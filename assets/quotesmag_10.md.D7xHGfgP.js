Kobbe. At the time it was located adjacent to Howard Air Force Base in the Panama Canal Zone. In the 1930s it was primarily a United States Army Coast Artillery Corps post. It was located on the west side of the Panama Canal. Most of the area around it was uninhabited (part of the Panama Canal Zone watershed), though Panama City could be reached by crossing the nearby Bridge of the Americas. An rock quarry was operated intermittently in the southwest corner of the Fort near the southern end of the Howard Air Force Base main runway. In the Fort, there was a series of barracks starting on the southern end of Howard Air Force Base in the level land adjacent to the southern end of Howard Air Force Base. In the hills on the east side of the fort were Officer's Married and Bachelor Quarters, and an Officer's Club. There was a small parade field and married NCO housing in the southern end of the Fort. There was a beach in the southeast corner of the fort going into the Pacific Ocean. The beach was protected by a large shark net, as it was understood that the waters in that part of the Pacific were shark-infested. The tides were almost 12', so the beach was not a pristine site. Given that Panamanian locals did not have access to the area, the beach was not used very heavily. The eastern half of Fort Kobbe was jungle stretching over to the western side of the mouth of the Panama Canal. The 33rd Infantry Regiment was reactivated at Fort Kobbe on 4 January 1950 and assumed responsibility for the entire Fort Kobbe/Howard Air Force Base post. The regiment was inactivated and redesignated as the 20th Infantry at Fort Kobbe in May 1956. The 20th Infantry was reorganized and redesignated 15 November 1957 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st Battle Group, 20th Infantry. It was inactivated 8 August 1962 at Fort Kobbe. Soon afterwards the 193rd Infantry Brigade was formed to expand ground forces available in the Southern Command area. In the 1980s it was a relatively small post, and housed a battalion of paratroopers (2/187th Rakkasans and later 1/508th ABN), a firing battery of artillery (Battery B 22 Field Artillery) M-102 105mm; six gun battery with survey and search light section, a company of engineers (518th ENG CO), and a helicopter battalion (210th Combat Avn BN). Around 1986, the 518th Engineer Company was expanded into the 536th Engineer Battalion. Known as the \\"Nation Builders\\", the unit was deployed all over Central and South America on humanitarian and infrastructure projects. The unit had a company of combat engineers, Bravo Company, that came from the old 518th. The other company, known as the \\"Road Dawgs\\" was a construction company. It consisted of dump trucks, graders, bulldozers, a complete quarry, a crane section, and mobile concrete trucks. The HQ Company had a well drilling detachment, as well as a Detachment of Army Divers. The unit would deploy to various undeveloped sites and, augmented with reserve troops from construction and medical units, would perform a wide variety of engineering and medical missions. This included road and bridge building, well drilling, building of churches and schools, and medical, dental, and veterinary clinics. In 2000, Fort Kobbe was decommissioned and control was turned over to the Republic of Panama. See also * Howard Air Force Base References External links  5th Inf. Regiment 193rd Inf.

It is known specially for its most notable craftsmanship: the ao po'i, a fine cloth made in cotton that could be seen in shirts, dresses, blouses, sheets and others. Hundreds of artisans of Yataity get ready for the \\"Typical Vestments Market\\" made in the central square every November. The annual expo of ao po'i is a chance for the artisans of the zone to show their creativity. This pieces shows up their fine finishing and high quality. It is estimated that around 2,200 people dedicate to the manufacture of ao po'i in this district, making of it a source of employment. Most of the specialized artisans are from Yataity, where thanks to the support of private companies, they could combine tradition and modernity for a trade of shirts that reunites the required quality standards for export. The ao po'i is made by hand in a 100% cotton fabric that appeared in the 18th Century due to the commercial lockout imposed by Gaspar Rodr√≠guez de Francia. The women had to manually tailor the cotton to make the vestments. ‚ÄúWe know that the production of ao po'i has extended to other places of the country, but we can assure that the best clothes made in ao po'i are from the artisans of Yataity\\" says the inhabitants of the district.

Like most other aminoglycosides, sisomicin is bactericidal for sensitive clinical isolates. The minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) have been found to be equivalent or very close to the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC). Like other aminoglycosides, most clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa remain susceptible to sisomicin. Resistance to sisomicin may be enzymatically or non-enzymatically mediated. Sisomicin is inactivated by the same enzymes as gentamicin, but it is active against many organisms that resist gentamicin by non-enzymatic mechanisms.

Founded December 22, 1965, it is located some 263 km from Asunci√≥n. Yataity del Norte gateway to reach the prosperous colony Uni√≥n and the December 25, which leads to a precarious dirt road. Posts sales of fruit, quaint bars and restaurants where they offer tasty dishes of home cooking are points of attraction to make a stop on the road, before continuing the journey. It is near the Arroyo Pe√±atei with a population of about 14.373 inhabitants. The vast majority are engaged in forestry, agriculture and livestock. Its population is distributed as follows, corresponds to 52% male and 47% females. This situation is equal to what happens in most departments of the interior of the country, which has found greater female migration to urban centres, usually seeking to improve their living conditions and his family. Hydrography The Northern District Yataity, is washed by the waters of the following streams: *Arroyo Pa√±atei. *Arroyo Tapiracu√°i. Economy Much of the department of San Pedro, as well as the district's economy is mainly agricultural, occupying a prominent place in beef production, as well as its agriculture has increased considerably thanks to the fertility of its soil. The city is a major centre of activity that includes livestock production coil, equine, swine, sheep. In agriculture there are crops in the district of horticulture, oranges (sweet and sour), banana, sunflower, herb, matt, mandioca. The Department of San Pedro is among those with lower socio-economic indicators, noted however that in recent years there have been significant advances, which allow people punished instead of acquiring better quality of life. The 63% of the population is poor and the department while the rest of the population is not considered poor, the gaps are very marked, their average monthly income per family, the Guaran√≠ sum of 490,812, representing an income per person Guaran√≠ monthly average of 89,573. Roads In the district of Yataity del Norte, can be accessed by Route 8 \\"Dr. Bl√°s Garay\\", the other existing roads in the district are without pavement, roads are totally some kind of paving. Today, this district has public transport services with services interdistrict services and newspapers until the country's capital, Ciudad del Este, Pedro Juan Caballero, Brazil, Argentina and Chile. In communication, most have access to phone and now with satellite systems. Climate In the second department of San Pedro, the weather is predominantly rainy and humid. The same goes for the Northern District Yataity, that its climate is humid and rainy; the relative humidity is 70 to 80%. The average is 23 ¬∞C, the highest in summer is 35 ¬∞C and at least 10 ¬∞C. Language Just as much of the population of the entire department of San Pedro, in the district of Yataity del Norte, also dominated the Guaran√≠ language that approximately over 70% of the population speaks Spanish and Guaran√≠-(yopara) is spoken by 30% of the remaining population. Geography Bordered on the north by the District of San Estanislao. To the south lies the Fifth Department of Caaguaz√∫. To the east is separated from the Fifth Department of Caaguaz√∫, by the stream Tapiracu√° i. To the west lies the District Union. Education This district, as well as much of the second department of San Pedro, has primary schools, and also the average level, in which children and young people attending regularly, illiteracy exists is because of extreme poverty in which much of their people are mired, making it difficult to send their children to school, this affects especially women, but men are not exempt from this problem. The indigenous bias also has access to primary education but with little notice by them, which is also due to the same reasons. The working population lacks a reasonable level of qualification, which conspires against the development of the area, so it does not have trained manpower, lack of instructions or programs and projects related to the topic. Health Throughout the second Department of San Pedro and not just in this district, which is perceived is a tremendous gap in these subjects, although must admit that in recent years show a marked improvement in the health sector. Currently the department has several posts and health centres, spread over much of the department of San Pedro, but will stress that they are equipped with a minimum, so that relative importance of care for the sick must be transferred to other care centres, usually in the capital and surrounding areas.

Critically Important Antimicrobials for Human Medicine 3rd revision. 2011 Resistance against aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as ribostamycin, is a growing concern.

The Journal of Antibiotics. 2009, 62, 471-481.  Biosynthesis  The biosynthesis of ribostamycin begins with the sugar, D-glucose, which is phosphorylated at the 6 position to form glucose-6-phosphate. The enzyme rbmA contains a genetic sequence that corresponds to NAD+ binding and catalyzes the formation of 2-deoxy-scyllo- inosose. The enzyme rmbB then catalyzes the transamination of 2-deoxy-scyllo- inosose to 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine with L-glutamine and pyridoxal phosphate (PLP). Enzyme rbmC oxidizes the ring to 2-deoxy-3-amino-scyllo-inosose, which is then transaminated by enzyme rmbB to DOS. DOS is then glycosylated by the glycosyltransferase rmbD with uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP- Glc-NAc) to form 2‚Äô-N-acetylparomamine. The deacetylase, racJ, removes the acetyl group and forms paromamine. Paromamine is oxidized by enzyme rbmG and then enzyme rmbH transaminates to produce neamine. Neamine is then ribosylated to form ribostamycin., Biosynthetic patway for ribostamycin  References  Aminoglycoside antibiotics ","title":"Ribostamycin"},{"id":"16058845","text":"Dibekacin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic.

The town was founded March 23, 1538 by the Spanish Governor Domingo Mart√≠nez de Irala. Its main activities are trade and industry. Origins The original name of the indigenous people was Pitum, a Guarani expression that means 'medicinal water'. The present town name of Ypan√© refers to one of the three streams Ypan√©, Potrerito, and Ytoror√≥, which flow into the Paraguay River. The name Ypan√© is composed of 'Y' meaning water, 'pa' meaning 'water running and emptying into a river' and 'ne' the smell of est√©rales and dry streams, in times of drought. History In the early years, Ypan√© was a predominantly agricultural town. Other activities were added later, such as hunting, fishing and rice cultivation. It is known today as a \\"Garden City\\". Ypan√© was a Franciscan reduction to 1538, and founded on March 23 of the same year by the Spanish Governor Domingo Mart√≠nez de Irala. It was founded for the second time on May 6, 1862, when the Franciscans returned to Paraguay. In the year 1911 the people of Ypan√© were transferred from their original territory of the spot where the Villa Real is located today, at south latitude 25¬∞ 27' 44\\". The colours of the flag of the city are green, the colour of hope, and yellow, symbolizing the sun's light toward a new dawn. The idea behind these is the evolution of Ypan√© from a historic city to a garden city. Demographics Ypan√© has 34,943 inhabitants, of whom 17,696 are male and 17,247 female, and an annual growth rate of 3.61% according to the Direcci√≥n General de Estad√≠sticas, Encuestas y Censos. About 34% of the population is urban and the remaining 57% rural. Area Ypan√© district extends over 5,220 has (7,552 m¬≤), which gives it a population density of 3.5 inhabitants per hectare. Neighborhoods *Lomas verdes *6 de junio *Ytororo *Colonia Thompson Climate The climate in Ypane is tropical, with seasonal variations depending on the relative dominance of tropical and polar air masses. The maximum temperature occurs in summer, reaching 39¬∞C, or even more at times. The minimum temperature during winter is 1¬∞C, with an annual average of 22¬∞C. Rainfall is about 1433 mm annually, heaviest between the months of January and April and more scarce in the period between June and August. Economy The main activities are trade and industry, as well as agricultural cultivation, primarily rice, horticultural crops and fruit trees. The textile industry is distinguished by fabrics made of cotton, such as hammocks, handbags, quilts. Some residents are engaged in the development of √±andut√≠. Tourism Tourist attractions include the former San Pedro Ap√≥stol Church, built by the Indians of the reduction under the direction of the Franciscan Fathers, in the times of the colonization of the Americas. It is located in the heart of the city. The high altar is a national heritage. The patron saint of Ypan√© is San Pedro Apostol, who is remembered with various activities on June 29 every year. One of the main attractions is the monument to the Saint of Love, Valentine, located in the hollow of an old tree in the ancient Square of St. Peter the Apostle. This monument is at the center of a large heart shape traced on the surface, and as the town's inhabitants say, if someone (or a couple) makes a wish to the saint, and then walks around the heart, their wish will receive the blessing of St. Valentine. During the Paraguayan War (fought by Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay against Paraguay), the battle of Ytoror√≥ was waged on December 6, 1868 and today at its location there is a monument built in tribute to the Paraguayan heroes. And where the Battle of Avay ('indigenous water') was fought, a bust of the Paraguayan Marshal Francisco Solano L√≥pez was installed. On the campus of San Pedro Ap√≤stol's Square there is a fountain named Centro de Atracci√≥n Tur√≠stico Municipal, reflecting the history and significance of the city of Ypan√©, where the course of the three streams to their mouths in the Paraguay River can be admired. Near Ypan√© the vast lagoon of Yvera, a short distance from Nueva Italia can be visited, with wetlands brimming with life. The city lacks a developed tourist infrastructure with airports, hotels, restaurants, shopping centers, and other important factors which would enable better exploitation of this area.

These men arrived in Utah in the summer of that year, and though they were cordially welcomed, they soon came into conflict with the Latter-day Saint settlers of the territory. The confrontation centered on Mormon social practices such as plural marriage, which the appointees vocally and publicly denigrated, and disagreements over territorial administration with newly appointed Governor Brigham Young. By the end of September 1851, each of these officers left his Utah appointment for the east and their posts remained unfilled for the next two years. This was the first in a series of disagreements between the Mormon residents of Utah Territory and the United States government which would finally result in the Utah War of 1857‚Äì1858. Background Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), sometimes called Mormon pioneers, settled in what is now Utah in July 1847. The Saints had purposefully left the United States and come to what was then a part of Mexico due to the severe persecution which they had endured in several eastern states since their religion was founded in 1830. They hoped that in the empty deserts of the Great Basin they could worship as they pleased and create a utopian community called Zion without outside interference. However, most of the American Southwest was transferred to the United States following the American victory in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. In addition, discharged Latter-day Saint soldiers who had served in the Mormon Battalion during the Mexican War helped discover gold at Sutter's Mill in California in 1848. The resultant California Gold Rush brought thousands of emigrants across the country and curtailed the Mormons' short-lived isolation. As a result, in 1849 the Latter-day Saints petitioned Congress that a huge swath of land which they had settled be admitted into the Union as the State of Deseret. Their proposed state stretched from central Colorado to southern California, and from the middle of Idaho to southern Arizona. The Mormons hoped for statehood so that they would have the ability to elect their own leaders, and hopefully avoid the persecution which they had so recently escaped. Because of their previous experiences, the Latter-day Saints were convinced that self-governance was the only safeguard to their religious freedom, and they worried about the possible introduction of \\"unsympathetic carpetbag appointees\\" if Deseret were relegated to territorial status. However, Congress instead incorporated \\"Deseret\\" into the greatly reduced but still enormous Utah Territory as part of the Compromise of 1850. John M. Bernhisel, a Mormon representative in Washington, D.C., strenuously lobbied President Fillmore for an all-Mormon slate of territorial officials. He urged the president that \\"the people of Utah cannot but consider it their right, as American citizens to be governed by men of their own choice, entitled to their confidence, and united with them in opinion and feeling.\\"LDS Church, Church History in the Fullness of Times Student Manual, 354. The president therefore appointed Brigham Young, President and Prophet of the LDS Church, as the territory's governor, and assigned prominent positions to several other Mormons. But, Fillmore also gave a number of territorial appointments to non- Mormons or \\"Gentiles.\\" Arrival of officials Fillmore's territorial officials began to arrive in Utah in the summer of 1851, and they were warmly welcomed by the Mormons regardless of their religious affiliation. For instance, Judge Brandenbury, a non-Mormon, was the first to arrive and was honored by a banquet and several dances. Territorial Secretary Harris and his wife, both \\"Gentiles,\\" traveled to Utah with Bernhisel, and upon arriving on July 19 were greeted by a group of Mormons with a basket of fruit and champagne. Historian Norman Furniss states that > this enthusiastic reception was not a hypocritical pose, for Young and his > colleagues were prepared to think well of their first Gentile officials. But > for all that, the concord was soon broken. Donald Moorman writes that the arrival of non-Mormon federal officials in Utah followed a predictable pattern, beginning with \\"an introductory phase of amicable relations with the Church that quickly degenerated into a period of acrimonious dispute.\\" Relations sour The relationship between the \\"Gentile\\" officials and the Latter-day Saints quickly broke down despite the initial good will. For instance, Secretary Harris had been entrusted with $24,000 in gold and the territorial seal to deliver to Governor Young. However, he refused to turn these funds or the seal over to Young when he discovered that the 1850 territorial census had been taken without his certification, despite the fact that he had not yet arrived in the territory. This condition was worsened by a public address from non-Mormon Judge Brocchus in September. July 24, or Pioneer Day as it is known in Utah, is the anniversary of the Mormons' arrival in the Salt Lake Valley in 1847. At their Pioneer Day festivities in 1851, the Mormons' celebrations as they often did included orations which rehearsed their years of persecution in Missouri and Illinois, and condemned the US government and President Zachary Taylor in particular for their ill treatment. Several months later, Judge Brocchus was given an opportunity to address the crowd at the General Conference of the LDS Church. Brocchus has been described as a man \\"at times disarmingly charming, at other times biterly sardonic...His face was marked by frequent brawls, for he often engaged his opponents with a quick resort to his fists.\\" Having heard of the Mormons' accusations against the government on Pioneer Day, he took on this later visage and loudly reprimanded the Saints for their lack of patriotism and morality, and making an unmistakable inference to the Mormon practice of plural marriage, proceeded to lecture the women in the audience on the importance of virtue. The Latter-day Saint crowd now in an uproar, Brigham Young calmed the audience but issued a blistering diatribe against Brocchus in which he stated that he could have \\"loosed the congregation upon Brocchus with a gesture of his little finger, but he satisfied himself with a tongue- lashing.\\" In fact, Brocchus' aversion to polygamy and other Mormon social practices was general among the non-Mormon officials. Furniss states that Secretary Harris and his wife in particular \\"were prepared to treat the Mormons as they would a tribe of Arapahoe Indians - not as animals, exactly, but certainly not as civilized people.\\" The condescension with which the federal appointees and their families treated the Mormons created a further source of tension between them. Runaways Brigham Young tried to repair the breach between the community and the non-Mormon officials through a series of letters in late September. However, by this point the damage had been done. Harris, Brandenbury, and Brocchus concluded that they could not fulfill their assignments in Utah, and they feared for their physical safety. The three men therefore left Utah for the east on September 28, 1851, less than three months after they had arrived in the Territory. The \\"Runaways\\" maintained possession of the $24,000 earmarked for the Territory and the territorial seal despite a lawsuit by Young to obtain them in the days before the officers left. The day after the disgruntled officials departed Salt Lake City, Young wrote a strongly worded letter to President Fillmore defending the Mormons' patriotism, attacking the character of Perry E. Brocchus and the others, and suggesting that territorial residents be appointed to federal office. When the officials arrived in Washington without incident, they wrote a report of conditions in Utah which \\"left unclear whether the people habitually kicked their dogs; otherwise their calendar of infamy in Utah was complete.\\" Norman Furniss writes, > It is of no value to weigh the truthfulness of Brigham Young's assertions > and the Runaways' counterattack. The Church, whether understandably or not, > was in a mood incompatible with submissive acceptance of territorial status. > For their part, Brocchus and the others had shown a remarkable indifference > to the feelings of their temporary constituents, had without due cause > deserted their offices, and had explained their behavior with statements of > at best partial accuracy. However, the accusations of the Runaways created a firestorm for the Fillmore Administration and in Congress. Bernhisel and Thomas L. Kane of Philadelphia patiently lobbied for the Mormons in Washington. However, rumors flew about the capital that Brigham Young would be replaced as governor, or even that federal troops would be dispatched to Utah. But, by June 1852, the controversy had subsided. Congress passed a statute depriving any territorial officials of pay if they were absent from their assignments without due cause, and Daniel Webster advised Judge Perry E. Brocchus to either resign his position or return to the territory. Results The \\"Runaways\\" never returned to Utah Territory and their positions remained unfilled until 1853. This is no doubt the reason that the Utah Legislature conferred original jurisdiction in both criminal and civil cases to the probate courts in 1852. This essentially gave the local Mormon-controlled probate courts concurrent jurisdiction with the federal district courts, and while it allowed for efficiency in justice without a full complement of federal judges, the move was denounced by later federal officials. The eventual replacements of Judges Brocchus and Brandebury were both \\"Gentiles,\\" but generally friendly to the Latter-day Saints. This brought a measure of peace between Utah and the federal government until both of these men died in 1855. They were replaced by Judge John F. Kinney, and Judge W. W. Drummond, both of whom exhibited open hostility to the Mormons. The disputes between these officials and the Mormon hierarchy would result in the Utah War two years later. See also *John W.

During this period, the University of Kentucky faced many challenges including the desegregation of both the graduate and undergraduate divisions, an influx of veterans as a result of the G.I. Bill, and political interference from legislators in Frankfort. A native of Maysville, Kentucky, on the Ohio River, Donovan was the first student enrolled at the Western Kentucky State Normal School (now Western Kentucky University), graduating in 1908. He later attended the University of Kentucky, Columbia University, and George Peabody School for Teachers (now Peabody College of Vanderbilt University) in Nashville, Tennessee, from which he earned his Ph.D. At Columbia University, Donovan was firmly schooled in the educational idea of Progressivism, and later he headed Eastern Kentucky Normal School (now called Eastern Kentucky University) from 1928 to 1941 in Richmond, Kentucky, before being called to head UK. Donovan believed that the state of Kentucky should be UK's campus, and he was fond of saying, \\"You cannot have a great state without a great state university.\\" He wrote about his experiences as a teacher, builder, and administrator in the memoir Keeping the University Free and Growing, published in 1959. Particularly notable is Donovan's chapter on integration, in which he discusses the case of Lyman Johnson, the Louisville history schoolteacher who won the right to attend the university's graduate school under court order in 1949. Donovan was married to Nell Stuart and died in 1964. He is buried in Lexington Cemetery, not far from the grave of Coach Adolph Rupp, who won several NCAA championships at UK while Donovan was president. References *Donovan, Herman Lee.

Hilbert C*-modules were first introduced in the work of Irving Kaplansky in 1953, which developed the theory for commutative, unital algebras (though Kaplansky observed that the assumption of a unit element was not \\"vital\\"). In the 1970s the theory was extended to non-commutative C*-algebras independently by William Lindall Paschke and Marc Rieffel, the latter in a paper which used Hilbert C*-modules to construct a theory of induced representations of C*-algebras. Hilbert C*-modules are crucial to Kasparov's formulation of KK-theory, and provide the right framework to extend the notion of Morita equivalence to C*-algebras. They can be viewed as the generalization of vector bundles to noncommutative C*-algebras and as such play an important role in noncommutative geometry, notably in C*-algebraic quantum group theory, and groupoid C*-algebras.  Definitions  = Inner-product A-modules = Let A be a C*-algebra (not assumed to be commutative or unital), its involution denoted by *. An inner-product A-module (or pre-Hilbert A-module) is a complex linear space E which is equipped with a compatible right A-module structure, together with a map : \\\\langle \\\\cdot, \\\\cdot \\\\rangle : E \\\\times E \\\\rightarrow A which satisfies the following properties: *For all x, y, z in E, and Œ±, Œ≤ in C: :: \\\\langle x, \\\\alpha y + \\\\beta z \\\\rangle = \\\\alpha \\\\langle x, y \\\\rangle + \\\\beta \\\\langle x, z \\\\rangle :(i.e. the inner product is linear in its second argument). *For all x, y in E, and a in A: :: \\\\langle x, y a \\\\rangle = \\\\langle x, y \\\\rangle a *For all x, y in E: :: \\\\langle x, y \\\\rangle = \\\\langle y, x \\\\rangle^*, :from which it follows that the inner product is conjugate linear in its first argument (i.e. it is a sesquilinear form). *For all x in E: :: \\\\langle x, x \\\\rangle \\\\geq 0 :and :: \\\\langle x, x \\\\rangle = 0 \\\\iff x = 0. :(An element of a C*-algebra A is said to be positive if it is self-adjoint with non-negative spectrum.)In the case when A is non-unital, the spectrum of an element is calculated in the C*-algebra generated by adjoining a unit to A. = Hilbert A-modules = An analogue to the Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality holds for an inner-product A-module E:This result in fact holds for semi-inner-product A-modules, which may have non-zero elements x such that = 0, as the proof does not rely on the nondegeneracy property. :\\\\langle x, y \\\\rangle \\\\langle y, x \\\\rangle \\\\leq \\\\Vert \\\\langle y, y \\\\rangle \\\\Vert \\\\langle x, x \\\\rangle for x, y in E. On the pre-Hilbert module E, define a norm by :\\\\Vert x \\\\Vert = \\\\Vert \\\\langle x, x \\\\rangle \\\\Vert^\\\\frac{1}{2}. The norm-completion of E, still denoted by E, is said to be a Hilbert A-module or a Hilbert C*-module over the C*-algebra A. The Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality implies the inner product is jointly continuous in norm and can therefore be extended to the completion. The action of A on E is continuous: for all x in E :a_{\\\\lambda} \\\\rightarrow a \\\\Rightarrow xa_{\\\\lambda} \\\\rightarrow xa. Similarly, if {eŒª} is an approximate unit for A (a net of self-adjoint elements of A for which aeŒª and eŒªa tend to a for each a in A), then for x in E : xe_\\\\lambda \\\\rightarrow x whence it follows that EA is dense in E, and x1 = x when A is unital. Let : \\\\langle E, E \\\\rangle = \\\\operatorname{span} \\\\\\\\{ \\\\langle x, y \\\\rangle x, y \\\\in E \\\\\\\\}, then the closure of is a two-sided ideal in A. Two-sided ideals are C*-subalgebras and therefore possess approximate units. One can verify that E is dense in E. In the case when is dense in A, E is said to be full. This does not generally hold.  Examples  = Hilbert spaces = A complex Hilbert space H is a Hilbert C-module under its inner product, the complex numbers being a C*-algebra with an involution given by complex conjugation. =Vector bundles= If X is a locally compact Hausdorff space and E a vector bundle over X with a Riemannian metric g, then the space of continuous sections of E is a Hilbert C(X)-module. The inner product is given by :: \\\\langle f,h\\\\rangle (x):=g(f(x),h(x)). The converse holds as well: Every countably generated Hilbert C*-module over a commutative C*-algebra A = C(X) is isomorphic to the space of sections vanishing at infinity of a continuous field of Hilbert spaces over X. = C*-algebras = Any C*-algebra A is a Hilbert A-module under the inner product = a*b. By the C*-identity, the Hilbert module norm coincides with C*-norm on A. The (algebraic) direct sum of n copies of A : A^n = \\\\oplus_1^n A can be made into a Hilbert A-module by defining :\\\\langle (a_i), (b_i) \\\\rangle = \\\\sum a_i^* b_i. One may also consider the following subspace of elements in the countable direct product of A : \\\\ell_2(A)= \\\\mathcal{H}_A = \\\\\\\\{ (a_i) \\\\sum a_i^{*}a_i\\\\text{ converges in }A \\\\\\\\}. Endowed with the obvious inner product (analogous to that of An), the resulting Hilbert A-module is called the standard Hilbert module.

Stewardship of much of the lagoon is held by the Encina Power Station and its owner NRG Energy. In November 2000 the Agua Hedionda Lagoon was designated as a critical habitat for the tidewater goby. The Carlsbad Watershed Network website Public access The Agua Hedionda Lagoon is open to the public as a passive recreation area. The lagoon is known as a place to walk, and for stand-up paddleboard, kayaking, wakeboarding, waterskiing, jet skiing, and wave runnering. The lagoon is also a public social destination, with events and gatherings. The lagoon sees most of its visitors during summer. Its location within the city of Carlsbad leads to its occasional reference as the ‚ÄúCarlsbad Lagoon.‚Äù Passive Recreation Areas Legal definition: \\"A passive recreation area is an undeveloped space or environmentally sensitive area that requires minimal development. Entities such as a parks department may maintain passive recreation areas for the well-being of the public and for the preservation of wildlife and the environment. The quality of the environment and \\"naturalness\\" of an area is the focus of the recreational experience in a passive recreation area.\\" There is public access via Bay Shore Drive, which is open for walking traffic from sunrise to sunset. Walking is the primary way of visiting, and vehicles may not drive through when it is closed for pedestrian use. Vehicles are highly limited as it is not environmentally beneficial or safe on the shoreline. =Regulations= Regulations have been enacted on visitors in order to a reduce pollution on the lagoon, including a prohibition on alcohol consumption. Bottles and cans can harm the endangered species that are present. Parasailing, hovercrafts, cabin cruisers, motorized surfboards, and aircraft are prohibited on the shorelines of the bay. Visitors are also forbidden from leaving vessels on the lagoon. Public events must be approved by the City of Carlsbad Parks and Recreations Department and during these scheduled proceedings, swimming or wading are not allowed. A vessel permit is required for launching access from the shoreline. Fishing and boating Fishing is a popular activity at this lagoon. However, limitations are also implemented. There are designated fishing areas in the lower east end of the lagoon due to algae hampering fishing in other parts of the lagoon. Boats are not allowed to anchor, because doing so would disrupt the lagoon's natural environment and endanger the species that live in the waters. In addition, all California Fish and Game Laws are highly enforced during this activity. There is a fishing license requirement for those 16 years and older. Shoreline fishing is allowed from all public access shorelines in all parts of the lagoon; fishing from a vessel is only allowed in the passive recreation areas. =Agua Hedionda Lagoon Discovery Center= The Agua Hedionda Lagoon Discovery Center is a nature center for education about the local natural history, ecology, and cultural history of the lagoon and surrounding area. The Lagoon Discovery Center has an award-winning Environmental Stewardship School Program aimed at local 3rd graders which incorporates hands-on learning on Lagoon history, archaeology, Native American culture, migratory birds, and watersheds and wetlands. The Discovery Center also holds numerous free family festivals throughout the year, as well as free monthly lectures and birding hikes. The center opened in 2006 and features a large California native plant garden, and expansive lagoon views. The natural habitat is Coastal sage scrub. Dredging Dredging Agua Hedionda Lagoon has occurred every two to four years since 1954. Prior to the beginning of dredging, the lagoon was not connected to the Pacific Ocean. There are 500,000 cubic yards of sand pulled up from the bottom of the lagoon through this dredging. In 2014, about half of the sand pulled out went to a stretch of the beach between the intake and outlet jetties just outside the lagoon. The remaining sand was split between the beach at Tamarack and Oak Avenues, and the shoreline just south of the lagoon. The Encina Power Station, owned by NRG Energy, is on the lagoon and pays for the dredging. The power plant was commissioned in 1954, which is when the first dredging was recorded. Its location on the lagoon's southern shore, allows the lagoon water to be used for cooling the power plant. This power station is fueled by non- renewable natural gas. It is one the main sources of energy in San Diego metropolitan area. Lagoon dredging supports two aquaculture businesses in the Carlsbad vicinity: the Carlsbad Aqua Farm which raises and sells oysters and mussels; and the Hubbs-Seaworld Institute, which operates a hatchery for White Sea bass. According to Kasia Trojanowska, the Carlsbad Parks Planner, ‚Äúthe dredging puts sand back on the beach so that beach goers have a nice sandy spot to place their towels.\\" Dredging maintains the tidal circulation of the lagoon and creates a larger beach that is free of rocks for a while. Desalinization plant The Carlsbad desalination plant at the lagoon will be able provide 50 million gallons of desalinated water per day. There are coastal and marine environmental concerns regarding the plant. By 2017, Poseidon Water will take over dredging responsibilities from NRG Energy.

Career Fingleton is best known for his analyses since the mid-1980s of the Japanese business, financial, and manufacturing system, and he has applied lessons from Japan's experience to US, European, and other policy questions. As deputy editor of the international banking magazine Euromoney in the late 1980s, he questioned the sustainability of Japan's super-high land and stock values.Fingleton, Eamonn (September 1987).\\"Why Japan's Banks Are Shaky\\". Euromoney, pp. 57‚Äì65. He was one of the earliest critics of financialisation, arguing that there is no substitute for advanced manufacturing industries (highly capital-intensive, know-how-intensive industries typically making capital equipment, new materials, and leading edge components) as the main pillar of an advanced economy.(18 October 1999) \\"In Praise of Hard Industries ‚Äì A prominent economic commentator tells why manufacturing, not the information economy, is the key to the future prosperity of the U.S.\\" IndustryWeek. Fingleton suggests that the United States made a catastrophic mistake in the 1990s in allowing leadership in such industries to pass to Japan. This was a major theme of his 1995 book Blindside: Why Japan Is Still on Track to Overtake the US by the Year 2000. It was named one of the Ten Best Business Books of 1995 by BusinessWeek.12/18/95 The Best Business Books of 1995 In 2012, he wrote an article for The New York Times Sunday Review called \\"The Myth of Japan's Failure\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/08/opinion/sunday/the-true-story-of- japans-economic-success.html?pagewanted=all which updated his view that Japan has continued to best the United States all through the \\"lost decade\\". The article drew wide commentary. His second US-published book, In Praise of Hard Industries: Why Manufacturing, Not the Information Economy, Is the Key to Future Prosperity, published in 1999, took a contrarian stance on the New Economy. His most recent book, In the Jaws of the Dragon, argues that China is not converging to Western values but rather is following the Confucian econo- political model pioneered by Japan and characterised by aggressive mercantilism as well as a state-directed economy. In the Jaws of the Dragon, holtzbrinckpublishers.com. Retrieved 11 March 2015.

Retrieved 11 March 2015. As a member of a US financial delegation led by New York Stock Exchange chairman John J. Phelan, he met Deng Xiaoping at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing in 1986. He has repeatedly challenged intellectual opponents to a public debate on the Japanese economy. In the case of two of his most prominent opponents, he offered to make a $10,000 donation to a good cause of their choice if either was prepared to join him for a public discussion. The offer was not taken up.http://www.fingleton.net/the-truth-of-japans-slump-an- invitation-to-a- debate/https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/02/the-myth-of- japans-lost- decades/71741/https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/06/eamonn- fingleton-makes-a-10-000-offer/240850/ Ideas Fingleton's analysis of East Asian economics is founded on a counterintuitive concept called suppressed consumption. He holds that by suppressing consumption, a government can powerfully boost a nation's savings rate. In an address to the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences in 2008, he stated: \\"The resulting huge flows of capital are.... channeled via state controlled banks towards those corporations deemed most likely to make effective use of the money in boosting productivity.\\" \\"How is consumption suppressed? The most obvious method is via tight controls on consumer credit. Less obviously the economy is regulated to make it physically difficult for consumers to consume (for instance, by severely limiting access to imported luxuries and by tightly restricting the supply of housing space). Sometimes the resulting savings arise in the hands of consumers. In many cases, however, they accrue to corporations in the form of super-high retained profits. Such profits are then used to build national muscle in targeted industries. A typical arrangement is that cartels keep consumer prices high, thereby allowing member firms to earn the necessary high returns to keep investing at a fast pace in the export side of their business. Cartels are generally given free rein provided only that they serve the national goal of boosting productivity.\\"http://www.fingleton.net/pursuing-prosperity-address- to-the-ukrainian-academy-of-sciences-2/ Fingleton emphasises the degree to which Japan and other advanced manufacturing nations such as Germany have established global monopolies ‚Äì in his terms \\"chokepoints\\" ‚Äì in supplying little-noticed but vital materials, components, and production machinery without which less advanced manufacturing nations such as China could not manufacture consumer goods. Writing in the New Republic in 2011, he commented: \\"[A]s world manufacturing has become more technologically advanced, it is more likely that a single supplier, or even a single factory, can be critical to a whole industry. And we know that, in this vein, Japanese corporations enjoy monopolies or oligopolies in a host of crucial niches in supplying advanced materials, components and production machinery for industries like electronics, cars, and aerospace. In two books in the 1990s, I made a sustained effort to track Japan's more important manufacturing 'chokepoints,' as they are known to customers. I succeeded in identifying close to 100. Some are well known, such as the YKK Company's global lock on zip fasteners and Shimano's dominance in bicycle gears. Many have hitherto gone largely unnoticed, but are actually much more important to the smooth functioning of the world economy. A good example is semiconductor-grade silicon‚Äîa highly purified not-an-atom-out-of-place material that only a couple of companies worldwide can make. The leading suppliers, Shin-Etsu and Sumco, are both Japanese and, as far as I can tell, there are no significant suppliers left in either Europe or America.\\"https://newrepublic.com/article/85236/japan- earthquake-tsunami-industry- economyhttp://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/03/06/8370712/index.htm Fingleton writes that a crucial part of Japan's strategy is to keep its most advanced production technologies at home, thereby maximising the productivity advantage of its home workforce. In testimony to the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission in 2005, he stated: \\"It is taken for granted in Japan that production technologies are as much the nation's property as they are the property of the corporations that developed them‚Ä¶. It is assumed by all concerned that the latest technologies will be applied in the first instance in factories at home, thereby giving Japanese workers a vital edge in global competition. Any decision to move the technologies abroad will be the result of a government-guided industry consensus. Thus although corporate Japan has transferred significant production technologies to China in recent years, it has never given away the crown jewels.\\"http://china.usc.edu/sites/default/files/article/attachments/USCC%202005%20Apr.pdfhttp://china.usc.edu/us- china-economic-and-security-review-commission-hearing-chinas-high-technology- development-april-21 As for Japan's \\"lost decades,\\" Fingleton holds that slower growth in recent years is largely explained by a demographic switchback. In sharp contrast with earlier years when Japan experienced fast population growth, in recent years there has been a consistent reduction of about 1 percent a year in the working-age population. While this has applied a steady brake to growth in headline GDP, growth in per-worker output has continued at satisfactory levels. The demographic trend moreover is largely explained by a policy of population reduction, similar to, if less draconian than, China's one-child policy. Japan's policy, which has been aimed at improving the nation's food security, began with the Eugenic Protection Act of 1948, which introduced various measures to reduce the birthrate, most notably easy abortion.https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/24/financial- times-buyout-japan-successhttp://www.fingleton.net/myths-of-the-japanese- economy/https://www.forbes.com/sites/eamonnfingleton/2013/08/11/now-for-the- truth-the-story-of-japans-lost-decades-is-the-worlds-most-absurd-media- myth/#2becc714483f Books *In the Jaws of the Dragon: America's Fate in the Coming Era of Chinese Hegemony (2008).

The lake lies in the western part of the Asunci√≥n-Sapucai- Villarrica graben, a tectonic depression from the Mesozoic Era, and drains to the northwest through the Salado River into the Paraguay River. The lake is surrounded by three cities: Aregu√°, Ypacara√≠, and San Bernardino, the latter two being located on its shore. The song ‚ÄúMemories of Ypacara√≠‚Äù, written by Demetrio Ortiz, caused the lake to become widely known. It is one of Paraguay's two main lakes and the site of many leisure activities. During the summer, locals and tourists enjoyed its beaches and the landscape. As a result of the proliferation of toxic algae or cyanobacteria, the lake is the most polluted in Paraguay. The government has banned access to its waters. Aregua beach Geography The area of Ypacara√≠ Lake is about . It is long north‚Äìsouth and long east‚Äìwest. The average depth of the water is roughly . The lake flows into the Salado River, which itself enters the Paraguay River and receives water from various bodies, of water such as the Yagua Resau, Yuquyry, Puente Estrella and Pirayu. Weather The weather at the lake is temperate and sunny days are frequent. Temperatures vary between during summer and during winter. History The lake's original name was Tapycua. There are several possible explanations for the name. Ypacara√≠ means \\"holy lake\\" and is linked to the legend of the blessing of the lake by Luis de Bola√±os around 1600. Art and culture Iglesia de la Candelaria, Aregu√° The nearby town of Aregu√° offers permanent art and crafts exhibitions. The city's structure and antique architecture and are noteworthy. The artisan center of La Cuenca hosts a fair where local artists exhibit their work. Visitors and tourists can obtain information at the cultural center Estacion A; there is also an art center, the Guaggari Center, which is located at the entrance to the city and includes a sculpture exhibition. La Casa de la Cultura is a historical museum where temporary exhibitions are also presented. It opens for an important festival that takes place in September. Ypacara√≠ Festival has been held every year in the city of Ypacara√≠ since 1971. The popular September gathering encourages folk expression and Paraguayan art, including concerts, dance and theater. According to the City Chamber, the festival ‚Äútries to rescue and reinforce the artistic heritage of the Paraguayan culture‚Äù. Casa Hassler, a cultural center, is open for the whole year, with permanent and temporary exhibitions. Artists can show their work here for free, and there is also a history museum, a public library, and classes in acting and dance. Tourism As Ypacara√≠ is a relatively shallow lake, boats and small ships can navigate it easily. The lake is surrounded by cities with facilities necessary for tourists and other visitors. The lake's beaches are open to the public, and they are very popular during summer, especially with people from San Bernardino. View from San Bernardino =San Bernardino= This city is from Asunci√≥n. It has beaches, cultural centers, pubs, and interesting restaurants. San Bernardino is also called the ‚ÄúSummer City‚Äù because of its facilities and attractions for visitors during that season. =Aregu√°= Aregu√° is from Asunci√≥n and has a charming, bohemian atmosphere. It is a favorite place for writers and well-known personalities. This city also has a public beach. Aregu√° holds an artisan fair where locals offer pottery and clay figures. Gastronomy The cities surrounding the lake offer a variety of gastronomic styles, including both fast food and traditional dishes. Fruit salads, pastries, chipas, and empanadas are among the dishes available. Travel The lake is visible when visiting one of the surrounding cities.

Named after Francisco Isidoro Resqu√≠n it was established in 1981 by decision of Alfredo Stroessner. It has about 22,350 inhabitants who engage in agriculture and trade in the capital of the department (San Pedro del Ycuamandyy√∫). It is separated from the Canindey√∫, (formerly called Canendiy√∫) by the river Jeju√≠ Guaz√∫.  Hydrography  Apart from the Paraguay River department's major rivers are tributaries of the same: * Aguara Guazu * Jeju√¨ Guaz√∫, . * It has also streams Tajhekil, and the stream Cartei Cu√© which are tributaries of the river Aguara Guazu. The district has the following ports: Puerto San Vincente and Puerto San Jose both on the river Jeju√≠ Guaz√∫. Climate  It is wet and rainy; the relative humidity is 70 to 80%. The average temperature is 23 ¬∞C, the highest in summer (in January) is 35 ¬∞C and the minimum is 10 ¬∞C.  Roads  This district is accessible by Route 3 General Elizardo Aquino. Its routes are without pavement, roads have all types of paving. This district has public transport services with interdistrict services and newspapers until Asunci√≥n Ciudad del Este Pedro Juan Caballero Argentina, Brazil and Chile. In terms of telephone communication, most services have dialups and now with satellite systems.  Geography  Bordered on the north by the District Santa Rosa del Aguaray, it is separated by the river Aguaray Guaz√∫. To the south are districts: Guayaib√≠ and Chor√©; two districts of the river separating the Jejui Guaz√∫. At the west lies the district of Lima (San Pedro). By This is the XIV Canindey√∫ Department and XIII Department of Amambay.  Indigenous communities  Within indigenous communities that exist in the district include the following: * Santa Carolina (Yvy Ju). * Ka¬¥a Poty - San Vicente. * Naranjito - San Vicente. * Tahekyi ‚Äì San Luis. * Yvoty Hu.  Economy  Its soil is suitable for agriculture as for the livestock. The city is a major centre of activity that includes livestock production of cattle, horses, sheep and pigs. In agriculture, the following crops are produced in the district: mate, cotton, snuff, sugarcane, cassava, sesame, Paraguayan cedar, soy, potato, alfalfa, citrus, peanuts, oranges, (sweet and sour), sunflower. Despite being a department rich in agricultural production and especially cattle, the dominant feature of it is the marked deficiency in terms of infrastructure and human development. Much of the district's population, or 69.4% is poor and although the rest of the population is not considered poor, the gaps are very marked, the average monthly income per family corresponds to the sum of only 409,151 Guarani, which represents an income per person monthly average of 78,764 Guarani. The population of the District of General Isidoro Resqu√≠n also engages in commercial river fishing.  Education  The educational level of the vast majority of the employed population (more than two-thirds) is very low, less than the first six years of basic instruction. The working population of the department itself lacks a reasonable level of qualification, which conspires against the development of the area. The illiteracy, due to extreme poverty, which makes it difficult to send their children to school, particularly affects women. The indigenous bias also has access to primary education, albeit with little notice. In the area the town has Mennonite schools Jesuit and Dominican. For the tertiary level and / or University, it has a specialized school, which is the \\" St. Vincent Agricultural School \\" Language  Predominant language Guarani that approximately 80% of the people speak, and the Spanish-Guarani (yopar√†) is spoken by 20% of the remaining population.

It lies mostly within the townland of Treanrevagh (Trian Riabhach) on the N63 national primary road. The town has a population of approximately 800, and has a number of shops and small businesses. There are four schools located in the town, St. Mary's National School, Holy Rosary College, Col√°iste an Chreag√°in and the Franciscan Brothers Agricultural College.Franciscan Brothers Agricultural College Points of interest around the town include the Bellew Estate and woodlands, a small lake, the old forge and the Catholic church. The Bellew Estate was once the home of the Grattan-Bellew family, who were Galway parliamentarians during the 18th and 19th centuries. The estate demesne is now a wooded area of forest walks and picnic areas. The village bridge has a milestone inserted in the middle of its parapet. Franciscan Brothers The Franciscan Brothers came to Mountbellew from Milltown, Dublin, in 1818. The Bellew family invited them and gave them resources of land and a house to get established. The Brothers ran a free primary school until 1884. In 1875 they opened a secondary school (boarding) and in 1898 a special department in the school was set up to prepare students for Teacher Training Colleges. The Brothers changed from secondary education to agricultural education in 1904 and the Franciscan Brothers‚Äô Agricultural College was founded. This was the first agricultural college in Ireland. The Department of Agriculture supported the college from the start. In 1986, the college partnered with a predecessor of Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT). This cooperation between the two colleges resulted in the setting up of what is now known as the Higher Certificate in Business Studies (Agribusiness). Sport and clubs Mountbellew's sporting societies include Mountbellew Moylough GAA club which plays both hurling and Gaelic football. The club colours are black and amber and play in Mountbellew/Moylough GAA grounds. The senior football team have won four Galway Senior Football Championships, in 1964, 1965, 1974, and 1986. The Mountbellew/Moylough Game Preservative Association was founded in approximately 1963 with the objective of preserving game in the parish. They hold clay pigeon shoots and vermin shoots. A monument to the famous racehorse Bobbyjo can be seen in the town centre. He won the Irish and English grand nationals. The River Shiven is nearby, which supports fly fishing for brown trout. The town also has a 18-hole golf course. Mountbellew is also home to the Malthouse Players, a small drama group. The Malthouse Players typically stage two productions each year and partake annually in national competitions. The group on two occasions won the All-Ireland one-act drama finals.

History The company was formed in 1979 as BL Systems Limited (BLSL) through a merger of the computer departments of various automotive manufacturing companies brought together under the British Leyland (BL) umbrella. John Leighfield became the chairman of the new company, which, in addition to providing the computer resources and telecommunications services for the BL companies, gradually started to provide similar services for other outside companies. The company's headquarters were established in Redditch and Coventry. BL Systems pioneered many services, including the establishment of Europe's first microwave communications network in the late 1970s and launched Comet (originally a US product) that in 1981 was Britain's first commercial electronic mail service. In 1984 the company's name was changed to ISTEL. The new company name was said to have been chosen by Leighfield randomly by combining pairs of syllables that sounded vaguely related to systems, telecommunications, or technology until he hit upon one he liked the sound of. By 1986 it was widely understood among staff to be an acronym for \\"In Systems The Established Leader\\", some also noting that \\"Information Systems and TELecommunications\\" fitted quite nicely. In addition, the similarity with the name of a microchip manufacturer did not go unnoticed. The more waggish staff were known to say that the acronym stood for \\"Information Screwed, Twisted and Eventually Lost\\" or \\"I Stand To Earn Less\\". In June 1987, Rover Group (to which British Leyland had been renamed in 1986) sold ISTEL, in a management buyout, to a consortium of its management and employees, and investors, led by John Leighfield, for ¬£35 million. In October 1989, ISTEL was sold to AT&T; and was renamed AT&T; Istel. Latterly it was documented that in 1997 AT&T; quietly dropped the Istel name putting its finance, commerce, travel, and healthcare divisions up for sale. Customers included Citibank, Delta Air Lines, Barclays Bank, Texaco, British Oxygen, Boots and Post Office Ltd.

It is a conventional parasol-wing monoplane with fixed tailwheel undercarriage and a single open cockpit. The design was inspired by the Heath Parasol. Development In response to the 1973 oil crisis, the EAA launched \\"Project Econoplane\\" to develop an aircraft with high fuel economy that would therefore be affordable for its members to operate. The Pober Pixie was the result, with a Volkswagen air-cooled engine of 1835 cc and a fuel consumption of 3 to 3.5 US Gal (11 to 13 L) per hour. Plans were completed in January 1974 and the prototype flew in late July, in time for the EAA Annual Convention that year. After the convention, the prototype was returned to the workshop for modifications, including installation of a Limbach SL 1700 EA engine and Rehm 5330 two-blade fixed-pitch propeller, details of which were incorporated into the plans. Design The Pixie fuselage is fabicated from welded 4130 steel tube, while the wings are made from Sitka spruce covered with Stits Poly-fiber fabric. Recommended engines include Volkswagen or the Continental A65. The design includes full-span ailerons that give it a high roll rate with minimal adverse yaw. Aircraft Spruce and Specialty says of the design: Operational history By March 2017, 27 examples had been registered in the United States with the Federal Aviation Administration and six with Transport Canada. Variants ;Pober Pixie II :Paul Poberezny developed some drawings and started design and partial welding of a fuselage for a two-seat model. Michael Hoye of Heath Texas purchased the project in 1989, continued the design, and over a period of ten years completed building a single scratch built example of a tandem two-seat Pixie in 2000. This aircraft won an \\"outstanding workmanship\\" award at Airventure 2001 and was featured as the cover story by noted author Budd Davisson in the January 2002 issue of Sport Aviation magazine.

National Archaeological Museum, Athens. The sanctuary of Apollo Maleatas () is located on a low hill on Mount Kynortion, east of the sanctuary of Asklepios at Epidaurus. At the peak of the hill was a small Early Helladic settlement, which was never built on in later periods. At the beginning of the Late Bronze Age, an open-air altar was used where animals were sacrificed and votives deposited in the ash. Dedications include votive bronze double axes, bronze swords, and clay animal figurines. There is evidence for cult activity in the Geometric period. Most of the structures on the site belong to the 4th century BC or to the 2nd century AD, when there was a major building campaign paid for by Sextus Iulius Maior Antoninus Pythodorus, an aristocrat from Nysa, Anatolia and a Roman senator. Pausanias (2.2.7) reports that \\"everything about the sanctuary of Maleatas, including the cistern in which the holy water is collected, is also a gift of Antoninus to the Epidaurians\\", and describes the temple: :\\"[By Epidauros, Argolis there is] mountain called Kynortion; on the latter is a sanctuary of Apollon Maleatos. The sanctuary itself is an ancient one, but among the things [the Roman senator] Antoninos made for the Epidaurians are various appurtenances for the sanctuary of [Apollon] Maleatos, including a reservoir into which the rain-water collects for their use.\\"Pausanias, Description of Greece 2. 27. 7 The temple could not have been in functioned to a later date than the 4th or 5th century, when all pagan shrines were closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire. Remains on the site include Roman baths, an underground cistern, a Roman fountain, a small Doric temple of Apollo (4th century BC, hexastyle prostyle), an altar, a shrine of the muses, living quarters for the sanctuary staff, a Roman gateway, and a stoa (late 4th century BC).

Clemmer (February 23, 1965, Alamosa, Colorado) is an analytical chemist and the Distinguished Professor and Robert and Marjorie Mann Chair of Chemistry at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana, where he leads the Clemmer Group. Clemmer develops new scientific instruments for ion mobility mass spectrometry (IMS/MS), including the first instrument for nested ion- mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometry. He has received a number of awards, including the Biemann Medal in 2006 \\"for his pioneering contributions to the integration of ion mobility separations with a variety of mass spectrometry technologies.\\"  Early life and education  Clemmer was born on February 23, 1965, to Ed Clemmer, an artist, and his wife MaryAnn, a teacher, of Alamosa, Colorado. He attended Adams State College, where he originally majored in music, before changing to science. He received his B.S. in chemistry with honors in 1987. He then attended the University of Utah, receiving his Ph.D. in physical chemistry in 1992. His thesis advisor was Peter B. Armentrout, with whom he studied transition metal ions in gaseous reactions. Career During 1992‚Äì1993, Clemmer was a postdoctoral fellow in Japan, supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Fellowship at the Himeji Institute of Technology. He worked with Kenji Honma on electron transfer mechanisms and reactions of excited-state metal atoms and gaseous molecules. From 1993 to 1995, Clemmer was a postdoctoral research associate at Northwestern University, where he worked with Martin F. Jarrold, studying protein folding and protein conformation in the gas phase, using techniques such as Ion- mobility spectrometry. In 1995, Clemmer joined the Department of Chemistry at Indiana University. He served as chair of the Chemistry Department from 2002 to 2006. He is a full professor, and holds the Robert and Marjorie Mann Chair of Chemistry, to which he was named in 2002. He has published more than 230 papers. Among those who have influenced him, he includes Michael T. Bowers, Jesse L. Beauchamp, R. Graham Cooks, Scott A. McLuckey, Fred McLafferty, Evan R. Williams, Joseph A. Loo, Vicki Wysocki, and Julie A. Leary. His graduate students have included Ren√£ A. S. Robinson, Stephen Valentine, Cherokee Hoaglund-Hyzer, and Catherine Srebalus Barnes.  Research  Drift tube for ion mobility spectrometry Clemmer is particularly interested in studying the structural characterization and conformational dynamics of complex low- symmetry systems. Clemmer develops scientific instruments and methods for the examination of biomolecular structure and complex biomolecular mixtures in the gas phase using ion-mobility spectrometry. Ion mobility methods separate ions into different groups based on their ability to move through an electrically- charged buffer gas. This enables complex mixtures to be differentiated in ways that could not be achieved by mass spectrometry alone. Even minute amounts of compounds can be distinguished and differentially examined according to characteristics such as size, shape and charge as well as mass. Clemmer has helped to establish ion mobility as both a powerful tool and a field of research through his \\"thorough studies\\" and \\"revolutionary instrumental methods\\". In early work, Clemmer and Jarrold used long drift tubes with nonclustering gas atmospheres to increase the resolving power of ion-mobility spectrometry. Clemmer's work on gas-phase separation methods for ion mobility- mass spectrometry (IM-MS) and their application to the structural analysis of intact proteins is considered a \\"particularly important milestone\\" in the application of IM-MS to the examination of biomolecular structures. Clemmer and his colleagues have developed at least a dozen different configurations combining modular components for ion-mobility with mass spectrometry instruments. These include combining ion mobility with Time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF). They also developed the first instrument for nested ion- mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Such equipment allows researchers to learn more about both the structures and the conformational dynamics of systems. Clemmer has identified fundamental relationships between charge states and structures, and has shown that a single charge state can exist in more than one conformation in gaseous states. Such techniques can be used for the study of both proteins and peptides. In early work, Clemmer showed that multiple conformations of the hemeprotein cytochrome c could be differentiated based on their mobilities. In addition, the mobility of different chiral isomers was related to their protein folding. More recent techniques enable researchers to track transitions in the conformations of macromolecular ions during the gas phase. A short pulse of ions is introduced into a drift tube by electrospray ionization. Structures separate based on differences in their mobilities. By exposing specific states to energizing collisions, new structures can be established and tracked through different conformational changes. Changes in conformation during the gas-phase data can then be mapped back to the original populations of structures. In this way, researchers can understand the possible pathways between structures. Understanding how protein folding occurs in three-dimensional molecules is one of biology's enduring problems. Proteins with different shapes often have very different biological activity and medical usefulness. Clemmer's work has applications in the life sciences for understanding the conformation of structures in large protein complexes, profiling the plasma proteome, examining the role of proteins and protein folding in neurodegenerative diseases, identifying possible cancer- related markers in blood, urine, or saliva, and increasing the efficiency of drug-discovery. Ion mobility-mass spectrometry techniques also allow the measurement and correlation of a wide variety of different characteristics simultaneously in a single analysis. Researchers can use these techniques to examine complex biological samples for lipidomics, proteomics, glycomics, and metabolomics information. Companies Clemmer is a co-founder of Beyond Genomics, a systems biology company, and the founder of Predictive Physiology and Medicine, a biotechnology company specializing in personalized medicine. Hobbies In addition to playing several instruments, Clemmer enjoys running marathons.  Awards and honors  * 2018, John B. Fenn Distinguished Contribution, shared with Martin F.

History Typical Garhwal riflemen (Estaire La Bass√©e Road, France). Photographer- H. D. Girdwood. (13875264813) The regiment was first raised in 1887 as the Aligarh Levy but was disbanded after disgracing itself at the Rawalpindi Review in 1888. In 1891, the 39th (The Garhwali) Regiment of Bengal Infantry was formed from the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Gurkha Rifles. In 1892, they were given the title of \\"Rifles\\". A second battalion was raised in 1901, making the regiment the only two battalion regiment in the Indian Army, except for the Gurkhas. During World War I both battalions were assigned to the Garhwal Brigade, which formed part of the 7th (Meerut) Division. Initially they were sent to Europe and in the early part of the war, suffered heavy casualties on the Western Front. The regiment was then sent to the Middle East take part in the Mesopotamia Campaign. Two more battalions were raised during the war. The regiment was next in action during the Waziristan campaign 1919‚Äì1920. In 1921, the regiment was renamed as the \\"39th Royal Garhwal Rifles\\". During this time, the Indian government reorganized the structure of its infantry regiments, moving from single battalion regiments to multi- battalion regiments. In 1922, the 39th RGR was the only non-Gurkha Indian infantry regiment to remain intact and not be amalgamated. They were subsequently renumbered the 18th Royal Garhwal Rifles, consisting of three active battalions. The existing 4th Battalion was retitled the 10th Training Battalion.

Its prize projects are an object-relational mapper (ORM) and the database abstraction layer it is built on top of. One of Doctrine's key features is the option to write database queries in Doctrine Query Language (DQL), an object-oriented dialect of SQL. Usage demonstration Entities in Doctrine 2 are lightweight PHP Objects that contain persistable properties. A persistable property is an instance variable of the entity that is saved into and retrieved from the database by Doctrine‚Äôs data mapping capabilities via the Entity Manager - an implementation of the data mapper pattern: $user = new User(); $user->name = \\"john2\\"; $user->password = \\"doe\\"; $entityManager->persist($user); $entityManager->flush(); echo \\"The user with id $user->id has been saved.\\"; Doctrine 1.x follows the active record pattern for working with data, where a class corresponds with a database table. For instance, if a programmer wanted to create a new \\"User\\" object in a database, they would no longer need to write SQL queries, but instead could use the following PHP code: $user = new User(); $user->name = \\"john\\"; $user->password = \\"doe\\"; $user->save(); echo \\"The user with id $user->id has been saved.\\"; Features Overview of Doctrine One feature of Doctrine is the low level of configuration that is needed to start a project. Doctrine can generate object classes from an existing database, and the programmer can then specify relations and add custom functionality to the generated classes. There is no need to generate or maintain complex XML database schemas, as seen in many other frameworks. Another key feature of Doctrine is the ability to optionally write database queries in an OO (object oriented) SQL dialect called DQL (Doctrine Query Language) inspired by Hibernate's HQL. Alternately, the class ( in Doctrine 1.x) allows one to construct queries through a fluent interface. These interfaces provide developers with powerful alternatives to SQL which maintain flexibility and still allow for switching of database back-ends, without requiring any code duplication. Writing queries explicitly however is not always necessary, as Doctrine performs joins and fetches related objects automatically. Small projects can be easily constructed without writing queries. Other notable features of Doctrine are: *support for hooks (methods which can validate or modify database input and output) and event listeners to structure business-related logic; *column aggregation inheritance (similar objects can be stored in one database table, with one type-column specifying the subtype of the particular object - the correct subclass is always returned when a query is done); *a caching framework, making use of several backends such as memcached, SQLite or APC; *ACID transactions; *database migrations; *a \\"compile\\" function to combine many PHP files of the framework into one, to avoid the performance hit usually incurred by including the many PHP files of a framework. History Doctrine was started by Konsta Vesterinen, also known as zYne-. The project's initial commit was made on April 13, 2006. As the project became more mature, the adoption began to pick up. Before long, the community was active and development was receiving regular contributions, among others from the Google Summer of Code project. Doctrine 1.0.0 was released on September 1, 2008.Doctrine 1.0.0 released The first stable version of Doctrine 2.0 was released on December 22, 2010, after 2.5 years of dedicated development starting in early 2008.Doctrine 2 First Stable Release Influences Doctrine has been influenced by dozens of projects and many different people. The largest influences have been the Java ORM Hibernate and ActiveRecord from Ruby on Rails. Both of these ORM solutions have implemented a fully featured solution in the Java and Ruby languages. The purpose of the Doctrine project is to build an equally powerful solution for the PHP language for high-load websites that have to maintain a constant flow of visitors. Doctrine ORM can be used to improve the performance of such websites. Community *There is an active IRC channel where users and developers of Doctrine commonly associate.

In normal pregnancies, the umbilical cord inserts into the middle of the placental mass and is completely encased by the amniotic sac. The vessels are hence normally protected by Wharton's jelly, which prevents rupture during pregnancy and labor. In velamentous cord insertion, the vessels of the umbilical cord are improperly inserted in the chorioamniotic membrane, and hence the vessels traverse between the amnion and the chorion towards the placenta. Without Wharton's jelly protecting the vessels, the exposed vessels are susceptible to compression and rupture. The exact cause of velamentous cord insertion is unknown, although risk factors include nulliparity, the use of assisted reproductive technology, maternal obesity, and pregnancy with other placental anomalies. Velamentous cord insertion is often diagnosed using an abdominal ultrasound. This is most successful in the second trimester, however Color Doppler ultrasound or transvaginal ultrasoundcan be used in difficult cases, such as when the placenta is located posteriorly. If the woman is diagnosed with velamentous cord insertion, the pregnancy is closely monitored, especially as velamentous cord insertion is a strong risk factor for vasa previa, where the exposed vessels cross the cervix and are at high risk of rupture when during membrane rupture in early labor. Management strategies for velamentous cord insertion also involve determining the presence of vasa previa. Velamentous cord insertion impacts fetal development during pregnancy by impairing the development of the placenta and modifying the efficiency of placental function. This can manifest in a range of adverse perinatal outcomes, such as fetal growth restriction, placental abruption, abnormal fetal heart rate patterns, and fetal death. Velamentous cord insertion affects between 0.1%-1.8% of pregnancies, though its incidence increases ten-fold in multiple pregnancies. Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms of velamentous cord insertion during pregnancy include blood vessel compression, decrease in blood supply to the fetus, and impaired growth and development of the fetus. Blood tests taken in the second trimester may reveal increased levels of serum human chorionic gonadotropin and reduced levels of alpha-fetoprotein. The mother may also experience vaginal bleeding, particularly in the third trimester. Women with velamentous cord insertion may not experience any symptoms throughout pregnancy. During delivery, there may be slow or abnormal fetal heart rate patterns and there may be excessive bleeding or hemorrhage, particularly if the fetal vessels rupture. Pathophysiology The exact mechanisms leading to insertion of the umbilical cord in the fetal membranes are unknown, although they are likely to occur in the first trimester. One theory is that velamentous cord insertion may arise from the process of placental trophotropism, which is the phenomenon where the placenta migrates towards areas which have better blood flow with advancing gestation. The placenta grows in regions with better blood supply and portions atrophy in regions of poor blood flow. This process of atrophy may result in the exposure of umbilical blood vessels, causing marginal or peripheral placental insertion to evolve to velamentous insertion over time. Placentas with velamentous cord insertion have a lower vessel density. As the growth of the fetus is dependent on the organization, mass, and nutrient-transfer capacity of the placenta, fetal development is hence hindered in velamentous cord insertion. This can lead to fetal malformations and low birth weight. The umbilical vessels may also be longer compared to normal, particularly when the site of velamentous cord insertion is in the lower uterine section as the extension of the uterine isthmus as pregnancy advances causes vessel elongation. This results in increased vascular resistance, which impedes nutrient transfer to the fetus. The umbilical vessels experience increased pressure and compression as they are not protected by Wharton's jelly. This can cause decreased or acute cessation of blood flow, decreased cardiac output, and pulmonary complications in the newborn. The elongated, exposed vessels in lower velamentous cord insertion cases are more readily compressed by the fetus, hence there is an even greater risk of non-reassuring fetal heart rate pattern and emergency caesarean section. The growth-restricting impacts of placental insufficiency resulting from velamentous cord insertion can also augment the effects of increased pressure to the umbilical vessels. Normally in the second half of pregnancy, one-third of fetal cardiac output is directed towards the placenta. This fraction is reduced to around one-fifth in the last few weeks of pregnancy, while the remaining umbilical blood is recirculated in the fetal body, corresponding with decreased fetal reserves of oxygen. In pregnancies with growth restriction, the fraction of fetal cardiac output distributed to the placenta decreases, further lowering fetal reserves. This can result in increased risk of caesarean delivery, fetal hypoxia, and perinatal death in pregnancies with velamentous cord insertion. Damage to the umbilical cord vessels can occur when the amniotic membranes are ruptured, particularly in the case of vasa previa, potentially leading to fetal exsanguination. If the umbilical vessels are positioned such that their rupture is likely during labor, an elective operative birth at 35-36 weeks gestation may be planned, and corticosteroids may be administered in order to assist with fetal lung maturation. Overall, velamentous cord insertion doubles the risk of both preterm birth and acute caesarean section. =Risk factors= The following have been identified as risk factors for velamentous cord insertion: *Nulliparity *Prior termination *History of infertility *The use of assisted reproductive technology *Multiple gestation *Maternal smoking *Maternal asthma *Maternal obesity *Chronic hypertension *Type 1 diabetes *Gestational diabetes *Placental anomalies, including low-lying placenta, bilobed placenta, placenta with accessory lobe/s *Previous pregnancy with abnormal cord insertion *Having an umbilical cord with a single umbilical artery *Advanced maternal age Diagnosis Abdominal ultrasound can be used to visualize the insertion site of the umbilical cord. Overall, visualization is most successful in the second trimester, however routine ultrasound examination in the second trimester may not detect velamentous cord insertion if the condition develops after the remodelling of the placenta as gestation advances. Visualization becomes increasingly difficult in the third trimester as the fetus may obscure the insertion site. The umbilical cord and its insertion site may be obscured by the fetus, such as in posterior placenta or in low-lying placenta, or may be difficult to visualise due to conditions such as maternal obesity. In these cases, the use of Color Doppler ultrasound or transvaginal ultrasound can enhance the visualization of the umbilical cord, and are able to diagnose velamentous cord insertion at 18-20 weeks. Management If velamentous cord insertion is diagnosed, fetal growth is assessed every four weeks using ultrasound beginning at 28 weeks. If intrauterine growth restriction is observed, the umbilical cord is also assessed for signs of compression. Non- stress tests may be performed twice a week to ensure adequate blood flow to the fetus. The amniotic fluid may be frequently assessed for high levels of inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 which can indicate intra-amniotic inflammation. Upon diagnosis of velamentous cord insertion, transvaginal ultrasound with Color Doppler may also be performed to determine whether any of the exposed vessels are within two centimeters of the internal cervical os. If such vessels are identified, vasa previa may be present and cervical length is measured every week to determine the risk of premature rupture of membranes. Women diagnosed with velamentous cord insertion may also receive counselling about the condition, its risks, and potential courses of action, including preterm delivery or caesarean delivery. The newborn may be delivered via normal vagina labor if there are no signs of fetal distress. Fetal heart rate is continuously monitored for slow or abnormal heart rate patterns which may indicate fetal distress during labor. If the exposed blood vessels are near the cervix or are at risk of rupturing, the newborn may be delivered via caesarean section as early as 35 weeks gestation. Complications =Maternal= *Vasa previa *Rupture of the vessels and membranes *Small placenta *Low arterial cord pH *Vascular thrombosis *Intrapartum bleeding *Umbilical cord avulsion *Need for caesarean delivery, curettage, manual extraction of the placenta *Placental abruption *Postpartum hemorrhage =Fetal= *Prematurity *Abnormal heart rate patterns *Low birth weight *Newborn/s small for gestational age *Low Apgar score *Fetal hypoxia *Pulmonary complications *Fetal malformations *Fetal bleeding *Death In twins, one or both of the fetuses may have velamentous cord insertion, which can lead to birth-weight discordance, where one twin weighs significantly more at birth than the other, and selective fetal growth restriction. These complications particularly arise in the case of monochorionic twins, where identical twins share the same placenta. Epidemiology Velamentous cord insertion occurs in between 0.1%-1.8% of all pregnancies, and is eight to ten times more frequent in multiple pregnancies. This risk is doubled in the case of monochorionic twins, and tripled in the case of fetal growth restriction. It is thought that sex may be a determinant of abnormal cord insertions, however there is conflicting evidence as to whether male or female fetuses are linked to greater risk of velamentous cord insertion.

In their own language \\"Latgawa\\" means \\"those living in the uplands,\\" though they were also known as the Walumskni by the neighboring Klamath tribe. They are close relatives of the Takelma (Dagelma) (\\"(Those) Along the River\\"), which were also known as Lowland or River Takelma. The Latgawa were often called Upland Takelma. History The Latgawa were located in the upper Rogue River valley eastward to the former Table Rock Indian Reservation and Bear Creek and in the neighborhood of Jacksonville, Oregon. Together with other tribes along the Rogue River, they were grouped as the Rogue River Tribe, but after the Rogue River Wars in 1856, bands of the Rogue River were split between the Siletz Indian Reservation or the Grand Ronde Indian Reservation far to the north of the tribe's traditional lands. The Latgawa were one of two peoples who spoke the Takelma language. The Takelma lived mainly on the east side of the Klamath and Coast Mountains in the middle Rogue River area around Grants Pass, Oregon; and the Latgawa in the upper Rogue River area around Applegate, Jacksonville, Talent, Medford, Eagle Point, Butte Falls, Shady Cove, Trail, and extending beyond Prospect and Union up to Crater Lake. =Pre-European contact days= The Latgawa relied on hunting, gathering, and fishing for their subsistence. Latgawa dwellings were small brush shelters for warm months and constructed of sugar pine boards for cold months. They adorned their garments with Dentalium shell, and skin art was practiced regularly. They also bore cultural traits from California, and valued obsidian and Shasta basket hats. During the winters, extended family bands resided in semi-permanent villages at lower elevations often situated at the meeting of major streams, where the spring steelhead runs would provide a welcome supply of fish. From late spring through early fall, they typically spent much time in the nearby uplands and mountains, following game and harvesting plant foods as the snow melted from higher elevations. By autumn, hunters and gatherers regrouped with village elders and others along the lower-elevation streams to intercept the fall salmon run and prepare for another winter. =Contact with European settlers= With the arrival of the European settlers in the 1850s, the Latgawa and Takelma began to lose their homeland. Like their neighbors, the Latgawa resisted encroachment on their lands and became embroiled in the bloody Rogue Wars of the 1850s. Rogue Valley Indians were killed or captured, but some escaped. The U.S. Army exiled the remaining Takelma and Latgawa to the Grand Ronde Reservation many miles to the north, where they arrived both overland and by sea. An 1853 treaty established the Table Rock Reservation in order to throw open the entire Bear Creek and Rogue Valley to white settlement. In the end, from 1855 to 1856, a final Indian War raged from one end of the Rogue Valley to the other. The natives were again compelled to move from Table Rock to the Grande Ronde and Siletz reservations. Bibliography * Beckham, Stephen Dow. (1996).

Charles Kullman (January 13, 1903February 8, 1983), originally Charles Kullmann, was an American tenor who enjoyed a wide-ranging career, both in Europe and America.  Life and career  Charles Kullman was born in New Haven, Connecticut, and began performing in church choir at age eight. He attended Yale University, studying medicine. However, after graduating in 1924, he returned to his first interest, music, believing he could succeed in making a career as a singer. He was accepted at the Juilliard School on a scholarship where he studied with Anna E. Schoen-Ren√©.Juillard Archives After completing three years of study there, he won another scholarship, this one affording him the opportunity to study at the American University in Fontainebleau, France, with Thomas Salignac. Upon returning to America, he taught voice for a while at Smith College, then joined Vladimir Rosing's touring American Opera Company and began singing leading roles. Two years later, Kullman returned to Europe. An associate brought his name to the attention of conductor Otto Klemperer, which led to his engagement at the Kroll Theater in Berlin, where he made his debut on February 24, 1931, as Pinkerton in Madama Butterfly. A year later, Kullman made his debut at the Berlin Staatsoper, where he became a favorite with the public. During his time there, he worked with Germany's leading conductors, including Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler, Erich Kleiber and Leo Blech. 1934 saw Kullman making his debut at the Vienna State Opera, and the Royal Opera House in London. The following year saw his triumphant debut at the Salzburg Festival, as Florestan in Fidelio, conducted by Arturo Toscanini. His Walther in Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg, in 1936, again with Toscanini, won him further praise. He is heard at this time in the live recording of Das Lied von der Erde, with Kerstin Thorborg, under Bruno Walter, from the Vienna Musikverein (also 1936). On December 8, 1939, he changed the spelling of his name from Kullmann to Kullman. After having sung widely in Europe, Kullman returned to America for his debut at the Metropolitan Opera on December 19, 1935, in the title role of Faust. A live recording can be heard of him in this time, singing Alfredo in La traviata, opposite Bidu Say√£o and Leonard Warren in 1943, under Cesare Sordero. In 1947 he appeared in the film Song of Scheherazade as a singing ship's doctor and friend of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. The film was an imaginary episode in the composer's life. Kullman was billed as \\"Charles Kullmann\\". In 25 seasons at the Met, his roles included Don Jos√© in Carmen, Pinkerton, Walther, Ottavio in Don Giovanni, Avito in L'amore dei tre re, and Eisenstein in Die Fledermaus. He later took on character roles such as Shuisky in Boris Godunov and Goro in Madama Butterfly. Essentially a lyric tenor with an unforced freshness, Kullman had enough steel and authority to successfully undertake weightier roles, ranging to Tannh√§user and Parsifal. In later years he taught voice both at Indiana University (1956‚Äì1971) and Curtis Institute of Music (1970‚Äì1971). Charles Kullman died in his native New Haven, Connecticut, aged 80.

Her long life spanned nearly ninety-four years. Early life Earl of Bute Stuart was one of the six daughters of John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute (1713‚Äì1792), who at the time of her birth in 1757 was the closest friend of the future King George III. Her mother was Mary Stuart, Countess of Bute (1718‚Äì1794). Lord and Lady Bute also had five sons. Although Bute was Scottish, he spent much of his time at his grand London house in Berkeley Square.Graham, Harry, [Jocelyn Henry C. Graham], A Group of Scottish Women (New York, Duffield & Co., 1908) Chapter XVIII online at Lady Louisa Stuart (1757‚Äì1851) at electricscotland.com (accessed 20 February 2008) In 1762, he bought the estate of Luton Hoo in Bedfordshire. George III came to the throne in 1760, and in 1762 his friend Bute became prime minister. As a statesman, Bute was massively unpopular with the English, for a variety of reasons. He was a Scot, a Royal favourite, and a handsome man who was lampooned for his vanity, and was constantly the butt of biting political satire, scandal, and gossip. This included frequent allegations of an affair with Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha (1719‚Äì1772), the widow of Frederick, Prince of Wales. Bute's ministry fell in 1763, when his daughter Louisa was five years old, and Bute retired from public life to Luton Hoo and thereafter devoted himself to botany, horticulture and other country pursuits. Stuart's mother, the Countess of Bute, was herself the daughter of the famous writer and traveller Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (1689‚Äì1762). By the time she was ten, Stuart had begun to follow in the footsteps of her writer grandmother. She had begun a French novel and had also started planning a Roman play. She felt threatened by her brothers, who teased her about her learning.Miller, Karl, Stuart, Lady Louisa (1757‚Äì1851), writer in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004 & online edition, January 2006 (subscription required) accessed 29 February 2008 With her mother, the young Lady Louisa Stuart attended the balls, routs and soir√©es of London society, but she also followed the literature of the day and corresponded with friends. She had great powers of observation from an early age, and a manuscript notebook survives in which she describes her circle. Fanny Burney often met Lady Bute and her daughter Lady Louisa and described Lady Bute as \\"forbidding to strangers\\", but entertaining and lively among friends. Burney writes of mother and daughter on one occasion:Diary and Letters of Madame D‚ÄôArblay, vol. III, p. 463 On another occasion, in 1786, Burney found both Stuart and her mother at the house of Mary Delany after a return from the spa town of Bath and writes that they were: Brothers and sisters Louisa's own brothers included John Stuart, 1st Marquess of Bute (1744‚Äì1814), a Tory Member of Parliament from 1766 to 1776, later a Privy Councillor and a Fellow of the Royal Society; The Hon. Sir Charles Stuart (1753‚Äì1801), a soldier who saw active service in the American Revolutionary War and the Napoleonic Wars and rose to the rank of lieutenant-general; The Most Rev. and Hon. William Stuart (1755‚Äì1822), a clergyman who became Archbishop of Armagh, and James Archibald Stuart (1747‚Äì1818), another soldier who raised the 92nd Regiment of Foot in 1779.Cokayne, George Edward, The Complete Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom Extant, Extinct, or Dormant Her sisters were Lady Mary Stuart (c. 1741 ‚Äì 1824), who married James Lowther, later the 1st Earl of Lonsdale; Lady Anne Stuart (born c. 1745), who married Lord Warkworth, later the 2nd Duke of Northumberland; Lady Jane Stuart (c. 1748 ‚Äì 1828), who married George Macartney, later the first Earl Macartney; and Lady Caroline Stuart (before 1763‚Äì1813), who married The Hon. John Dawson, later first Earl of Portarlington. Disappointment in love William Medows In 1770, at the age of thirteen, Lady Louisa fell in love with her second cousin, William Medows (1738‚Äì1813), the son of Philip Medows of Nottinghamshire, Deputy Ranger of Richmond Park, and of Lady Frances Pierrepont, who like Louisa's mother was a granddaughter of Evelyn Pierrepont, 1st Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull. Medows was then a forty-one-year-old lieutenant-colonel of the 5th Regiment of Foot, and Lord Bute considered him unsuitable and put a stop to it. Lady Louisa was bitterly disappointed. She wrote of Medows:Gleanings from an Old Portfolio (Correspondence of Lady Louisa Stuart), ed. Mrs. Godfrey Clark (privately printed, 1898), volume I, p. 301 Later the same year, Medows married another lady, Frances Augusta Hammerton, and went on to become a Lieutenant-General, a Knight of the Bath, and Governor-General of Madras. (accessed 25 February 2008) Stuart was not a beautiful woman. Fanny Burney wrote of her in 1786:The Diary and Letters of Madame D'Arblay (1842), ed. Charlotte Barrett, volume III, p. 237 Lady Louisa Stuart's family home at Luton Hoo in Bedfordshire, as it was in her day Louisa Stuart does not seem to have fallen in love again, but she had at least two other pursuers. Her next was Henry Dundas (1742‚Äì1811), member of parliament for Midlothian and Lord Advocate of Scotland, later created Viscount Melville. Dundas was a gallant and good-looking man who had been married but was legally separated from his wife. His devotion worried the Bute family, but it turned out to be brief and merely amused Lady Louisa. Her last serious suitor was John Charles Villiers (1757‚Äì1838). He was the second son of Thomas Villiers, 1st Earl of Clarendon, and for a time overwhelmed Stuart with his admiration. Her parents encouraged the match, and she was tempted, but she finally decided that a \\"love match without any love is but a bad business\\". As a result, she never married. In 1791, Villiers married his cousin Maria Eleanor Forbes, a daughter of Admiral John Forbes, and in old age he inherited the family's titles and estates from his older brother Thomas Villiers, 2nd Earl of Clarendon (1753‚Äì1824), who never married. (accessed 25 February 2008) When the Earl of Strafford (1722‚Äì1791) was widowed in 1785,Anne, Countess of Strafford (c. 1715‚Äì1785) online at artsmia.org (accessed 5 March 2008) society gossip quickly linked his name with Stuart's, leading Lady Diana Beauclerk to remark \\"So Lady Louisa Stuart is going to marry her great-grandfather, is she?\\"Memoirs of the Argylls in the Journal of Lady Mary Coke, vol. 1, p. xlix However, Stuart looked on Strafford merely as an elderly uncle, and not as a suitor, and he for his part did nothing to promote such an alliance. Stuart later became a close friend of the novelist and poet Sir Walter Scott (1771‚Äì1832), a friendship that lasted from the 1790s until Scott's death in 1832. Scott regularly sent Stuart his work for her opinion, describing her as the best critic of his acquaintance. Work For fear of losing caste as a lady of quality, Stuart had no wish to see anything she had written published under her name, and it was not until 1895, more than forty years after her death, that this happened.The Cambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes (1907‚Äì21), Volume XI: The Period of the French Revolution XV The Bluestockings, ¬ß3 Mrs Montagu online at bartleby.com (accessed 2 March 2008) Lockhart's Life of Scott (1837‚Äì1838)Lockhart, John Gibson, Life of Sir Walter Scott (7 volumes, 1837‚Äì1838) had contained several of Sir Walter Scott's letters to Stuart. In a letter to his publisher Robert Cadell, Scott writes \\"I trust you have received the printed sheets of Lady Louisa Stuart, but for your life mention [not] her name.\\"Parker, W. M., The Origin of Scott's Nigel in The Modern Language Review, Vol. 34, No. 4 (October 1939), pp. 535‚Äì540 Much of Stuart's writing is still in the form of unpublished memoirs and letters, mostly addressed to women, but interest in her as an observer of her times began to increase towards the end of the nineteenth century. Between 1895 and 1898, Mrs Godfrey Clark edited and published three volumes of Stuart's work called Gleanings from an Old Portfolio (Correspondence of Lady Louisa Stuart), and the Hon. James A. Home followed these with Lady Louisa Stuart: Selections from her Manuscripts (New York & London: Harper Brothers, 1899) and with two volumes of Letters of Lady Louisa Stuart to Miss Louisa Clinton, published in Edinburgh in 1901 and 1903.Looser, op. cit., p. 60 Stuart's memoir of Lady Mary Coke, written in 1827, represents Coke as a virtuous woman suffering from a brutal husband, but also as a tragedy queen subject to paranoia. Her essay Biographical Anecdotes of Lady M. W. Montagu (published anonymously as an introduction to the 1837 edition of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's Letters and Works) focusses largely on the work and political position of Lady Mary's husband Edward Wortley Montagu, giving Stuart the chance to air her own views on Wortley Montagu, Walpole, Harley, Halifax, and the Whigs and Tories generally, demonstrating her own loyalty to the side of the Tories.Looser, Devoney, British Women Writers and the Writing of History, 1670‚Äì1820 (JHU Press, 2000, ) p. 64 Devoney Looser considers that Stuart (whom she calls \\"the socially correct octogenarian\\")Looser, op. cit., p. 66 was troubled by her grandmother's focus on sexual intrigues and says that Stuart did not see Lady Mary's Account of the Court of George I at his Accession as history.Looser, op. cit., pp. 65‚Äì67 Conscious of Walter Scott's, Alexander Pope's and Samuel Johnson's poetry, Stuart wrote verses of her own, including fables and a ballad about cannibal brothers and what happens to an unfortunate woman who has married for money. Stuart was not a Bluestocking, and although her writing has a dash of malicious humour, it lacks their mutual admiration. She had a great lady's fine scorn for Elizabeth Montagu's habit of welcoming into society those born outside its pale, and she ridiculed \\"college geniuses with nothing but a book in their pockets\\". She wrote \\"The only blue stocking meetings which I myself ever attended were those at Mrs Walsingham's and Mrs Montagu's. To frequent the latter, however, was to drink at the fountain-head\\".Gleanings from an Old Portfolio (Correspondence of Lady Louisa Stuart), ed. Mrs Godfrey Clark (privately printed, 1898), vol. III, p. 61 Jill Rubenstein describes Stuart as \\"Tory to the bone, never having forgiven the pain inflicted on her father by the scurrilous personal attacks of Wilkes and others\\" and compares her politics to those of Sir Walter Scott, \\"a principled and consistent conservatism\\".Looser, op. cit., Note 13 on p. 215 Professor Karl Miller, in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, praises Stuart's \\"magnificent pieces of writing\\". He also reports on her inconsistencies. On the matter of the emancipation of women, she was both for and against it, and while she favoured the old order in politics and had an aversion to the mob, she also admired \\"unadorned human worth\\". Miller calls Stuart \\"the least-known, but by no means the least, of the good writers of her long lifetime\\". Later life In her later years, Stuart took a house in London at 108, Gloucester Place, Marylebone, and from there she walked in Regent's Park. At home, she would sit with her books, and although something of a recluse, on occasion she was also highly sociable. She destroyed many of her manuscripts, but continued to write letters and to talk and to visit great houses. A few months before her death, she was sketched by Sir George Hayter, and died at home in London on 4 August 1851.

It has extensive cultivation fields and streams nearby like the Capi'ivary, Poromoc√≥, Mansisovy, Santa Mar√≠a and others. Name The name comes from its elevate position with a little downhill to the Paran√° river, from German hoch 'high' and Au(e) 'floodplain'. History The city was founded on March 14, 1900 by Carlos Reverchon, Guillermo Closs, Ambrosio Scholler and Esteban Scholler, helped by German colonists. Founder Wilhelm (Guillermo) Closs, who was of German descent, was born on 31 October 1841 in Baumschneis, Brazil (today's Dois Irm√£os). Closs established a place called \\"Serra Pelada\\" in the state of R√≠o Grande do Sul. Later, he decided to move to Paraguay, where he met Hohenau's future co-founder Carlos Reverchon. Together, they drafted plans for a massive wave of German immigrants to settle in the region. Aided by the Austrian consul to Paraguay, they successfully persuaded the government to allow for the construction of a colony. So, by a decree dated September 12, 1898, the Paraguayan government gave Guillermo Closs and Carlos Reverchon a share of 16 square leagues in the then Alto Paran√°, Encarnaci√≥n Department. On March 14, 1900, the first settlers arrived from Encarnaci√≥n In August 1900, the arrival of 8 more families (a total of 55 people ), set the stage for mass migration to the colony. Some of these first families were the Dresslers, Kuschels, Fritzes, Jachows, as well as others. These families faced many problems, such as disease, scarcity and lack of communication, which were gradually overcome. The town's status was elevated to an official district in 1944. In the 1930s and '40s, the colony began to attract many non-Germans, such as Poles, Ukrainians and Russians, and to a lesser degree Belgians and French. Later, in 1958, a large wave of Japanese arrived. These settlers then went on to found the district of La Paz. Geography The city has 220 square kilometers. Limits to the north and the east with the Obligado district, to the south with the Trinidad district, and to the west to the Jes√∫s, La Paz and San Pedro del Paran√° districts. Is on a zone rich in hydrographic resources with the Paran√° river and the Capi'ivary stream. =Climate= The climate is sub-tropical, ideal for the agriculture, with temperatures oscillating from 3 and 4 ¬∞C in winter to 37 and 38 ¬∞C in summer. =Demography= Hohenau has a total population of 7,987 inhabitants. Economy The inhabitants dedicate themselves to agriculture, specifically to the cultivation of soy, cotton, corn, manioc, yerba mate, tung, sorgo, citric, bean, peanut and watermelon, and stock-breeding: cows, pigs and birds. There are also some small industries: flour mills, yerba mate mills, wineries, brick factories, bakeries, saw-mills, carpentry shops and starch factories. According to the General Directorate of Statistics, Polls and Census, the Hohenau district has the second-highest living standard in Paraguay, the first being the capital, Asunci√≥n. =Tourism= An important touristic attraction is the Alto Paran√° Hunting and Fishing Club where the traditional Fishing of Dorado takes place. Among the other attractions this city offers are the German and Japanese colonies, where the visitor can admire the architectural characteristics, the typical foods and the cultivated fields. Hohenau can be reached by the Ruta Sexta Doctor Juan Le√≥n Mallorqu√≠n, a road that crosses the urban center of the city and connects it with the cities of Encarnaci√≥n and Ciudad del Este. A network of local roads connects Hohenau with other places in the surrounding area. Institutions The city has a dance school, culinary arts academy, tailoring academy, barber academy and other institutions that teaches computer science and typewriting. The sanitary institutions in the city are: SOS Aldea de Ni√±os, founded August 21, 1971, in a terrain donated by the German Association of Hohenau and actually has 17 buildings housing 160 kids; the Mother and Child Hospital, the SOS Hospital, that counts with 40 beds and 2500 monthly consults; and the Adventist Clinic, that started its medical assistance service to the district and the department in 1963.

Research All mainstream editions of chant books (Vatican, Solesmes, etc.) are known to contain a large number of errors. Comparative studies have been undertaken in which related groups of the earlier rhythmic unheightened neumatic manuscripts are set in large tables of comparison which is juxtaposed with a similar table of later melodic linear notations. Description Research by Dom. Jean Claire in the field of modality has shown that the third and eighth modes have had their dominants raised from B to C. In mode III is E authentic; the dominant a fifth above is B, which in many chants is raised to C in official editions. Not only are many chants in mode III and VIII in need of melodic restitution, there are errors in all other modes. The Munsterschwarzach-Group (Godehard Joppich, Stefan Klockner et al.)(publishers of the Beitr√§ge zur Gregorianik) have been issuing their own melodic restitutions, as has Anton Stingl, and Geert Maassen with his Fluxus.notation. Whereas some of the researchers are hoping to establish an Urtext edition, others have given this up as unrealistic and prefer not to mix manuscripts into 'editorial soup' but to respect them as local variants in their own right.

Ross (19 April 1854 ‚Äì 24 March 1916) is known as the third Commandant of the Coast Guard, although he was never formally appointed to that position. Joining the United States Revenue Cutter Service (known today as the United States Coast Guard) in 1877, he graduated from the Revenue Cutter Service School of Instruction's first class in 1879. He held a variety of appointments during the late 19th century before being appointed Captain-Commandant of the service in 1905. In this capacity he commanded a number of cutters on the United States Gulf Coast and was responsible for moving the School of Instruction to Fort Trumbull, Connecticut. He was a relation of Brevet Brigadier General Samuel Ross (1822-1880), who commanded the 20th Connecticut Infantry during the American Civil War. Early life and education A native of Cleveland, Ohio, Ross was appointed as a cadet to the Revenue Cutter Service School of Instruction on 4 January 1877 after successfully completing an entrance examination.Noble, p 62 He was among ten candidates out of nineteen to pass the required examination and was one of eight cadets that were told to report aboard the USRC Dobbin at Baltimore, Maryland. Dobbin left on a summer training cruise on 24 May and Ross was detached from the cutter awaiting orders on 13 July because of a rules infraction. A week later, Ross was reprimanded for \\"licentious and scandalous conduct\\" by Captain John Henriques, head of the school. Records do not specify what his offense was, although Ross apparently arrived in New Bedford, Massachusetts, on 15 October with the rest of the class to start cadet academic training. The training cutter Dobbin was replaced by the newly commissioned during August 1878 and Ross along with the rest of the cadet class were the first cadet class to serve aboard Chase. After the first year, he received the most demerits in his class and came very close to being expelled.King, pp 157‚Äì158 The school conducted a two-year course at the time and Ross graduated on 2 July 1879, after which he was commissioned as a third lieutenant. He remained assigned to Chase until being reassigned to on 29 May 1882.Record of Movements, p 179 Early career His promotion to third lieutenant was made permanent on 28 January 1880. On 29 May 1882 Ross was assigned to Colfax, homeported at Wilmington, North Carolina. He was promoted to second lieutenant on 20 October 1884. On 28 February 1885 he departed Colfax on leave while awaiting his next assignment.Record of Movements, pp 186‚Äì190 On 2 June 1885, Ross reported aboard USRC George M. Bibb at Oswego, New York and was assigned to her until she was decommissioned for the winter season. He departed Bibb on 4 December 1885. Ross was briefly assigned to Bibb again during the period of 15 May to 30 July 1886.Record of Movements, pp 156‚Äì158 After he was promoted to first lieutenant on 18 January 1896, he served on the USRC Grant, which was then serving on the Bering Sea Patrol.Strobridge and Noble, p 164 Ross was serving as executive officer aboard the USRC Levi Woodbury when the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War was declared in April 1898,Record of Movements, p 491 but he was soon transferred to the , a converted passenger liner, formerly known as City of New York, that the U.S. Navy used as a supply carrier and troopship.

M. Shaw. He became the first School of Instruction graduate to become the Captain-Commandant of the Revenue Cutter Service. Soon after his appointment, Ross was directed by Secretary Shaw to take personal charge of six Revenue Service cutters that were being used to quarantine vessels arriving at the ports along the Gulf Coast from the threat of a yellow fever epidemic and defuse tensions caused by the disruption of shipping schedules. Ross established a temporary headquarters at Gulfport, Mississippi, and established patrols for the six cutters and seven chartered vessels under his command, and remained on-scene until 23 October when the crisis had passed.King, pp 131‚Äì132 Despite his School of Instruction experience, Ross later used his position as commandant to procure funding for a permanent home for the Revenue Cutter Service School of Instruction. After USRC Salmon P. Chase was decommissioned, Ross moved the school to Curtis Bay, Maryland, and, in 1910, after the facilities there proved to be too small, to Fort Trumbull, Connecticut, a surplus U.S. Army fort located away from the Academy's current home in New London, Connecticut to which the Academy was moved in 1932. Ross retired from active service at his own request because of ill health on 30 April 1911 and was succeeded as commandant by Senior Captain Ellsworth P.

The show was the last musical for which Coward wrote both the book and music, although he wrote the music for one last \\"book\\" musical in 1963. The story centres on brash, bold American divorcee Mimi Paragon, working as a hostess on a British cruise ship. The musical ran on Broadway (1961) and in the West End (1962) and has been revived since. Background Elaine Stritch started in the show in a \\"relatively minor role and was only promoted over the title and given virtually all the best songs when it was reckoned that the leading lady...although excellent, was rather too operatic for a musical comedy.\\" During out-of-town tryouts in Boston, Coward was \\"unsure about the dramatic talents\\" of one of the leads, opera singer Jean Fenn. \\"They were, after all, engaged for their voices and...it is madness to expect two singers to play subtle 'Noel Coward' love scenes with the right values and sing at the same time.\\" Joe Layton suggested \\"What would happen if ...we just eliminated [Fenn's] role and gave everything to Stritch? ...The show was very old- fashioned, and the thing that was working was Elaine Stritch...every time she went on stage [she] was a sensation. The reconstructed 'Sail Away'...opened in New York on 3 October.\\" According to Ben Brantley, \\"Coward wrote in his diary that Ms. Stritch sang 'so movingly that I almost cried.' He went on to say about making her the show's star: 'There is no doubt about it. I made the right decision.'\\" Productions Sail Away had out-of-town tryouts for three weeks each in Boston and Philadelphia. The show opened on Broadway 3 October 1961, at the Broadhurst Theatre and closed on 24 February 1962 after 167 performances. Directed by Coward, Joe Layton choreographed, with scenic design by Oliver Smith, costumes by Helene Pons and Oliver Smith, and lighting by Peggy Clark. The original Broadway cast starred Elaine Stritch as Mimi Paragon, James Hurst as John Van Mier, and Margalo Gillmore as Mrs. Van Mier. The show was then staged at the Savoy Theatre in the West End in 1962, where it ran for 252 performances, directed by Coward. The original London cast starred Stritch and David Holliday as John, and featured Grover Dale, Sheila Forbes, Edith Day, John Hewer, Stella Moray and Tony Adams. The musical was then produced, with Coward's personal directorial attention, in Melbourne in 1963, starring Maggie Fitzgibbon. It was revived at the Rhoda McGaw Theatre in Woking, England in 1998. Gerald Gutierrez directed a November 1999 staged concert version in the Weill Recital Hall of Carnegie Hall, starring Stritch. A concert version played in July 2008 at Sadler's Wells' Lilian Baylis Theatre, directed by Ian Marshall Fisher in the Lost Musicals series, starring Penny Fuller as Mimi, Vivienne Martin as Mrs. Van Mier, and Rupert Young as John. Not only did Coward write the book, music and lyrics, and also direct the show, he even designed the show poster. Some of its songs are well known, including \\"Why Do the Wrong People Travel?\\" \\"Useless, Useful Phrases\\", \\"The Customer's Always Right\\" and the title song. The song \\"Sail Away\\" was first used by Coward in his 1950 musical Ace of Clubs. Plot Mimi Paragon is the American cruise director on board the British luxury cruise ship Coronia, bound for a Mediterranean cruise. Mimi is middle-aged and divorced. The younger Johnny Van Mier romances Mimi. During the course of their ship romance, they have to deal with annoying and troublesome passengers such as the Sweeneys.

In an effort to turn their personal tragedy into a cause for public good, in 1993 Dona and Chuck and a small group of friends founded CRY (Crime Responsibility and Youth). CRY was dedicated to strengthening the justice system and helping youth at risk in the hopes of preventing future senseless acts of violence. When her husband, Chuck, was later elected to Parliament, Dona remained active in Victim's Rights organizations and Criminal Justice reform groups. She worked for Canada Post for ten years; and has also been active in her community, coaching girls softball and sitting on the Surrey Girls Softball Board of Directors. Dona is an active member of the Surrey Mayor's Crime Task Force and she sits on the development committee for the SOS Children's Village BC.  Legal controversy  In an interview after the budget vote, Chuck Cadman said he voted in favour of the budget simply because he was obeying the wishes of constituents who did not want to face another election a year after giving the minority Liberals their shaky mandate. Dona Cadman alleged that her husband told her that prior to the vote, two Conservative Party officials offered her husband a million- dollar life insurance policy in exchange for his vote to bring down the Liberal government in May 2005. These allegations first became publicly known in early 2008 in connection with the scheduled March 15, 2008 publication of Like A Rock: The Chuck Cadman Story, by Vancouver journalist Tom Zytaruk. Under section 119 of the Criminal Code, it is illegal to bribe an MP. Accordingly, Opposition Liberal party Intergovernmental Affairs critic Dominic LeBlanc asked the RCMP in February 2008 to investigate this allegation, that the Conservatives had offered Mr. Cadman a million-dollar life insurance policy in exchange for his support on the budget vote. In May 2008, the RCMP announced that there was no evidence to support charges. Prime Minister Stephen Harper responded to the Liberal repetition of these allegations with a $2.5 million libel lawsuit, alleging defamation. Tom Zytaruk claimed to have an unedited audio tape of an interview with Stephen Harper where Harper acknowledged that Chuck Cadman had been approached by two Tories. Zytaruk then sold copies of the tape, through his publisher, for $500. In March 2008, Cadman herself stated publicly she believed Harper. According to her, Harper \\"looked me straight in the eyes and told me he had no knowledge of an insurance policy offer. I knew he was telling me the truth; I could see it in his eyes.\\" On the very same day Harper issues a notice of libel against the Liberal leader and his party in preparation of the libel suit that he would pursue 10 days later. (Unlike other democracies, Canada still allows political libel suits). Based on copies of the tape, in early June 2008, the Conservatives introduced two affidavits from experts indicating the tape had been edited. James Moore, Conservative MP for Port Moody‚ÄîWestwood‚ÄîPort Coquitlam told a news conference June 4, 2008 that two audio specialists retained by the Conservative Party had determined that the tape in which PM Stephen Harper apparently confirms financial considerations had been offered to Chuck Cadman included \\"the insertion of a fabricated sound bite,\\". This was later refuted by the court appointed FBI expert who examined the original tape, and found the tape was not altered. In early July 2008, Dona Cadman swore an affidavit that challenged some of Tom Zytaruk's assertions, though in a previous affidavit she maintains her \\"recollection of her husband's words to the effect that two Conservative operatives... offered him a million dollar life insurance policy in exchange for his vote,\\" notes Liberal MP LeBlanc. Her new affidavit denies specific public accounts by Zytaruk of how he came to meet Harper that day, and he professed himself \\"extremely surprised, disappointed and deeply distressed\\" by her statement. Member of Parliament Following her husband's death, Cadman endorsed New Democratic Party candidate Penny Priddy in the 2006 election. Priddy had been friendly with the Cadmans for many years, despite their sharp political differences. Priddy went on to win, but retired after only one term. Cadman, who had by this time reconciled with the Conservatives, ran for the seat and won it narrowly, becoming a government backbencher. She was narrowly defeated in 2011 by New Democrat Jasbir Sandhu. In the 2015 Canadian federal election, Cadman endorsed Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party of Canada, as well as the Liberals' candidate for Surrey Centre, Randeep Sarai.

The name means \\"Fort Cobblestones\\" in English. It was built in 1797 on Ballast Point as the first defensive fortifications for San Diego Bay. It was involved in the Battle of San Diego, a naval battle between the fort and an American trading vessel. The site is registered as California Historical Landmark #69. Structure and location Ballast Point and surrounding area, February 2000 Fort Guijarros was made out of adobe and it had ten cannons mounted in gun emplacements. At least two of the guns survive. One of them, \\"El Jupiter\\", can be seen at Fort Stockton. \\"El Capitan\\" is located in Old Town Plaza in San Diego. The fort was built in 1797 as the first defensive fortifications for San Diego harbor. It commanded the entrance to San Diego Bay from a rise at the base of Ballast Point at Point Loma. In 1796 the Spanish named the point \\"Punta de los Guijarros\\", which means \\"point of the cobblestones\\". The fort's English name is \\"Fort Cobblestones\\". The point derived the name Ballast Point from the fact that the early Yankee skippers would have stones gathered from Ballast Point to serve as ballast in their ships during their returns around Cape Horn to their home town, Boston. History View from Point Loma looking East over Fort Rosecrans and Ballast Point. The ruins of Fort Guijarros would be to the right of the largest gun battery of Fort Rosecrans, Battery Wilkeson. The ten guns of the fort were fired in action only twice. The first time was in 1803 during the Battle of San Diego. The Spanish had detained the American brig Lelia Byrd in San Diego Harbor for smuggling otter skins. The ship's crew overpowered their Spanish captors and were headed out of the harbor when the guns of the fort sought to prevent her escape. Fire from the Lelia Byrd's guns drove the fort's gunners to seek cover. The fort again fired on an American smuggler in 1828. This time, the fort was under Mexican control and the vessel was the Franklin. In 1846, during the Mexican American War, the American ship USS Cyane landed American Marines at nearby La Playa. The marines took abandoned guns from Fort Guijarros and used them to lay siege to Old Town San Diego. In 1873 the United States Army took over Ballast Point and built gun batteries for the defense of San Diego as Fort Rosecrans. These installations were maintained through World War I and World War II. A lighthouse known as the Ballast Point Light was built on Ballast Point in 1890 and survived until 1957. In 1962 the United States Navy built a submarine base on Ballast Point as home port for the Pacific Fleet's nuclear attack submarines.

This right-libertarian approach emerges from a synthesis of neo- Calvinist systematic and biblical theology.Hermeneutical principles appear at . Theology pertinent to libertarian Christianity appears in , \\"Theological Glossary\\" and \\"Maxims of the Global Covenant\\". As libertarians, they believe that all secular governments exist to protect the natural rights of individuals, and only to protect natural rights; and they believe that natural rights are necessarily defined in terms of private property, at least in the legal and political arena. While acknowledging a nominal distinction between their legal-political thought and the rest of their theology, they are suspicious of any attempt to exclude other areas of Reformed dogmatics from political discourse and wish to underscore the need for Biblically derived, Protestant theories of law and political organization. Libertarian Christians seek to distinguish themselves from both secular libertarians and non-Reformed Christian libertarians. They claim to be distinct from secular libertarians by deriving a formally voluntaryist legal and political philosophy strictly from the text of the Bible, rather than from secular sources or non-Calvinistic philosophy, and from Christian libertarians by deriving a Bible-based legal regime according to biblical hermeneutics at odds with those used by other libertarians professing Christian faith.For instance, compare and Despite their claim to be methodologically distinct from secular libertarians and Christian libertarians, libertarian Christians readily acknowledge large areas of basic agreement with other types of libertarians in regard to legal and political concerns, and they readily work in concert with people from these other schools. More specifically, they make common cause with right- libertarians and market anarchists who generally espouse private property and natural rights. These include Rothbardian anarcho-capitalists, Nozickian minarchists, Hoppean paleolibertarians, and more mainstream Christian libertarians.  Theology  = Distinction from metaphysical libertarianism = Reformed Libertarian Christians affirm absolute predestination.See , Theological Glossary/#predestination. They also believe in \\"free will\\" only to the extent that free will is a necessary prerequisite to moral accountability. Following the Westminster Confession of Faith, Chapter III,See , \\"Of God's Eternal Decree\\". they believe that \\"God from all eternity did ... freely and unchangeably ordain whatsoever comes to pass; yet so as thereby neither is God the author of sin; nor is violence offered to the will of the creatures, nor is the liberty or contingency of second causes taken away, but rather established.\\"See , #GodsDecrees. By believing in predestination, libertarian Christians believe in determinism to the extent that determinism is congruent with their view of predestination. Since metaphysical libertarianism patently rejects the precept that God has \\"from all eternity ... ordain[ed] whatsoever comes to pass,\\" Reformed libertarian Christians patently reject metaphysical libertarianism as humanistic. On the other hand, Reformed libertarian Christians usually so reject so-called hard determinism due to the fact that its rejection of free will eliminates the possibility of moral accountability and just punishment. = Distinction from Christian libertarianism = Libertarian Christianity distinguishes itself from Christian libertarianism by having beliefs about law and government that derive from a distinct framework for interpreting the Bible, i.e., from a different set of biblical hermeneutics.The biblical hermeneutics used by libertarian Christians can be found at . The biblical hermeneutics used by Christian libertarians depends upon what kind of Christian libertarian is at hand. The difference between Christian libertarianism and libertarian Christianity starts in their respective ideological foundations. Libertarian Christianity has its foundation in biblical theology, and sees its libertarian political / legal philosophy as an outgrowth of that theology. On the other hand, Christian libertarianism, at its most systematic, is seen by libertarian Christians as being more ad hoc and less systematic. Libertarian Christians believe that Christian libertarianism, at its most systematic, is a blend of secular libertarianism and Christian dominionism / reconstructionism / theonomy. In contrast to Christian libertarianism, libertarian Christianity claims to be a systematic derivation of libertarian principles from the Bible, and libertarian Christians do not recognize any ideological debt to secular libertarianism. Instead, they believe that their libertarianism is a seamless outgrowth of their biblical theology. The only theological system commonly cited by Christian libertarians is theonomic reconstructionism. Libertarian Christianity is compatible with a few of the basic tenets of theonomic reconstructionism. For example, libertarian Christians and theonomic reconstructionists agree about Abraham Kuyper's basic approach to life. As Ligon Duncan puts it, \\"Kuyper argued for an philosophy of life resting upon God alone as the epistemological foundation. 'There is not an inch in the whole of temporal life which Christ, as Lord of all men, does not say, \\"Mine,\\"' said Kuyper.\\"See . But libertarian Christianity has a major split with theonomic reconstructionism with regard to the way that Bible scholars in these two schools go about discerning the biblical prescription of human law, that is, the biblical prescription of positive law. Reconstructionists, and Christian libertarians who claim to be reconstructionists, assume (along with many Covenant Theologians) that such positive law can be discovered by deducing it directly from Bible-based moral law.For instance, shows that libertarian Christianity discourages deducing human law directly from moral law, while shows that theonomic reconstructionists recommend deducing human law from moral law. Christian libertarians who are not reconstructionistsbecause they do not have explicit interpretational guidelines aimed at discovering the biblical prescription of human laware more likely to use a more ad hoc approach to Scripture that is less rational and less systematic. Some Christian libertarians might not use the Bible as authority at all, as a source of human law. Libertarian Christians agree with reconstructionists with regard to the manner in which Bible-based moral law is discovered, specifically, with the analogy-of-faith interpretive principle. But libertarian Christians disagree with theonomic reconstructionism / Christian libertarianism in regards to the proper hermeneutics to use to discover the biblical prescription of human law. Christian libertarians deduce the biblical prescription of human law directly from their beliefs about Bible-based moral law. In contrast, libertarian Christians believe that the biblical prescription of human law cannot be deduced directly from biblical moral law.See proof at , #Relation between Natural Law and Human Law. They believe that instead, the task of discovering the biblical prescription of human law demands a strictly chronological hermeneutic that has very little dependence upon prior discoveries about the Bible's moral law. The most obvious point where results of these two hermeneutical agendas conflict is in regard to so-called victimless crimes. For example, comparison of the relative attitudes towards victimless crimes held by prototypical secular libertarian, Murray Rothbard, and the prototypicial Christian libertarian, Andrew Sandlin, shows that secular libertarianism and Christian libertarianism are not particularly compatible. From the libertarian Christian's perspective, the comparison shows that Christian libertarianism's attempted amalgamation of secular libertarianism lacks rational integrity. Libertarian Christians believe this lack of rational integrity in the Christian libertarian legal philosophy is a symptom of Christian libertarianism's erroneous hermeneutics. Rothbard wrote: > [T]the most important argument for Prohibition was the undoubted fact that > people commit significantly more crimes, more acts of negligence on the > highways, when under the influence of alcohol than when cold sober. So why > not prohibit alcohol ... I submit that there is only one why not, and this > should be no news to libertarians who presumably believe in inalienable > individual rights: namely, that no one has the right to coerce anyone not > himself directly engaged in an overt act of aggression against rights. Any > loosening of this criterion, to include coercion against remote \\"risks,\\" is > to sanction impermissible aggression against the rights of others., p. 231, > Chapter 29, \\"Robert Nozick and the Immaculate Conception of the State\\". Libertarian Christians believe that this prototypical secular libertarian argument applies with equal logic to all so-called victimless crimes. According to Rothbard, secular libertarianism gives no place to the state for punishment of victimless crimes. The same cannot be said for Christian libertarianism according to Sandlin, who wrote: > [T]he state must punish murder (Ex. 21:12), theft (Ex. 22:1-4), idolatry > (Ex. 22:20), and other sins that the Scriptures explicitly requires it to > punish. Since we may deduce from Scripture that abortion is murder (see Ex. > 21:22, 23), that copyright infringement is theft, and that the public > worship of the Earth by New Age advocates is idolatry, the state may > suppress these crimes.. In a secular state, according to secular libertarianism, idolatry is a victimless crime (or rather, shouldn't be a crime at all), and to punish it would itself be a crime. Biblical standards of morality call for the proscription of libertine behavior, such as drug addition, alcoholism, prostitution, gambling, and idol worship. Theonomic Reconstructionists and Christian libertarians generally believe that wherever such behavior is made morally repugnant by biblical standards of morality, the secular government is rightly authorized to punish practitioners. Libertarian Christians believe that in regard to victimless crimes, the secular libertarian position is more rational and more consistent with the Bible than the Christian libertarian position. In contrast to Christian libertarians, libertarian Christians believe that behaviors that violate biblical standards of morality, but are nevertheless victimless crimes, are rightly punished only within the ambit of the visible Church, and should be dealt with otherwise through free market processes. Libertarian Christians believe that secular governments are never authorized by Scripture to punish such immorality unless there is undeniable proof that a contract has been broken or real damage to another person's property (including this other person's ownership of his/her physical body) can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt., Theological Glossary/#subject matter jurisdiction. Libertarian Christians also have a major difference with theonomic Christian libertarians with regard to apologetics. While theonomic Christian libertarians adhere to presuppositional apologetics, libertarian Christians do not. Use of presuppositional apologetics makes the development of Bible-based natural law rationally impossible. In libertarian Christianity, the existence of Bible-based natural law is a prerequisite to the discovery of Bible-based natural rights, because such natural rights are a subset of such natural law. Along with a Bible-based concept of the social contract, Bible- based natural law and Bible-based natural rights are the core of the libertarian Christian's Bible-based political and legal philosophy. But theonomic Christian libertarians believe in neither natural law nor social contract theory.Compare and , #Relation between Natural Law and Human Law. Libertarian Christians believe that it is important to understand natural rights within the overall context established by the interpretive framework from which they derive, for two overriding reasons: (a) They believe that maintaining the rational linkage of their political and legal theology to the Bible is important for the sake of distinguishing their libertarianism from libertinism. (b) They believe that maintaining the rational linkage of their political and legal theology to the Bible is important for the sake of distinguishing libertarian Christianity from any breed of libertarianism that presumes to authorize secular governments to punish victimless crimes. = Distinction from Thomism = Libertarian Christians believe that it's wrong to believe that just because they believe some of the doctrines taught by Thomas Aquinas, that they must be Thomists, and therefore Roman Catholics. They claim on the contrary to believe in Calvinistic soteriology and to be adherents to their own unique understanding of covenant theology.See . = Distinction from secular libertarianism = The most prominent difference between Rothbard's brand of Austro-libertarianism‚Äîas espoused in his book, The Ethics of Liberty,‚Äîand libertarian Christianity revolves around his rejection of the social contract theory of government. Libertarian Christians have Bible-based concepts of natural law and the social contract. In contrast, Rothbard believes in natural law, but he does not believe in any viable social contract theory.See , pp. 5-26 (re: natural law) and pp. 147, 232 (re: social contract). In John Locke's Second Treatise on Civil Government,. Locke speaks of people surrendering natural rights in the process of entering a social contract, or more specifically, trading rights for the benefits of participation in the social contract. He indicates that this is a voluntary and consensual process. But Locke fails to show how, once the social contract is established, the offspring of the original contract-makers volunteer into the contract, and thereby perpetuate the consensual nature of the original contract. This is the first of two major problems that Rothbard sees in the social contract. Rothbard recognizes this flaw not only in Locke's philosophy, but also in the organic documents of the United States. The second problem arises by way of Rothbard's commitment to a strict \\"title-transfer\\" theory of contracts.See , Chapter 19, \\"Property Rights and the Theory of Contracts\\". Because of these two problems, Rothbard rejects the social contract theory of government. --- Rather than rejecting the social contract because of these two problems, libertarian Christians use biblical exegesis to solve them. To solve the first problem, libertarian Christianity shows how offspring of the original contract-makers either enter the contract voluntarily and consensually, or do not enter it at all (thereby removing themselves from the social contract's jurisdiction).See ,\\"Article I Section 8 Clause 4\\". To solve the second problem, libertarian Christians hold to a \\"property-interest\\" theory of contracts that allows for the alienation of interests in labor and actions,See , \\"Memorandum of Law: Contract Enforcement, Involuntary Servitude, & the Social Contract\\". even though they agree with Rothbard regarding the inalienability of the human will. The implications of these distinctions are huge, in the view of libertarian Christians, because, in their view, Rothbard's anarcho-capitalism is inherently dysfunctional without a social contract that is understood to have a perpetual existence.  Criticism of libertarian Christianity  Criticism of libertarian Christianity arises out of both criticism of libertarianism in general and out of opposing Christian theologies. Such theologies manifest in supporters of other Christian political movements, such as the Christian left, Christian democracy, Christian socialism, Christian anarchism and Christian communism.

Early years Jackson was possibly born in Camborne and educated at the Camborne School of Mines. Other sources claim he was born in Swansea, Wales while the Manchester Evening News reported in 1900 that he was educated at Llandovery College and he may have served in the Boer War. No records of his birth have been found. Rugby union career A Cornish rugby union player (16 Cornish caps), Jackson played 'forward' for Camborne RFC, Plymouth, Leicester and represented A.F. Harding's Anglo/Welsh British Lions team in their tour to Australia and New Zealand in 1908. Jackson was the Leicester Tigers leading scorer in the 1906‚Äì07 season. He was reputed to be a powerful goal-kicker and was the star of Cornwall's championship-winning side in 1908 when he led the way in the 17‚Äì3 final victory over Durham in front of 17,000 spectators at Redruth R.F.C.'s Recreation Ground. Jackson was suspended and recalled from the 1908 Lions tour of New Zealand, where he was considered the tourists' best forward, to be investigated by the Rugby Football Union for professionalism.

Rugby league career Jackson played rugby league for both Auckland and New Zealand in 1910, captaining Auckland against the touring Great Britain Lions and also playing the country of his birth in the Test match for New Zealand, where he kicked four goals.JACKSON, Frederick Stanley 1910 - Kiwi #47 nzleague.co.nz Later in the 1910 season he was suspended by the Auckland Rugby League for striking an official who had insulted his MƒÅori companion.Coffey, John and Bernie Wood Auckland, 100 years of rugby league, 1909-2009, 2009. . p.37. Later years Jackson married a young Maori woman from Te Araroa, Horowai Henderson. Initially they lived at Hastings with Paraire Tomoana and his wife Kuini, who was a relative of Henderson's. They later moved to Te Araroa on the East Cape where he became a selector for the East Coast Rugby Union. He died in Auckland on 15 April 1957. Jackson had five children, Everard, Mary, Reginald Tutu Taonga Wi Repa, Sydney (Bully) and Irwin. Everard became a noted All Blacks prop. Sydney (Bully) Jackson and Tutu Wi Repa represented the New Zealand MƒÅori rugby union team. Everard's son, Syd, was a prominent MƒÅori activist, trade unionist and leader.

The thirteen chapters of the book are presented as lessons derived from a seminar Badiou gave at the College International de Philosophie between 1998-2001. Badiou's analysis of the 20th century is drawn from his unique encounter with 20th century poetry and theater, literary theory, totalitarianism, and the search for meaningful narratives that are neither logical nor dialectical. He warns against \\"animal humanism\\" and advocates \\"formalized inhumanism\\".Badiou (2007, 178). The search for a method Badiou conceives of the century as a duration and concentrates upon the \\"short century\\" of 75 years, beginning with the wars of 1914-18 (including the Russian Revolution of 1917) and closing with the collapse of the USSR and the end of the Cold War. Badiou agrees with Andr√© Malraux's observation that politics has turned into tragedy in the 20th century and adds that \\"the century was haunted by the idea of creating a new man.\\"Badiou (2007, 8). He suggests the political project enacting that tragedy is driven by profit motives, as well as \\"criminals as anonymous as joint-stock companies.\\"Badiou (2007, 10). The beast Badiou considers the century as conceived in Osip Mandelstam's poem The Age (1923) which depicts the wounded body of a beast. The degree to which the century can be considered as living recalls the vitalism of Henri Bergson, and Badiou contrasts it to Friedrich Nietzsche's concept of the will to power and the √úbermensch. Badiou also compares 19th century's submission to the movement of Hegelian history with the 20th century's effort to confront history face to face. This kind of voluntarism has been marred by horrendous experiences of war. Badiou suggests that such butchery has instilled doubt and nostalgia for historical moments of the past and states that the 20th century sought to fulfill the promises of the 19th century, including Marx's concept of revolution. In Lacanian terms, Badiou indicates that the experience of The Real is always in part the experience of horror.

It was the first large Gothic Revival church built in Alabama. The building was designed by architects Frank Wills and Henry Dudley. History Trinity Episcopal Church was established in 1845, as the second Episcopal congregation in Mobile. Christ Church Cathedral was the first. The cornerstone for the building was placed on April 8, 1853. A yellow fever outbreak swept through the city in that year and the church's register shows that the rector conducted 49 funerals in September 1853. This appears to have delayed construction, but the building was finally completed in 1857. It was located at the corner of St. Anthony and Jackson Streets until it was moved to Dauphin Street in 1945. Hurricane Frederic damaged the building in 1979. It removed a portion of the roofing, broke windows, and damaged the spire. All of this damage was repaired, with steel reinforcement added to the rebuilt spire. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. It was nominated for National Historic Landmark designation, but did not obtain this status due to the building having been moved. The church building was renovated in 2010. On Christmas Day 2012 it suffered major damage from an EF2 tornado that took a path through the city. The main sanctuary lost over a third of its roof, the front gable-end wall of the parish hall collapsed, and other structural damage was caused by the storm. Architecture Trinity Episcopal Church is Gothic Revival, in a Middle Pointed style inspired by 14th century English architecture. The church is built in brick and is an aisled nave-and-chancel structure with a monumental bell tower. This church served to inspire the rector of the Episcopal Church of the Nativity in Huntsville to hire Frank Wills to design a sanctuary for his congregation. The designs for both churches are very similar. and References External links *Trinity Episcopal Church - official website Churches completed in 1857 Towers completed in 1857 National Register of Historic Places in Mobile, Alabama Churches in Mobile, Alabama Episcopal church buildings in Alabama Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Alabama Gothic Revival church buildings in Alabama Towers in Alabama Bell towers in the United States Religious organizations established in 1845 1845 establishments in the United States 19th-century Episcopal church buildings ","title":"Trinity Episcopal Church (Mobile, Alabama)"},{"id":"16060711","text":"Gaetano Preti (born February 28, 1891, date of death unknown) was an Italian gymnast who competed in the 1908 Summer Olympics.

It was published in the December 1982 issue of Shueisha's Fresh Jump magazine on October 23, 1982, and later included in 1988's Akira Toriyama's Manga Theater Vol. 2. Pink was adapted into an anime film in 1990 titled . Story A young girl named Pink makes a living as a mysterious bandit stealing water from the shady Silver Company, which she keeps for herself. Despite the drought, the Silver Company has somehow managed to make a profit by selling a steady supply of water at outrageous prices, thus making them perfect targets for the thief. Due to her early-pubescent physique and her face being concealed behind black goggles, her opponents all assume Pink is a guy. After numerous thefts, the head of the company, Silver, calls the local sheriff Cobalt Blue to apprehend the bandit and bring them to justice. With little information to go by, Blue goes in search of the bandit. He comes across Pink's home, which he finds suspicious, as there is a lush palm tree thriving amidst the drought. So he asks her a few questions, but comes with nothing despite all the evidence around him. Pink is all too willing to answer his questions as she has become smitten by him. Later that night, after having a dream about her and Blue walking together with her parents' umbrella in the rain, Pink comes up with the solution to the drought and heads out to the Silver Company for one last heist. Meanwhile, Cobalt Blue has finally put together that the bandit and Pink are the same person and goes after her. Pink performs a frontal assault on the company, but is quickly overpowered by Silver's forces. Just as they are about to kill her, Cobalt Blue steps in and saves Pink. She quickly tells Blue she is on a mission to rescue Kaminari, and takes Blue to the basement where Kaminari was. It turns out the drought was the result of the Silver Company holding Kaminari prisoner and forcing him to make water for them to sell. With Kaminari free, he proceeds to make up for lost time and produces rain. Unfortunately, he goes overboard and the manga ends with the land being completely flooded. But Pink finally has Blue all to herself in her parents' umbrella, which they're now using as a boat. Anime Theatrical poster for the anime film. Some of the established characters were revamped. Nearly eight years after Pink was first published, Toei Animation produced an anime film adaptation titled Pink: Water Bandit, Rain Bandit. It was shown exclusively as part of Akira Toriyama: The World event at the July 7, 1990 Toei Anime Fair alongside two other Toriyama properties, Kennosuke-sama and Dragon Ball Z: The Tree of Might. The film would also get distributed on home video along with Kennosuke-sama as a double feature on March 8, 1991. Music from the film was released as part of the Akira Toriyama: The World and Pink Songs & BGM albums. Allusions to other works Many have found similarities to other Toriyama stories such as 1981 story Pola & Roid and the 2000 series Sand Land. Pink can also be compared to the early depiction of the Dragon Ball character Yamcha, as both characters are thieves who live in the desert and have companionship with unusual talking creatures.

Competences tested are reading, writing, listening, grammar and vocabulary, while speaking is excluded for technical reasons. DIALANG was designed primarily for European citizens to assess their language abilities in adherence to Europe‚Äôs Common European Framework of Reference ‚Äì CEFR ‚Äì as a basis for determining language proficiency. The CEFR is a widely recognized framework used to describe and measure the language proficiency level of a learner in a particular language. Dialang was funded by the SOCRATES programme and by some 25 institutions, largely universities, throughout the European Union.Alderson, J. Charles., Huhta, Ari (2005). The development of a suite of computer-based diagnosis tests based on the Common European Framework. Language Testing, 22 (3), 301. Dialang is explained in the Appendix C, pages 226-243 of the CEFR official document. Fourteen languages The current version of DIALANG provides tests in Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish, Irish, Icelandic, and Norwegian. It is a web-based project, and the system can be downloaded from its website free of charge. Users must have an Internet connection in order to use the software. DIALANG offers separate test for reading, writing, listening, grammatical structures and vocabulary. DIALANG provides test instructions, controls, help pages, explanations, self- assessment statements, test results, feedback and advice in all 14 languages. These tests enable the users to become aware of their strengths and weaknesses. The tests are offered across a wide range of proficiency levels from beginners to advanced. Due to the limitations of the test design, DIALANG has not yet developed effective methods to test speaking and writing. Users should note that DIALANG uses an indirect approach to assess written tasks: many writing tasks in DIALANG resemble reading, vocabulary or grammar tasks. Users are given the opportunity to write to complete some tasks; however, they may be limited to just a few words. Purpose DIALANG is not intended to be used for certification purposes. It is not designed to certify language proficiency. The purpose of DIALANG is to offer information regarding a test takers strengths and weaknesses in a language. DIALANG suggest that its system will be most valuable to teachers, language teaching institutions, institutions running independent language learning schemes, and in institutions interest in promoting language proficiency among their staff. DIALANG is intended for any foreign language learner. DIALANG can assess language proficiency of those formally trained in language classes and those trained informally. DIALANG suggests that its unique feature of offering test in 14 languages could be particularly suitable to the diverse second language learners in Canada . There are no age restrictions for DIALANG test-takers. Yet, it is important to recognize that the tasks written and designed by DIALANG deal with issues that may not be appealing to young learners. Also, participants whose L1 is not among the 14 languages listed and who are not proficient enough in any of these languages may not be able to understand the instructions or the statements in the self-assessment questionnaire. By simplifying the language of instruction, DIALANG could be made accessible to a wider range of users .

The nearest inhabited town is Elberta, some to the south. A heavily promoted planned community in the 1910s, Mosida was ultimately a failure. History The land was purchased from the Utah State Land Board in 1909 by a group of three men: R. E. Morrison, Joseph Simpson, and J. E. Davis. They planned to divide the land and sell it in tracts for peach orchards. They named their project Mosida, an acronym formed from the first two letters of each of their surnames. Within months they sold out to a group of promoters from Denver, Colorado who incorporated as the Mosida Fruit Lands Company. The company began to improve the property and advertise to prospective investors and buyers. Since the land west of Utah Lake lacks any major streams, they built a pumphouse at the lake's edge, dug irrigation ditches, and installed a series of pumps to water the farmland. A large boarding house was constructed to house up to 250 workers. In 1911 the boarding house filled with workmen from surrounding towns, recruited to clear and plow the land and plant apple and peach seedlings. A steam tractor pulling a massive gang plow was used to break up the soil. By 1912, of land had been plowed, 50,000 fruit trees planted, and of grain harvested. The company built a 25-room luxury hotel which became the town landmark, used to house tourists and prospective investors. Those who came to consider purchasing tracts of land or shares of stock were given a grand tour and a powerful sales pitch about Mosida's natural advantages and bright future. No expense was spared to impress the guests; a fine passenger boat ferried them across the lake to and from Provo. Locals sometimes used the boat as a dance floor for parties. The Mosida Fruit Lands Company soon added more houses, a store, a post office, and even a school. They imported two French cooks to provide their workers the best of meals at the boarding house. The company's salesmanship was effective; by 1913 some 400 people had moved to Mosida and were working the farms and orchards. The new residents quickly found that life in Mosida did not live up to the promotional literature's glowing descriptions. The fruit trees began to die; it transpired that the soil was too salty and mineralized for them. Other crops such as wheat and peanuts did better, but swarms of grasshoppers damaged the surviving crops, especially the alfalfa. Transportation to and from the isolated site was a challenge, and became even harder when the Mosida boat was destroyed in a fire on April 17, 1913. The pumping and irrigation operations also proved more expensive than planned, despite a second pumping plant installed in 1914. The lake level fluctuated widely from year to year, dropping so low in 1915 that the water could no longer be pumped. Individual landowners and the company itself found themselves increasingly in debt, and in 1915 the Mosida Fruit Lands Company was placed under court-ordered receivership. Creditors tried to keep the project going for a few more years, but by 1917 most people had left. The population dropped to 67 by 1920, and with no more water or power available Mosida died. The last resident stayed until 1924. Some ruins of Mosida still stand, including the foundations of the hotel and schoolhouse, and the concrete pumphouse walls.

She is tall and plays as libero. She plays for Eczacƒ±ba≈üƒ± Zentiva since 2003 and wears the number 2. She also played for Ankara Numunespor, ≈ûanlƒ±urfa Gen√ßlikspor. Career \\"I started playing volleyball in elementary school in Samsun at the age of eight\\", is how she describes the start of her career. Her first club team was Ladikspor. After Ladikspor she transferred to Samsun Atakum and DSI Spor before playing for the first division team ≈ûanlƒ±urfa Gen√ßlikspor (2002‚Äì03). Then she signed a contract with Ankara Numunespor. At the beginning of the preparation phase for the European Championships, G√ºlden was chosen (out of a selection of many experienced libero players) as a candidate for the libero position in the national team. To her surprise, and to the amazement of many volleyball authorities, the national team coaches chose her to represent the Turkish colours in the European Championships 2002-03. G√ºlden tried her utmost to deserve this honor. \\"Being a part of the National Team means everything to me. I was very excited as I was just at the beginning of my career and was so afraid of not being successful. My team mates were very understanding and supportive. At the first national camp there were already two liberos and I did not expect to be chosen for the team. However, when they finally announced my selection, I was extremely excited' she said. During her first international appearance at the 23rd European Championships she demonstrated her defensive strengths with some great actions, thus becoming a very effective weapon and the mascot of the national team of Turkey. At the end of the EC she was declared the best digger of the tournament. Although having lost the final to Poland, it has nevertheless been Turkey‚Äôs biggest success in the history of the European Championships.

Early career  Casson was born 29 April 1943 in Halifax, West Riding of Yorkshire. After leaving school ( St Bede's Grammar Bradford), Casson joined a band called The Cresters as their drummer. The Cresters supported The Beatles on their first tour of Scotland, and worked many major cabaret venues, such as Batley Variety Club, Wakefield Theatre Club, Caesars Palace, The Maltings, where they backed Tammy Wynette on several TV specials. With The Cresters he appeared regularly on TV shows such as Cliff Richard & Friends and gaining an army of fans when the band were selected for a long residency on Granada TV. While on the cabaret circuit Casson not only drummed, but started performing comedy. The comedy gradually became more popular than the music and in 1984, whilst on a family holiday at a Butlins Holiday Camp, his wife entered him into that week's talent contest. He won the contest, which meant a free holiday to appear in the regional finals, which he again won. The grand final was held at the London Palladium and Casson was again the judges choice. Following this, and a winning slot on Hughie Green's Opportunity Knocks, he decided it was time to break from The Cresters, and went on the road as a solo stand-up comedian.

He is best known for designing Lunokhod 1, the first ever planetary rover for space exploration. Early life Kemurdzhian was born to Armenian parents on October 4, 1921 in Vladikavkaz, today the capital of North Ossetia. His father (b. 1898) and mother (b. 1901) were volunteers in the Russian Civil War with the 11th Red Army who happened to be in Vladikavkaz at the time of his birth. His Turkish-Armenian paternal grandparents were from Trebizond who settled in Batumi in the late 19th century. His mother was from Rostov-on-Don. His family settled in Baku, Soviet Azerbaijan when he was 5. He grew up there and considered Baku his hometown. His unskilled parents lived in poor conditions. In 1939 he began working as a Russian announcer at the Azerbaijani radio. In 1940 he enrolled at the Bauman Higher Technical College in Moscow. With the start of the Eastern Front of World War II in 1941, he and other students of the tank department were assigned to repair damaged tanks until the institute was evacuated to Izhevsk. In early 1942 he volunteered to join the Soviet Army. He participated in the battles of Kursk, the Dnieper, and the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive. He served in the 162nd Infantry Division of the NKVD. He rose to the rank of senior lieutenant by the time he was demobilized in 1946. For his services, he was awarded the Order of Courage, Order of the Red Star (1944), Order of the Patriotic War (1945, 1995), Order of the Badge of Honour, and the Medal \\"For Battle Merit\\". Due to the disruption caused by the war, Kemurdzhian graduated from the department of tracked vehicles of the Bauman Higher Technical College in 1951, some 11 years after enrolling. Career In 1951 Kemurdzhian began working at the Leningrad-based All-Union Scientific-Research Institute No. 100 (VNII-100, now known as VNIITransmash), whose \\"primary expertise was building tanks for the Soviet Army.\\" Kemurdzhian's research focused on continuously variable transmission in tracked vehicles. In 1957 he defended his kandidat nauk thesis. From 1959 on Kemurdzhian led research on air-cushion vehicles (hovercraft). Kemurdzhian authored 200 scientific publications (mostly papers, some six monographs) and patented 50 inventions. =Work on lunar rovers= Between 1963 and 1973 Kemurdzhian headed the team assigned to develop the chassis for the Lunokhod programme. His team designed both Lunokhod 1 (1970) and Lunokhod 2 (1973). In 1969 he was named deputy director and chief designer at VNIITransmash. Under his leadership, the institute became a leader of space transport engineering. In 1971 he became Doctor of Technical Sciences after defending his dissertation based on his work on Lunokhod 1. He was named professor in 1977. Kemurdzhian was personally interested in spaceflight and \\"remote-controlled space probes,\\" which was known to Sergei Korolev. In September 1963 Korolev met with VNIITransmash engineers to discuss the possibilities of developing lunar rovers. The design sketches for the first lunar rover were completed by September 1965. Kemurdzhian provided the main report on the possibility of creating the lunar rover. Georgy Babakin, director of OKB Lavochkin, and Kemurdzhian worked closely to design the Ye-8 in 1966. In 1967 a final lunar rover design was reached and a prototype was constructed. Early models were sent to the moon on Luna 11, Luna 12 (1966) and Luna 14 (1968). Lunokhod 1, the finalized version, was designed by Kemurdzhian and Babakin. Kemurdzhian is credited with being the chief designer of the self-propelled chassis of Lunokhod-1. Lunokhod 1 was carried to the moon by Luna 17, which was launched on November 10 and landed on the moon on November 17, 1970. It was the \\"first successful rover to operate beyond Earth\\" and the \\"first self-propelled, crewless vehicle to operate on the moon.\\" It weighted and was long and high. It carried cameras, transmitters and scientific instruments. The remote- controlled robot traveled some in 10 months and sent back some 20,000 photos and 200 panoramas. It also completed over 500 lunar soil tests. =Work on Mars lander vehicle= Prop-M Rover The M71 landers‚ÄîMars 2 and Mars 3‚Äîwhich were launched in 1971, both carried a small walking robot called PrOP-M (–ü—Ä–û–ü-–ú, Pribor otsenti prokhodimosti - Mars, \\"instrument for evaluating cross-country movement\\") developed by Kemurdzian at VNIITransmash. Later years and death In response to the Chernobyl disaster, Kemurdzhian led a team of researchers to develop, in May 1986, the robot STR-1 (–°–¢–†-1) to support the Chernobyl liquidators to investigate and cleanup the area. In Chernobyl he was exposed to excessive radiation and was treated in a Moscow hospital for radiation burns. Kemurdzhian retired in 1998. In 2000 he became a founding member of the St. Petersburg Branch of the Russian Academy of Cosmonautics (StPB RAC). In November 2000 he was the chief speaker at the 30th anniversary of the Lunokhod meeting held at the Tovstonogov Bolshoi Drama Theater. His last public appearance took place in mid-January 2003. A few days later he suffered a hip fracture and was hospitalized. He died in Saint Peteresburg on February 24 or 25, 2003\\\\. He was buried at the Smolensky Armenian cemetery in St. Petersburg. Recognition Kemurdzhian is recognized as the \\"founder of the Russian school of design of planetary rovers.\\" For his work on lunar rovers, Kemurdzhian received the Lenin Prize in 1973. A minor planet discovered on August 26, 1976 by Nikolai Chernykh at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory was named 5933 Kemurdzhian. He was a member of The Planetary Society, the European Geosciences Union, and other learned societies. Documents, photos, and other archival materials on Kemurdzhian are kept at the Russian State Archive of Scientific-Technical Documentation. Malenkov described him as follows: \\"A sharp mind, quick wit, and immediate response in all, including unexpected, situations; professionalism, encyclopedic erudition, commitment and hard work, multiplied by boundless energy; natural qualities of a leader of any assembly of people or experts, gathered by chance or by virtue of production relations; a charming conversationalist, a poet, and a great storyteller...\\"  See also  * List of Russian inventors References ;Notes ;Citations Bibliography  External links * 1921 births 2003 deaths People from Vladikavkaz Armenian inventors Armenian engineers Armenian scientists Russian inventors Russian aerospace engineers Soviet scientists Soviet aerospace engineers 20th-century Russian engineers Soviet space program personnel Armenian academics Bauman Moscow State Technical University alumni Russian Armenians Soviet Armenians 20th-century inventors ","title":"Alexander Kemurdzhian"},{"id":"16061649","text":"I'm Backing Britain campaign badge I'm Backing Britain was a brief patriotic campaign, which flourished in early 1968 and was aimed at boosting the British economy. The campaign started spontaneously when five Surbiton secretaries volunteered to work an extra half-hour each day without pay to boost productivity and urged others to do the same. The invitation received an enormous response and a campaign took off spectacularly; it became a nationwide movement within a week. Trade unions were suspicious of or even opposed to the campaign, as an attempt to extend working hours surreptitiously and to hide inefficiency by management. The campaign received official endorsement by the Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, but it found that being perceived as government-endorsed was double-edged. The Union Flag logo encouraged by the campaign became highly visible on the high streets, and attempts were made to take over the campaign by Robert Maxwell, who wanted to change its focus into an appeal to 'Buy British', but the campaign's own T-shirts were made in Portugal. After a few months without any noticeable effect on individual companies or the economy generally, interest flagged amid much embarrassment about some of the ways in which the campaign had been pursued and supported. It has come to be regarded as an iconic example of a failed attempt to transform British economic prospects. Economic background In 1967, the British economy suffered from several difficulties. Despite tax increases announced in July 1966, the 1967 budget had set the greatest deficit in post-war history of ¬£1,000,000,000.\\"New Thinking At The Treasury\\" (leader column), The Times, 13 April 1967, p. 23. Each month, the Board of Trade published figures of the 'balance of trade' between exports and imports which seemed to show an ever-increasing deficit.A monthly average of a ¬£9m deficit in 1966 and in the first quarter of 1967 increased to ¬£40m in the second quarter, ¬£27m in August, and ¬£52m in September. See Peter Jay, \\"Trade deficit increases to ¬£52m\\", The Times, 13 October 1967, p. 17. The closure of the Suez Canal after the Six-Day War hit exporters, as did an unofficial dock strike, which broke out at the end of September.\\"Dock strikes stop one third of exports\\", The Times, 13 October 1967, p. 17. Having put up the bank rate to 6 percent on 19 October,Keith Payne, \\"6% Bank rate to defend pound\\", The Times, 20 October 1967, p. 19. on 18 November, the government abandoned three years of attempting to maintain the exchange rate and devalued the pound sterling from $2.80 to $2.40. Although it was an economic defeat, devaluation was perceived as an export opportunity that British industry needed to seize. Arising out of devaluation, John Boyd-Carpenter (Conservative Member of Parliament for Kingston-upon-Thames) wrote to The Times in a letter published on 13 December 1967 suggesting, \\"If a number of people, particularly in responsible positions, would set by an example by [sic] sacrificing say the first Saturday of every month and working on that morning without extra pay, profits or overtime, it would give an example to others at home, and show the world that we were in earnest\\". He complained that capital equipment stood idle from Friday afternoon to Monday morning.John Boyd-Carpenter, \\"Why the pound is weak\\" (letter), The Times, 13 December 1967, p. 11. Colt Ventilation and Heating Ltd On 27 December 1967, Fred PriceAndrew Lycett, \\"The famous five: any make as long as it's British\\" (Monday Page), The Times, 4 January 1988, p.15. (Marketing Director of Colt Ventilation and Heating Ltd) sent out a memo headed \\"General progress report\\", which assessed the company's economic prospects. Inspired by Boyd-Carpenter,The Guardian, 2 January 1968, p. 14. he wrote that the balance of payments deficit would disappear overnight if the working population of the United Kingdom worked a five-and-a-half-day week without demanding higher incomes for the extra half day. Price said that Britain would become once more the wealthiest country in the world. The memo was received by five secretaries working in the company's head office in Surbiton, Valerie White, Joan Southwell, Carol Ann Fry, Christine French and Brenda Mumford.\\"Staff vote for unpaid work\\", The Times, 30 December 1967, p. 3. The next morning, they discussed it and Southwell said that she was willing to work an extra half day a week. The others agreed, and White took the initiative of writing a reply, which she gave reference VW/OD GEN. The reply said, \\"What about starting this scheme of a five-and-a-half-day week? Let us be the first company to start the ball rolling\\". After discussing the suggestion with the other members of staff, on 29 December the 240 employees at the head office voted to report for work at 8.30 a.m. instead of 9 a.m. They also made contact with the workers employed at the company's factory in Havant, Hampshire, to encourage them to do the same. Campaign snowballs Before the workers had a chance to work their first extra half hour, their campaign had already begun \\"snowballing fast\\". Over the weekend of 30‚Äì31 December 1967, five other companies had already decided to follow their example, based in Portsmouth, Southend, Bicester and Manchester; others were telephoning to show their interest. The Duke of Edinburgh sent a telegram describing the campaign as \\"the most heartening news I heard in 1967\\" and wishing it success.\\"'Half-hour extra' plan snowballs\\", The Times, 1 January 1968, p. 1. There was a full turnout at 8:30 a.m. on 1 January at the Surbiton offices, and Havant worked their extra half hour at the end of the day.Eric Silver, \\"'Back Britain' drive said to be a gimmick\\", The Guardian, 2 January 1968, p. 1. Working with the company's managing director, Alan O'Hea, the five secretaries began to think up a slogan. After rejecting \\"I'm Behind Britain\\" for having the wrong message, they settled on \\"I'm Backing Britain\\". O'Hea then ordered (from Norprint of Boston, who supplied them free) 100,000 badges featuring a Union Flag with their slogan written across the centre and began writing to 30,000 employers to encourage them. The workers contacted leading political and industrial figures to ask for suggestions as to how others could help. Advertising agency DPBT bought a full-page advert in The Times of 3 January 1968 offering their spare time, free, to make commercials backing the campaign.\\"Valerie, Brenda, Joan, Carol and Christine, we love you.\\" (advertisement), The Times, 3 January 1968, p. 3. All three major political party leaders sent their support, and an all-party press conference promoted the campaign on 5 January.\\"'Back Britain': pace grows\\", The Times, 6 January 1968, p. 3. Not all companies joining the campaign did so by working extra unpaid hours, as some cancelled projected price increases and waived fees. The campaign extended to Wales, where the Welsh language slogan was not a direct translation but instead \\"Rwy'n Bacio Cymru\\" (\\"I'm Backing Wales\\").\\"Car stickers now proclaim 'Backing Wales'\\", The Guardian, 22 January 1968, p. 4. Concerns While telegrams of congratulation continued to flood into Colt, the British Productivity Council was sceptical of its effectiveness. The Council pointed to the difference between productivity and output and stated that each individual firm must consider what would be appropriate in its circumstances depending on its \\"agreements between management and working people\\". Trades Union Congress general secretary George Woodcock, while welcoming the \\"very good spirit\\" of the campaign, said that the trade unions would not foster it and that some unions would strongly oppose it. The Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU) shop stewards at Colt's factory in Havant carefully said that workers could work the extra half-hour without pay but that it would not prejudice any decision taken by the AEU national executive.\\"Support for 'back Britain' move\\", The Times, 2 January 1968, p. 2. Confederation of British Industry President John Davies thought the campaign could be a kind of window-dressing such as he had recently criticised but thought it should be encouraged because of the effect it might have on people's minds.Eric Silver, \\"'Back Britain' drive said to be a gimmick\\", The Guardian, 2 January 1968, p. 14. Contrasting with the generally positive reaction from politicians, Conservative MP Enoch Powell described the campaign as silly and dangerous. He observed, \\"I am not accusing the Government of having suborned those Surrey typists, but the Government could not have wished for a better reinforcement for their campaign to instil into the people of Britain the conviction that it is all their own fault\\".Philip Howard, \\"Colt workers defy union ruling\\", The Times, 11 January 1968, p. 1. =Trade union reaction= On 3 January, the AEU's Portsmouth branch ordered its members not to participate in the campaign, with its district secretary Rory McCarthy explaining that \\"there are many reasons why the union is against giving buckshee half hours to employers\\" and that employers might use it to hide inefficiencies. The workers at the factory immediately rebelled, with works convener Harry Tyler saying \\"no one likes being told what to do with their free time by the union\\" and said that some who were opposed had changed their view because of the union's attitude.\\"'Work without pay' men defy union\\", The Times, 4 January 1968, p. 1. Tyler was removed from his post as union branch chairman by a vote of no confidence on 5 January after members of the branch from companies not taking part in the campaign went to the regular branch meeting.\\"'Back Britain' Man Ousted\\", The Times, 6 January 1968, p. 1. Some of the secretaries who started the campaign appeared on television discussing the trade union reaction with union leaders; the trade union leaders came across as talking down to the secretaries, an attitude that was felt to have helped the campaign.\\"The Surbiton Revolution\\", The Economist, 6 January 1968, p. 12. The AEU national executive instructed its members to have nothing to do with unpaid overtime, setting up a direct confrontation with the factory where more than half of the union members signed a petition backing the campaign and supporting Tyler. The union's Portsmouth district committee then convened a secret court in early February, which convicted four shop stewards at Colt of discrediting the union and imposed punishments suspending the men from holding office in the union for between one and five years.\\"Back Britain men tried in secret\\", The Times, 7 February 1968, p. 1. On hearing the news, forty Conservative backbench MPs put down a motion in the House of Commons demanding government action to \\"stop this type of petty trade union tyranny, which is so completely contrary to the best traditions of the freedom-loving British trade union movement\\".\\"MPs' call to stop 'union tyranny'\\", The Times, 8 February 1968, p. 2. Other trade unionists were generally sceptical. Clive Jenkins, general secretary of the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs, thought it was a \\"confidence trick\\" and observed that \\"when the British ruling class is in trouble it wraps itself in the Union Jack\\".\\"Back Britain drive called a trick\\", The Times, 2 February 1968, p. 4. Twenty years later, the managing director of Colt admitted that he had received hate mail about the campaign and had arranged for the women to be chaperoned. Press comment Popular newspapers backed the campaign enthusiastically and praised the workers behind it. As early as 30 December 1967, the Daily Express ran the headline \\"Five Girls Britain Can be Proud of\\" over a picture of the five originators with Fred Price.Daily Express, Saturday 30 December 1967, p. 1. Seen in the background of this picture , taken on 4 January 1968. The Daily Mirror welcomed the spread of the campaign as its lead story on 3 January.\\"Rush to Join 'No Pay' Workers\\", Daily Mirror, 3 January 1968, p. 1. Despite its traditional Labour and trade union sympathies, it supported the Colt shop stewards against the union leadership.\\"'Work for Britain' Men Defy AEU Ban\\", Daily Mirror, 4 January 1968, p. 1; \\"AEU Sack Back-Britain Union Boss\\", Daily Mirror, 6 January 1968, p. 1. A Mirror editorial on 5 January declared that \\"the patriotic truth about these rule-book dominated trade union sourpusses is that they are incapable of recognising true patriotism when they see it\\".\\"The patriots and the sourpusses\\" (Leader), Daily Mirror, 5 January 1968, p. 2. The Economist wrote on 6 January that on hearing of the campaign, \\"the fashionable response in many sophisticated circles was a giggle\\", but it had transformed into \\"something louder than a grunt of admiration\\". The newspaper concluded that the campaign \\"may very well have accomplished, in the past week, the extraordinary feat of edging a national mood just an odd half- degree in the right direction\\". Likewise, the Financial Times regarded it as \\"a beacon of light in an otherwise dismal economic and industrial prospect\\" but encouraged the diversion of the campaign into opposing absenteeism and restrictive practices as well as encouraging individuals \\"to identify their efforts with the success or failure of the country as a whole\\".Leader, 5 January 1968. Quoted in David Kynaston, The Financial Times: A Centenary History (Penguin Books, 1988), p. 367. A week later, the Economist leader was slightly more wary about the campaign and saw it as a symptom of widespread disenchantment with politics and thinking Britain lucky that \\"there is no demagogue of sufficient ability around to exploit it\\".\\"Who's Really Backing Britain?\\", The Economist, 13 January 1968, p. 14. The New Statesman admitted that \\"in strictly economic terms\\", the campaign to work extra hours made sense, but pointed to some of the oddities of the campaign, including the Birmingham betting shop, which had opened early as a contribution to the production drive, and the Portsmouth workers, who demanded to leave early so they could see a television programme about the scheme.\\"From Surbiton to Whitehall\\", New Statesman, 12 January 1968, p. 29. Popular campaign On Monday 8 January, Pye Records issued a 45 rpm single of the song \\"I'm Backing Britain\\" supporting the campaign. Written by Tony Hatch and Jackie Trent, and sung by Bruce Forsyth, the chorus included \\"The feeling is growing, so let's keep it going, the good times are blowing our way\\". All involved in making the single took cuts in their fees or royalties so that the single sold for 5 shillings instead of the going rate of 7s d. Forsyth happily endorsed the campaign: \\"The country has always done its best when it is up against the wall. If everyone realises what we are up against we can get out of trouble easily.\\"\\"Song for the typists\\" (Business Diary), The Times, 8 January 1968, p. 19. However, the song did not make the charts;Craig Brown, \\"Way of the world: A mutual case of wow\\", Daily Telegraph, 4 June 2005, p. 23. it sold only 7319 copies.\\"Who's still Backing Britain?\\", Daily Mirror, 3 May 1968, p. 17 The most visible manifestation of the campaign was in the Union Flags, which begin to be put on shopping bags. Even the Prime Minister noted that everyone seemed to be carrying them.Harold Wilson, \\"The Labour Government 1964‚Äì1970: A Personal Record\\" (Weidenfeld & Nicolson and Michael Joseph, 1971), p. 481. Postmaster General Edward Short encouraged the Royal Mail to introduce an \\"I'm Backing Britain\\" franking mark,Hansard, House of Commons 5th Series, vol. 760, col. 622. which was used on 84 million letters passing through 125 Post Offices between 9 and 29 February.Hansard, House of Commons 5th series, vol. 762, col. 1570. Increased visibility of the Union Flag distressed some commentators. Philip French, writing in the New Statesman, described being \\"constantly confronted\\" by the flag as \\"one of the more painful aspects\\" of the campaign.Philip French, \\"Put Out Less Flags\\", New Statesman, 19 January 1968, p. 85. The campaign found expression in the giving of conscience money to the Exchequer, as noted by The Guardian Financial Editor William Davis;William Davis, \\"Taking stock of THAT campaign\\", The Guardian, 10 January 1968, p. 10. in the middle of January, it was observed that every postal delivery to the Treasury contained letters offering gifts. If the letter specified that the money was to pay off the Government debt, the funds were paid into the Debt Redemption Fund; otherwise the Consolidated Fund was the beneficiary.George Hawthorne, \\"Almost every post boosts Exchequer\\", The Guardian, 12 January 1968, p. 4. Disc jockey Jimmy Savile found his own way to support the campaign by volunteering to work nine days as a hospital porter at Leeds General Infirmary over two months, stating that at his rate of pay, nine days' work would have earned him ¬£1,600 (equivalent to ¬£ in ).Michael Parkin, \\"A DJ sets the hospital spinning\\", The Guardian, 10 January 1968, p. 3. =Portuguese T-shirts= The campaign took a knock when the London wholesaler Scott Lester ordered thousands of white T-shirts on which it screen-printed the \\"I'm Backing Britain\\" slogan; the shirts had been made in Portugal. Scott Lester's marketing director explained that \\"we just cannot find a British T-shirt which will give us the same quality at a price which will compare\\" and that the shirts would have to retail at ¬£1 if British sources were used.George Hawthorne, \\"Portugal's shirts on Britain's backs\\", The Guardian, 13 January 1968, p. 1. See also \\"Branded in Britain\\", BBC News online, 26 February 2002. Labour MP Charles Mapp urged the Government to ban the shirts.Hansard, House of Commons 5th series, vol. 758 col. 124. =Poet Laureate= The newly appointed Poet Laureate, Cecil Day-Lewis, inaugurated his appointment with a poem entitled \\"Now and Then\\" supporting the campaign. It was commissioned by the Daily Mail and appeared on the newspaper's front page on 5 January;Ian Hamilton, \\"Snoop Doggy Dogg for Laureate\\", London Review of Books, 7 January 1999. The poem compared Britain's economic plight in 1968 with the Blitz and ended: Day-Lewis's choice of subject and the content of his poem were criticised. Bernard Levin later wrote that the poem \\"made many regret their impulsive rejoicing at the death of his predecessor\\".Bernard Levin, \\"The Pendulum Years: Britain and the Sixties\\" (Jonathan Cape, 1970), p. 426. Takeover Such was the response coming into Colt that they found themselves overwhelmed and needed someone else to take it over. It asked the Industrial Society, a nonpartisan body to promote the best use of human resources in commerce and industry, which agreed and began to set up an organisation to run it. The society recruited 11 extra full-time staff in January 1968 for the campaign,Henry Stanhope, \\"'Back Britain' leaders not upset by factory decision\\", The Times, 12 February 1968, p. 2. Joe Haines, \\"Maxwell\\", Macdonald, 1988, p. 277, gives the number of full time staff engaged by the Industrial Society as 25. and appointed Admiral of the Fleet Sir Caspar John as its figurehead.Jonas Smith, \\"Labour drops 'back Britain' posters\\", The Times, 25 January 1968, p. 1. The campaign was handled on a day-to-day basis by Mark Wolfson, the Head of Youth Services for the Society. The Guardian's Financial Editor William Davis had already noted in his column of 10 January that attention was moving away from the idea of providing free labour. The Industrial Society also stressed that working extra half-hours was \\"a tiny part\\" of the national campaign and criticised people who tried to make anti- union propaganda out of the reaction to the case. Industrial Society director John Garnett pointed to tanker drivers who had switched from 56 hours driving slowly per week to 42 hours of faster driving. The Society convened a group of industrialists and leading trade unionists to reshape the official aims of the campaign.John Fairhall, \\"Reshaping the aims of Backing Britain movement\\", The Guardian, 13 January 1968, p. 2. The Society found it difficult to make progress in getting the campaign adopted in more workplaces because of suspicion about their motives. A campaign adviser told the Daily Mirror that many assumed they were connected to the Labour Party and \\"without its political flavour, I am sure the campaign would have been taken a lot more seriously\\".Daily Mirror, 1 February 1968. =Robert Maxwell's 'Buy British' campaign= According to his biographer Joe Haines, the Labour Member of Parliament Robert Maxwell had the idea for a popular 'Buy British' campaign around the same time as the 'I'm Backing Britain' campaign emerged. Through an intermediary, Maxwell approached broadcaster David Frost, who gave a personal donation of ¬£1,000 and invited Maxwell to appear on his television show on 5 January.Joe Haines, \\"Maxwell\\", Macdonald, 1988, p. 271. On television Maxwell told viewers to \\"think before buying. Buy the home product or service first whenever you can, even if it means buying less for a time\\". Maxwell tried to amalgamate his campaign with that of the Industrial Society, but the Society refused him.Tom Bower, \\"Maxwell: The Outsider\\", Aurum Press, 1988, p. 109. He therefore set up a rival \\"Help Britain Group\\". Maxwell obtained letters of support from well-known personalities and launched his campaign with full-page press adverts on 7 February. The adverts, topped with pictures of the three main party leaders, urged readers to \\"Act on just six of the uncranky suggestions on this page\\" and listed those who had supported him.How to Help Britain and Yourself Campaign advert, The Times, 7 February 1968, p. 3. One of those named, Bernard Delfont, was upset when his support was revealed, feeling that Maxwell should have asked him before doing so.Joe Haines, \\"Maxwell\\", Macdonald, 1988, p. 273. Critics pointed to the fact that Maxwell's Pergamon Press printed a large number of its textbooks and scientific journals in Eastern European countries. According to Maxwell's widow, Elizabeth, his campaign won \\"the hearts and minds of countless ordinary workers around Britain\\".Elizabeth Maxwell, \\"A Mind of My Own\\", Sidgwick and Jackson, 1994, p. 372. However Maxwell dropped the 'Buy British' part of his campaign by the end of February (retitling it 'Sell British, Help Britain, Help Yourself'),Joe Haines, \\"Maxwell\\", Macdonald, 1988, p. 274. and he wound up the whole thing in March. Maxwell's unofficial biographer, Tom Bower, noted that Maxwell succeeded in becoming the nationally recognised personality of the whole 'Backing Britain' campaign,Tom Bower, \\"Maxwell: The Outsider\\", Aurum Press, 1988, p. 110. but former Maxwell editor Roy Greenslade noted that Maxwell was \\"a rogue politician\\" whose protectionist campaign was a \\"fruitless [cause]\\".Roy Greenslade, \\"Maxwell\\", Birch Lane, 1992, p. 38. Political influence At an after-dinner speech in Burnley on 8 January, Prime Minister Harold Wilson criticised those who were \\"complaining that the other fellow is not pulling his weight\\" including trade unionists who pointed to the failures of individual employers. Wilson declared \\"What we want is 'back Britain', not back-biting\\".John Chartres, \\"Wilson Joins 'I Back Britain'\\", The Times, 9 January 1968, p. 1. Wilson, who later wrote that the campaign \\"was a helpful and robust response to the gloom and near-defeatism\\" after devaluation, put Edmund Dell, Under-Secretary at the Department of Economic Affairs, in charge of government assistance. Dell visited Colt on 8 January 1968\\"Sponsor to Run 'Back Britain'\\", The Times, 9 January 1968, p. 2. but kept his assistance largely concealed.Robert Sheldon, \\"Dell, Edmund Emanuel\\" in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 2 March 2008. Cabinet minister Richard Crossman wrote in his diary on 7 January that the expanding campaign was a \\"political windfall\\" but that it was \\"something we should have nothing to do with\\".Richard Crossman, \\"The Crossman Diaries\\" (Condensed version), Magnum Books, 1979, p. 439. The Labour Party found itself in difficulty when it ordered 2,000 posters with the slogan \\"Back Britain with Labour\\" for local Labour Parties to display. After a complaint from a member of the Industrial Society, the posters were withdrawn. The Industrial Society also reported resisting an attempt by the Conservative Party to \\"borrow\\" the slogan for political purposes.\\"Back Britain group may seek aid\\", The Times, 22 March 1968, p. 5. Campaign winds down After the AEU banned the four Colt shop stewards from office, the shop stewards recommended to the workers at the Havant factory on 10 February that they stop working unpaid overtime because of the strife it had brought to the union, but the works director thought that the workers would in fact continue and pointed to the fact that the AEU was not the only union present. Joan Southwell, one of the original five secretaries at the head office, said that they would definitely continue as \\"we are all very solid about this in spite of the union disagreement\\".Henry Stanhope, \\"'Back Britain' leaders not upset by factory decision\\", The Times, 12 February 1968, p. 2. However, on 12 February the workers decided by a narrow majority to return to normal working hours.\\"AEF men end free working\\", The Times, 13 February 1968, p. 3. In early February, The Times went round to ask supermarket chains what the campaign was achieving and found that it varied between \\"very little\\" and \\"none at all\\".\\"Business Diary\\", The Times, 6 February 1968, p. 21. By the middle of March, the Industrial Society was hinting that it needed a grant from the government to keep going. It had encouraged local civic leaders across the country to set up local committees of industrialists and trade unionists. The television series \\"Dad's Army\\", the opening episode of which was recorded on 15 April 1968, began with a contemporary scene in which Alderman Mainwaring was the chairman of the Walmington-on-Sea \\"I'm Backing Britain\\" campaign. Another reference to the campaign appeared in the title of a newspaper comic strip collection. From a distance, its title appeared to read The Perishers Back Britain. Only on closer inspection could the full title be read: The Perishers: Back Again to Pester Britain. The Sunday Times ran a large article by Nicholas Tomalin on 3 March about \\"the serious and comic history of a patriotic idea\\". Tomalin quoted one of the original Surbiton typists as saying that \\"we got mixed-up when asked horrid questions about trade unions. Thanks to all the interviews and things, we just didn't get any typing done\\".Tomalin did not identify which of the five had made this remark. See Sunday Times, 3 March 1968; Tomalin's article is also reprinted in \\"Nicholas Tomalin reporting\\" (Andre Deutsch, 1975), p. 254-69. Also in March, the campaign moved from the Industrial Society's headquarters at Bryanston Square to rent-free offices donated by National Cash Register. It was immediately noted that National Cash Register was a wholly owned subsidiary of an American corporation.\\"Business Diary\\", The Times, 22 March 1968, p. 25. The Industrial Society's staff working on the campaign were down to four in May 1968.Joe Haines, \\"Maxwell\\", Macdonald, 1988, p. 277. Maxwell declared his campaign was officially over on 5 August. The Industrial Society was still receiving about 15 letters a day, but its campaign was limited to sending out badges and promotional material to people who had requested them, and it declared that the campaign office would close at the end of September.Christine Eade, \\"'Backing Britain' campaign over\\", The Guardian, 6 August 1968, p. 2. Retrospectively, Bernard Levin saw that the enthusiasm had subsided \\"after a month or two\\" and that the badges and slogans were seen no more.Bernard Levin, \\"The Pendulum Years: Britain and the Sixties\\" (Jonathan Cape, 1970), p. 427. Reaction There was a widespread feeling, even while the campaign was going on, that it was fundamentally risible. New Statesman columnist Philip French thought its \\"jingoism and intellectual dishonesty\\" was offensive and felt that the excessive press coverage defied comment \\"other than the gesture of laughing at\\" it. The magazine itself ran a one-off column, to go with its long-established \\"This England\\" column, featuring press cuttings highlighting absurd aspects of the campaign.\\"Backing Britain\\", New Statesman, 19 January 1968, p. 69. The Communist Morning Star newspaper published a parody of the Maxwell advert, which claimed to be \\"non- political, non-partisan and nonsensical\\" and proclaimed the support of nonsense poets Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll.Morning Star, 8 February 1968. Paul McCartney thought the campaign was ridiculous and it inspired him to write a parody song called \\"I'm Backing the UK\\", which eventually became \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\" on the Beatles' 1968 double LP known as the \\"White Album\\". The first episode of what was to be the long-running Dad's Army sitcom, shown on 31 July 1968, begins with a pre-title sequence flashforward showing the lead characters at a dinner to launch the Walmington-on-Sea \\"I'm Backing Britain\\" campaign event. At the conclusion of the film Carry On... Up the Khyber, made during the summer and opening in November 1968, the raising of a Union Flag with the \\"I'm Backing Britain\\" slogan is greeted by Peter Butterworth turning to camera and saying: \\"Of course, they're all raving mad, you know!\\" See also * Whip Inflation Now * Domestic sourcing BBC Radio 4 broadcast in September 2018 a 45-minute radio play We're Backing Britain by David Morley, dramatising the events.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) between 1905 and 1913 for the Philadelphia Athletics, Boston Americans, New York Highlanders, Washington Senators, and New York Yankees. A native of Philadelphia, he was signed out of the University of Pennsylvania. Career Knight was nineteen when he entered the majors in 1905 with the Philadelphia Athletics, playing for them two and a half years before joining the Boston Americans (1907), New York Highlanders (1909‚Äì11), Washington Senators (1912) and New York Yankees (1913). Knight was in the Athletics 1905 Opening Day as a replacement for incumbent shortstop Monte Cross, out until mid-season with a broken hand. He responded hitting .400 in June, but faded after that and finished the season at .203. In the 1907 midseason Knight was sent to Boston in exchange for Jimmy Collins. He spent 1908 with Triple-A Baltimore Orioles and returned to the majors with New York a year later. His most productive season came in 1910, when he posted a career-high .312 (5th in American League) and led his team in seven offensive categories. In 1911 he was considered in the MVP vote after hitting .268 with 32 extrabases and 62 runs batted in. Another deal in 1912 sent him to the Senators, who released him to Double-A Jersey City Giants, but he returned to New York in 1913 to finish his major league career. In an eight-year career, Knight was a .239 hitter (636-for-2664) with 14 home runs and 270 RBI in 767 games, including 301 runs, 96 doubles, 24 triples and 86 stolen bases. He made 755 infield appearances at shortstop (316), third base (211), first base (124) and second base (104) and one at right field, for a collective .933 fielding percentage. After that, his frequent travels took Knight to the Minneapolis Millers (American Association); Seattle Rainiers and Oakland Oaks (Pacific Coast League), Denver Bears (Western League) and Sacramento Solons (PCL), before returning to Denver as player-manager in 1928 for his last baseball season. He was just briefly at the University of Pennsylvania Dental School in 1912. Knight died in Walnut Creek, California at age 80.

Biography  Miƒ∑elis Krogzemis was born in Sƒ´poli, Ungurpils to a peasant family. He attended parochial school in Aloja and later in ƒírgƒºi. In ƒírgƒºi he met members of the JurjƒÅni family who got him in touch with the Young Latvian movement. In 1868 he was admitted to the teachers' seminary in Valka under the leadership of Latvian composer JƒÅnis Cimze. While in Valka he studied European literature and philosophy of the Age of Enlightenment. After graduating in 1871, Krogzemis begin his teaching career in Jaunpiebalga but soon was forced to leave the school due to conflicts with the local pastor. He then taught briefly in Cƒìsis before moving to LielvƒÅrde to teach. In LielvƒÅrde he became active in the local cultural life. He organised theater and choir and in 1873 participated in the first Latvian song festival in Riga. However, due to these activities and his anticlerical poetry, he soon found himself in conflict with the local pastor and was forced to leave. Krogzemis moved to Vecpiebalga where he lived and worked with Atis Kronvalds, but their collaboration proved unsuccessful. He subsequently moved to Riga to seek employment. In 1874 he left for St. Petersburg where he taught in several schools and wrote literature. In St. Petersburg he became close friends with Latvian composer Bauma≈Üu KƒÅrlis and contributed to the satirical magazine Dunduri. In 1879 Krogzemis became ill with typhus and died on February 6. His funeral ceremony in Aloja attracted national attention.  Literature  Miƒ∑elis Krogzemis is better known under his pen name Auseklis. His first publication was in the newspaper Baltijas Vƒìstnesis in 1872. In his poetry he richly used motives of folklore and became one of the leading voices of the First Latvian National Awakening in poetry. In his satirical poems he stood against Baltic German landowners, germanisation and obscurantism.

Catastrophins affect microtubule shortening, a process known as microtubule catastrophe.  Overview of Microtubule Dynamics  Microtubules are polymers of tubulin subunits arranged in cylindrical tubes. The subunit is made up of alpha and beta tubulin. GTP binds to alpha tubulin irreversibly. Beta tubulin binds GTP and hydrolyzes to GDP. It is the GDP bound to beta-tubulin that regulates the growth or disassembly of the microtubule. However, this GDP can be displaced by GTP. Beta-tubulin bounded to GTP are describe as having a GTP-cap that enables stable growth. Microtubules exist either in either a stable or unstable state. The unstable form of a microtubule is often found in cells that are undergoing rapid changes such as mitosis. The unstable form exists in a state of dynamic instability where the filaments grow and shrink seemingly randomly. A mechanistic understanding of what causes microtubules to shrink is still being developed.  Model of Catastrophe  One model proposes that loss of the GTP-cap causes the GDP-containing protofilaments to shrink. Based on this GTP-cap model, catastrophe happens randomly. The model proposes that an increase in microtubule growth will correlate with a decrease in random catastrophe frequency or vice versa. The discovery of microtubule-associated proteins that change the rate of catastrophe while not impacting the rate of microtubule growth challenges this model of stochastic growth and shrinkage. = Catastrophins that Increase Catastrophe = Oncoprotein 18/Stathmin has been shown to increase the frequency of catastrophe. The Kinesin-related protein XKCM1 stimulates catastrophes in Xenopus microtubules. The Kinesin- Related Protein 13 MCAK increases the frequency of catastrophe without affecting the promotion of microtubule growth. = Catastrophins that Inhibit Catastrophe = Doublecortin (DCX) shows an ability to inhibit catastrophe without affecting the microtubule growth rate Xenopus Microtubule Protein 215 (XMAP215) has been implicated in inhibiting catastrophe. = Mechanisms of Catastrophins = Some catastrophins affect catastrophe by binding to the ends of microtubules and promoting the dissociation of tubulin dimers. Different mathematical models of microtubule development are being developed to take into account in vitro and in vivo observations. Meanwhile, there are new in vitro models of microtubule polymerization dynamics, of which catastrophins take a part in, being tested to emulate in vivo behaviors of microtubules. = See also = * Microtubule-associated protein * Kinesin = References = Motor proteins ","title":"Catastrophin"},{"id":"16061738","text":"JEA is a municipal utility service in Jacksonville, Florida JEA or Jea may also refer to: * Jersey European Airways, defunct British airline *JeA (singer) (born 1981), a South Korean singer * Jea, one half of Japanese electronic music collective DJ Sharpnel * Japan Electric Association * Japan Evangelical Association *Jordanian Engineers Association *John Emil Augustine * Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, a scholarly journal on Egyptology * Journalism Education Association, a national organization for teachers and advisers of journalism. * Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, a public law of the United States initiating the relocation of its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem People with the surname Jea *John Jea (born 1773), American slave and autobiographer ","title":"JEA (disambiguation)"},{"id":"16061763","title":"Central American Integration System"},{"id":"16061804","text":"Woolwich Dock, Sydney Woolwich Dock is a former dry dock and shipyard in Woolwich, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The site was purchased by Morts Dock and Engineering Company in 1898. When it was officially opened on 4 December 1901 it was the biggest dry dock in Australia, at long and wide. Several extensions were carried out between 1902 and 1918, and the dock was lengthened to 260 metres. To achieve this William Street was acquired and a new road constructed ‚Äì Franki Avenue, named after the general manager and later managing director of the company, James Peter Franki. By 1917 the company employed over 1,500 people. In the 1940s the Atlas workshops were replaced by the sawtooth roofed building which still stands on the site and several brick buildings were added. The busiest times for Woolwich Dock were during the two world wars when many passenger vessels were converted to armed troopships and repairs were carried out on damaged ships. After the Second World War work declined and the dock was closed down in 1958 and until 1963 the dock was vacant. 1963‚Äì1997: Army Occupation The Australian Army purchased it in 1963 for its water transport operations. The three oldest buildings on the site were demolished and the Army erected a number of metal prefabricated buildings, added timber fender piers and timber wharves to the dock itself and constructed a traveling boat crane beside the dock. They made use of the dock for launching craft and the workshops for repairs and maintenance. The Army units based at Woolwich were relocated to Townsville, Queensland, in 1997. 1997 Onwards In the late 1990s it was proposed that the land be sold to developers. A community group, Foreshore 2000 Woolwich, was formed to protest against sale of the site and through the lobbying efforts of this group and the local council, the Australian Government agreed to the site being returned to the people of Sydney. In 2001 the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust was formed to administer Woolwich Dock and various other sites around Sydney Harbour.

The project aims to create searchable digital indexes of scanned images of historical documents that are relevant to genealogy. The documents include census records, birth and death certificates, marriage licenses, military and property records, and other vital records maintained by local, state, and national governments. However, to access the billions of names that appear on these images, indexes are needed to be able to search them efficiently. Since FamilySearch indexing began in 2006, this crowdsourcing effort has produced more than one billion searchable records. The digital images and corresponding indexes are valuable to professionals, hobbyists, and family organization researchers.  How it works  Volunteers (including jail inmates) use online software on the FamilySearch website to download images of historical documents. They then read the information on the image and transcribe the information. A second, more experienced volunteer reviews this information for accuracy before it is submitted. Indexed records eventually can be searched on the FamilySearch website. From 2006 to 2017 FamilySearch Indexing was only available as a downloadable program, and two volunteers separately indexed each document. A third person checked their work for accuracy. As of 2016, FamilySearch Indexing is also available as a web- based effort. Types of records Up to December 2008, the FamilySearch Indexing project focused primarily on indexing state and federal census records from the United States of America, though census records from Mexico and vital records from other locales have also been indexed. In 2012, FamilySearch Indexing collaborated with Archives.com and FindMyPast to index the 1940 US Federal Census. In 2014, an emphasis was placed on obituary projects. As of December 2015, the organization had indexed 1,379,890,025 records since its inception. As of July 2018 there were 226 active indexing projects, with documents from all over the world being indexed. The majority of projects come from either North America or Europe. The United States is the country with the most records but a majority of projects now come from outside the United States. In addition to the general indexing projects, the site also partners with other genealogical organizations to complete specialized indexing projects. Partners have included the Arkansas Genealogical Society, the Black History Museum, the Indiana Genealogical Society, the Ohio Genealogical Society, the US National Archives and Records Administration , and the Utah Genealogical Association.

The name Mere Brow is believed to have come from the time when it was the most northerly settlement on Martin Mere. Economy Mere Brow was primarily an agricultural village due to the excellent soil, although there was fishing activity for many years. Production of flowers and vegetables is common on the farms around the village.

Life and career Cox was born in Birmingham, England, where his father was a university lecturer in chemistry. After wartime evacuation to Canada, Cox attended King Edward's School, Birmingham and Leeds Grammar School. He completed national service in the Royal Engineers between 1950 and 1952. He then took a scholarship to The Queen's College, Oxford, where he obtained a first-class degree in geology in 1956. He lost an eye in an accident in the Lake District whilst on a field trip in 1955. After Oxford, Cox carried out further research at the University of Leeds before being appointed lecturer in petrology at Edinburgh University. In 1972 he became a lecturer in geology at Oxford, being appointed a fellow of Jesus College, Oxford in 1973. He was appointed a Reader in 1988, the same year in which he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. He made several trips to South Africa and collaborated with local geochemists such as Dr. A.J. Erlank. He drowned in a sailing accident at Erraid off the Isle of Mull in the Hebrides on 27 August 1998. Work Cox's doctoral and post-doctoral research at Leeds was on the Masukwe Complex in the Nuanetsi region of what was then called Southern Rhodesia. This led to his developing a particular interest in flood basalts, upon which topic he in due course became a world expert. Cox contemplated the significance of the geochemistry of these rocks during his work in the Karoo region and, whilst at Edinburgh, also studied comparable rocks from the Deccan area of India, as well as rocks from southern Arabia. His research at Oxford also covered flood basalts in the Parana region of South America, the Hebrides and Antarctica. He also studied kimberlites.

The organization acts as the NCAA does in other college sports ‚Äî setting game play, eligibility, and organizational rules. College Curling USA is affiliated with United States Curling Association (USCA), the organization responsible for organizing Olympic teams. History The idea of college curling in the USA began in the late 1980s when the Illinois State Curling Foundation (ISCF) began to look into college curling, filling a gap between junior and adult curling levels. The ISCF, along with curling clubs, began promoting the idea of curling to schools. National Tournament began in the early 1990s with only a few schools in Northern Illinois and Wisconsin. Since then, has boomed to more than 40 schools- mostly in the Northern tier of the US and Northeast US. New Programs are starting all over the US as new clubs are being established. The Mission of the USA Curling College Championship is to promote the growth of college curling through the establishment of a national championship that encourages and rewards curlers attending a college or university who compete against their peers at other academic institutions throughout the school year The Goal of the USA Curling College Championship is the promotion and development of on campus curling clubs and curling activities. While many college/university campuses have curlers who participate in curling activities at nearby community curling clubs, few have formally organized into campus clubs. There are many advantages to being a recognized on campus club including added student body exposure to curling activities and access to student organization funds that may help defray the costs of curling activities. In the 2012-13 season, more than 200 curlers from 36 colleges or universities participated in College Curling USA sanctioned events.

Shepard (November 10, 1846 - March 1, 1895), was a captain in the United States Revenue Cutter Service and was appointed in 1889 by Secretary of the Treasury William Windom as the first military head of the service since 1869. His formal title was that of Chief of the Revenue Marine Division of the Department of the Treasury. Although he was never formally known as Commandant, he is recognized today as the first Commandant of the Coast Guard.  Military career = Early years= Shepard was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts in 1846.King, p 72 He entered the Revenue Cutter Service as a third lieutenant on September 15, 1865, reporting aboard the USRC Moccasin.King, p 72 He was promoted to second lieutenant in 1869 and first lieutenant in 1870. As first lieutenant he commanded the USRC James Guthrie in Baltimore as well as USRC Washington and USRC Grant in New York.Register of the Commissioned Officers of the United States Revenue Marine, to April 1, 1875\\", p 21, Coast Guard Historical Documents, U.S. Coast Guard Historians Office After his promotion to captain on March 14, 1878 he took command of the USRC McLane at Galveston, Texas and the USRC George Bibb at Ogdensburg, New York. In 1883 he took command of the Revenue Cutter School at New Bedford, Massachusetts and the USRC Salmon P. Chase.King, p 72 From 1887 to 1889 he was in command of the USRC Rush in San Francisco, California and just before his appointment to chief of the division was serving as commanding officer of the USRC Bear.King, p 73Strobridge and Noble, p 50 = Chief of Revenue Cutter Service= On December 14, 1889, Shepard was named to the position of Chief of the Revenue Marine Division.King, p 72 Although the Revenue Marine Bureau existed prior to the appointment, the command of the bureau belonged to the Chief of Customs Collectors, and as such Captain Leonard G. Shepard became Chief of the \\"Revenue Marine Division\\" and is considered to be the first Commandant. He immediately began a campaign of reform and petitioned for funds for new cutters and a plan for officer retirement pensions.King, p 73Johnson, p 17 His plan was to quit spending money on repair of older vessels that did not meet modern needs of the service and acquire new vessels that served more efficiently.King, p 73 The officer situation was one of many officers serving well into their eighties, thus hindering younger officers chances of promotion. This affected the morale of the service considerably and kept many able young men from joining the service. The senior officers stayed on in command because of a lack of a retirement pension.King, p 74 Shepard closed the Revenue Cutter School at Fort Trumbull, Connecticut soon after assuming the office of Chief of the Revenue Cutter Division to dramatize the lack promotion opportunities and the last class of Cadets graduated in May 1890.King, p 74 He also fought for the passage of HR 6723; a bill that created a medical review board that examined senior officers and eliminated those not fit to command.King, p 76 Secretary of the Treasury John Griffin Carlisle pointed out that about a third of the officers of the Revenue Marine could not perform their duties because of advanced age and pressed Congress for relief. Shepard fought for passage of the retirement plan in Congress. The bill was signed into law on March 2, 1895 and Shepard died of pneumonia on March 14, twelve days later. Although the new retirement plan did not solve all of the problems of the Revenue Marine Service, it did force the retirement of 39 officers determined by a medical board to be unhealthy enough for duty and gave them a half pay allowance. This allowed the Revenue Marine to free up billets and give junior officers better promotion opportunities.King, p 77  Death and legacy Captain Shepard died March 14, 1895, of pneumonia in Washington, DC, leaving his wife, Isabel S. Shepard and three children.King, p 47 By petitioning for newer design cutters and a retirement plan for older officers, Shepard is given credit for continuing his civilian predecessors efforts to modernize the service. During his tenure several newer steel hull tugs and larger cutters were acquired by the service. Although his retirement plan was not perfect, it did set the stage for Shepard's successors make additional improvements.

After their work in the 1960s, Shepp and Parlan both faced career challenges as the jazz scene diverged stylistically. They left the United States for Europe during the 1970s and met each other in Denmark before recording the album on April 25, 1977, at Sweet Silence Studio in Copenhagen. A jazz and gospel album, Goin' Home features Shepp and Parlan's interpretations of African-American folk melodies and spirituals. Its title is an allusion to Shepp's return to his African cultural roots. Shepp had never recorded spirituals before and was overcome with emotion during the album's recording because of the historical and cultural context of the songs. Although it surprised jazz listeners upon its release in 1977, Goin' Home was praised by music critics for its reverent tone and stylistic deviation from Shepp's previous free jazz works. Shepp and Parlan were artistically satisfied with the album and subsequently recorded another album together, Trouble in Mind, in 1980. Goin' Home was reissued on CD by SteepleChase Records on May 3, 1994.  Background  Shepp in 1982, playing the soprano saxophone After rising to the top of the avant-garde jazz movement during the 1960s, Archie Shepp faced a career challenge during the 1970s after the style lost popularity in the jazz scene, which had split between artists who played either a tamer or a more experimental sound. Shepp became a more mainstream performer, mostly playing hard bop, although he would occasionally return to his free jazz sound. To support himself financially, he spent most of his time playing in Europe. In 1972, jazz pianist Horace Parlan left the United States and eventually settled in Denmark, where Shepp had signed to SteepleChase Records. Shepp became interested in recording gospel and, at the request of his producer at SteepleChase, recorded Goin' Home with Parlan. They recorded the album on April 25, 1977, at Sweet Silence Studio in Copenhagen, Denmark. Shepp played tenor saxophone on six pieces and soprano saxophone on three others. Both Shepp and Parlan were artistically satisfied with Goin' Home and recorded another album together, the blues-inspired Trouble in Mind, in 1980.  Composition and performance  According to music journalist Tom Moon, Goin' Home is a reverent jazz and gospel album played with straightforward simplicity by Shepp and Parlan. They interpret nine traditional Negro spirituals, featuring African-American folk melodies that originated from the 1920s and before. Along with Trouble in Mind and Looking at Bird in 1980, Goin' Home is part of a series of albums delineated in Shepp's discography as \\"modular explorations of traditional musical styles\\", which is itself in Shepp's broader series of musical \\"portraits of the Diaspora\\". The album's title alludes to a return to African cultural roots. Shepp viewed Goin' Home as his attempt to cross the span of time and history between modern African Americans and the black slaves symbolized by the spirituals. In an interview for Down Beat, Shepp said that it was the first time he had recorded spirituals or made \\"any kind of serious statement about them\\", and said that he started to cry when he started playing on the album due to \\"the strain, the spiritual weight of the moment\\". He recalled being momentarily afraid that he would not be able to go through with the album's recording because of his emotional state, which he explained: The album has a melodic form, and employs pentatonic scales for melodic development, a practice common in African and African-American folk music. Goin' Home is mostly tempoless, as most of the pieces are performed in a rubato-like free rhythm. Shepp and Parlan perform sudden accelerations and intended delays and halts, particularly at the end of bars, phrases, and sections in a piece. Most of the spirituals have a thirty- two-bar form, with the eight-bar section comprising four two-bar phrases wherein two choruses of the spiritual are played. Shepp and Parlan's interpretations include few choruses from the original spirituals. Eschewing common jazz practice, Shepp does not improvise new melodic lines within the spirituals' harmonic framework, but plays short, impromptu passages around a melodic idea. Parlan plays piano solos on only two of the album's pieces. Shepp contributes a tonal roughness to the songs with growled sounds, which he plays by singing or humming into his saxophone. He also uses harmonic overtones, breathy tonal weight, and expressive chromatic development of melody to add textural and timbral variety to the songs. Shepp and Parlan's reverent takes on \\"Amazing Grace\\" and Go Down Moses\\" exhibit split tones and fortes.  Release and reception  Goin' Home was first released in 1977 by the Danish label SteepleChase Records. It was reissued on CD by SteepleChase on May 3, 1994. Jazz listeners were divided in their reaction to the album. According to Doug Ramsey of Texas Monthly, some listeners were surprised by Shepp's stylistic change, while others viewed the record as a \\"fulfillment of promise\\". Ramsey believed it revealed a \\"tenderness and humor\\" from Shepp that his 1960s work only hinted at, writing that it \\"disclosed an Archie Shepp that many had never known, warm rather than blistering hot, witty rather than contemptuously sardonic\\". John Swenson, writing in The Rolling Stone Jazz Record Guide (1985), praised Shepp's work with Parlan and found Goin' Home \\"particularly heartfelt.\\" Fernando Gonzalez of The Boston Globe called it \\"exquisite\\", and C. Gerald Fraser of The New York Times wrote in 1987 that \\"this marriage of avant-garde and soul\\" is \\"regarded as a classic.\\" Art Lange of CODA magazine praised Shepp's \\"exquisite control\\" of his instrument, which he \\"quite literally\\" makes \\"able [to] talk\\", and found the spirituals to have been \\"sung\\" rather than just performed. Lange added that the emotional aspect is more impressive than the technical skill and stated: In a retrospective review for AllMusic, jazz critic Scott Yanow found the performances \\"compelling\\" and said listeners who are \\"only familiar with Shepp's earlier Fire Music\\" will see the album as a \\"revelation.\\" Moon believed its tempoless mood \\"gives the themes an extra shot of majesty\\" and found it \\"supremely melodic\\", writing that both Shepp and Parlan \\"do whatever is necessary to bring the spirit to the forefront.\\" JazzTimes cited Goin' Home as one of \\"the finest [albums] of his career\\", and Tom Hull of The Village Voice cited it as SteepleChase's best release. Phil Johnson of The Independent wrote that the album \\"can be listened to almost without cease.\\" Jazz historian Eric Nisenson called it \\"one of the most moving albums of the Seventies\\", but qualified his praise by critiquing that Shepp, an iconic figure in free jazz, \\"was no longer the firebrand who had so frightened and unsettled some white critics and jazz fans.\\" Nisenson felt that, like Pharoah Sanders, Shepp's \\"trial by fire at the heart of the Sixties avant-garde had made him an unusually expressive musician,\\" and Goin' Home showed that he was \\"finding inspiration in the entire black musical tradition.\\"  Track listing  All songs are traditional compositions, excepted where noted, and were arranged by Archie Shepp. Personnel Credits are adapted from the album's liner notes. * Per Grunnet ‚Äì design * Freddy Hansson ‚Äì engineer * Horace Parlan ‚Äì piano * Flemming Rasmussen ‚Äì assistant engineer * Archie Shepp ‚Äì arranger, soprano saxophone, tenor saxophone * Gorm Valentin ‚Äì photography * Nils Winther ‚Äì photographer, producer References  Bibliography      * External links * 1977 albums Archie Shepp albums Horace Parlan albums SteepleChase Records albums ","title":"Goin' Home (Archie Shepp and Horace Parlan album)"},{"id":"16062109","text":"Utricularia longeciliata is a small to medium-sized perennial carnivorous plant that belongs to the genus Utricularia.

In 2008, regional councilors asked the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec to rename Richmond Gulf officially as Lac Tasiujaq. A vast area surrounding the gulf, Clearwater Lakes (Lacs √† l'Eau-Claire), and Iberville Lake (Lac D'Iberville) was included in the Tursujuq National Park, officially established on July 18, 2013.Minist√®re du D√©veloppement durable, de l‚ÄôEnvironnement et des Parcs, Provisional Master Plan Parc national des Lacs- Guillaume-Delisle-et-√†-l'Eau-Claire, Quebec, 2008, (Online version ) Geography The topography of the Richmond Gulf is the consequence of two geological faults running parallel to the coast. The resulting dislocation has given rise to the cliffs that dominate the western shore of the Gulf. The western shore is guarded by the steep ramparts of sedimentary rock that rise abruptly out of the brackish waters. This unusual coastal relief of asymmetrical hills are the Hudsonian Cuestas and the highest system of cuestas found in Quebec. There is only one narrow breach in these fortifications at the extreme southwest end, called \\"Le Goulet\\" (French meaning \\"narrows\\" or \\"bottleneck\\"), which is a cataclinal valley long, wide and fringed by cliffs high. A large volume of water surges through it with the rise and fall of the tides, creating water level differences of about . Consequently, this passage does not freeze in the winter. The eastern shore rises more gradually and is largely Canadian Shield rock, overlain in many places by basalt. Several large rivers enter Richmond Gulf in boisterous rapids or sheer falls (e.g. Clearwater River). Point Pamiallualuk is a narrow spur of rock that juts out some 2 km into Hudson Bay, just north of Le Goulet. Here, the north-flowing tidal current of Hudson Bay collides with weaker counter-current to produce a lot of agitation, which is further enhanced by the strong wind. On the south shore, there are the remnants of an abandoned Hudson's Bay Company trading post, called Fort Richmond, which operated from 1750 to 1759 and from 1921 to 1927.Hudson's Bay Company Archives Name and history Richmond Gulf is just north of the Little Whale River In 1743 the Hudson's Bay Company ordered its post at Fort Albany, Ontario to explore the whole east coast of Hudson Bay, an area rarely visited because it was barren and produced little fur. In 1744, Thomas Mitchell, captain of a HBC ship entered the lake and named it \\"Sir Atwell's Lake\\", most likely in honour of HBC Deputy Governor Sir Atwell Lake, whose surname \\"Lake\\" became a source of confusion. Mitchell also recorded that same year the Cree name \\"Winipeq\\" for this location. The map of William Coats (1749) identified the lake under the Cree name \\"Artiwinipeck\\" and in English as \\"Sir Atwell's Lake\\". Later on this body of water would be given several other names, particularly \\"Winipeke Bay\\", \\"Hazard Gulf\\", \\"Gulf of Richmond,\\" and \\"Richmond Bay\\" until the Geography Commission of Canada accepted Richmond Gulf in 1905. The reason for this choice is not clear: it may refer to the Duke of Richmond or the name of Thomas Mitchell's small vessel. In 1962, the Quebec Government decided to give French names to places in the northern Quebec and changed the name to \\"Lac Guillaume-Delisle\\", in honour of renowned cartographer and First Royal Geographer of France, Guillaume Delisle (1675-1726). Arthur Morton, \\"A History of Western Canada\\", no date but some time after 1937, page 229 In 1749 the HBC ordered Fort Albany to build a post on the east side of the Bay. Since the loss of Fort-Rupert trade on the east side had been done by small ships from Fort Albany and most of it was confined to the forested country well south of Richmond Gulf. The reason for the new post is not clear but it may have been due to rumors of non-HBC traders planning to enter the Bay. In 1750 Captain Coates and John Potts built Fort Richmond on an island known as Factory Island off the south shore of the inlet. Traces of copper were found on the Little Whale River just to the south. A house was built on that river for miners and a small whaling operation, but the mine produced nothing of value. Since the area produced little fur the post was closed in 1759. Some time during this period a group of Eskimos came to the Little Whale River post, found it occupied only by a boy, plundered the post and carried off the boy. Fort Richmond responded by seizing two Eskimos in the hope of exchanging them for the boy. In fact the boy had been murdered. Since the two sides did not know each other's languages the hostages may not have understood what was being done to them. The hostages grabbed two guns and used them as bludgeons against some HBC people. Since the HBC men knew that the guns were loaded they shot down the two Eskimos. Morton claims that this is the only case where the HBC shed native blood. Flora and fauna The many rivers flowing into Richmond Gulf make its water brackish but a healthy habitat for brook trout and whitefish, beluga and seal. Many species of birds, such as common loons, eider ducks and peregrine falcons, find summer shelter and nest here. There are few scattered black spruce and larch in the surrounding tundra. The area has a flora of more than 415 vascular plant species, of which 65% (271 species) can be found on the so-called Hybrid Archipelago within the Gulf.Deshaye, J. et Morisset, P.

Carlisle to be Chief of the Revenue Marine Division of the Department of the Treasury. Shoemaker was noted for his leadership in gaining improvements in the retirement system for officers in the Revenue Cutter Service and for leading the service at a time when there were many engineering improvements made in the construction of vessels used by the service. During his tenure he worked successfully with three different Secretaries of the Treasury as an appointee to improve the personnel standards and the vessels used by the service. Although he was never formally known as Commandant, he is recognized today as the second Commandant of the Coast Guard.Commandants, \\"Traditions of the United States Coast Guard\\" Early life and education Shoemaker was born in Iowa Territory on 27 March 1841. His father, William R. Shoemaker was an officer in the ordnance department of the U.S. Army and moved his family from one post to another many times during his army career. As a child, Charles Shoemaker was educated at home by members of his family and he became adept at mathematics. At 17, Shoemaker received an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy from Miguel Otero, the congressional delegate from New Mexico Territory. At the end of three years, he resigned from the academy and was commissioned as a third lieutenant in the Revenue Cutter Service on 20 November 1860.\\"Revenue Marine's New Chief\\", The New York Times, March 20, 1895, NewYorkTimes.comNoble (1990), p 66King, pp 77-78 Career His first assignment was aboard the USRC Lewis Cass stationed at Mobile, Alabama. In the days leading up to the Civil War his commanding officer, Captain James J. Morrison, resigned his commission, turned the cutter over to Alabama state authorities and left Shoemaker to lead his officers and men back to Union territory. He served on several revenue cutters guarding the Port Of New York until 4 April 1864 when he resigned his commission to go into private business. Shoemaker was re-commissioned a third lieutenant on 25 June 1868 and promoted to a second lieutenant on 12 March 1872 serving at various stations on the Atlantic coast. In 1875, he was serving on , homeported at New Bedford, Massachusetts until he was assigned the duties of assistant inspector of the U.S. Life-Saving Service at New York City.Register of the Commissioned Officers of the United States Revenue Marine, to April 1, 1875\\", p 20, Coast Guard Historical Documents, U.S. Coast Guard Historians Office In 1876 he was appointed assistant inspector of the Third Life Saving District of the U.S. Life-Saving Service and while serving in that billet was promoted to first lieutenant on 25 March 1878. In 1878, Shoemaker was transferred to the office of Sumner I. Kimball, then the Chief of the Revenue Marine Bureau and was assigned investigating duties and heard complaints against keepers at all Life-Saving Service stations. In 1880, he was assigned to investigate the sinking of the British barque M & S Henderson near the Pea Island Life-Saving Station. After taking statements from the station crew and survivors of the shipwreck, Shoemaker concluded that the surfman on watch had been negligent as a lookout and that the station's keeper had lied under oath. Both were dismissed and Shoemaker appointed Richard Etheridge, a black surfman as the new keeper. Etheridge was the first black keeper of a life saving station and was permitted to have an all black crew on the recommendation of Shoemaker; a situation that lasted until 1947 when the station was disestablished.Noble (1994), pp 52-53 Shoemaker was assigned as executive officer on the USRC Seward in 1882 which at the time patrolled the Gulf Coast and was homeported at Bay Saint Louis, Mississippi. In 1885 he was once again detailed to the USLSS, first as an assistant inspector of the Third District and later as inspector of all districts except the Twelfth district on the Pacific coast. During this assignment, he located and obtained sites for stations, conducted 300 investigations and brought serious charges against four assistant superintendents of the service. In April 1891 he was assigned as commanding officer of USRC Washington at the Port of New York. After shifting Washington to Philadelphia in 1893, he assumed command of the newly commissioned USRC Hudson in Philadelphia and returned to New York for harbor patrol duty.Canney, p 51 =Chief of Revenue Cutter Service= USRC Manning, one of several cutters built during Shoemaker's tenure as Commandant. On 19 March 1895, Secretary of the Treasury, John Griffin Carlisle appointed Shoemaker to replace Leonard G. Shepard as Chief of the Revenue Cutter Division and promoted him to senior captain.\\"Charles F. Shoemaker\\", U.S. Coast Guard Historian's Office Improvements in service retirement As a result of Secretary Carlisle's and predecessor Shepard's efforts, legislation passed during March 1895 allowed Shoemaker to place 39 disabled officers that had been on active duty since the Civil War on a retired list, thus giving younger officers a chance at promotion. Since retirement practices of the period were non-existent, so many long serving officers were kept on active duty status well beyond their ability to actually serve effectively because of age and health related issues. Because the number of officers in the RCS was limited by Congressional legislation, this caused senior officers to serve in multiple billets and junior officers oftentimes had to serve in billets that required a senior officer, but they couldn't be promoted or paid the senior officer's pay. The legislation of March 1895 allowed the Chief of the Revenue Cutter Division to take steps to retire the disabled officers at half pay; in turn opening the ranks to younger qualified officers. This helped officer morale of the Revenue Cutter Service. Unfortunately it only affected those officers that were on active duty and incapacitated at the time the legislation was enacted so it was not a permanent solution.King, pp 73‚Äì77 Both Shoemaker and Carlisle continued to push for retirement reforms for officer corps, asking Congress to approve retirement at three-quarters pay any officer that had reached the age of 64 or had served for thirty years and declared physically or mentally disqualified for duty by a medical officer. Lyman Gage, who succeeded Carlisle as Secretary of the Treasury, called for enlisted men injured in the line of duty to be included on a pension list; Shoemaker endorsed this reform also. Congress didn't take action on legislation allowing this to occur until the Overland Relief Expedition of 1897-1898 and the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War brought public attention to the Revenue Cutter Service. By 1901, the service faced a shortage of qualified officers once more because of the temporary nature of the 1895 retirement law; the officer ranks were again filled with the aged and infirm and lieutenants had to fill billets that would have normally been reserved for a captain.King, p 124 Finally, at the urging of both Gage and Shoemaker, Congress passed Senate Bill 1025 on 12 April 1902 that recognized the discrepancies in the treatment of Revenue Cutter Service officers versus officers in the other services: By 30 June 1902, the service had retired, under the new law, nine captains, and five chief engineers because of age and one chief engineer, one third lieutenant and two assistant engineers because of disability; thus opening up opportunities for promotion for the lower ranks. New cutter construction Building on the foundation laid by Shepard, Shoemaker oversaw the acquisition of new steel hulled cutters and increased the number of cutters in service including five cutters over 200 feet in length. Older cutters dating back to before the Civil War were retired and newer cutters replaced them, all were designed with steam propulsion.King, pp 78-80 Changes in the RCS School of Instruction Shoemaker was responsible as the new Chief of the Revenue Cutter Service in enlarging the school's training cutter, USRC Salmon P. Chase so that it could accommodate more cadets. The training cutter had no specific homeport and put into various ports to only to re-provision and get mail.King, pp 166-167 During his tenure, Shoemaker acquired the land for Chase to use as a homeport and for repairs at Arundel Cove in Curtis Bay, Maryland. A small two-story building was built for the school as well as a 400-foot pier for the Chase.King, p 171 This site eventually became the service's vessel construction and overhaul facility and today is known as the United States Coast Guard Yard.Yard History, Coast Guard Yard website Retirement and death Upon reaching the statutory retirement age of 64, Shoemaker was placed the Retired List on 27 March 1905. He was succeeded by Senior Captain Worth G. Ross. On 8 May 1908, Shoemaker was promoted to the rank of Captain-Commandant on the Revenue Cutter Service Retired List by Act of Congress.

The S-type asteroid has a rotation period of 5.9 hours and measures approximately in diameter. It was named for the Northeast European region of Karelia.  Orbit and classification  Carelia is a non-family asteroid of the main belt's background population when applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements. It orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.1‚Äì3.0 AU once every 4 years and 1 month (1,485 days; semi- major axis of 2.55 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.16 and an inclination of 8¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. It was first observed at Heidelberg Observatory, extending the body's observation arc by 2 days prior to its official discovery observation at Turku.  Naming  This minor planet was named after the northeastern European region of Karelia, located between the Gulf of Finland and the Russian White Sea.

The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 11.46 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.07.

He was Deputy Chairman of the Financial Services Authority from January 2004 until he resigned on 11 February 2009. He had previously been the chief executive of Halifax Bank until its merger with Bank of Scotland to form HBOS, of which he was Chief Executive until 2006. On 3 December 2012, Crosby was required to appear before Britain's Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards.Financial Times 4 December 2012 Crosby was knighted for services to the financial industry in 2006, but offered to renounce his knighthood in 2013 following the official report into the collapse of HBOS. His knighthood was formally cancelled and annulled on 6 June 2013. Early life Crosby was born in Leeds. He was educated at the Lancaster Royal Grammar School between 1967 and 1974. After leaving the school, he continued his studies in mathematics at Brasenose College, Oxford. Early career Crosby joined financial services company Scottish Amicable (acquired in 1997 by Prudential plc) in 1977. After qualifying as a Fellow of the Faculty of Actuaries in 1980, he was a founding director of J Rothschild Assurance in 1991, which went on to become wealth manager St. James's Place plc. HBoS Crosby joined the Halifax bank in 1994 as Managing Director of Halifax Life. Five years later, he became the chief executive of Halifax plc, and in 2001 Crosby became the first chief executive of the newly formed HBOS Group after overseeing the merger between Halifax plc and the Bank of Scotland. In early 2006 Crosby resigned after seven years as chief executive leaving HBOS as the fourth largest bank in the United Kingdom in terms of market capitalisation. His position was taken by \\"his young prot√©g√©\\" Andy Hornby in July 2006. In April 2013, the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards assigned the primary responsibility for the collapse of HBOS to Crosby, along with Dennis Stevenson and Andy Hornby. The commission urged the regulator to ban all three men from the industry. Financial Services Authority Crosby was appointed in January 2004 by HM Treasury as a non-Executive Director of the Financial Services Authority whilst still CEO of HBOS. In November 2007 he became Deputy Chair of the FSA, and in February 2009 he resigned this role. During a session of the Treasury Select Committee of the House of Commons on 10 February 2009, it was alleged that Sir James had ignored warnings by its former head of Group Regulatory Risk, Paul Moore, relating to risky business practices. Moore had predicted that HBOS's rapid growth left it vulnerable to a large number of borrower defaults. In 2005 the whistleblower Moore was sacked by Crosby, with Moore quoted as saying that Crosby wrote \\"The decision (to sack Moore) was mine and mine alone.\\" Moore related the key issues in his statement: ::2.12 When I was Head of Group Regulatory Risk at HBOS, I certainly knew that the bank was going too fast (and told them), had a cultural indisposition to challenge (and told them) and was a serious risk to financial stability (what the FSA call \\"Maintaining Market Confidence\\") and consumer protection (and told them). ::2.13 I told the Board they ought to slow down but was prevented from having this properly minuted by the CFO. I told them that their sales culture was significantly out of balance with their systems and controls. ::2.14 I was told by the FSA, the Chairman of the Audit Committee and others that I was doing a good job. ::2.15 Notwithstanding this I was dismissed by the CEO (he wrote that it was \\"...his decision and his alone\\"). I sued HBOS for unfair dismissal under the whistle blowing legislation. Ironically, I was also the \\"Good Practice Manager\\" for whistle blowing purposes at HBOS but could hardly report my case to myself! On 11 February 2009 Crosby resigned from his post at the Financial Services Authority, which BBC News Business Editor Robert Peston says he understood was to protect the FSA from controversy. The FSA released a statement late on 11 February 2009 that it had concerns about HBOS before the Moore resignation, a statement which raises yet more questions about the regulation of HBOS. A central problem concerns conflict of interests between board members of the FSA and the companies it is trying to regulate. However, Moore has received support from a former member of his team at HBOS, Anthony Smith, who on 17 February 2009, accused HBOS of \\"dumbing down\\". Crosby was further criticised when, following the takeover of HBOS by Lloyds, HBOS was responsible for annual losses of ¬£10 billion, in part due to write-downs made because Lloyds' accounting standards are much more conservative than those of HBOS. Conservative Shadow Chancellor George Osborne said that the government's bank bailout money had been wiped out by the HBOS losses, saying that \\"HBOS bankers like James Crosby bear a heavy responsibility\\". Links with HM Treasury On 11 July 2006, Crosby was appointed by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, to lead the Government's Public Private Forum on Identity Management, a scheme designed to counter problems such as identity fraud. Also in 2006, Crosby received a knighthood for services to the financial industry. In April 2008, Crosby was appointed by Chancellor Alastair Darling to head up a Working Group of mortgage industry experts to advise the Government on how to improve the functioning of the mortgage market. Other roles In 2006, Crosby was appointed to lead Gordon Brown's Identity Assurance review.http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080910140419/http://www.hm- treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/identity_management/identity_management_index.cfm Crosby is a non-executive director of television company ITV, and a trustee of charity Cancer Research UK.  Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards On 3 December 2012 Crosby was required to appear before the British Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards over his role as Chief Executive during the Collapse of HBOS.

He was a fellow of Jesus College, Oxford for 37 years, and was in charge there of the last college laboratory at the University of Oxford. Education and early life Chapman was born in Wells, Norfolk but moved with his family to Manchester and attended Manchester Grammar School. He then went to Christ Church, Oxford, obtaining degrees in chemistry (1893, 1st class) and physics (1894, 2nd class). Personal life Campman was by reputation something of a scientific recluse, difficult to dislodge from his laboratory, although he did play a full part in University and College affairs. Away from his teaching and research, he was reserved and somewhat eccentric, but enjoyed golf, cycling and walking. He married one of his research students, Muriel Holmes (a member of the university's Society of Oxford Home-Students) in 1918 and together they had a daughter, Ruth. He died from cancer at his home in Oxford in 1958. Career Chapman was science master at Giggleswick School for a time before becoming a member of staff at the University of Manchester. In 1907, Jesus College, Oxford appointed him as fellow and tutor in charge of its new teaching and research laboratory. Chapman ran this until his retirement in 1944; the laboratory, the last college-run laboratory in the university, closed in 1947. Chapman was also vice-principal of the college (1926-44). Research Although Chapman took a keen interest in his students, research was his main priority. Chapman had a particular interest in the photochemical reaction of hydrogen and chlorine, establishing that minute traces of impurities caused unexpected consequences. He suggested the steady state hypothesis in 1913. He discovered that the interruption of light by a rotating sector caused the rate of the reaction to vary with the frequency of the sector and, in 1926, he was the first to apply this theory to measure the 'mean life' of a reaction intermediate. Other areas of interest were the theory of detonation in gases (the subject of an important paper that Chapman published in 1899,Chapman, David Leonard (1899) \\"On the rate of explosion in gases,\\" Philosophical Magazine, series 5, vol. 47, pages 90-104. with reliable calculations of detonation speeds; the theory is still known as the Chapman- Jouget treatment) and the distribution of ions at a charged surface (with the name of the Gouy-Chapman layer being given to the surface layer that he envisaged).

Latterly residing in London, he was best known for his leadership during the 1957 Alexandra Bus Boycott, one of the most successful single-issue campaigns undertaken during Apartheid.As recognised by, for example: Anthony Sampson, Ruth First and Chief Albert Luthuli. Political activism and professional life Mokonyane was born in 1930 in Mothlabaneng, near Mahwelereng, in Limpopo province. After being expelled from boarding school in Polokwane for being argumentative about politics and the need for equality for all races, he moved to Alexandra Township in Johannesburg, living in a house owned by his father, to attend school in Soweto. He later majored in economics and philosophy at the University of Witwatersrand. During his time at school, Mokonyane joined the Society of Young Africans (SOYA), a group aligned to the Non-European Unity Movement. He later left SOYA to join the Movement For a Democracy of Content. He met and discussed with many anti-apartheid leaders, including Nelson Mandela (African National Congress) and Robert Sobukwe (Pan Africanist Congress). When the 1957 Alexandra Bus Boycott was announced, in protest against the local bus company's attempt to raise its fares, Mokonyane joined the boycott committee as Publicity Secretary and then later as the Secretary of the Organizing Committee. He was frequently arrested and imprisoned during the campaign against the pass laws. In 1960, after the Sharpeville massacre, he was served with a Banishment Order from Alexandra township and fled from South Africa to the United Kingdom. He was appointed to a research position at the School of Oriental and African Studies in the University of London. He then studied for a law degree at the University of London, obtained a higher degree in human rights at the University of Kent and researched in planning law at the University of Wales.

The Big Sell-Out (1994) is a vehement critique of what Mokonyane saw as a contemptible failure by the Communist Party of South Africa and the African National Congress (and others) to translate the removal of Apartheid into improving the lot of the masses.The Big Sell Out by the Communist Party of South Africa and the African National Congress (London, Nakong Ya Rena, 1994).

History The President Hotel was built and completed in 1926 by Niagara Falls businessman Frank A. Dudley and operated by the United Hotels Company. The hotel was built in a construction boom that also saw the erection of the nearby Mainstreet Theater, Midland Theatre, and Kansas City Power and Light Building. At the beginning of 1935 a man, using an assumed name at the time but later identified as Artemus Ogletree, was found severely assaulted in room 1046 after a two-day stay marked by odd behavior and interactions with a mysterious \\"Don\\"; he later died in the hospital. The case remains unsolved. The hotel closed its doors in 1980. It later underwent a $45.5 million restoration by developer Ron Jury and reopened in 2005 as the Hilton President Kansas City. The hotel is managed by Jury Hotel Group of Overland Park, Kansas. The hotel‚Äôs General Manager is Philip Strnad. Additional renovations were completed in 2017. These renovations included all guest rooms and meeting rooms. The acclaimed Presidential Suite, and Reagan suites were renovated in 2019.

It was discovered on 11 February 1977, by the staff of the Felix Aguilar Observatory at El Leoncito Complex in San Juan, Argentina. The asteroid was named after South American astronomer Reinaldo Carestia.  Orbit and classification  Carestia orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.5‚Äì3.9 AU once every 5 years and 9 months (2,104 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.21 and an inclination of 21¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at Crimea-Simeis in 1939, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 38 years prior to its discovery.  Physical characteristics  The carbonaceous C-type asteroid is one of the darkest main-belt asteroids known. = Rotation period = In September 2008, a rotational lightcurve was obtained from photometric observations made by Italian astronomer Federico Manzini at the Stazione Astronomica di Sozzago (), Italy. It rendered it a rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.13 in magnitude (). Previously, a fragmentary lightcurve from the 1990s, gave a shorter period of 7.1 hours with an amplitude of 0.25 (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the space-based surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid's surface has an exceptionally low albedo between 0.012 and 0.051. Combined with the observation's corresponding absolute magnitude, this results in an inferred diameter of 42.9 to 64.6 kilometers. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.02 and a diameter of 59.3 kilometers.  Naming  This minor planet was named after of South American astronomer Reinaldo Augusto Carestia (1932‚Äì1993), professor of positional astronomy at UNSJ's School of Topography, publisher of 5 star catalogs, and member of the National Committee of Scientific and Technological Research of Chile. For decades, he worked with the Repsold Meridian Circle at the discovering Felix Aguilar Observatory. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 19 October 1994 ().

She is a Democrat. Personal Born in Minnesota, Mrs. Seefeldt earned her undergraduate degree from St. Scholastica College (1956) and did graduate work at Boston University. With Robert A. Seefeldt, her husband, she moved to Prince William County in 1970. They reside in Woodbridge and Chincoteague, Virginia. She is a mother and grandmother who gives stain removal advice and reads for pleasure. Board of Supervisors Kathleen Seefeldt was first elected to the Prince William Board of County Supervisors in 1975, and served as the Occoquan District Supervisor from 1976 to 1991. In 1991, she was elected the first at-large Chairman of the Board. Previously, the Chairman had been elected by the Board from among its membership. When Seefeldt took office as Chairman in 1992, she assumed the Board's eighth seat, the first time the Board had grown since it was enlarged to seven Supervisors in 1967. During her tenure on the Board, she was a fairly strong advocate for greater growth and development in the County, which was still very rural when she first entered office in 1976. She was instrumental in the construction of the Prince William Parkway, a stretch of which bears her name. The Parkway, begun in 1990, provided a major arterial thoroughfare connecting the county's eastern and western ends, beginning at Interstate 95 near Woodbridge and continuing on through Dale City to Manassas. Later additions to the Parkway included an eastern extension providing a link-up with US Route 1 and a western extension that connected with Interstate 66 and those parts of the county west of Manassas. In 1988, Seefeldt became involved in a battle between the National Park Service and real estate development company Hazel/Peterson over the proposed construction of a large, regional shopping mall near the Manassas National Battlefield Park. Seefeldt expressed concerns over the environmental and traffic impact of the proposed development, but supported the mall as a strong economic development tool, one that might compete with the large, popular, and profitable Tysons Corner Center in neighboring Fairfax County. Relations between Seefeldt and the Park Service soon deteriorated over longstanding county government concerns regarding the Park Service's stewardship of the Manassas Battlefield and the Park Service's opposition to the new mall. Ultimately, the mall was never built. Mrs. Seefeldt lost reelection to a third term in 1999 to Republican Sean Connaughton who successfully targeted her as the architect of the County's burgeoning growth. Development that was once welcome had brought greater traffic and placed a strain on county services, fueling voter disenchantment in a historic election; the Democrats lost control of the Virginia General Assembly for the first time in a century. In Prince William County, once the Democrats' bastion in Northern Virginia, the County Sheriff, Commonwealth's Attorney, and two members of the Board of Supervisors were the only Democrats left in County Government. Seefeldt was the last Democrat to chair Prince William County's government, despite the county's gradual and increasing return to the Democratic fold in presidential and gubernatorial elections until Ann Wheeler twenty years later won in the 2019 Virginia elections a Democratic Party majority of 5-3 on the County Board‚Äîthe first time since Seefeldt's departure that Democrats held a majority on the governing board of Virginia's third largest local government. Prince William Parkway In April 2001, a portion of the Prince William Parkway was dedicated as the \\"Kathleen K. Seefeldt Parkway\\". The portion named after Seefeldt stretches from I-95 to the intersection of Liberia and Fairview Avenues near Manassas; this segment is the original Parkway and was completed entirely during Seefeldt's tenure as Chairman. Mrs. Seefeldt was a key force in securing the parkway, and its unusual (for Virginia), mix of local with state financing. Stone monuments to Seefeldt can be found at the intersection of the Parkway and Davis Ford Road (no longer an arterial road) and again at the intersection of the Parkway and the border with the City of Manassas.

It is 360 km north of the state capital, Sydney, 66 km south of Walcha in the Walcha Shire local government area. A sealed road, Thunderbolts Way, is about three hundred metres to the south of Nowendoc and provides links to the south and north. History In 1836 William Telfer marked a tree line from Gloucester through Giro on the Barnard River, over Hungry Hill to Nowendoc and on to Ogunbil via Whites Sugarloaf. The Australian Agricultural Company (AACo) set up stations and resting places for their travelling sheep along this route to be known as the ‚ÄòPeel Line‚Äô. During the years 1840 to 1845 Nowendoc was one of the AACo outstations for their sheep.Donald, J.Kay, Exploring the North Coast and New England, Kangaroo Press, Kenthurst, 1978, In 1857 John Hall surveyed 39 allotments to define the village of Nowendoc. Thomas Laurie discovered alluvial gold there in 1872 and by 1873 there were about 100 people camping at Township Spur. By 1945 nearly all mining has ceased. Some dairying was done during the earlier years of settlement. The name Nowendoc comes from a Worimi term meaning 'rough ground'. The village has a cemetery, church, school, sports ground, store, police station, a New South Wales Rural Fire Service station and community hall. The store perhaps temporarily, ceased trading in March 2012. There is also a small motel on the edge of the village on the Taree road. A post office operated intermittently from 1861 to 1979. The completion of the telephone line to Walcha in 1921 reduced the isolation of the area. Rural electricity was supplied during 1964-5 to those who made the contribution of ¬£248/10/- towards the cost of connection. The local Uniting Church was officially opened in 1976. At the 2016 census, Nowendoc and the surrounding area had a population of 146.Australian Bureau of Statistics (27 June 2017). (State Suburb)\\". 2016 Census QuickStats. Retrieved 29 June 2018. The main industries are beef cattle breeding and timber. Nowendoc is a centre for those keen on bushwalking, fishing and similar activities and lies near the top of the escarpment that contains the bulk of the Barrington Tops National Park. Many scenic walks and drives can be easily accessed from Nowendoc with the Nowendoc National Park nearby. Tennis, football and cricket are popular sports that enjoyed by residents. An annual rodeo is held on the Nowendoc sports ground. = Manhunt = In late 2011 and early 2012 Nowendoc featured heavily in the media, as it was the base for a NSW Police manhunt for Malcolm Naden, who had been wanted by police for some six years. Up to 90 police were based in the village at the height of the operation. In late March 2012 Naden was captured by NSW Police about 30 km west of Gloucester.

It can also be regarded as one of the earliest structural changes observed in the cell. The GTP-binding protein Rac is the regulator of this membrane ruffling. Changes in the Polyphosphoinositide metabolism and changes in Ca2+ level of the cell may also play an important role. A number of actin-binding and organizing proteins localize to membrane ruffles and potentially target to transducing molecules. Characteristic feature of migrating cells Membrane ruffling is a characteristic feature of many actively migrating cells. When the membrane is unable to attach to the substrate, the membrane protrusion is recycled back into the cell. The ruffling of membranes is thought to be controlled by a group of enzymes known as Rho GTPases, specifically RhoA, Rac1 and cdc42. Bacterial infection Some bacteria such as enteropathogenic E. coli and enterohemorrhagic E. coli can induce membrane ruffling by secreting toxins via the type three secretion system and modifying the host cytoskeleton. Such toxins include EspT, Map, and SopE, which mimic RhoGEF and activate endogenous Rho GTPases to manipulate actin polymerisation in the infected cell.

Unlike many hair pins, which are usually small and quite simple, hair sticks are often more elaborate and decorative, and feature jeweled or carved designs that make them stand out as pieces of luxury jewelry. The price of hair sticks varies greatly depending on the style, materials, and craftsmanship - the cheapest pairs of plastic hair sticks can cost less than a dollar, while a single, hand-crafted hair stick by an artist can cost over two hundred dollars. Historical use Hair sticks have been in use for thousands of years, and have been found in cultures of the Ancient Egyptians, Romans, and Greeks. Although some of these have been jeweled, luxury items, such as the gold hair sticks of Egypt,About.com A brief overview of modern and historical hair sticks more common, wooden hair sticks have also been found in cultures such as Rome,HistoryForKids.org , Roman Clothing suggesting that they were in wide use amongst people regardless of their financial standing. However, the most influential culture on modern hair sticks has been Japanese, and in particular the use of decorative Japanese Kanzashi. Although many modern hair sticks draw more on the elaborate approach to the design of Kanzashi more than on the simpler designs for functional pins, Kanzashi are used within a far more rigid and traditional environment. Kanzashi are frequently floral in design, especially those dictated by the changing of the seasons and used by Geisha (see full Kanzashi entry for more details). Modern use Hand-crafted, purpose-made jeweled hair sticks that add colour and flair to hairstyles have overtaken the use of plainer styles, and have become a more popular hairstyle embellishment. Because of the wide availability of components for the crafting of hair sticks, making home-made hair sticks has also become a popular trend. Many people enjoy making their own pieces using the blank sticks that can be found online, and buying pins, crystals and beads from various online suppliers.

The team play in the Ardal Leagues South East, tier 3 of the Welsh football pyramid. They are based in the town of Caldicot, Monmouthshire and have a long running rivalry with nearby team based 5.8 miles away, Chepstow Town AFC. History Caldicot Town AFC has its beginning back in 1953. Then, with voluntary help from the community the necessary funds were raised and after much hard work two pitches were laid at King George V playing fields. The 'green wooden hut' was erected to serve as changing rooms with a small shower area. The club then entered the East Gwent League. In the 1963‚Äì64 season a second side was formed to play in the East Gwent Division 2. Throughout the 1960s season the club was successful in winning the East Gwent Division 1 and 2 ‚Äì the Watkins Shield ‚Äì the Benevolent Cup ‚Äì The Gill Cup and the Argus Shield. In 1966 the Senior side joined the Monmouthshire Senior League Division, now known as the Gwent County League. During the late 1970s and early 80s the club won the Gwent Senior League Division 1, on two occasions, as well as winning the Senior Cup and Amateur Cup. In December 1975 the original Clubhouse was built in Jubilee Way. This incorporated a small bar, a lounge, changing rooms and shower facilities. Since then the clubhouse has been modified and upgraded and now boasts four players changing rooms, a referees room, shower and toilet facilities, a large function room, a new lounge, a well equipped kitchen and outside patio areas complete with bench seats. 1979 saw the formation of Caldicot Town Junior Section. This gave local boys the opportunity to play competitive football at both local and County Level. It is also a source of future players for the senior teams. In 1986, the club achieved its ambition of election into the Welsh Football League. Much hard work by many people had to be done to achieve this goal. The ground had to be enclosed with a high perimeter fence and barrier put up around the pitch itself. Also the changing facilities had to reach the high standards set by the League. The playing fields are not forgotten and are re-seeded and maintained each year. We also have covered spectator accommodation plus excellent floodlights. As a result of these facilities the club is regularly requested to hold representative games at Local and County Level. We have now enjoyed 24 seasons in the Welsh League, winning the Division 2 Championship 1989‚Äì90 and as runners up in Division 1 gained promotion to the top Division 1990/91. 1996 was a bad year for the Welsh League side with poor performances leading to relegation to Division Two. A further setback came at the end of the 1999‚Äì00 season when we relegated to Division Three. The Season 2001‚Äì02 saw us miss out on promotion on goal difference, but our fortune was to change 2002‚Äì03 season when we pipped Caerau Ely to promotion by 1 point after they lost their last game of the season away to Seven Sisters. Season 2006‚Äì07 saw Caldicot return to the Welsh League 1st Division, finishing third behind champions Garw and runners- up Cambrian & Clydach. Season 2007‚Äì08 was Caldicot's first year back in the 1st division and should be hailed as a success as the team finished in a solid 11th place with the players competing well with the top sides. The first team also won the Gwent Senior Cup when they defeated Cwmbran Town in the semi- final and then Cwmbran Celtic in the final by a 1‚Äì0 scoreline. Caldicot struggled in their second season back in 2008‚Äì09 and finished 14th, having topped the table up till Christmas. Season 2009‚Äì10 saw a return to management for Jason Pritchard, who shared duties with Simon Wetter. The side had their best season for some years, finishing fourth in the league. They were later relegated in 2010‚Äì11 to re-enter the second division for the 2011‚Äì12 season. Season 2014-15 saw Caldicot miss out on promotion placed Risca United in third place by one point. Another fourth placed finish for Caldicot meant they again missed out on promotion back to the second division after five years of trying to reach a third spot saw them maintain their position in the third division. Season 2015-16 finally saw Caldicot promoted back to the second division after the six year wait. Caldicot beat West End away 5-2 to secure the title after their rivals Undy Athletic missed out on the chance by not winning their game on the final day, allowing Caldicot the top spot by two points. Mark Williams management, successfully managed 24 wins in 30 games reaching back to the second division. Caldicot were joined by Undy Athletic and Cwmbran Celtic on their promotion. Season 2016-17 saw Caldicot re-entered the third tier after a difficult first season back in the second tier. They placed 15th missing safety by a clear 10 points. Caldicot only managed to get 7 wins in 30 games in their first season back meaning they were relegated back to Welsh League Division Two as they were joined by Risca United.

He is best known for competing in various independent promotions, the most notable being Ring of Honor, Pro Wrestling ZERO1-MAX / Pro Wrestling Zero1 and AWA Superstars of Wrestling / Wrestling Superstars Live. Professional wrestling career =Debut (2003-2004)= After training under Steve Corino, Ricky Landell made his professional wrestling debut on November 1, 2003 where he wrestled fellow debuting wrestler Alex Law to a ten-minute draw. After both debuted, Landell and Law began teaming with each other to compete in several tag team matches for Pro Wrestling WORLD-1 beginning in 2004. Following a six-man tag team where he, Law and their partner Greg Spitz lost to the Extreme Horsemen (C.W. Anderson, Justin Credible and Simon Diamond) on April 10, Landell was inducted into the Horsemen as its newest member. In mid-2004, Landell, less than a year into his career, made an excursion to Japan to receive further training and briefly trained under Tatsuhito Takaiwa while touring with Shinya Hashimoto's Pro Wrestling ZERO1-MAX. Landell made his debut for the promotion on July 9, where he competed in his first championship match at the legendary Korakuen hall in Tokyo, Japan. He lost to Tommy Wilson in a cage match to determine who would win the vacant BS American Championship. The following day, Landell teamed with Wilson to defeat Fuyuki Takahashi and Shinsuke Z Yamagasa in a tag team cage match. =Independent circuit and championship success (2005-2008)= Beginning in 2005, Landell made his Ring of Honor debut on January 15 at their event It All Begins, where he and four other men lost to Roderick Strong in a four-on-one handicap match. He returned to the promotion on February 19 at their event Do Or Die IV, where he teamed with his old partner Alex Law to defeat Anthony Franco and Davey Andrews. On March 12, Landell made his third and final ROH appearance as he and Law lost to The Ring Crew Express at the event Back To Basics. On January 29, 2006, Landell defeated Masato Tanaka to win Pro Wrestling WORLD-1's Heavyweight Championship, giving him the first championship of his career. Upon becoming champion, Landell became the face of promotion and would go on to defend the title in WORLD-1 in various Independent Promotions around the country, including a notable victory over his trainer and mentor Steve Corino on April 9 in Pottstown, PA. Landell would ultimately become the longest reigning champion in the promotion's history, as he held the title for 1279 days with his reign only ending due to his retirement from wrestling in early 2009. Landell would continue his championship success as he teamed with Corino to win the AWA Superstars of Wrestling World Tag Team Championship on June 14, 2006 after defeating Team MackTion (Kirby Mack and T.J. Mack). Despite holding two titles simultaneously, Landell won a battle royale on July 22 to become the number one contender for the AWA Superstars of Wrestling Heavyweight Championship. Later on that day, he wrestled then-champion Ric Converse for the title in a losing effort. Landell and Corino would later lose the World Tag Team Titles to Converse and Xsiris on March 23, 2007. Landell soon began competing more frequently for AWA Superstars of Wrestling, becoming a travelling brand talent for the promotion, competing nationally for various AWA territorial promotions as well as the home company. He became the promotion's first United States Champion on June 13, 2007 after defeating Zach Gowen in Rochester, MN. The win also simultaneously made him Pro Wrestling ZERO1-MAX's new United States Heavyweight Champion due to the AWA and ZERO1-MAX splitting from each other. His reign with the AWA's version of the title ended on March 29, 2008 after the title was deactivated and Landell became the first Fighting World Champion of the now-renamed Wrestling Superstars Live following a victory over Keith Walker. On August 13, Landell lost the Fighting World Title to Walker in a rematch. Aside from WORLD-1 and WSL, Landell returned to the now-renamed Pro Wrestling Zero1 in early May 2008 and defeated Sterling James Keenan on June 1 to win the promotion's United States Heavyweight Title for the second time. He would go on to hold the title for over two months before losing it to King Kaluha on August 22. After several attempts, Landell finally won the WSL World Heavyweight Championship on October 11 in Indianapolis, IN in front of 3000 fans at the famed Indianapolis Speedrome after defeating \\"The Living Legend\\" Larry Zbyszko, whom he had previously lost to in a title match back on May 3 when the championship was under the AWA Superstars banner. =Retirement= On February 21, 2009, Landell lost the World Heavyweight Title to Keith Walker in a screw job like finish where afterwards WSL Owner Dale Gagne publicly fired Landell. Soon afterwards, Landell's official Myspace profile page and website were taken down and it was later announced that he had retired from wrestling. His retirement resulted in the Pro Wrestling WORLD-1 Heavyweight Championship being vacated and ending his reign at 1,279 days, the longest reign of any kind in the promotion's history. On June 12, 2011, Landell made what was to be a one-night only return as he wrestled against and lost to Corino at Pro Wrestling WORLD-1's event The Last Stampede. Landell ended up making 2 more appearances for the promotion in 2011 and 2012.

Lucille Kahn in 1925 In the 1920s, Kahn appeared in several productions opposite theatre legends Otis Skinner and Lionel Barrymore, most notably in the David Belasco production of Laugh, Clown, Laugh. In 1927 she married David E. Kahn, a close friend and early supporter of the famous psychic Edgar Cayce. Throughout the 1950s, she played an active role in bringing together proponents of Eastern philosophy, spiritual exploration, and metaphysical development, and her home on E 80th Street in New York became an informal salon for lectures and discussions that included Aldous Huxley, Gerald Heard, and Bill Wilson (founder of Alcoholics Anonymous). In 1958, with the encouragement of Wilson and Heard, and with funding from the Eileen Garrett's Parapsychological Foundation, she helped to organize a group of intellectuals to explore clinical and spiritual potential of LSD-25. Between 1958 and 1960, the so-called \\"Basic Group\\" gathered on a regular basis to take LSD-25 in an intimate but controlled setting. The sessions were held in private homes just outside New York City. A small dose of the drug (75 to 100 micrograms), which was at that time still legally available for research purposes, would be administered to a single subject by an attending physician, Dr. Robert Laidlaw, then chief psychiatrist at Roosevelt Hospital. In addition to the subject and the physician, several other members of the group would be present, both to offer support, take observational notes and occasionally to ask probing questions of the subject during their experience. The subject‚Äôs observations were compiled into written transcripts of the experience, and in most cases were accompanied by audio recordings. After the experience, subjects were asked to write a ‚Äúsubjective report‚Äù reflecting on their experiences. The transcripts and reports were distributed to the various members of the group. Participants in these experiments included Eugene Exman (religion editor for Harper & Brothers), Dr. Garma Chen Chi Chang (respected Buddhist scholar and Bollingen Fellow), and early civil-rights activist and educator Rachel Davis DuBois. Her later life was devoted to promoting the work of Edgar Cayce, through the Association for Research and Enlightenment. She traveled extensively to holy sites, often as part of ARE tours, and once met with the Dalai Lama. She wrote the final chapter of David Kahn's posthumously published memoir, My Life with Edgar Cayce, as well as several articles for ARE publications. Lucille Kahn was the grandmother of contemporary pageant artist, Alex Kahn. Sources *Cheever, Susan.

Specifically the term is used for the transition of developing countries from traditional diets high in cereal and fiber to more Western pattern diets high in sugars, fat, and animal-source food. Historical framework The nutrition transition model was first proposed in 1993 by Barry Popkin, and is the most cited framework in literature regarding the nutrition transition, although it has been subject to some criticism for being overly simplified. Popkin posits that two other historic transitions affect and are affected by nutritional transition. The first is the demographic transition, whereby a pattern of high fertility and high mortality transforms to one of low fertility and low mortality. Secondly, an epidemiological transition occurs, wherein a shift from a pattern of high prevalence of infectious diseases associated with malnutrition, and with periodic famine and poor environmental sanitation, to a pattern of high prevalence of chronic and degenerative diseases associated with urban-industrial lifestyles is shown. These concurrent and dynamically influenced transitions share an emphasis on the ways in which populations move from one pattern to the next. Popkin used five broad patterns to help summarize the nutrition transition model. While these patterns largely appear chronological, it is important to note that they are not restricted to certain periods of human history and still characterize certain geographic and socioeconomic subpopulations. The first pattern is that of collecting food, a characterization of hunter-gatherers, whose diets were high in carbohydrates and low in fat, especially saturated fat. The second pattern is defined by famine, a marked scarcity and reduced variation of the food supply. The third pattern is one of receding famine. Fruits, vegetables, and animal protein consumption increases, and starchy staples become less important in the diet. The fourth pattern is one of degenerative diseases onset by a diet high in total fat, cholesterol, sugar, and other refined carbohydrates and low in polyunsaturated fatty acids and fiber. This pattern is often accompanied by an increasingly sedentary lifestyle. The fifth pattern, and most recently emerging pattern, is characterized by a behavioral change reflective of a desire to prevent or delay degenerative diseases. Recent and rapid changes seen in developing countries from the second and third pattern to the fourth is the common focus of nutrition transition research and desire for policy that would emphasize a healthier overall diet characterizes the shift from the fourth to the fifth pattern. Relation to economic development The nutrition transition has much of its roots in economic factors related to the development of a nation or subpopulations within a nation. It was once believed that current nutrition transition was endemic only to industrialized nations like the United States, but increasing research has indicated that not only is nutrition transition occurring most rapidly in low- and middle-income developing countries, the stress of its effects stands to burden the poorest populations of these countries the most as well. This shift is attributable to many causes. Globalization has played a large role in altering the access and availability of foods in formerly undeveloped nations. Demographic shifts from rural to urban areas are central to this as well as the liberalization of food markets, global food marketing, and the emergence of transnational food companies in developing countries.Hawkes C. \\"Globalization, Food, and Nutrition Transitions.\\" Washington, DC: IFPRI, (2007). All these forces of globalization are creating lifestyle changes that contribute to the nutrition transition. Technological advancements are making previously arduous labor less difficult and thus altering energy expenditure that would have helped offset the caloric increases in the diet. Daily tasks and leisure are also affected by technological advancements and contributing to greater rates of inactivity. The aforementioned increases in calorie are due to increased consumption of edible oils, animal-source foods, caloric sweeteners, accompanied by reduced consumption of grains and fruits and vegetables. These changes play into human biological preferences seen across the world. Socioeconomic factors also play an important role as do cultural values tied to appearance and status. =Globalization and economic factors = The current nutrition transition seen in the emerging markets of Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, North Africa, and urban areas of sub-Saharan Africa is largely a product of globalization. International food trade, investment, commercialization and marketing are drastically impacting the availability of and access to energy- dense, but nutrient-deficient foods causing the aforementioned shift from traditional diet. Another byproduct of globalization has been a marked demographic transition in these countries from rural areas to urban ones. Urban populations are more susceptible to current trends in nutrition transition because of the improved transportation, commercial food distribution and marketing, less labor-intensive-occupations, and changes in household eating habits and structure. The liberalization of food markets has had a drastic effect on consumption patterns across the globe. Liberalization and commercialization of domestic agricultural markets are opening up food trading since this is needed to compete in the world market. This had led to changes in the types of food produced, and increases in amounts of food imported into developing countries, which affects the relative availability and prices of different foods. Food demand is being shaped by increases in income and urbanization. As these rapidly developing nations continue to accrue high incomes per capita, their food spending is increasing as well. They elect to use these higher incomes on more calorically-dense foods that are sweeter and higher in fats. For example, in China, for the same extra dollar of income, an average Chinese person is purchasing higher calorie food today than that person would have done for the same extra yuan in 1990. Rapid urbanization has also shaped food demand globally. The demographic transition from rural areas to urban populations is a well documented byproduct of globalization and technological advancements. This is because agro-food systems have replaced local subsistence farming in many rural areas. The supply of food is directly sculpted by increasing demand in these areas with growing income. Urbanization is increasing access to new foods and therefore altering the supply chain. This is why transnational food companies have grown so rapidly over the past few decades. These companies are making processed and fast foods much cheaper and more widely available through the growth of transnational supermarkets and chain restaurants. Food is not only easier to obtain in urban areas; it is also cheaper and less time-consuming to acquire which creates an imbalance between energy intake and output. Their advertising and promotional strategies have a strong effect on consumer choices and desire. Foreign direct investment is also stimulating processed food sales in these supermarkets by lowering prices and creating incentives for advertising and promotion. A large proportion of this advertising is for energy-dense processed foods and is being directed at children and youth. Technological and transportation advancements are reducing the barriers that once limited global food trade. These techniques are critical to facilitating the production and distribution needed in a global market. Better preservation techniques are helping to reduce waste which contributes to lower prices for consumers. Technology is creating higher yields which also reduce prices. =Lifestyle changes= The forces of globalization are strongly influencing many lifestyle changes in developing countries. Major changes in economic structures from agrarian economies to industrialized economies are reducing physical activity levels in occupations around the world. Even in agricultural work, gas-powered technologies are helping reduce the energy expenditure needed to perform pertinent farming tasks. These reduced activity levels are not just seen in the workplace, but in homes as well. Daily tasks that were once laborious engagements are now much easier with the help of technological advancements, with examples being appliances such as washing machines, refrigerators, and stoves. Also, recent leaps in the efficiency of food production (canning, refrigeration, freezing, and packaging being a few of the most notable) and improvements in cookware, such as the introduction of improved metal stoves which use fossil fuels and microwave ovens, have helped reduce domestic efforts greatly. Leisure is being greatly impacted as well. Activities such as playing sports outside are being replaced with television watching and computer games. Decreasing physical leisure activities can also be contributed to urbanization wherein access to fields needed to play such games as soccer are not available due to such dense populations and their subsequent demand for land. Other important lifestyle changes fueling the nutrition transition relate to the composition of diets. These dietary shifts have been mentioned previously several times but deserve greater scrutiny. Diets rich in legumes, other vegetables, and coarse grains are disappearing in all regions and countries. Taking their place are diets characterized by fat-rich edible and vegetable oils, cheap animal-source foods high in fat and protein, and artificially sweetened foods high in sugar and refined carbohydrates. Consumption of caloric beverages such as soda represented 21% of all calorie intake in Mexico from 1996 to 2002. Processes of globalization that have influenced food markets have made these products much cheaper, flavorful, and easier to produce which has in turn driven up their demand. So while globalization and the accompanying economic development has created higher levels of food security for developing countries, the ongoing trend of eating in a more Western fashion has caused increased rates of adverse health and childhood obesity. =Biopsychosocial forces= The desires for these new diets and lifestyles are very understandable from a biological and psychosocial perspective. For example, humans have an innate preference for sweets dating back to hunter-gatherer populations. These sweets signaled a good source of energy for hunter-gatherers who were not food secure. This same concept also relates to human predisposition for energy-dense fatty foods. These foods were needed to sustain long journeys and provided a safety net for times of famine. Humans also desire to eliminate physical exertion. This can explain the shift to more sedentary lifestyles from occupational, domestic, and leisurely activities that were previously much more physical taxing. Socioeconomic and cultural influences also contribute to lifestyle changes associated with nutrition transition. The transfer of tastes by means of tourism and open food trade has introduced developing nations to foods previously enjoyed only by industrialized countries. Global food advertising and promotion has only further cemented these dietary changes. Additionally some cultures view obese body types in high regard as they relate them to power, beauty and affluence. Several studies suggest that socioeconomic status contributes greatly to nutrition transition wherein there is a lack of healthy food alternatives completely or a lack of affordable healthy food alternatives. Health and economic outcomes While increased food security is a major benefit of global nutrition transition, there are a myriad of coinciding negative health and economic consequences. Rates of obesity are soaring across the world and recent trends suggest that incidences of overnutrition in coming decades will overtake that of undernutrition in the developing world. As well there will be a marked epidemiological shift from infectious disease to degenerative, noncommunicable disease, NCDs in these countries. As it stands now these countries face a unique paradox in having to deal with both over- and undernutrition, a dual burden of malnutrition, that will inevitably be accompanied by both infectious and noncommunicable diseases, a dual burden of disease. The economic impact will be enormous as well. In addition to reduced productivity, the health systems of these countries stand to face a tremendous burden. =Health outcomes= The foremost health outcome of the global nutrition transition will be an increased prevalence of obesity across the world. Obesity prevalence in developing countries increased from 2.3% in 1988 to 19.6% in 1998. Incidences are highest among women and children, indicating health inequities across global populations. Obesity is strongly linked to degenerative, NCDs such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and hypertension. WHO estimates place NCDs as the principal global cause of morbidity and mortality, and global prevalence of chronic diseases is projected to increase substantially over the next 2 decades in developing countries. Between 1990 and 2020, mortality from cardiovascular diseases, CVDs, in developing countries is expected to increase 120% for women and 137% for men compared to 29 and 49% respectively in industrialized countries. In many of the countries facing epidemics of overnutrition, there is still widespread undernutrition. =Double burden of nutrition= The double burden of malnutrition is typically the presence of both undernutrition and obesity within a population.

Popkin, Barry M. \\"The nutrition transition and obesity in the developing world.\\" The Journal of nutrition 131.3 (2001): 871S-873S. =Dual burden of disease= Deemed as a developmental challenge of epidemic proportions, the double burden of disease (DBD) is an emerging global health challenge, that exists predominantly in low-to-middle income countries. More specifically, the DBD refers to the dual burden of communicable and non- communicable diseases (NCD). Today, over 90 per cent of the world's disease burden occurs in developing regions, and most are attributed to communicable diseases. Communicable diseases are infectious diseases that \\"can be passed between people through proximity, social contact or intimate contact.\\" Common diseases in this category include whooping cough or tuberculosis, HIV/AIDs, malaria, influenza (the flu), and mumps. As low-to-middle income countries continue to develop, the types of diseases that affecting populations within these countries shifts primarily from infectious diseases, such as diarrhea and pneumonia, to primarily non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and obesity. This shift is increasingly being referred to as the risk transition. Thus, as globalization and the proliferation of pre- packaged foods continues, traditional diets and lifestyles are changing in many developing countries. As such, it is becoming increasingly common to see low-to-middle income countries battle with century old issues such as food insecurity and undernutrition, in addition to emerging health epidemics such as chronic heart disease, hypertension, stroke, and diabetes. Diseases once characteristic of industrialized nations, are increasingly becoming health challenges of epidemic proportions in many low-to-middle income countries. =Economic impact= The economic impact of these rising rates and dual burdens of disease looks to be tremendous. Disability, decreased quality of life, greater use of health care facilities, and increased absenteeism are strong associated with obesity. With inadequate resources, poorly construed health systems, and a general lack of expertise to address the burden of infective diseases, the disease burden for low-to-middle countries is exacerbated by the rising rate of non-communicable diseases. This is often attributed to the fact that these countries by nature have ill-health systems that possess inadequate resources to detect and prevent many non-communicable diseases.‚Äù Social constructs within these countries often amplify the risk of the double burden, as inequality, gender, and other social determinants often have a role to play in disparate access and allocation of health services and resources. If current trends are maintained, the World Health Organization predicts that low-and-middle income countries will be unable to support the burden of disease within the foreseeable future. Implications for policy Countries worldwide have made several, varied efforts to address the consequences of the nutrition transition. These policies target the food environment, governance, food system, or education and can be generally classified into the following categories: = Public nutrition education policy = Nutrition education intends to facilitate healthy behavioral changes, at the individual level. Dietary guidelines, specifically, promote public awareness of nutritional needs. Over 60 countries in the Global North and South have established national dietary guidelines. = Nutrition labeling policy = Nutrition labeling for food packages and in restaurants may encourage consumers to choose healthier foods. Nutrition labeling has been emphasized as important in influencing food choices and potentially reducing the intake of fat, sugar, and sodium. = School-focused policy = Schools are viewed as a primary target of intervention for implementing nutrition- related policies. Children and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to exposure to unhealthy foods before, during, and after school. Children are more susceptible to developing early obesity and are likely to remain obese throughout adulthood. School policies are varied and specific to the political, economic, and social climates of a place. They can focus on increasing nutritional standards, promoting active lifestyles, regulating school meal programs, and banning the sale of certain foods and beverages in and around schools. = Food marketing regulation = Food marketing, via several media outlets ‚Äì television, the Internet, packaging, popular culture ‚Äì has been an effective strategy for influencing and changing consumers' food choices, particularly among children. Several studies have indicated the association between exposure to food advertising and food choices and beliefs. The impact of advertising has led to support for government level regulation of food marketing. Countries have implemented voluntary or mandatory restrictions on advertisements of unhealthy food products. Food companies are also urged to implement responsible food marketing strategies. Efforts by corporations should reverse drivers of food consumption, including convenience, low cost, good taste, and nutritional knowledge. Recommendations include downsizing packaging, reducing serving sizes, and recreating formulas to decrease caloric content. = Taxation = Stemming from the success of taxation of tobacco products in reducing tobacco usage, policy makers and researchers have adopted a parallel approach for reducing obesity. The WHO supported economic policies as a method of influencing food prices and promoting healthy eating in public spaces (cite, 2008). Tax policies, in the form of sin taxes or Pigovian taxes, generally target unhealthy food and drink products, including the \\"fat tax\\", \\"junk food tax\\", and of particular popularity, the tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). Taxation is intended to combat obesity by increasing the price of SSBs and unhealthy foods and in turn, reducing their consumption, as well as generating revenue that may be used towards obesity prevention programs or promotion of fruit and vegetable consumption. However, the effectiveness of taxation remains under scrutiny ‚Äì economists argue that taxes are inefficient for combating obesity and can result in greater losses for consumers. = Comprehensive approach = The literature suggests that it may be ideal for governments to adopt a holistic policy approach to address the obesity epidemic, given the associated social conditions. \\"Policy package\\" recommendations have been a supported framework for preventing obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases worldwide because they are adaptable to country-specific circumstances. For instance, the NOURISHING framework summarizes key avenues for action and policy but is flexible to suit a range of national and local contexts. The World Health Organization has called for governments to have multi-faceted interventions, focusing on food security, food safety, healthy lifestyle, and nutrition. Given the scope of the pandemic but the diverse place-based trends and risk factors, appropriate and adequate intervention calls for policy change across multiple levels ‚Äì population and individual ‚Äì and the need for international collaboration. At the same time, evaluations of programs and initiatives on their impact on obesity are necessary to both enhance efficacy of existing interventions and provide a foundation for future interventions. Case studies Case studies for individual nations are plentiful. The BRICS countries are specifically studied in great depth because of their rapidly transitioning economies, but more slowly developing nations are well studied too. =Industrialized nations= Case studies in the United States and United Kingdom are particularly bountiful. =Developing countries= Reports based in Latin America, Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, and developed areas of sub-Saharan Africa can be found in a wide range of academic literature. =Aboriginal populations= Worldwide, Aboriginal populations have experienced radical changes in diet. Traditional diets and food intakes have been replaced by diets consisting of foods high in fat, sugar and salt. This change in diet is related to the life-style changes during the last century: for example, Hunter-gatherer communities became more settled, and traditional food gathering methods changed. The nutrition transition has been linked to increased rates of non-communicable diseases amongst Aboriginal populations. Industrialization introduced a less complicated way to access food; a protein rich diet was replaced by white bread, processed food and sugary beverages. Traditional food of First Nations included burbot filet (or muscle) and moose liver. Food consumption provided essential fats (i.e., fatty acids) and proteins that played a key medicinal role in the prevention and reduction of obesity and obesity-related diseases.

This article lists individuals who were potential Democratic Party candidates for Vice President of the United States in the 2008 presidential election. After Illinois Senator Barack Obama became the Democratic Party's presumptive presidential nominee on June 3, 2008, Obama formed a small committee, made up of James A. Johnson (who stepped down after one week), Eric Holder and Caroline Kennedy, to help him select a running mate.See \\"Obama VP Vetter Tied to Controversial Mortgage Crisis\\", http://blogs.usatoday.com/onpolitics/2008/06/obama-vp- vetter.html?loc=interstitialskip, USA Today, 9 June 2008 Veteran Democratic lawyer and advisor James \\"Jim\\" Hamilton, of the firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, later replaced Johnson in vetting candidates.Freed, Benjamin. \\"Meet the DC Lawyer Helping Hillary Clinton Pick a Running Mate\\", Washingtonian, June 20, 2016.

Obama strongly considered Senator Evan Bayh and governors Tim Kaine and Kathleen Sebelius, but Obama ultimately decided to select Delaware Senator Joe Biden as his running mate. The Obama-Biden ticket won the 2008 presidential election, defeating the Republican McCain-Palin ticket.

Tim Kaine (cropped).jpgFile:Kathleen Sebelius official portrait (cropped).jpgFile:Bill Richardson.jpgFile:Jack Reed official photo.jpgFinal Days and Announcement In the final days leading up to the Democratic National Convention, four individuals were left on Obama's final list for Vice President: Joe Biden, Evan Bayh, Tim Kaine, and Kathleen Sebelius. On August 22, the eve of Obama's scheduled unveiling of his running mate, NBC News reported that Bayh and Kaine had been informed that they were not chosen. Last minute controversy emerged as it was learned that Senator Hillary Clinton was never vetted for the position, when it was earlier thought that Sen. Barack Obama would consider her as he previously stated in various private and public reports. This led to several questions as to whether Clinton supporters would feel betrayed and would defuse the intensity in \\"dream ticket\\" scenarios. That night, ABC News reported that the U.S. Secret Service had assumed protection of Biden, which was seen as a sign that he had been chosen as Obama's running mate. Just hours later, the Associated Press broke the news that Democratic Party officials had confided that Obama had in fact selected Biden as the vice-presidential nominee. Obama's campaign manager David Plouffe later wrote in his book The Audacity to Win, which was published in November 2009, that Bayh had been a \\"coin toss\\" away from becoming Obama's running mate. Plouffe and David Axelrod had interviewed the finalists and Plouffe said that Bayh's answers were \\"substantively close to perfect, if cautiously so.\\" He recalled that at the time of the interview he thought to himself, \\"there's no way this guy will color outside the lines... Bayh's up side and down side are probably the closest spread of the three\\", compared to Biden, who could \\"reach higher heights but could cause us real pain.\\" As Obama approached a decision, he told Plouffe \\"it's a coin toss now between Bayh and Biden, but Kaine is still a distinct possibility.\\" On August 17, Obama told Axelrod simply, \\"I've decided. It's Biden.\\" It was later reported that Obama told Kaine, in breaking the news to him, \\"You are the pick of my heart, but Joe [Biden] is the pick of my head\\".https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/us/politics/biden-obama-history.html On August 23, 2008, via text message, the Obama campaign announced that the then-presumptive Democratic presidential nominee chose Joe Biden as his vice- presidential running mate.

This chiral molecule is typically used, in nonracemic form, as a chiral shift reagent in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, in order to simultaneously determine absolute configuration and enantiomeric purity of other chiral molecules. The molecule is named after William H. Pirkle, Professor of Chemistry at the University of Illinois whose group reported its synthesis and its application as a chiral shift reagent. Synthesis Pirkle's alcohol is synthesized by trifluoroacetylation of anthracene, to yield trifluoromethyl 9-anthryl ketone. Trifluoromethyl 9-anthryl ketone may be reduced with a chiral hydride reagent prepared from lithium aluminium hydride and (4S,5S)-(‚Äì)-2-ethyl-4-hydroxymethyl-5-phenyl-2-oxazoline to generate Pirkle's alcohol with R absolute configuration. Alternatively, trifluoromethyl 9-anthryl ketone may be reduced with sodium borohydride to generate racemic Pirkle's alcohol. The enantiomers are then derivatized to diastereomeric carbamates using enantioenriched 1-(1-Naphthyl)ethyl isocyanate (also developed by Pirkle). These diastereomers may be separated by column chromatography and hydrolyzed to obtain each enantiomer of Pirkle's alcohol in enantiopure form. Application The determination of enantiomeric purity and absolute configuration is frequently necessary in organic synthesis. Pirkle's alcohol is applied to obtain this information by NMR spectroscopy. When Pirkle's alcohol is in solution with an ensemble of chiral molecules, short- lived diastereomeric solvates may be formed from Pirkle's alcohol and the enantiomers of the analyte. Enantiomorphic protons of the analyte enantiomers, which without Pirkle's alcohol are indistinguishable by NMR, become diastereomorphic when the analyte interacts with Pirkle's alcohol, and appear as different signals in an NMR spectrum. The relative magnitude of the signals quantitatively reveals the enantiomeric purity of the analyte. Also, a model of the solvated complex may be used to deduce absolute configuration of an enantioenriched analyte.

The route begins in the northwestern portion of the Connecticut state capital of Hartford and ends in the rural town of Granville. In Massachusetts, the route is not a state highway and is maintained by the town of Granville. Route description Route 189 begins at an intersection with US 44 in western Hartford and heads northwest, crossing into West Hartford. It passes the University of Hartford and the eastern end of Route 185, continuing northwest across the northeastern corner of West Hartford and crossing into Bloomfield. In Bloomfield, it continues north, crossing Route 218, and passes through the center of town where it intersects Route 178. North of town, it turns slightly northeast, and meets Route 187 to form a short freeway. After Route 187 leaves to the north, the freeway continues briefly, then downgrades to a 2 lane primary arterial road as it crosses into Simsbury. In Simsbury, it enters the Tariffville section of town, where it meets the eastern end of Route 315 before crossing the Farmington River into East Granby. In East Granby, it continues northwest to Granby. In Granby, it continues northwest, briefly overlapping US 202 and Route 10, immediately followed by a brief overlap with Route 20. It then continues northwest across the northwest portion of town, and crosses the Massachusetts state line into the town of Granville, ending at an intersection with Route 57 in the town center. History The route from Granby center northwest through North Granby to the Massachusetts state line was designated in 1922 as State Highway 206. In the 1932 state highway renumbering, Route 189 was established as a new designation for old Highway 206. It originally ran from Route 20 in Granby to the state line. At the same time, Massachusetts designated the continuation as Route 189 in Granville to Route 57. The portion south of Route 20 was, at the time, designated as part of Route 9. Before 1932, this portion was still part of New England Route 10. The original Route 9 in Bloomfield followed Tunxis Avenue into Tariffville before continuing north along Hartford Avenue, crossing the Farmington River three times in the process. In 1960, five years after two of the bridges were washed out in a flood, Route 9 was relocated to stay on the south side of the river along a newly built expressway. In 1963, with the opening of the Route 9 freeway south of Hartford, the section of Route 9 from US 44 in Hartford to Route 20 in Granby was reassigned as a southern extension of Route 189.

Architecture Pearson's plans called for a red brick structure, vaulted ceilings, and extensive interior stone sculpture in a style reminiscent of 13th-century Gothic architecture. The church was consecrated in 1880, but the tower and spire, remarkable for such structures in the Victorian era, were not constructed until 1897‚Äì1898.Humphrey, Stephen and James Morris, Churches and Cathedrals of London, New Holland Publishers (London), 2006. Sir Giles Gilbert Scott designed the reredos (altar screens) for the high altar in 1930. He also designed the reredos of the Lady Chapel and the Stations of the Cross. In 1878, two years prior to the dedication of the church, contemporary historian Edward Walford had already referred to St Augustine's, Kilburn, as \\"one of the finest examples of ecclesiastical structures in London\\".Edward Walford, Old and New London: Volume 5, British History website, accessed 2 March 2008, http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45234 The spire measures more than high. Completed in 1878, the nave measures nine metres (28 feet) wide with nine bays and a crossing that is bounded by transepts on the north and south sides. The religious art in various forms depicts most of the major biblical stories. Clayton and Bell created the stained glass windows, which include a large rose window depicting the Creation, nine clerestory windows (five depicting types of angels), nave windows depicting saints connected with England, a window depicting Saint Augustine and several other tall lancet windows. Paintings around the nave depict the healing ministry of Christ. The chancel and sanctuary are surrounded by densely-carved sculptural forms representing the Passion, Crucifixion, Entombment, and Resurrection of Christ, as well as the Apostles, saints and other religious iconography. The south transept leads to St Michael's Chapel with depictions of the Eucharist, sacrifice, angels and the worship of Heaven. The Lady Chapel presents frescoes of the Christ child and a later carving of Christ's Presentation in the Temple.Saint Augustine, Kilburn website, accessed 2 March. 2008, http://www.saint-augustine.org.uk/section/14 .

He also took part in two Olympic Games, in 1924 and 1928. He was a club player of HFC in Haarlem, the oldest club in The Netherlands.

He showed no remorse and stated that he did not know that the Netherlands was at war with Germany when he joined the SS. Van der Meulen was sentenced to eight years in prison. He was pardoned in August 1949 and opened a new medical clinic, but met a chilly treatment both in the medical and football worlds. His only clients were the former Nazi associates, and nobody wanted to talk to him when he went to see his son play at his former football club.

Biography Willis attended Bingham Military School in Asheville, North Carolina, and later moved to Knoxville, Tennessee where he became involved with a patent medicine firm. Willis began to sell and promote the medicines. In 1913 he founded International Proprietaries, Inc., and made a fortune selling a tonic called Tanlac. Although chemists at the time branded it quackery, as it was simply fortified wine with herbs and a laxative, the tonic sold very well nevertheless. Willis sold his firm in 1922 but then made another fortune with Zonite, an antiseptic preparation based on Dakin's solution, widely used in World War I. In 1922, as head of its finance committee, Willis led a $2 million fundraising drive for Georgia Tech. Willis was also active in real estate development in the Atlanta area. Willis commissioned the 1917 Druid Apartments at the corner of Ponce de Leon Avenue and Highland Avenue in Atlanta's Poncey-Highland neighborhood, now the site of the Briarcliff Plaza, Atlanta's first shopping center.Advertisement in Atlanta Constitution, June 24, 1917, p.14A In 1924, he purchased the town of Ingleside, Georgia, just east of Decatur and there built the new planned community of Avondale Estates, Georgia. The distinctive Tudor Revival architecture of the town was inspired by a recent trip that he and his wife had taken to Stratford-upon-Avon, England. Willis sought input from internationally known city planners; Avondale Estates was the first documented planned city in the Southeastern United States. In 1928 Willis introduced a new medicine, Sargon, and became president of the Stone Mountain Confederate Monumental Association.

It makes its home on rocky shores near the low tide mark. It preys on mollusks. It can grow as large as in diameter. Its color varies from brown to red or purple. Reproduction and regeneration Giant sea stars have small eggs, and their sperm contain spherical heads. Once their larvae are born, they are bilaterally symmetrical. By the time they mature and reach adulthood they are centered on a set point with radial symmetry to their bodies. The gonads of the giant sea star grow in a winters time just in time for spawning season between the months of March and April. Habitat Giant sea stars are usually found around the protected coastlines with low tide. They can often be found attached to rocks, pier supports or in the sand. Description Giant sea stars have a dense body with wide arms. Its surface is either tan or brown, but on occasion the giant sea star can have a yellowish or grayish surface. They contain thick, blunt spines that are bluish in color with white, pink or purple tips that are swollen and surrounded by brown fuzz and pedicellariae that have a plier like shape. These pedicellariae are used as a protective mechanism against predators. They have no distinct pattern. They range from from the tip of one arm to the other. They are usually found up to down in the water. Predators and prey The giant sea star only has a few predators. Sea otters and sea birds feed on giant sea stars, and their larvae are eaten by certain types of sea snails. They prey on several kinds of sea organisms including barnacles, gastropods, bivalves and limpets. It eats its prey by extending its stomach so it can fit into tiny gaps, such as mussel shells.

Ruth) (March 6, 1914 - September 13, 2002), who got his start in vaudeville in 1927, was a gospel singer, deejay and concert promoter, and a forefather of such rhythm and blues (R&B;) producers as Ralph Bass. Ruth had organized the Selah Jubilee Singers, a gospel group drawn from the membership of a church choir, leaving it in 1949 to pursue more secular interests in music. Ruth was a deejay on WOV, a radio station in New York City, at a time in the late 1940s when gospel groups such as Sister Rosetta Tharpe, the Pilgrim Travelers and the Five Blind Boys were touring the country playing in shabby settings with few amenities for the performers. Meanwhile, rhythm and blues groups were becoming so popular that theaters such as the Apollo Theater began featuring highly successful R&B; revues. Gospel groups were popular on radio stations but their performances made no money. No one had yet conceived of combining the power of gospel with the highly charged, money-making revue format of the successful R&B; acts that appealed to urban audiences. In 1955, Ruth succeeded in signing a gospel group to play in a commercial theater for the first time in the history of American entertainment. Subsequently Ruth continued to feature gospel groups as a prominent and influential deejay and promoter. Early life and career Thermon Ruth was born in Newberry County, South Carolina, and moved as a child with his family to Brooklyn, New York in 1922. By about 1927, while working as deejay at WOV in Brooklyn, he founded The Selah Jubilee Singers. The group later based in Raleigh, North Carolina, where they had a daily program of music on radio station WPTF. In 1949, Ruth formed a secular vocal group with fellow singers Allen Bunn, David McNeil, Hadie Rowe Jr., and Raymond \\"Pee Wee\\" Barnes. Based in New York, they became best known as The Larks, although the group also recorded under many other names including The Jubilators, The 4 Barons and The Southern Harmonaires. The group had some success on the Billboard R&B; charts, their biggest hit being \\"Eyesight to the Blind\\" in 1951 on which Bunn (later known as Tarheel Slim) sang lead vocals. The original Larks split up in 1952. Professionalizing gospel By 1950, Ruth was very aware that gospel groups had become popular acts although they usually appeared in dusty store fronts, not in thriving, jiving black theaters.B. Dexter Allgood, The Black Perspective in Music: Vol. 18, No. 1/2 (1990), pp. 101-115 The lifestyle of the gospel singers prevented them from appearing in such venues as the Apollo Theater, while the secular R&B; groups were appearing there and in other urban rhythm and blues theaters, performing pulsating hit gospel songs. Ruth had the idea of convincing Frank Schiffman, then owner of the Apollo (who was dubious that a gospel act would succeed in his theater) of giving the Selah Jubilee Singers a trial performance on the Apollo stage. A more difficult task for Ruth was to convince the Selah Jubilee Singers that playing at the Apollo was not sinful. At that time, gospel music was considered sacred music and not to be performed as secular entertainment. Ruth convinced the group by arguing that, since the Apollo was a sinful den of iniquity, that was exactly where a gospel group should sing. There they could bring the sacred message to the sinners, and that the building itself should not matter if their performance of gospel was to worship God . Further, not only would they have a real stage with professional stage lighting and great musical acoustics, for the first time they would be guaranteed to be paid a remuneration whether the show was a success nor not. On December 15, 1955, the Selah Jubilee Singers debuted at the Apollo, the first gospel group to play there or at any commercial theater. Thurman ensured that a variety of gospel was featured in order to broaden the appeal: gospel, jubilee, and spirituals but with an emphasis on rhythm as well as the emotional components of gospel. The shows were stimulating, exciting and a great success with the Apollo regulars. Dionne Warwick remembers that the audience became overwhelmed with emotion. \\"We were entertainers,\\" remembers Ruth. Gospels acts became commercial hits. The Selah Jubilee Singers became a professional R&B; group, the Larks, in the 1950s. Ruth also taught the gospel groups to abide by theatrical rules, such as keeping firm to time limits on stage, as they were used to singing as long as the spirit hit them in the storefronts. Having to pay stage hands overtime was a major motivation in convincing the gospel groups to confine their performances to the time allotted to them. They also learned to keep theatrical schedules, performing their act whether the spirit hit them or not. Popular gospel Ruth organized the first of many Gospel Caravans, a professional package tour of gospel acts modeled after the popular R&B; revues that traveled the country's entertainment circuit. This was the beginning of the popularity of the touring gospel groups have become part of the American music scene. Thurman Ruth was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame.

The names of Xu√°nz≈çng I (ÁéÑÂÆó) and XuƒÅnz≈çng II (ÂÆ£ÂÆó) are originally different in Mandarin Chinese, but are rendered the same in Pinyin English transliteration (once the tones have been removed). The Tang emperors claimed descent from people such as Li Guang and Laozi  Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period The fifty years between the fall of the Tang dynasty and the establishment of the Song dynasty were a time of upheaval known as the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. During this period, five short-lived imperial dynasties ruled the heart of China, while a series of small independent kingdoms were established in the south. =Later Liang= The Later Liang ruled between 907 and 923. =Later Tang= The Later Tang ruled between 923 and 937. =Later Jin= The Later Jin ruled between 936 and 947. =Later Han and Northern Han= The Later Han ruled between 947 and 951.

The Tuoba clan of the Xianbei of Tuyuhun founded the Western Xia. After the Tibetans destroyed the Tuyuhun in 670, its famous prince, Tuoba Chici, who controlled the Dangxiang Qiang submitted to the Tang, which \\"bestowed\\" upon him the royal name of Li (Êùé). Towards the end of the Tang, the Tuoba brought troops to suppress the Huang Chao Rebellion (874‚Äì884) on behalf of the Tang court and took control of the Xia State, or Xia Zhou, in northern Shaanxi in 881. After the Tang fell in 907, the Tuoba descendants formally declared resistance against the expanding Northern Song in 982 and proclaimed independence to establish the Western Xia in 1038. The foundation of Western Xia goes back to the year 982 under Li Jiqian. However, only in 1038 did the Tangut chieftain Li Yuanhao (son of Li Deming, named himself emperor of Da Xia and demanded the Song emperor recognise him as an equal. The Song court recognised Li Yuanhao as governor but not as \\"emperor\\", a title it regarded as exclusive to the Song emperor. After intense diplomatic contacts, in 1043 the Tangut state accepted the recognition of the Song emperor as emperor in exchange for annual gifts, which implied tacit recognition on the part of the Song of the military power of the Tanguts.

Such lands allow for aboriginal commercial ventures which enjoy the tax exemptions offered to traditional reserves. They may be located within either a municipality or, in the case of Saskatchewan, a Northern Administration District. An urban reserve may result from either encroachment of a municipal area into existing reserve lands, or from the designation of land in an existing urban territory. Some commercial urban reserves exist as satellites to rural reserves. It has been suggested that the generated revenue will help maintain the economic well-being of the associated rural community. History The first such reserve was established in 1981 at Kylemore, Saskatchewan as operated by the Fishing Lake First Nation (Treaty 4). Another urban reserve under the Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation (Treaty 6) followed at Prince Albert in 1982. It is argued that the first formal commercial urban reserve was a property of established within Saskatoon in 1988 for the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation. By 2004, the reserve's commercial activity grew to provide employment for 350 people under 37 businesses, today known as the McKnight Commercial Centre. The Treaty Land Entitlement Framework Agreement (TLEFA) was signed on 9 September 1992 to settle unresolved treaty land claims for 28 First Nation groups in Saskatchewan. Article 9 of this accord provides a mechanism for First Nations groups to contract with municipal governments to allow designation of certain properties as reserves. At least four urban reserves are also established in Manitoba. One of these, situated north of Winnipeg under the auspices of the Roseau River Anishinabe First Nation (Treaty 1), includes a gas station and a tobacco retailer with plans to include a medical facility and larger operations such as automobile retail. Opinions Critics such as the Canadian Taxpayers Federation are concerned that such reserves are entitled to exemptions from taxation that other businesses in a community do not enjoy. Furthermore, there are complications in disposing of urban reserve lands which require approval of the operating First Nation, and that reserve lands would revert to federal government control. Other critics such as the Frontier Centre for Public Policy concede that urban reserves have benefits, but wish the abolishment of the reserve system and other racially based policies as a whole. Proponents of urban reserves note that these encourage a diverse land base which provides business opportunities for First Nations people. It is also claimed that there are advantages to the surrounding community due to spin-off business activity which contributes favourably to those outside the reserve. Examples Examples include: * Capilano Indian Reserve No.5, inside Vancouver * Enoch Cree Nation 135, which borders Edmonton * Kitsilano Indian Reserve No.6, inside Vancouver * Mission Indian Reserve No.6, which borders North Vancouver * Tsuu T'ina Nation 145, Alberta, which borders Calgary * Membertou First Nation, inside Sydney, Nova Scotia (Cape Breton Regional Municipality) * Cole Harbour 30, inside Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia (Halifax Regional Municipality) * St. Mary's First Nation, inside Fredericton * Long Plain 6B, Manitoba, which borders Portage la Prairie * Long Plain 6C, Manitoba, inside Winnipeg * Wendake, an enclave surrounded by Quebec City See also *Urban MƒÅori *Urban Indian External links * CBC article 'Demystifying urban reserves' https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/demystifying-urban-reserves-1.2993051 * Opinion item which advocates urban reserves for Ottawa, Ontario.

In 1932, old Highway 208 was renumbered to Route 191, running from Route 140 in Melrose to the current northern terminus in Scitico. In 1941, it was extended west along the current route of Route 140 to US 5 in Warehouse Point. In 1962, as part of a series of realignments triggered by the opening of the Bradley Airport Connector, the western section of Route 140 and the southern section of Route 191 were exchanged.

Conceptual origins In 1840, Pierre Joseph Proudhon, a French anarchist, wrote What Is Property?, a question to which he famously answered \\"property is theft\\". By this, Proudhon meant that legitimate private property could result only from an individual's labor and all other capital was, in effect, stolen.Parry, Richard. The Bonnot Gang. Rebel Press, 1987. p. 15 This economic world view converged in the minds of radicals with the Russian theorist Mikhail Bakunin's concept of propaganda of the deed, the use of physical violence against political enemies as a method of inspiring the masses. A marginal sector of European individualist anarchism derived the idea of individual reclamation as a means of breaking down what they perceived as the robbery of the laboring class by capitalists, politicians and the church. The individual's expropriation was regarded as legitimate resistance against an unfair social order, an ethical right to even the distribution of wealth. Practice Well-known 19th century practitioners of individual reclamation included Ravachol and Cl√©ment Duval. A later generation of European anarchists, influenced by the anti-essentialism of Max Stirner, would eventually abandon the ethical framing of individual reclamation, proposing an ideology of illegalism and openly embracing criminality as a lifestyle. The most famous of these practitioners included the infamous Bonnot Gang of France. In the 20th century, Lucio Urtubia, a Spanish practitioner of individual reclamation, stole millions from Citibank by forging traveler's checks. Between 1993 and 2007, Jaime Gim√©nez Arbe robbed 36 banks in Spain, stealing more than ‚Ç¨700,000 in what he described as an effort \\"to liberate the Spanish people\\" from the banking sector.'Loner' claims he robbed banks 'to liberate Spanish people' See also * Agorism * Expropriative anarchism * Labor theory of value * Robin Hood * Yomango Notes References * Proudhon, Pierre Joseph.

Biography His grand nephew Cathiravelu Sittampalam was the first Cabinet Minister of Posts and Telecommunications in the independent Sri Lanka. Viswanather Casipillai was born to a distinguished Tamil Family whose ancestry can be traced to the ancient Royal Kuriyans, highly respected noblemen of the king‚Äôs Court of the Tamil Kingdom of Nallur. Two descendants of these noblemen, Vanniyasingam Kuriyan and Canagasekara Kothanda Kuriyan, lived in Jaffna later during the Dutch regime. In the 19th century, Visvanathar son of Vinayakar, who descended from Canagasekara Kothanda Kuriyan, abandoned the prestigious Kuriyan title as no longer relevant under the British and became famous as an entrepreneur for leasing large extends of crown land at Ariyalai for salt production on large scale. Subsequently, many of his descendants were to distinguished themselves in public life of North Province. Visvanathar had two sons Arumugam and Casipillai. The former died young and his children were brought up by the latter, his younger brother. Arumugam's eldest son Cathiravelu was C. Sittmapalam's father. He functioned as a magistrate and district judge and was the first editor of Tamil Journal \\"Inthu sathanam\\" and founder of the Saraswathy library. Visvanthar's second son Casipillai while being C.Sittampalam‚Äôs grand-uncle was, also, his wife's grandfather. He was one of the most illustrious citizens of the North. Leonard Woolf, the famous British Civil Servant, author of the classic 'Village in the jungle' and husband of Virginia, a member of the Bloomsbury set ( which included Keynes, the famous economist) published in his autobiography a letter from Casipillai as a testimonial of his own (Woolfs) standing among Tamils Casipillai worked closely with Sri Arumuga Navalar in promoting Hinduism, and functioned as secretary of the Saiva Paripalanai Sabey and was a co-founder and subsequent manager of Jaffna Hindu College. One of the houses there is Casipillai House in his honour. He was a great philanthropist, and was often referred to as Mudisoodamannan. He was widely sought after for his brains and original contribution to problems and called the Brains trust. Other terms were Jaffna and Mannar's Thanai Perusa Thalaivan and illangai Perumahan. The establishment of Sitthivinayagar Kovil and Parvathy Vithyasalai were among two of his achievements. Another single contribution was his participation in the agitation for a railway to Jaffna crowned with success in 1906. His son Casipillai Arulampalam and grandson Arulampalam Visvananthan continued to follow their fathers to become one of the prestigious lawyers in Jaffna.

Robertson). Hoadley despises the children and has only taken them in as good publicity for the upcoming election. His wife, Mrs. Hoadley (Julia Swayne Gordon) is equally cruel to the children, especially Polly. One day, Polly Biggs takes the children fishing and meets a young man named John Oxmore (Antonio Moreno), who is the son of the opposing mayoral candidate. When she returns home, Polly discovers that her uncle intends to send all the children to the poorhouse as soon as the election is over. Polly plans to take revenge on her uncle and immediately takes the children to the poorhouse herself, rather than let her uncle do so. Mayor Hoadley, frightened that voters may be incensed to learn that his nieces and nephews are living as orphans in a squalid poorhouse, goes to retrieve them. When Polly sees his car arriving at the poorhouse, she and the children flee. They find an unoccupied cabin in the woods where the brood of youngsters settle in. Unbeknownst to Polly, the cabin is owned by John Oxmore, the young man she met earlier. After Oxmore finds them at his cabin, he grants Polly permission to keep the children there. However, the next day he is accused of a murder committed by Mayor Hoadley. Although John was at the cabin at the time the murder was committed but he says nothing, in hopes of sparing Polly and the children. After John is arrested and Polly discovers his fate, she rushes to the courthouse and announces that John couldn't have committed the crime because he was with her and the children when it occurred. John is released and the cruel Mayor Hoadley is arrested and convicted of the crime.

Located on the shores of Shinobazu Pond within Ueno Park, it is dedicated to the traditional culture of Tokyo's Shitamachi. The museum opened in 1980, six years before the Fukagawa Edo Museum and thirteen years before the Edo-Tokyo Museum, all part of a national trend for building local history museums. All three were primarily designed by Total Media.Sand, Jordan, Tokyo Vernacular: Common Spaces, Local Histories, Found Objects, University of California Press, 2013, , p. 120 Historical background Shitamachi, literally 'Low City', is the unofficial name for the Tokyo flatlands, the area of Tokyo going from Tait≈ç to Chiyoda and Chu≈ç. It is the physically low part of the city just east of the Sumida River.Edward Seidensticker: Low City, High City: Tokyo from Edo to the Earthquake: how the shogun's ancient capital became a great modern city, 1867-1923 It was inhabited by Edo's lower classes, including craftsmen, fishermen, sailors and merchants. The area produced most of what was original in Edo's culture and was the entertainment and shopping center of the capital. What remains of the old Shitamachi can nowadays be found in and around Tokyo's Taito, for example in Asakusa. The Shitamachi Museum is dedicated to explaining this area and its distinctive culture through original artifacts.

In front of the shop are parked a rickshaw and a hand-pulled cart from old Edo. To the left stands the replica of a small tenement house shared by two families, each owning a shop. On one side there live a mother and her daughter, who sell cheap sweets in the small shop adjacent their living quarters. On the other, there lives a coppersmith who works and sells his wares here. The well and the washing board next to the house are original items used in Edo times in the Shitamachi. All objects exhibited were donated by the public and were in use during the Taish≈ç period (1912‚Äì1926). =Second floor= The second floor consists of a more varied collection of exhibits.

R.\\" Bowker (September 4, 1848 ‚Äì November 12, 1933) was a journalist, editor of Publishers Weekly and Harper's Magazine, and founder of the R. R. Bowker Company. thumb|right|alt=R. R. Bowker, Melvil Dewey, and Mrs. Dewey in Saratoga Springs, New York Bowker, Mrs. Dewey, and Melvil Dewey (courtesy of the American Library Association Archives) Early life and education Richard Rogers Bowker was born in Salem, Massachusetts, on September 4, 1848, to a successful, educated family. ; Family His paternal grandfather, Joel Bowker (1775‚Äì1858) rose from a grocery clerk to a leading merchant and part owner of sailing vessels. Bowker Place in Salem is named after Joel Bowker. His mother, Theresa Maria Bowker (n√©e Savory; 1825‚Äì1906), was the daughter of Richard Savory (1781‚Äì1841), who owned a large cooperage in Salem. His father, Daniel Rogers Bowker (1820‚Äì1895), was a partner in a prestigious business enterprise involving the sale of coal and salt in Salem until the financial panic in 1857, coupled with the death of the leading partner in the business, caused the business to fail. The family moved to New York City where Bowker's father started a barrel-making business. The business never prospered, so the family never regained the affluence it had enjoyed. The plan for Bowker to attend Harvard had to be scrapped. Instead, he attended the Free School in 1863 and entered the City College of New York in 1866. Bowker thrived at City College. He founded, edited, managed and published The Collegian, one of the first college newspapers in the country. He was an organizer and member of the student senate. Bowker was instrumental in establishing a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa at the college, but, ironically, was blackballed from membership by the school's president for his \\"radical\\" activities in student government and the student newspaper. Years later the injustice was corrected. In 1868 he graduated with a B.A. in journalism. Bowker married Alice G. Mitchell (1864‚Äì1941) in Brookline, Massachusetts on January 1, 1902. Alice's mother, Zilpha Maria Mitchell (n√©e Morton; 1834‚Äì1888) was a first cousin of Levi Parsons Morton (1824‚Äì1920), 22nd Vice President of the United States (1889‚Äì1893) and 31st Governor of New York (1895‚Äì1897). Career After graduation Bowker began his successful career in journalism at the newly established New York Evening Mail where he was city editor and literary editor from 1868 to 1874. From 1875 to 1878 he wrote a column for the New York Tribune and became manager of The New York Times in 1896. Between 1880 and 1882 he lived in London and managed the British edition of Harper's Magazine. In addition to journalism, he also became involved in publishing and book sales. He assisted in organizing the first American Book Trade Show and was hired by prestigious London and New York publishers as their representatives at various times. In 1872 Bowker and his friend and mentor, Frederick Leypoldt, began publishing the Publishers Weekly (then The Publishers' Weekly), which became the most important book-trade journal in America. Bowker served as an owner and editor of the publication for fifty years. Interests and activities Bowker became interested in politics at City College. In 1880 he founded the Society for Political Education to inform the public on social and political issues. He was a liberal Republican who played a leading role in enacting of civil service and municipal reforms in New York in the 1880s and in 1880 wrote the civil service reform plank that was adopted in the national Republican platform. In 1879 he was a leading member of the independent Republican Movement, also known as the \\"Mugwump\\" movement in national politics. In 1880 the Mugwumps helped defeat the nomination of Ulysses Grant for a third term because of the scandals during his administrations. Service to libraries and librarians In May 1876 Bowker, Leypoldt, and Melvil Dewey met in New York City to discuss the development of libraries. At the time the country had 3,647 libraries with 300 or more books. The number of books in these libraries totaled 12,276,964. The libraries operated on a subscription basis with no access to shelves and no children's sections. No uniform system for classifying books existed. Libraries were shifting from bound-volume catalogues to hand-written catalogue cards of varied sizes. At the meeting the three men agreed to establish a library profession, to publish a library journal and to organize a national library association. In September 1876 Leypoldt and Bowker published volume one of the Library Journal. Melvil Dewey was the managing editor of the journal. They organized the American Library Association in October, 1876. The organization would be used as a model for many European countries. After a few years Dewey left the publication for financial and personal reasons. Bowker remained the heart and soul of the publication for many years despite its lack of financial success. He not only wrote regular editorials, but also numerous essays on the library system for the publication. In March 1884 Leypoldt died. Despite the fact that Leypoldt's bibliography project had been a time- consuming, financial loss, Bowker, a chairman of the Committee on Public Documents of the American Library Association, took on the responsibility for the American Catalogue, an index of all books published in the United States. Furthermore, he added three new features, United States government documents, publications of American literary, scientific and other societies and state government publications. During the next fifteen years he published a revised edition of the catalogue every five years. Bowker worked tirelessly for the benefit of libraries throughout his adult life. More than once he was asked to be president of the American Library Association, but declined because he thought it would be inappropriate since he was not a librarian. He regularly attended A.L.A. conventions and was selected as an honorary member of the organization for all his many contributions to libraries and the library profession. His efforts in behalf of individual libraries were many. In 1885 Bowker helped organize and was the first president of the New York Library Club. He served as a trustee for the Brooklyn Public Library from its incorporation in 1902 until his death and gave most of his personal library to it. For twenty-four years he served as president of the Stockbridge Library Association in Massachusetts. He generously donated ten thousand dollars to the Library of Congress for bibliographical services. It was written of Bowker that \\"Few in the library world had wider acquaintance, few had more lasting friendships, few were more generous in recognition of new talent, few more cherishing of old memories.\\" All of this and more earned Bowker a spot as one of the ‚Äú100‚Ä¶most important leaders we had in the 20th century.‚Äù  Selected works  * The arts of life :: Author: Bowker, R.

The train station currently serves as a seasonal stop (on Saturdays) for the Cape Cod Central Railroad. The station building, which is owned by the Town of Barnstable, Massachusetts, is the headquarters on the Cape Cod Chapter of the National Railway Historical Society (NRHS). The Cape Cod Chapter of the NRHS signed a twenty-year lease on the building in 2012. They have been restoring it as a historical railway station and museum since 2001 when they became the custodian of the building. The station building, which is open to the public on Saturdays between May and October, also hosts numerous special events, including National Train Day in May, the West Barnstable village festival in August and the Cranberry Express in October. History Postcard of original station, ca. 1905 The original passenger station in West Barnstable was opened in 1854 by the Cape Cod Railroad. This station was torn down and a new station was built, at the same location, by the New Haven Railroad in 1911 at a cost of $18,000. The original architecture style of the station was identical to the stations that the New Haven Railroad built in Buzzards Bay and Sagamore around the same time. The station served trains to Boston and seasonal trains to New York City and remained in service until 1964 when the New Haven Railroad ran its last passenger trains to Cape Cod including the Day Cape Codder. Between 1986 and 1996 it was an unmanned station stop for Amtrak's Cape Codder service. It is one station that has been eliminated from the schedule of the seasonal Cape Flyer train service between Boston and Hyannis. From the 19th Century, under the Old Colony Railroad and until 1964 under the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, passenger trains served Sandwich. Trains of the 1940s-1960s included the Day Cape Codder and the Neptune. The property once included a detached freight house but it was torn down a few decades ago. The station was used as a shooting location for the feature films The Golden Boys and The Lightkeepers.

The airport is publicly owned. Arcadia is 51 miles East of Bradenton and 64 miles West of Okeechobee on SR 70 and 28 miles NE of Port Charlotte on US 17. During WW1 Arcadia was known as ‚ÄúAviation City‚Äù because of all the military aviation training going on at Carlstrom & Dorr Fields. In 1934 the City of Arcadia bought 225 acres for delinquent taxes. A $10,000 federal grant was acquired to build a hangar and an airfield to be used as a ‚Äúsecondary field‚Äù to the Carlstrom Military Airfield located just south of Arcadia during the war. The original field had two turf runways approximately 2,500 feet in length. A flight school was established on the field about 1946. Then from the mid-1970s through the mid-1980s Pat Hange and Harriet Hamilton operated Lennox Flight School where they trained many aircraft and glider pilots. Both Pat & Harriet are in the Soaring Hall of Fame. In 2009 the City of Arcadia established an Airport Advisory Committee made up of 7 members. FDOT grant funding has been obtained and many improvement projects are on schedule for 2012 and beyond. In 2012 some members of the Airport Advisory Committee formed an airport support group called the Friends of Arcadia Airport, Inc. dedicated to help the airport grow and prosper. They began by hosting fly-in pancake breakfasts that attract out of town pilots to fly in and visit the airport and the downtown businesses thus assisting the local economy as well. These breakfasts have proven to be very successful and continue to promote the airport in a positive light. In 2014 Friends of Arcadia Airport, Inc. began work clearing some unused land on the airport to develop a Fly-In/Camp-Out Center. Recreational under wing camping is growing in popularity and Friends recognized the potential of this type of on airport facility to help make Arcadia Municipal a destination airport for pilots who enjoy airplane camping. They developed a unique facility where pilots can taxi right onto the campsite area and push their plane back under beautiful oaks and pitch their tent. The site features a 20 X 30 pilot shelter with picnic tables, a beautiful fire pit surrounded by brick pavers, running water and portable toilets. The site is already attracting pilots from all over the S.E. United States and has hosted pilot seminars and large fly-in camping events. Friends is working with local businesses and attractions to provide transportation into town for the visiting pilots. The site was fully funded by Friends and donated to the City of Arcadia who owns the airport. Site use must be aviation related and is by reservation only through Friends of Arcadia Airport, Inc.

At the height of his tenure with Pillsbury, he was responsible for the creation or oversaw the operations of such restaurants as Bennigan's, Burger King, and H√§agen-Dazs. When he left Pillsbury in 1984 to purchase a small gourmet burger shop called Chili's, Brinker saw his greatest business success. The company eventually became one of the largest restaurant holding companies in the world with five chains operating 1900 restaurants in 25 countries. Now known as Brinker International, the company currently employs over 100,000 people and has system-wide sales exceeding US$4 billion annually. During the 1950s, Brinker engaged in a hectic and busy lifestyle. He joined the U.S. Navy in 1952; during his stint in the service, Brinker used his passion and talent for horse riding to earn a place on the United States Olympic Equestrian team in the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland, and the 1954 modern pentathlon world championships in Budapest, Hungary. While stationed in San Diego, California, he chose to attend San Diego State College, now San Diego State University. During his time in college, he met and married Tennis Grand Slam winner and world champion Maureen \\"Little Mo\\" Connolly in 1955, became president of his class, and graduated with honors in 1957. His marriage, which produced two children, ended in 1969, when she succumbed to ovarian cancer. His 1971‚Äî1976 marriage to Margrit Fendt produced two more children. In 1981, Brinker met and later married his third wife, Nancy Goodman, on February 14, 1983. He was gravely injured in a polo accident in 1993, was chair of the United States Polo Association,William Clark Hetherington, Six Chukkers Of Love, AuthorHouse, 2005, p. 122 inducted into the Museum of Polo and Hall of Fame on March 6, 1998, and retired from Brinker International in 2001. They engaged in many Republican causes and fund-raising missions during their time together. The couple was amicably divorced in 2003. He married his fourth wife, Toni Chapman, in March 2003 and remained with her until his death in 2009. While Brinker created and donated to numerous charities and foundations over his lifetime, his 20-year marriage to Nancy produced one of the most famous charities of the 20th century. With the memory of his first wife's battle with the disease in the 1960s, the Brinkers used his wealth to establish a fund dedicated to advancing treatment for cancer in the name of Mrs. Brinker's sister who had died of breast cancer in 1980 at the age of 39. The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation was established in 1982 and eventually became known as Susan G. Komen for the Cure; it since has become one of the most prominent cancer-related charities in the world. Despite the divorce, Brinker remained with the foundation until the end.  Professional  left After Brinker had graduated from college, he took a job with a small chain of diners in San Diego named Oscar's. At the time, Oscar's owner Bob Peterson had also opened a second chain in the area called Jack in the Box; while Brinker succeeded in his position, he was eventually drawn to Peterson's growing fast-food business. At Jack-in-the-Box, Brinker flourished, helping the business expand across the Southwestern United States. Within two years of moving over to the company, he had been elevated to the position of president of the company and amassed a 20% stake in it. Brinker developed a close professional relationship with Peterson, taking many of his business philosophies to heart and developing the food-service philosophy that he attempted to follow throughout his career. Brinker said of Peterson, \\"Bob Peterson was really my mentor. Everything we do here today started back then. Letting ideas rise from below, treating people right‚Äîall of that.\\" When Jack in the Box went public in the early 1960s, Brinker sold his interest in the company and moved to Dallas with the intent to open a new business. His first endeavor was a coffee shop he named after himself, Brinks. The concept was to create a restaurant that catered to the 25- to 44-year-old demographic, a group that was still in the early stages of developing a taste for inexpensive fast food. The shop proved successful, and he sold it two years later. Using the proceeds from the sale, he opened a new chain in 1966 with the intent of providing an affordable steak dinner to the middle class. He called his new concept Steak and Ale. With the Steak and Ale chain, Brinker originated the concept of the modern casual dining restaurant that is now ubiquitous in the marketplace. One of the innovations that Brinker introduced with Steak and Ale was the salad bar . Besides the novel concept of having customers leave their tables to serve themselves from a salad buffet, the Dallas-based chain also created the now common stock introduction of \\"Hi, my name is ______, and I will be your waiter tonight.\\" These ideas were part of an overall plan to establish a restaurant that was more relaxed with a more casual atmosphere. Over the next ten years, he went on to establish a niche industry that was situated between the fast-food and higher-priced gourmet segments of the restaurant field. By 1976, he had taken the chain to 109 restaurants, and had successfully introduced the American consumer to the concept of the chain restaurant. He then sold his company to Pillsbury and assumed a position in the company's restaurant division. As a part of the acquisition, Brinker was given the position executive vice president of Pillsbury's restaurant operations, as well as a seat on the company's board of directors. During his tenure as executive VP, Brinker oversaw the creation of the company's Bennigan's chain. Bennigan's was the first in a new concept of restaurants intended to attract single people, a concept that became known as the \\"fern bar\\". As his status in Pillsbury grew, Brinker was asked to take over the operations of its main fast-food chain, Burger King. By the early 1980s, Burger King's sales had begun to fade. Brinker was asked to turn the brand around and strengthen its position against its main rival, McDonald's. One of his first acts was to initiate an advertising plan emphasizing claims that Burger King's flame-broiled burgers were better and larger than its rival's. The program, arguably the first attack ads on a food chain by a competitor, was controversial in that before it fast-food ads only made allusions to the competition in a vague manner, never mentioning them by name. McDonald's sued Burger King and their ad agency at the time, the J. Walter Thompson Company. Child actress Sarah Michelle Gellar was also implicated in the lawsuit because of her appearance in these television commercials. The suit was settled the following year on undisclosed terms. Despite the controversy, the ad plan boosted same-store sales when sales took off. The whole situation at the time became known as the Burger Wars. He worked for the company in this capacity until 1982, when he was promoted to president of Pillsbury's food-service division. His new role expanded his oversight to include the company's other chains, including Burger King, Quik-Wok, and Poppin' Fresh. However his new position was short lived, as he left the company in 1984 to take over a small, Dallas-based gourmet burger chain called Chili's. = Industry impact = Beyond launching several restaurant chains and the creation of one of the most widely emulated restaurant formats used in the market today, Brinker had another, indirect impact on the food-service industry. Over his nearly 50-year career, he worked with, hired or trained many executives who have gone on to establish themselves within the modern restaurant industry in the United States and Canada. Many of these individuals started with him either at his Steak and Ale chain beginning or met him during the establishment of Bennigan's in the 1970s. Others were with him during the time as president of Pillsbury's restaurants division or came up through the Chili's system under his watch. Some of the people who have worked with Brinker have gone on to oversee competing chains, such as Applebee's and T.G.I. Fridays. The vice president of OSI Restaurant Partners of Tampa, Florida, Joseph L. Jackson, began his career as a general manager of Steak and Ale who made a favorable impression with Brinker during his time with the company. Other restaurant chains and food service companies that Brinker directly or indirectly influenced include Boston Market, Flying J, Lettuce Entertain You, Sizzler, and many others. Outside of the restaurant business, former colleagues have taken the lessons they learned from him and gone into such divergent fields as human resources management, corporate and private investigations, and market research services using such programs as customer satisfaction surveys and mystery shopping. Nations Restaurant News has an award that honors Brinker. The Norman Award recognizes industry executives annually, who have inspired future leaders and has had \\"a significant impact\\" in their industry. Personal Brinker was born on June 3, 1931, in Denver, Colorado, as an only child. His parents, Kathryn and Eugene Brinker, later moved to a farm in Roswell, New Mexico. As a child, Norman took on odd jobs to supplement the family's modest income, creating a rabbit farm at the age of 10, managing a \\"120-mile-long\\" paper route and buying and selling horses to help make ends meet for the family. He attended Roswell High School and proceeded to attend the New Mexico Military Institute. He later served in the Navy, which brought him to San Diego, California. He later attended San Diego State College and graduated in 1957 at the age of 26. An avid and talented polo enthusiast, in 1952, Brinker was a member of the Olympic Equestrian team, competing in the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland, and later competed in the 1954 pentathlon competition at the world championships in Budapest. In June 1955, Brinker married tennis player Maureen \\"Little Mo\\" Connolly. The couple shared a passion for horses. Her professional tennis career ended due to a freak accident on a horse at the age of 18. They had two daughters, Cindy Brinker (Simmons), who was born in 1957, and Brenda Brinker (Bottum), who was born in 1959. Maureen died at the age of 34 on June 21, 1969, after a three-year-long battle with ovarian cancer.Klemesrud, 1985, \\"His first wife, Maureen (Little Mo) Connolly, the tennis star, died of ovarian cancer in 1969 at the age of 34.\\" The relationship between Norman and Maureen Brinker was depicted in a 1978 telefilm, Little Mo, which starred Glynnis O'Connor as Maureen, Mark Harmon as Norman, and Anne Baxter as Maureen's mother. Brinker married his second wife, Magrit L. Fendt, on March 7, 1971. Over the next five years, the couple had two children: Christina and Mark. The couple divorced in 1976. On February 14, 1981, Brinker married a third time, to Nancy Goodman, the former wife of Neiman Marcus executive Robert Leitstein. Goodman's son with Leitstein, Eric Blake Leitstein, took Brinker's surname after the marriage. The marriage provided Nancy with funding and an immediate network of financial and political support for the foundation dedicated to the memory of Nancy's sister, Susan G. Komen, which became the Susan G. Komen for the Cure and related Komen Race for the Cure. The couple were active Bush Pioneers, wealthy donors who provided $100,000 or more of financial support for George W. Bush's presidential ambitions. On January 22, 1993, Brinker was seriously injured during a polo match in a high-speed collision with another rider at the West Palm Beach Polo and Hunt Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. Suffering serious head injuries and in what was anticipated to be a prolonged coma, three days after the accident, Brinker was succeeded by Ron A. McDougall as chief executive officer of Brinker International; despite his retirement, Brinker retained the title of chairman emeritus. Some years after the accident, Norman and Nancy Brinker had an amicable divorce after 20 years of marriage and Nancy moved on to serve as the U.S. ambassador to Hungary early in the George W. Bush administration from 2001 to 2003. Norman Brinker remained a close advisor to Nancy Brinker in the years following their divorce. Brinker died on June 9, 2009, from aspiration pneumonia while on vacation in Colorado, six days after his 78th birthday.  Publications  *Brinker, Norman Donald T.

Baer (October 25, 1931 ‚Äì April 28, 2002) was a psychologist who contributed to the science of applied behavior analysis and pioneered the development of behavior analysis at two separate institutions. Baer is best known for his contributions at the University of Kansas. Throughout his career, he published over two hundred articles, books, and chapters on various psychological issues. Some of his most noteworthy contributions include literature on behavior-analytic theory, experimental design, and early childhood interventions. Baer received numerous awards during his lifetime which acknowledged his innovation and dedication to his field of research. Background information Donald M. Baer was born in St. Louis, Missouri on October 25, 1931. His father was a labor organizer which required his family to move frequently. Don later gained early admittance to the University of Chicago where he received his doctoral degree in 1957 under the direction of Jacob L. Gewirtz (Poulson, 2002). After graduation, Baer began working with Sidney W. Bijou at the University of Washington. Baer was soon offered a faculty position at the University of Kansas where he remained until his death on April 28, 2002. He is survived by his wife Elsie Pinkston and his three daughters. Early work Collectively, Baer and Bijou established the behavior analysis approach to child development at the University of Washington (Anonymous, 2002). From 1957 to 1965, Baer and Bijou conducted an array of research on the effects of reinforcement contingencies on children (Anonymous, 2002). An influential paper titled \\"Effect of withdrawal of positive reinforcement on an extinguishing response in young children\\" was written during this time (Baer, 1961). This research article established the effectiveness of \\"withdrawal of positive reinforcement\\" as a means of reducing behavior (Baer, 1961, p. 1). While at the University of Washington, Baer made another noteworthy research paper on the escape and avoidance behaviors of preschool children (Baer, 1960). Unfortunately, Baer and his research associates became involved in a \\"typical Psychology civil war\\" at the University of Washington (Baer, 1993., pp. 570). The war stemmed from the administration's \\"intolerance of Skinnerian perspectives and the rejection of research using single-subject designs.\\" (Horowitz, 2002., pp. 313). Seeking a university environment more welcoming of behavior analysis, Don Baer found his way to the newly formed Human Development and Family Life Department at the University of Kansas. The establishment of the Human Development and Family Life Department at the University of Kansas is a somewhat turbulent chain of events. The following comes from Baer (1993), unless otherwise stated. Due to various professors retiring, the University of Kansas decided to dissolve its Home Economics Department in the early 1960s. As a result, over $2 million in funding remained unused. A recently acquired academic researcher, Frances Horowitz, pleaded to the Kansas administration to simply transform the Home Economics Department into the Department of Human Development and Family Life. The Home Economics Department was already a well known childhood research center. The administration agreed and appointed Horowitz chair of the department. Horowitz assumed the task of recruiting researchers. Horowitz and Donald Baer had conversed at APA meetings for years and became great friends. At an APA meeting in Los Angeles, Horowitz asked Baer if he would be \\"interested in a challenge\\" (Baer, 1993. pp. 570). The challenge Horowitz was referring to was establishing a new doctoral program from the ground up. Don Baer remained at the department and began expanding the program to the highest degree. A fresh start At the University of Kansas, Baer began recruiting behavioral researchers for his newly formed department (Glover, pp. 146). Among those recruited, Baer began research with Montrose M. Wolf, Todd R. Risley, and James A. Sherman. The fruits of their research yielded the development of the discipline of applied behavior analysis (ABA) at the University of Kansas late in the 1960s. Applied behavior analysis concentrates on \\"empirically-based interventions into problems of individual, social, and cultural importance\\" (Anonymous, 2002, p. 1). This discipline provided a structure for working with developmentally delayed children and adults. According to Glover (1987), Baer established at Kansas \\"one of the outstanding centers for research in applied behavior analysis\\" (pp. 146). The following comes from Colman (1994), unless otherwise stated. Shortly after the establishment of ABA program, the first journal, Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, dedicated to the discipline was published in 1968. In the first issue, Baer, Wolf, and Risley (1968) published \\"Some current dimensions of applied behavior analysis\\". This groundbreaking article named seven definitive dimensions to the approach of behavior analysis. The seven dimensions state that \\"work in the field should be applied, behavioral, analytic, technological, conceptually systematic, effective and capable of generalized effects.\\" (pp. 406). Twenty years later, Baer et al. published an updated version, \\"Some still current dimensions of applied behavior analysis\\" (pp. 406). The seven dimensions had not changed, only elaborated on, throughout the years. Later work The following comes from Hains (1989), unless otherwise stated. Baer published hundreds of articles and books. He coauthored a paper with an associate, Ann H. Hains, in 1989 on experimental design entitled \\"Interaction effects in multi-element designs: Inevitable, desirable, and ignorable\\". In this paper, Baer addressed the single mindedness of the authors of single-subject research design books. He stated that these researchers only investigated the effectiveness of treatments in alteration and never examined whether the treatments interact. Baer proposed that single subject designs can and should be used to study not only separate effects but also interactions between the two conditions. Don Baer always seemed to be thinking ahead of his time. Developing new techniques and approaches for teaching developmentally delayed children was Baer's passion (Anonymous, 2002). He wrote many articles analyzing the current public education system and ways to improve their methods (Anonymous, 2002). The following comes from Warren et al. (1981), unless otherwise stated. One of his most read articles is titled \\"Generalization and maintenance of question-asking by severely retarded individuals\\". This article states the importance of establishing question asking strategies with developmentally-delayed children. Normal children develop simple question-asking (e.g. \\"What's that\\") in early infancy (pp. 15). Severely retarded children usually have great difficulty developing this skill. Initial training for this strategy is costly and time consuming for school systems. Despite the vast amount of time spent with the children, they can easily lose this ability. Baer and colleagues urged school systems to establish maintenance programs to help developmentally delayed children to continue and improve on their question-asking strategy. By maintaining this ability with the children, they will not only improve question-asking but save the school system valuable time and money from remedial training. Honors Donald M. Baer was an influential leader of the Department of Human Development and Family Life (later called the Department of Applied Behavioral Sciences) at the University of Kansas. He advised over 100 doctoral students while at Kansas, in addition to countless other graduate students. He contributed to the Bureau of Child Research, now known as the Schiefelbusch Life Span Institute (LSI). The program was successful, receiving years of funding from the National Institute of Mental Health. The Institute was also the first to obtain an award from the Society for the Advancement of Behavior Analysis (SABA) for its contributions to the field. Awards Baer won the Edgar A. Doll Award for his assistance to those with developmental disorders. In 1987 he was awarded the Don Hake Award from Division 25 of the American Psychological Association. In 1997, he won the award for Distinguished Service to Behavior Analysis from SABA. Baer served as president of the Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior from 1983 to 1984. He served as an editor for the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis (1970‚Äì1971). As well as serving as an associated editor of the American Journal of Mental Deficiency. Baer also spent much time traveling to other countries, including Australia, Japan, and Spain, while serving as a distinguished visiting professor. He died April 28, 2002 of heart failure in Lawrence, Kansas. His ashes are buried at Pioneer Cemetery in Lawrence, Kansas.

It was during this period, around 1908, that the University began the process of moving from what is now Pittsburgh's North Side to its current location in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh. At the time of this relocation, the university, then known as the Western University of Pennsylvania, also obtained an alteration to its charter in order to change its name to the University of Pittsburgh. These changes also corresponded with the celebration of the City of Pittsburgh's sesquicentennial and a rise in prominence of the university's athletic programs, exemplified by the undefeated and unscored upon football team of 1910, and led to crescendo and pride and optimism throughout the university. In this atmosphere, an abundance of music and chants extolling the newly renamed university appeared throughout student productions and publications. While some have faded into obscurity, among the most popular and pervasive of music and slogans, including \\"Hail to Pitt\\" and the \\"Alma Mater\\", were derived from the efforts of these students who were among the first to have \\"University of Pittsburgh\\" printed on their diplomas. =Origin of \\"Hail to Pitt\\"= Sheet music cover for a 1910 printing of \\"Hail to Pitt\\" \\"Hail to Pitt\\" is the most traditional of various fight songs of the University of Pittsburgh. Lyrics were written by George M. Kirk (Col. 1913) and music by Lester Milton Taylor (Eng. 1912), both of whom were members of the Beta Theta chapter of Sigma Chi at Pitt.Owl Yearbooks (1907-1980)Owl Yearbooks (1907-1980) The first performance of this song was in a production of the Cap and Gown Club, a student musical theatre company, titled Here and There in the spring of 1910. Kirk himself sung the performance of his song during this production which took place in the Carnegie Music Hall, in what was the first school year that the university had relocated to the Oakland section of Pittsburgh and the second academic year after the university changed its name from the Western University of Pennsylvania.University Courant (1888-1910)University Courant (1888-1910) The lyrics subsequently appeared, along with other fight songs, prior to the 1910 football season in the First Annual Football Year BookAssorted University of Pittsburgh Publications and the words and music were printed by Volkwein's Music and the song was copyrighted. Kirk, who served as a Pitt cheerleader for three years, helped push for the song's use as the Pitt fight song.George M. Kirk However, by the 1930s, the song's popularity led to issues with its use on radio broadcasts of games involving the school's successful football team. Because Pitt did not own the copyright to the song, permission for its use had to be obtained from the copyright owners prior to any broadcast. This led the university to commission and adopt a new song, the \\"Victory Song\\", to which the university owned the copyright and could freely grant permission for its use. However, \\"Hail to Pitt\\" continued to be performed and survived as the university's primary musical number. =Historic performances, recordings, and publication= In the early 1950s, the Pitt Band and the Pitt Men's Glee Club cooperated with the RCA Victor recording company to release a compilation of Pitt songs titled Songs of Pitt \\"Hail to Pitt\\" has been heard many times on local and national radio and television broadcasts and has been professional recorded several times throughout history by renowned musicians. It is believed that \\"Hail to Pitt\\" was the first college song to be broadcast on the radio when KDKA used it when airing its first football game. One of the first professional recordings of \\"Hail to Pitt\\", along with the university's \\"Alma Mater\\", was by the Criterion Quartet on Gennett Records in 1920.Gennett 1000 series Numerical Listings, accessdate=2009-02-11Labelliste von 'Gennett 10000 vis 10093', accessdate=2009-02-08 In 1925 \\"Hail to Pitt\\" was also one of seven fight songs comprising a compilation song titled \\"Collegiate Melody\\" that became a huge hit for Fred Waring & the Pennsylvanians.

'\\"Hail to Pitt\\" Lyrics The Pitt Band performs \\"Hail to Pitt\\" at a pep rally for the 1947 Pitt vs. Penn State football game The lyrics below represent the current lyrics to \\"Hail to Pitt\\" ascribed to by the Pitt Band. Note that \\"U-N-I\\" are sung as three distinct letters of the alphabet, not to be confused with the phrase \\"you and I.\\" The Pitt Men's Glee Club sings Hail to Pitt with the more traditional \\"Uni\\" (see Traditional Hail to Pitt Lyrics below). The lyrics stating \\"alleghenee, genec, genac, genac\\" reference the \\"Official University Yell\\" by 1891 graduate W. A. Johnston. The Yell itself is referencing the Allegheny Mountains of Western Pennsylvania. \\"Hail to Pitt\\" is believed to be the only college song to contain a college yell officially in its chorus.College yell in fight song, 1976 The Owl,pg. 211, accessdate=2009-02-11 The yell was selected to be the \\"Official University Yell\\" by an 1889 committee which also selected the official school colors of blue and gold. One of the first printed appearances of the \\"Official University Yell\\" occurred in an 1890 issue of the University Courant, a literary society magazine, which was also the first official year of the university's football team.University Courant, Vol. 4, No. 7, Oct. 1890, pg 98 The existence of the inclusion of this cheer in \\"Hail to Pitt\\" represents one of the few remaining student traditions still in widespread practice today that existed prior to the turn of the twentieth century and the 1908 name change. Down in Smokytown, in Pennsylvania, In Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, We've a University we're all proud of, Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh. She stands a mighty fortress 'neath her colors bright, Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, When forth she goes to battle 'gainst a stubborn foe This song will upward go: Hail to Pitt, hail to Pitt every loyal son! Hail to Pitt, hail to Pitt 'til the victory is won! The gold and blue shall wave forever On high through fair and stormy weather; We'll sing her praises far and wide Until the end of time! Hooperay, hooperay for dear old U-N-I; We'll give a grand old alleghenee, genac, genac, genac We'll wave and cheer for many a year And sing our songs out loud and clear For our university. (repeat Chorus) Often during sporting events, pep rallies, and various alumni and student functions, only the chorus is frequently played by the Pitt Band. It is usually paired with the other two widely performed fight songs of the University: the Pitt Victory Song and \\"The Panther\\" song. =Variations in lyrics= In some instances, slight differences can be found in the modern usage of the lyrics, including the replacement of the pronoun \\"her\\" when referring to the University with \\"our\\". A change in the lyrics was instituted on October 1, 1954, in an effort to support the city's \\"smoke control program\\" by eliminating the use of the term \\"smokeytown\\". The traditional first line: \\"Down in Smokeytown in Pennsylvania, in Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh\\" was eliminated and replaced with the following lyric: \\"Where the Allegheny meets the Ohio, in Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh\\". The replacement verse was chosen during a student congress sponsored contest. The winning submission was written by Ronald Amalong, who received a Pitt blazer for his efforts. The lyric was first sung by members of the Pitt Men's Glee Club during a ceremony attended by the city's mayor, David L. Lawrence, on the Bigelow Boulevard porch of the Cathedral of Learning during a pep rally for that season's football home opener. However, today the Pitt Band today still refers to the original lyrics on its website. Traditional lyrics The brass section of the Pitt Band blares out \\"Hail to Pitt\\" during a 14-7 Pitt football win over Syracuse University at Pitt Stadium in 1956. The lyrics below represent original traditional lyrics going back to but going back to a printing of the 1910 Annual Football Year Book and the 1916 edition of The Owl student yearbook.Owl Yearbooks (1907-1980) Some printings of the lyrics circa 1938 also appeared with a more generic lyric of \\"Hoop-hurray! Hoop-hurray for University\\" in the chorus. The first stanza focuses on the university's place in the City of Pittsburgh while the second stanza specifically mentions and focuses on football. This reinforces the attention on, and popularity of, the university's football team at the time of its writing. The season in which \\"Hail to Pitt\\" was written corresponded with the undefeated Pitt football team coach by Joseph H. Thompson that outscored its opponents 282-0. Down in Smokytown, in Pennsylvania, In Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, We have a University we're all proud of, Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh She stand a mighty fortress 'neath her colors bright, Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, When forth she goes to battle 'gainst a stubborn foe This song will upward go: CHORUS: Hail to Pitt! Hail to Pitt! every loyal son, Hail to Pitt! Hail to Pitt! 'til the victory is won, The Gold and Blue shall wave forever On high, through fair and stormy weather, We'll sing her praises far and wide Until the end of time; Hoop-hurray! Hoop-hurray for dear old Uni, Give her a grand old Allegheny-genac-genac-genac We'll wave and cheer for many a year And sing her songs out loud and clear, For our University. The Pitt Band, shown here during the 1952 football season in Pitt Stadium, would perform and sing \\"Hail to Pitt\\" at the end of each pre-game football show When the grand old days of football come around, In Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Her rooters at the field will make an awful sound, For Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Down across the field her mighty line moves on, For Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, They'll sweep the foe before them 'til the goal is won Then you'll hear them shout: Official University Yell One of the earliest printed appearances of Pitt's \\"Official University Yell\\" occurred in the October 1890 edition of the University Courant (Vol. 4, No. 7), a monthly publication of the Irving Literary Society of the then-named Western University of Pennsylvania (WUP). \\"Hail to Pitt\\" includes a reference to the Official University Yell by W. A. Johnston, class of 1891.Owl Yearbooks (1907-1980) The cheer was selected as the Official University Yell, along with blue and gold as the official colors of the University, by a committee in 1889. \\"Hail to Pitt\\" is believed to be the only college song to contain a college yell officially in its chorus. The official college yell of the University is as follows. Alle-genee-genac-genac, Alle-genee-genac-genac, Hoorah-Hoorah, Pitt! Prior to change of the university's name in 1908 from Western University of Pennsylvania to the University of Pittsburgh, the cheer appeared in the October 1890 edition of the University Courant this way: Alleghenee, genack, genack ! Alleghenee, genack, genack ! Hoorah ! Hoorah ! Wup ! Common Pitt songs \\"Hail to Pitt\\" is one of the primary parts of the University of Pittsburgh's musical pageantry, but many other songs about the University have been written over the years. Along with \\"Hail to Pitt\\", \\"The Panther\\", also known as \\"The Panther Song\\", is often paired with \\"Hail to Pitt\\" when performed. In addition, the Pitt \\"Victory Song\\" is also commonly played with \\"Hail to Pitt\\". These three songs typically form the primary montage of Pitt songs that is heard at university events and Pitt athletic contests. The University of Pittsburgh's \\"Alma Mater\\" will also commonly be played, typically to open or close these same events. The melodies of these four songs, if not the lyrics, are familiar to most fans, faculty, staff, and alumni of the university and, having been ingrained into the school's culture over the years, have become the primary musical tradition at Pitt. =The Panther song= Horace C. Scott wrote the lyrics for \\"The Panther\\" and also was the President of Pitt's Men's Glee Club Often paired with \\"Hail to Pitt\\" or the \\"Pitt Victory Song\\", the short \\"The Panther\\" is often used as an introduction to, or bridge, between them. Lyrics were written by Horace C. Scott (Dent. 1915), who was president of Men's Glee Club while at Pitt,The Owl (1916), pg. 366, University of Pittsburgh, accessdate=2009-02-15 and later served in the medical service of World War I.Chancellor's report for 1917, University of Pittsburgh, Chancellor, pg. 23, 1917, accessdate=2009-02-15 The music was written by Clarence S.

Allen Company of New York. During the 1940s, Joseph Wood conducted a recording of a collection of songs titled Songs of the University of Pittsburgh that featured Walter Scheff, Ralph Nyland, and Michael Stewart. Released on two 78-rpm discs by Republic records, the album featured \\"The Panther\\", as well as \\"Hail to Pitt\\", the \\"Victory Song\\", and the \\"Alma Mater\\". \\"The Panther\\" also appears with \\"Hail to Pitt\\" on Gameday Faves: Classic College Fight Songs Volume 10.Amazon.com: Panther Song Hail to Pitt (Live), accessdate=2009-02-08 Currently lyrics used in the \\"Panther Song\\" as currently taught to incoming Pitt Band freshmen are as follows: Old Pittsburgh's Glory Won't be trampled down today by any foe, foe, foe! For Pittsburgh's Glory, We'll fight you square, we'll play you fair at any game you know. And when the sun sets, You'll hear our good old dong of victory... Oh, when the Panther screams, you know the battle's just begun ‚Äî And if you don't look out, he'll surely get you on the run For Pittsburgh's Glory, And the honor of our University! Lyrics ascribed to the song from a 1927 Thornton W. Allen printing of an Intercollegiate Song Book vary slightly: One of four bronze Panther statues cast by Giuseppe Moretti in 1897 that guard Panther Hollow Bridge. To the right, Pitt's Cathedral of Learning can be seen in the background. Pittsburgh's glory won't be trampled down today by any foe, For Pittsburgh's glory we'll fight you square, we'll play you fair, at any game you know, And 'ere the sun sets you'll hear our good old song of victory. Oh, if the Panther screams it means a battle just begun, And if you don't watch out he'll get you on the run, For Pittsburgh's glory, And the honor of our University. =Victory Song= The \\"Victory Song\\" was originally created to solve the issue of the university not owning the copyright to \\"Hail to Pitt\\" which prevented the school from granting permission for its use during football radio broadcasts. The \\"Victory Song\\", which was written by three former Pitt students, proved to be popular and is still widely performed, often being paired with \\"Hail to Pitt\\" and the \\"Panther Song\\". The \\"Victory Song\\" prominently features the most commonly used cheer at Pitt athletic events: \\"Let's Go Pitt!\\" =Alma Mater= Performed in a less raucous nature than the fight songs, the official alma mater of the University of Pittsburgh is set to the tune of Joseph Haydn's 1797 anthem for the Austrian Emperor and since 1922 has served as the German National Anthem. Other Pitt songs and chants These school songs are seldom heard or used today, but are documented in various University publications. Together, they help tell the history of musical pageantry at the University of Pittsburgh, but have not enjoyed the popularity or longevity of \\"Hail to Pitt\\", the \\"Victory Song\\", \\"The Panther\\", and the Pitt \\"Alma Mater\\". One such song is \\"The Pitt Panther\\" whose music was written by Louis J. Panella in 1922 and whose lyrics were penned by Howard E. Reppert, class of 1923. \\"The Pitt Panther\\" was recorded on the album Pittsburgh On Parade by the River CIty Brass Band in 1993. Panella also wrote \\"Billy Pitt\\" around 1923 to go with a melody composed by C.V. Starrett, class of 1924. George Morrill Kirk, who wrote the lyrics for \\"Hail to Pitt\\", as wrote the lyrics and music to \\"Pittsburgh's Big Team\\" which was copyrighted in 1916. Horace C. Scott and C.S. Harris, who wrote \\"The Panther\\" song, also wrote \\"School Chant\\" (or \\"Chant\\") around 1915 and \\"The Battle Song\\" which was copyrighted in 1925. \\"Fight, Fight, Fight!\\" was penned by Richard M. Skidmore, medical school class of 1931. \\"Cheer for the Dear Old Lady\\" had lyrics by \\"G.M. P.B.\\", class of 1909 with music by \\"E.S.\\", class of 1921. Other known songs are as follows. =Pitt Fight Song= Although not one of the more predominantly performed songs of the university, \\"Pitt Fight Song\\", was written by Kenneth N. McKee, class of 1925. It is still occasionally performed by the Pitt Men's Glee Club.MP3 of Pitt Fight Song performed by the Pitt Men's Glee Club, previously at http://www.pittmensgleeclub.org/music/Pitt_Fight_Song.mp3 (no longer accessible), previous accessdate=2008-04-3 Dear Old Pittsburgh, dear Old Pittsburgh, Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight!

One could speculate that this song could have been in existence prior to the 1908 name change as the verses referring to \\"Pitt\\" could easily be exchanged with \\"Wup\\" or \\"W.U.P.\\" Whenever, wherever, Pitt men get together‚Äî Green Freshmen or gray-bearded Grads, Grave Jurists of years or gay young Engineers, Staid Doctors or frolicsome Lads, The Dentists, the Teachers, the Bankers, the Preachers, And prominent Men of the Day‚Äî Whenever, wherever, Pitt men get together, Someone is then sure to say: REFRAIN.

Let's give, let's give, let's give the 'Varsity Clap, Pittsburgh's slogan in every land‚Äî Give Old Alleghenee by hand; One-two-three  U. of P.

The class was created during the tenures of William P. Reid (Locomotive Superintendent) and Walter Chalmers (Chief Draughtsman) by rebuilding three earlier types, the \\"574\\", \\"633\\", and \\"729\\", which had all been designed by Matthew Holmes, and shared many features in common. A total of 48 were produced. The NBR Class M (later LNER Class D27 & D28) was an older but very similar type of 4-4-0 locomotive, commonly known as the Abbotsford class, Waverley class or \\"476\\", and a pioneering 4-4-0 design by Dugald Drummond. A total of 12 were produced. The engines were rebuilt (6 in 1902 and 6 in 1904) to become almost exact copies of the D31 engines. The only visible differences between the 1902 (D27) and 1904 (D28) designs were slight differences to the cab doors and windows. History Although both the Holmes and the Drummond engines were included in the class M designation when the NBR adopted formal class designations in 1913, the LNER did not consider the locomotives to be of the same class, and in 1923 (on grouping) the Holmes M class became LNER class D31, whilst the two types of Abbotsfords became LNER classes D27 and D28. The D31 type locomotives all passed to the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923 but one was withdrawn in 1931, and general withdrawals began in 1933, with only seven of the class passing to British Railways in 1948. The D27 & D28 type locomotives were withdrawn earlier. Five were scrapped pre-grouping, although the other seven passed to the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923. All were withdrawn by 1926, with none passing to British Railways at nationalisation. The common nickname \\"Abbotsfords\\" for the D27 and D28 locomotives is derived from the name of engine 479 (the fourth built). This engine was used in publicity photographs at the Cowlairs works when the locomotives were built, and these publicity photographs are believed to be the origins of the nickname. A 1:6 scale model of this engine was placed in the Royal Scottish Museum in Edinburgh in 1883. The alternative nickname \\"Waverley\\" was because the engines were introduced to handle express trains on the heavily-graded Waverley route from Edinburgh to Carlisle via Hawick. Build dates =Class M (D31)= The 574 series engines were constructed in 1884, with a total of 6 built. The 633 series engines numbered 24 locomotives in total, built from 1890 to 1895. The initial batch of 729 series engines was constructed in 1898, with 12 built; this was followed by a second batch of 6 engines the following year. All three types were reconstructed under Locomotive Supintendant William Reid, to form the Class M, with a total of 48 engines. =Class M (D27 and D28)= The NBRs earlier Abbotsford 4-4-0 locomotives (built 1877-1879) had been the railway's initial experiment with powerful express 4-4-0 engines, designed by Dugald Drummond. When these 12 engines were rebuilt, 6 in 1902 and 6 in 1904, they were left almost identical to the class M engines, and the NBR included them in the \\"Class M\\" designation, giving a total of 60 engines in the class. However, upon grouping in 1923 the LNER designated the 48 \\"true\\" Class M engines as class D31, but gave the rebuilt Abbotsford engines different designations - class D27 for the 1902 batch, and class D28 for the 1904 batch. Preservation The last D31 was withdrawn in December 1952 and none was preserved. The Abbotsford locomotives had been withdrawn earlier (the last D27 in 1924, the last D28 in 1926), and none was preserved.

Who are the Ahmadi Muslims and what do they believe? Waqar Ahmad Ahmedi gives a brief introduction to the Ahmadi branch of Islam.\\" Times Online. 27 May 2008. Ahmadis are considered non- Muslims by many mainstream Muslims since they consider Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the founder of the movement, to be the promised Mahdi and Messiah awaited by the Muslims. The Ahmadis are active translators of the Qur'an and proselytizers for the faith. However, in a number of countries, Ahmadis have faced strong resistance. In many Muslim-majority nations, Ahmadis have been considered heretics and non-Muslim, and subjected to persecution and systematic, sometimes state-sanctioned, oppression.\\"Localising Diaspora: the Ahmadi Muslims and the problem of multi-sited ethnography\\".

Hundreds of Ahmadis were killed in the 1953 Lahore riots and the 1974 Anti-Ahmadiyya riots. The May 2010 Attacks on Ahmadi mosques, infamously known as the Lahore Massacre, resulted in the murder of 84 Ahmadis by suicide attack. The 1974 riots resulted in the largest number of killings of Ahmadis. Pakistan The Shahada, the basic creed of Islam and of Ahmadi Muslims being erased by Pakistani police Approximately 2‚Äì5 million Ahmadis live in Pakistan, which has the largest population of Ahmadis in the world.The 1998 Pakistani census states that there are 291,000 (0.22%) Ahmadis in Pakistan. However, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has boycotted the census since 1974 which renders official Pakistani figures to be inaccurate. Independent groups have estimated the Pakistani Ahmadiyya population to be somewhere between 2 million and 5 million Ahmadis. However, the 4 million figure is the most quoted figure.

Although derogatory religious slurs, the terms 'Qadiani', 'Qadianism', 'Mirzai' and 'Mirzaian' are widely used in Pakistan to refer to Ahmadis and the term 'Qadiani' is also the term used by the government in its constitution. Ahmadis in Pakistan are also barred by law from worshipping in non-Ahmadi mosques or public prayer rooms, performing the Muslim call to prayer, using the traditional Islamic greeting in public, publicly quoting from the Quran, preaching in public, seeking converts, or producing, publishing, and disseminating their religious materials. These acts are punishable by imprisonment of up to three years. In applying for a passport or a national ID card, all Pakistanis are required to sign an oath declaring Mirza Ghulam Ahmad to be an impostor prophet and all Ahmadis to be non- Muslims.

There was severe agitations against the Ahmadis, including street protests, political rallies, and inflammatory articles. These agitations led to 200 Ahmadi deaths. Consequently, Governor-General Ghulam Muhammad implemented martial law and dismissed Pakistan's Federal Cabinet.\\"Pakistan: Jamaat-i- Islami\\". Library of Congress Country Studies. April 1994. =1974 riots and constitutional amendment= In 1974, a violent campaign, led mainly by the Majlis-e-Ahrar-e-Islam and Jamaat-e-Islami, began against the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in Pakistan, on the pretext of a clash between Ahmadis and non- Ahmadis at the railway station of Rabwah. This campaign resulted in several Ahmadi casualties and destruction of Ahmadiyya property, including the desecration of mosques and graves. As a result of pressure from this agitation, legislation and constitutional changes were enacted to criminalise the religious practises of Ahmadis by preventing them from claiming they are Muslim or from \\"behaving\\" as Muslims. These changes primarily came about due to the pressure of the Saudi King at the time, King Faisal bin As-Saud, according to Dr Mubashar Hassan, Prime Minister Bhutto's close confidant at the time.

In 1986 it was supplemented by a new blasphemy provisionPPC S. 295-C , inserted by Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1986 (III of 1986) also applied to Ahmadis.Cf. e.g. Khurshid Ahmad vs. The State, PLD 1992 Lahore 1 , para. 35 =Shab Qadar incident= The Shab Qadar incident was a public stoning of two members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in the town of Shab Qadar, in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan in April 1995.Amnesty International 8 April 1995, Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, page 82 of its Annual Report (1995) Dr. Rashid Ahmad and his son-in law, Riaz Ahmad Khan, were attacked as they were about to attend a court hearing in Shab Qadar. As they entered the court premises, a violent mob incited by local clerics attacked the men with sticks and stones.

The victims‚Äîsenior Ahmadiyya community members from Peshawar‚Äîhad come from the provincial capital to file a bail application for another Ahmadi Muslim, Daulat Khan. Daulat Khan had been harassed following his conversion to the sect. Local Muslim clergy reportedly called for his death. Daulat Khan had been arrested and imprisoned on 5 April 1995 under sections 107 (abetment) and 151 (disturbing the peace by joining in unlawful assembly) of the Penal Code. After the lynching of Rashid Ahmad and Riaz Ahmad Khan, Daulat Khan remained in custody and was further charged with posing as a Muslim and preaching Ahmadiyyat (section 298 C of the Penal Code) and insulting the religious sentiments of Muslims (section 295 A). =2000= On 30 October 2000, gunmen opened fire at an Ahmadiyya prayer meeting in the Pakistani province of Punjab, killing at least five worshippers and wounding another seven. =2005= In a 2005 survey in Pakistan, pupils in private schools of Pakistan expressed their opinions on religious tolerance in the country. The figures assembled in the study reflect that even in the educated classes of Pakistan, Ahmadis are considered to be the least deserving minority in terms of equal opportunities and civil rights. In the same study, the teachers in these elite schools showed an even lower amount of tolerance towards Ahmadis than their pupils.Peace and Democracy in South Asia, Volume 1, Number 1, January 2005. Passports to Privilege: The English-Medium Schools in Pakistan, Tariq Rahman. Ahmadis are harassed by certain schools, universities and teachers in Pakistan's Punjab province. The harassment includes social boycott, expulsions, threats and violence against Ahmadi students by extremist students, teachers and principals of the majority sect. On 7 October 2005, masked gunmen with Kalashnikov rifles stormed a mosque belonging to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in a village called Mong in Mandi Bahauddin, shooting dead eight people and wounding 14. =2008= Two prominent members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community were murdered on 8 and 9 September 2008 after a program by Aamir Liaquat Hussain provoking people to kill Ahmadis was aired on a prominent Pakistani television channel Geo TV a day earlier on 7 September. =2009= During the year 2009, eleven Ahmadis were killed, while numerous others became victims of attempted killings, according to a report titled \\"Persecution of Ahmadis in Pakistan during the year 2009\\" published by Nazarat Umoor-e-Aama Sadr Anjuman Ahmadia Pakistan. The report claimed that the actions of \\"Ahmadi opponents\\" had been encouraged largely by the prejudiced attitude of the authorities, and alleged that the federal government had been in denial of the human rights and religious freedom of the Ahmadis, especially the governments of Punjab and Azad Jammu and Kashmir. =2010= 28 May 2010 saw the worst single incident of violence against Ahmadis to date (see May 2010 attacks on Ahmadi mosques in Lahore), when several members of an extremist religious group (allegedly Tehrik-i-Taliban Punjab) entered two Ahmadi mosques in Lahore and opened fire; three of them later detonated themselves. In total, the attacks claimed the lives of 86 people and injured well over 100. The members were gathered in the mosques attending Friday services. In response to the attacks, Pakistan minister for minorities Shahbaz Bhatti visited the Ahmadi community. ;April Around 10 pm on 1 April 2010, three Ahmadis were returning home in their vehicle from their jewellery and cloth shops situated in Rail Bazaar in Faisalabad. As their car approached the Canal Road near Faisal Hospital, four or five unidentified militants in a white car ambushed them. The three Ahmadis were seriously injured when the men opened fire at them. The attackers managed to flee from the scene. The three men died before they reached the hospital. ;May Lahore attacks On 28 May 2010, two mosques in Lahore belonging to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community were attacked by the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan Punjab Wing (Punjabi Taliban). The attacks were carried out nearly simultaneously at Mosque Darul Al Zikr, Garhi Shahu and Mosque Bait Al Noor Lahore Model Town, 15 km apart. More than 90 people were killed and 108 were injured in the incident. One attacker was killed; another was captured by worshipers. Three days later militants attacked the Intensive Care Unit of Lahore's Jinnah Hospital, where victims and one of the alleged attackers were under treatment. Twelve people, mostly police officers and hospital staff, were killed in the shootout. The assailants escaped. The Pakistani government did nothing to prevent this; as of yet they have not set up protection for Ahmadis. As of 28 May 2013 the two attackers captured had not been prosecuted, but early in 2015 courts took up the case and proceeded with sentencing. On 31 May 2010, an Ahmadi was stabbed to death and his son seriously injured when an assailant climbed the wall of their house with a dagger and attacked them. The son later died in hospital from serious wounds. The attacker escaped. Residents say that the assailant threatened to not leave any Ahmadi alive after having found motivation to kill them through a sermon given by a local Sunni cleric. ;September On 3 September 2010, an Ahmadiyya Mosque in Mardan was attacked during Friday Prayers by a terrorist when he opened fire at the Ahmadi guards there on duty. The guards fired back, injuring him. He threw grenades inside the mosque and later detonated his suicidal vest. The attack left one Ahmadi dead and 3 injured.http://ahmadiyyaarchive.org/video/zrLIWQWNZEs/attempt-of- suicide-attack-at-ahmadi-mosque-mardan-3-sep-10|url-status=live} =2011= On 7 September 2011, the mainstream Urdu newspaper Daily Jang published a special edition against Ahmadis. Throughout the year, Ahmadi students and teachers in the Pakistan's Punjab province have been systematically persecuted by schools and universities. The harassment has included social boycott, expulsions, threats and violence by students, teachers and principals of the Muslim majority sect. In education Ahmadi students faced discrimination in Pakistan in 2011 because of their faith. =2012= In Faisalabad, Quranic verses were removed from Ahmadi graves by the police. 3 December 2012, In Lahore over 100 tombstones at an Ahmadiyya graveyard in Lahore were desecrated in the wee hours of Monday by masked gunmen, who specifically targeted graves with Islamic inscriptions. They proclaimed themselves members of a banned organisation, and said the Ahmadiyyas had no right to use Quranic verses on their gravestones, as they \\"are not Muslims.\\" The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) condemned the destruction of over 100 tombstones at an Ahmadi graveyard on Monday and demanded the arrests of those responsible. Anti- Ahmadiyya sentiment in media Islamic fundamentalism and Islamic extremism existed in the Pakistani media, causing them to start a hate campaign against Ahmadis. =2013= 7 January 2013: Four Ahmadi employees of Black Arrow Printing Press accused of publishing allegedly blasphemous books, were arrested as they loaded a small truck with thousands of books and CDs.om.pk/story/502777/ahmadi-literature-printing-press-employees-accused-of- blasphemy/ 26 March 2013: Local clerics attacked a house belonging to an Ahmadi family in the Shamsabad, a village of Kasur district of Punjab on Tuesday and subjected the family members to violence allegedly over their religious belief. The five members of Mansoor's family tried to take refuge in a room but the mob broke into the room as well. Mansoor was severely tortured, after which he lost consciousness, while his wife and his 70-year-old uncle were also beaten. Police personnel were reportedly present at the spot but took no action against the mob. International Human Rights Commission Punjab Director General Munawar Ali Shahid said, \\"Several people here have told me that the Ahmadis had been socially boycotted for long. Police have taken no action to stop violence against them.\\". 30 April 2013: In Lahore, Gulshan-i- Ravi police arrested seven members of the Ahmadi community on Monday without an FIR, after close to 300 people protested in front of what was described as a place of worship of the community. A woman and her 10-year-old son were also arrested No, although no female members of the police accompanied them. 8 May 2013: Members of the Khatm-e-Nabuwat Lawyers Forum (KNLF) (anti-Ahmadi activists) and police dragged five members of the Ahmadi community from an anti-terrorist court to a police station and detained them for several hours. =2014= May 2014: American-Canadian Doctor Mehdi Ali Qamar, was gunned down in Rabwah while visiting Punjab, Pakistan to help train local doctors. 100 Ahmadiyas took refuge in China after their lives were in danger in Pakistan. *Three members of the same family including one woman and two minors were killed and nine other people were injured when an angry mob set a house on fire in Arafat Colony, Gujranwala. =2015= On the Friday evening of 20 November 2015, a large mob, in an alleged case of blasphemy, torched down a chipboard factory, in Jhelum, Punjab, Pakistan. Ahmadi Muslim employees were accused of desecrating the Quran. The following day, rioters gathered in Kala Gujran, a town bordering Jhelum, and burned an Ahmadiyya mosque and a number of homes belonging to Ahmadi Muslims. Although no casualties have been reported, Ahmadi Muslims have been arrested, against whom a blasphemy case has been registered. =2016= A mob of around 1,000 people besieged an Ahmadi place of worship in Chakwal and had to be dispersed by police. Deputy Commissioner Chakwal Mahmood Javed Bhatti said the mob hurled stones and bricks at the place of worship before storming the building, adding that gunmen opened fire on Ahmadis in the area. The DC said that police dispersed the crowd and secured the building. =2017= In an address to the National Assembly, Captain Safdar Awan, the son-in-law of deposed PM Nawaz Sharif, demanded strict restrictions against Ahmadis, calling for complete curbs on Ahmadis in government, army, and private employment. He similarly questioned whether Ahmadis could be loyal to Pakistan. On 12 October 2017, 3 Ahmadis were sentenced to death for blasphemy after tearing down posters that allegedly contained anti-Ahmadi slogans, though prosecutors argued the posters carried religious significance. On 20 October, an anti-Ahmadi rally attracted 10,000 people where Ahmadis were denounced as \\"infidels\\" and \\"enemies of the state\\". After a row regarding barriers to Ahmadi's participation in elections, the Pakistani government took out ads reaffirming a religious oath requiring elected officials to vow that they do not follow anyone claiming to be a prophet after Mohammad and \\"nor do I belong to the Qadiani group\\", using a common derogatory term for Ahmadis. =2018= Azad Jammu and Kashmir Twelfth Amendment On 6 February 2018, the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly approved an amendment declaring Ahmadis to be non- Muslims.  February  On 8 March 2018, Islamabad's High Court issued a judgement against Ahmadi Muslims and minorities which resulted in four major incidents against Ahmadis in Pakistan. The High Court ordered all citizens applying for any type of government job to declare their religious beliefs. Western human rights organisations have stated that this order is an attack on persecuted minorities in Pakistan, as well as a method to intercept Ahmadi politicians.  May  On 24 May 2018, a mob of several hundred people in Sialkot, Pakistan attacked and demolished a historic and culturally significant 100-year-old Ahmadi mosque. Reports of collusion between the mob and local government officials were published, but police denied such accusations. A video on social media showed a crowd cheering on a local cleric who stated \\"I want to thank the Sialkot administration, the DPO (District Police Officer), DC (District Commissioner), the TMA (Town Municipal Corporation), from the bottom of my heart\\". The US, UK and international community strongly condemned this attack.  June  On 27 June 2018, in a hate crime linked to the 8 March High Court judgement, an Ahmadi was killed in Nishtar Colony, Lahore.  July  On 9 July 2018, five Ahmadi Muslims in Karachi, Pakistan were shot in two incidents of hate crime. Three were injured and two were killed. In the first attack, an Ahmadi couple were attacked in their home, the wife was shot in the thigh by attackers. In the second attack, Mubeen Ahmed, 20, was killed by robbers entering his office, and two colleagues were injured.  August  On 24 August, the second day of Eid, an Ahmadi Mosque in Ghaseetpura, Faisalabad was burnt down, resulting in 30 people being injured out of which 6 were Ahmadi. Reports suggest that the violence was initiated due to a \\"petty dispute\\" over roosters. = 2019 = On 25 October, parts of a historic 70-year-old Ahmadi Mosque in the Murad District of Bahawalpur was demolished without notice and the Ahmadis who recorded it were charged by Police. The demolition was led by Mohammad Tayyab, Assistant Commissioner of Hasilpur. = 2020 =  July  On 1 July, an Ahmadi graveyard in Chak No-79 Nawa Kot, District Sheikhupura was vandalised where Ahmadi graves were desecrated. On 13 and 14 July, Ahmadi graves were desecrated by police following a protest by religious extremists in Tirigri village, Gujranwala. =Persecution of Ahmadi students= Ahmadi students have faced extremist persecutions because of their faith in most popular universities and colleges of Pakistan including University of Sargodha. Other countries =Afghanistan= Persecution of Ahmadis in Afghanistan began in the early 20th century within the lifetime of Ghulam Ahmad, the founder of the movement. Abdur Rahman, a disciple of Sayyid Abdul Latif of Khost ‚Äì a reputable religious scholar who was the tutor and adviser on religious affairs to the Prince (later Amir) Habibullah Khan ‚Äì visited Qadian upon the latter's instruction. Having stayed there in the company of Ghulam Ahmad for some time and having pledged allegiance to him he returned to Afghanistan where he began preaching against the common notion of Jihad as war. This information eventually reached the King, Amir Abdur Rahman Khan, who had him arrested and he was later strangled to death while in prison. It is not clear however whether this was a state-sanctioned execution or simply murder. He is considered the first martyr of Ahmadiyya Islam.Adil Hussain Khan. \\"From Sufism to Ahmadiyya: A Muslim Minority Movement in South Asia\\" Indiana University Press, 6 April 2015 p 130 About two years later, Abdul Latif himself visited Qadian before starting on the hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca) and stayed there for a few months also joining the Ahmadiyya movement before returning to Afghanistan in 1903 to proselytise to his King, Amir Habibullah Khan. Upon reaching Khost, he wrote to some courtiers who decided to have him arrested and brought to Kabul. He was put to trial and examined, first by the Amir, then by Sirdar Nasrallah Khan, another leading cleric, and then by a jury of twelve religious clerics, only two of whom gave a verdict of apostasy against him which carried the death penalty in Afghanistan. The Amir thus charged him with apostasy.Frank A. Martin. \\"Under the Absolute Amir\\" Harper & Brothers, 1907 p 203-4Adil Hussain Khan. \\"From Sufism to Ahmadiyya: A Muslim Minority Movement in South Asia\\" Indiana University Press, 6 April 2015 p 131 On 14 July 1903, after being repeatedly asked to renounce his beliefs and recant and refusing to do so, he was stoned to death before a large crowd. Frank A. Martin, the English Engineer-in-Chief to the government of Afghanistan at the time, who had witnessed the execution, giving an account of it in his book Under the Absolute Amir, writes: Ahmadis see in the cholera epidemic that Kabul experienced within a month of the stoning, a sign of his and the movement's truth.Argument Number 10 ‚Äì Prophecies: Prophecy No. 1: Afghan martyrs By the 1920s, nearly ten Ahmadis were stoned to death in AfghanistanAdil Hussain Khan. \\"From Sufism to Ahmadiyya: A Muslim Minority Movement in South Asia\\" Indiana University Press, 6 April 2015 p 133 and it is reported that a total of about three Ahmadis had been executed in Kabul during this period. In the 1920s, King Amanullah Khan had several Ahmadiyya members forcibly reverted, and in 1924 affiliation with the Ahmadiyya became a capital offense.Vincent Littrell. [Islam: Ahmadiyya]. World Association of International Studies, 17 February 2006 Since then, no Ahmadiyya Muslims have been reported in Afghanistan, but a possibility of their existence remains.Yohanan Friedmann: Prophecy Continuous: Aspects of Ahmadi Religious Thought and Its Medieval Background, Oxford University Press India 2003, pg 26‚Äì29 =Algeria= In March 2016, Algerian authorities refused an attempt by Ahmadis to register as an association under Algerian law. In June 2016, a planned Ahmadi mosque was raided and shut down in Larbraa. Since March 2016, more than 280 Ahmadis have been arrested and have faced prosecution. Algerian officials have publicly called Ahmadis heretics and a threat to Algeria. In June 2016, The Minister of Religious Affairs and Endowments, Mohamed Aissa, described Ahmadi presence in Algeria as part of a \\"prepared sectarian invasion\\". In February 2017, he stated that Ahmadis are \\"not Muslim.\\" In April 2017, Ahmed Ouyahia, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika's chief of cabinet called on Algerians to \\"preserve the country from the Shia and Ahmadiyya sects\\".Algeria: Wave of arrests and prosecutions of hundreds of Ahmadis Amnesty International. 19 June 2017 =Bangladesh= In Bangladesh, Ahmadis have been targeted by various protests and acts of violence, and fundamentalist Islamic groups have demanded that Ahmadis be officially declared kafirs (infidels).Rahman, Waliur. \\"Violent Dhaka rally against sect\\". BBC News. 23 December 2005. Some adherents of Ahmadiyya have been subject to \\"house arrest\\" and several have been killed. In late 2003 several large, violent marches, led by Moulana Moahmud Hossain Mumtazi, were directed to occupy an Ahmadi mosque. In 2004, all Ahmadiyya publications were banned.\\"Bangladesh: The Ahmadiyya Community ‚Äì their rights must be protected\\". Amnesty International. 22 April 2004. 12 February 2019 Ahmadiyya Muslim community is attacked by Radical Islamist group in Bangladesh. ISIS claimed the attack. =Belarus= In 2007, the Ahmadiyya Muslims were banned from practising their faith openly in the state of Belarus and given a similar status to other banned religious groups in the country. Unable to obtain state registration, Ahmadi Muslims in the country who number about 30 including 13 native Belarusians, cannot conduct their activities formally as a collectivity such as importing or distributing literature, gathering together for prayers or meetings and having an official representative. =Belgium= In 2011 the far right party Vlaams Belang organized a demonstration against the projected building of an Ahmadi mosque in the Brussels municipality of Uccle, allegedly out of fear for a \\"war of religions\\" between radical Sunnis and Ahmadis in the streets of the municipality. \\"Le Vlaams Belang manifeste contre la construction d‚Äôune mosqu√©e \\", Le Soir, 13 October 2011 =Bulgaria= In 2003, persistent attempts were made in Bulgaria by a local prosecutor and the national state Religious Affairs Directorate to strip Ahmadi Muslims of their legal status. Ahmadis in Bulgaria, who (at the time) claimed some 400 members across the country, were refused registration as a religious community on the grounds that they were \\"against the religions that people follow here\\" and that \\"other countries ‚Äì such as Pakistan ‚Äì also attack the religious freedom of Ahmadis, who are considered to be heretical by many Muslims\\". Failing to obtain a legal status, the Ahmadiyya community decided to seek registration as a non-commercial organisation with the Blagoevgrad Regional Court, where one of its biggest congregations is based. This too was rejected on the grounds that \\"the community had been denied registration as a religion\\" and that \\"only registered religious communities are allowed to create non-commercial entities to promote their faith\\". However, the community was able to successfully challenge this latter decision and gained registration as such in December 2005. Subsequently, their legal status as a non-commercial organisation was again opposed by the Religious Affairs Directorate and the Regional Prosecutor's Office lodged a suit to the regional court calling for it to revoke the registration. The Bulgarian authorities citied the Pakistani government's legal measures against the Ahmadis as a reason to restrict their rights also. Most human rights and religious freedom activists have seen this denial of registration to the Ahmadi community as an exception. =Egypt= There has been a recent rise of persecution of Ahmadis in Egypt. In March 2010, nine Ahmadis were detained for allegedly insulting Islam. =Gambia= Since its earliest history in the Gambia in the 1950s, Ahmadis have continued to face resistance and religious intolerance from certain Muslim clerics and Islamic bodies in the country. More recently, in 2014, a leading Gambian Muslim cleric, Alhaji Abdoulie Fatty, who was also the Imam of the State House of the Gambia at that time, called for the expulsion of Ahmadi Muslims from the country. Having described Ahmadi Muslims as non-Muslims, he called for a ban on the propagation of Ahmadiyya teachings in the Gambia. In January 2015, the government-financed Gambia Supreme Islamic Council aired on state television and other state and print media its decision to declare the Community, as a non-Muslim group. The move was condemned by Baba Trawally, the Ameer (National President) of the Gambian Ahmadiyya community and Demba Ali Jawo, former president of the Gambia Press Union. =India= In India, Ahmadis are Muslims by law. This is supported by a verdict from the Kerala High Court on 8 December 1970 in the case of Shihabuddin Imbichi Koya Thangal vs K.P. Ahammed Koya, citation A.I.R. 1971 Ker 206. In this landmark ruling, the court determined that Ahmadis are Muslims and that they cannot be declared apostates by other Muslim sects because they hold true to the two fundamental beliefs of Islam: that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is a messenger of God. While Ahmadis are considered Muslims by law and there are no legal restrictions on their religious activities, they are not permitted by fellow Muslims of other sects to sit on the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, a body of religious leaders that the Indian government recognises as representative of Indian Muslims. 2008 Ahmadis were denied permission to meet in Hyderabad because of the protests from the Islamic groups. On 19 August 2008 Islamic cleric named Maulvi Habib-ur-Rehman incited hatred for the people in a rally. On the night of 21/22 August 2008, three Ahmadis were attacked. Their properties were damaged. In all, six persons were attacked. 2009 In Chennai, the body of a 36-year-old Ahmadi woman of the community was exhumed and desecrated by \\"anti-social elements\\" from a graveyard. at Royapettah on 1 June. Ahmadis alleged the police intervention in this issue. They did a press conference. They told the detailed of the incident and persecution faced by Islamic clerics. Madras High Court has ruled that Ahmadis are Muslims. Muslims led by Shahi Imam Habib-ur-Rehman Sani protested against Jalsa Salana. Muslims all across the state have joined hands in the protests. Indian finance minister Pranab Mukerjee was likely to attend the Jalsa Salana. Muslims damaged his office and blocked the traffic for stopping the annual convention of Ahmadis. Police imposed curfew for three days. Many people were injured and one Sikh died. When the convention was held, the protestors presented anti-Ahmadiyya document to the chief commissioner to be forwarded to Prakash Singh Badal. The protest was organized in all the big mosques of Punjab. 2010 Islamic clerics threatened the Mayawati government to remove mentions of the Ahmadiyya sect from the syllabus. 2011 In Mumbai, Darul Uloom Deoband asked Saudi Arabia's government to ban Ahmadis from the hajj. The spokesperson said that Ahmadis do not believe in the finality prophethood therefore they cannot perform the hajj. They sent a letter to the government. In New Delhi, Ahmadis faced protests from rival Muslim sects for attempting to preach their religion. They faced protests from the Muslims of India. All India Muslim Personal Law Board's members were also among the protesters. Ahmadis changed the timings of the convention. Maulana Bukhari and his protestors were detained in a police station for protesting against this. 2012 In February 2012, the Andhra Pradesh Wakf Board took a series of unprecedented decisions and asked the qazis in the state not to perform marriages for those belonging to Ahmadiyya community. In Hyderabad, an anti-Ahmadiyya mob attacked the mosque and said to stop the prayers. They also threw stones at the mosque. =Indonesia= In June 2008, a law was passed to curtail proselytising by Ahmadiyya members. An Ahmadiyya mosque was burned. Human rights groups objected to the restrictions on religious freedom. On 6 February 2011 some Ahmadiyya members were killed at Pandeglang, Banten province. In the past few years there has been an increase in attacks on religious freedom, including incidents of physical abuse, preventing groups from performing prayers, and burning their mosques. Data from the Setara Institute for Democracy and Peace show 17, 18, and 64 incidents for the years 2008, 2009 and 2010 respectively. Although the data cover persecution of all religions, the recent persecution of Ahmadis is significant and severe, followed by persecution of Christians and persecution of other Islamic sects who claim to be \\"genuine/pure/fundamentalist Muslims\\". As of 2011, the sect faces widespread calls for a total \\"ban\\" in Indonesia.McGeown, Kate. \\"Islamic sect Ahmadiyah faces ban in Indonesia\\" BBC. 21 April 2011. (Video) On 6 February 2011, hundreds of mainstream Muslims surrounded an Ahmadiyya household and beat three people to death.

Al Jazeera. 29 July 2010 2011 On 6 February 2011 three (originally reported as six, and later amended) Ahmadiyya members were killed at Pandeglang, Banten province, in a clash between locals. While the government did instruct police to hunt the killers, it also called on Ahmadiyya to abide by the 2008 decree and stop spreading their belief. In July 2011 the prosecuting sought sentences of between five and seven months for the defendants, an act that caused outcry by rights activists. The verdict given was between three and six months, slightly lighter than sought. This has trigger criticism from human right defenders and the international community including the US and the EU. In addition, a Cikeusik Ahmadi leader, Deden Darmawan Sudjana, was also sentenced to six months in prison for physical abuse and acts against the state, refusing an order from a police officer who told him to leave the house. A US State Department spokeswoman said they were \\"disappointed\\" with the verdict, while an activist of the New York-based Human Rights Watch, called it \\"the Talibanization of Indonesia\\". =Malaysia= In April 2009, the Selangor Islamic Religious Council of Malaysia issued a letter that forbade members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community from offering Friday prayers at their central mosque. Moreover, Ahmadis failure to comply with the order would result in imprisonment of up to one year and/or a fine up to 3000 Malaysian ringgit. A large notice outside the mosque states Qadiani Bukan Agama Islam, which translates to Qadiani [Ahmadiyyat] is not Islam. =Palestine= Ahmadis were reported to be persecuted in the Palestinian Authority-controlled areas in 2010. In 2010, Mohammed Sharif Odeh, head of the Ahmadi community in Israel, told Arutz Sheva radio that the Palestinian Authority is \\"encouraging the cold-blooded murder of Ahmadis\\" by failing to take concrete action to protect the community. =Saudi Arabia= Ahmadis are persecuted in Saudi Arabia on an ongoing basis. In a 2006‚Äì2007 nationwide campaign to track down and deport Ahmadi Muslim foreign workers, the Saudi religious police arrested 56‚Äì60Depending on the source there were 56‚Äì60 Ahmadis arrested in the years 2006‚Äì2007 Although there are many foreign workers and Saudi citizens belonging to the Ahmadiyya sect in Saudi Arabia, Ahmadis are officially banned from entering the country and from performing the hajj and umrah pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina. On 24 January 2007, Human Rights Watch sent an open letter to the Saudi king King Abdullah asking him to cease religious persecution of the Ahmadi faith in Saudi Arabia. Two letters were sent in November 2006 and February 2007 asking him to remove the travel ban on critics of the Saudi government. In May 2012, Saudi authorities arrested two Saudi Sunni Muslim citizens for their conversion to Ahmadiyya Islam.U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, International Religious Freedom Report for 2012: Saudi Arabia (20 May 2013). They were arrested three months after joining the Ahmadiyya and refusing to abandon their beliefs. As of May 2014, the two accused of apostasy had served two years in prison awaiting trial. They have not been released since then.HAW urges Saudi to free two Ahmadis held for apostasy, The Daily Star, Lebanon News (15 May 2014). =Singapore= =United Kingdom= Ahmadis in the UK have endured killings, mass protests by other Muslims against Ahmadi mosque construction, and threats and intimidation. In March 2016, the First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, attended the wake of an Ahmadi, Asad Shah, 40, killed by a Sunni, Tanveer Ahmed, 32, in what the police characterised as \\"religious prejudice\\".Asad Shah: Nicola Sturgeon joins 500 people at vigil as defiant locals declare 'This is not who we are' dailyrecord.co.uk 25 March 2016. In April 2016, leaflets calling for death to Ahmadis were found in Stockwell Green mosque. The mosque claimed that it was unaware of the leaflets being placed on its premises. The leaflets were authored in the name of an ex- head, Yusuf Ludhianvi, of Khatme Nubuwwat Academy ‚Äì an anti-Ahmadiyya organization. The organization is fully known as Almi Majlis-e-Tahafuz Khatmi Nubuwat or the International Committee for the Protection of the Finality of Prophethood. 2009 In 2009 a demonstration consisting of mainly Muslims was held in Walsall to prevent Ahmadis acquiring a mosque. 2010 The UK-based Ummah Channel broadcast three interactive programmes against Ahmadis in the wake of Lahore massacre. Ofcom criticized Ummah Channel for doing this. In 2010, in the wake of the May 2010 attacks on two Ahmadi mosques in Lahore, Pakistan, members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community living in the UK were threatened and intimidated. Certain Muslim groups in South London distributed leaflets asking readers to kill Ahmadis and boycott their businesses, and Ahmadi mosques in Crawley and Newham were vandalised. In October 2010 Ofcom criticised the UK-based Ummah Channel for broadcasting three interactive television programmes before and after the Lahore massacre of Ahmadi Muslims in May 2010, in which religious leaders and callers alike said that Ahmadis should be killed. These programmes were repeated several times. Ofcom stated that the programme's abusive treatment of the religious views and beliefs of members of the Ahmadiyya community breached UK broadcasting regulations. Nasser Butt, a Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate for the general election was targeted by a campaign that asked Muslims not to vote for him because of his faith. In the election, hustings in the Tooting Islamic centre, a Conservative candidate, Mark Clarke, was mistaken for Butt and had to be locked in a room for his safety. Imam Suliman Gani, of the (Sunni) Tooting Islamic Centre, called for a boycott of Ahmadi shops, stating: \\"Since the Qadianis are routinely deceptive about their religion, there was a potential risk of Muslims being offered meat that wasn't necessarily halal.\\" 2016 =Murder of Asad Shah= In March 2016, an Ahmadi Scottish shopkeeper Asad Shah was stabbed to death in Glasgow after wishing people a Happy Easter on social media. On 29 March 2016, the murderer's name was revealed as Tanveer Ahmed. On 6 April 2016, Tanveer Ahmed stated \\"that he killed Asad Shah,\\" and claimed \\"if I had not done this others would\\". An Ahmadi anti-extremism campaign was launched in Glasgow, with attendance of Ahmadi Muslims, Christian, Sikh, and Jewish leaders, but no Muslims belonging to other sects. The murderer pleaded guilty to the \\"religiously-motivated murder.\\" Part of the family of the victim is emigrating away from Scotland. =Hate leaflets= In April 2016, leaflets were distributed across London's universities, mosques and shopping centres, calling for the killing of Ahmadis.

Williams III. The story involves the Justice League of America recast in assorted roles in the Wild West. Wonder Woman is a Marshal, Booster Gold is a Maverick-style gambler, and Wally West is an outlaw, wrongly accused of the death of Barry Allen. Ted Kord is an inventor wearing a pair of antennae. Guy Gardner is a Pinkerton detective hunting Flash. Hawkman and Martian Manhunter also appear. There is also a cameo at the end by Clark Kent, as a dime novel writer. Maxwell Lord is the villain, prefiguring his eventual unmasking as a criminal mastermind out to destroy meta-humans in actual DC continuity years later. Plot 1873: US Marshall Diana Prince's hometown, Paradise, is destroyed by Professor Felix Faust, an alcoholic \\"sorcerer\\" who also murders Diana's mentor, Sheriff Oberon. She vows to avenge Paradise's townspeople and asks for the help of Wally West, the Kid Flash, a gunslinger with above-average reflexes; and Katar Johnson, a Cheyanne Indian warrior also known as \\"Hawkman\\", who can fly with artificial wings. They then set to El Inferno, the headquarters of Faust's employer, railroad baron Maxwell Lord. On their way there, they are attacked by mechanical gunslingers sent by Lord and saved by Michael Carter, the Booster Gold, a mercenary outfitted with powerful guns devised by an eccentric inventor, Ted \\"Beetle\\" Kord. They agree to join Diana in their quest. As they near El Inferno, the Justice Riders are joined by J'onn Jones, an old friend of Diana's and an alien searching for Lord's \\"secret weapon\\". They are followed by Guy Gardner, a Pinkerton Agency private investigator who wants to arrest Kid Flash for the death of a lawman called Barry Allen. Upon arriving at El Inferno, the Justice Riders face off against Lord, Faust and their mechanical soldiers. Diana, Hawkman, Jones and Kid Flash destroy the robots while Booster Gold and Blue Beetle fight Gardner. Suddenly, they are attacked by Lord, piloting a powerful war machine called the Lordevastator. El Inferno is nearly destroyed in the battle, but Diana manages to destroy the Lordevastator. Lord claims that he is Earth's rightful heir and reveals that he has been destroying several small towns such as Paradise to open way for a railroad that will allow Lord to transport his war machines to strategic points of the United States and slowly take over the world. Diana kills him while Kid Flash and Gardner, who were fighting each other, briefly team-up to shoot Faust, who tried to kill them with a shotgun. Gardner agrees to allow Kid Flash to escape this one time, but vows that he'll capture him eventually before riding off. Kid Flash decides to hide in Mexico, while Hawkman returns to the Indian reserve where he lives and Jones uncovers the source of Lord's advanced technology: a Dominion alien trapped in a cage. He decides to return the being to its homeworld, while Diana returns to Paradise intending to rebuild it and Booster Gold searches for new jobs in Alabama. Blue Beetle returns to his old town and sells the story to dime writer Clark Kent in order to use the money to finance his inventions. And thus, the Justice Rides ride together into the sunset one last time. Meanwhile, back at the ruins of Paradise, Faust rises from the death once more, revealing himself to truly be a supernatural being.

It opened in 1976 at 1888 Green Oaks Road and Interstate 30. It is owned by GK Development, Inc., includes three anchor stores: Dillard's Clearance Center, JCPenney, and Rave Cinemas with three vacant anchors last occupied by Macy's (formally Foley's), Sears, and Neiman Marcus. It is recognized as the main shopping destination in Fort Worth, also serving other rural areas within proximity to Fort Worth.  History  Food Court Entrance Ridgmar Mall opened in 1976 with Dillard's, JCPenney, Neiman Marcus, and Sears as the original anchors. Foley's was added in 1998 and was converted to Macy's in 2006. Rave Cinemas opened in the 2000s. In 2013, GK Development acquired the property, with plans to redevelop the property into a mixed use development. In 2016, a 20,693 square foot H&M; store would be dedicated; it would open as the city's first. On January 6, 2016, it was announced that Macy's would be closing in early Spring 2016 in a corporate effort to cut operating costs. In March 2016, Dillard's was converted to a clearance center.232x232px In October 2016, the 120,000 square foot Neiman Marcus space was acquired by GK Development; with plans for its redevelopment being announced online. In early 2017, a three phase renovation commenced, which would involve adding a new coat of paint, new light fixtures, new railings and a $3,000,000 renovation of its Rave Cinemas. On January 28, 2017, Neiman Marcus relocated to a smaller location in The Shops At Clearfork. By the end of 2017, a 27,000 square foot SeaQuest aquarium opened to visitors. Although the mall faces three vacant anchor tenant spaces, Athletic Apex has acquired a portion of the vacant Neiman Marcus space and has planned to open a 60,000 square foot location at some point in the future. On May 31, 2018, it was announced that Sears would also be closing as part of a plan to close 72 stores nationwide. The store closed in September 2018.

It also refers to the use of the products of nanotechnology to enhance sustainability. It includes making green nano-products and using nano-products in support of sustainability. Green nanotechnology has been described as the development of clean technologies, \\"to minimize potential environmental and human health risks associated with the manufacture and use of nanotechnology products, and to encourage replacement of existing products with new nano- products that are more environmentally friendly throughout their lifecycle.\\"  Aim  Green nanotechnology has two goals: producing nanomaterials and products without harming the environment or human health, and producing nano- products that provide solutions to environmental problems. It uses existing principles of green chemistry and green engineeringWhat is Green Engineering, US Environmental Protection Agency to make nanomaterials and nano-products without toxic ingredients, at low temperatures using less energy and renewable inputs wherever possible, and using lifecycle thinking in all design and engineering stages. In addition to making nanomaterials and products with less impact to the environment, green nanotechnology also means using nanotechnology to make current manufacturing processes for non-nano materials and products more environmentally friendly. For example, nanoscale membranes can help separate desired chemical reaction products from waste materials from plants. Nanoscale catalysts can make chemical reactions more efficient and less wasteful. Sensors at the nanoscale can form a part of process control systems, working with nano-enabled information systems. Using alternative energy systems, made possible by nanotechnology, is another way to \\"green\\" manufacturing processes. The second goal of green nanotechnology involves developing products that benefit the environment either directly or indirectly. Nanomaterials or products directly can clean hazardous waste sites, desalinate water, treat pollutants, or sense and monitor environmental pollutants. Indirectly, lightweight nanocomposites for automobiles and other means of transportation could save fuel and reduce materials used for production; nanotechnology-enabled fuel cells and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) could reduce pollution from energy generation and help conserve fossil fuels; self-cleaning nanoscale surface coatings could reduce or eliminate many cleaning chemicals used in regular maintenance routines; and enhanced battery life could lead to less material use and less waste. Green Nanotechnology takes a broad systems view of nanomaterials and products, ensuring that unforeseen consequences are minimized and that impacts are anticipated throughout the full life cycle.Nanotechnology and Life Cycle Assessment  Current research  = Solar cells = Research is underway to use nanomaterials for purposes including more efficient solar cells, practical fuel cells, and environmentally friendly batteries. The most advanced nanotechnology projects related to energy are: storage, conversion, manufacturing improvements by reducing materials and process rates, energy saving (by better thermal insulation for example), and enhanced renewable energy sources. One major project that is being worked on is the development of nanotechnology in solar cells. Solar cells are more efficient as they get tinier and solar energy is a renewable resource. The price per watt of solar energy is lower than one dollar. Research is ongoing to use nanowires and other nanostructured materials with the hope of to create cheaper and more efficient solar cells than are possible with conventional planar silicon solar cells. Another example is the use of fuel cells powered by hydrogen, potentially using a catalyst consisting of carbon supported noble metal particles with diameters of 1‚Äì5 nm. Materials with small nanosized pores may be suitable for hydrogen storage. Nanotechnology may also find applications in batteries, where the use of nanomaterials may enable batteries with higher energy content or supercapacitors with a higher rate of recharging. Nanotechnology is already used to provide improved performance coatings for photovoltaic (PV) and solar thermal panels. Hydrophobic and self-cleaning properties combine to create more efficient solar panels, especially during inclement weather. PV covered with nanotechnology coatings are said to stay cleaner for longer to ensure maximum energy efficiency is maintained. = Nanoremediation and water treatment = Nanotechnology offers the potential of novel nanomaterials for the treatment of surface water, groundwater, wastewater, and other environmental materials contaminated by toxic metal ions, organic and inorganic solutes, and microorganisms. Due to their unique activity toward recalcitrant contaminants, many nanomaterials are under active research and development for use in the treatment of water and contaminated sites. The present market of nanotech-based technologies applied in water treatment consists of reverse osmosis(RO), nanofiltration, ultrafiltration membranes. Indeed, among emerging products one can name nanofiber filters, carbon nanotubes and various nanoparticles. Nanotechnology is expected to deal more efficiently with contaminants which convectional water treatment systems struggle to treat, including bacteria, viruses and heavy metals. This efficiency generally stems from the very high specific surface area of nanomaterials which increases dissolution, reactivity and sorption of contaminants.  Environmental remediation  Nanoremediation is the use of nanoparticles for environmental remediation. Nanoremediation has been most widely used for groundwater treatment, with additional extensive research in wastewater treatment. Nanoremediation has also been tested for soil and sediment cleanup. Even more preliminary research is exploring the use of nanoparticles to remove toxic materials from gases. Some nanoremediation methods, particularly the use of nano zerovalent iron for groundwater cleanup, have been deployed at full-scale cleanup sites. Nanoremediation is an emerging industry; by 2009, nanoremediation technologies had been documented in at least 44 cleanup sites around the world, predominantly in the United States. During nanoremediation, a nanoparticle agent must be brought into contact with the target contaminant under conditions that allow a detoxifying or immobilizing reaction. This process typically involves a pump-and-treat process or in situ application. Other methods remain in research phases. Scientists have been researching the capabilities of buckminsterfullerene in controlling pollution, as it may be able to control certain chemical reactions. Buckminsterfullerene has been demonstrated as having the ability of inducing the protection of reactive oxygen species and causing lipid peroxidation. This material may allow for hydrogen fuel to be more accessible to consumers.  Water cleaning technology  In 2017 the RingwooditE Co Ltd was formed in order to explore Thermonuclear Trap Technology (TTT) for the purpose of cleaning all sources of water from pollution and toxic contents. This patented nanotechnology uses a high pressure and temperature chamber to separate isotopes that should by nature not be in drinking water to pure drinking water, as to the by the WHO¬¥s established classification. This method has been developed by among others, by professor Vladimir Afanasiew, at the Moscow Nuclear Institution. This technology is targeted to clean Sea, river, lake and landfill waste waters. It even removes radioactive isotopes from the sea water, after Nuclear Power Stations catastrophes and cooling water plant towers. By this technology pharmaca rests are being removed as well as narcotics and tranquilizers. Bottom layers and sides at lake and rivers can be returned, after being cleaned. Machinery used for this purpose are much similar to those of deep sea mining. Removed waste items are being sorted by the process, and can be re used as raw material for other industrial production.  Water filtration  Nanofiltration is a relatively recent membrane filtration process used most often with low total dissolved solids water such as surface water and fresh groundwater, with the purpose of softening (polyvalent cation removal) and removal of disinfection by-product precursors such as natural organic matter and synthetic organic matter.Raymond D. Letterman (ed.)(1999). \\"Water Quality and Treatment.\\" 5th Ed. (New York: American Water Works Association and McGraw-Hill.) .Dow Chemical Co. Nanofiltration Membranes and Applications Nanofiltration is also becoming more widely used in food processing applications such as dairy, for simultaneous concentration and partial (monovalent ion) demineralisation. Nanofiltration is a membrane filtration based method that uses nanometer sized cylindrical through-pores that pass through the membrane at a 90¬∞. Nanofiltration membranes have pore sizes from 1-10 Angstrom, smaller than that used in microfiltration and ultrafiltration, but just larger than that in reverse osmosis. Membranes used are predominantly created from polymer thin films. Materials that are commonly used include polyethylene terephthalate or metals such as aluminum. Pore dimensions are controlled by pH, temperature and time during development with pore densities ranging from 1 to 106 pores per cm2. Membranes made from polyethylene terephthalate and other similar materials, are referred to as \\"track-etch\\" membranes, named after the way the pores on the membranes are made. \\"Tracking\\" involves bombarding the polymer thin film with high energy particles. This results in making tracks that are chemically developed into the membrane, or \\"etched\\" into the membrane, which are the pores. Membranes created from metal such as alumina membranes, are made by electrochemically growing a thin layer of aluminum oxide from aluminum metal in an acidic medium. Some water-treatment devices incorporating nanotechnology are already on the market, with more in development. Low-cost nanostructured separation membranes methods have been shown to be effective in producing potable water in a recent study.  Nanotech to disinfect water  Nanotechnology provides an alternative solution to clean germs in water, a problem that has been getting worse due to the population explosion, growing need for clean water and the emergence of additional pollutants. One of the alternatives offered is antimicrobial nanotechnology stated that several nanomaterials showed strong antimicrobial properties through diverse mechanisms, such as photocatalytic production of reactive oxygen species that damage cell components and viruses. There is also the case of the synthetically-fabricated nanometallic particles that produce antimicrobial action called oligodynamic disinfection, which can inactivate microorganisms at low concentrations. Commercial purification systems based on titanium oxide photocatalysis also currently exist and studies show that this technology can achieve complete inactivation of fecal coliforms in 15 minutes once activated by sunlight. There are four classes of nanomaterials that are employed for water treatment and these are dendrimers, zeolites, carbonaceous nanomaterials, and metals containing nanoparticles. The benefits of the reduction of the size of the metals (e.g. silver, copper, titanium, and cobalt) to the nanoscale such as contact efficiency, greater surface area, and better elution properties.  Cleaning up oil spills  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) documents more than ten thousand oil spills per year. Conventionally, biological, dispersing, and gelling agents are deployed to remedy oil spills. Although, these methods have been used for decades, none of these techniques can retrieve the irreplaceable lost oil. However, nanowires can not only swiftly clean up oil spills but also recover as much oil as possible. These nanowires form a mesh that absorbs up to twenty times its weight in hydrophobic liquids while rejecting water with its water repelling coating. Since the potassium manganese oxide is very stable even at high temperatures, the oil can be boiled off the nanowires and both the oil and the nanowires can then be reused. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina damaged or destroyed more than thirty oil platforms and nine refineries. The Interface Science Corporation successfully launched a new oil remediation and recovery application, which used the water repelling nanowires to clean up the oil spilled by the damaged oil platforms and refineries. = Removing plastics from oceans = One innovation of green nanotechnology that is currently under development are nanomachines modeled after a bacteria bioengineered to consume plastics, Ideonella sakaiensis. These nano-machines are able to decompose plastics dozens of times faster than the bioengineered bacteria not only because of their increased surface area but also because of the fact that the energy released from decomposing the plastic is used to fuel the nano- machines. = Air pollution control = In addition to water treatment and environmental remediation, nanotechnology is currently improving air quality. Nanoparticles can be engineered to catalyze, or hasten, the reaction to transform environmentally pernicious gases into harmless ones. For example, many industrial factories that produce large amounts harmful gases employ a type of nanofiber catalyst made of magnesium oxide (Mg2O) to purify dangerous organic substances in the smoke. Although chemical catalysts already exist in the gaseous vapors from cars, nanotechnology has a greater chance of reacting with the harmful substances in the vapors. This greater probability comes from the fact that nanotechnology can interact with more particles because of its greater surface area. Nanotechnology has been used to remediate air pollution including car exhaust pollution, and potentially greenhouse gases due to its high surface area. Based on research done by the Environmental Science Pollution Research International, nanotechnology can specifically help to treat carbon-based nanoparticles, greenhouse gases, and volatile organic compounds. There is also work being done to develop antibacterial nanoparticles, metal oxide nanoparticles, and amendment agents for phytoremediation processes. Nanotechnology can also give the possibility of preventing air pollution in the first place due to its extremely small scale. Nanotechnology has been accepted as a tool for many industrial and domestic fields like gas monitoring systems, fire and toxic gas detectors, ventilation control, breath alcohol detectors and many more. Other sources state that nanotechnology has the potential to develop the pollutants sensing and detection methods that already exist. The ability to detect pollutants and sense unwanted materials will be heightened by the large surface area of nanomaterials and their high surface energy. The World Health Organization declared in 2014 that air contamination caused around 7 million deaths in 2012. This new technology could be an essential asset to this epidemic. The three ways that nanotechnology is being used to treat air pollution are nano- adsorptive materials, degradation by nanocatalysis, and filtration/separation by nanofilters. Nanoscale adsorbents being the main alleviator for many air pollution difficulties. Their structure permits a great interaction with organic compounds as well as increased selectivity and stability in maximum adsorption capacity. Other advantages include high electrical and thermal conductivities, high strength, high hardness. Target pollutants that can be targeted by nanomolecules are „ÄñNO„Äó_x, „ÄñCO„Äó_2, „ÄñNH„Äó_3, N_2, VOCs, Isopropyl vapor, „ÄñCH„Äó_3 OH gases, N_2 O, H_2 S. Carbon nanotubes specifically remove particles in many ways. One method is by passing them through the nanotubes where the molecules are oxidized; the molecules then are adsorbed on a nitrate species. Carbon nanotubes with amine groups provide numerous chemical sites for carbon dioxide adsorption at low temperature ranges of 20¬∞-100¬∞ degrees Celsius. Van der waals forces and œÄ-œÄ interactions also are used to pull molecules onto surface functional groups. Fullerene can be used to rid of carbon dioxide pollution due to its high adsorption capacity. Graphene nanotubes have functional groups that adsorb gases. There are plenty of nanocatalysts that can be used for air pollution reduction and air quality. Some of these materials include „ÄñTiO„Äó_2, Vanadium, Platinum, Palladium, Rhodium, and Silver. Catalytic industrial emission reduction, car exhaust reduction, and air purification are just some of the major thrusts that these nanomaterials are being utilized within. Certain applications are not widely spread, but other are more popular. Indoor air pollution is barely on the market yet, but it is being developed more efficiently due to complications with health effects. Car exhaust emission reduction is widely used in diesel fueled automobiles currently being one of the more popular applications. Industrial emission reduction is also widely used. It is n integral method specifically at coal fired power plants as well as refineries. These methods are analyzed and reviewed using SEM imaging to ensure its usefulness and accuracy. Additionally, research is currently being conducted to find out if nanoparticles can be engineered to separate car exhaust from methane or carbon dioxide, which has been known to damage the Earth's ozone layer. In fact, John Zhu, a professor at the University of Queensland, is exploring the creation of a carbon nanotube(CNT) which can trap greenhouse gases hundreds of times more efficiently than current methods can.  Nanotechnology for sensors  Perpetual exposure to heavy metal pollution and particulate matter will lead to health concerns such as lung cancer, heart conditions, and even motor neuron diseases. However, humanity's ability to shield themselves from these health problems can be improved by accurate and swift nanocontact-sensors able to detect pollutants at the atomic level. These nanocontact sensors do not require much energy to detect metal ions or radioactive elements. Additionally, they can be made in automatic mode so that they can be readably used at any given moment. Additionally, these nanocontact sensors are energy and cost effective since they are composed with conventional microelectronic manufacturing equipment using electrochemical techniques. Some examples of nano-based monitoring include: # Functionalized nanoparticles able to form anionic oxidants bonding thereby allowing the detection of carcinogenic substances at very low concentrations. # Polymer nanospheres have been developed to measure organic contaminates in very low concentrations # \\"Peptide nanoelectrodes have been employed based on the concept of thermocouple. In a 'nano-distance separation gap, a peptide molecule is placed to form a molecular junction. When a specific metal ion is bound to the gap; the electrical current will result conductance in a unique value. Hence the metal ion will be easily detected.\\" # Composite electrodes, a mixture of nanotubes and copper, have been created to detect substances such as organophosphorus pesticides, carbohydrates and other woods pathogenic substances in low concentrations.  Concerns  Although green nanotechnology poses many advantages over traditional methods, there is still much debate about the concerns brought about by nanotechnology. For example, since the nanoparticles are small enough to be absorbed into skin and/or inhaled, countries are mandating that additional research revolving around the impact of nanotechnology on organisms be heavily studied. In fact, the field of eco- nanotoxicology was founded solely to study the effect of nanotechnology on earth and all of its organisms. At the moment, scientists are unsure of what will happen when nanoparticles seep into soil and water, but organizations, such as NanoImpactNet, have set out to study these effects.

In the mid-1980s Kelly and a group of like-minded musicians started calling themselves \\"anti-folk\\" and started a small but intense movement.Robbins, Tom, \\"Citystate: Labor's Punk Songman\\", The Village Voice, 49:10, March 10‚Äì16, 2004, p.22 Kelly's music has been infrequently recorded over the years.Henderson, Alex, [ \\"Kirk Kelly Biography\\"], AllMusic His work has often included topical songs. Some of Kelly's early songs dealt with the labor movement and were based upon his own work experience. A decade or so after starting his musical career Kelly was accepted to and attended an AFL-CIO organizer's training school and began working throughout the United States as a union organizer. Biography Kelly was born on Long Island circa 1960 and grew up listening to (among other things) Irish musicians such as the Clancy Brothers. In the early 1980s he began performing music that was influenced by both the folk revival artists and punk bands such as the Ramones and the Clash. In the mid-80s Kelly found that the old guard of the Greenwich Village folk scene were unwilling accept this combination as legitimate folk music. One night Kelly was banned from the open mics at Gerde's Folk City for handing out flyers for a performance at an East Village venue. As a result, Kelly banded together with like-minded musicians, Lach, Cindy Lee Berryhill, and Roger Manning to form the roots of what became known as the \\"anti-folk movement.\\" Kelly's first recording was in a duo with Lach (regarded by many as the father of anti-folk) as \\"The Folk Brothers\\" in 1985 on their cassette-only release called, All Folked up with Nowhere to Go. Kelly's first solo release, Go Man Go, appeared in 1988 on the punk label, SST (Black Flag, etc.). Allmusic calls the title song \\"hard driving and great, typical of Kelly.\\"Meyer, Richard, [ \\"Review: Go Man Go\\"], AllMusic In the same year that \\"Just Do It!\\" first appeared in commercials for Nike, Inc., \\"Go Man Go\\" seemed to be something of a slogan among anti-folk scenesters. The phrase is quoted in a couple of songs on Roger Manning's debut release in that same year. Nearly the entire album features Kelly performing solo with guitar and harmonica (producer Brian Ritchie plays acoustic bass guitar on one song). Kelly's sound clearly shows the influence of early Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs. The later is paid a tribute on \\"Heroes of Tomorrow\\" (both a call to action and a look at figures of the past including Joe Hill, Eugene Debs, and Ochs). One reviewer of Kelly's first album called the work \\"so derivative of Bob Dylan that maybe A.J. Weberman should consider rooting through Kelly's trash.Robbins, Ira, Review: Go Man Go, TrouserPress.com (original source ?) A number of Kelly's earliest songs dealt with labor issues (e.g. \\"Corporation Plow\\"). Kelly's own experience working as a fruit picker on Long Island's East End planted the seed for his song, \\"Working in the Vineyards\\". Over time Kelly began performing at union rallies and would get called to play at picket lines. Later, while working in an airline's reservation office Kelly worked as a \\"white collar member\\" of the machinist's union. After several years on the job Kelly applied to an organizer's training school with the AFL-CIO. Soon he was helping to organize campaigns all around the United States, such as a Teamsters local on the waterfront in Seattle, Washington. Kelly's socio- political second album, New City (1997) was released nearly a decade after his first.Hendrson, Alex, [ \\"Review: New City ‚Äì Kirk Kelly\\"], AllMusic Kelly put it out on his own, Mugsy Records, a label that grew to include a handful of artists in the early 2000s. The \\"Mugsy Records Manifesto\\" laid out the labels mission to \\"fight for social and economic justice\\" saying: > \\"America belongs to those who build it, fix it, run it, clean it, protect > it, feed it, care for it and educate it. In the work we do we forge a common > identity and it is the work of its most progressive artists to give voice to > that identity. America's popular culture must tell the real story of its > people and reflect its true identity.\\"Mugsy Records Manifesto via. the > Internet Archive of mugsyrecords.com In 2003 Kelly's cover of \\"Downbound Train\\" was chosen for the Springsteen tribute album, Light of Day. Allmusic called his arrangement \\"radical\\" as Kelly stripped the song down to simply vocals and ukulele. Although a 2004 interview quotes Kelly discussing songs to appear on his \\"next album\\" (including a song about patriot Nathan Hale) as of 2008 no recording appears to have materialized. Kelly continues, however, to make appearances where he both sings and speaks out for workers rights.Kelly, Kirk, \\"Music and May Day\\" , Allegro (publication of Local 802, American Federation of Musicians), May 8, 2007 Discography =Solo albums= * Go Man Go (1988, SST) * New City (1997, Mugsy Records) =See also= * All Folked up with Nowhere to Go (1985) ‚Äì cassette only release by Kirk Kelly and Lach as \\"The Folk Brothers\\" * The Political Song (May 1983, CooP/Fast Folk Musical Magazine) ‚Äì compilation included \\"Nineteen Miles from Shoreham Town\\"CooP ‚Äì Fast Folk Musical Magazine (Vol. 2, No. 4) * Quixotic (1984, Fast Folk Musical Magazine) ‚Äì compilation included \\"I Pity the Poor British Soldier\\"Fast Folk Musical Magazine (Vol. 1, No. 7) * Cross Country (1988, Fast Folk Musical Magazine) ‚Äì compilation included \\"Dead Aid\\"Fast Folk Musical Magazine (Vol. 4, No. 7) * Broome Closet Anti Folk Sessions (1989) ‚Äì compilation that featured Kelly, Roger Manning, Billy Syndrome, Paleface, Susie Unger, John S.

The aerodrome was utilised for a period of time, after World War II, as a storage facility (bomb dump) for United States Army Air Forces and 10,000 500lb general purpose aerial bombs were placed upon the landing strip. The runway ran down the center of the current Whalan Reserve in a roughly North-South (NNW-SSE) direction. After the war the fledgling Australian Racing Drivers Club ran races there (1951-53) at the Mt Druitt race track which incorporated part of the runway and taxi ways. The land was not handed back to its owner until January 1951. Only a part of the land was handed back to the owner which is why the racing ended in 1956 when the club was preparing to bid for the fledgling F1 championship race to be held in Australia. Argument over land ownership and the right to hold the F1 race meeting ended when the owner of part of the track dug huge tranches in the track, 2 metres deep, this ended the life of this race track.

The various species lived from 501 to 490 million years ago during the Dresbachian faunal stage of the late Cambrian Period. Fossils of Meteoraspis are characteristic of Late Cambrian strata in North America, though they are found in Late Cambrian strata elsewhere in the world, such as M. nevensis from Victoria Land, Antarctica.  Description  The outline of the exoskeleton of Meteoraspis is an elongate, slightly inverted egg shaped though almost ovate, widest at the tip of the genal spines and 1.6√ó as long as wide. The headshield (or cephalon) is highly vaulted. The well-defined central raised area (or glabella) is convex, elongate tapering, with a rounded front, and has only one furrow, crossing it near the back of the cephalon, defining the occipital ring. A node may be present on the occipital ring. The remaining parts of the cephalon, called fixed and free cheeks (or fixigenae and librigenae) are upsloping. The fracture lines (or sutures) that in moulting separate the librigenae from the fixigenae are divergent just in front of the eyes, becoming parallel near the border furrow and slightly convergent at the margin. From the back of the eyes the sutures follow a lazy S-curve, diverging first more outward and near the margin more backward, cutting the posterior margin within the inner bend of the spine (or opisthoparian sutures). Uniquely, the furrow parallel to the margin (or border furrow) has 2 not very noticeable pits in front of the glabella, and rarely a very faint 3rd median pit. There are no ridges that connect the eye to the glabella. The medium- sized eyes (over ‚Öì√ó the length of the glabella) are slightly behind the middle of the glabella. Genal angle ending in short spines extending backward about one thorax segment. The articulating middle part of the body (or thorax) has 13 segments. The axis is convex, and less than ¬Ω√ó as wide as each of the so- called pleurae to its sides. Segments pointed sideways with a rounded front (a shape called falcate). The tailshield (or pygidium) is about ¬Ω√ó as wide as the cephalon, almost twice as wide as long, excluding the two flat, shark tooth shaped, widely spaced spines. The axis in the pygidium is 1¬º√ó longer than wide, with almost parallel sides, almost reaching the rear margin, with 3 or 4 axial rings; 3 sets of interpleural grooves and pleural furrows ending at distance of the margin. There is no furrow that would define a border in the pygidium. = Comparison with Tricrepicephalus = Species of the related genus Tricrepicephalus can be differentiated from those of Meteoraspis by having three equally prominent pits in the anterior border furrow, a much less vaulted cephalon, with spines reaching at least to the third thorax segment, 12 thorax segments and two long, tubular, curved pygidial spines that are reminiscent of the pincers of an earwig.  Reassigned species  Philippe Janvier assigned Cephalaspis gigas, an Early Devonian osteostracan agnathan with a tremendously wide headshield, to the newly erected genus Meteoraspis in 1981. This name however, was already used by Resser in 1935 for a trilobite. In 1987 the osteostracan genus was renamed to Parameteoraspis. * M. caroli = Parameteoraspis caroli * M. gigas = Parameteoraspis gigas * M. lanternaria = Parameteoraspis laternaria * M. lata = Parameteoraspis lata * M. laticornis = Parameteoraspis laticornis * M. menoides = Parameteoraspis menoides * M. oberon = Parameteoraspis oberon * M. oblonga = Parameteoraspis oblonga  Distribution  * M. etheridgei is known from the Cambrian of Australia (late Mindyallan, Dolodrook River Limestone Formation, Garvey Gully, Dolodrook River, East Victoria, 37.6¬∞ S, 146.6¬∞ E). cited in * M. metra has been excavated from the Upper Cambrian of the United States (Dresbachian, Coosella zone, Riley Formation, Central Texas, 30.3¬∞ N, 97.7¬∞ W; cited in and Crepicephalus trilobite zone, lower Member of the Deadwood Formation, Little Elk Creek County, South Dakota, 44.3¬∞ N, 103.6¬∞ W cited in ).

The earliest military presence in the area was former Camp Goodwin, constructed in 1864 and named for Arizona's first territorial governor, John N. Goodwin. The camp was abandoned after a short time due to failed buildings and malaria from a nearby spring. In 1876, the current site of the community was chosen as a \\"new post on the Gila,\\" selected to replace Camp Goodwin during the Apache Wars. Initially, the site was named Camp Thomas in honor of Civil War Major General George Henry Thomas. Until 1882 the area would be known by several names including Clantonville, Camp Thomas, Maxey and finally Fort Thomas. At its peak, the fort consisted of 27 buildings, all constructed by the occupants of the fort and made of adobe. Malaria remained a problem throughout the occupation of the area, and led to Fort Thomas being called the \\"worst fort in the Army.\\"https://science- train.com/w/Fort_Thomas,_Arizona/History.html The fort also had no government funding until the year 1884. After the capture of Geronimo in 1886, the Army gradually removed the troops stationed there until the fort was handed over to the Department of the Interior in 1891. The early town had a poor reputation, and was home to several houses of prostitution and saloons. Camp Thomas was to be the destination of the pay wagons involved in the Wham Paymaster robbery of 1889. In 1895, the community grew significantly when the Southern Pacific railroad's construction in the area was halted due to native Apache people refusing to let the railroad continue construction through their reservation. During this time, Fort Thomas also hosted a Wells Fargo station.Official history from Fortthomas.org, retrieved 21 November 2008 Education Ruins of the Southern Pacific Railroad Depot Fort Thomas has its own unified school district, the Fort Thomas Unified School District that serves the community of Fort Thomas, as well as students from nearby Bylas.

Researcher Bizaa Zeynab Ali describes them as lacking a significant popular base of support but \\"sustained by free-flowing Saudi money, assisted by a mainstream political party (Pakistan Muslim League (N)) and protected by Pakistani intelligence services\\" (the Inter-Services Intelligence). Originally a religious group, it was launched as a political party in 1986 by leader Ehsan Elahi Zaheer, with generous Saudi funding and support, to spread its 'revivalist program' from 'mosques and madrassas' to the public sphere. According to Olivier Roy, JAH opposed government involvement in affairs of sharia law -- unlike similar Islamic groups. However an interview with its leader, Sajid Mir, posted on its website circa 2010 states that it seeks to address what Mir calls the \\"deliberate and organized efforts at the state level to replace honorable Muslim values in society with the offensive Western culture\\". JAH is also strongly sectarian and aggressively antagonistic to those Muslims it believes are not true Muslims, such as Shia, and especially the Ahmadi, preaching on their website that \\"the religious duty of every Muslim\\" is \\"to dispatch an Ahmedis to hell\\". Even Sunni revivalist Deobandis have been attacked by the JAH as mushrikin (polytheists) \\"for their veneration of the Prophet\\", according to B.Z. Ali. Zaheer was assassinated in 1987, probably by a Shia. As of 2014 the party is led by Professor Sajid Mir. The party was part of the Islamic fundamentalist Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, alliance that won 11.3 percent of the popular vote in the 2002 legislative elections, but has since folded.

History =Background= The Jaina Bhagavati-Sutra of the 5th century AD mentions that Purulia was one of the sixteen mahajanapadas and was a part of the kingdom known as Vajra-bhumi in ancient times. In 1833, the Manbhum district was carved out of the Jungle Mahals district, with headquarters at Manbazar. In 1838, the headquarters was transferred to Purulia. After independence, when Manbhum district was a part of Bihar, efforts were made to impose Hindi on the Bengali-speaking majority of the district and it led to the Bengali Language Movement (Manbhum). In 1956, the Manbhum district was partitioned between Bihar and West Bengal under the States Reorganization Act and the Bihar and West Bengal (Transfer of Territories) Act 1956. =Red corridor= 106 districts spanning 10 states across India, described as being part of the left wing extremism activities, constitutes the Red corridor. In West Bengal the districts of Paschim Medinipur, Bankura, Purulia and Birbhum are part of the Red corridor.

Certain reports also included the Manbazar I and Joypur CD blocks and some times indicted the whole of the Purulia district. The Lalgarh movement, which started attracting attention after the failed assassination attempt on Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, then chief minister of West Bengal, in the Salboni area of the Paschim Medinipur district, on 2 November 2008 and the police action that followed, had also spread over to these areas. The movement was not just a political struggle but an armed struggle that concurrently took the look of a social struggle. A large number of CPI (M) activists were killed. Although the epi-centre of the movement was Lalgarh, it was spread across 19 police stations in three adjoining districts ‚Äì Paschim Medinipur, Bankura and Purulia, all thickly forested and near the border with Jharkhand. The deployment of the CRPF and other forces started on 11 June 2009. The movement came to an end after the 2011 state assembly elections and change of government in West Bengal.

He was particularly associated with the French and Italian repertories. His huge repertoire included an estimated 240 roles and he won renown as one of the most memorable singing-actors of the 20th century.  Life and career  Vanni Marcoux as Guido Colonna in Henry F√©vrier‚Äôs Monna Vanna Jean-√âmile Diog√®ne Marcoux was born to a French father and an Italian mother in Turin, Italy. His mother gave him the nickname \\"Vanni\\", short for Giovanni, the Italian equivalent of Jean. After completing law studies, he decided to devote himself to music. He studied with Collini at the music conservatory in his hometown. He made his operatic debut in 1894, at the age of 17, as Sparafucile in Verdi's Rigoletto, in Turin. After further studies in Paris with Fr√©d√©ric Boyer, he made his first stage appearance in France, at Bayonne, as Fr√®re Laurent in Gounod's Rom√©o et Juliette, in 1899. Thereafter he toured a number of provincial theatres, which led to his debut at the Royal Opera House in London, as Basilio in Rossini's The Barber of Seville, in 1905, and at La Monnaie in Brussels, as Bertram in Meyerbeer's Robert le diable, in 1906. Vanni Marcoux made his Paris Op√©ra debut in 1908 as M√©phisto in Gounod's Faust, and at La Scala in 1910, as the Old Hebrew in Saint-Sa√´ns' Samson and Delilah. The same year, 1910, he sang for the first time Massenet's Don Quichotte at the \\"Gaiet√© Lyrique\\"\\" in Paris, a part that would soon become his signature role. For nearly 40 years, Vanni Marcoux was a familiar and much admired figure in Parisian musical life, mainly at the Op√©ra and the Op√©ra-Comique, where he created a number of roles in contemporary operas such as Raoul Gunsbourg's Lysistrata, Max d'Ollone's L'Arlequin, Henry F√©vrier's Monna Vanna and La Femme nue, Massenet's Panurge, and Honegger's and Ibert's L'Aiglon. Word of his many successes crossed the Atlantic, and he was invited to join the Boston Opera Company, where he made his debut in 1912 as Golaud in Debussy's Pell√©as et M√©lisande. This was followed by his debut at the Chicago Grand Opera Company in 1913, as the four villains in Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann, which is considered one of his greatest histrionic achievements. His success in America was partly due to the soprano Mary Garden, who had popularized French opera in Chicago, thus laying the groundwork for his visit. In October 1914, in the early stages of World War I, it was erroneously reported in the press that he had been killed on active service as a member of the French Army. In 1919, Vanni Marcoux appeared at the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires, the most important opera house in South America. Among his more notable interpretations were Philippe II in Don Carlos, Rafaele in The Jewels of the Madonna, Iago in Otello, and the title character in Gianni Schicchi. Vanni Marcoux began teaching at the Paris Conservatory in 1938. He retired from the stage in 1948 and became director of the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Bordeaux. He held that post from 1948 to 1951. His death occurred in 1962. Vanni Marcoux's career was impressive for its longevity and the remarkably wide variety of operatic roles which it embraced. He possessed a clear, although not especially large voice, with a characteristic vibrato and a weight and timbre of almost tenor quality (see Scott, Record of Singing 1979). His French diction was praised for its clarity, and he was also acclaimed by music critics for the quality of his musicianship and his outstanding dramatic intelligence. Personal life He married Madeleine Morlay, an actress, in 1914. His wife was portraited by Antonio de La Gandara and one of the two works painted is exhibited in the Beauvais Museum (France) and on display on the website dedicated to La Gandara.http://www.lagandara.fr  See also  * Le Miracle des loups (1924 film) * L'Aiglon References  Sources  * D.

It consists of little more than a one gas station, a trailer park, a closed diner and a California agricultural inspection station. In November 1973, an area near Vidal Junction and the Colorado River Aqueduct was selected as the preferred site of the Eastern Desert nuclear facility for Southern California Edison. Though not a destination in its own right, Vidal Junction is a frequently used rest area and jumping-off point for travelers headed to Colorado River resort towns such as Lake Havasu and Laughlin, Nevada. The ZIP Code is 92280 and the community is inside area code 760.

The documents, which include transcriptions and annotations, have been published both online and in printed form. The project is sponsored by the Church History Department of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), while the website and volumes are published under the department's imprint, the Church Historian's Press. History of the project After Joseph Smith's death in 1844, a collection of his papers was carried West by Brigham Young and other church leaders. Some significant documents remained with John Whitmer, Smith's widow Emma, and others. Many of these were not published until years later by the LDS Church, the Community of Christ, and independent researchers. The \\"Roots of the current effort\\" began in the late 1960s when Truman G. Madsen invited Dean C. Jessee, then an employee of the Church Historian's Office, to contribute documents relating to Joseph Smith and early Mormonism to issues of BYU Studies. In 1972 Leonard J. Arrington was appointed the Church Historian and he directed Jessee to continue to \\"locate, collect, and transcribe Smith's writings.\\" This resulted in Jessee's 1984 publication, The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith followed by the two volume Papers of Joseph Smith, the first in 1989 and the second in 1992. In 2001, Dean Jessee's project became a joint venture between Brigham Young University's Joseph Fielding Smith Institute and the LDS Church Archives. The project was renamed The Joseph Smith Papers and expanded with added funding from Larry H. and Gail Miller. Its preliminary work was important to the creation of the landmark biography, Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling, which Richard Bushman published in 2005. In August 2004, the Project received endorsement by the National Historical Publications and Records Commission, a division of the National Archives, to ensure research is conducted according to the highest scholarly standards. The Project was moved back to the Church History Department in 2005. Although not an official part of the project, a documentary TV series also called The Joseph Smith Papers was created. This series documented the creation of and work involved in the Joseph Smith Papers Project. It was produced by KJZZ-TV in cooperation with the LDS Church History Department. Publishing In February 2008, The Church Historian's Press, an imprint of the Church History Department of the LDS Church, was established \\"for publishing works related to the Church's origin and growth.\\" The publication of The Joseph Smith Papers is the press's initial project. Marlin K. Jensen, Church Historian and Recorder at the time of the announcement, said the project will include \\"journals, diaries, correspondence, articles and notices. Everything of a written nature Joseph Smith generated, or over which he had oversight.\\" High resolution images of many of the original documents were published by Brigham Young University Press in 2002 as part of Selected Collections from the Archives of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The two volume set contains 76 DVDs of images from 1830 to 1923, including complete images of the Joseph Smith Collection, circa 1831-1844, the Revelations Collections, circa 1831-1876, architectural drawings of the Nauvoo Temple, and several volumes containing minutes from meetings Joseph Smith attended or oversaw. Annotated transcriptions of the Joseph Smith related document from this DVD collection, in addition to the number of Joseph Smith documents housed in widespread repositories and in private collections will make the documents far more accessible to scholars of American religious history, historians, researchers, and the public. Before publication, transcripts of the manuscripts are verified three times, and annotation is supplied to illuminate the historical context of each document..\\" To assure quality, all citations and footnotes are verified, often double-checked, by production editors and carefully copy edited. The manuscripts are also examined by editors over the project, and drafts of volumes are reviewed by external scholarly reviewers and General Authorities of the LDS Church. The first volume of The Joseph Smith Papers, entitled, The Joseph Smith Papers, Journals, Volume 1: 1832‚Äì1839, was released in December 2008. Despite the $50 retail price, unexpectedly high demand caused the initial printing of 12,500 copies to sell out in two weeks, and the publishers to triple their projected second printing order to 16,500. Many Christmas purchasers bought gift certificates for the coming printing and some extant copies were resold for over twice the retail price. As of October 10, 2009 over 48,000 copies of volume 1 were sold. The second volume of The Joseph Smith Papers, entitled The Joseph Smith Papers: Revelations and Translations, Volume 1: Manuscript Revelation Books was available for purchase September 23, 2009. The original sales projection for this volume was 3,000 copies. Within two weeks, over 6,100 copies were sold in Deseret Book retail stores and over 11,000 copies were requested by other bookstores. Volumes The Joseph Smith Papers project anticipates that it will publish around two dozen print volumes, as well as some additional volumes published online.
