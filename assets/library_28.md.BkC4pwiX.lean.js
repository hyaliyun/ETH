Early career Fukuda started playing baseball in grade 1 of primary school with the Kamoshida Swallows. In junior high, he caught the attention of scouts batting 4th for Midori Chuo Seniors and aiding his team to win the national championship. While playing at Kamoshida Junior High Fukuda's talent was recognized by the New York Mets who invited him to a club tryout. Fukuda entered Yokohama High School based on his hitting abilities and sat on the bench in spring of his freshman year. As a catcher, he would later form a battery with Hideaki Wakui, 2 years his senior and alongside other future pro, Takehiro Ishikawa qualified for the Japanese High School Baseball Championship. While he was a regular, as it was his first year he was often changed out toward the end of games in important situations. From spring of his junior year he was installed at 4th in the batting order. At the 78th Japanese High School Baseball Invitational Tournament he performed duties at clean-up alongside Takuya Takahama and Kenji Sato. He led the team to victory as captain. In summer of the same year, Yokohama High was expected to be title favorites for the 88th Summer Championship but where beaten by a Sho Nakata lead Osaka T≈çin High School 6-11 on the first day of play with Fukuda failing to register a hit. Rated because of his 49 career high school home runs, he was drafted in the 3rd round of the 2006 NPB Draft high school player round by the Chunichi Dragons and on 11 November signed a provisional contract with a ¬•50,000,000 sign-on bonus and a ¬•5,400,000 yearly salary. Professional career 2007-2008 Out of the Dragons draftees taken in 2006, Fukuda's batting was rated the highest and as such he was invited to train with the first team in Spring Camp. He was subsequently invited to an Olympic preparation tournament by then manager Hiromitsu Ochiai. He was expected to be third-string catcher behind Motonobu Tanishige and Kohei Oda but due to the existence of fellow rookie Daisuke Tanaka he finished the farm season making only 9 appearances and failing to register a hit. In order to increase his chance of appearing on the field he was instructed to convert to an infielder and in the off-season started training as a first baseman. In 2008 spring camp, Fukuda became the roommate of Dragons stalwart Masahiro Yamamoto. At the request of manager, Hiromitsu Ochiai he was told to completely convert to first base. However, this did not result in any first- team appearances. Other members of his draft class Naomichi Donoue, Kyohei Iwasaki and Akinobu Shimizu however all saw time in the first team which left Fukuda to be the only member of his class to not have made an appearance in the top team. However, he made more appearances with the farm team batting 4th marking his improvement by hitting a home run off former major leaguer Kazuhisa Ishii in the fall Phoenix League. 2009-2011 In spring camp, Fukuda was once again invited to train with the first team but injured his calf in practice where he was then demoted to the farm team to recover. He was the Western League monthly MVP in June and in July he was brought up to the first team. On 7 July 2009, Fukuda made his debut against the Tokyo Yakult Swallows pinch hitting for Kenichi Nakata at Meiji Jingu Stadium and became the 49th player in NPB history to hit a home-run in his first at-bat. He made his first field appearance as a substitute for an injured Tony Blanco at first base on 31 July however poor hitting as a pinch-hitter thereafter led to his demotion to the farm in August. In 2010 open and practice games, Fukuda was entrusted at 4th in the line-up where he hit .316 with 7 homeruns however his season with the first team would end with only 15 appearances made. After working well in the build-up to the 2011 season, he was on the opening day roster as a right-handed pinch-hitter. He continued as a pinch hitter from opening day and on 13 April, hit his second pro homerun off the pitching of Yokohama DeNA Baystars reliever Shintaro Ejiri. His form would continue and on 15 April he hit his 3rd pro homerun, once again as a pinch hitter, off the pitching of Hanshin Tigers reliever Kyuji Fujikawa. However, in the next 5 plate appearances he would fail to register a hit leading him to being dropped to the farm. He would return to the first team in October where he would make his first Japan Series appearance. 2012-2014 With the trade of catcher Keiji Oyama to the Rakuten Golden Eagles, Fukuda made a return to catching. Efforts were made to give him play time in pre-season matches and he made the opening day roster as third-string catcher. On May 5, Fukuda made his professional catching debut against the Yokohama DeNA Baystars, but in the same game but his first-ever appearance at second base. Once again in the same game, Fukuda would hit his first home run of the season. At the end of the season, Fukuda has played a personal best 49 games but he was unable to shine with the bat, registering a .176 average and one home run. Once again he found himself mostly as a first baseman throughout the season and made the conversion back to the infield in the off-season. In 2013 Fukuda's playing time was limited to 4 appearance in the first team where he averaged .286 in 7 at-bats. On the farm, Fukuda would average just .234, hitting two homeruns in 58 games. The following season once again play time was limited in the first team where he hit .250 in 12 at bats. On the farm however, Fukuda showed an uptick in production hitting .302 with 7 homeruns in 94 games. 2015-2016 From spring training in 2015, Fukuda changed his batting form and hit 4 home runs and a league top 13 RBIs in pre-season fixtures where he made the opening day roster for the first time in 3 years. Due to an injury to opening day first baseman, Masahiko Morino, Fukuda made his first seasons start on March 31 against the Yomiuri Giants where he raked 3 hits, 2 RBIs and a homerun. From April, Fukuda was given more opportunities at first-base. On 21 June, it was announced that the Dragons cheering section had created a personalized song and from 23 June became common use. In the middle of the season, his result as a pinch-hitter declined but he was able to play in a personal best 79 games and hit 6 home runs. During the season pre-match practice, Fukuda was also seen practicing in left field. On 13 November, Fukuda signed an improved contact deal increasing ¬•8,500,000 to ¬•15,000,000. With former Chicago White Sox major leaguer, Dayan Viciedo joining the team as first baseman in 2016, Fukuda found most of his appearances at third base after Shuhei Takahashi's injury in April and then later in left field. With Viciedo's injury toward the end of season, he also saw time at first base and fourth in the order where he ended the season with 10 home runs. 2017-2018 An injury to his right shoulder in the lead-up to opening day, Fukuda joined the team on 23 April. He hit his season first homerun on 7 July against the Yokohama DeNA Baystars and between July and August hit a personal best 14 homeruns, ending the season with 18. For the 2018 season, Fukuda replaced Yudai Ono as player chairman at the beginning of the year and was a regular at third base throughout the season where he passed the stipulate at-bats to be considered for post-season awards. It also marked his first 100 hit season. He hit 14 home runs with a slash line of .261/.322/.405 playing in 133 games. On 24 November, Fukuda signed an improved contract deal increasing ¬•11,000,000 to a total of ¬•47,000,000.

It is the fourteenth film by Perry and the sixth installment in the Madea franchise. It is the fourth Perry film not to be adapted from a play, alongside The Family That Preys, Daddy's Little Girls and Good Deeds, as well as the first Madea film not to be adapted from a play. The film was filmed in Atlanta from mid to late January to the beginning of March 2012 and was released through 34th Street Films and Lionsgate. With total box office gross of about $67 million, Madea's Witness Protection is in the top three of Tyler Perry's most successful movies, after Boo! A Madea Halloween and Madea Goes to Jail. Plot George Needleman, a nerdy, high level CFO in New York City, promises his son that he will take him to his Saturday afternoon baseball game after he gets back from the office. He gets to his office and arrives to a harrowing scene; his co-workers are shredding documents and are in a state of chaos. He sees his boss, Walter, who informs him that his company is a Ponzi scheme run by the mob. He is being accused of spearheading the scheme and laundering funds and has to enter his family into a witness protection program. The program relocates them to a refuge where no one will think to look for them: Madea and Joe's house in Georgia. Meanwhile, Jakewhose elderly, failing father is a church pastor who has put him in charge of the church's mortgage fundstages a robbery (which is unsuccessful). Jake, who has a criminal past but whose father trusts that he has turned over a new leaf, is trying to recover church funds that he has invested in Needleman's company without his father's knowledge or consent, only to lose the entire investment in the Ponzi scheme. The Needlemans' first meeting with Madea and Joe is awkward and bodes poorly for how everyone will get along. However, over time, Madea helps Kate and Cindy relate better to each other and to other family members, while Joe and Kate help George become more confident, more in touch with his surroundings and people around him, and more effective in channeling his emotions. Barbara displays dual sensibilities about \\"colored people\\". On one hand, she mistakes Madea for a domestic named Sadie, treats \\"Sadie\\" imperiously, and threatens to get her fired. On the other hand, she recognizes Joe as a man she slept with years ago (and George's biological father), and relates to him seductively; she also enjoys Negro spirituals and repeatedly asks to be taken to the African American church down the street from Madea's house. Pastor Nelson's sermon inspires George to recognize a pattern in his company's records that explains where 10% of the stolen funds have been stashed. After church, watching Whoopi Goldberg's Oda Mae Brown character in Ghost inspires George to involve Madea in a plan to re-divert funds from the \\"stashed\\" accounts back to the charities whose investments were stolen in the Ponzi scheme. The plan requires George (who disguises himself as a Frenchman to avoid detection by the Malone mob \\"family\\"), Jake, and Madea (who assumes the identity of an upscale woman named Precious Jackson) to travel to New York City, and for \\"Precious\\" to meet with a bank manager to transfer funds from the laundered accounts to the legitimate charities. Madea successfully accomplishes her mission, although she improvises both an expansion of her assumed identity (by pretending to be the oldest Jackson sister) and of the accounts to which \\"Precious's\\" funds are transferred by having some money sent to her real bank account, unbeknownst to George and Jake. When George and Jake begin to share their plan with Brian (Perry), he cuts them off and advises them it's illegal. However, after they pull off the caper, Brian informs George that his cooperation with the authorities and his successful efforts to return the charities' funds have given Brian leverage to dismiss the charges against George. Kate points out to George that the situation has strengthened their relationship and their family, and that it is a blessing in disguise. Upon leaving Madea's house, Cindy and Howie ask if they can come back to visit but both Madea and Joe immediately decline (though Madea does so in a sweet demeanor). Before returning to New York, the Needlemans visit Pastor Nelson's church one last time. The Pastor and Jake burn the mortgage papers and the entire congregation celebrates the mortgage's being paid off, and the Needlemans enjoy the Negro spirituals. Madea also enjoys the spiritual music from her front porch, celebrating her new wealth.

It was collected at the southern end of Medina Range, near the El Cadillal Lake from the R√≠o Loro Formation, dating to the Thanetian or the Selandian stage of the Middle to Late Paleocene, about 61.7 to 55.8 million years ago.Lorosuchus at Fossilworks.org Lorosuchus is characterized by a unique combination of characters, including five autapomorphies such as an elevated narial rim and the presence of a crest on the anteromedial margins of both premaxillae. Phylogenetically, Lorosuchus is currently recognized as the basalmost known sebecid.  Etymology  Lorosuchus was named by Diego Pol and Jaime E.

A cast is housed at the Departamento de Geologia, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro. It was found near Presidente Prudente City of southwest S√£o Paulo State. It was collected from the Adamantina Formation of the Bauru Basin, which dates to the Campanian and Maastrichtian stages of the Late Cretaceous. DGM 1411-R was briefly mentioned before the description of Caryonosuchus. For example, Kellner & Campos (1999) tentatively assigned it to Sphagesaurus sp., however newly described cranial sphagesaurid remains may suggest that the type species of the family, Sphagesaurus huenei, is a nomen dubium. Thus, DGM 1411-R is regarded as a new genus and species. Description Caryonosuchus is characterized by a unique combination of characters, including three autapomorphies (unique characteristics) such as a rostrum with horn-like tubercles on the maxilla and on the premaxilla. Caryonosuchus also has autapomorphic rough ornamentation with grooves and bony ridges on its rostrum.

Description Labidiosuchus is characterized by a unique combination of characters, including four autapomorphies (unique characteristics) such as the presence of small teeth on the medial side of the anterior portion of the dentary. Labidiosuchus had a proportionally large number of the teeth (at least eight on each side of the jaw), packed tightly, some located lateral to each other. The first pair of teeth is procumbent and larger than all others. Its mandible is strongly anterodorsally projected and there is a symphyseal platform that holds the teeth. Due to the incompleteness of the holotype, its feeding preferences or the exact phylogenetic position can't be determined with certainty. DGM 1480-R was briefly described by Campos & Azevedo (1992) as a dinosaur lower jaw. The preserved specimen has a length of about and suggests that the jaw had a Y-shaped outline in dorsal view. This condition of the lower jaw is shared with many ziphosuchians, such as Adamantinasuchus, Sphagesaurus, Notosuchidae and probably with Candidodon. Other characteristics of the dentition which are shared with many members of the Sphagesauridae (such as the strong protruding forward inclination of the first pair of teeth and the presence of anterior projection on the lower jaw) locate it with the Notosuchia, a large group of crocodylomorphs that shows a great variation of dentition. Etymology Labidiosuchus was first named by Alexander W. A. Kellner, Rodrigo G. Figueiredo, Sergio A. K. Azevedo and Diogenes A. Campos in 2011 and the type species is Labidiosuchus amicum. The generic name is derived from Greek labis meaning \\"forceps\\" or \\"tongs\\" and souchus meaning \\"crocodile\\". The specific name comes from the Latin amicus meaning \\"friend\\", in honor of the community that has helped to protect the palaeontological site at Peir√≥polis, especially the members of the \\"Association of the Friends of the Peir√≥polis Palaeontological Site\\".

As a free agent, many teams were involved in bidding on Soler's \\"services.\\" Scouting profile Soler is and weighs . He was described as a power-hitting outfielder who would likely play right field. Jim Callis of Baseball America described Soler in 2011 as \\"a 19-year-old athlete with five-tool potential.\\" According to Callis, Soler likely would have been a top-five pick in the 2010 draft had he been eligible. Kevin Goldstein of Baseball Prospectus did not rank Soler in his list of the top baseball prospects prior to the 2012 season, but said he would have ranked Soler as the 38th or 39th best prospect if he were eligible. Some teams preferred Soler to higher profile Cuban defector Yoenis C√©spedes. Keith Law of ESPN.com indicated that Soler had the talent of a top-five draft choice in the 2012 Major League Baseball Draft, had he been eligible to be drafted. Writing for Fox News, Mauricio Rubio wrote that \\"Early in his career he was benched for not hustling, and in a separate incident he ran toward an opposing dugout with a bat.\\" Writing for the Sporting News, Jeff Mans noted that: \\"The biggest issue with Soler aside from the hamstring injuries is his temper.... He started out on the wrong foot with the Cubs after failing to report to minor league camp shortly after signing his nine-year, $30 million deal, feeling that he should have been in Chicago immediately. The other scare for the Cubs brass was his relative inability to hit righthanded pitching.\\" According to Statcast, Soler's average launch speed was in 2016. American career Minor League Baseball On June 11, 2012, Soler reportedly agreed to a nine-year $30 million contract with the Chicago Cubs.

Life The son of Cuthbert Sharp, shipowner, and of Susannah, sister of Brass Crosby, he was born at Hartlepool, County Durham, England in 1781, and received his education at Greenwich under Charles Burney. There he formed a lasting friendship with Lord Lake and with Sir Edward Blakeney. When he was eighteen years of age he served in Ireland during the rebellion as an officer in the fencible cavalry. When his regiment was disbanded, Sharp went to Edinburgh, and in 1803 visited Paris. There he was stranded by the resumption of hostilities at the conclusion of the Peace of Amiens, and detained, with other English visitors, as a prisoner of war. But by the influence of Claude Ambroise R√©gnier, the Minister of Justice, whom he knew, he was released on parole, and after a few years was allowed to leave for England. Sharp settled at Hartlepool married Elizabeth Croudace, and took up the study of local antiquities. In 1816 he acted as mayor, and was knighted on the occasion of a visit of the Prince Regent. In 1823 Sharp was appointed collector of customs at Sunderland. In 1845 he was promoted to the post of collector of customs at Newcastle-on-Tyne, where he resided until his death on 17 August 1849. Works In 1816 appeared his first book, The History of Hartlepool (2nd ed. 1851), which made his reputation as an antiquarian. Sharp came to know Robert Surtees, the historian of County Durham, and helped him with local genealogies. His contributions to Surtees's History of Durham were distinguished by the initials C. S. surmounted by a rose. In 1840 appeared his Memorials of the Rebellion of 1569, based on the Bowes Manuscripts.

He was mentioned in the Domesday Book as being responsible for Monmouth Castle and ten other manors in the surrounding region, and was responsible in 1101 for the consecration of the town's Priory which had been established in 1075 by his uncle Withenoc. Life He was the son of Baderon, a nobleman of La Boussac, near Dol in Brittany. Baderon was the son of Caradoc de La Boussac, a nobleman with estates near Dol in Brittany. Baderon's brother Withenoc (or Gwithenoc) was appointed lord of Monmouth by King William after the disgrace of Roger de Breteuil in 1075, and founded the Priory at Monmouth. The pious Withenoc then gave up his secular responsibilities in about 1082 to become a monk at Saumur, and, because his own son Raterius and his brother Baderon were also monks, the responsibilities fell on Baderon's son, William. Withenoc's responsibilities initially passed for a short time to Ranulf de Colville, perhaps because William had not yet reached adulthood. K. S. B.

Besides his castle at Monmouth, he was also lord of Huntley, Longhope, Ruardean, and Siddington, in Gloucestershire; and of Ashperton, Hope Mansell, Munsley, Stretton Grandison, Walsopthorne and Whitwick, in Herefordshire. At Monmouth, he may have been responsible for completing the rebuilding of the original wooden motte and bailey castle in stone. He and his family, together with his vassals, their wives, and Wihenoc, were present when Monmouth Priory was consecrated in 1101. William was of sufficient eminence to attract to the ceremony such notables as King Henry's chaplain, Bernard. William granted, to the abbey of Saint Florent at Saumur, the Priory Church of St Mary at Monmouth, \\"and all their churches, and the tithes of all their lands and of all their tenants, namely, of grain, of stock, of honey, of iron, of mills, of cheeses, and of whatever is tithed.

History  Memorial to Evans County veterans On August 11, 1914, less than one month after the beginning of World War I, the Georgia General Assembly proposed a constitutional amendment to create Evans County from Bulloch and Tattnall counties. Evans County was approved through the constitutional amendment process because of an earlier amendment from 1904 which limited the number of counties to 145. In order to get around this amendment, a new amendment was passed which allowed for the creation of Evans County. Georgia voters ratified the proposed amendment by a vote of 36,689 to 9,789Public Affairs Information Service Bulletin, Accessed August 30, 2008 on November 3, 1914, which marks the official date of Evans County's creation. There have been many significant events during the county's history. June 24, 1940 marked the appointment of Josie Mae Rogers to the position of sheriff; she would later become the first female sheriff elected in the county and in Georgia. Another is the creation of Fort Stewart Georgia in July 1940, which displaced approximately 1,500 people. In 1958, Dr. Curtis Gordon Hames began research on the Evans County Hear Study, which was funded by the National Institute of Health. And on December 28, 1994 a monument to Evans County's veterans was erected by the local chapter of the American Legion. On June 3, 2008 Evans County commissioners unanimously passed a resolution to mark August 11 as Evans County Day. Since that day there have been annual celebrations of the county's founding and preparations for the 2014 centennial celebration. Architecture The George W. DeLoach House in Hagan, Georgia A number of buildings and homes in Evans County are on the National Register of Historic Places. In Claxton, there is the Dr. James W. Daniel House; the Evans County Courthouse; and the Mitchell J. Green Plantation. In Hagan, there is the George W. DeLoach House. And at Camp Oliver there is the Glissom, Remer, Store (DOE). Other places of interest include the Daisy Post Office and the train depot in Bellville. Evans County is also home to a number of antebellum houses that were built prior to the formation of the county. Many of these homes were built in the Plantation Plain style and include the A.D. Eason House; the Thomas A. Durrence House; and the Edwards-Strickland House.  Customs  Shriners participating in the annual Rattlesnake Roundup Parade in Claxton, Evans County, Georgia Evans County has held an annual rattlesnake roundup the second weekend of March since 1968, with the roundup festival growing every year since then and moving from within Claxton to just outside the city in 2001. Recently, the roundup has undergone a change and is now The Claxton Rattlesnake and Wildlife Festival. Another, more recent, annual event is the Cruisin' in the Country Bike Ride, which began in 1995 as the Yuletide Ride. The event was changed from December to November the next year and expanded to include a route. Eventually, the route became a complete century ride. Other events include the Martin Luther King Day parade, held every January. Christmas in Claxton, which occurs on the first Saturday in December, includes arts and crafts, food, and the Parade of Lights. The Richey Arena has barrel racing and other activities. Lastly, there is a tractor pull held on the first Saturday of each month at the Longneedle Farm Truck and Tractor Pull. An annual Chicken Pickin' festival has also been held annually since September 11, 2010. Cuisine Skillet-baked cornbread Evans County's cuisine includes a variety of different foods ranging from seafood, corn on the cob and chicken and dumplings to Brunswick stew, fried chicken and cornbread. Other well known and loved foods in the county include pecans, peaches and peanuts. However, these are not the only foods enjoyed by Evans Countians. Because of the diversity within the county, the people of Evans County also frequent Mexican and Chinese restaurants.

Media  The Claxton Enterprise is a weekly newspaper located in Claxton, Georgia, USA. It primarily serves Evans County, Georgia. The Enterprise was established in 1912 with its first issue being published on December 4, 1912. The current publisher is Mitchell Peace. Two radio stations serve the Evans County area. WCLA (1470 AM) is an AM station which plays Gospel music and Oldies, as well as providing local news and weather. WAWS (107.3 FM) is an FM station which plays contemporary Christian music.  Sports and recreation  Sports in Evans County include the Claxton High School athletic program and the Pinewood Christian Academy athletic program. The county is also home to a handful of public areas which are set aside for recreation. The Evans County Public Fishing Area, located in Claxton, is one such area and contains three lakes of 8, 30 and 84 acres and primitive campsites. Families can also picnic at the lake and an outdoor classroom is available for use. Parks include Bacon Ford Park and the Senior Citizens Park in Claxton. Two parks in Hagan are the Maggie Mae Lewis Children's Park and the Bradley Memorial Park. Another outdoor recreational area is the Evans Heights Golf Club. The course was designed by Don Cottle, Jr. in 1970 and has Bermuda Grass. In total, the course is 6,514 yards.

T. Schaefer Building in Schulenburg, Texas The Schulenburg Sticker is a weekly newspaper in Schulenburg, Texas. It is published every Thursday except during the week of Christmas. It has been in continuous publication since 1894. The Schulenburg Sticker is currently owned by the Vyvjala family of Schulenburg.  History  Earlier newspapers Some of the Sticker's predecessors were the Commercial, the Messenger, the Schulenburg Enterprise, Schulenburg Siftings, the Schulenburg Globe, and the Schulenburg Argus. Schulenburg Argus was published from 1877 to 1878 by Pocohontas Edmondson, founder of the Flatonia Argus. First publication Ernst Goeth, a German immigrant, began publishing the Sticker in 1894. Goeth claimed that despite earlier newspaper failures in Schulenburg, his paper would \\"stick\\" around. Although the earliest issues are now lost, calculations show the first issue of the Sticker was published August 16, 1894. Ownership Around 1900, Goeth sold the paper to W. S. Moore, who owned it about a year, then sold it to William Reynolds King. At that time, the circulation totaled about 1,000. From 1903 to 1914, the Sticker was published by Raymond R. Winfree. During his tenure, the paper shared an upstairs office at 625 1/2 North Main with Engelbert F. Theuer's German newspaper Texas Volksfreund (published 1904-16). During the ownership of D. O. Bell & Son (1914‚Äì20), the Sticker changed from a gasoline engine to electricity to run its presses. Another short-term owner was Jack A. Price (1920‚Äì21). However, for the next 50-plus years, various members of the Bosl family maintained continuous ownership. Ernest A. Bosl was the first to have ownership of the newspaper, from 1921 to 1935. In 1923, records showed the Sticker was at the corner of Lyons and Anderson. But in February 1934, the Sticker moved to its present location at 405 North Main in the S. T. Schaefer building. More room was needed for new equipment, including a 10,000-pound press. The Schaefer building, containing three offices on the ground floor, was completed in 1896. It originally housed Schaefer's office; his store, which sold paint, building materials, and undertakers' supplies; and Palace Saloon. The Sticker was handset until September 1934, when a Model 8 Linotype was installed. A newspaper page set by Linotype weighed about 50 pounds. On Jan. 1, 1935, E.A. Bosl sold the Sticker to his brother, Charles F. Bosl, and John Guilford McMillan, who started as Sticker foreman in 1921. On Aug. 4, 1937, Charles Bosl married Florence Barry, who became associated with the paper. In 1946, Charles and Florence Bosl bought McMillan's interest. Then in 1959, McMillan transferred ownership of his print shop to the Sticker and the two were combined. Throughout most of its history, the Sticker has maintained a print shop - it is still an integral part of the business today. After Charles' death on Oct. 31, 1954, Florence remained active in the Sticker. She became an international correspondent, winning many awards for her writing. Starting in 1967, she leased the paper, while continuing as owner/executive editor, to Mr. and Mrs. Joe Vyvjala, 1967‚Äì68; Mr. and Mrs. G. Frank Bridges, 1968‚Äì71; and Lester Zapalac, 1971-77. In late 1971, the Sticker used its first computer (the old-style Compugraphic), although the Linotype was not yet completely retired. After Florence Bosl died on March 26, 1972, the Sticker was sold to Tex-Print Corporation, a subsidiary of Todd Publications Inc. of Austin, owned by William K. and Dorothy Todd and family. Zapalac's lease contract, however, did not expire until 1977. On Nov. 1, 1975, Joe Vyvjala and brother-in-law Max J. Nikel Sr. bought the Sticker. On March 1, 1984, Vyvjala, who had been employed at the Sticker since 1956, became sole proprietor. In April 1987, the Sticker purchased the adjacent office space at 401 North Main (originally Palace Saloon), and moved its offices there in 1993. That same year, Joe retired, though he remains publisher emeritus. His wife, Maxine, now runs the business, with their children Darrell Vyvjala and Diane Prause as editors. Coincidentally, in 1994, Maxine and son-in-law Paul Prause bought the Flatonia Argus newspaper, where Joe got his start in 1942. Since 1986, the Vyvjala family has been attending the annual South Texas Press Association conventions. From 1994-99, Maxine served as STPA director. The Sticker's circulation now totals about 3,000. Awards The front office of the Sticker is lined with more than 50 awards, which the Sticker has won over the past twelve years in regional newspaper contests - on entries ranging from sports to news to features to family/social pages. Among the awards are eleven first place plaques and a runner-up award for \\"best all around\\" in the South Texas Press Association contest in 1993. 2012 staff See also * List of newspapers in Texas  References   External links  * Category:Newspapers published in Texas Category:Fayette County, Texas Category:Publications established in 1894 ","title":"Schulenburg Sticker"},{"id":"34361897","text":"Lajam Gir (, also Romanized as LajƒÅm Gƒ´r) is a village in Shurab Rural District, Veysian District, Dowreh County, Lorestan Province, Iran.

The National Academies of Science said that Wells \\"made an indelible mark on the world of paleontology.\\" The Independent called Wells \\"the leading authority on modern and fossil corals, a noteworthy contributor on coral reefs and atolls\\". Wells was Professor of Geology, Ohio State University, Professor of Geology, Cornell University, President, Paleontological Society, a member of the National Academy of Sciences.  Early life  Wells was bom July 15, 1907, in Philadelphia, PA. He went to school in Homer, NY, 20 miles northeast of Ithaca. He took his B.S. degree at the University of Pittsburgh, majoring in chemistry. However he soon became fascinated by geology, under the guidance of Ransom E. Sommers and Henry Leighton.  Early career  Wells became an instructor of geology at the University of Texas from 1929-1931, whilst studying for his M.A. from Cornell University in 1930, with a special interest in paleontology. He took his Ph.D. from Cornell in 1933 under Gilbert D. Harris. During 1933-1934, Wells was a National Research Council Fellow, studying paleontology at the British Museum (Natural History), in London, the French National Museum of Natural History (Paris), and the Natural History Museum of Berlin. Upon his return to the U.S., Wells worked with T. Wayland Vaughan in Washington, D.C. from 1935-1937, and \\"looked for a job.\\" Together they revised a volume on Scleractinia (1943). Wells taught at the State Normal School at Fredonia, New York (now SUNY) from 1937 to 1938, and then was a Professor in Geology at Ohio State University from 1938-1948. At Ohio State University, he would begin researching the history of geology. Wells served in the military in France and Germany during 1944-45 in the Office of Strategic Services, and later assisted with studies assessing war damage and in the recovery of coral literature from bombed or burning buildings in Germany. His work with OSS assessed the state of universities and museums in France and Germany, following the war.  Later career  Wells returned to Cornell in 1948 as professor of geology. He served as department chairman from 1962-1965. In 1946 he began working with the U.S. Geological Survey. He was involved in research into various Pacific islands, including field work in the resurvey of Bikini Atoll (1947) and was attached to the Pacific Science Board‚Äôs Arno Atoll Expedition (1950). He would continue to identify, describe, and analyze the Recent and Tertiary corals from these and other expeditions even in his retirement. Many of his publications were the direct result of this Pacific island work. During 1954, Wells was granted a Fulbright lecturing position at the University of Queensland, spending many months studying corals of the Great Barrier Reef. This period of time would establish a productive working relationship for he and Dorothy Hill of the University of Queensland, who was the leading Australian expert on reef geology. Wells and Dorothy Hill would jointly prepare nine sections on the Coelenterata for the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology published in 1956. Wells would also prepare sections on Scleractinia for the Treatise. Wells' most widely read paper appeared in November 1962 and was published in Nature. Astronomers and geophysicists paid attention to his ‚ÄúCoral Growth and Geochronometry‚Äù paper, which demonstrated their theory that the earth's rotation was slowing down. His research indicated that there were more days in the Devonian year (400) compared with those of the modern age (365), by comparing counts of daily growth lines in corals. Wells' paper generated a great amount of research on the incremental growth of skeletal material in several groups of invertebrates. J. B. S. Haldane described Wells' work in an article published in the New York Times, Professor Wells of Cornell University also has this quality. He collects ancient and modern coral. Those which grow in seas where the temperature varies much with the seasons often show annual growth rings like trees. Wells found that some also show daily ridges of growth, which can be counted with a good hand lens costing perhaps $10. Modern corals show about 365 ridges a year‚Ä¶.Silurian corals show about 400 rings a year. As the year has probably changed little, therefore the days have been getting longer. (They are getting longer, as we know, from records of ancient eclipses, among other evidence. This is thought to be due to the braking action of the tides, both in the sea and in the earth, which is not quite rigid.) Ask anyone who does not know the answer how much the apparatus cost which proved that the number of days in the year has increased by 35 in 350 million years and he will probably guess at $10 million or so. Wells would retire from Cornell in 1973, and become Emeritus Professor. In 1975 he travelled to the Charles Darwin Research Station in the Galapagos Islands and helped identify six new species of azooxanthellate corals. John Wells' long-standing interests and research into local and cultural history, especially that of upstate New York, were able to flourish in retirement. In 1958, he published The Cayuga Bridge, a story of New York local history. The summer home on Cayuga Lake, that Wells and his wife established in 1948, would host students, colleagues, and other friends from around the world, for decades. Wells had an important collection of early works on American and European geology.  Selected publications   * Wells, J.W.

The company holds more than 1,200 stores in over thirteen states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. TMX Finance‚Äôs brands serve individuals who generally have limited access to consumer credit from banks, thrift institutions, credit card lenders, and other traditional sources of consumer credit. TitleMax markets easy cash to borrowers with ‚Äúgood credit, bad credit, or no credit‚Äù secured by the title to their car. In Dallas, San Antonio, and Austin ‚Äì which have all passed lending laws ‚Äì those loans have come with zero percent interest. After 30 days, however, the loan is due in full. If the borrower cannot pay ‚ÄìTitleMax‚Äôs average loan is for $1,300 ‚Äì the borrower is sent to another TitleMax location outside of the city, where he or she can receive a new, unrestricted loan. The borrower would be free to renew the loan at that location indefinitely. That loan, states a contract given to one borrower, could have an annual rate as high as 310 percent. TMX is owned by Tracy Young of Savannah, Georgia.  Brands  TMX Finance is the parent company to TitleMax and changed its name from TitleMax Holdings, LLC, to TMX Finance LLC as of June 21, 2010. TMX Finance oversees 728 stores and employs over 3,300 people nationwide. In almost 1,000 stores, the Company operates as TitleMax; in almost 200 stores, the Company uses a TitleBucks brand. TMX Finance also offers a second-lien automobile product in Georgia under the EquityAuto Loan brand, with operations conducted within 122 TitleMax stores and through 4 standalone stores. Monday, February 17, 2020 Family of brands under TMX Finance LLC  Industry overview  Customers use the services provided by the alternative financial services industry for a variety of reasons, including that they often: do not have access to traditional credit- based lenders like banks, thrift institutions, and credit card companies; have a sudden and unexpected need for cash due to common financial challenges like medical emergencies, vehicle repairs, divorce, job changes, or other unexpected expenses; are self-employed small business owners with an immediate need for short-term working capital; need a small amount of cash immediately and do not have time to wait for a traditional lender to approve a loan; and see such services as a sensible alternative to potentially higher costs and negative credit consequences of other alternatives, such as overdraft fees, bounced check fees, or late fees. This industry has thrived on the use of arbitration clauses with class action waivers in their loan agreements. Every lawsuit filed against a company in this industry will be removed from court based on the arbitration clause. A borrower seeking relief will then have to arbitrate his or her case individually, and not as a class action. The industry has lobbied heavily for the deregulation of lending and lifting of usury laws.

Reporters Without Borders has described him as a \\"leading journalist\\" and \\"one of his country‚Äôs leading free speech advocates\\". Background Rasheed worked for a time as the youngest acting editor of the Maldivian newspaper Haveeru. Haveeru Daily was the longest serving and highest circulated news paper since its inception and removed from operation by a Court order in 2016. Hilath came to national attention in early 2010, when he was charged by the government with atheism, drug use, and homosexuality, allegedly in retaliation for his human rights reporting. He also received several death threats, and material appeared on Maldivian websites calling for his beheading, leading the Maldives Journalist Association to offer a statement in his support. Blog closing In November 2011, his website, www.hilath.com, was shut down by Communications Authority of the Maldives (CAM) on the order of the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, on the grounds that the site contained \\"anti-Islamic material\\". Islam is the only legal religion for Maldivian nationals under the 2008 Maldives Constitution, with Sunni Islam predominant. Rasheed defended his blog as an expression of his Sufism and condemned the censorship as Sunni intolerance. In a visit to Mal√© the same month, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navanethem Pillay described the blog's closing as a \\"disturbing act\\" raising concerns about a \\"rise in religious inolerance\\". Reporters Without Borders also condemned the closure, stating that \\"the increase in acts of religious intolerance is a threat to the Maldives' young democracy\\". December 2011 arrest and response On 10 December, Rasheed organized a 30-person rally in Mal√© calling for religious tolerance. The rally was attacked by ten men throwing stones, one of which fractured Rasheed's skull, causing him to be hospitalized. Following the protest, members of the Maldives' opposition Adhaalath Party called for Rasheed's arrest and called for a 23 December counterdemonstration to protect Islam. A website for these protests again called for the murder of \\"those against Islam\\". Amnesty International reported that the Government of the Maldives made no effort to locate Rasheed's attackers, despite \\"credible photographic evidence of the attack\\". On 14 December, Rasheed was detained on a charge of questioning the constitution, later amended to \\"involvement in an unlawful assembly\\". Amnesty International described the charge as a \\"clear example of the erosion of freedom of expression in the Maldives,\\" named Rasheed a prisoner of conscience, and demanded his immediate release. Reporters Without Borders also condemned the arrest, stating that \\"it is disturbing to see the government yet again yielding to pressure from the most conservative fringes of Maldivian society\\". Rasheed later stated that he faced mistreatment while in custody and that Maldivian prison conditions remained \\"unchanged\\" since the reign of autocratic president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom. The Maldivian Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement pledging an independent inquiry into Rasheed's allegations. Rasheed's detention was extended twice on request of investigating officers, in order that the Islamic Ministry might provide him counseling to \\"bring him back to Islam\\". He was released on 10 January after 24 days' detention.  Stabbing  On 5 June 2012, Rasheed was stabbed in the neck near his house in Mal√©. A hospital source stated that the blade had missed cutting left jugular artery, but that Rasheed stabilized following a vascular surgery done in the ADK Hospital. Reporters Without Borders stated that it appeared that he had been deliberately targeted for his journalism. A minister of the Maldivian government condemned the attack, but also added \\"Hilath must have known that he had become a target of a few extremists ... We are not a secular country.

The building was designed by F.A.Powell who was the eldest son of the Mayor of Monmouth, Mr Champney Powell. The hall was given to celebrate the Queen's Jubilee in 1888. A new organ was installed in 1889 which had novel additions to its design by William Sweetland, and the following year several paintings were installed. In September 1890, a successful Fine Art and Industrial Exhibition was held in the building; the catalogue can be seen in the Monmouth Museum. Between 1897 and 1903, the Hall was used for a number of plays staged by the actor, director and impresario Ben Greet. The linked emblems of the Rolls family and that of the town of Monmouth QRpedia codes in books In 1963 the organ was inspected by an organ tuner who declared it to be useless. Water had affected the sounding boards and the instrument was falling to pieces. This was reported in the local paper but the organ remained in place for at least three years when the hall was used as a dance hall, and later as a night club. In 1992, the building became used for the town's public library, which had previously been located at the Shire Hall. The Library was refurbished in 2010 with a ¬£210,000 grant from the Museums Archives and Libraries: Wales, which matched funding from the County Council. The library still honours its original benefactors as large full length portraits of John Rolls, 1st Baron Llangattock, his wife Lady Llangattock and his son John Rolls, 2nd Baron Llangattock are the main decoration on one wall. However the floor mosaic, that showed the Rolls and Monmouth symbols linked together, is now exhibited on another wall.

In April 2017, the newly formed European company Dante Labs started offering the WGS for $900. In 2017, Beijing Genomics Institute began offering WGS for $600. In July 2018, on Amazon Prime Day, Dante Labs offered it for $349. In November 2018, around the time of Black Friday, Dante Labs offered WGS for the first time less than $200, and Veritas Genetics for two days for the same price of $199 offered WGS limited to a thousand customers. In March of the same year, geneticist Matthew Hurles of Wellcome Sanger Institute noted that the private companies, including Illumina, are currently competing to reach a new target for WGS of only $100. In February 2020, Nebula Genomics started offering WGS for $299. Archon Genomics X PRIZE It was originally announced that the revamped Archon Genomics X PRIZE presented by Medco would hold a $10-million grand prize competition in January 2013 for the team that reaches (or comes closest to reaching) the $1,000 genome. The grand prize would go to \\"the team(s) able to sequence 100 human genomes within 30 days to an accuracy of 1 error per 1,000,000 bases, with 98% completeness, identification of insertions, deletions and rearrangements, and a complete haplotype, at an audited total cost of $1,000 per genome.\\" In August 2013 the Archon Genomics X PRIZE was cancelled, as the founders felt it had been \\"Outpaced by Innovation,\\" and \\"was not incentivizing the technological changes\\".

It is used for the monitoring of servers, applications, networks, cloud infrastructures (public, private, hybrid), containers, storage, databases and environment sensors. Checkmk is available in three editions: an open source edition (\\"Checkmk Raw Edition ‚Äì CRE\\"), a commercial enterprise edition (\\"Checkmk Enterprise Edition ‚Äì CEE\\") and a commercial edition for managed services providers (\\"Checkmk Managed Services Edition ‚Äì CME\\"). These Checkmk-Editions are available for a range of platforms, in particular for various versions of Debian, Ubuntu, SLES and RedHat / CentOS, and also as a Docker Image. In addition, physical appliances of various sizes as well as a virtual appliance are offered to simplify the administration of the underlying operating system through a graphical user interface and to enable high- availability solutions. The agents used by Checkmk to collect data are available for 11 platforms, including Windows.  History  Checkmk originated in 2008 as an Agent-substituting shell script for Inetd, and was published in April 2009 under GPL. It was initially based on Nagios, and extended this with a number of new components. The open source edition (Checkmk Raw Edition) also continues to be based on the Nagios-core, and bundles this with additional open source components into a complete system. Over many years Checkmk's commercial editions have evolved into a self- contained monitoring system ‚Äì one that has replaced all of the essential Nagios components with its own ‚Äì including its very own monitoring core. The majority of the developments for the commercial editions, in particular all plug-ins, are also available into the Checkmk Raw Edition. While in the past Checkmk was designed for monitoring large and heterogeneous on-premise environments, from version 1.5+ (1.5p12) it also supports the monitoring of AWS, Azure, Docker and Kubernetes services. Checkmk is being developed by tribe29 GmbH in Munich Germany, which until 16.04.2019 operated under the name of Mathias Kettner GmbH. Together with the company name change, the product name \\"Check_MK\\" was also changed to \\"Checkmk\\". tribe29 GmbH follows an open core business model. The open source edition is available under different open source licenses ‚Äì mostly GPLv2, while large parts of the commercial editions run under the proprietary \\"Checkmk Enterprise License\\".  The Product  Checkmk combines three types of IT monitoring: * Status-based monitoring, which (via thresholds) records the \\"health\\" of a device or application. * Metric-based monitoring that enables the recording and analysis of time series graphs. For the CEE both an HTML5-based graphing system and an integration with Grafana are available. * Log-based and event-based monitoring, in which key events can be filtered out and actions can be triggered based on these events. In order to ensure a very broad monitoring, Checkmk currently has 1700+ plug-ins in each edition ‚Äì all of which are licensed under GPLv2. These plug-ins are maintained as part of the product and are regularly supplemented with additional plug-ins or extensions. Connecting existing legacy Nagios plug-ins is possible as well. To simplify setup and operation, all components of Checkmk are delivered fully integrated. A rule-based 1:n configuration, as well as a high degree of automation significantly accelerate workflows. This includes: * Auto-discovery of hosts (where applicable) * Auto-discovery of services * Automated configuration of plug-ins via preconfigured thresholds and rules * Automated agent updates (a CEE feature) * Automatic and dynamic configuration that enables the monitoring of volatile services with a lifespan of just a few seconds, such as in the Kubernetes environment (starting from CEE v1.6) * Automated discovery of tags and labels from sources such as Kubernetes, AWS and Azure (starting from CEE v1.6) In addition, there are also playbooks for the use of configuration and deployment tools such as Ansible or Salt. Checkmk is often used in very large distributed environments where a high number of sites (e.g. 300 locations of Faurecia) and/or well over 100.000 devices (e.g. Edeka) are monitored. This is possible, among other things, because Checkmk's microcore consumes much less CPU resources than, for example Nagios, and therefore offers a significantly higher performance on the same hardware. Furthermore the non-persistent data is stored in-memory in RAM which significantly improves the access time.  Components   The Monitoring Core (\\"Checkmk Microcore - CMC\\")  The commercial editions of Checkmk use their own monitoring core, written in C++. This has a much higher performance than the Nagios core. In addition, as of version 1.6 it allows the dynamic recording of objects with a short lifespan, such as Containers. This is possible because - in contrast to the Nagios core - the Checkmk Microcore does not require a reboot when making configuration changes. The open source version \\"Checkmk Raw Edition\\" currently still uses the Nagios core.  Configuration & Check Engine  Checkmk offers self-contained service discovery and settings generation. Checkmk uses its own method when carrying out the checks. During the test period each host is contacted only once. The test results are transmitted to the monitoring core as passive checks. This significantly improves the performance on the monitoring server, as well as on the hosts being monitored. Checkmk uses different methods to access the data in the target systems. These include agents installed on the target system, \\"special agents\\" running on the monitoring server and communicating with the API of the target system, the SNMP API for monitoring, for example, network devices and printers, and HTTP/TCP protocols to communicate with web and internet services. By default, Checkmk follows the \\"pull principle\\", i.e. the data is explicitly queried by the monitoring system to quickly identify when a system suddenly fails and does not respond to a \\"pull\\". As an alternative, however, a \\"push\\" can be configured with which the system transfers its data directly to Checkmk or to an intermediate host.  Data Interface (\\"Livestatus\\")  Livestatus is the main interface in Checkmk. It provides live access to all data from the monitored hosts and services. The data is fetched directly from the RAM, which avoids slow hard disk access and gives fast access to the information without overloading the system too much. Access is done via a simple protocol and it is possible from all programming languages without requiring a special library.  Web-GUI (\\"Multisite\\")  Multisite is Checkmk‚Äôs web GUI. In addition to having a quick page layout, it offers user-definable views and dashboards, distributed monitoring by integrating multiple monitoring instances via Livestatus, integration of NagVis, an integrated LDAP connection, access to status data via web services, and much more. Dashboards and views can be differentiated for various users or groups of users, for example vSphere-specific views for VMware admins. The web GUI is currently available both in German and English.  Web Administration (\\"WATO\\")  The Web Administration Tool makes a system based on Checkmk completely administrable via the browser. This includes managing users, roles, groups, time periods, and more. Permissions can be granted in a granular way using a role concept. Existing role-based access controls (LDAP, AD) can be used for this. The WATO works rule-based, so that the configuration remains intuitive even in complex environments, and the necessary effort is low. Automatic discovery and configuration, as well as the automatic agent update further accelerate the configuration process. An HTTP API can also be used to integrate CMDBs for accelerated configuration.  Alert System  Several notification channels can be set up and configured with different rules for each user. For example, emails can be triggered at any time of the day, but notifications via SMS are sent only for important issues during on-call hours. The notifications can be set for all or for specific teams, e.g. notify only the storage admins about a failed hard drive. Duplicate notifications are grouped together so that no user is notified twice through a particular channel. Furthermore, users can configure their own notifications themselves. In distributed environments alerts can be managed centrally. For detected issues, actions can be triggered automatically (alarm control) via scripts. Checkmk includes integrations to email and SMS gateways as well as to communication and IT service-management solutions such as Slack , Jira , PagerDuty , OpsGenie , VictorOps and ServiceNow.  Business Intelligence  The BI module is integrated into the graphical user interface. It aggregates the overall status of business processes, their dependency on complex applications and IT infrastructure elements from many individual hosts and services in a rule-based manner. It can also be used to represent applications made up of microservices, which in turn consist of Kubernetes pods and deployments. In addition, worst-case scenarios can be simulated in real time and historical data can be analyzed to understand the causes of performance degradation.  Event Console  The Event Console integrates the processing of log messages and SNMP traps into the monitoring. It is configured via a flexible set of rules, and decides whether incoming messages are to be discarded or how they are to be classified. It can count, correlate, expect messages, rewrite messages, and more. Similar entries can be grouped into a single event (e.g. multiple failed logins) to keep track of events. It also has a built-in syslog daemon that receives messages directly on port 514, and an SNMP trap receiver that receives traps on port 162.  Metrics Graphing  The commercial Checkmk editions use their own metric and graphing system. This allows time series metrics to be analysed over long intervals using interactive HTML5 graphs. The maximum resolution is one second. Data can be imported from a variety of data sources and metrics formats (JSON, XML, SNMP etc.) and stored on the disk of a long-term data storage device. Alternatively, Graphite or InfluxDB can be connected via an export interface. From CEE version 1.5p16 there is also a plug-in available for integrating data directly from Checkmk into Grafana for visualization purposes. The Checkmk Raw Edition currently uses PNP4Nagios as its graphing system.  Reporting  Reporting enables the direct delivery of PDF reports, ad-hoc or automatically, at regular intervals. It includes the availability analysis in which the history of the states over any desired time period can be provided with a click. Availability calculations can exclude unmonitored times, adjust the resolution, or ignore short intervals. In addition to the availability calculations, reporting also includes SLA reporting in which complex SLAs can be monitored. The reporting is only available in the commercial versions of Checkmk.  Hardware/Software Inventory  The hardware/software inventory can be used, for example, to monitor hardware and software changes, to verify the presence of installed security updates, and to update static data with dynamic parameters (for example, updating the current disk usage statistics based on monitoring data). The Configuration Management Database (CMDB) i-doit has a deep integration that enables the exchange of CMDB data with monitoring data.

They maintain an affiliated PAC and a nonprofit legal foundation. Officially incorporated in Virginia on March 29, 2000, NAGR was founded by Dudley Brown as a national companion organization to Rocky Mountain Gun Owners. NAGR is a rival of the National Rifle Association and considers itself the \\"conservative alternative\\" to the NRA. The group spends most of its energy attacking lawmakers deemed too soft on Second Amendment issues via direct mail, robocalls and low-cost television ads. The group has gained notoriety for its aggressive lobbying tactics and attack ads. Activities National Association for Gun Rights is opposed to the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty. The organization is also opposed to legislative actions on high-capacity magazines. National Association for Gun Rights opposes efforts led by Citizens for Self-Governance to call a convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution to rein in the powers of the federal government. When a vacancy arose in the Colorado State Legislature in 2012, NAGR supported Tim Neville over State Representative Jim Kerr, whom they felt was not sufficiently supportive of Second Amendment rights. In 2012, National Association for Gun Rights sued the state of Montana over state laws that may require the organization to register as a political committee prior to mailing postcards critical of Montana Attorney General Steve Bullock's record on gun rights. According to the IRS, \\"a section 501(c)(4)... may engage in some political activities, so long as that is not its primary activity.\\" National Association for Gun Rights' request for a preliminary injunction was denied in October. Bullock was elected Governor the following month. In March 2015, National Association for Gun Rights was involved in opposing gun control measures in Vermont. The NAGR campaigned to stop the Vermont state legislature from passing SB 141. Also in March 2015, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) initiated a rule change that would ban M855 ball ammunition for civilian use. NAGR reported delivering 132,662 petitions to the ATF that urged the agency to stop the ammunition ban. National Association for Gun Rights supports the passage of no-permit Constitutional carry. In April 2015, NAGR supported Kansas bill SB 45, which allows for Constitutional carry. NAGR representatives were present at the bill signing on April 2. In June 2015, National Association for Gun Rights sent out mailers targeting Republican William J. Howell, the Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates. According to The Washington Post, NAGR's mailer \\"Portrayed Howell as being friendly to rapists\\" by depicting a woman cowering before a knife-wielding assailant alongside the text \\"Speaker Bill Howell thinks you should be left vulnerable to armed thugs and rapists!\\" Howell had been endorsed by the NRA and said he was a \\"100 percent supporter of the Second Amendment\\". Howell described the mailers as \\"pretty low by even today's political standards\\". In 2015, the Colorado State Legislature considered amending a 2013 law that limited magazines to 15 rounds. The legislature wanted to increase the limit to 30 rounds. Brown rejected the proposed increase on the grounds that there should be no limit at all. NAGR was criticized for their position, with Jon Caldara of the libertarian Independence Institute calling NAGR head Dudley Brown a \\"bully\\". Disagreement with the National Rifle Association In November 2011, the U.S. House passed legislation that would require states that issue concealed gun permits to recognize similar licenses from other states. The bill was supported by the National Rifle Association which considered it to be a top priority, but opposed by the NAGR on the basis that it could become a \\"Trojan horse for more gun control\\". A 2014 Newsmax article compared the NRA and NAGR, noting differences such as the NRA's substantially larger budget. In 2013, NAGR spent close to $1.9 million on gun lobbying during the first three months of the year, while the NRA reported spending $700,000 on the same issue. The NRA has referred to NAGR leader Dudley Brown as \\"the Al Sharpton of the gun movement\\". NAGR has pointed out the NRA's financial and verbal support of gun control champions such as Nevada Senator Harry Reid as an indication of just how misguided their efforts are. The Huffington Post described NAGR as \\"The much leaner, more pugnacious version of the NRA. Where the NRA has looked to find some common ground with gun reform advocates and at least appear to be reasonable, NAGR has been the unapologetic champion of opening up gun laws even more.\\" In a 2019 Politico article, NAGR president Dudley Brown described the differences between his organization and the NRA \\"As an organization, we don‚Äôt use Gucci-loafered lobbyists in Washington, D.C. in $200,000 wardrobes to grease the palms of weak-kneed politicians to vote right,‚Äù said Dudley Brown, president of the National Association for Gun Rights, referencing the NRA chief executive‚Äôs purported lavish spending. ‚ÄúInstead, we activate our members to do that lobbying for us and for them. That‚Äôs the power in a grassroots lobby and NRA lost that a long time ago.‚Äù NAGR president Dudley Brown  National Foundation for Gun Rights  Through its foundation, National Association for Gun Rights filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Postal Service, Bonidy v. USPS for prohibiting the carrying of firearms on Postal Service property. The 10th circuit ruled in favor of the gun ban, and the Supreme Court refused to consider the case, by denying a writ of certiorari. During the McDonald v. Chicago Supreme Court case, an amicus brief filed by NAGR was cited by the court prior to the victory for gun owners. The National Association for Gun Rights' legal arm, the National Foundation for Gun Rights, donated over $50,000 to benefit Kyle Rittenhouse. Political action committee The National Association for Gun Rights PAC (NAGR-PAC) is an affiliated political action committee registered with the Federal Election Commission. Founded in 2010, it endorsed and donated to several candidates for federal office, including Paul Broun (R-GA), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Sharron Angle, Ken Buck, and Rand Paul (R-KY). In the 2012 election cycle, NAGR-PAC endorsed Richard Mourdock, who defeated Dick Lugar for the Republican U.S. Senate nomination in Indiana, with an initial contribution of $4,500 to his campaign; Steve Daines, who ran a successful campaign for Montana's at-large seat in the U.S. House of Representatives; and Steve Stockman who ran a successful campaign for Texas's 36th congressional district. NAGR-PAC spent $83,312 in election-related expenses during the 2012 election cycle. NAGR hired its first federal lobbyist in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that occurred in December 2012. In the 2014 election cycle, NAGR's endorsements included Chris McDaniel (R-MS), Scott Renfroe (R-CO), Joe Miller (R-AK) and Mike Turner (R-OH). NAGR sent out mailers in the 2016 Texas state legislative primary season that \\"walked a fine line under new and still untested state ethics law\\", according to the Houston Chronicle. Reception In August 2013, National Association for Gun Rights and Dudley Brown were profiled in a 5280 magazine story. According to the article, Brown \\"savagely and routinely attacks candidates and officeholders unwilling to pledge, in writing, their absolute loyalty to Brown on Second Amendment issues\\". NAGR was described as a \\"fund-raising machine that bullies anyone who compromises Brown's pro-gun, anti-abortion, anti-gay agenda.\\" Former Colorado Republican State Representative B.J.

Paiyo was born in Mt Hagen, the second youngest, and only son, in a family of five sisters. The family moved from Mt Hagen to Wabag, where the family originated from and where Paiyo's football career began. Playing Career Paiyo began playing for local Wabag rugby league team, Tarakum, at the age of 14. He quickly demonstrated a natural flair for the game, being selected for the Enga Mioks representative team at the age of 15 with just a single season of playing rugby league under his belt. He was chosen for the Highlands Zone that same year but was ruled out of representative selection for being too young. Paiyo had made an impression, with the Maganis in Port Moresby inviting him to play for them. Paiyo went on to play for Tarangau as the five-eight from 1991 to 1995 while he was training to become a Prison Officer with PNG Correctional Services in Port Moresby. During that period he became a regular starter in the Port Moresby Vipers as the half/hooker in the SP Intercity Cup competition. He featured in the Vipers 1992 Premiership win and in 1993 the team finished as Runners-Up. Paiyo completed the match after suffering severe concussion mid-way through the first half. In 1993 he was selected to represent PNG in a game against the Fiji Batis in Port Moresby. Paiyo was the Vice-Captain. PNG won 35-24. Paiyo was named in the two-match test series against New Zealand in 1994 but was unable to take part as he was on a six-month national emergency deployment with 15 of his fellow Correctional Services officers and other police and defence force personnel, due to the eruption of two volcanos on the island of Rabaul. The explosion was so severe it caused the Rabaul township to be temporarily abandoned and moved to Kokopo. 5 people lost their lives in the eruption. After completing his deployment, Paiyo returned to the Port Moresby Vipers. After another sensational season, Paiyo was named in the 1995 World Cup side and at a dinner for the World Cup squad, Paiyo was awarded the Sir James Jacob National Player of the Year medal. Elias Paiyo's first Rugby League International Federation sanctioned PNG representative game was on 10 October 1995 against Tonga in Hull. The team included Bruce Mamando, David Westley, Marcus Bai, John Okul and Stanley Gene. Elias Paiyo (PNG Kumul Representative Player No.171) set a record number of points by a PNG player in World Cup match during that game. That record stood for an incredible 22 years until it was broken by Rhyse Martin in 2017 in a World Cup match against Wales played in Port Moresby. After solid World Cup performances, Paiyo and fellow Kumul, Bruce Mamando was signed to the inaugural Adelaide Rams team, a new club in the Australian Super League competition. Due to legal action in the ARL/Super League war, Paiyo and Mamando were sent to Canberra Raiders. In 1996, Elias Paiyo captained the PNG team in the Super League World Nines held at Suva in Fiji. PNG finished Runners-Up in a finals match that was 10 all at full-time. New Zealand winning the match in extra time with a 24-10 victory. The three professional players, Bruce Mamando, David Westley and Paiyo, excluded themselves from receiving any of the $15,000 in prizemoney, choosing to share it amongst the rest of the team. When Paiyo finally fronted in 1997, after the Super League/ARL war, for the Adelaide Rams team he found that the Club had signed three experienced Hooker/Halves including Kerrod Walters, Steve Stone and Dean Schifilliti. Knowing he was unlikely to displace three experienced professionals, Paiyo set about forcing his way on to the team. He showed great tenacity in developing his fitness, skills, strength and agility to a point where he earned his place in the team as a centre. A position he had previously not played. He was not selected for the Kumuls in 2001 due to a selection policy excluding players from the New South Wales competition.Mamando: Selection fine, criteria unfair postcourier.com.pg, 25 September 2001 In 2003 and 2004 Paiyo played for the Sydney Bulls in the Jim Beam Cup.Rugby league teams for Roosters v Bulldogs Sydney Morning Herald, 24 September 2003[Rugby league teams for Roosters v Bulldogs League teams - finals week three] Sydney Morning Herald, 21 September 2005 He retired from playing competitive Rugby League in 2007 and now resides in the Gold Coast of Australia.Paiyo‚Äôs points for league postcourier.com.pg, 25 February 2011 Coaching Career Elias Paiyo has been the Head Coach and Committee Member, of QLD PNG Rugby League since 2013.

QLD PNG Representative players have gone on to play for PNG Kumuls, PNG Orchids, Q Cup and NSW Cup teams as well as to various QLD representative sides. Paiyo also plays a key role, along with his fellow committee members, in the hosting of the annual Kokomo Nines Rugby League carnival, hosting PNG teams from NSW, WA, QLD and PNG.

Pati√±o is equipped with medical facilities. Service history Pati√±o was ordered from Navantia on 26 December 1991 after this joint Spanish/Dutch design won over the solely Spanish AP 21 design. The vessel was laid down at Navantia's shipyard in Ferrol, Galicia and launched on 22 June 1994. Pati√±o was commissioned into the Spanish Navy on 16 June 1995. Pati√±o participated in Operation Sharp Guard, a joint mission between the Western European Union and NATO to support the trade embargo against the former Yugoslavia. In 1998, Pati√±o participated in Operation Allied Action during the Kosovo War. Pati√±o was also involved a long series of international naval exercises such as Joint Warrior and Seattle Mariner and has also sailed as part of the NATO Standing NATO Maritime Group 1 (SNMG1) and Standing NATO Maritime Group 2 (SNMG2). Operation Enduring Freedom In 2002, Pati√±o and the Spanish frigate took part in Operation Enduring Freedom. Acting on US intelligence, the Spanish ships intercepted the merchant ship So San on 9 December and boarded it after the captain refused requests to stop. Spanish marines boarded the vessel east of the Horn of Africa and discovered 15 Scud missiles and dual-use chemicals hidden beneath sacks of cement. So San had departed North Korea with the weapons bound for Yemen. After Yemeni protest over the seizure of the ship, claiming that the delivery of the weapons was legal under existing law, So San was released and completed its journey.

On 8 December 2010, Pati√±o arrived off Somalia and became the flagship of the operation under Rear Admiral Juan Rodriguez on 14 December. Her role as the flagship lasted until 21 January 2011. By the end of November 2011 the vessel returned to the Indian Ocean to take her second tour at Operation Atalanta. As a replenishment ship she supported other vessels of the operation with oil and other supplies and also escorted ships with humanitarian help to Somalia. Pirate attack In the early morning of 12 January 2012, Pati√±o was attacked by Somali pirates, apparently under the assumption that the ship was just a commercial vessel. The Spanish naval vessel fought off an attack by the pirates. Pati√±o then sent one of her helicopters to chase the attackers and captured six of them while one was reported killed. Pati√±o had been escorting a ship carrying food aid to Somalia for the World Food Programme. Canada, 2016 In 2015 the Canadian and Spanish governments concluded a deal where Pati√±o and would deploy with Canadian naval forces in the Atlantic as their replenishment vessel in 2016. This would be done primarily for training missions. Pati√±o would be made available to the Royal Canadian Navy from January to March 2016. The ship deployed with the Royal Canadian Navy beginning on 12 February 2016 for two months. The ship returned to Spain on 30 March 2016. Beginning 1 September, Pati√±o deployed with the Royal Canadian Navy for 79 days, returning to Ferrol on 18 November.

She married when she was 16, as is common among women of the tribe. Later, in 1994, she moved to the city of Mbuji-Mayi so that her children could go to school and her husband began his career as a butcher.  Genocide in the Democratic Republic of Congo  In 1994, there was an outbreak of genocide in Rwanda. On August 2, 1998 the government of the DRC ordered the genocide of the Tutsi people in the Congo. During this time the police visited Rose on multiple occasions questioning her about the location of her husband and their money. She lied, saying that her husband was not home, and had gone to buy cows for his business. In reality, he was at home and in hiding assuming the men were being taken into custody, but they would never take the women and children. She was wrong. They later heard on televised news that the president was willing to kill all Tutsis and keep their belongings and money, but, with nowhere to go, the family hid at home cloaked in darkness with no activity to give the home the appearance that it was abandoned. Rose paid friends and neighbors to make any purchases that she needed. Eventually, however, her family was found. They were carried in a truck to a prison camp on the night of September 23, 1998, along with four other Tutsi families.  Experiences in the camp  They were in the camp for sixteen months. Under the surveillance of guards, the government ordered the murder of all the men there, including Mapendo's husband. Women and children were starved, and two women and two children in her camp were murdered by the government. In the camp they had no food or health system, and everyone had lice. Children had to defecate in the cell because there was no sanitation. To save her son from being killed by a soldier she had to give a soldier her 17-year-old daughter as a sex partner.War Survivor Shares Remarkable Story Of Forgiveness. Retrieved January 17, 2012, to 22:15 pm. At this time, she was pregnant and sick. Rose gave birth to twins on the cold, unsanitary floor during a dark night at the camp with other prisoners, including seven of her children, present. With no medical attention, Rose tied the umbilical cords using the thread binding her hair and cut them with a piece of wood. In an effort to save the babies' lives, as well as show her capacity for forgiveness, she named them after two of the camp's commanders. This strategy seemed to work, as the wife of a commander visited one day to bring a piece of clothing and some bread. Also, when the orders came for the prisoners to be killed. the commander had them transferred to another prison situated in Kinshasa (capital of the DRC) as he could not be responsible for the death of his namesake. While there, the soldier who had taken her daughter visited the camp along with the son of the president, (now current presidentJoseph Kabila), who left money and gave the order not to hurt the prisoners. Within two weeks the group was dropped off at a human rights center and then transferred to American aid center. After ten days, they were transferred to a Red Cross-run protection center in Cameroon by the US government's emergency program to resettle Tutsi refugees from the Congo. Meanwhile, Nangabire, her 11-year-old daughter, was with Mapendo's father and mother-in-law in the Congo when the surrounding village was attacked. They fled to Rwanda and stayed with a family member for approximately three years before Rose sent Nangabire to stay with her parents in Kenya. In July 2000, Mapendo and her children received refugee status and moved to the United States. During this time, Rose did not know if Nangabire had survived. After a long search, Rose received word that her parents and daughter were alive. In 2007, Nangabire received refugee status and was reunited with her family in the US.

It is a Grade I listed building. Construction of the church was begun around 1200 with the chancel and the north aisle surviving from this period. It is constructed of flint with stone dressings. The roofs are of plain tiles. The nave and south aisle were reconstructed in the 19th century by R. C. Hussey. Each aisle has a centrally placed porch, the north one in use as the vestry and the south one having been reconstructed in the 19th century. The 15th-century west tower is attached to the nave at a slight angle. It is of two stages with a battlemented parapet with a gargoyle-punctuated string course at its base. A circular stair turret on the south-east corner of the tower rises above the tower's roof to form the church's highest point and is surmounted with a weathervane dated 1676. A smaller turret built into the wall on the north side of the tower is 19th-century. The arched west window in the tower is early perpendicular. The north aisle features two large perpendicular windows and a battlemented rood loft stair turret. The rebuilt south aisle has rectangular and arched perpendicular windows. The north and south transepts contain paired lancet windows on their east sides, one of which in the north transept is early 13th century. The end walls of the transepts contain large perpendicular windows. The chancel has lancet windows on the north and south sides and three plain arched windows in the east end constructed in the 19th century. Internally, the nave is divided from the aisles on each side with an arcade of four bays mostly reconstructed in the 19th century. The chancel is also arcaded on each side with for arches, the two western ones on each side giving access to the transepts. The nave and the south transept roofs are built with moulded crown posts. The rest of the roof has plain ceilings. The font has an ogee-shaped wooden cover and the south wall of the chancel contains a piscina. Two monumental brasses are set into the chancel floor dedicated to John and Dorothy Hooper (d. 1617 and 1648). The churchyard contains a war memorial and a number of Grade II listed headstones and a Grade II listed tomb. Adjacent to the church yard on the south side are the earthwork remains of a Norman ringwork fortification, a scheduled monument.

Sality was first discovered in 2003 and has advanced over the years to become a dynamic, enduring and full-featured form of malicious code. Systems infected with Sality may communicate over a peer-to-peer (P2P) network to form a botnet for the purpose of relaying spam, proxying of communications, exfiltrating sensitive data, compromising web servers and/or coordinating distributed computing tasks for the purpose of processing intensive tasks (e.g. password cracking). Since 2010, certain variants of Sality have also incorporated the use of rootkit functions as part of an ongoing evolution of the malware family. Because of its continued development and capabilities, Sality is considered to be one of the most complex and formidable forms of malware to date. Aliases The majority of Antivirus (A/V) vendors use the following naming conventions when referring to this family of malware: * Sality * SalLoad * Kookoo * SaliCode * Kukacka Malware Profile Summary Sality is a family of polymorphic file infectors, which target Windows executable files with the extensions .EXE or .SCR. Sality utilizes polymorphic and entry-point obscuring (EPO) techniques to infect files using the following methods: not changing the entry point address of the host, and replacing the original host code at the entry point of the executable with a variable stub to redirect execution to the polymorphic viral code, which has been inserted in the last section of the host file; the stub decrypts and executes a secondary region, known as the loader; finally, the loader runs in a separate thread within the infected process to eventually load the Sality payload. Sality may execute a malicious payload that deletes files with certain extensions and/or beginning with specific strings, terminates security-related processes and services, searches a user‚Äôs address book for e-mail addresses to send spam messages, and contacts a remote host. Sality may also download additional executable files to install other malware, and for the purpose of propagating pay per install applications. Sality may contain Trojan components; some variants may have the ability to steal sensitive personal or financial data (i.e. information stealers), generate and relay spam, relay traffic via HTTP proxies, infect web sites, achieve distributed computing tasks such as password cracking, as well as other capabilities. Sality‚Äôs downloader mechanism downloads and executes additional malware as listed in the URLs received using the peer-to-peer component. The distributed malware may share the same ‚Äúcode signature‚Äù as the Sality payload, which may provide attribution to one group and/or that they share a large portion of the code. The additional malware typically communicates with and reports to central command and control (C&C;) servers located throughout the world. According to Symantec, the \\"combination of file infection mechanism and the fully decentralized peer-to-peer network [...] make Sality one of the most effective and resilient malware in today's threat landscape.\\" Two versions of the botnet are currently active, versions 3 and 4. The malware circulated on those botnets are digitally signed by the attackers to prevent hostile takeover. In recent years, Sality has also included the use of rootkit techniques to maintain persistence on compromised systems and evade host-based detections, such as anti-virus software. Installation Sality infects files in the affected computer. Most variants use a DLL that is dropped once in each computer. The DLL file is written to disk in two forms, for example: * %SYSTEM%\\\\wmdrtc32.dll * %SYSTEM%\\\\wmdrtc32.dl_ The DLL file contains the bulk of the virus code. The file with the extension \\".dl_\\" is the compressed copy. Recent variants of Sality, such as Virus:Win32-Sality.AM, do not drop the DLL, but instead load it entirely in memory without writing it to disk. This variant, along with others, also drops a driver with a random file name in the folder %SYSTEM%\\\\drivers. Other malware may also drop Sality in the computer. For example, a Sality variant detected as Virus:Win32-Sality.AU is dropped by Worm:Win32-Sality.AU. Some variants of Sality, may also include a rootkit by creating a device with the name Device\\\\amsint32 or \\\\DosDevices\\\\amsint32. Method of Propagation File infection Sality usually targets all files in drive C: that have .SCR or .EXE file extensions, beginning with the root folder. Infected files increase in size by a varying amount. The virus also targets applications that run at each Windows start and frequently used applications, referenced by the following registry keys: * HKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\ShellNoRoam\\\\MUICache * HKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run * HKLM\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run Sality avoids infecting particular files, in order to remain hidden in the computer: * Files protected by System File Checker (SFC) * Files under the %SystemRoot% folder * Executables of several antivirus/firewall products by ignoring files that contain certain substrings Removable drives and network shares Some variants of Sality can infect legitimate files, which are then moved to available removable drives and network shares by enumerating all network share folders and resources of the local computer and all files in drive C: (beginning with the root folder). It infects the files it finds by adding a new code section to the host and inserting its malicious code into the newly added section. If a legitimate file exists, the malware will copy the file to the Temporary Files folder and then infect the file. The resulting infected file is then moved to the root of all available removable drives and network shares as any of the following: * \\\\.pif * \\\\.exe * \\\\.cmd The Sality variant also creates an \\"autorun.inf\\" file in the root of all these drives that points to the virus copy. When a drive is accessed from a computer supporting the AutoRun feature, the virus is then launched automatically. Some Sality variants may also drop a file with a .tmp file extension to the discovered network shares and resources as well as drop a .LNK file to run the dropped virus. Payload * Sality may inject code into running processes by installing a message hook * Sality commonly searches for and attempts to delete files related to antivirus updates and terminate security applications, such as antivirus and personal firewall programs; attempts to terminate security applications containing the same strings as the files it avoids infecting; and may also terminate security-related services and block access to security-related websites that contain certain substrings * Sality variants may modify the computer registry to lower Windows security, disable the use of the Windows Registry Editor and/or prevent the viewing of files with hidden attributes; Some Sality variants recursively delete all registry values and data under the registry subkeys for HKCU\\\\System\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\SafeBoot and HKLM\\\\System\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\SafeBoot to prevent the user from starting Windows in safe mode * Some Sality variants can steal sensitive information such as cached passwords and logged keystrokes, which were entered on the affected computer * Sality variants usually attempt to download and execute other files including pay per install executables using a preconfigured list of up to 1000 peers; the goal of the P2P network is to exchange lists of URLs to feed to the downloader functionality; the files are downloaded into the Windows Temporary Files folder and decrypted using one of several hardcoded passwords * Most of Sality‚Äôs payload is executed in the context of other processes, which makes cleaning difficult and allows the malware to bypass some firewalls; to avoid multiple injections in the same process, a system-wide mutex called \\".exeM__\\" is created for every process in which code is injected, which would prevent more than one instance from running in memory at the same time. * Some variants of Win32-Sality drop a driver with a random file name in the folder %SYSTEM%\\\\drivers to perform similar functions such as terminate security-related processes and block access to security-related websites, and may also disable any system service descriptor table (SSDT) hooks to prevent certain security software from working properly * Some Sality variants spread by moving to available removable/remote drives and network shares * Some Sality variants drop .LNK files, which automatically run the dropped virus * Some Sality variants may search a user's Outlook address book and Internet Explorer cached files for e-mail addresses to send spam messages, which then sends out spammed messages based on information it retrieves from a remote server * Sality may add a section to the configuration file %SystemRoot%\\\\system.ini as an infection marker, contact remote hosts to confirm Internet connectivity, report a new infection to its author, receive configuration or other data, download and execute arbitrary files (including updates or additional malware), receive instruction from a remote attacker, and/or upload data taken from the affected computer; some Sality Variants may open a remote connection, allowing a remote attacker to download and execute arbitrary files on the infected computer * Computers infected with recent versions of Sality, such as Virus:Win32-Sality.AT, and Virus:Win32-Sality.AU, connect to other infected computers by joining a peer-to-peer (P2P) network to receive URLs pointing to additional malware components; the P2P protocol runs over UDP, all the messages exchanged on the P2P network are encrypted, and the local UDP port number used to connect to the network is generated as a function of the computer name * Sality may add a rootkit that includes a driver with capabilities such as terminating processes via NtTerminateProcess as well as blocking access to select anti-virus resources (e.g. anti-virus vendor web sites) by way of IP Filtering; the latter requires the driver to register a callback function, which will be used to determine if packets should be dropped or forwarded (e.g. drop packets if string contains the name of an anti-virus vendor from a comprised list) Recovery Microsoft has identified dozens of files which are all commonly associated with the malware. Sality uses stealth measures to maintain persistence on a system; thus, users may need to boot to a trusted environment in order to remove it. Sality may also make configuration changes such as to the Windows Registry, which makes it difficult to download, install and/or update virus protection. Also, since many variants of Sality attempt to propagate to available removable/remote drives and network shares, it is important to ensure the recovery process thoroughly detects and removes the malware from any and all known/possible locations.

They regularly did this during Australia's colonial era. An example of one such competition took played in Yandilla, Queensland, in 1878. Women's archery was established in Victoria by the 1870s, with the sport most often being played at archery clubs. At the time, the sport was viewed as a royal one. Early Australian archers from this era included Roma Bowen. The sport was encouraged because it didn't require women to give up their womanhood in order to compete. Women were members of an archery club in Adelaide by 1870. Archery became part of the women's physical education curriculum during the 1880s. The largest area to adopt this sport in the curriculum was in Victoria at schools like MLC Kew, which borrowed heavily from a British sporting tradition. In 1932, the Australian branch National Council of the YWCA sent questionnaires to individual branches asking the branches what sports they preferred to participate in. Archery was one of the sports women indicated interest in. The Adelaide branch cited archery and said participation in this and other sports taught girls loyalty, \\"fair play, co- operation, friendliness, unselfishness, self-control and doggedness.\\" At the 1982 Commonwealth Games held in Brisbane, new women's sports were included on the programming including archery and lawn bowls. Elisa Barnard competed at the London 2012 Olympic Games, one of two archers to representing Australia.Australian archery, 2012 London Olympics Australian women have been awarded scholarships for archery at the Australian Institute of Sport. They include Jade Beatty who held a scholarship from 2001 to 2002, Deonne Bridger who held a scholarship from 1997 to 2000 and Mary Chidlow who held a scholarship in 1998.

Although the body of his work includes traditional, post modern and classic architectural styles, he is best known for his modern buildings, many being borderline brutalism. Early life Born in Coronado, California, on April 24, 1943, he was the son of Hope King Reese and Wilbur Roy Reese. The Reese family moved to Williamsburg, Virginia, when he was seven, and he attended James Blair High School before enrolling in the University of Virginia as an undergraduate. From 1966 to 1968, he served in the U.S. Navy on a search and rescue ship off the coast of Vietnam. Upon completion of his military service, he returned to school and graduated with bachelor's degree in architecture in 1971. After receiving his professional certification in 1973, Bill spent several years working for architecture firms in the Charlottesville and Newport News area before relocating to La Jolla, California, in 1977. He practiced architecture in the San Diego area until 1982. Reese believed the work of architect Rudolph Schindler to be of great importance and considered Schindler's contribution to the world of architecture to be monumental. He found in him a kindred spirit and was inspired by the freedom and simplicity of his designs. Reese lived in one of Schindler's homes in the Pueblo Ribera complex in La Jolla, California in the early 1980s. The impact of Schindler's simplistic architectural style can be seen in many of Reese's designs, including the North Haven, New York home for which Reese was featured by Metropolitan Home magazine as one of the top 100 architects to have been published by the magazine. Later professional career In 1982, Reese headed east to join his long-time friend and colleague Kirby Grimes and set up an office in Bridgehampton. He remained on the East End until 2006, when he returned to California and opened an office in La Jolla. Projects and awards Over the years, Reese designed more than 225 projects, including single family residences, high-rise and low- rise apartment buildings and various commercial projects. His work was featured in numerous publications, including, among others, Home, House & Garden, Woman's Day, Glamour, and Metropolitan Home, in which his home in Shinnecock Hills was featured on the cover and chosen as House of the Year. In 1993 The New York Times featured Reese's 6000 sq ft eco-house at Water Mill, Long Island. The house used off-the-shelf materials, and environmental features including a tall ventilation tower and a large concrete slab to provide radiant heat. He was also the recipient of several design awards, including two from the American Institute of Architects. Death He died of cancer in 2011 in La Jolla, California.

The definition of the thickness of the diffusion layer is arbitrary because the concentration approaches asymptotically the value in the bulk solution\\". The diffusion layer thus depends on the diffusion coefficient (D) of the analyte and for voltammetric measurements on the scan rate (V/s). It is usually considered to be some multiple of (Dt)1/2 (where 1/t = scan rate). At slow scan rates, the diffusion layer is large, on the order of micrometers, whereas at fast scan rates the diffusion layer is nanometers in thickness.

Blondie's husband, Dagwood, isn't happy with coming home every night finding a note saying that his wife is at a meeting with the housewives. And her son, Baby, is left on his own all the time. The family dog, Daisy, roams freely around the house with no one to look after it. The household is falling apart, and the same goes for all the other households in the neighborhood. The other husbands are experiencing very similar situations. they blame Blondie for all this, since she is the one who started the Housewives of America.

He gets desperate to get his uniform back right away and sets out in search of Dagwood. Herschel arrives at the Housewives of America camp just as Blondie is about to renounce her membership in the group. Following behind him are Dithers and two M.P.s, who are looking for their AWOL soldier. The M.P.s mistake Dagwood for their lost soldier and begin to chase him, as he runs for the woods and up the mountainside. Running toward the dam, Dagwood catches sight of a little suspicious looking man, climbing up the dam with a parcel under his arm. Dagwood assumes the parcel contains a bomb, and that the man is about to blow up the dam. He starts chasing the man to stop the sabotage, forgetting about his own predicament for a moment. He catches up and struggles with the man for control over the parcel. Just when he gains control over the package, Blondie, Dithers and the two soldiers arrive at the scene. When they open the package, it turns out it only contained some rationed sugar that the man tried to stow away. However, the soldiers are so impressed by Dagwood's heroics that they forgive him his unlawful wearing of a military uniform. Dagwood returns to his home with his wife and isn't bothered anymore by the Housewives of America.

The video was widely viewed on YouTube, TMZ and other sites, and caused anger and outrage in Afghanistan and the Middle East. Content of the video The video shows four men dressed in full U.S. Marine combat gear laughing and joking as they urinate on what appear to be dead men somewhere in a rural part of Afghanistan. News sources describe the dead men as Taliban insurgents. There is a wheelbarrow next to them and the scene appears as rural farming area. One of the bodies is covered in blood and the Marine can be heard joking \\"Have a great day, buddy\\", \\"Golden like a shower\\" and \\"Yeahhhh!\\"  Circumstances  Subsequent investigation would reveal that the incident took place around July 27, 2011 during a counter-insurgency operation near Sandala, Musa Qala District in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, a Taliban stronghold and a center of opium poppy production that was the scene of tough fighting at the time. The urinating Marines were from the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marines based at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. Of the roughly 1,000 Marines in the battalion, seven were killed during the unit's seven- month deployment in the area. Investigation, perpetrators, and punishment  Within a day of the video's release, internal and criminal investigations were initiated by the Marine Corps. Marine Corps Commandant Gen. James F. Amos assigned LtGen Steven A. Hummer to conduct an internal investigation. Additionally, Gen. Amos directed the Naval Criminal Investigation Service to conduct a criminal investigation. Desecrating bodies is a crime under U.S. military law and the Geneva Conventions. ISAF spokesman Col. Gary Kolb told CNN, \\"In extreme cases, an act such as urinating on a body could be construed as a war crime.\\" Initially, Gen. Amos designated Lt. Gen Thomas Waldhauser, the highest ranking Marine in Afghanistan, to receive the reports and decide on discipline and punishment. However, in the beginning of February, Amos met Waldhauser in the United Arab Emirates, and they discussed the case. Amos expressed his desire for the Marines involved to be punished harshly. These conversations created the issue of unlawful command influence: it now appeared that Waldhauser was being pressured by his superior rather than sitting as an impartial judge. In an attempt to correct his mistake, Gen Amos replaced Waldhauser with Lt. Gen. Richard P. Mills. However, the issue of unlawful command influence would continue to dog the investigation. On August 27, 2012 the U.S. Marine Corps announced that three Marines involved in the incident received non-judicial administrative punishments. They will also receive a permanent mark on their records that will impact any future promotions and re- enlistments. A press release from Lt. Gen Mills' headquarters stated: \\"We hold Marines to a high standard of ethical behavior. The Marine Corps takes misconduct by Marines very seriously and is committed to holding accountable those who are responsible.\\" The press release also indicated that \\"disciplinary actions against other Marines involved in the incident will be announced at a later date.\\" Two U.S. Marines‚ÄîStaff Sergeants Joseph W. Chamblin and Edward W. Deptola‚Äîhave been charged in the middle of September 2012 for \\"violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice\\" for their involvement in the urination incident. The two staff sergeants were officially charged with \\"posing for unofficial photographs with human casualties,\\" failing to properly prevent or report misconduct by junior Marines under their command, the indiscriminate firing of a grenade launcher and the indiscriminate firing of an enemy machine gun. Lt. Gen. Mills referred both staff sergeants to a Special Court Martial. Referring their cases to a Special Court Martial skips the evidentiary hearings needed to proceed to a General Court Martial and also limits their potential punishments. The maximum punishments available under a Special Court Martial is one year of confinement, a two-thirds forfeiture of pay for one year, a reduction in rank to Private and a bad conduct discharge. Chamblin has published his view of the events in a book. Reactions Afghan President Hamid Karzai said that \\"the government of Afghanistan is deeply disturbed by a video that shows American soldiers desecrating dead bodies of three Afghans.\\" Arsala Rahmani, a leading negotiator in Karzai's peace council said that the film will have a \\"very, very bad impact on peace efforts\\" and that \\"Looking at such action, the Taliban can easily recruit young people and tell them that their country has been attacked by Christians and Jews and they must defend it.\\" U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said \\"I have seen the footage, and I find the behavior depicted in it utterly deplorable.\\" Congressman Allen West said, \\"The Marines were wrong. Give them a maximum punishment under field grade level Article 15 (non-judicial punishment), place a General Officer level letter of reprimand in their personnel file, and have them in full dress uniform stand before their Battalion, each personally apologize to God, Country, and Corps videotaped and conclude by singing the full US Marine Corps Hymn without a teleprompter. As for everyone else, unless you have been shot at by the Taliban, shut your mouth, war is hell.\\" Dana Loesch said in her The Dana Show on KFTK, a conservative radio station, \\"Can someone explain to me if there's supposed to be a scandal that someone pees on the corpse of a Taliban fighter? Someone who, as part of an organization, murdered over 3,000 Americans? I'd drop trou and do it too. That's me though. I want a million cool points for these guys. Is that harsh to say? Come on people this is a war. What do people think this is. I am totally not politically correct. I told you this. They think that we are going to sit down and have tea.\\" She added \\"Do I have a problem with that as a citizen of the United States? No, I don't.\\" Goldie Taylor, a former Marine responded to Loesch's remarks, \\"disgusting,‚Äù adding ‚Äúto say you would ‚Äòdrop trou‚Äô and do the same thing, I question someone‚Äôs integrity who would say something like that.\\" A Taliban spokesman said: \\"First they killed the Afghans with mortars, and they then urinated on their bodies. We strongly condemn this inhumane action by the wild American soldiers.\\" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she believed the men may be guilty of a war crime. Effects of the video The video caused outrage in Afghanistan, the Middle East and across the world. An Afghan soldier who shot dead four French troops in Afghanistan and wounded another eight seriously said that he did it because of the American soldiers who urinated on bodies in the video. The released video eroded, along with the burning of the Muslim holy book Quran by US troops and Panjwai shooting spree, relations between the United States and Afghanistan, has seriously damaged the image of American soldiers before the Afghan public, and was according to the Taliban one of their reasons for their April 2012 Afghanistan attacks.

Giulietta Sprint Speciale Tipo 750 SS \\"Low nose\\" Giulietta Sprint Speciale. The first prototype of the Giulietta SS was presented in 1957 at the Turin Motor Show. After two more prototypes were presented in car shows, the official presentation of the production version for the press was on 24 June 1959 on the Monza race track. The first 101 cars produced had \\"low nose\\" and 750 SS designation. 100 cars minimum were needed to homologate a car in FIA regulations. While there were some all-aluminium cars produced, the majority of these cars had steel bodies with aluminium doors, engine bonnet and boot lid. Also first cars were equipped with Weber 40 DCO3 carburettors, later changed to 40 DCOE2. The drag coefficient of the Sprint Speciale is 0.28, the same as a Chevrolet Corvette (C6), and was not surpassed for more than twenty years. Cars used the 1,290 cc Alfa Romeo Twin Cam engine, a design with hemispheric combustion chambers and valves controlled directly by twin overhead camshafts. Tipo 101.20 Dashboard of a 1961 Giulietta Sprint Speciale. Small changes to a production version included steel doors, Weber 40 DCOE2 carburetors, higher front nose, removal of plexiglas windows. Bumpers were fitted front and rear, also cars had some minimal sound-proofing. With the 1290 cc engine and of power the maximum speed was around . The 1.3 litre engine and gearbox was the same as used in race-oriented Giulietta Sprint Zagato. All Giuliettas SS had three- shoe drum brakes at front wheels and drum brakes at the rear. Export versions had 101.17 designation. Side badges had \\"Giulietta Sprint Speciale\\" script. Giulia Sprint Speciale Giulia Sprint Speciale Bertone Prototipo There was a prototype by Bertone of a replacement for Giulietta SS, named \\"Giulia SS Bertone Prototipo\\", but the new shape did not enter production and the next generation Giulia SS carried over an unchanged Giulietta SS body. The car was designed in 1965 by Giorgetto Giugiaro during the end of his stay at Bertone.

The bigger engine 1.6 L Giulia series replaced the Giulietta and was introduced at the March 1963 Geneva Motor Show. As Giulietta is the diminutive for Giulia in Italian, the new Giulia name was a wordplay hinting that the new car was a grown-up version of the Giulietta. In spite of a Giulia SS prototype, Alfa Romeo decided to retain the Giulietta- shaped SS in production. The 1,570cc engine made up to possible. The 1,570cc engine with Weber 40 DCOE2 carburetors was taken from Giulia Sprint Veloce and delivered of power. Most Giulia SS had disc brakes at front wheels. An easy way to distinguish the Giulia SS from the Giulietta SS is by the dashboard. The Giulia has a leather underside with the glovebox at a different angle than the main fascia. The dashboard in the Giulietta is sloping and painted in one colour without a leather underside. Side badges carried \\"Giulia SS\\" scripts. Production ended in 1965, with a last single Sprint Speciale completed in 1966. 1,366 Giulietta Sprint Speciale and 1,400 Giulia Sprint Speciale were produced. 25 cars were converted to right hand drive by RuddSpeed.

Originally from New Zealand, McFayden's artistic career has taken him across the world, first as a resident in London's Fabric Nightclub, to multiple tours in Europe and Australia. He currently resides in the United States, where he has become a fixture amongst North American art and music festivals, most notably Burning Man. Background Born in Fiji, McFayden spent his childhood in New Zealand, where his appreciation for music began at an early age. He credits his parents for his introduction to many different genres, most notably blues, jazz, and Polynesian styles of music. He also acknowledges to being an ardent fan of The Beatles during his adolescence. While in school he learned how to play guitar and drums, which he played in various bands. Soon after his early exposure to writing music, he began to DJ and produce his own style of electronic music, drawing upon the influences of artists such as Funkadelic, Billy Boyo and the Greensleeves, and Public Enemy. Aside from his pursuits as a musician, McFayden has also been a longtime practitioner of yoga and Buddhism. Having practiced yoga since 1999 with the Satyananda lineage in London, he has also studied yoga and Buddhism with Buddhist monk and Professor of Comparative Religion Venerable Sumati Marut since 2007. McFayden was married to Gabriela Valentina Ocampo on 15 December 2018. Production career FreQ Nasty has widely been considered a pioneer in breakbeat music since the genre's initial rise in popularity. FreQ Nasty began his career in 1998 on the UK label Botchit & Scarper, where he forged his sound of ragga, hip-hop, dancehall, and heavy basslines at the apex London's 1990s dance music revolution. Of his early releases, the singles \\"Boomin Back Atcha\\" and \\"Move Back\\" quickly became classics within the breaks genre. In 2003, he moved to Skint Records, where he went on to release a list of top records, collaborating with and remixing a diverse range of artists including Fatboy Slim, Kelis, KRS-One, Roots Manuva, Rodney P, Bassnectar, Tipper, and reggae legend Junior Delgado. 2008 saw the release of \\"Creator\\", his crossover hit collaboration with Santigold, producer Switch and New York City lyricist Santogold, and the Fabric Live 42 mix CD, which was picked as DJ Magazine's compilation of the month. In early 2011 he released \\"Dread at the Controls\\" under California label Muti Music, which subsequently launched the seventeen-city \\"Monsters of Bass\\" tour. In that following December, FreQ's \\"Low FreQuency Pureland EP\\" was released, earning DJ Magazine's selection as the MoneyShot release for December, receiving a 10 out of 10 rating. Activism and side projects Alongside his career as an established music producer, FreQ Nasty is also known for his engagement as a social activist. In early 2008, he launched Giveback.net, a socially conscious website in which musicians donate music in support of non-profit \\"action campaigns\\" via music campaigns featured on the site. The first campaign, in support of the Tibetan People's Uprising Movement, featured a collaboration with Bassnectar on the single \\"Viva Tibet\\". FreQ Nasty has been a vocal advocate for musicians reaching out to support social issues, to which he is quoted: FreQ Nasty also collaborated with San Francisco-based Heavyweight Dub Champion, remixing the group's \\"Snared\\" single in support of The World Family's creation of an irrigation system in the village of Gara Dima, Ethiopia. A similar collaboration was completed with singer-songwriter Michael Franti, in which Franti's single \\"The Future\\" was remixed in support of a Bay Area nonprofit to help create a music studio for at-risk youth in San Francisco's Bayview- Hunters Point district. FreQ's current side projects include the Dub Kirtan All Stars, a live 10 piece band of singers and musicians formed with producer David Starfire, and The Yoga of Bass, a series of talks given with yoga teacher Claire Thompson, both of which seek to open up the Yoga tradition to underground dance music club audiences.

He was born at Pula in the Istrian region of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and held the title of Baron. His father, August, Freiherr von Bucovich (1852‚Äì1913), was a former Corvette Captain in the Austro-Hungarian navy and later an entrepreneur in the railroad concession sector. His mother was Greek. He is believed to have been married four times. The Berliner Morgenpost in 2009 described him as \\"one of the great unknown photographers of 20th Century European photography\\". Early Life He began studying mathematics and mechanics at the Eidgen√∂ssischen Technischen Hochschule in Zurich in 1904. He continued these studies in Nancy, France. From 1908 to 1909 he studied electrical engineering and mechanical engineering at the Technikum Mittweida in Saxony. Bucovich began his professional career in 1909 at the Otis Elevator Company in New York City, USA, which sent him to the Russian capital St. Petersburg in 1911. There he also dealt with the profitable sale of agricultural machinery. In 1913, he acceded to his title as Baron upon his father's death. In 1914 he was deported to Siberia as an enemy foreigner, but was able to flee and return to St. Petersburg. From 1918 he dedicated himself to the repatriation of the deportees who remained in Siberia, which was very difficult due to the civil war in Russia. Career in Germany He worked primarily in Germany in the 1920s and 30s, as well as traveled to France and England. Bucovich was active in the art and antiques trade and settled in Berlin, where he took over the photo studio of Karl Schenker in 1925. Between 1926 and 1930, von Bucovich (and his wife, Marie, also a photographer) ran their studio from Budapester Stra√üe 6, in Berlin's Tiergarten district. In his published work he was most noted for his urban studies with a focus on streetscapes, but his studio work undertaken at the Atelier Karl Schenker was often of entertainment personalities of Weimar period stage and screen. He photographed Marlene Dietrich, Elisabeth Bergner and Leni Riefenstahl (in her days as a dancer, preceding her career as a film director). Amongst his most notable books were Berlin, Das Gesicht Der Stadt (Berlin, Portrait of a City) and Paris (with a foreword by Paul Morand). The Paris book included photos by Germaine Krull. The Berlin book published originally by Albertus Verlag, a publishing house he founded in 1928, had a foreword written by the author Alfred D√∂blin. During the late 1920s his photos appeared across the gamut of German photo journalism including the titles: Der Querschnitt, Uhu, Die Dame, Die neue Linie, Das Magazin, Skizzen, Welt- Magazin, K√∂lnische Illustrierte Zeitung, Revue des Monats, Das Kriminalmagazin, Das Leben, Das Kunstblatt, Farbe und Form, Das Deutsche Lichtbild, Deutscher Kamera Almanach, Die Reklame, Der Photo-Freund. His views of Girona in Spain taken in 1933 were published in the National Geographic magazine. Exile Years He moved to New York during the 1930s where he has a studio at 687 Lexington Avenue and worked for a publishing house on 41st Street. In his American period he published two photographic essays, Washington D.C. City Beautiful and Manhattan Magic: A Collection of Eighty- Five Photographs. He moved to Mexico and was working there through at least the early part of that decade, until his death on 30 November 1947 in a traffic accident in Mexico City. Exhibitions His work was shown at major photography salons of the day. He was represented at probably the most important German photography exhibition of the Bauhaus period, Fotografie der Gegenwart (Contemporary photography) in Magdeburg in 1929. He was also shown at the Fourth International Exhibition of Pictorial Photography at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor, the Third International Exhibition of Pictorial Photography Seattle Camera Club, and the 15th and 16th Annual Pittsburgh Salon of Photographic Art at the Carnegie Institute. His work is in the collections of the New Orleans Museum of Art, the National Museum of Mexican Art and the National Gallery of Canada.  Publications  * Berlin. (= Das Gesicht der St√§dte).

Several fragments are extant. The plot told of Odysseus' death, accidentally killed by his son Telegonus. Some scholars believe that another Sophocles title, Niptra (ŒùŒπœÄœÑœÅŒ±, \\"The Footwashing\\", \\"The Washing\\"), is the same play as Odysseus Acanthoplex. Dana Sutton, however, disputes this, suggesting that Niptra was a separate play dealing with Odysseus' return to Ithaca but not with his death. Plot The plot of Odysseus Acanthoplex was based on Telegony, which was part of the Epic Cycle. As background to the plot of the play, Homer's Odyssey tells of Odysseus spending a year with the goddess Circe. In the version of the myth that Odysseus Acanthoplex was based on, Odysseus and Circe had a son from this dalliance, Telegonus. From what we know of the plot of the play, Telegonus arrived at Ithaca to reveal himself to his father. However, a fight ensued and Telegonus killed Odysseus without knowing who Odysseus was. In the myth, Telegonus used a spear that had a venomous stingray spine to kill Odysseus. The plot also dealt with the subsequent marriages between Telegonus and Odysseus' wife Penelope and between Circe and Odysseus' son by Penelope, Telemachus. Two of the extant fragments from the play refer to the oar Odysseus carried to appease the sea god Poseidon. Several extant fragments make reference to the oracle of Zeus at Dodona. Other than one reference in Trachiniae, these are the only extant references to Dodona in Sophocles' works. Classicist T.F. Hoey believes that the thematic development of Odysseus Acanthoplex was similar to that of Trachiniae. According to archaeologist Thomas B. L. Webster, the plot of Odysseus Acanthoplex had a diptych form, i.e., in two parts, analogous to Sophocles' extant Ajax, Trachiniae and Antigone. Sutton speculated that the play partially unfolded as follows. Early in the play, Odysseus related the directions from Teiresias described in The Odyssey in which he was supposed to carry an oar far inland as a sacrifice to Poseidon. He also related an oracle he received at Dodona telling him that he would be killed by his son. Believing that the oracle referred to Telemachus, he would have taken precautions against Telemachus killing him, but was unprepared when another son who he did not know of arrived and a fight ensued. The wounded Odysseus was brought on stage lamenting his wounds and denouncing the oracle for failing to predict that he would die at the hands of this stranger. Then Telegonus arrived on stage, and a recognition scene occurred in which Telegonus discovered that he killed his father and Odysseus realized that the oracle had come to pass. Webster, who believes that Niptra and Odysseus Acanthoplex are the same play, believes that the play began with Odysseus' return home to Ithaca and his recognition by Eurycleia, who in The Odyssey washed Odysseus' feet. Critical reception In his Poetics, Aristotle used the plot of Odysseus Acanthoplex, under the title Odysseus Wounded, as one of three examples of an effective type of plot for tragedy in which a character performs a horrific deed to a relative in ignorance and only learns the truth after the fact. The other examples Aristotle gave of this type of effective plot were Sophocles' Oedipus Rex and a play about Alcmaeon by 4th century BCE tragic playwright Astydamas. Roman philosopher CiceroCicero, Tusculanae disputationes 2.21.49 praised Pacuvius' play Niptra, which was an imitation of Sophocles' Odysseus Acanthoplex, because in Pacuvius' play Odysseus does not lament his wounds excessively, as Cicero believed the character did in Sophocles' play. Date In The Lost Sophocles, D. F. Sutton suggests that Odysseus Acanthoplex was possibly first produced by about 414 BCE, which Sutton suggests is the same timeframe as Sophocles' Electra. Webster believes it was produced at a date close to that of Women of Trachis, which he dates to sometime before 431, due to perceived similarities with the structure of that play.

Discovered in 1981 but not scientifically described until 2011, the fly is named after American recording artist and actress Beyonc√©. Description Scaptia beyonceae has a striking golden tip to its abdomen, formed by a dense patch of golden hairs, providing the inspiration for its name. Part of the Plinthina subgenus, S. beyonceae was first collected in 1981, along with two other previously unknown subgenus specimens; the fly was officially described in 2011 by CSIRO research scientist Bryan Lessard. According to Lessard, although usually considered by humans to be pests, many types of horse fly serve an important role in the pollination of plants. The flies drink nectar from several types of grevilleas, tea trees and eucalypts. Other than the 1981 specimen, the fly has only been collected on two other occasions. All three collected specimens are female. Naming The naming of animal species is required to comply with guidelines established by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN). The ICZN's guidelines allow for species to receive names that honour people, including celebrities. Other species named after famous people include Hyla stingi, a frog named after the singer Sting; Pachygnatha zappa, a spider named after singer-songwriter Frank Zappa; and three beetle species from the Agathidium genus (A. bushi, A. cheneyi and A. rumsfeldi) named after American politicians George W.

In a career that lasted from July 1847 to October 1849 he ran thirteen times and won nine races. He was the leading colt of his generation in England at both two and three years old, with his wins including The Derby and the St Leger in 1848: he was the first horse for forty-eight years to win both of these Classics. His later career was less successful and he was retired to stud in 1850. Surplice had limited success as a sire of winners and died in 1871. Background Surplice was a dark bay horse with a small white star standing 16.1 hands high, making him an unusually large Thoroughbred for his time. He was bred by Lord George Bentinck, the dominant figure in British horse-racing of his era. In 1846, Bentinck decided to concentrate on his political affairs and sold all his racing interests, including the yearling Surplice, to Edward Lloyd-Mostyn for ¬£10,000. A condition of the deal was that Surplice should remain with his trainer John Kent at Goodwood. Later that year Mostyn sold Surplice to Lord Clifden. Surplice's sire, Touchstone, won the St Leger and two Ascot Gold Cups, before going on to be an outstandingly successful stallion. Apart from Surplice, his classic winners included Cotherstone, Orlando and Newminster and he was Champion sire on four occasions. Surplice's dam, Crucifix, was an undefeated racemare who won the 1000 Guineas, 2000 Guineas and Epsom Oaks in 1840. Racing career 1847: two-year-old season Surplice began his racing career in July 1847 at Goodwood when he ran in the Ham Stakes. He was made the 4/7 favourite and the result was never in doubt as he led from the start and won easily by two lengths from Liston. Immediately after the race the bookmakers offered odds of only 10/1 against him for the following year's Epsom Derby. He followed up in the Produce Stakes at the same meeting, starting at odds of 1/3 and winning by three lengths in a race which was described as \\"all one way\\". In September he was sent to Doncaster, where he won the Municipal Stakes. At Newmarket in October, he was allowed a walkover in the Buckenham Stakes, when no horse appeared to oppose him. His earnings of ¬£5,550 were the highest for any British two-year-old that season and his performances were sufficient to send him into the winter break regarded as the leading contender for the following year's Derby. 1848: three-year-old season Lord George Bentinck: his sale of Surplice cost him the \\"Blue Ribbon\\". Surplice maintained his position as Derby favourite in early 1848, despite a series of negative rumours which seemed to originate from Lord Clifden's racing manager, Francis Villiers who had a strong financial interest in his stable companion, Loadstone. Surplice made his first appearance of the season in the Derby at Epsom. He started the even-money favourite in a field of seventeen runners. Ridden by Sim Templeman, he was settled in fifth place before moving up to turn into the straight in third place. Two furlongs from the finish Templeman sent Surplice into the lead, where he looked to be going well, but was soon challenged by Shylock. Surplice successfully turned back the challenge but had to be ridden hard to hold the late run of Springy Jack and win by a neck. After the race Benjamin Disraeli was attempting to console Lord George Bentinck who was downhearted at having sold the horse who had won the Derby. When Bentinck told Disraeli that a man not involved in racing could not possibly understand the significance of the race Disraeli replied that he knew perfectly well that the Derby was \\"the Blue Ribbon of the Turf\\". At Goodwood in July, Surplice ran twice but appeared to be completely unsuited by the soft ground and was beaten in both his races. On the Tuesday of the meeting he finished second to Distaffina in the Gratwicke Stakes over one and a half miles and two days later he finished third to Glendower in the one mile Racing Stakes. Surplice had been odds-on favourite for both races. He was then transferred to the stable of Robert Stephenson. At Doncaster in September he started at odds 9/4 in a nine-runner field for the St Leger, with the filly Canezou starting favourite. The race was delayed by a badly managed false start, which resulted in most of the runners racing for almost a furlong before being successfully recalled. Ridden by Nat Flatman, a late replacement for Jem Robinson, Surplice raced prominently and moved up to challenge the leader Flatcatcher early in the straight. He briefly took the lead, only to be headed by Canezou, but Flatman rode a strong finish and Surplice regained the lead in the closing stages to win by a neck. The finish was described as being a \\"most exciting\\" one, although it was noted that, as at Epsom, Surplice was given an extremely hard race, with Flatman making liberal use of his whip and spurs, and after the race he was reported to be in a \\"distressed\\" condition. He was the first Derby winner to take the St Leger since Champion in 1800. Two days after his win in the St Leger, Surplice walked over in the North of England Stakes. On 26 September, Surplice appeared at Newmarket and won the ten furlong Grand Duke Michael Stakes from Flatcatcher. As a result of his strong autumn form, Surplice was made 3/1 favourite for the Cesarewitch Handicap two weeks later, despite the unfavourably soft ground, but finished unplaced behind The Cur. Surplice was entered for two other races at Newmarket in the autumn of 1848, but his entries for these races were rendered void by the death of in September of his breeder Lord George Bentinck who had made the original nominations. Surplice's earnings for the 1848 season totaled ¬£10,475, the highest for any British horse for five years. 1849: four-year-old season Surplice's first run as a four-year-old was intended to be a match race at Newmarket in April in which he was scheduled to concede 35 pounds to Lord Exeter's filly Tophana, but he failed to appear and his owner paid a forfeit. His first actual appearance was delayed until 3 August when he finished sixth when 6/4 favourite for the Chesterfield Cup at Goodwood. In autumn there were reports of a \\"great match race\\" to be run between Surplice, Van Tromp and Justice for Ireland at Newmarket in October. The \\"match\\" never came to fruition, as Surplice's two rivals were withdrawn and he walked over for the ¬£1,000 prize. Later that month he failed to appear for a match race at Newmarket in which he was set to receive sixteen pounds from the six-year-old Royal Hunt Cup winner Collingwood. 1850: five-year-old season Surplice made one recorded appearance as a five-year-old in 1850. At Newmarket on 29 April he was \\"easily\\" beaten in a match race over a sprint distance in which he attempted to concede nineteen pounds to a filly called St Rosalia. Stud career Surplice began his stud career at the Turf Tavern at Doncaster at a fee of 25 guineas. He was not a success as a sire, with his offspring being characterised by R. H. Copperthwaite in his book \\"The Turf and the Racehorse\\" as being \\"tall, leggy, unwieldy and top-heavy\\". He did however, get the Poule d'Essai des Poulains winner Florin and he was the damsire of the 2000 Guineas winner Prince Charlie. After his death in 1871 at Woodbridge, Suffolk his cannon bones were made into handles for a pair of carving knives. Pedigree *Surplice was inbred 4x4 to Orville, meaning that the stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

The elevator is the only grain elevator in Buffalo that is located directly adjacent to Lake Erie. History Completed in 1925, the grain elevator was constructed by a co-operative of Canadian wheat farmers known as the Saskatchewan Co-operative Elevator Company. The cooperative owned the elevator until 1945 but turned over daily operations to Superior Grain Corporation, an offshoot of the Superior Elevator. It was purchased in 1945 by investors who called themselves the \\"Pool Elevator Company.\\" Pillsbury purchased the elevator facility in January 1952 for $1 million. The Cargill company later purchased the facility in 1964 as a holding facility for grain. Cargill eventually left Buffalo, abandoning the building. Cargill allowed the Pool to stand idle and to become delinquent in property tax payments. Upon default, the city of Buffalo placed the Pool on the auction block. The Pool Elevator, like all other grain elevators in Buffalo, was deeply affected by the 1959 opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway. Because the Buffalo elevators could be by- passed outright via the Seaway, fewer customers each year saw value in unloading grain to an elevator and reloading to rail cars bound for eastern ports. Storage The Pool Elevator transfer facility offered a total holding capacity of in 135 bins. The mainhouse features a capacity of of grain stored in 33 main cylindrical bins. Two of which are subdivided vertically to provide four quarter bins, twenty interspace bins, and twenty-four outerspace bins. The elevator was built in stages, as evidenced by the different extensions to the bins that make up the current structure. The two lakeside marine legs could siphon off every eight hours. Numerous boxcars were subsequently loaded on a track that could accommodate fifty-two cars at a time. The Pool could load 100 cars per day, each with a capacity. Virtually all receipts and shipments were in bulk, and the elevator handled a wide variety of wheat, oats, barley, and other grains. Present day The building is presently owned by South End Marina, and used for general storage. The original marine leg boat unloading towers and railroad tracks have been removed as the building is no longer used for grain storage. The south end marina operated on the property from the mid-1980s until 2011 when it closed after a fire that burned down the boat mechanic shop. The long finger pier that forms the dock that the elevator sits on is used as a base of operations for local dredging projects and marine equipment is often tied up there. This dock was also the last port of call for the vessels Aquarama/Marine Star and Lansdowne before both ships were towed away for scrap. The Cargill Pool Elevator, a.k.a. the Old Lakefront Grain Elevator, a.k.a. the Saskatchewan Cooperative Elevator (built by Canadian Farmers Cooperative), along with its property was again put up for auction. The auction date was scheduled for June 5, 2013. A yet unnamed bidder successfully purchased the elevator on the day of the auction for a sum of $475,000.00, confirmed by Cash Realty & Auction.

Since the Coast Guard policy in 1961 was not to name cutters under in length, it was designated as WPB-82332 when commissioned and acquired the name Point Roberts in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than .Scheina, p 76 Design and construction details Point Roberts was built to accommodate an 8-man crew.Scheina, p 71 She was powered by two VT800 Cummins diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed propellers. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full.Scheina, p 71 After 1990 she was refit with Caterpillar diesel main drive engines. Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360-degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.Scotti, p 165 The design specifications for Point Roberts included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room.Scotti, p 165 Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service.Scotti, p 165 The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.Scotti, p 166 Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in- charge and the executive petty officer.Scotti, p 166 The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.Scotti, p 166 History After delivery in 1961, Point Roberts was assigned a homeport of Mayport, Florida, where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat until decommissioning in 1992.Scheina, p 76 On 26 February 1965, she towed the disabled fishing vessel Cherry Lee 25 miles southeast of St. Augustine, Florida, to Mayport during rough weather. On 15 May 1966, she rescued a skin diver off Jacksonville, Florida. On 12 May 1968, she rescued three from fishing vessel Kingfisher 5 miles east of the mouth of the St. Johns River. On 21 July 1968, she medevaced injured seamen from the tanker Transhudson. On 12 January 1969, she escorted the distressed fishing vessel Eagle 25 miles northwest of Key West, Florida, to that port. On 4 August 1970, she medevaced a crewman from the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force training ship Katori off Jacksonville. On 28 November 1982, she helped seize motor vessel Lago Izabel and fishing vessel Gigi 120 miles east of Georgia carrying of marijuana. In January and February 1986, she recovered debris from space shuttle Challenger off Cape Canaveral, Florida. In August 1988, she escorted the Honduran motor vessel Unicorn Express into Mayport, where over of cocaine were found in a secret compartment.

The episode originally aired on NBC in the United States on January 12, 2012. It was written by Erica Rivinoja and was directed by Beth McCarthy-Miller. The episode also featured a guest appearance from Jason Lee as Chris and Reagan's neighbor and Ava's boyfriend, Kevin. During Reagan (Christina Applegate) and Chris's (Will Arnett) first New Year's Eve game night, Reagan's competitiveness comes out causing Chris to become embarrassed. Meanwhile, Missy (Jennifer Hall) brings an unexpected date along to the party and, Kevin (Jason Lee) starts to feel as though Ava (Maya Rudolph) may be ashamed of him. \\"New Year's Eve\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. According to the Nielsen Media Research, \\"New Year's Eve\\" drew 4.28 million viewers and received a 2.0 rating/5% share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, marking a 5% rise in the ratings from the previous episode, \\"First Christmas\\". It ranked third in its timeslot and was the second highest- rated NBC program of the night after The Office. Plot After not being able to find a baby-sitter for Amy, Reagan suggests that the two throw a game night, an idea Chris doesn't react well to. They invite Ava, Kevin, Missy, but Chris attempts to hide the games due to Reagan's competitive nature. He tries to make her promise that she won't be too competitive, but she does which makes the party awkward. While playing Rock Band the two get in a fight when Chris loses the beat on the drums because he was looking at his \\"drumming arm\\". Reagan decide to a make a list of \\"Things We Are Going to Stop Doing That Embarrass Each Other in 2012\\", which features annoying habits that the two want each other to give up. However, before 2011 comes to an end the two erase every thing from the list except for Chris's Borat impression and Reagen's competitive nature. Meanwhile, Ava is asked to be the grand marshal to a New Year's Day parade. This makes her boyfriend, Kevin, feel like he can't live up to her lifestyle. He then starts thinking she may be ashamed of him, especially after he isn't invited to sit with her during the parade. Eventually, Kevin confronts Ava on this and she reveals that if she messes up their relationship she doesn't wanted to be reminded of it while Googling her name. He assures her that their relationship won't end badly and the two go to the parade. Production This episode marks Jason Lee's fourth appearance in the series \\"New Year's Eve\\" was written by supervising producer Erica Rivinoja, marking her third writing credit for the series after \\"Mr. Bob's Toddler Kaleidoscope\\" and \\"Parents\\".

This is the first time the series aired in the 9:30 pm timeslot for the first season after The Office; the series previously aired in the 8:00pm timeslot on Wednesday.

Critical reviews \\"New Year's Eve\\" received several positive reviews from critics. New York writer Steven Heisler praised the episode for avoiding \\"sitcom-y territory\\" with the emotional ending. He also called the series a better choice to follow The Office then Whitney. The A.V. Club reviewer Margaret Eby complemented the believability of the main Reagen-Chris plot. Despite this, she criticized the Ava-Kevin subplot comparing it to a storyline from Sex and The City. She also noted the plotline didn't stay true to the characters following their plotline in the previous episode, \\"First Christmas\\". She ultimately rated the episode with a B. Adam Victavage of Paste called the episode a perfect transition from the previous episodes and allowed Ava to be \\"a loveable third wheel to a completely strong duo in Chris and Reagan\\". He also reacted positively for the scenes featuring Missy, comparing her scenes to \\"early Ava, but less obnoxious\\". He ultimately gave the episode an 8.7/10 calling it \\"commendable\\". Bradford Evans of SplitSider praised Jennifer Hall's performance calling her the \\"unsung hero\\" of the series. He also reacted positively towards the episode's ability to unify the show and \\"keep all of the characters on the same turf\\". He concluded that he hoped the series could make itself a vital part of the network's lineup. HitFix reviewer Alan Sepinwall called the episode \\"one its [the series] strongest episodes to date\\". He wrote that the addition of Jason Lee humanized Ava more and gave her a more natural reason to visit Reagan and Chris at home. He also wrote that the episode worked on a \\"character level\\".

It has been given the recommended English name of slimy waxcap in the UK. The species is widespread in temperate regions, occurring in grassland in Europe and in woodland in North America and elsewhere. Taxonomy The species was first described in 1801 by the South African-born mycologist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon as Agaricus irrigatus. It was subsequently combined in a number of different genera, before being transferred to Hygrocybe in 1976. The specific epithet comes from Latin \\"irrigatus\\" (= watered or bedewed), with reference to the viscid coating of the fruit bodies. Molecular research published in 2011, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, showed that Hygrocybe irrigata did not belong in Hygrocybe sensu stricto and it was moved to the genus Gliophorus in 2013. Description Basidiocarps are agaricoid, up to 100 mm (4 in) tall, the cap convex at first and remaining convex or becoming flat when expanded, up to 50 mm (2 in) across. The cap surface is very viscid when damp, striate at the margin, and pale greyish brown. The lamellae (gills) are whitish to pale cap- coloured and more or less decurrent (widely attached to and running down the stipe). The stipe (stem) is very viscid when damp, smooth, cylindrical or compressed, and grey to cap-coloured. The spore print is white, the spores (under a microscope) smooth, inamyloid, ellipsoid, about 6.5 to 8.0 by 4.5 to 5.0 Œºm. Distribution and habitat The slimy waxcap has been recorded in Europe, Central and North America, northern Asia, and Australia. Like other waxcaps, it grows in old, unimproved, short-sward grassland (pastures and lawns) in Europe, but in woodland elsewhere. Recent research suggests waxcaps are neither mycorrhizal nor saprotrophic but may be associated with mosses. Conservation In Europe, Gliophorus irrigatus is typical of waxcap grasslands, a declining habitat due to changing agricultural practices. The slimy waxcap is one of the commoner species, however, only appearing on the red lists of threatened fungi in a few countries, including the Czech Republic, Germany (Bavaria), and Poland.

An outfielder, Weber bats and throws left- handed. Considered a journeyman, Weber has played professionally in minor league baseball since 1999, without playing in Major League Baseball. Weber played collegiately for Los Angeles Harbor College and Texas Tech University before embarking on his professional career in 1999. As a professional, he played in the minor league organizations of the Cincinnati Reds, Oakland Athletics, Los Angeles Dodgers, Arizona Diamondbacks, Tampa Bay Rays, New York Yankees, and Detroit Tigers. He has also played independent league baseball in the unaffiliated Frontier League, Northern League, and American Association of Independent Professional Baseball. Weber has competed for the United States national baseball team, winning the gold medal at the 2009 Baseball World Cup. Amateur career Weber was born in Lakewood, California. He attended Lakewood High School in Lakewood, California. There, he played for the school's baseball team, known as the Lancers, graduating in 1996. Out of high school, Weber was selected by the Oakland Athletics in the thirty-first round of the 1997 Major League Baseball draft. However, he chose not to sign with the Athletics, opting to attend college. He began his college baseball career at Los Angeles Harbor College (LAHC) of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) in 1997. At LAHC, Weber was a NJCAA All-America selection. In 1999, Weber transferred to Texas Tech University to compete in the NCAA Division I during his junior year. At Texas Tech, he played college baseball for the Texas Tech Red Raiders baseball team in the Big 12 Conference. Weber led the conference with eight triples, setting a Red Raiders team record in the process. He was named the Collegiate Baseball National Player of the Week and Big 12 Baseball Player/Pitcher of the Week for the week of February 1, 1999. Weber became the fourth player in Texas Tech history to hit for the cycle. Professional career 1999‚Äì2004 Weber signed his first professional contract with the Cincinnati Reds as a non-drafted free agent in August 1999. He made his professional debut that summer with the Rookie-level Billings Mustangs of the Pioneer League, recording a .238 batting average, .365 on-base percentage (OBP) and .500 slugging percentage (SLG) with five home runs and 17 runs batted in (RBI) in 22 games. The next year, he hit .221 with a .333 OBP and .333 SLG with six home runs and 34 RBIs in 108 games for the Single-A Clinton LumberKings of the Midwest League. However, Weber was released by the Reds after the season. He felt the Reds \\"treated [him] like a non-prospect\\". In 2001, Weber played independent league baseball for the Canton Crocodiles of the Frontier League. He batted .307 with a .382 OBP, .559 SLG, 18 home runs and 69 RBI in 84 games, being named to the Frontier League post-season All-Star team. He led the Frontier League in home runs and triples. Canton sold Weber to the Fargo-Moorhead Redhawks of the independent Northern League in 2002, where he hit .296 with a .351 OBP, .501 SLG, and 30 doubles for Fargo-Morehead, placing fourth in the league in doubles. Back with Fargo-Moorhead to open 2003, he batted .309 with a .408 OBP and .520 SLG through 52 games, as the team went on to win the Northern League championship. However, in July 2003, the Oakland Athletics organization purchased Weber's contract from Fargo-Moorhead. With the Athletics organization, Weber hit .361 with a .394 OBP, .626 SLG, seven home runs and 48 RBIs in 35 games with the Single-A Advanced Modesto A's of the California League for the remainder of that year. In 2004, he hit .280 with a .356 OBP, .458 SLG, 15 home runs and 68 RBI in 111 games with the Double-A Midland RockHounds of the Texas League, and hit .341 with a .383 OBP, .568 SLG, two home runs and 12 RBI in 12 games with the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats of the Pacific Coast League (PCL), helping the River Cats win the PCL championship. 2005‚Äì2009 Weber signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers after the 2004 season as a free agent. In 2005, he hit .300 with a .369 OBP, .456 SLG, 11 home runs and 68 RBIs in 117 games with the Double-A Jacksonville Suns of the Southern League. He was ninth in the league in batting average and led the league's outfielders in assists (19) and double plays (7). With Weber, Jacksonville won the Southern League championship, his third year in a row as a member of a championship-winning team. During the season, Weber received a 15-game suspension for violating minor league baseball's drug policy. Weber, who failed a drug test administered in August 2004, said he had taken thermogin, a supplement that contained the banned substance ephedrine, and denied taking steroids. After starting the 2006 season with the Triple-A Las Vegas Stars of the PCL, where he hit .258 with a .338 OBP, .352 SLG, 2 home runs and 31 RBI in 82 games, he was released. He signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks, where he played for the Triple-A Tucson Sidewinders of the PCL, hitting .321 with a .374 OBP, .518 SLG, 5 home runs and 27 RBI in 46 games. The Sidewinders won the PCL championship, Weber's fourth consecutive league championship. Weber was released by the Diamondbacks during 2007 spring training. He signed with Fargo-Moorhead. After 16 games there, batting .283 with a .371 OBP and .417 SLG, his contract was sold to the Texas Rangers on June 4, 2007. The Rangers assigned him to the Single-A Advanced Bakersfield Blaze of the California League, where he hit .356 with a .416 OBP, .550 SLG, five home runs, 14 doubles, 25 RBI, and 34 runs scored in 37 games. After spending a month with the Rangers organization, on July 16, the Tampa Bay Rays purchased his contract from the Rangers and assigned him to the Triple-A Durham Bulls of the International League. There, he hit .265 with three home runs and 21 RBIs in 39 games. Weber re-signed with the Rays on a minor league contract after the 2007 season, and batted .265 with a .334 OBP, .447 SLG, 13 home runs for the Bulls in 2008. Weber returned to the Rays' organization in 2009, almost making the Rays' opening day roster until Matt Joyce recovered from an injury. Weber returned to Durham, where he hit .302 with 14 home runs in 117 games, and led the 2009 International League with 46 doubles and finished ninth in batting average. He was named to the International League post-season All-Star team. 2010‚Äìpresent After the 2009 season, Weber signed with the New York Yankees organization and was invited to spring training for the 2010 season. Weber signed with the Yankees because they gave him an opportunity to compete for a job in the major leagues, while other teams told him they viewed him exclusively as a minor leaguer. In spring training, Weber led the Yankees with a .483 batting average and was presented with the James P. Dawson Award, given annually to the best rookie in the Yankees' camp. Manager Joe Girardi indicated that Weber could beat out Marcus Thames and Rule 5 draft pick Jamie Hoffmann for the fifth outfielder position on the Yankees 25 man roster, but ultimately the Yankees chose Thames, as the Yankees preferred a right-handed batter to complement their left-handed hitting outfielders, and assigned Weber to the Triple-A Scranton Wilkes-Barre Yankees. He hit .258 with no home runs in 47 games with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre before being released by the Yankees on June 3. He signed with the Detroit Tigers, reporting to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens of the International League. He hit .256 with a .310 OBP and .372 SLG in 21 games for Toledo. He announced his retirement on July 15, 2010. On July 19, 2010, Major League Baseball announced Weber's 100-game suspension for having failed a drug test for the third time. The drug was identified as a \\"drug of abuse\\" rather than a performance-enhancing drug. Despite announcing his retirement earlier in the year, Weber continued his career in leagues unaffiliated with MLB. He played winter league baseball in the winter of 2010‚Äì11 in the Dominican Republic, then signed with the Winnipeg Goldeyes of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball in June when they had an injury to outfielder Jonathan Wyatt. Weber was named the team's most valuable player. Weber returned to Winnipeg for the 2012 season. After batting .281 in 78 games, the Goldeyes waived Weber, giving him his unconditional release. International career Weber joined the United States national baseball team for the 2009 Baseball World Cup held in Nettuno, Italy in September 2009, helping the United States win the gold medal. Weber made the Cup's All- Tournament Team. Weber has routinely played winter league baseball. Following the 2006 season, Weber played for the Naranjeros de Hermosillo of the Mexican Pacific League (MPL), appearing in the 2006 Caribbean Series. He played for the Ca√±eros de Los Mochis of the MPL after the 2007 season. With the Venados de Mazatl√°n of the MPL after the 2008 season, Weber reached the 2009 Caribbean Series. In the 2011‚Äì12 offseason, he played for the Gigantes del Cibao of the Dominican Winter League. Personal life Weber is divorced. He has two children. Weber works in construction during his time away from baseball to help make ends meet.

Born in Milan, Italy, Sagan lost her parents in her teenage years to the Black Brigades of Benito Mussolini. Like her parents, she was active in the Italian resistance movement, gathering intelligence and supplying Jews in hiding. She was captured and tortured in 1945, but escaped on the eve of her execution with the help of Nazi defectors. After studying in Paris, she attended graduate school in child development in the US and married Leonard Sagan, a physician. The couple then resettled in Atherton, California, where Sagan founded the first chapter of Amnesty International in the western US. She later toured the region, helping to establish more than 75 chapters, and organized events to raise money for political prisoners. In 1984, Sagan was elected the honorary chair of Amnesty International USA. US President Bill Clinton awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1996, and Italy later awarded her the rank of Grand Ufficiale Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana (Grand Official Order of Merit of the Italian Republic). Amnesty International founded an annual Ginetta Sagan Award for activists in her honor. Childhood and World War II Ginetta Sagan was born in Milan, Italy, to a Catholic father and a Jewish mother. Both of her parents were doctors. Facing rising antisemitism in Europe, her parents arranged false papers identifying her as Christian to hide her Jewish roots. When World War II began, both of her parents became active in the Italian resistance movement opposing fascist rule, only to be arrested in 1943 by Mussolini's Black Brigades. Her father was later shot in a staged \\"attempted escape\\", and her mother sent to Auschwitz, where she died. Ginetta, then seventeen years old, was already active in the resistance movement, delivering food coupons and clothing to Jews who were in hiding. Following her parents' disappearance, she became a courier for resistance forces in Northern Italy, as well as helping to print and distribute antigovernment pamphlets. On one occasion, she dressed as a cleaning lady to steal letterhead from government offices so that it could be used to forge letters of safe passage to Switzerland. Due to her energy and small size (she never grew to more than five feet tall), she received the nickname Topolino (\\"Little Mouse\\"). In late February 1945, Sagan was betrayed by an informer in the movement and, like her parents, arrested by the Black Brigades. During her 45 days of imprisonment, she was beaten, raped, and tortured, leading up to a scheduled April 23 execution. At one point, a jailer tossed her a loaf of bread that contained a matchbox with the word coraggio (\\"courage\\") written inside, a moment which would motivate much of her later work on behalf of prisoners. On the day of her scheduled execution, she was being beaten by guards in a villa in Sondrio, Italy, when a pair of German officers forced her Italian captors to release her into their custody. She later recalled watching the stars from the window of their car and thinking, \\"I will never see another dawn.\\" However, the Germans revealed themselves to be Nazi defectors collaborating with her resistance comrades, and they delivered Sagan safely to a Catholic hospital. Sagan annually celebrated the date of April 23 for the rest of her life. Post-war life After Sagan recuperated, she lived in Paris for a time with her godfather, attending the Sorbonne. In 1951, she emigrated to the US to study at the University of Illinois at Chicago, majoring in child development. While there, she met Leonard Sagan, then a young medical student. The couple were married the following year, and would remain together until Leonard's death in 1997. Following their marriage, the pair moved to Washington, D.C. for Leonard's work. Sagan also worked part-time teaching cooking classes to the wives of US Congressmen. The couple later lived in Boston and Japan before settling in Atherton, California in 1968. Sagan lived there until her death from cancer on August 25, 2000. Ginetta is survived by her three sons- Duncan, Loring, and Stuart. Involvement with Amnesty International Though Amnesty International (AI) had a growing reputation in the UK, at this time, the organization was still in largely unknown in the US. Only eighteen chapters of AI USA had been formed by 1968, all of them in the eastern US, totaling less than a thousand members. Sagan had been involved in the organization in Washington, D.C., and when she arrived in Atherton, she founded the US's 19th chapter, holding its meetings in her living room. The chapter later grew into AI USA's first West Coast regional office. In 1971, Sagan organized a concert with singer Joan Baez, one of her Atherton neighbors, in order to raise money for Greek political prisoners; the concert drew more than 10,000 people. In her memoirs, Baez described Sagan during the period as having \\"the gifts of an active mind, a love of life and beauty, an unquashable spirit, and a faith in people very much like that of Anne Frank.\\" In the three years that followed, Sagan traveled throughout the American West, founding 75 more AI chapters. By 1978, AI USA's membership had increased to 70,000, more than 100 times that of a decade before. An AI spokesman later attributed Sagan with doing more than anyone to establish Amnesty International in the US, adding that \\"I think she has probably organized more people than anyone else in the human rights movement globally\\". She also founded the organization's first newsletter, Matchbox, in 1973. Sagan became a figure of controversy from the right and later from the left in the 1970s when she and Baez shifted their focus from protesting abuses by American forces in the Vietnam War to protesting the abuses of North Vietnamese reeducation camps following the war.Sagan, Ginetta, \\"Vietnam‚Äôs Postwar Hell,\\" Newsweek, May 3, 1982, p. 13. A colleague remembers fellow anti-war activists being \\"furious\\" that Sagan would criticize the new Vietnamese communist regime in the same terms she had criticized the US Armed Forces, and Sagan later recalled accusations that she was a fascist or undercover CIA operative. Over the next decade, she also advocated on behalf of prisoners in Chile, the USSR, Poland, and Greece. She served on the AI USA National Board of Directors from 1983-87. In 1994, she was elected the organization's Honorary Chair of the Board. In addition to her work with Amnesty International, Sagan founded the Aurora Foundation, which investigates and publicizes incidents of human rights abuses. Awards In 1987, Sagan won a Jefferson Award for Public Service in the category of \\"Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged\\". In 1996, US President Bill Clinton awarded Sagan the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor of the US. In the citation, he stated that \\"Ginetta Sagan's name is synonymous with the fight for human rights around the world. She represents to all the triumph of the human spirit over tyranny.\\" The same year, she was awarded the Grand Ufficiale Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana, Italy's highest honor. Ginetta Sagan Fund Amnesty International created the Ginetta Sagan Fund in 1994 in Sagan's honor. The fund grants a $20,000 annual award to a woman or women \\"who are working to protect the liberty and lives of women and children in areas where human rights violations are widespread\\".

Masson reached this conclusion while he had access to some of Freud's unpublished letters as projects director of the Sigmund Freud Archives. The Assault on Truth was first published in 1984 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux; several revised editions have since been published. The book aroused massive publicity and controversy. It received many negative reviews, several of which rejected Masson's reading of psychoanalytic history. It was condemned by reviewers within the psychoanalytic profession, and came to be seen as the latest in a series of attacks on psychoanalysis and an expression of a widespread \\"anti- Freudian mood\\". The book has received criticism from both supporters and critics of psychoanalysis. Its overall reception has been described as mixed. Some feminists endorsed Masson's conclusions, and other commentators have seen merit in his book despite its failings. Masson has been criticized for misrepresenting the seduction theory and maintaining without evidence that it was correct. He has also been criticized for his discussion of Freud's treatment of his patient Emma Eckstein, for suggesting that children are by nature innocent and asexual, and for taking part in a reaction against the sexual revolution. Masson has been blamed for encouraging the recovered memory movement by implying that a collective effort to retrieve painful memories of incest was required, although he has rejected the accusation as unfounded. Summary Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. Masson argues that Freud deliberately suppressed the seduction theory. Masson argues that the accepted account of the way in which, Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, abandoned his seduction theory is incorrect. According to Masson, Freud's female patients told him in 1895 and 1896 that they had been abused as children, but Freud later came to disbelieve their accounts. He argues that Freud was wrong to disbelieve his female patients and that the real reason Freud abandoned the seduction theory is that he could not accept that children are \\"the victims of sexual violence and abuse within their own families\\". He suggests that Freud's theories of \\"internal fantasy and of spontaneous childhood sexuality\\", which he developed after abandoning the seduction theory, allowed sexual violence to be attributed to the victim's imagination, and therefore posed no threat to the existing social order. Masson acknowledges the tentative nature of his reinterpretation of Freud's reasons for abandoning the seduction theory. He criticizes other accounts of Freud's work, including that provided by the psychoanalyst Ernest Jones in The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud (1953-1957). He also discusses Freud's 1896 essay \\"The Aetiology of Hysteria\\", which he provides in an appendix. He also discusses the work of the doctor Auguste Ambroise Tardieu, Freud's treatment of Emma Eckstein, Freud's theory of the Oedipus complex, and Freud's relationship with the psychoanalyst S√°ndor Ferenczi. Background and publication history According to the historian Roy Porter, Masson, formerly a Sanskrit professor, retrained as a psychoanalyst, and in the 1970s found support within the psychoanalytic profession in the United States. Masson's relationship with the psychoanalyst Kurt R. Eissler helped Masson become the projects director of the Freud Archives, where he was entrusted with publishing the authorized edition of the correspondence between Freud and Wilhelm Fliess. Masson aroused controversy after presenting his views about the origins of Freud's psychoanalytic theories in a paper delivered at a 1981 meeting of the Western New England Psychoanalytic Society. The New York Times printed two articles reporting Masson's views, as well as an interview with him. Eissler fired Masson, who retaliated with writs. The journalist Janet Malcolm published two articles about the controversy, later issued as a book, In the Freud Archives (1984), in The New Yorker. The Assault on Truth was first published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in 1984. Revised editions followed in 1985, 1992, 1998, and 2003. Reception Overview The Assault on Truth provoked controversy and aroused massive publicity. The book received notice in publications such as Newsweek, Maclean's, The New York Times Book Review, and New Statesman and Society. In Maclean's, the book was described as the latest in a series of attacks on psychoanalysis, and Masson was quoted saying, \\"I think that as a result of my findings, we should give up on psychoanalysis as a means of helping people.\\" In The New York Times Book Review, the critic Harold Bloom described the book as \\"dubious\\". In New Statesman and Society, Jenny Turner dismissed the book, accusing Masson of spite, misreadings, and making inept arguments. The book received attention and endorsement from some feminists. The feminist lawyer Catharine MacKinnon described The Assault on Truth as a revealing discussion of Freud. However, the critic Camille Paglia criticized feminists for their interest in Masson's work, deeming it part of an obsession with exposing the failings of great figures. Porter described the book as \\"tendentious\\", but a necessary corrective to The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud, a work that in his view depicted Freud in an overly positive way. He observed that it received a mixed response because of the circumstances surrounding its publication, which included the growing public distrust of psychoanalysis since the 1960s, especially among feminists, and that it was condemned by psychoanalysts and their supporters. Commentators supportive of psychoanalysis who criticized the book include the historian Peter Gay, the philosopher Richard Wollheim, the historian Paul Robinson, the social theorist Anthony Elliott, and the psychoanalyst Kurt R. Eissler. Gay called the book a \\"sensational polemic\\" and wrote that Masson had confused discussion of Freud's seduction theory and that Masson's suggestions about why Freud abandoned the theory were preposterous. Wollheim wrote that the book was a vehement work that presented questionable conclusions. Robinson wrote that The Assault on Truth was an expression of an \\"anti-Freudian mood\\" that was growing more aggressive in the 1980s. He suggested that Masson interpreted Freud's work exclusively in terms of a preoccupation with the seduction theory. He accused Masson of claiming, without clear evidence, that the seduction theory was correct, largely ignoring the reasons Freud gave for abandoning the theory, and failing to show that Freud did not consider those reasons persuasive. He accused Masson of misleadingly editing Freud's letters with Fliess. He also maintained that opposition to the seduction theory was based on rational skepticism rather than an inability to accept the existence of childhood sexual abuse, and that it was extremely unlikely that Freud would abandon the seduction theory out of cowardice only to then adopt the provocative theory of infantile sexuality. He was unconvinced by Masson's attempts to use evidence such as Freud's treatment of Eckstein and a paper by Ferenczi to support his views. He argued that Masson viewed children as \\"innocent and inert\\", and suggested that Masson's work was part of a reaction against the sexual revolution. He compared The Assault on Truth to two works by psychologists, Frank Sulloway's Freud, Biologist of the Mind (1979) and Marianne Kr√ºll's Freud and His Father (1979). Eissler wrote that while The Assault on Truth achieved success, the book was a \\"literary hoax\\". He accused Masson of misrepresenting the seduction theory by failing to explain that it claimed that \\"adult psychopathology emerges exclusively when a child's genitalia had been abused\\", and of falsely claiming that Freud disputed the existence of \\"infantile abuse\\" after abandoning the theory. Elliott noted that the book became a best-seller. However, he argued that Masson misrepresented Freud, and that his critique of Freud is flawed, since \\"Freud did not dispute his patients' accounts of actual seduction and sexual abuse\\", being concerned rather with the way in which \\"external events are suffused with fantasy and desire.\\" The book also received criticism from commentators critical of psychoanalysis, such as the philosopher Adolf Gr√ºnbaum, the authors Allen Esterson and Richard Webster, and the critic Frederick Crews. Gr√ºnbaum argued that regardless of the merits of Masson's accusation that Freud abandoned the seduction theory out of cowardice, Masson's position that \\"actual seductions\\" are the etiological factors in the development of hysteria is unfounded and credulous. Esterson wrote that while Masson charged Freud with a failure of nerve by asserting that his patients' reports of childhood seductions were mostly childhood fantasies it was questionable whether they had indeed reported childhood seductions. Esterson also discussed the book in History of the Human Sciences, and History of Psychology, where he wrote that the evidence it presents does not support Masson's claims about how the medical community responded to Freud's seduction theory, and that other evidence and research, which Masson ignores, refutes Masson's claim that \\"Freud's early psychoanalytic writings received an irrationally hostile reception\\". Webster compared the book to E. M. Thornton's The Freudian Fallacy (1983). He suggested that Masson retained a partly positive view of Freud. While he credited Masson with making contributions to the history of psychoanalysis, he wrote that Masson's main argument has not convinced either psychoanalysts or the majority of Freud's critics, since scholars have disputed that Freud formulated the seduction theory on the basis of memories of childhood seduction provided by his patients. Webster stated that the theory maintained that episodes of childhood seduction would have a pathological effect only if the victim had no conscious recollection of them, and the purpose of Freud's therapeutic sessions was not to listen to freely offered recollections but to encourage his patients to discover or construct scenes of which they had no recollection. He blamed Masson for encouraging the spread of the recovered memory movement by implying that most or all serious cases of neurosis are caused by child sexual abuse, that psychoanalysts were collectively engaged in a massive denial of this fact, and that an equally massive collective effort to retrieve painful memories of incest was required. Masson rejected Webster's suggestion, stating that he had expressed no interest in memory retrieval in the book. Crews wrote that The Assault on Truth was a naive work that made Masson a celebrity. Crews maintained that Masson had failed to learn from critiques of the book, and that its arguments depended on fallacies. In The New York Review of Books, Crews called the book a melodramatic work in which Masson misrepresented \\"Freud's 'seduction' patients as self-aware incest victims rather than as the doubters that they remained\\". Other authors who have discussed the book include the literary scholar Ritchie Robertson, the psychologist Louis Breger, and the scholar John Kerr. Robertson wrote that Masson overstated the case against Freud, observing that while Freud may have underestimated the frequency of child abuse, he did not deny that it does often occur. Breger wrote that Masson provided valuable information on the later life of Eckstein and was correct to question the accepted account of the abandonment of the seduction theory. However, he found Masson's speculations about why Freud abandoned the theory unconvincing. Kerr described the book as flawed but useful in bringing psychoanalytic attention to childhood sexual abuse. Reviews The Assault on Truth received negative reviews from the historian Peter Gay in The Philadelphia Inquirer, the psychoanalyst Anthony Storr in The New York Times Book Review, Stephen A. Mitchell in Library Journal, Herbert Wray in Psychology Today, the psychoanalyst Charles Rycroft in The New York Review of Books, the philosopher Arnold Davidson in the London Review of Books, the philosopher Frank Cioffi in The Times Literary Supplement, Charles Hanly in The International Journal of Psycho-Analysis, and Lawrence Birken in Theory & Society. The book received positive reviews from the psychiatrist Judith Lewis Herman in The Nation and Pierre-E. Lacocque in the American Journal of Psychotherapy. The book was also reviewed by Ms., The Economist, and Choice. Other reviews included those by the historian Paul Robinson in The New Republic, Elaine Hoffman Baruch in The New Leader, Michael Heffernan in New Statesman, Kenneth Levin in the American Journal of Psychiatry, Thomas H. Thompson in North American Review, F. S. Schwarzbach in The Southern Review, the psychiatrist Bob Johnson in New Scientist, Thelma Oliver in the Canadian Journal of Political Science, the psychoanalyst Donald P. Spence in the American Journal of Orthopsychiatry, Gary Alan Fine in Contemporary Sociology, D. A. Strickland in the American Political Science Review, Franz Samelson in Isis, and the philosopher John Oulton Wisdom in Philosophy of the Social Sciences. Storr dismissed the book and denied that Freud would have abandoned a theory \\"because it was unacceptable to the medical establishment\\". Mitchell wrote that while Masson provided fascinating excerpts from important documents relating to Freud that had previously been carefully guarded, his conclusions were \\"characterized by a bitter tendentiousness, simplistic rhetoric, and a serious lack of comprehension of the subtleties of later psychoanalyic theorizing.\\" Wray dismissed Masson's arguments as \\"speculative\\". Rycroft maintained that because Masson chose to present the book as a polemical attack on Freud, it did not qualify as a contribution to the early history of psychoanalysis. He accused Masson of ignoring contrary evidence, presenting unconvincing evidence, and being unable to \\"distinguish between \\"facts, inferences, and speculations\\". However, he granted that Masson had discovered some information likely to permanently damage Freud's image, including evidence that Freud was more familiar with the forensic literature on child abuse than his works suggested. The information also included details about Freud and Fliess's bungled treatment of Eckstein, and evidence that Freud‚Äôs repudiation of Ferenczi and his 1932 paper ‚ÄúConfusion of Tongues between Adults and the Child‚Äù \\"was provoked by Ferenczi‚Äôs having rediscovered the truth of the seduction theory that he had suppressed thirty-five years.\\" He criticized Masson for wanting to re-establish the truth of the seduction theory without presenting evidence that it was actually correct, and concluded that the book was \\"distasteful, misguided, and at times silly.\\" In response, Masson defended the book and accused Rycroft of various errors. Hanly wrote that while it had provoked controversy, reviewers had largely dismissed the book. He expressed agreement with the negative reviews it had already received, and criticized Masson's claim that Freud interpreted Eckstein's bleeding followed a nasal operation as hysterical, arguing that it misrepresented what Freud wrote. Birken argued that Masson's attempt to revive the seduction theory was more important than his speculations about why Freud abandoned it. He maintained that Masson's repudiation of all of psychoanalysis since the abandonment of the seduction theory meant that his book was \\"highly conservative\\", and that it had \\"won an important place in the growing literature of cultural conservatism that takes its stand against the emergence of mass culture based on consumption.\\" According to Birken, by rejecting the Oedipus complex, Masson \\"repudiates the development of an autonomous sexual science\\", and by reviving the seduction theory he denies that children have any sexuality. He found that Masson's affection for Tardieu suggested a rejection of the conventional historiography of sexual science. He suggested that Masson de-sexualized not only children, but also, by implication, women. Herman described the book as well-documented, well-written, carefully reasoned, and fascinating. However, she suggested that Masson's charge that Freud abandoned the seduction theory out of personal cowardice might be overly harsh, arguing that it overstated the role of Freud as an individual and ignored the general secrecy surrounding the issues of rape and incest. She wrote that while Masson did not definitively resolve the question of why Freud abandoned the seduction theory, he was right to reopen the issue. She credited Masson with demonstrating that once Freud abandoned the seduction theory, any further consideration of its possible validity became \\"a heresy\\" within psychoanalysis. She also praised Masson for documenting Freud's attempt to stop Ferenczi from publicizing his rediscovery of \\"the kind of clinical data on which the seduction theory was based\\". She criticized the press coverage that The Assault on Truth had received, writing that the press had attempted to defend a \\"psychoanalytic establishment\\" that had been rendered \\"speechless\\" by it. According to Herman, reviews of The Assault on Truth had been almost uniformly negative. She accused critics of making ad hominem attacks on Masson or criticizing him by focusing on issues that were of secondary importance, and faulted Janet Malcolm for her unflattering characterizations of Masson in The New Yorker. Lacocque described the book as impressive. He praised Masson's scholarship.

Menasco Motors Company of Burbank, California was a well known manufacturer of inverted inline four and six cylinder engines. At the request of Lockheed Aircraft designers, Menasco produced an inverted twelve-cylinder air cooled aircraft engine by designing a common crankcase and gearbox for two of the six cylinder engines. The two crankshafts were combined with a unique double clutch gearbox to power a single propeller. This gave reliability of a twin engine aircraft in a single powerplant. It was a success, but did not enter production as no aircraft were produced that used it. Design and development In mid-1935 Lockheed's chief engineer, Hall Hibbard, began discussing with Al Menasco, the president of the Menasco Motors Company in Burbank, the merits of coupling two Menasco C6S Super Buccaneer six-cylinder in-line engines mounted side-by-side, driving a single propeller. In 1937 Lockheed established the AiRover Aircraft Company as a subsidiary to give Lockheed a place in the personal aviation market. Hall Hibbard wanted AiRover to use Menasco's novel twin powerplant in its first aircraft. AirRover used components of various Lockheed aircraft to construct what was designated as the Lockheed Altair 8G to serve as a flying test stand for the unproven Menasco engine. This test bed was first flown in December 1937 and confirmed the merits of its powerplant, leading to the decision to proceed with the design of a similarly-powered five-seat feeder- liner.Francillon During 1938 the AiRover Company was reorganized as the Vega Aircraft Corporation, and with Mac V.F. Shortits installed as president, it started the design the new feeder-liner. Jack Wassail was the project engineer, and the aircraft was soon under construction in Vega's new A-1 plant, located at the recently purchased Lockheed Air Terminal.http://www.pilotfriend.com/acft_manu/Lockheed%20Martin.htm Applications The \\"Flying Testbed\\" was a custom built Vega Altair 8 (NX18149) used to test the experimental 520 hp Menasco Unitwin for use in planned Starliner. The engine was two 260 hp Menasco C6S-4 Super Buccaneer engines mounted to a common gearbox that drove a single, two-blade, variable- pitch propeller. When it was no longer needed, the airplane was sold to Howard Batt, a Lockheed dealer. It was repowered with a 450 hp Pratt & Whitney Wasp SC in 1939, and was then registered as a Lockheed Altair 8-D in 1940.aircraftone.com Starliner Model 2, registered NX21725, rolled out of the factory in the spring of 1939 as a low-wing cabin monoplane with twin vertical tail surfaces. Its tricycle undercarriage retracted aft, with the wheels partially protruding beneath the nose and wing. The Starliner was the first totally new Vega Airplane Company aircraft. It made its maiden flight at [Burbank on April 22, 1939, with Vern Dorrell as pilot and J.B. Kendrick as engineering observer. The flight ended with an emergency when the propeller accidentally slipped into fine pitch. Vern Dorrell succeeded in landing on a vacant field, with minimum damage to the aircraft. During repairs the twin tail was changed to a single vertical tail surface and an upgraded 640 hp Unitwin engine, the Starliner model 2 became the model 22 when it resumed its test flights. The Starliner was damaged again when Bud Martin had to land it on its main wheels when the nose wheel failed to come down. With the nose protected by the partially protruding front wheel, the aircraft again escaped with only slight damage to its lower cowling. Repaired a second time, the Starliner satisfactorily completed a total of 85 flying hours; but due to its limited capacity of a pilot and four or five passengers, it was too small to satisfy the needs of the airlines. Menasco and Vega were increasingly occupied with military contracts. The only Starliner ended its life as a non-flying prop at a film studio. Variants The Unitwin was developed in at least three versions: ;520 hp Unitwin : Original version ;600 hp Unitwin : for the Starliner model 2 ;640 hp Unitwin : for the Starliner model 22 None of these engines survived Specifications (U 2-544)  References *Francillon, Ren√© J, Lockheed Aircraft since 1913.

History Boomerang first started at the former Rafaela Padilla in Puebla, Puebla in Mexico, as Boomerang from 1984 to 1986 and was the first Boomerang ever built by Vekoma. Then the roller coaster was relocated to Reino Aventura as Boomerang in 1988. A couple years later in 1992, Boomerang got a new name as Escorpi√≥n (themed to a Scorpion), until 1999. When Six Flags purchased Reino Aventura and transformed the park to Six Flags M√©xico in 2000, Escorpi√≥n was renamed back to Boomerang as it is the current name in the present. Ride When the coaster starts, the train is pulled backwards up the lift hill, then dropped through the loading gate through a cobra roll and then one loop. At the end of this cycle the train is pulled up the lift hill at the end of the track, then dropped once again allowing the train to go back through the loops backwards. This is the standard Vekoma Boomerang roller coaster design found at forty-three different amusement parks worldwide.

Most often, it refers to a JavaScript library that implements an HTML5 web standard, either an established standard (supported by some browsers) on older browsers, or a proposed standard (not supported by any browsers) on existing browsers. Formally, \\"a polyfill is a shim for a browser API\\". Polyfills allow web developers to use an API regardless of whether or not it is supported by a browser, and usually with minimal overhead. Typically they first check if a browser supports an API, and use it if available, otherwise using their own implementation.\\"It typically checks if a browser supports an API. If it doesn‚Äôt, the polyfill installs its own implementation. That allows you to use the API in either case.\\" Polyfills themselves use other, more supported features, and thus different polyfills may be needed for different browsers. The term is also used as a verb: polyfilling is providing a polyfill for a feature. Definition The term is a neologism, coined by Remy Sharp, who required a word that meant \\"replicate an API using JavaScript (or Flash or whatever) if the browser doesn‚Äôt have it natively\\" while co-writing the book Introducing HTML5 in 2009. Formally, \\"a shim is a library that brings a new API to an older environment, using only the means of that environment.\\", and polyfills exactly fit this definition; the term shim was also used for early polyfills, such as HTML5 Shiv. However, to Sharp shim connoted non-transparent APIs and workarounds, such as spacer GIFs for layout, sometimes known as \`shim.gif\`, and similar terms such as progressive enhancement and graceful degradation were not appropriate, so he invented a new term. The term is based on the multipurpose filling paste brand Polyfilla, a paste used to cover up cracks and holes in walls, and the meaning \\"fill in holes (in functionality) in many (poly-) ways\\". The word since gained popularity, particularly due to its use by Paul Irish and in Modernizr documentation. The distinction that Sharp makes is: This distinction is not drawn by other authors. At times various other distinctions are drawn between shims, polyfills, and fallbacks, but there are no generally accepted distinctions: most consider polyfills a form of shim. The term polyfiller is also occasionally found.  Examples   core-js  core-js is one of the most popular JavaScript standard library polyfills. Includes polyfills for ECMAScript up to 2019: promises, symbols, collections, iterators, typed arrays, many other features, ECMAScript proposals, some cross-platform WHATWG / W3C features and proposals like \`URL\`. You can load only required features or use it without global namespace pollution. Integrated with Babel which allows automatically inject required core-js modules to your code.  HTML5 Shiv  In IE versions prior to 9, unknown HTML elements like and would be parsed as empty elements, breaking the page's nesting structure and making those elements impossible to style using CSS. One of the most widely used polyfills, html5shiv, exploits another quirk of IE to work around this bug: calling \`document.createElement(\\"tagname\\")\` for each of the new HTML5 elements, which causes IE to parse them correctly. It also includes basic default styling for those HTML5 elements.  -prefix-free  Though most polyfills target out-of-date browsers, some exist to simply push modern browsers forward a little bit more. Lea Verou's -prefix-free polyfill is such a polyfill, allowing current browsers to recognise the unprefixed versions of several CSS3 properties instead of requiring the developer to write out all the vendor prefixes. It reads the page's stylesheets and replaces any unprefixed properties with their prefixed counterparts recognised by the current browser.  Selectivizr  Keith Clark's Selectivizr is a popular polyfill that makes many CSS3 selectors work in IE 8 and below. It reads the page's stylesheets looking for a number of known CSS3 selectors, then uses a JavaScript selector library to query the document for elements matching those selectors, applying the styles directly to those elements. It supports several JavaScript selector libraries such as jQuery.  Flexie  Possibly one of the most anticipated features of CSS3, Flexible Box Layout (a.k.a. Flexbox) promises to be an extremely powerful tool for laying out interface elements. WebKit and Mozilla engines have supported a preliminary draft syntax for years. Flexie implements support for that same syntax in IE and Opera. However, the draft spec has undergone a drastic revision to a new (and much more powerful) syntax, which is not yet supported by Flexie. Flexie can still be used along with the old syntax, but the developer must make sure they include the new syntax for future browsers as well.  CSS3 PIE  PIE (\\"Progressive Internet Explorer\\") implements some of the most popular missing CSS3 box decoration properties in IE, including border-radius and box-shadow for IE 8 and below, and linear-gradient backgrounds for IE 9 and below. Invoked as a HTC behavior (a proprietary IE feature), it looks for the unsupported CSS3 properties on specific elements and renders those properties using VML for IE 6‚Äì8 and SVG for IE 9. Its rendering is mostly indistinguishable from native browser implementations and it handles dynamic DOM modification well.  JSON 2  Douglas Crockford originally wrote json2.js as an API for reading and writing his (then up-and- coming) JSON data format. It became so widely used that browser vendors decided to implement its API natively and turn it into a de facto standard; Since json2.js now implements features native to newer browsers into older browsers, it has become a polyfill instead of a library.  es5-shim  ECMAScript 5th Edition (\\"ES5\\") brings some useful new scripting features, and since they're syntactically compatible with older JavaScript engines they can mostly be polyfilled by patching methods onto built-in JS objects. This es5-shim polyfill does it in two parts: es5-shim.js contains those methods that can be fully polyfilled, and es5-sham.js contains partial implementations of the other methods which rely too much on the underlying engine to work accurately.  FlashCanvas  FlashCanvas is an implementation of the HTML5 Canvas API using an Adobe Flash plug-in. A rare commercial polyfill, it comes in a paid version, as well as a free version, which lacks a few advanced features like shadows.  MediaElement.js  John Dyer's MediaElement.js polyfills support for \`\` and \`\` elements, including the HTML5 MediaElement API, in older browsers using Flash or Silverlight plug-ins. It also provides an optional media player UI for those elements, which is consistent across all browsers.  BrowserID  Authentication protocol proposed by Mozilla, failed to gain traction.  Webshims Lib  Alexander Farkas's Webshims Lib aggregates many other polyfills together into a single package and conditionally loads only those needed by the visiting browser.

It is based around the idea that cinema is a universal visual language that people of almost any culture can enjoy and even create regardless of where they are, who they know or how much money they have. It has been called \\"the global story of cinema and how it affects our everyday lives.\\" The documentary was filmed by Greyhavens in 2009 while he traveled on a Thomas J. Watson Fellowship. Synopsis The film follows real-time stories of actors, directors and cinema viewers in four different countries. In Tunisia, a documentary film director struggles to have his frank film about human sexuality be seen in their conservative culture. In India, a young actress struggles with the challenges of making a name for herself while dealing with racist barriers. And in Scotland, actress Tilda Swinton and filmmaker Mark Cousins, create a film festival that travels to audiences rather than having the audiences come to the festival. These stories jump back and forth as the narratives develop, interspersed with scenes from video stores, projection booths and homes of all kinds. Toward the end of film there are brief commentaries by Indian film director Sudhir Mishra and Chinese director Fruit Chan. Reception The film premiered at the Austin Film Festival on October 22, 2011, and received an enthusiastic reception. One reviewer called it \\"a love letter to the joy, beauty, pain and importance of a tool and art form that in 24 frames per second can express our deepest hopes and fears and connect us all.\\" It was screened a month later at the Costa Rica International Film Festival. In January 2012, it was seen at the Jaipur International Film Festival in Jaipur, India.

She successfully demonstrated that care of hospitalised infants by their mothers prevented infections.  Life and career  Cecily Pickerill was born in Taihape, New Zealand, in 1903, the daughter of Margaret Ann Clarkson (nee Hunter) and Percy Wise Clarkson, Taihape's first Anglican vicar. She was educated at Taihape School and the Diocesan High School for Girls (in Auckland). In 1921 she began her medical studies at the University of Otago, graduating MB, ChB in 1925. As a house surgeon in Dunedin she was a pupil of Henry Pickerill who was dean of the University of Otago Dental School, a pioneering plastic surgeon, and facial and jaw surgeon at Dunedin Hospital. In 1927 Henry left Dunedin to take up a post at the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney, where Cecily joined him to assist and train in plastic surgery. In 1934 she married Henry, who was 27 years her senior. Soon after they returned to Wellington. In 1939 they opened the Bassam Hospital in Bloomfield Terrace, Lower Hutt, a private hospital for infants needing plastic surgery for cleft palates, hare lips, hypospadias, syndactylism, burn scars and birthmarks. Initially Bassam was run as a hostel with the surgery being done at Wellington Hospital, Calvary Hospital (now Wakefield Hospital) or Lewisham Hospital (later the Home of Compassion). By 1942 Bassam was a specialist hospital. Cecily performed all the surgery even though people were mistrustful of female surgeons. She was assisted by women anaesthetists Jessie Burnett, Claudia Shand and Dora Young. Care of infant patients at the Bassam was revolutionary at the time. Mothers roomed in with their infants and Cecily developed the practice of the nurse-mother. Mothers would be responsible for all their child's daily needs except for surgery and changing dressings: making up formula, feeding, bathing, changing nappies (diapers), and taking babies outside. Cecily was able to demonstrate that the nurse-mother was crucial in preventing infections as infants avoided cross- infections which occurred from being handled by multiple nurses or being kept in nurseries. The Pickerills also helped to set up the plastics unit at Middlemore Hospital, travelling to Auckland to work there at the weekends. William Manchester, another New Zealand plastic surgeon, was their registrar. Cecily and her team retired in 1967. Bassam Hospital closed becoming Bloomfield Hospital where she died on 21 July 1988.  Personal life  The Pickerills had one daughter Margaret. In 1935 they purchased three acres of land at Silverstream in Upper Hutt and built a house, Beechdale. The garden was a showplace for rhododendrons and camellias.  Awards and honours  Pickerill became a member of the British Association of Plastic Surgeons (MBAPS) in 1949 and a life member of the Wellington branch of the New Zealand Medical Women's Association in 1972‚Äì1973. She was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1958 Queen's Birthday Honours, for services in the field of plastic surgery. In the 1977 Queen's Silver Jubilee and Birthday Honours, she was promoted to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for services to medicine, especially in the field of plastic surgery.

Pickerill made major contributions to several fields of dentistry and medicine both in New Zealand and overseas. Early life Pickerill, known to his family as Percy was born in Hereford, Herefordshire, England, on 3 August 1879, the oldest child of Thomas Pickerill and Mary Ann Gurney. His father was at the time a commercial clerk and was later the managing director of the Lugwardine Tile Works which made porcelain tiles. Pickerill attended Chandos School, the private Collegiate School of Hereford and then Hereford County College.Meikle, p. 32. Upon completing his secondary education he enrolled at the University of Birmingham in 1900 with the intention of studying dentistry and medicine. He was awarded a LDSRCS (licentiate in dental surgery of the Royal College of Surgeons of England) in 1903 and a BDS in 1904. The University of Birmingham was the first university in Great Britain to offer a BDS degree and Pickerill became the first graduate from this programme. Taking advantage of the dental and medical degrees sharing common courses, Pickerill was able to graduate with a MBChB in 1905. Upon graduating Pickerill worked in a dental practice in Hereford and as a clinical demonstrator in the dental department of the General Hospital in Birmingham. In 1906 he was appointed a lecturer in dental pathology and histology at the University of Birmingham. In 1906 he married Mabel Knott. In 1906 after seeing an advertisement he applied for and was appointed at the age of 28 to the position of first director of the Dental School at the University of Otago. His submitted CV included a claim that he had attended the University of Oxford. However, there is no record of him having attended the university.Meikle, p. 34. Immigration to New Zealand Entry to the dental profession in New Zealand was restricted to those who had completed a degree or certificate of proficiency in dental surgery. In response, the dental school of the University of Otago was established on 1 July 1907 with a temporary director assisted by 12 honorary dental surgeons. Pickerill reached Dunedin and took up his position in September 1907 on a salary of ¬£500 a year. The first three students started in early 1908 followed by another three in May of the same year. Since its opening the school had no shortage of patients. However the school finances were plagued by a shortage of students and thus income, which was not resolved until a campaign led by acting Dean O.V. Davies led to bursaries covering fees and living costs for dental students that was established in 1917. Service in World War 1 In June 1915 Pickerill received a commission as a territorial captain with the New Zealand Medical Corps. He was transferred to the newly established New Zealand Dental Corps (NZDC) in November 1915. In 1916 Pickerill took leave from his position at the University of Otago to serve overseas with the NZDC, departing New Zealand with the 20th Reinforcements NZEF on the troopship Athenic.Meikle, p. 92. Arriving in England in March 1917 he was posted to the No 2 New Zealand General Hospital (Mount Felix Hospital)Gibb, John \\"Pioneering Otago surgeon remembered,\\" Otago Daily Times. 14 March 2019. Retrieved 14 March 2019. at Walton-on-Thames, with orders to establish a unit for the treatment of jaw and facial injuries. The unit was transferred to the newly opened Queen's Hospital at Sidcup, in 1918. Pickerill was soon operating as a maxillofacial surgeon, gaining a reputation in the fields of facial reconstruction and plastic surgery despite no formal training or qualification in this field.Meikle, p. 94. The end of the war led to Pickerill, the unit, and the remaining 59 patients departing in March 1919 on the SS Tainui to New Zealand, where they established themselves in the Facial and Jaw Department at Dunedin Hospital. In June 1919 Pickerill was recognised for his service by being promoted to lieutenant-colonel and appointed an OBE. Pickerill continued overseeing the long-term care of the unit's patients until December 1921 when, after the closing of the unit, he returned full-time to his position at the Dental School.Meikle, p. 105. Return to New Zealand Resuming his position as dean of the Dental School in 1919, Pickerill found that as the result of the work of O.V. Davies the number of students had increased and dentistry as a university discipline was well established. The existing building was now too small, Pickerill had to overcome a proposal by Auckland interests establish a rival dental school in that city. However he was able to convince the government that the dental school needed to be close to the country's only medical school. Approval for the construction of a new building was given in April 1924, and it opened in June 1926. Pickerill strongly opposed the proposal by Thomas Anderson Hunter to establish a child dental health service which would be staffed by school dental nurses who were to receive just 18 months' training. His efforts failed to prevent the establishment of the New Zealand School Dental Service in 1921. Move to Sydney Pickerill resigned from the University of Otago in 1927 to move to Sydney, where he specialised in plastic surgery. In 1933 he took up a post at the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney as senior plastic surgeon.  Later career  On his return to New Zealand he and his wife Cecily Pickerill settled in Wellington opening Bassam Hospital in Lower Hutt in 1940; the hospital treated children with cleft palates and other conditions needing plastic surgery. He was also a Senior Plastic Surgeon at Wellington Hospital and, with Cecily, established plastic surgery for the Auckland Hospital Board. He retired in 1945. Death Henry Pickerill died at Pinehaven, Upper Hutt, New Zealand on 10 August 1956. His ashes were taken to England by his wife and daughter and scattered from a bridge over the River Wye at Holme Lacy near Hereford. Honours Pickerill was made an OBE in 1919, and a CBE in 1923. Personal life He married Mabel Louise Knott on 19 June 1906 at Birmingham. They had three sons and one daughter. After divorcing Mabel Pickerill, he married Cecily Mary Wise Clarkson who was 27 years his junior, at Sydney on 17 December 1934. They had one daughter, Margaret. Cecily was also a surgeon. She was made a Dame of the British Empire (DBE) in 1977 and died in July 1988.  Publications  Pickerill, H P.

The program was originally classified as a \\"pilot project\\" and given the deadline of September 30, 2012 to prove its feasibility in the Norfolk County region. It was declared a permanent fixture in the region on May 16, 2012 after being deliberated before city council. Owing to its long-term status as a municipal program, Ride Norfolk (and Norfolk County Council) became eligible for nearly $90,000 per annum in gas tax subsidies. It appears to serves as a spiritual successor to the now-defunct Simcoe Coach Lines; which operated in the 1950s and operated to four different communities including the hamlet of Vittoria.All-Time List of Canadian Transit Systems Ontario Communities (L - N) at the University of Manitoba According to a past issue of the Port Dover Maple Leaf newspaper, Ride Norfolk has been approved to continue operations through the end of 2013. All buses operating for Ride Norfolk operate on diesel fuel and were manufactured in 2011 by the Ford Motor Company. Summary Originally, the bus service only traveled to the major communities of Simcoe, Delhi, Port Dover, Port Rowan, and Waterford. It only recently made stops in the smaller communities of St. Williams and Langton. The service officially started in 2011 and was operated by Sharp Bus Lines who also operate the school bus system in the county. Service is from Monday to Friday; with no services on Saturdays, Sundays, on major statutory holidays, or after 6:00 P.M..Ride Norfolk Bus Service information at NorfolkCounty.ca Bus service originally did not travel to any of the major shopping centers, instead making trips to the Norfolk library, the senior citizens' home, the different pharmacies, and the Norfolk General Hospital; a 2012 rerouting of the agency's services now places stops at Simcoe's Wal-Mart and Whitehorse Plaza. However, it is expected that the mass transit program will someday be hooked into a larger regional system of mass transit for the entire Southern Ontario region. The original budget of Norfolk County's mass transit system was finalized at $20,700 ($ with inflation added on); a small contribution to a cleaner future considering that Norfolk County has been without a safe and publicly accessible form of mass transit for many years. One of the negative features discovered by local residents was that a typical Port Dover-Simcoe round trip once had a cost of $12; which made it an expensive proposition for the people who need mass transit services.Make shuttle service more affordable (letter to the editor) at SimcoeReformer.ca While the fare being offered by the local mass transit service at that time was cheaper than typical taxi fares in Norfolk County, it was still more expensive than other mass transit routes in Ontario. As of January 3, 2012, fares were reduced to $2 for a ride on the Simcoe service and $6 for a trip to Simcoe along any of the other routes ($5 if the ticket are purchased in bulk).Official fares at Ride Norfolk It costs Norfolk County council $80/ride for the buses to operate; meaning that they have subsidized for approximately 75% of the transportation costs. Social need As a project to support the social needs of the region, it is projected to help abused women escape their hostile situations without relying on other people for transportation. It might never be profitable in a rural area to conduct mass transit so Ride Norfolk is basically a vital community project. Other rural communities may learn from Norfolk County's precedence and create a bus service catering their residents. There is less money lost on Ride Norfolk than it takes to operate the various ice hockey arenas, swimming pools and baseball diamonds; making Ride Norfolk pay off dividends in the social (but not the financial) department. Terminating the Ride Norfolk program at any time will revert the municipality to the situation of lacking sufficient transportation for those who cannot afford automobiles. Norfolk County's rural nature and lack of public transportation options between the dissolution of the Simcoe Coach Lines services of the 1950s and the adoption of the Ride Norfolk program in the 21st century have traditionally made the automobile the only viable choice for Norfolk County residents in the past. While seniors have depended on reduced fare taxi tokens to get around Simcoe in the past, official encouragement to use Ride Norfolk instead has caused them to terminate the taxi tokens for senior citizens as of May 1, 2013. A significant number of people who live in Norfolk County were born prior to the Second World War and are unaware of the advantages and disadvantages of travelling by bus as opposed to private taxi. Seniors cannot afford to purchase their own vehicles; as the average cost of a budget vehicle starts around $17,000 and gas prices have a tendency to fluctuate between $1.03 a litre and $1.32 a litre.Cost of living in Simcoe, Ontario at Numbeo Unlike a traditional mass transit service like London Transit or Brantford Transit, bus drivers are given total decision making rights as to what roads are used to get from community to community.Freedom to Determine the Bus Route at Ride Norfolk Nearly 20 people a day utilize this bus service as it delivers passengers through the five major communities of Norfolk County. The inadequate bus scheduling for the major town of Simcoe has been seen as a reason not to ride the transit service. The total cost of operations for Norfolk Ride in 2012 was estimated to be nearly $300,000; which is almost the same as every eligible taxpayer paying $150 upfront for the service. This money could put a lot of taxis on the road and hire more people than the bus service. However, the taxi service in the region has been known for being expensive and inconsiderate of the social needs of the lower-income people (particularly retired people, unemployed people, stay-at-home parents and the disabled people who are capable of living independently within the community). By having a bus service for these people instead of having multiple cabs on the road, it would help curb emissions and bring an element of carpooling to people who would otherwise never experience it.

There was a distinct measurable difference in the way North Americans and Japanese perceived the emotion of the central figure of the image, such that for North Americans the perception of the emotion of the central figure was not affected by whether or not the figures in the background showed a congruent emotion. Whereas the Japanese participants were markedly influenced in their judgement of the central figures emotional state depending on the emotional states of the surrounding figure.

She was the first women doctor in private practice and served on numerous community organisations, particularly those concerned with the health and welfare of women and children.  Early life  Platts-Mills was born as Elizabeth Platts in Sandridge, Victoria, Australia in 1868, emigrating with her family to Port Chalmers, New Zealand in 1880. She attended Otago Girls' High School and the University of Otago Medical School, graduating in 1900.  Career  Platts-Mills moved to Wellington in 1901 where she established herself as the country's first woman doctor in private practice. In 1912 the King Edward VII Memorial Children's Hospital was opened at Wellington Hospital. The hospital advertised for 'lady physicians' and Platts-Mills and Dr Agnes Bennett were appointed to the positions. She gave up private practice in 1915 to become the first woman medical officer to the Public Service Commission, with responsibility for the health and welfare of women in the public service. As well as her medical career Platts-Mills served on numerous boards and community organisations, particularly those connected with women and children: Wellington Hospital and Charitable Aid Board, the St John Ambulance, the Plunket Society, the League of Mothers, the Mothers Union, the Women's National Reserve of New Zealand, the YWCA, the Social Hygiene Society and the Independent Order of Oddfellows. She worked for the St John Ambulance as Wellington Divisional Surgeon and was made an officer of the order of St John. She was first president of the Plunket Society in Wellington. Both the Plunket Society and the Social Hygiene Society moved to take practical action on health and social needs from a public health perspective and such groups looked to woman doctors for their professional knowledge and status in dealing with government agencies. Platts-Mills was also very active in her local suburb of Karori, in particular serving the community during the 1918 influenza epidemic. Platts-Mills retired in 1934.  Personal life  Platts-Mills married John Fortescue Wright Mills in 1902. They had two sons and a daughter: E.W. Platts-Mills, John Platts-Mills who became a British Labour Party politician and barrister, and Adah Platts-Mills who was a doctor. She died in Auckland on 1 August 1956.

Biography She was born in County Kilkenny, Ireland in about 1857 as Mary Josephine Crampton. She founded the Women's Social and Political League in Wellington and was its president for many years. Based on her proposals and through lobbying of William Pember Reeves, the Minister of Labour, the Department of Labour established a women's branch. Through political infighting within the organisation, Player resigned the presidency and was replaced by Louisa Seddon, whose objective it was to endorse the increasingly conservative policies of the Liberal Government, which was led by her husband Richard Seddon. Player was from a poor background and struggled to support herself after her husband's death in 1905. She would take on much nursing work where she could live on site, as she and her children would otherwise have been left homeless. After her daughters had married, she lived with some of them. She died by drowning in the Nelson suburb of Atawhai on 5 January 1924 at one of her daughter's homes; the coroner ruled that the death was a suicide due to depression.

Rugby career Susumu Hara began his rugby career in high school, playing for the Agricultural High School in the Isahaya region of Nagasaki. Upon graduating high school, he continued his rugby career in college for Toyo University. After college, he was drafted by the Kintetsu Liners. In 1976, he was elected to represent Japan. Wrestling career International Wrestling Enterprise (1978‚Äì1981) After he finished his rugby career, Susumu Hara was scouted by International Wrestling Enterprise in 1976. After a couple years of training, he finally made his debut on June 23, 1978, against Isamu Teranishi. Shortly after his debut, he went to Stampede Wrestling in Canada, under the name Fighting Hara, where he won his first championship, the Stampede British Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight Championship, defeating Norman Frederick Charles III in July 1978. He would lose the title back to Charles five days later. In October 1978, he would tour Europe with Otto Wanz's Catch Wrestling Association. By December 1978, he returned to Japan and was given the name Ashura Hara by author Akiyuki Nosaka, who happens to be a fan of Hara's. In May 1979, Hara won the WWU World Junior Heavyweight Championship, defeating Mile Zrno. He would be the last holder of that title. In March 1980, he went to New Japan Pro Wrestling in an attempt to capture the WWF Junior Heavyweight Championship from Tatsumi Fujinami, but failed. After the failed attempt, he went to the United States, wrestling for Bill Watts' Mid-South Wrestling. During that time he had bulk up into a heavyweight, which caused the WWU World Junior Heavyweight title to be abandoned at the end of March 1980. Returning to IWE, he teamed up with Mighty Inoue in capturing the IWA World Tag Team Championship in May 1981, defeating Paul Ellering and Terry Latham. Unfortunately, the championships were abandoned upon IWE's closure in August 1981, making him and Inoue the final champions. All Japan Pro Wrestling (1981‚Äì1988) Immediately after IWE's closure, Ashura Hara, Mighty Inoue, Apollo Sugawara, Goro Tsurumi, and Rusher Kimura joined All Japan Pro Wrestling, initially as an IWE stable. He would forge a longtime friendship and partnership with Genichiro Tenryu ever since. On May 3, 1982, his first heavyweight title challenge took place during an interpromotional card with Kintaro Ohki's Korean Wrestling Association in South Korea, Hara unsuccessfully challenging Oki for his All Asia Heavyweight Championship in Gwangju . In February 1983, he and Inoue won the All Asia Tag Team Championship, defeating The Great Kojika and Motoshi Okuma to win the vacant titles. They would hold on to the titles for a year, before vacating the titles due to Inoue's focus on the NWA International Junior Heavyweight Championship. However, Hara got another partner in Takashi Ishikawa and regained the titles, defeating Gerry Morrow and Thomas Ivey to win the vacant titles. He and Ishikawa would hold on to the belts for over eight months, before vacating in October 1984. In October 1986, he teamed up with Super Strong Machine to win his third All Asia Tag Team title, defeating his former All Asia Tag Team championship partners Inoue and Ishikawa. They would hold on to the titles until Super Strong Machine's departure in June 1987 forced Hara to vacate the titles. After vacating the All Asia Tag titles, he reformed his tag team with Tenryu, as well as forming the stable Revolution with Footloose (Samson Fuyuki and Toshiaki Kawada) and Yoshinari Ogawa (Tatsumi Kitahara would join the group upon his debut in April 1988). In September 1987, he and Tenryu won the PWF Tag Team Championship, defeating Austin Idol and Stan Hansen. They would hold onto the titles for over nine months before losing the titles to The Olympics (Jumbo Tsuruta and Yoshiaki Yatsu). He and Tenryu would rebound in August 1988 as they won the newly unified World Tag Team Championship, defeating The Olympics. Unfortunately, they lost the belts back to The Olympics a day later. More bad news struck Hara, as days before the World's Strongest Tag Determination League was about to take place, he was fired from AJPW by Giant Baba for massive gambling debts in November 1988. Toshiaki Kawada would take his place in teaming with Tenryu. Upon his firing, he would take a hiatus. Super World of Sports (1991‚Äì1992) After over two and a half years, Ashura Hara made his triumphant return to the ring for Super World of Sports in August 1991. While in SWS, he would team with Genichiro Tenryu, Samson Fuyuki, and Takashi Ishikawa, as well as WWF Superstar Davey Boy Smith. He and Tenryu teamed up for the SWS World Tag Team Championship tournament, defeating Shinichi Nakano and Tatsumi Kitahara in the semi-finals, before losing to Yoshiaki Yatsu and King Haku in the finals for the vacant titles. Unfortunately, turmoil backstage and money problems led SWS to its demise in June 1992. WAR and retirement (1992‚Äì1994) Upon SWS's closure, Ashura Hara joined Genichiro Tenryu in forming WAR. In late 1992, he, Tenryu, Takashi Ishikawa, and Tatsumi (now Koki) Kitahara were involved in a feud with New Japan's stable Heisei Ishingun, in which The Great Kabuki joined in November 1992. However, despite Kabuki's betrayal, he and his allies had added reinforcements in early 1993, thanks to another NJPW stable, Raging Staff (formerly Blonde Outlaws). By October 1993, Raging Staff had disintegrated, as Tatsutoshi Goto joined Heisei Ishingun. In July 1994, Hara teamed up with Jinsei Shinzaki and John Tenta for a one-night six-man tag team tournament, which he lost to Genichiro Tenryu, Atsushi Onita, and Bam Bam Bigelow in the finals. On October 3, 1994, Hara announced that he was retiring after 16 years in the sport. His last match was held on October 29, in which he lost to close friend and tag team partner Tenryu. Retirement After retiring, Hara became a rugby coach and teacher for various schools, including his alma mater. In 2004, his mother died after suffering a stroke. Death On April 28, 2015, Hara died from pneumonia in a hospital in Isahaya, Nagasaki.

In 2011, he died of a heart attack in Kolkata, West Bengal. Acting career Bibhu Bhattacharya never attended any school. He was acting in studios, when other boys of his age were studying.

He was called Master Bibhu, one of the most prominent child actors in Bengali films and very popular with actors like Jahar Ganguly and Chhabi Biswas.

It shares parts of its grounds with Harrison College and the Headquarters of the Barbados Transport Board. Like some of the island's other national parks, Queen's Park remains a site of historic interest.  History  Queen's Park House, is a two-storey structure, built in 1786 located inside the park. The house was initially used as the residence of the Commander in Chief of the British Garrison when they were permanently stationed in Barbados at St Anne's Fort from 1780 to 1905. In the first year that the house was rented for this purpose it was destroyed by the great hurricane of 1780. Nevertheless, on December 27, 1782 the Crown bought the property from Edward Falkinham and the house was rebuilt two years later. At one time there was a sizable barracks of soldiers in the southern part of the property. When the British Garrison presence's at St. Ann's Fort was phased out in 1905, the Barbados Government then purchased the property and the Adjutant-General's Quarters and leased to the Vestry of St Michael. It was opened as a national park on June 10, 1909. The park was designed by Lady Gilbert Carter, (the same person who designed the gardens at Ilaro Court, the now the official residence of the Prime Minister of Barbados.)  Queen's Park Today  Today the National Conservation Commission (NCC) is responsible for the maintenance of the park. Queen's Park not only boasts of a playground for children but also a gazebo, a Steel Shed, a pool & fountain, beautiful gardens and a sports ground where sports like cricket could be played. It is also the home of one of the only 2 existing baobab trees on the island. The other is located in St Thomas. This massive tree, which is almost 1000 years old, is about 18m in circumference.

Sar means head or front and pech means screw. Hence, the word Sarpech literally means that which is screwed onto the front (of the turban). It was also worn in Persia where it was known as jikka or jiqa () which means crest or tuft and in Turkey it was known as Sorguch which is considered a corrupt form of the Persian word sarpush. In India, dominantly two kinds of turban ornaments exist: Sarpech and Kalgi (ornament).  Origin and etymology  Jadau sarpech (turban ornament), 18th-century In India, various types of Sarpech are found depending on their time of production. Those produced in the 16th and 17th centuries resembled a plume and were worn on the right side of the turban. Their material depended on the occasion. The original 16th-century Sarpech was a single unit; then, in the 18th century, two side units were added. With the 19th century, emphasis on elaborate jewelry increased and there were Sarpech big enough to cover half the turban.  Structure  This is a general description of the Sarpech. The basic structure of a gold Indian Sarpech is flat (hamwar). It is a single sheet of metal with gemstones set in its hollow construction. Designs are usually symmetrical (ba-qarina) and gemstones are set (jadau) on the front (rukh). The backside is exquisitely enameled too but remains hidden from the viewer. Sarpeches with one upward rising unit are known as ek kalangi while those with three projections are called tin kalangi.

He was the first Inspector of Native schools in New Zealand in 1980. Pope was one of the founders of the Polynesian Society and was its president from 1899 to 1900. He was the father of the poet, cricketer and teacher Robert J. Pope Early life James Henry Pope was born in St Helier, Channel Islands in 1837., on 11 September 1837, the son of Jane Dacombe and her husband James Pope, a retired English confectioner who migrated from Hampshire to Jersey in the early 1830s. He was educated privately in Jersey where he became fluent in French before he emigrated to Melbourne, Australia, with his parents in 1852 aged 15, on the \\"Castle Eden\\" and landed at Port Phillip, Melbourne. Pope spent the next five or so years in the Victorian gold diggings, pursuing his studies at the same time. His scholastic efforts were rewarded with the highest attainable honours of the Victorian Denominational School Board. On 22 December 1862, at Ballarat he married Helen Grant Rattray, daughter of the Sexton of the Ballarat Cemetery, in a Presbyterian service: they were to have 12 children; eight boys and four girls; two of the girls dying at an early age. Career Teacher In 1858 he was appointed Headmaster of a large primary school in Ballarat, a position he held until 1863. In 1864 Pope moved to Dunedin, New Zealand to become assistant master at the High School of Otago (later Otago Boys' High School). He was soon respected for his breadth of knowledge, energy and teaching ability. He was large, untidy, apparently vague in manner, and considered to be unconventional in his methods, but he knew everything that went on in the classroom and kept strict order. He was an accomplished linguist, equally at home, it was said, in Greek, Latin, French and German, and well versed in Hebrew. He was an enthusiastic astronomer and botanist and an accomplished musician. Although unassuming, he had the confidence of his colleagues, and was acting Rector of the school from 1868 to 1869. He transferred to the Otago Girls' High School in 1873, where the principal, Margaret Burn, regarded him as her right-hand man. In 1876 Pope went back to Ballarat to become Rector of Ballarat College, but his health broke down after a few months and he resigned and returned to Dunedin to recuperate. There was a staffing disruption at the Girls' High School in 1878 and as one of the steps to restore confidence in the school, Pope was appointed Deputy Principal. He continued to be dogged by ill health, and retired at the end of the year, highly esteemed by staff and students alike. First Inspector of Native Schools After a three-month period as an organising teacher in Taranaki in 1879; in Jan 1880, Pope was appointed to be an organising inspector of the 57 Native schools. This was the first opportunity of the Education Department to exert a direct influence on this branch of the national education system. His role was to supervise the teachers, inspect their work and examine pupils. His title was changed to Inspector of Native Schools in 1885. Popes first task was to draft the native school code which would provide policy guidelines. For that period, the MƒÅori schools were well provided with textbooks, teaching equipment and reference books. School gardens, properly fenced, were developed as model gardens for each village. New species of trees and plants were regularly sent to schools for planting in the school glebe. James Pope became a fluent speaker of MƒÅori and one of the best informed Pakehas of his time on MƒÅori lore and traditions. He won the respect of tribal leaders throughout the country and conferred continually with them to establish schools, keep them in good running order, and ensure that the children of school age attended school regularly. He was known in the villages as \\"Te Popi\\". Writer While in Dunedin he was a regular writer of leaders, articles and astronomy notes for the Evening Star. He is remembered for the reading primers he wrote for the native school pupils and for his reader on MƒÅori health and sanitation, \\"Health for the MƒÅori: A Manual for Use in Native Schools\\", to be used later as a basis for the marae campaigns of ƒÄpirana Ngata, Reweti Kohere and Tahup≈çtiki Wiremu RƒÅtana. Legacy After Pope's retirement as Chief Inspector of Native Schools in December 1903 he was presented with an Illuminated Address and a beautifully carved bookcase by the Teachers of the Native Schools Teacher's Association. Both are now on display in the Old Government Buildings, Wellington, now the home for the Law School of Victoria University, Wellington.

A silver epergne presented by the Officers of the Education Department is now in the care of Rev Moorie Robinson. The history of the telescope owned by Pope is described by He stated that Ida Fownes inherited the instrument when the Fownes bought 34 Kelburn Parade from the widow of Frederick Sidney Pope who had in turn inherited the property and telescope from his father James Henry Pope in 1913. William Renwick in his biography wrote, \\"All references to James Henry Pope mention his modesty, the breadth of his sympathies, the range of his interests and his considerable talents. He was, Reweti Tuhorouta Kohere wrote, 'of a lovable nature and so perfectly transparent that he won your respect and confidence on your first meeting.' He was also one among a handful of men who shaped the direction of public education in this country and left a valued personal stamp on its ethos\\".

His family's house was known for their hospitality, as well as being a centre for local Catholics. He attended the Christian Brothers' Boys' School in Dunedin, and was awarded the Bishop Moran's Scholarship in 1878. He later became a law clerk in the office of Donald Reid in Milton. He was also appointed lieutenant in the Bruce Rifle Volunteers in 1887. From 1889 to 1891 he studied law at the University of Otago, and once he was admitted as a lawyer, he moved to Gore to establish a practice there.  Career  Poppelwell was a liberal in politics, and was invited to stand for Parliament several times. He refused every time, but was elected to the Gore borough council in 1893. In 1895 he was elected mayor of Gore, as well as being elected for the borough council again from 1900 to 1903. He then served as mayor four more times from 1904 to 1931. After he had served as mayor, he was made a justice of the peace. Poppelwell was largely responsible for many public works in the city, including setting aside 200 acres of the undisposed part of Croydon Bush for a public reserve. He was president also of the Southland District Law Society, and in 1935 was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal.  Botany  Poppelwell was also an amateur botanist, and spent some of his free time collecting plants.

Of MƒÅori descent, he identified with the Te Whanau-a-Ruataupare hap≈´ of the Ngati Porou iwi. His pƒÅ was at Te Mawhai on the headland that forms the south head of Tokomaru Bay. In 1865 the Pai MƒÅrire movement (commonly known as Hauhau) was active on the East Coast. Potae opposed the Hauhau and on 18 August 1865 near Tahutahu-po, where the Hauhaus had taken up a position between Tokomaru and Tolago Bay, Potae and 36 warriors fought a large body of Hauhaus at Pakura. Ropata Wahawaha and 90 NgƒÅti Porou warriors were close by and engaged the Hauhaus, who were decisively defeated. About 200 Hauhaus, who were driven out of Tokomaru, made their way by the middle of September 1865 to Waerenga-ƒÅ-hika, which was the Church Missionary Society (CMS) mission station that had been established by the Rev. William Williams in the Poverty Bay district. Potae went to Waerenga- ƒÅ-hika with 30 to 40 of his warriors on 28 September and 30 October to support the colonial government forces ‚Äì Forest Rangers and settler volunteers - who were opposing the Hauhau. In November 1865 an attack by the Hauhau was feared. HMS Esk was sent to fetch Potae, Ropata, and Mokena and 260 NgƒÅti Porou warriors from Tokomaru Bay. They were landed at Poverty Bay on 9 November, and, on the same day, 100 Forest Rangers, under Major Fraser, arrived from Waiapu. The mission at Waerenga-ƒÅ-hika became a battle ground. After the Hauhau were defeated, Te Kooti and his supporters were sent to the Chatham Islands, however they escaped and returned to the East Coast. Fighting began all over again. Potae and his warriors participated in the pursuit of Te Kooti. An expedition, which started from Poverty Bay in June 1871, was divided into four companies of 50 men, each of which could work independently if necessary. The leaders were Potae, Ropata Wahawaha, Captain Porter and Ruka Aratapu. Potae participated in the action on 1 September 1871 when the expedition surrounded Te Kooti's camp at Te Hapua, although Te Kooti escaped.

The first New Zealand-born soldier to reach the rank of lieutenant general, he was Chief of the General Staff of the New Zealand Military Forces from 1941 to 1945. Born in 1890 in Timaru, Puttick served in the Territorial Force prior to the First World War. In August 1914 he was part of the Expeditionary Force that occupied German Samoa. He later served with the New Zealand Rifle Brigade during the Senussi Campaign and on the Western Front. He was commanding the 3rd Battalion of the brigade in March 1918 when he was wounded and later repatriated to New Zealand. Puttick joined the New Zealand Staff Corps in 1919 and held a number of command and staff positions for the next 20 years. During the Second World War, he commanded the 4th Infantry Brigade in the Battle of Greece, for which he was awarded a bar to the Distinguished Service Order he had won in the previous war. Following the Allied evacuation from Greece he commanded the 2nd New Zealand Division during the subsequent Battle of Crete. In September he returned to New Zealand as Chief of General Staff, New Zealand Military Forces, and served in this capacity until late 1945. He retired from the military the following year and died in 1976. Early life The son of a railway worker from London, Edward Puttick was born in Timaru, in South Canterbury. He was educated at Waitaki Boys' High School, after which he joined the Roads Department, as it was then known, as a draughtsman. He joined the newly formed Territorial Force in 1911, serving as a second lieutenant in the 15th (North Auckland) Regiment. The following year he moved to Wellington and was transferred to the 5th (Wellington) Regiment. First World War Following the outbreak of the First World War, Puttick's territorial regiment was designated part of the Samoa Expeditionary Force, which was raised for the Occupation of German Samoa in early August 1914. Now with the rank of captain, he landed at Apia on 29 August. The occupation was achieved without loss of life and he spent the next several months on garrison duty before returning to New Zealand in April 1915. On his return, he volunteered for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) which was then in the Middle East, preparing for the Gallipoli Campaign. On arrival in Egypt, Puttick was posted to the 1st Battalion, New Zealand Rifle Brigade. He commanded 'B' Company of the battalion during the Senussi Campaign from January to February 1916, before being transferred to the 2nd Infantry Brigade of the newly formed New Zealand Division. He was promoted to major and appointed Staff Captain of the brigade, under the command of Brigadier General William Braithwaite. He went with the division to the Western Front in April and remained with the brigade during its settling in period in the Armentieres sector of the front. In July, prior to the start of the Somme Offensive, he was transferred back to the Rifle Brigade, and appointed second-in-command of its 4th Battalion. Puttick fought in the Battle of Flers-Courcelette in mid- September 1916 and was mentioned in despatches for his leadership and support of his battalion commander, Colonel Charles Melvill, immediately following the battle. In December he temporarily commanded the 4th Battalion while Melvill was briefly commander of the 2nd Infantry Brigade. In June 1917 he had an extended period as temporary commander of the battalion when, during the Battle of Messines, Melvill was promoted to command of the 1st Infantry Brigade following the death of its previous commander, Brigadier General Charles Henry Brown. Puttick led the battalion through the Battle of Passchendaele until November 1917 at which time he was given command of the 3rd Battalion, New Zealand Rifle Brigade. Late in the year he was again mentioned in despatches and on 1 January 1918, in recognition of his service in the previous six months, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). On 21 March 1918, the Germans began their Spring Offensive and the New Zealand Division was rushed to plug a gap in the front near Colincamps. On 27 March, Puttick was wounded in the chest while leading his battalion in an action designed to link up with an Australian brigade in the nearby village of H√©buterne. He was evacuated to England for treatment and after recuperating, commanded the New Zealand Rifle Brigade's training camp in Brocton, Staffordshire. However, his wounds were such that he was eventually repatriated to New Zealand at the end of the war. Interwar period Shortly after Puttick's return to New Zealand, he married Irene Lillian Dignan in Auckland. The couple would have three daughters. After being discharged from the NZEF in March 1919, he rejoined the Roads Department. Later that year he applied to join New Zealand's permanent military forces but was declined. He returned to the Roads Department but was seconded to the military in August 1919. A few months later he received a commission in the New Zealand Staff Corps as a major. In 1920, Puttick was appointed commander of the Fiji Expeditionary Force, which had been raised following a request from the Fijian government for military forces to support local police dealing with striking labourers and farmers. The force, numbering about 55 men, was based in Fiji for two months before returning home. He then served in a number of staff positions. He was sent to England for attachment to the War Office and the same year attended the Imperial Defence College in 1937, with the rank of colonel. He was also one of New Zealand's representatives at the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in Westminster Abbey. In 1938 he was appointed as Adjutant General of the New Zealand Military Forces as well as a second term as Quartermaster General, having previously served in this capacity from 1934 to 1936. Second World War Puttick was commanding the Central Military District when the Second World War broke out and, as a skilled administrator, played a key role in the raising of the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF) for service overseas. The 4th Infantry Brigade with Puttick, promoted to temporary brigadier, as its commander was to be the first brigade of the newly formed 2nd New Zealand Division, under the overall command of Major General Bernard Freyberg. The brigade duly departed for the Middle East in January 1940. Puttick oversaw the training of the brigade once it settled in its base in Egypt. In June 1940, Freyberg travelled to England to where the second infantry brigade of the division had been shipped. In his absence, Puttick was temporary commander of the New Zealand forces in Egypt. Anticipating a German invasion of Greece, the division was one of the Allied units transferred to that country. Arriving in April 1941, he led the brigade competently during the Battle of Greece as it retreated from the Aliakmon Line in northern Greece to the Servia Pass and onto the beaches at Porto Rafti from where it was evacuated on 27 April to Crete. He was later awarded a Bar to his DSO for his \\"gallantry and devotion to duty\\" during this period. Lieutenant General Edward Puttick in the Volturno Valley area in Italy, talking with men of the Supply and Petrol Companies, 2nd New Zealand Division, 30 May 1944 On Crete, Puttick was promoted to temporary major general and, following Freyberg's appointment as the commander of Creforce, took over responsibility for the 2nd New Zealand Division. During the Battle of Crete his failure to pressure James Hargest, one of his brigade commanders, to make a counterattack to support the defenders of Maleme airfield resulted in its eventual loss to the Germans. With reinforcements and supplies landed at the airfield the Germans were able to consolidate the tenuous gains made in the opening days of the invasion. Any meaningful chance of the Allies successfully preventing the capture of the island was lost and the survivors of Creforce were eventually evacuated to Egypt. On his return to Egypt, Puttick was offered the opportunity to become Chief of the General Staff, effectively the commander of the New Zealand Military Forces, by the visiting New Zealand prime minister, Peter Fraser. He accepted the role and returned to New Zealand in September 1941. Puttick's focus was on ensuring the manpower of the 2NZEF in North Africa was adequately maintained by reinforcements. In the face of the increasing threat of the Japanese Empire in the Pacific, he also put considerable effort into improving New Zealand's defences. After the Japanese entered the war, he considered the actual threat of invasion to be minimal but continued to encourage improvements in home defence as a means of boosting morale. In April 1942 Puttick was promoted to lieutenant general, the first New Zealand-born soldier to reach this rank. In the 1942 Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). As the war progressed he was faced with the difficulty of juggling resources to maintain both the 2nd New Zealand Division in the Middle East and the 3rd New Zealand Division in the Pacific theatre. Later in the war, he was in favour keeping the 2nd Division in Italy to deal with what he considered to be the greater priority, the defeat of Germany, rather than have it be used against the Japanese. Later life Puttick was succeeded as Chief of the General Staff by Major General Norman Weir in late 1945 and was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1946 New Year Honours. In June 1946, he led the New Zealand contingent at the Victory Parade in London. He retired from the military three months later. In his retirement, Puttick authored one of the volumes of the Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War 1939‚Äì45, a unit history of the 25th Battalion, which was published in 1960. His wife died in 1964 and in his later years, he lived in Raglan, a small seaside town on the west coast of the North Island. He died on 25 July 1976 in Hamilton, survived by his three daughters, and was buried at Karori Cemetery in Wellington with military honours.

It is present in many places as an introduced species and often a noxious weed. It has been called \\"one of the world's worst weeds.\\" Overview This perennial grass spreads via its large, branching rhizomes, which are thick and pointed. The pointed shape of the rhizome tip gives the plant the name torpedograss. The rhizomes creep along the ground or float in water, forming floating mats. They can reach a length of and a soil depth of , and they can form a mat thick. The spreading rhizomes sprout repeatedly to form colonies of stems. The stems are tall,Panicum repens. Grass Manual Treatment. sometimes reaching . They grow erect or bend down. The leaves are stiff and straight, linear in shape, and flat or folded. They are sometimes white in color and waxy in texture. The inflorescence is a loose panicle of branches bearing small spikelets long. Habitat This grass grows throughout the world in tropical and subtropical areas. It was introduced to the United States in seed for forage grasses and probably in ballast water from ships. It was also imported by the United States Department of Agriculture to grow as a forage grass for cattle. It was deliberately planted throughout South Florida and it easily escaped cultivation, eventually becoming \\"one of the most serious weeds in Florida,\\" spreading to more than 70% of the waterways in the state. In Lake Okeechobee, it has invaded more than 16,000 acres of marsh. It displaces native plants,Smith, B., et al. (1993). Factors influencing the efficacy of glyphosate on torpedograss (Panicum repens L.). J Aquat Plant Manage 31 199‚Äì202. growing colonially in thick, monotypic stands. Dense mats or stands of the grass cause hypoxia in the water. Torpedograss management in flood-control systems costs an estimated US$2 million per year. The plant is established in sandy coastal habitat on the United States' Gulf Coast, such as beaches and dunes, from Florida to Texas, where it occurs with beach plants such as turtleweed (Batis maritima), saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), marsh fimbry (Fimbristylis castanea), largeleaf pennywort (Hydrocotyle bonariensis), and dwarf saltwort (Salicornia bigelovii). It grows on many barrier islands. It grows in many types of wetland habitat, in and out of the water. It grows in freshwater marshes, salt marshes, mud flats, wet prairies, tide pools, bogs, and lakesides. It also invades drier habitat, such as coastal pine forests and white sand scrub. It easily moves into disturbed and cultivated areas such as ditches and canals. It is a nuisance in sod production. In Hawaii, it is a weed of sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum). In other areas, it can be found in turf and orchards. In the Florida turfgrass industry, it is the second-worst weed known.Stephenson, D. O., et al. (2006). Control of torpedograss (Panicum repens) with trifloxysulfuron-sodium in bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon x Cynodon transvaalensis) turf. Weed Technology 20(2) 351-55. The grass can grow in a variety of habitats, but it does not tolerate cold and it is rarely found above subtropical latitudes or at altitude. Propagation The grass spreads primarily via its rhizome. It has been noted to grow in length per day. The stems and rhizomes also produce tillers. The rhizome can endure drying and flooding. Dry or wet conditions may reduce the number of shoots produced by the rhizome, but they do not kill it. The rhizome can disperse when parts of it break off and drop onto the substrate elsewhere, anchoring and putting up new shoots. The plant survives and sprouts after herbicide application, grazing, cutting, plowing or disking, and burning. The grass rarely reproduces by seed. It has been noted to reproduce by seed in Portugal, but does not do so in the United States,Busey, P. (2003).

Seeds are sometimes observed but they are apparently rarely viable, with many studies describing zero germination. The grass has been widely planted as forage for cattle because it is so hardy, withstanding grazing and trampling, and it can be made into hay. However, it is not one of the more palatable or nutritious grasses. It is also good for erosion control because it binds the soil. Indeed, it is still recommended for planting along shorelines to stabilize them.Torpedograss Panicum repens L. USDA NRCS Plant Guide.

Spying career Shlykov was arrested in Switzerland in January 1983 following his betrayal by Dieter Gerhardt under U.S. Central Intelligence Agency interrogation. Gerhardt was a South African national who spied for the Soviet Union for 20 years before his position was compromised by the Farewell Dossier. Shlykov was arrested when he travelled to Zurich under the false name Nikolaev Mikhail Vasilyevich to meet with Gerhardt's wife, Ruth, who acted as a courier. Despite not disclosing his real name or any other details to Swiss authorities, he was jailed for three years for spying for the Soviet Union. After his release from prison in 1986, he started the Council for Foreign and Defence Policy, an influential think tank that provides advice to the Kremlin on security issues. He later rose to the position of deputy minister of defence in the Russian Federation under Boris Yeltsin. Analysis of the demise of the Soviet Union Shlykov argued with his superiors that the Soviet Union was basing its military and economic policies on faulty assumptions, inherited from the Joseph Stalin era. Namely, he posited that the Soviet war plans were based on the assumption that the upcoming military conflict between the USSR and NATO would strategically and technologically resemble World War II. To prepare for this contingency, it was planned to mobilize between 4 and 8 million soldiers and to continuously supply them with enormous quantities of material: tanks, cannon, planes etc., since it was expected that the materiel (and the soldiers) would be constantly attributed at a high rate. Therefore, most industrial plants in the USSR were required to set aside significant production capacities during peacetime, in order to \\"mobilize\\" them when war broke out and to produce the requisite enormous quantities of war materiel. This had the effect of severely undermining the Soviet economy. Shlykov argued that the assumption that World War III would resemble World War II was wrong and that the above-described approach was ruining the Soviet economy without actually preparing it for possible future conflicts. He pointed out that the Western powers opted out of the World War II-era approach and were actively developing \\"smart\\" weapons in order to counter the Soviet preponderance in manpower and classical materiel. For his efforts he was summarily dismissed from the Soviet Army. He later published his arguments after the fall of the Soviet Union in the open press.

Lidin, Nordic Institute of Asian Studies, NIAS Press, 2002 P.1-14 Tanegashima were used by the samurai class and their ashigaru \\"foot soldiers\\", and within a few years the introduction of the tanegashima in battle changed the way war was fought in Japan forever. History Origins The tanegashima seems to have been based on snap matchlocks that were produced in Portuguese Malacca, at the armory of Malacca, a colony of Portugal since 1511, called an istinggar in Malay. The name tanegashima came from the Japanese island (Tanegashima) where a Chinese junk with Portuguese adventurers on board was driven to anchor by a storm in 1543. The lord of the Japanese island, Tanegashima Tokitaka (1528‚Äì1579), purchased two matchlock muskets from the Portuguese and put a swordsmith to work copying the matchlock barrel and firing mechanism. The smith, Yaita, did not have much of a problem with most of the gun but \\"drilling the barrel helically so that the screw (bisen bolt) could be tightly inserted\\" was a major problem as this \\"technique did not apparently exist in Japan until this time.\\" The Portuguese fixed their ship and left the island and only in the next year when a Portuguese blacksmith was brought back to Japan was the problem solved. Within ten years of its introduction, over 300,000 tanegashima firearms were reported to have been manufactured. Sengoku period Ashigaru using tanegashima from behind wooden pavises. Much of Japan was involved with internecine wars during the Sengoku period (1467-1603), as feudal lords vied for supremacy.Perrin p.9 Matchlock guns were introduced midway through the period and saw extensive use in the later years of the conflict, playing a decisive role on the battlefield. In 1549, Oda Nobunaga ordered 500 guns to be produced for his armies at a time when the benefits of firearms over traditional weapons were still relatively questionable to other daimy≈çs. However the new firearm had undoubted advantages in range in comparison with traditional bows. In addition, bullets could penetrate almost any armor and shield.Andrade, Tonio. (2016) The Gunpowder Age p. 184: \\"When [our] soldiers are lined up against the enemy ranks, our arrows do not reach the enemy while their musket balls rain down upon us.\\" Joseon official Ryu Seong-ryong quoted: But a significant drawback was the high price of each musket and the long production time. Ryu Seong-ryong: The Japanese soon worked on various techniques to improve the effectiveness of their guns. They developed a staggered firing technique to create a continuous rain of bullets on the enemy.Perrin p.17 They also developed larger caliber barrels and ammunition to increase lethality. Protective boxes in lacquerware were invented to fit over the firing mechanism so it could still fire while it was raining,Perrin, p.18 as were systems to accurately fire weapons at night by keeping fixed angles thanks to measured strings.Perrin, p.40 Another development would be the hayago, a bamboo cartridge used to facilitate faster reloading. A hollow tube open on the both ends, the hayago contained gun powder, wadding, and a bullet. Upon tearing open the tube's paper seal at the bottom, a soldier could quickly use it to pour the necessary powder into his weapon before placing over the barrel and using his rammer to load both wadding and bullet into the barrel at the same time. After use, the hayago could be kept for repacking or discarded. Various antique tanegashima In 1563 the Amago clan of Izumo Province won a victory over the Kikkawa clan with 33 of their adversaries wounded by tanegashima. In 1567, Takeda Shingen announced that, \\"Hereafter, the guns will be the most important arms, therefore decrease the number of spears per unit, and have your most capable men carry guns\\".Perrin, p.17 Oda Nobunaga used tanegashima in the Battle of Anegawa (1570), and again against the powerful Takeda clan in the Battle of Nagashino (1575), 3,000 gunners helped win the battle, firing by volleys of a thousand at a time. They were concealed across a river and used breastworks to effectively stop enemy infantry and cavalry charges while being protected.Perrin p.19-20 The defeat of the powerful Takeda clan brought about permanent changes in battle tactics. Japan became so enthusiastic about the new weapons that it possibly overtook every European country in absolute numbers produced.Perrin p.25 Japan also used the guns in the Japanese invasion of Korea in 1592, in which about a quarter of the invasion force of 160,000 were gunners.Perrin p.27 They were extremely successful at first and managed to capture Seoul just 18 days after their landing at Busan.Perrin p.28 Edo period Antique Japanese samurai tanegashima pistol reenactors in Japan Reenactors with Tanegashima at Himeji Castle Festival The internal war for control of Japan was won by Tokugawa Ieyasu, who defeated his rivals at the Battle of Sekigahara in October 1600. Three years later, he established the Tokugawa shogunate, a powerful entity that would maintain peace, stability, and prosperity in Japan for the following 250 years. This is known as the Edo period (1603‚Äì1868). From the mid 17th century, Japan decided to close itself to interaction with the West except for the Dutch Republic through its policy of Sakoku. Contrary to popular belief, this did not lead to Japan \\"giving up the gun.\\" If anything, the gun was used less frequently because the Edo Period did not have many large-scale conflicts in which a gun would be of use. Often the sword was simply the more practical weapon in the average small-scale conflicts. Isolation did not eliminate the production of guns in Japan‚Äîon the contrary, there is evidence of around 200 gunsmiths in Japan by the end of the Edo Period.Samurai Archives Podcast EP05 \\"The Myth of Samurai Giving Up the Gun\\". Retrieved August 13, 2013. But the social life of firearms had changed: as the historian David L. Howell has argued, for many in Japanese society, the gun had become less a weapon than a farm implement for scaring off animals. With no external enemies for over 200 years, tanegashima were mainly used by samurai for hunting and target practice, the majority were relegated to the arms store houses of the daimy≈çs. The arrival in Japan of the United States Navy led by Matthew C. Perry in 1854 started a period of rearmament. The tanegashima was an antiquated weapon by the 1800s and various samurai factions acquired advanced firearms including the mini√© rifle, breech-loading and repeating rifles. The samurai era ended in 1868 with the Meiji; Japan turned to a national conscription army with modern weapons and uniforms. Some gunsmiths did replace their matchlock-type tanegashimas into percussion cap mechanisms while retaining its design as a musket. The last use of samurai armour and traditional weapons in Japan, including tanegashima, was during the Satsuma Rebellion (1877), when the Meiji government's newly established Imperial Japanese Army put an end to the last samurai and their resistance to modernization. Modern use Today tanegashima are readily available from sellers of antique firearms and dealers of samurai antiques both in Japan and the West. Modern tanegashima gun troops in Japan re-enact the use of tanegashima in battle and black powder enthusiasts use tanegashima for target practice.http://www.gunsamurai.com Parts *Shiba-hikigane ‚Äì Butt Protector *Hikigane ‚Äì Trigger *Karakuri ‚Äì Lock *Jiita ‚Äì Plate *Yuojintetsu ‚Äì Trigger Guard *Biyu ‚Äì Rivet *Hinawa Toushi Ana ‚Äì Hole for the Matchcord *Hajiki Gane ‚Äì Spring *Dugane ‚Äì Stock Ring *Hibasami ‚Äì Hammer Arm *Amaoi ‚Äì Barrel Protector *Hibuta ‚Äì Pancover *Hizara ‚Äì Pantray *Dai ‚Äì Stock *Tsutsu ‚Äì Barrel *Moto Maete ‚Äì Rear Sight *Udenuki ‚Äì Sling Hole *Naka Maete ‚Äì Middle Sight *Mekugi Ana ‚Äì Pin Hole *Saki Maete ‚Äì Front Sight *Karuka ‚Äì Ramrod *Suguchi ‚Äì Muzzle Gallery File:Tanegashima.JPG|Edo-period Tanegashima firing mechanism File:Antique Japanese (samurai) tamegashima (matchlock) firing mechanism.JPG|The inside of the arquebus's firing mechanism File:Choshu tanegashima 3.JPG|Edo-period tanegashima showing the barrel bolt File:Choshu tanegashima.JPG|Edo-period tanegashima firing mechanism See also *Nanban trade period References Further reading * Tanegashima: the arrival of Europe in Japan, Olof G.

She was the daughter of Godred Olafsson, King of the Isles, a member of the Crovan dynasty. In the late 12th century she married John de Courcy. Affrica is noted for religious patronage in northern Ireland. Family background Affreca was the daughter of Godred Olafsson (, a member of the Crovan dynasty. Godred ruled the Kingdom of the Isles. Anglo-Norman Ireland A significant era in the history of Ireland was the Norman invasion of Ireland by English or Anglo-Norman adventurers in 12th century Gaelic Ireland.Flanagan 2005: pp. 17-19. In 1166, the once powerful King of Leinster, Dermot MacMurrough (d. 1171), was forced from Ireland by his rivals. With the consent of Henry, Mac Murchada sought the aid of Henry's vassals in Wales and England. Through his daughter Aoife MacMurrough (fl. 1189), Mac Murchada gained a matrimonial-alliance with the powerful Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (d. 1176). In 1167, the reinforced Mac Murchada made his return and easily regained Leinster, and later gained further lands.Flanagan 2004a. See also: Flanagan 2004c. One of the wealthiest and coveted settlements in 12th century Ireland was Dublin, a seaport and seat of a somewhat independent kingdom ruled by various Norse-Gaelic kings.Downham 2007: pp. 33-34, 39. In September 1170, the forces of Mac Murchada and de Clare marched on Dublin, which was then successfully stormed by de Clare's men. According to the near contemporary Expugnatio Hibernica by Gerald of Wales (d. 1220x23), the leadership of the Dubliners managed to escape the carnage with their belongings, and sailed away into the Isles.McDonald 2007: p. 124.

Gerald's account and a mediaeval French text popularly known as The Song of Dermot and the Earl state that, about six months later, the deposed King of Dublin, Ascall mac Ragnaill (d. 1171), launched a sea-borne assault on the town with a force that numbered either sixty or one hundred ships respectively. Although Mac Turcaill's men successfully made landfall near the town, the sources indicate that his forces were utterly crushed by the Norman defenders, and that he was himself captured and beheaded.McDonald 2007: p. 124.

In Gerald's version of the events, Affreca's father supplied thirty ships to an unsuccessful later-attempt at ousting the Normans from Dublin. In the words of Gerald, \\"their fear of the threat of English domination, inspired by the successes of the English, made the men of the isles act all the more quickly, and with the wind in the northwest they immediately sailed about thirty ships full of warriors into the harbour of the Liffey\\".McDonald 2007: p. 124.

With the conquest of Norse-Gaelic Dublin, and the ongoing entrenchment of the English in Ireland, the Crovan dynasty found themselves surrounded by a potentially threatening, rising power in the Irish Sea zone.McDonald 2007: pp. 124-125\\\\. See also: Duffy 1992: p. 133. The dynasty did not take long to realign itself with this new power, in the form of a dynastic marriage between Affreca and one of the most powerful of the incoming Englishmen‚ÄîJohn de Courcy (d. c. 1219).McDonald 2007: p. 125. See also: Duffy 2004a. Marriage to de Courcy Nothing is known of de Courcy's early life. He arrived in Ireland in 1176, with Henry's deputy in Ireland, William fitz Audelin (d. before 1198), and was a member of the English garrison of Dublin.Duffy 2004a. See also: Flanagan 2004d. According to the Gerald, de Courcy led an invasion of Ulaid in 1177 (an area roughly encompassing what is today County Antrim and County Down). He reached Down (modern day Downpatrick), drove off Ruaidr√≠ Mac Duinn Sl√©ibe, King of Ulaid (d. 1201),Duffy 2004a. See also: . This webpage is a partial transcription of: . and consolidated his conquest of the area with the erection of a castle.Woolf 2005: p. 493. See also: Duffy 2004a. He thereafter ruled his lands with a certain amount of independence for about a quarter of a century.Crooks 2005: p. 496. According to the Dublin Annals of Inisfallen, the marriage between Affreca and de Courcy took place in 1180. Although scholars consider these annals particularly unreliable,McDonald 2007: p. 126. See also: Duffy 2004a. a date of about 1180 may not be far off the mark, considering the time-frame of de Courcy's rapid rise to power.McDonald 2007: p. 126. It is possible that de Courcy's marriage could have attributed to his success in Ulaid, considering the military resources of the Crovan dynasty. Less speculative is the likelihood that de Courcy's success was used by the Crovan dynasty, who were allied by marriage with Cen√©l nE√≥gain, as a means of settling old scores.McDonald 2007: pp. 126-127. John and R«´gnvaldr In a series of conflicts between 1201 and 1204, de Courcy finally fell from power. By 1205 he was forced from Ireland altogether, and his lands were awarded to Hugh de Lacy, 1st Earl of Ulster (d. 1242). Sometime in 1205, de Courcy rose in rebellion, and gained military support from Affreca's brother, Ragnvald Godredsson (), King of the Isles.McDonald 2007: pp. 128-127\\\\. See also: Smith 2004. The Chronicle of Mann specifies that de Courcy's massive force was further strengthened by R√∂gnvaldr with one hundred ships. Together the two laid siege to what the chronicle describes as \\"the castle of Rath\\", before being beaten back with the arrival of Walter de Lacy (d. 1241), Hugh's elder brother.McDonald 2007: p. 128. See also: Flanagan 2004b. See also: Anderson 1922: pp. 364-365\\\\. See also: Munch; Goss 1874: pp. 80-83. The expedition is also recorded in the Annals of Loch C√©, which state that de Courcy brought a fleet from the Isles to battle the de Lacys. Although the expedition ultimately proved a failure, the annals note that the surrounding countryside was plundered and destroyed by the invaders.McDonald 2007: pp. 128-127\\\\. See also: Hennessy 1871: pp. 234-235. The identity of the castle noted by the chronicle is almost certainly Dundrum Castle, which was possibly constructed by de Courcy before 1203. The defeat of 1205 marks the downfall of de Courcy, who never regained his Irish-lands.McDonald 2007: p. 129. Religious patronage Affreca founded in 1193 Grey Abbey, in the peninsula of Ards, where John had previously given lands to his family priory, St Andrew of Stogursey.

He is director of the Center for Risk Management Research, University of California, Berkeley and he was chair of the University of California Academic Senate 2011-12. He is also the Co-Director for the Consortium for Data Analytics in Risk at UC Berkeley. Research Anderson‚Äôs nonstandard construction of Brownian motion is a single object which, when viewed from a nonstandard perspective, has all the formal properties of a discrete random walk; however, when viewed from a measure-theoretic perspective, it is a standard Brownian motion. This permits a pathwise definition of the It√¥ Integral and pathwise solutions of stochastic differential equations. Anderson‚Äôs contributions to mathematical economics are primarily within General Equilibrium Theory. Some of this work uses nonstandard analysis, but much of it provides simple elementary treatments that generalize work that had originally been done using sophisticated mathematical machinery. The best known of these papers is the 1978 Econometrica article cited, which establishes by elementary means a very general theorem on the cores of exchange economies. In the 2008 Econometrica article cited, Anderson and Raimondo provide the first satisfactory proof of existence of equilibrium in a continuous-time securities market with more than one agent. The paper also provides a convergence theorem relating the equilibria of discrete-time securities markets to those of continuous-time securities markets. It uses Anderson‚Äôs nonstandard construction of Brownian and properties of real analytic functions. Recently, Anderson has focused on the analysis of investment strategies, and his work relies on both theoretical considerations and empirical analysis. In an article published in the Financial Analysts Journal in 2012 and cited below, Anderson, Bianchi and Goldberg found that long-term returns to risk parity strategies, which have acquired tens of billions of dollars in assets under management in the wake of the global financial crisis, are not materially different from the returns to more transparent strategies once realistic financing and trading costs are taken into account; they do well in some periods and poorly in others. A subsequent investigation by the same research team found that returns to dynamically levered strategies such as risk parity are highly unpredictable due to high sensitivity of strategy performance to a key risk factor: the co- movement of leverage with return to the underlying portfolio that is levered.

Both his parents were 'Recorded Ministers' of the Society of Friends. He had little formal education but used his time off from working in his father's shop to read and to write essays on religious and moral problems, as well as composing poetry. He determined that he should devote his energies to 'the honour of advocating peace'. In his view war was \\"an evil before which, in my estimation, slavery sinks into insignificance\\". In 1825 he attended the annual meeting of the Peace Society in London and went on to help set up a branch of that society in Exeter. He soon had to withdraw from taking an active part due to his failing health.  Works  Three works by Dymond have been published, two during his lifetime, the Inquiry and the Observations, and one posthumously, the Essays. A collection of his published and unpublished letters, poems and writings was made in 1911 by Charles William Dymond. # An inquiry into the Accordancy of War with the Principles of Christianity, and an Examination of the Philosophical Reasoning by which it is defended: with Observations on Some of the Causes of War and Some of Its Effects. 1823 in England [Philadelphia 1834] [British Library 001023068] # Observations on the Applicability of the Pacifist Principles of the New Testament on the Conduct of States, and on the Limitations which those principles impose on the Rights of Self-defence.

He saw armies as enemies of liberty and physical and moral subjection as a necessary condition of army life. The opinion he voiced prefigures some of the later objections to conscription made by Quakers and other conscientious objectors.

The film features Saif Ali Khan, Kunal Khemu, Vir Das, Puja Gupta and Anand Tiwari. It was released on 10 May 2013.Go Goa Gone. Box Office India Almost one third of the film was shot in Mauritius. Go Goa Gone became successful at the box office and a sequel titled Go Goa Gone 2 is scheduled for release in March 2021.  Plot  Hardik (Kunal Khemu) and Luv (Vir Das) are two dope-heads, living with their roommate/friend Bunny (Anand Tiwari). After Hardik loses his job and Luv gets dumped by his girlfriend, both decide to tag along with Bunny to Goa to relax. In Goa, Luv falls for Luna (Puja Gupta), and she invites the guys to a rave party, organised by the Russian mafia, which is being held on a secluded island. At the party a new drug, D2RF, is launched. None of the friends take it as it's very expensive. The next morning, the three roommates find that the island has been infected by zombies, and the three men save Luna from her villa and stay together in hopes of surviving. A Russian mafioso, Boris (Saif Ali Khan, originally from Delhi/Dilli), arrives and reveals himself as a zombie slayer. Boris, his partner Nikolai, the three boys and Luna plan to use the boat they had used to travel to the island to escape from it. Finally, after escaping the forest, they discover that the mainland has also been infested by the zombies, forcing them to find another way to survive. Boris tells them the boat will come back to the original place due to cyclic nature of water currents. However the boat has been taken by a zombie. They find a home fully vacant and decide to stay there. Boris leaves the four of them in the house saying he has important work with Nikolai. At night after Boris leaves, the zombies find the house and attack the four of them. They run away from the zombies and reach the rave party area looking for food. There, too, they are attacked by zombies. Bunny gets trapped in a tent and is seemingly killed by zombies. The three manage to escape with the help of Boris and Nikolai: who arrive just in time. On the way Nicolai gets bitten by a zombie so he stays behind in the forest. The four are grief-stricken. Luna realises Boris had gone back to obtain his expensive Cocaine. Whilst waiting for the boat to arrive, Hardik gets a call from Bunny saying he's alive and on top of a tower. The four of them go to rescue him where Boris is surrounded by the zombies and the four youngsters escape. When they reach Boris's jeep, Bunny tells them that he threw cocaine at the zombies which were coming to attack him. The mixing of the red pill and cocaine made them still. They go back to save Boris, and throw the cocaine packets towards the sky and ask Boris to shoot it. This trick works and all the zombies come to a stand still. They leave the island coming to a conclusion that \\"Drugs fuck you up\\". When they arrive at the shore of Goa, they see that the settlement is burning and everything is damaged. All five take their guns out and the movie ends there on the note ‚Äì \\"The End..is near\\", signalling a zombie apocalypse.

Kunal Khemu was associated with the film writing, and it was his idea to get Saif Ali Khan on board. The initial idea for the film was to make a crime comedy genre film, but then a zombie comedy was eventually finalised.  Promotion  The film was publicised as India's first \\"Zom-Com\\". The Volkswagen Polo used in the film was selected from a car audition named \\"My Car Superstar!\\" in association with Volkswagen India.  Soundtrack  The music was composed by the duo Sachin‚ÄìJigar. The lyrics were written by Priya Panchal and Amitabh Bhattacharya, and songs feature the voices of Jigar Saraiya, Talia Bentson, Sachin Sanghvi, Priya Panchal, and Shreya Ghoshal.  Critical reception  The film received mixed reviews from critics and has gathered a cult status in horror comedy. Piyasree Dasgupta of Firstpost noted that \\"Go Goa Gone works in a manner similar to why Delhi Belly did\\" commending it for its \\"superb pace\\" and \\"smart editing\\". Lisa Tsering of The Hollywood Reporter stated that \\"the film starts out promisingly\\" calling its soundtrack \\"infectious\\" while also criticising its screenplay for \\"fizzling out halfway through\\". Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the movie 3.5/5 stars and stated that \\"On the whole, GO GOA GONE is experimental since something like this has never been attempted earlier. But it‚Äôs fun, witty, amusing and yes, thoroughly entertaining\\". Meena Iyer of Times of India gave it 3 out of 5 stars and said \\"Go Goa Gone is positively different from anything you have seen before. And for the young and restless or even those who like whacked-out fun, it‚Äôs a great ride.\\". Namrata Joshi of Outlook rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and summarised by saying \\"It's fun, sharp, smart and irreverant. Go Goa Gone pushes many of our sanctimonious envelopes.\\" Rajeev Masand gave the film a 3/5 rating and wrote, \\"So much in this film is good, until it all goes nowhere in the end.\\" Shubir Rishi of Rediff.com gave it 2.5/5 stars and said \\"Go Goa Gone\\" is a fun watch. There are plenty of innocent-sounding, slow-exploding one-liners, which are funny\\". Anupama Chopra of Hindustan Times gave it 2.5 out of 5 stars stating that, \\"The problem with Go Goa Gone is too much cleverness and not enough plot. Shubhra Gupta The Indian Express rated the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, \\"The film would have been funnier if the second act hadn't gone into a slide.

One of his first releases, \\"In-Ten-Si-T\\" (1988), which was co-written and produced by Jim \\"Cheese\\" Romano, is considered[2] one of the Top 10 most influential House music records.[3] In 1987, he produced \\"Never Let Go\\", which became a hit. Oliver's works continue to be remixed and re-released through producers/artists all over the world.[4][5] In 2011, Oliver charted on Billboard Magazine's Dance Music Club Play chart with his single release \\"As Days Go By\\" featuring Baton Rouge (LA) singer Kim Smith on the Intensi-T label. The song debuted at #46 on the chart on January 22, 2011 and peaked at #16. That chart success seemed to remind the dance music industry of Oliver's abilities as it opened the door to more remixing opportunities. Oliver remixed the single \\"Zoon Baloomba\\" which topped out on the Billboard chart at #21 on November 18, 2012. In the year 2010 Mickey Oliver debuted his Las Vegas Theatrical show, Intensit-T at the Planet Hollywood complex on the Vegas strip. Starring in this Dance Revue variety show, Intensit-T showcased how House Music influenced other genres of music. In that same year Mickey also produced and starred on an ABC Las Vegas TV show called Intensi-T TV. This 10-episode entertainment/variety show premiered after the desperate housewives series and later after the Jimmy Kimmel show. Intensit-T TV uncovered the Las Vegas culture as well as had a weekly sketch comedy routine. The show and garnered an underground fan club and still today in 2019 can be seen on Roku on demand. Today, Mickey Oliver is producing a lighthearted musical called \\"Revolution Chicago\\" which is the story of how House Music grew out from the streets of Chicago into a worldwide lifestyle. Revolution Chicago is set to premiere in September 2019. Oliver continues to work as a DJ, producer, remixer and television show creator.

He is the current governor for Madang Province. Previously he was Member of Parliament for Usino Bundi between 1994‚Äì1997 and 2002-2007. In 2003 he succeeded Peter O'Neill as the Minister of Labour and Industrial Relations under Prime Minister Michael Somare. Prior to this, he was appointed Minister for Transport and Works in 1996. Yama is the head of Yama Security Services Ltd, which is a subsidiary of his Yama Group of companies. He has an extensive property portfolio and owns the Smugglers Inn hotel in Madang. Controversies Yama was referred to the Public Prosecutor on July 1997 amid allegations of misconduct which included, \\"improper application and failure to acquit EDF and other public funds, conflict of interest, using his position to obtain private a [sic] bank loan and attempting to purchase 2 ships from the government below market price\\". The matter was then referred to a leadership tribunal, which investigates alleged cases of misconduct by ministers and senior public officials, and which recommended the dismissal of Yama from his office in December 2004. This decision was ultimately overturned in February 2005 due to insufficient evidence on the majority of the counts. Yama was, however, fined K1000 for having been biased in his distribution of PGK1.6 million under the Rural Transport Development Program to his then Sumkar electorate. In 2002 Yama issued a complaint against the State for PGK38.7 million, alleging that he had been prevented access to a piece of land leased to him in 1988. Attorney General Zacchary Gelu awarded Yama a PGK15.5 million Deed of Settlement in compensation for lost earnings. However, in 2010 a government Commission of Inquiry found that Yama's claim had been a fraudulent one, as it had failed to comply with mandatory procedural requirements and had been filed in respect of a plot of land that did not exist. The Commission referred Yama for criminal prosecution for making an unlawful claim and ordered that civil action be taken against Yama for unpaid land rentals to the effect of PGK61,015. In December 2009, Yama was awarded PGK7.6 million in a case against Motor Vehicle Insurance Limited for breach of contract. However, Bank of South Pacific (BSP) attempted to secure this money, claiming that Yama had outstanding debts. Yama denied that he had any existing debts with BSP and brought charges of fraud against the bank. Two Australian executives at BSP were subsequently arrested as a consequence of this action. The executives, Robin Fleming and John Maddison, were subsequently released on bail. Australian law firm Gadens Lawyers, which represented BSP in the court action against Yama, were forced to withdraw their involvement in the case following physical threats to their legal team by armed groups in Port Moresby.

It was initially established as the State Nominee to acquire the State and Landowner equity interests in mining and petroleum projects and to manage the equity funds for landowner companies from the major resource development areas of PNG. However, the State's equity has since been transferred to Petromin PNG Holdings Ltd, so the focus of MRDC is now the management of the Landowner equity interests in both mining and petroleum projects. MRDC is governed by a Board of Directors, which is chaired by Isacc Lupari by virtue of his position as 'Chief Secretary' of the State. Since March 2008, the Managing Director of MRDC has been Augustine Mano. In October 2011, Mano's appointment was terminated by acting Prime Minister Belden Namah, upon allegations that the MRDC had made improper investments under his management. However, Mano was reinstated a week later by Prime Minister Peter O'Neill. History The major interests of MRDC were partially privatised in 1996, through the creation of Orogen Minerals Limited (OML), of which the MRDC holds a 51% controlling shareholding. In April 2002, Orogen merged with Oil Search Limited (OSL), but MRDC retained an 18.1% stake in the new company. OSL is PNG's largest oil and gas producer. MRDC was again restructured in 2007, with the formation of Petromin PNG Holdings Limited, which took control of the last State asset, the 20.5% equity interest in the Moran Petroleum Project. As a result of this restructuring, MRDC's chief role became the management of Landowner and Provincial Government interests. Investments and Subsidiaries MRDC's combined group investment portfolio increased from K678.95 million in 2007 to K1,021.7 billion in December 2010.

M. (n.d.) \\"Regulation of Traditional Medicine in the WHO African Region African Health Observatory\\" Villages have been left gripped by fear and bewilderment from such activities. In exposed communities, roadsides posters, workshops, and alert systems have been erected to warn children and their families of the danger posed by witch doctors abducting for the purpose of child sacrifice.  Motive  Witch doctors, who also identify as traditional healers, will consult the spirits for anyone who can pay their fee. The spirits will communicate via them the kind of sacrifice for appeasement that they want. Often these sacrifices are chickens or goats, but when such sacrifices fail to make the client prosper instantly, 'the spirits' will demand human sacrifices.Rogers, C (October 11, 2011). \\"Where child sacrifice is a business\\". BBC News. Witch doctors have multiple reasons for child sacrifice like health, good fortune, and to ward of evil spirits. In most cases, it is a strategy used to give the client an impossible task so that the witchdoctor does not appear to have failed. The witchdoctor is able to gain a lot of wealth by facilitating and carrying out human sacrifices as the fee charged is normally very high. The desire for instant wealth on the part of the client and greed on the part of the witchdoctor has created a ready market for children to be bought and sold at a price. Children have become a commodity of exchange and child sacrifice is more than a religious or cultural issue, it has become a commercial business.  Causes  Children are often victims of sacrifice for various reasons, the most common being they are relatively easy to abduct. As they are far more vulnerable than adults, children are more easily lured in or unable to fight back.Nilsson, Ann-Charlotte. (2013). \\"Children and youth in armed conflict\\". Leiden: Koninklijke Brill. p. 48. Another reason children are abducted is that spiritually they are seen as more 'pure'; a sacrifice that is \\"pure\\" or \\"unblemished\\" is believed to bring better results.Smitheram, E. (March 4, 2014). \\"How one charity is working to prevent child sacrifice in Uganda\\". The Guardian.Kawaawa-Mafigiri, D., & Walakira, E. (2009). \\"Child Abuse and Neglect in Uganda\\" (p. 167). If a child has been circumcised, scarred or has had their ears pricked, this represents disfigurement or impurity and they may be spared from sacrifice. Some parents have marked their children in these ways to protect them. In other cases children are given to witch doctors by relatives out of desperation for money. A child's life is worth a high price and it provides instant money for struggling families. Another cause for children being abducted is the belief that children represent new growing life, and offering them as a sacrifice will bring prosperity and growth to the one procuring the sacrifice.Mbogoni, L. E. (2014).Human sacrifice and the supernatural in African History. Dar-es- Salaam, Tanzania: Mkuki na Nyota Pub. p. 139  Child sacrifice  Generally, a witchdoctor will try other methods first to bring about change of a person's misfortunes or desires using herbal remedies or animal sacrifices.KidsRights Foundation. (2014). \\"No Small Sacrifice Child Sacrifice in Uganda, in a global context of cultural violence\\" When change is not successful, resorting to child sacrifice is proposed because it is believed to be the most powerful. When a child is sacrificed, the witch doctor and his accomplices will generally undertake the whole process.Jubilee Campaign and Kyampisi Childcare Ministries. (2011) \\"Child Sacrifice in Uganda ‚Äì report\\" This includes: the witch-hunt, the abduction, followed by the removal of certain body parts, the making of a potion and lastly if required the discarding of the child's body. The removal of body parts depends on the type of outcome desired. Most commonly heads, limbs, tongues, genitals, eyes, teeth, and organs are removed. The child is usually alive during the removal process. Figures suggest only a very small proportion of children survive.Thomas, G. (2017, March 24). \\"The Country Where Sacrificing Children Is a Thriving Business\\" One type of sacrifice is the removal of blood, which is then used in medicines or mixed with herbs. It will be used in the place where success, healing or wealth is desired. In other cases a child is buried under a building foundation, either dead or alive, or only their hands, feet and genitals to bring good luck to the new building.  Survivors  A child that survives sacrifice is left with traumatizing consequences for the rest of their lives. Most commonly survivors are left with large scars across their body, head and neck in particular. Genital mutilation is also common. Survivors are left with urinary issues and distorted puberty development. The psychological damage to children affects their entire development; victims can struggle to develop ‚Äònormal‚Äô relationships after such an attack. Families are also affected as parents often bear the financial burden of covering short- term or long-term treatment.  Dynamics   Desire for wealth  A study of the Ugandan context shows great disparity between the rich elite and the average Ugandan who struggles to make ends meet. It is almost impossible for someone born in a poor family to climb up on the social ladder. The gap between the rich and the poor combined with discontent with the political status quo, endemic corruption and general feeling that the country has lost direction breeds a lot of discontent and frustration. It is in such an environment that the witchdoctors thrive, promising desperate people a miraculous way to bridge the gap from have-not to have, from failure to success and from poverty to wealth.Whewell, T (January 7, 2010). \\"A BBC investigation into human sacrifice in Uganda\\". Newsnight. BBC. The small elite who gained wealth in a relatively short time during Uganda's economic boom in the early 21st century is an example promoted by witchdoctors for their successful profession. They claim that they have aided many of the nouveau riche to gain their wealth. According to the head of the country's Anti-Human Sacrifice Taskforce, the child sacrifice is directly linked to rising levels of development and prosperity, and an increasing belief that witchcraft can help people get rich quickly. Mike Chibata, the Director of Public Prosecution in Uganda, said that the growing appeal is due to superstition and a desire to get rich quick; witch doctors tell people that child sacrifice is an easy way to achieve great wealth. It is thought that child sacrifice increases the power of a witch doctor's magic because it makes the charms, amulets or talismans that are given to clients stronger. For this reason, witch doctors stay in practice, along with great financial benefit. Angela, P. (January 16, 2010). \\"Uganda Child Sacrifice\\". Interview by T. Whewell. In Our World documentary. BBC News.  Witchdoctors and traditional healers  All witchdoctors identify as traditional healers but not all traditional healers are witchdoctors and most do not perform child sacrifice.Jubilee Campaign and Kyampisi Childcare Ministries. (2011)\\"Child Sacrifice in Uganda ‚Äì report\\" This identification has caused witchcraft to be associated with the healing practices of the indigenous culture, generating a rise in fascination with witchcraft. This has resulted in a damaged reputation of those traditional healers and herbalists who do not use human flesh but are still blamed for these crimes.  Politicians seeking fortune  There is an increased risk of child sacrifice and increased work for witchdoctors around the elections. This is because high-profile Ugandans have bought into the practice by being convinced they need to sacrifice a child to win a seat as an MP.AFP (June 15, 2015). \\"If they're told to win a seat as an MP 'You must sacrifice a child', they'll do it\\"  Case studies   Survivor  BBC news investigated a seven-year-old boy called Allan Ssembatya.Ssembatya, A. (January 16, 2010). \\"Uganda Child Sacrifice\\" Interview by T. Whewell. In Our World documentary. BBC News. He was attacked by a local witchdoctor and two acquaintances on his way home from school while walking with friends. In the witchdoctor's shrine he was struck on the neck, across the shoulders, and in the head with a machete. One of his testicles was removed and he was left for dead in a bush; he survived, but was in a coma for a month. The local witchdoctor admitted to this but the case is still pending due to slow investigation and allegation of corruption. Allan's family had to move homes and jobs to get through the ordeal and there are still adverse effects to this day.  Killed victim  Steven (Emmanuel) Kironde was killed at the age of six in 2009. He was in the care of his grandmother, who left the family home briefly for an errand, when he was abducted. His body was found the next morning decapitated behind the house. The witchdoctor was arrested but three weeks later the police offered a pay out to the grandmother to drop the case. This was declined and further developments have not been made. There are several cases like this in the court system.  Former witchdoctor  Polino Angela gave up this work in 1990; since then he has dedicated his time to converting 2,400 other witchdoctors. He admitted to killing seventy children including his own ten- year-old son in his past. James Nsaba Buturo, the Minister of Ethics and Integrity, agreed with Polino's approach stating persuading change is better than retrospective punishment, which would cause a problem for justice.  Statistics  Statistics of child sacrifice can be hard to accurately gauge in Uganda. The Uganda Human Rights Commission published a report in 2014 that warned of an underestimation of cases.Uganda Human Rights Commission. (2014). \\"Child sacrifice in Uganda and its human rights implications: A research study\\" This was based on late claims and tampering of crime scenes. Over 2007 and 2008 there was an 800% rise in the number of reported ritual sacrifice cases.Bienvenu, M. (2010). \\"Child Sacrifice in Uganda\\" The African Network for the Prevention and Protection against Abuse and Neglect (ANPPCAN) reported that almost 3000 children disappear from their homes every year.ANPPCAN. (2016). \\"The African Network for the Prevention and Protection against Child Abuse and Neglect\\" This is not close to the reported number. A UNICEF report stated 13 cases of child sacrifice were reported in 2014 and 2015 and six of the 2015 ones were related to elections.  Current law   Legislation  There are three pieces of legislation currently governing child sacrifice in Uganda. The most recent of these was the October 2009 Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act; this contained relevant sections on trafficking for the use of body parts.The Republic of Uganda. (2009). \\"The Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act\\" Prior to this there was only the Witchcraft Act of 1957 and the Children's Act 1997.The Republic of Uganda. (1957). \\"The Witchcraft Act\\"The Republic of Uganda. (1997). \\"Children Act\\" Child sacrifice through witchcraft has been allowed because the authorities did not implement the Witchcraft Act on the ground. The Act itself is hard to try anyone under because of its vague expression. Child sacrifice is not specifically mentioned in it. This means that giving a maximum sentence for the murder of a child by sacrifice is extremely difficult and the courts rarely use it. In 2016 an amendment to the Children's Act was passed. Under clause 10 it protects children from violence and provides a right to access child protection services.The Republic of Uganda. (2016.)\\"The Children (Amendment) Act\\" Unicef. (2016). \\"The Children Act Amendment 2016\\" This development specifically prohibits child sacrifice, trafficking, sexual exploitation and female genital mutilation. It also ensures a service for children who have been victims and sets a mandatory structure for reporting abuse.  Anti-Human Sacrifice and Trafficking Task Force  This force was created in 2009 along with the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act. The government established the force with the intention that they would to oversee and coordinate investigations, collect statistics and work with the general public to stop this practice. The Force are covering more cases than law enforcement did before its establishment, but there is still a struggle to gain adequate evidence for convictions. The task force consists of an officer with a motorcycle and it works without a proper budget. Consequently, many Ugandans believe that the gesture of the Ugandan government is more a matter of window dressing to avert local and international criticism than a genuine attempt.  International obligations  Uganda is obliged under multiple treaties to protect the rights of children. The 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child requires Uganda to act in the best interest of the countries children by ensuring they all have basic human rights.United Nations. (1989) \\"Convention on the Rights of the Child\\" Uganda also ratified the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.African Unity. (1987) \\"The African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights\\" Several articles within this charter set out clear obligations to protect human rights. In particular Article 4 and 5 protect everyone's right to life and freedom from bad and cruel treatment. Article 18 specifically identifies the protection for children. This international instrument works to promote and protect basic human freedoms and human rights throughout Africa. Uganda is obliged to fulfill these expectations by continuously establishing state mechanisms to prevent tragedies like child sacrifice.  Awareness  The issue of child sacrifice in Uganda has been highlighted in the media over the past three years with ABC (Australia) and BBC producing compelling reports and documentaries.ABC 2009. -killing/1439848 \\"Men severed albino boy's legs in ritual killing\\" ABC News. (23 September).; BBC 2010. \\"Human sacrifices 'on the rise in Uganda' as witch doctors admit to rituals\\" BBC Investigation quoted in the Telegraph (7 January). The media attention coincided with media campaigns by Ugandan NGOs such as RACHO, ANPPCAN-Uganda, faith-based organisations such as Kyampisi Childcare Ministries (KCM) and Rose's Journey‚Äîa collective effort of Ugandans and friends of Uganda to end child sacrifice. The media attention has put the government of Uganda under pressure to be seen as doing something about the issue of child sacrifice. This resulted in the formation of the official government task force, the new bill, and the 2016 amendment.  Future development  There was previously an issue with the application and implementation of relevant legislation on the ground and in court. To make this change in legislation successful its effects will need to be taught properly to the Task Force, where change can start from the ground. The second area of concern is within the court systems. Cases on child sacrifice currently go straight into the general court system. Cases get held up easily and take a long time to actually go through. A department of court set up to specifically tackle child sacrifice cases would provide a suitable structure for victims and their families. This has been supported by local authorities because it will help simplify the monitoring of activities.

The power station contains pump-generators for two co- located but hydraulically separated power schemes; the Chiotas-Piastra Plant and Rovina-Piastra Plant. Both plants use separate upper reservoirs but use Lago della Piastra as their common lower reservoir. To produce power, water is released from the upper reservoirs to the power station located at the lower reservoir. The pump-generators re-fill the reservoirs and the process repeats as needed. The Chiotas' upper reservoir, Lago del Chiotas, is located much higher in the valley and larger than Rovina's Lago della Rovina which affords it the ability to produce more electricity. The installed capacity of Chiotas is with a hydraulic head (water drop in elevation) of while Rovina has an installed capacity of and a head of . Construction on the plant began in 1962 and operations started in 1982. It is owned and operated by Enel. Design and operation The Piastra Dam and Lago della Piastra The Entracque Power Plant is supported by a scheme that also primarily consists of three reservoirs. The lower reservoir used by both the Chiotas and Rovina is Lago della Piastra. The reservoir is located at the base of the valley and was formed by the construction of an tall gravity dam.

The pumping is carried out by the power station's nine Francis pump turbine-generators, eight belong to Chiotas and one to Rovina. When either of the upper reservoirs needs to be filled, water is pumped from Piastra to the Chiotas or Rovina upper reservoirs through a series of penstocks and tunnels.

She is a graduate of the Korea National University of Arts.  Work  Kim's debut work \\"No Knocking in This House,\\" a short story published in 2003, is about five women living in five separate rooms in a boarding house, where the rooms are tiny and close together. It won Daesan Literary Award. Next, her short story collection, Run, Daddy, Run, entered the spotlight, earning her the Hankook Ilbo Literary Award in 2005. Twenty-five years old at the time of the award, Kim was the youngest award winner ever recorded, which was all the more unprecedented as she was also a new writer who had not yet published any short story collections. In 2008, her short story \\"Knife Marks\\" won the Yi Hyos≈èk Literary Award. Likewise, she was the youngest to ever be awarded this prize. Kim's stories feature young people in their 20s who have moved up to Seoul from other parts of the country. After industrialization and urbanization began in earnest in the 1960s, Korean literature frequently dealt with the subject of young people who turned their backs on their hometowns to come to Seoul. However, though young people continued to move to the capital after the new millennium, literary interest in their stories began to decrease. Because Kim spent most of her childhood growing up in a rural village called Seosan and only began living in Seoul in her 20s, she imbues the lives of the characters in her stories with a strong sense of realism. She originally studied playwriting in college, and perhaps for that reason her stories reveal an unusual interest in small, run-down spaces. The short story \\"Christmas Special\\" takes place in a run-down inn, while \\"Run, Daddy, Run\\" and \\"Happy Life\\" are set in half-basement rooms. \\"I Go to the Convenience Store\\" features the intensively capitalistic space of a convenience store, and the backdrop of \\"Sky Kong Kong\\" is a rooftop room in a small provincial city. Her humorous depiction of the people who live in these spaces evokes a rich pathos.

History First released in 1984, it has been under continuous development in response to user feedback. Version 6.0 released in April 2013 added network modelling capability and new vehicle movement classes. Version 7.0 includes new timing analysis methods for Common Control Groups (multiple intersections operating under one signal controller) and Network Cycle Time and Signal Offset calculations for signal coordination. The latest Version 9.0 includes improved network model processing efficiency and improved workflow efficiency through substantial user interface enhancements and model improvements. These include increased computing speeds for the iterative network analysis method, optimum cycle time for networks and common control groups, network demand and sensitivity analysis methods, graphical displays of intersection geometry, volumes, signal phasing and movement IDs in Site input dialogs allowing direct data entry, a large number of new reports and displays for Sites, Networks and Routes including Project Summary and the User Report facility based on user- defined report templates. Sidra Intersection is a micro-analytical traffic evaluation tool that employs lane-by-lane and vehicle drive cycle models. It can be used to compare alternative treatments of individual intersections and networks of intersections involving signalised intersections (fixed- time/pretimed and actuated), roundabouts (unsignalised), roundabouts with metering signals, fully signalised roundabouts, two-way stop and give-way (yield) sign control, all-way (4-way and 3-way) stop sign control, merging, single-point urban interchanges, traditional diamond and diverging diamond interchanges, basic freeway segments, signalised and unsignalised midblock crossings for pedestrians, merging analysis and network modelling of these intersection and interchange types. Sidra Intersection allows modelling of separate Movement Classes (Light Vehicles, Heavy Vehicles, Buses, Bicycles, Large Trucks, Light Rail/Trams and six User Classes) with different vehicle characteristics. These movements can be allocated to different lanes, lane segments and signal phases; for example for modelling bus priority lanes and signals. In Australia and New Zealand, Sidra Intersection is endorsed by Austroads. In the US, Sidra Intersection is recognised by the US Highway Capacity Manual,TRB/FHWA 2010 Roundabout Guide (NCHRP Report 672) and various roundabout guides.  Lane-based intersection and network analysis method  The lane-by-lane capacity and performance analysis method used by Sidra Intersection includes identifying any de facto exclusive lanes, unequal lane utilisation, lane change, modelling of short lanes (turn bays, lanes with parking upstream, and loss of a lane at the exit side) and lane blockage in shared lanes including lanes containing opposed (permitted) turns, slip (bypass) lane movements and turns on red. Intersections and networks can be modelled in detail using this method and signal timings can be determined accordingly with advantages over approach-based and lane group-based methods.Ak√ßelik, R.(2015) \\"Modelling signal platoon patterns by approach lane use and movement class.\\" Urban Transport XXI, WIT Transactions on the Built Environment, Vol. 146, WIT Press, Southampton, UK, pp 521‚Äì532.  Network model SIDRA NETWORK model provides a lane-based congestion modelling tool. It determines the backward spread of congestion as queues on downstream lanes block upstream lanes, and applies capacity constraint to oversaturated upstream lanes; thus limiting the flows entering downstream lanes. These two elements are highly interactive with opposite effects. A network-wide iterative process is used to find a solution that balances these opposite effects. The lane-based network model provides information about departure and arrival patterns, queue lengths, lane blockage probabilities, backward spread of queues, and so on at a lane level. The model allows for the effect of upstream lane use patterns on downstream signal platoon patterns, in turn affecting the estimates of network performance measures (travel time, delay, back of queue, stop rate). This is important especially in evaluating closely spaced (paired) intersections and interchanges with high demand flows where vehicles have limited opportunities for lane changing between intersections. Such facilities include staggered T intersections, freeway signalised diamond interchanges, freeway roundabout interchanges, fully signalised roundabouts (including signalised circulating roads), large signalised intersections with wide median storage areas, staged crossings at sign-controlled intersections, intersections with nearby pedestrian crossings, and alternative intersection and interchange configurations such as diverging diamond interchanges (signalised), continuous flow intersections, restricted cross-street U-turns, and so on. The modelling of arrival patterns at downstream approach lanes takes into account implied midblock lane changes. Different movement classes (light and heavy vehicles, buses, large trucks, bicycles, and so on) are treated individually in modelling platoon arrival and departure patterns.Ak√ßelik, R.(2015) \\"Modelling signal platoon patterns by approach lane use and movement class.\\" Urban Transport XXI, WIT Transactions on the Built Environment, Vol. 146, WIT Press, Southampton, UK, pp 521‚Äì532.  Performance measures  Sidra Intersection provides a large number of intersection and network performance measures and a number of alternative Level of Service (LOS) methods and LOS Target settings to determine acceptable intersection and network design. Standard performance measures such as delay, queue length and number of stops as well as measures to help with environmental impacts and economic analysis are provided. Performance and Level of Service results are given at various aggregation levels (individual lanes, individual movements, approaches, intersections, routes and networks) and separately for vehicles, pedestrians, and persons (results for pedestrians and people in vehicles combined). Extensive graphical displays present signal timing and performance output.  Roundabouts  Sidra Intersection allows analysis of single-lane and multi-lane roundabouts. It employs a combined (hybrid) geometry and gap- acceptance modelling approach in order to take into account the effect of roundabout geometry on driver behaviour directly through gap-acceptance modelling. Sidra Intersection software includes templates for roundabouts including all roundabout examples given in MUTCD 2009 and TRB/FHWA 2010 Roundabout Informational Guide (NCHRP Report 672). A Roundabout Metering analysis method allows the evaluation of the effect of metering signals on roundabout capacity and performance. Metering signals help to solve the problem of excessive queuing and delays at approaches affected by unbalanced traffic streams at roundabouts. Fully signalised roundabouts can be modelled as a network. A recent NCHRP survey of US state transport agencies found that Sidra Intersection is the most widely used software tool in the US for roundabout analysis as reported in the US Transportation Research Board document titled Roundabout Practice.  Signal Timing Methods  Sidra Intersection includes fixed-time / pretimed (EQUISAT) and actuated signal timing analysis methods for intersections with any geometry allowing for simple as well as complex phasing arrangements. In addition to the traditional methods for signalised intersection cycle time (practical, optimum and user- given) and green split methods, it includes advanced signal timing methods such as a unique critical movement analysis method, variable phasing analysis, green split priority for coordinated or user-specified movements, and allows the use of two green periods for modeling slip / bypass lanes, permitted- protected turns, and turn on red. Network signal timing methods are available to determine cycle time (practical, optimum and user-given), green times and signal offsets for coordination of signalised intersections controlled by separate signal controllers as well as Common Control Group timings for intersections running under a single signal controller. The lane-based network model includes detailed movements of vehicle platoons with lane changes between signalised intersections for assessing the efficiency of signal coordination and optimising signal timings for signalised intersection networks.  Model calibration  Sidra Intersection provides facilities to calibrate its traffic models for local conditions. It provides software setups with appropriate default systems for different countries, allows the users to prepare customised software setups, provides a sensitivity analysis facility to allow testing of the effect of variations in values of various key parameters, and describes various calibration techniques (including survey methods) in the User Guide. In particular, the US HCM (Customary and Metric) software setups of SIDRA INTERSECTION are calibrated using model parameters based on the US Highway Capacity Manual (see the section titled Highway Capacity Manual). Among many model parameters, the saturation flow parameter for signalized intersections and the critical gap and follow-up headway parameters for unsignalised roundabouts and sign-controlled intersections are identified as key parameters for calibration to match real-life traffic conditions. At the same time, the queue space (jam spacing) parameter used in back of queue modelling is identified as a key parameter in general due to its role in approach short lane modelling for intersections and lane blockage (queue spillback) modelling for networks.  Emissions and energy  Sidra Intersection estimates the cost, energy and air pollution implications of intersection design using a four-mode elemental model with detailed acceleration, deceleration, idling and cruise elements. This drive-cycle (modal analysis) method coupled with a power-based vehicle model is used to estimate operating cost, fuel consumption, greenhouse gas (CO2) and pollutant (CO, NOx, HC) emissions in order to assess the environmental impacts of traffic congestion. The model includes estimates of acceleration and deceleration times and distances for light and heavy vehicles coupled with a polynomial model of acceleration-time profile. The vehicle parameters in the model have been updated recently for modern vehicle fleet.  Highway Capacity Manual  Sidra Intersection software complements Highway Capacity Manual (HCM Edition 6) as an advanced intersection analysis tool which offers various extensions on the capabilities of the HCM. The Highway Capacity Manual version of Sidra Intersection has options for US Customary and Metric units. The roundabout capacity model for single-lane and multi-lane roundabouts based on research on US roundabouts as described in HCM Edition 6, Chapter 22 is integrated into the software. The HCM Edition 6 roundabout capacity model is a lane-based model which is suitable for the extensions implemented in Sidra Intersection.  Scientific foundation and awards  Sidra Intersection was first developed over 20 years at the Australian Road Research Board (1979‚Äì1999) as a technology transfer tool to enable practitioners to use major research results without delay, and then at Akcelik and Associates since 2000. Akcelik and Associates conducts its own research s well as using the latest research results which become available internationally including the Highway Capacity Manual. Thus Sidra Intersection includes high technical content based on extensive scientific research. A formal \\"effectiveness audit\\" of related research carried out by an independent panel formed by the Australian Road Research Board in 1993 noted \\"the panel rated the technical merit of the research as very high and concluded that it has established international and professional reputations in the fields of traffic signal analysis, roundabout analysis, and energy and emissions modelling\\". The company has won awards including the 2010 Telstra Business Awards ‚Äì AMP Innovation Award and the 2009 the Governor of Victoria Export Awards ‚Äì Winner Small Business Award. The awards received by the founder of the company, Dr Rahmi Akcelik, includes the prestigious 1999 Clunies Ross National Science and Technology award for outstanding contribution to the application of science and technology in Australia, and the Institute of Transportation Engineers (USA) 1986 Transportation Energy Conservation Award in Memory of Frederick A. Wagner for research into energy savings from urban traffic management (received as part of the energy research team at the Australian Road Research Board).

It is one of the most important Renaissance buildings in central Germany, which has experienced no structural changes to this day and is preserved in almost its original condition. History In 1583, the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel became the sole owner of the Lordship of Schmalkalden, which had been shared with the Counts of Henneberg until then. Landgrave William IV immediately decided to make the city one of his secondary residences. He had the 12th Century Waltaff Castle demolished and began the construction of the castle named after him on the same location. The castle was inaugurated on 23 May 1590, although it had not yet been completed. The interior was procured from Kassel. William's son Maurice often stayed at Wilhelmsburg castle. During his reign, the castle was finally completed in 1618. His successors used the castle less and less and in the early 19th Century the castle was abandoned altogether. In 1873, the Association for Henneberg History and Geography purchased the castle and began using it as a museum. Building One of the many indoor spaces The palace is a four-winged structure with a nearly square floor plan. The comprehensive facilities include an outdoor parade grounds, a gatekeeper's house, pleasure gardens, a kitchen garden, a prison tower, stables, a bakery and a brewery. The spatial arrangement is typical for a residential palace. The halls were decorated with scrollwork and strapwork and adorned with decorative paintings, including a copy of the Iwein epos by Hartmann von Aue the basement. Located on the City Palace is a four-winged structure with a nearly square floor plan. The comprehensive facilities include outdoor parade ground, gatekeepers house, pleasure gardens, kitchen garden, prison tower, stables and bakery and brewery. The spatial arrangement corresponds to a representative of the Royal Palace. The halls were labeled with Roll - equipped and strapwork, just as they are adorned with decorative paintings - which includes a copy of the Iwein epic in Hartmann von Aue the basement. Interior of the castle church Ballroom Renaissance organ The magnificent castle church, built by Dutch architect Willem Vernukken in 1590, is one of the oldest and most beautiful newly built Protestant churches in Germany. Many German Lutheran churches of the 18th century followed its example with the connection of altar with baptismal font, pulpit and organ in a vertical axis; central paintings above the altar were replaced with pulpits. Organ The Renaissance organ in the chapel is one of the oldest instruments of this kind in Central Europe that is still playable. It was commissioned by Landgrave William IV and built by Daniel Meyer in G√∂ttingen. The organ receives its special timbre from 252 wooden pipes, six registers and its so-called bird cry. It was played for the first time on 23 May 1590 when the castle church was consecrated during the inauguration of the castle. Museum The castle houses the permanent exhibition Dawn of a new era, with the main topics Renaissance, Reformation and Schmalkaldic League.

Biography Hirata was born in Gantung, Belitung. While he was young, his parents changed his name seven times. They eventually settled on the name Andrea, while the name Hirata was given by his mother. He grew up in a poor family not far from a government-owned mine. Hirata started his tertiary education with a degree in economics from the University of Indonesia. After receiving a scholarship from the European Union, he did his master's degree in Europe, first at the University of Paris then at Sheffield Hallam University in Britain; his thesis dealt with telecommunications and the economy. Hirata released Laskar Pelangi in 2005. The novel, was written in a period of six months, and was based on his childhood experiences in Belitung; he later described it as \\"an irony about a lack of access to education for children in one of the world's wealthiest islands.\\". The novel went on to sell five million copies, with pirated editions selling 15 million more. It also spawned three sequels: Sang Pemimpi (The Dreamer), Edensor and Maryamah Karpov. Laskar Pelangi was adapted into a film of the same name in 2008 by directors Riri Riza and Mira Lesmana; the film became the most-viewed Indonesian film of all time, being seen by 5 million viewers during its theatrical run. He also worked at the telecommunications company Telkom Indonesia, eventually quitting to focus on writing. In 2010 the international rights for the Laskar Pelangi tetralogy were bought by American agent Amer & Asia; the rights were later acquired by Kathleen Anderson Literary Management. Afterwards, Hirata opened a library in his hometown. By 2010, he was spending weekends in Belitung and weekdays in Java. He later published his first English-language short story, \\"Dry Season\\", in Washington Square Review. That same year, he spent three months attending a writer's workshop at the University of Iowa. In 2011, television network SCTV announced a 15-episode serial adaption of Laskar Pelangi; Hirata had previously said he would not allow such an adaptation, but later relented as he felt the network could guarantee quality. By 2012 the English translation of Laskar Pelangi had been picked up by FSG, Penguin Books, and Random House for sale in twenty countries; Hirata was the first Indonesian writer to be published with FSG. That year he was a speaker at the Byron Bay Writers Festival.

He was the eldest son of upper rabbi Joseph Wijnkoop and Dientje Milia Nijburg.  Life  At the Barlaeus Gymnasium, he was not accepted as a member of the school association Disciplina Scipio Vitae because he was a Jew. He joined the Social Democratic Workers' Party, or the SDAP, in 1898 and broke with it in 1909 by SDAP and was, with Jan Ceton, co-founder of the Social Democratic Party, predecessor of the Communist Party of Holland. Historici.nl - WIJNKOOP, David (1876-1941) Wijnkoop was the leader of the Communists in the years around World War I. He agitated fiercely against the Social Democrats and organized demonstrations in Amsterdam at the Amsterdam SDAP-alderman Floor Wibaut. He left the CPH in 1925, but returned to it later. Historici.nl - WIJNKOOP, David (1876-1941) Wijnkoop interpellated notably starting in 1918, with the government's action against German Crown Prince Wilhelm, and the action of the mayor of Amsterdam in connection with the movements that took place and the situation in the Netherlands in connection with Germany. This continued in 1919, against Minister of Foreign Affairs Herman van Karnebeek on the presence of the former German emperor Wilhelm in the Netherlands, the transit of German troops through Limburg and the persecution of Jews in Poland and Galicia. This continued later into the year, when he talked with Van Karnebeek about the negotiations of the Dutch authorities with various German authorities. After a year of no notable action in 1920, in 1921, Wijnkoop interpellated against Van Karnebeek again, this time to provide support to the starving workers and peasants in Soviet Russia. Then, in 1922 and 1924, he showed further Communist sympathies by pressuring minister of the Dutch government Simon de Graaff of the persecution against Communists in Dutch East Indies, and against minister Gerardus Jacobus van Swaaij on the pay cut for railway staff, respectively. In 1924, he pressured De Graaff again, this time after the government of the British Raj announced measures to combat the popular movement of workers and peasants in India. After going without much notable action for about 4 years, he came up again, this time against Prime Minister Charles Ruijs de Beerenbrouck about the violent clashes between police and workers following a strike in a Zinc oxide factory in Maastricht. Then, the next year, he interpellated against Minister of Justice, Jan Donner, on Communists' homes being searched, and then in 1931, against Donner again, this time on the banning of The Tribune from public reading rooms and from station bookshops. In 1932, Wijnkoop targeted Dutch Envoy to China Frans Beelaerts van Blokland on the Dutch attitude towards the situation in Shanghai., and later in 1932 against minister John Paul Reymer on the wages of railway employees and the proposed wage reductions. Afterwards, in 1935, he worked against Minister of Public Works Otto Van Lidth de Jeude, in support of the interference of government in the conflict with privately owned mines. In 1938, he fought against government minister Jacob Patijn on the recognition of the King of Italy as Emperor of Ethiopia. In 1939, he clashed with the government again, this time against Minister of Justice Carel Goseling on the cooperation of the Netherlands to supply the needs of Spanish refugees during the Spanish Civil War. Finally, in 1939, he talked with Prime Minister Hendrikus Colijn about the cause of the resignation of the Minister of Finance and the resulting consequences of his resignation. In 1931, Wijnkoop initiated a proposal to combat the adverse effects of the economic crisis on the workers. However, the proposal was withdrawn in 1932. In 1907 Wijnkoop founded, together with Jan Cornelis Ceton and Willem van Ravesteyn, a magazine, called The Tribune. Together, with the rest of the Tribune group, he left the SDAP and founded the Social Democratic Party, which in 1919 changed its name to Communist Party of Holland, or the CPH. In 1925, Wijnkoop left the CPH, together with a number of supporters. The conflict was related to the growing pains of the party, but also with the wish to get a \\"workers deputy\\" in parliament instead of Van Ravesteyn. He sided with Van Ravesteyn. With the support of the Communist International, the minority in this conflict managed to win and Wijnkoop left. On Prinsjesdag 1932, he and fellow Communist Louis de Visser interrupted the Throne Speech from Queen Wilhelmina by shouting. This was countered by other MPs loudly singing the national anthem. In 1934, Wijnkoop and De Visser did the same, only to be forcibly removed from the Ridderzaal where the speech was read. While in hiding from the Germans during World War II, Wijnkoop suffered a fatal heart attack. Many people, including wanted communists, socialists and Jews, showed up at his funeral. Wijnkoop's wife, Johanna van Rees, was angry that Louis de Visser showed up at the funeral while he was wanted, but still asked him to do the graveside speech. It was the last public speech of De Visser, who did not survive the war.  Career overview  Caricature of Wijnkoop by Willem van Schaik, ca. 1937 * Inspector at Workers Insurance Company De Centrale, from 1904 to 1907 (resigned after conflict with the director FWN Hugenholtz) * Editor at De Tribune, from October 1907 to and April 1916 (co-founder) * Remunerated propagandist at SDP, from 1909 to 1916 * Head editor at De Tribune, from 1916 to 1925 * Member of the House of Representatives from September 1918 to September 1925 * Member of the City council Amsterdam, from September 1919 to 30 July 1940 (removed from the council by the Germans because of his Jewish ancestry) * Editor of the Communistische Gids, from 1926 to 1930 * Member of States-Provincial North Holland, from July 1927 to July 1939 * Member of the House of Representatives, from September 1929 to 7 May 1941 (died in office, while in hiding) * Interned in Hoorn, from 10 May 1940 to 15 May 1940 * Hiding in Amsterdam, from July 1940 to 7 May 1941  Education  As a young man, Wijnkoop attended several schools.

It aired on MBC from February 7 to May 24, 2011 on Mondays and Tuesdays at 21:55 for 32 episodes. Filmed at MBC Dramia in Gyeonggi Province, the series examines how class determines fate during the Joseon era through two men who swap lives. Switched at birth, Chun-doong and Gwi-dong grow up living each other's lives. Nobleman's son Chun-doong endures great hardships in the lowest caste of society, and becomes a vigilante who steals from the rich. Beggar's son Gwi- dong grows up in a wealthy noble family, and becomes a police chief. Living on opposite sides of the law, their paths cross again when they both fall for the same woman; played by Chun, Lee and Han respectively. Plot Around the time of late Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) when hierarchy between nobles and slaves started to fall apart and riots were common among peasants, two men were born on the same day and at the same time. Chun Dung who grew up in a beggar's quarters (although born as a noble) with no knowledge of his parents, dreams of \\"making this world a better place\\" by taking part in the peasants‚Äô riot while Gwi Dong who was raised in a noble life (though he was born as a beggar), serves as a police official, fights against corruption within the government and speaks for the weak. Although both give their hearts to the same woman, they become the greatest duo ever in order to reform the problematic world. The background of the drama is not set in a grand palace but an everyday market and talks not of the success of a great hero but the agony of common people. The Duo portrays the everyday lives and loves of the commoners and outcasts during 19th century Korea: Slaves, beggars, leather shoemakers, thieves, street bums and butchers, people who were poor yet good at heart. It is centered on the humanism and sentiments of those whose life stories have often been neglected in the typical \\"royal family centered\\" dramas.

The initial license application of the party was rejected in July 2010. It was legalized in May 2011, just after the Egypt's 25 January Revolution in 2011. The party participated in the 2011‚Äì12 Egyptian parliamentary election and won 9 seats in the lower house. The party merged with the Misruna party (Our Egypt party) in June 2011; the party name changed slightly. Although the Reform and Development Misruna Party participated in the 2015 parliamentary elections, Sadat criticized the election process, which was delayed for 7 months, as well as the Supreme Constitutional Court being allowed to rule on complaints against election laws. The party has gradually distanced itself from president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and Sadat briefly ran in the 2018 Egyptian presidential election, though he withdrew. Sadat criticized the pro- Sisi \\"Alashan Tbneeha\\" (To Build It) campaign on constitutional grounds for allowing government employees to publicly support the campaign.

Until 2011, this widely distributed species was known as Deroceras panormitanum, and earlier as Deroceras caruanae or Agriolimax caruanae, but Reise et al. (2011) showed that these names refer to a distinct species of similar external appearance known at that time only from Sicily and Malta. Consequently, although the more widespread species was already well known, it then had to be redescribed under the new name of D. invadens. This species is not listed in the IUCN red list ‚Äì not evaluated (NE) 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Cited 10 January 2008. Description Adults are usually 20‚Äì35 mm long. The skin and flesh are watery and fairly transparent. The colour of the skin varies between light greyish-brown to almost black. Close inspection reveals fine dark spotting usually over the whole body; this shows up better in alcohol-preserved specimens. Often, but not always, the respiratory pore is pale and unspotted. The mucus is colourless. D. invadens preserved in ethanol. Scale = 3 mmParticularly in North America, some Deroceras laeve grow large enough that they closely resemble D. invadens. A useful clue to distinguish them is the profile of the end of the tail when the animal has been disturbed or is preserved. The tail of D. invadens usually slants vertically upward from the sole for a short distance, or even bends backwards. The tail of D. laeve slopes forward above the sole. Also, the tail of D. invadens is longer than the mantle, whereas it is the same length or shorter in D. laeve. Penis, twisted to reveal the ventral sideNevertheless, dissection is required to distinguish D. invadens reliably from D. laeve and from various similar Deroceras species occurring in Europe, such as Deroceras sturanyi, the true Deroceras panormitanum, and Deroceras golcheri. Reise et al. (2011) discuss and figure the most critical anatomical characters. In most populations of D. invadens, the proximal penis has two side pockets (the penial caecum and penial lobe); these have roughly equal widths and both have rounded, stout ends. A prominent appending penial gland with 3‚Äì7 branches attaches between the caecum and lobe on the dorsal side; these branches are less knobbly in outline than those of D. panormitanum. The penial retractor muscle attaches between the caecum and lobe on the ventral side. The intestinal caecum is either absent or represented merely by a widening of the rectum. Barker (1999) and Sirgel (1973) detail various other aspects of the anatomy. Distribution The distribution has been extensively reviewed by Hutchinson et al. (2014). The native range is the southern and perhaps central parts of Italy but the first certain record is from Britain in 1930. Deroceras invadens now occurs in very many other parts of the world, although there is only one record from Asia. The list below gives dates of the first reported findings (outdoors unless stated); oceanic Islands are considered separately at the end. Distribution of Deroceras invadens.

However, this species has also spread to natural habitats such as woodland and grassland (e.g. in Britain, Tenerife, South Africa and Australia). It prefers areas of high humidity and cannot survive temperatures below ‚Äì7 ¬∞C. Its distribution appears restricted by low winter temperatures, which could explain its slow and only partial colonisation of central Europe and its recent range expansion in Sweden following climate amelioration. It can be a significant pest in gardens, greenhouses, pasture, and arable fields. In captivity, slugs eat their own body weight of lettuce in two or three days. In North Wales, most adults start to lay eggs in autumn and have died by early spring; the species can be found in any season, but it is most abundant in late spring. In New Zealand pastureland, populations fall considerably in summer. In agricultural fields in northern Italy, D. invadens was commonly trapped from November to May, but not at all in summer. Behaviour thumb The mating behaviour of this species has been particularly well studied, partly to provide taxonomic characters. Mating starts when one individual closely follows the flattened tail of the other (precourtship). Typically after some minutes the leader turns back and protrudes its sarcobelum (a tapering finger-like part of the penis), as does its partner shortly afterwards. The partners often form a circle head to tail. Early courtship involves violent biting of the partner, lashing the sarcobelum against the partner, and bursts of tail wagging. This is gradually replaced by more gentle-looking stroking of the sarcobelum across the partner. During courtship, sperm accumulates in the penial caecum. After about 90 minutes the partners orient themselves face-to-face, nibble the base of the partner's raised sarcobelum, and suddenly their penises simultaneously evert. The finger-like penial caecum curves round the back of the partner's sarcobelum, transferring sperm onto it. The penes remain everted for a variable period (typically some minutes) before the penial lobe and then the penial gland also evert. The latter transfers a secretion onto the partner. This is directly followed by retraction of the penis (each partner thereby taking up the transferred sperm) and then separation. Laboratory experiments suggest that D. invadens shows a diurnal rhythm of active locomotion and feeding at night, then inactivity in or below the litter layer during the day; the rhythm is entrained by light. This feeding cycle is accompanied by regular cytological changes in the organs of digestion. Deroceras invadens exhibited the highest crawling speed (4.9 mm/s) amongst measurements from 28 species of terrestrial slug and snail.

It is a deficit reduction programme consisting of sustained reductions in public spending and tax rises, intended to reduce the government budget deficit and the role of the welfare state in the United Kingdom. The Conservative government claimed that the National Health Service and education have been \\"ringfenced\\" and protected from direct spending cuts, but between 2010 and 2019 more than ¬£30 billion in spending reductions have been made to welfare payments, housing subsidies and social services. The effects of United Kingdom austerity policies have proved controversial and the policies have received criticism from a variety of politicians and economists. Anti-austerity movements have been formed among citizens more generally. History A UK government budget surplus in 2001‚Äì2 was followed by many years of budget deficit and after the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 a period of economic recession began in the country. The first austerity measures were introduced in late 2008. In 2009, the term age of austerity, which had previously been used to describe the years immediately following World War II, was popularised by Conservative Party leader David Cameron. In his keynote speech to the Conservative Party forum in Cheltenham on 26 April 2009 he declared that \\"the age of irresponsibility is giving way to the age of austerity\\" and committed to end years of what he characterised as excessive government spending. Conservative Party leaders also promoted the idea of budget cuts bringing about the Big Society, a political ideology involving reduced government, with grass-roots organizations, charities and private companies delivering public services more efficiently. The austerity programme was initiated in 2010 by the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government. In his June 2010 budget speech, the Chancellor George Osborne identified two goals. The first was that the structural current budget deficit would be eliminated to \\"achieve [a] cyclically-adjusted current balance by the end of the rolling, five-year forecast period\\". The second was that national debt as a percentage of GDP would be falling. The government intended to achieve both of its goals through substantial reductions in public expenditure. This was to be achieved by a combination of public spending reductions and tax increases amounting to ¬£110 billion. The end of the forecast period was 2015‚Äì16. Between 2010 and 2013, the Coalition government said that it had reduced public spending by ¬£14.3 billion compared with 2009‚Äì10. Growth remained low during this period, while unemployment rose. In a speech in 2013, David Cameron indicated that his government had no intention of increasing public spending once the structural deficit had been eliminated and proposed that the public spending reduction be made permanent. In 2014, the Treasury extended the proposed austerity period until at least 2018. By 2015, the deficit, as a percentage of GDP, had been reduced to half of what it was in 2010, and the sale of government assets (mostly the shares of banks nationalised in the 2000s) had resulted in government debt as a proportion of GDP falling. By 2016, the Chancellor was aiming to deliver a budget surplus by 2020, but following the result of the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, he expressed the opinion that this goal was no longer achievable. Osborne's successor as Chancellor, Philip Hammond, retained the aim of a balanced budget but abandoned plans to eliminate the deficit by 2020. In Hammond's first Autumn statement in 2016, there was no mention of austerity, and some commentators concluded that the austerity programme had ended. However, in February 2017, Hammond proposed departmental budget reductions of up to 6% for the year 2019‚Äì20, and Hammond's 2017 budget continued government policies of freezing working-age benefits. Following the 2017 snap general election, Hammond confirmed in a speech at Mansion House that the austerity programme would be continued and Michael Fallon, the Secretary of State for Defence, commented: \\"we all understand that austerity is never over until we've cleared the deficit\\". Government spending reductions planned for the period 2017‚Äì2020 are consistent with some departments, such as the Department for Work and Pensions and the Ministry of Justice, experiencing funding reductions of approximately 40% in real terms over the decade 2010‚Äì2020. During 2017 an overall budget surplus on day-to-day spending was achieved for the first time since 2001. This fulfilled one of the fiscal targets set by George Osborne in 2010, which he had hoped to achieve in 2015. In 2018 the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted that in 2018‚Äì19 public sector debt would fall as a share of national income for the first time since 2001‚Äì02, while tax revenues would exceed public spending. Hammond's 2018 Spring Statement suggested that austerity measures could be reduced in the Autumn Budget of that year. However, according to the Resolution Foundation and the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), the OBR's forecasts for borrowing and debt were based on the assumption that the government continued with the planned spending reductions that were announced after the 2015 general election. By 2018 only 25% of the proposed reductions in welfare spending had been implemented. The Resolution Foundation calculated that the proposed reduction in spending on working-age benefits amounted to ¬£2.5 billion in 2018‚Äì19 and ¬£2.7 billion in 2019‚Äì20, with the households most affected being the poorest 20%. The IFS calculated that the OBR's figures would require spending on public services per person in real terms to be 2% lower in 2022‚Äì23 than in 2019‚Äì20. The deficit in the first quarter of the 2018‚Äì19 financial year was lower than at any time since 2007 and by August 2018 it had reached the lowest level since 2002‚Äì3. Hammond's aim at this time was to eliminate the deficit entirely by the mid-2020s. At the Conservative Party conference in October 2018 Prime Minister Theresa May indicated her intention to end the austerity programme following Brexit in 2019 and opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said that austerity could not be ended without significant increases in public spending. The IFS calculated that funding an end to austerity would require an additional ¬£19 billion per year raised through higher government borrowing or tax increases. Hammond's preference was to reduce the national debt with more years of austerity but in the October 2018 budget he agreed to defer the target date for eliminating the deficit, abandoning plans to achieve a surplus in 2022‚Äì23 to allow an increase in health spending and tax cuts. The Resolution Foundation described the step as a \\"significant easing of austerity\\". Hammond said that the \\"era of austerity is finally coming to an end\\" but that there would be no \\"real terms\\" increase in public spending apart from on the NHS. Effects The austerity programme included reductions in welfare spending, the cancellation of school building programs, reductions in local government funding, and an increase in VAT. Spending on the police, courts and prisons was also reduced. A number of quangos were abolished, merged or reduced as a result of the 2010 UK quango reforms. Child poverty Between 1998 and 2012 the number of children living in \\"relative poverty\\" in the UK had risen by approximately 800,000 to a total of around 3.5 million. Following the introduction of the Welfare Reform Act 2012 the number of children in \\"relative poverty\\" increased, with the total by 2019 around 600,000 higher than it had been in 2012. During those seven years the number of children obtaining food from the food banks of The Trussell Trust more than tripled. Demographics A number of independent reports have considered the demographic effects of the austerity programme. In 2011, activist collective Feminist Fightback described its gendered impact and in 2012 the Fawcett Society published a report which was critical of the Treasury for not assessing the impact of austerity on women's equality. A 2015 report by the Resolution Foundation identified age-related disparities in the effects of austerity changes. The report projected that during the 2010s transfers to local authorities would fall by 64% and that spending on working- age welfare would fall by 71%, while between 1997 and 2020 spending on older people and health would rise from 33.8% to 43.4% of total government spending. In the same year a group of political scientists at the University of Nottingham found that the impact of austerity on in-work benefits and housing policy had been harmful to working families with children, while wealthy pensioners and older homeowners had benefited. In 2016 research from the Women's Budget Group and the Runnymede Trust indicated that women, people of colour and in particular women of colour had been affected most by austerity, and that they would continue to be affected disproportionately until 2020. This was due to the fact that black and Asian women were more likely to be employed in the public sector, be in low-paid jobs and insecure work, and experience higher levels of unemployment than other groups. Research published in 2017 by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation identified an increase in child poverty and pensioner poverty compared to the previous year, following significant overall decreases during the previous 20 years. Reductions in benefit support and a shortage of affordable housing were considered to be contributing factors. Food banks Researchers have linked budget cuts and sanctions against benefit claimants to increasing use of food banks. In a twelve-month period from 2014 to 2015, over one million people in the United Kingdom had used a food bank, representing a \\"19% year-on-year increase in food bank use\\". The use of food banks almost doubled between 2013 and 2017. A study published in the British Medical Journal in 2015 found that each one percentage point increase in the rate of Jobseeker's Allowance claimants sanctioned was associated with a 0.09 percentage point rise in food bank use. Research by The Trussell Trust found that the use of food banks increased more in areas where Universal Credit was introduced. However, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found that the number of people answering yes to the question \\"Have there been times in the past 12 months when you did not have enough money to buy food that you or your family needed?\\" decreased from 9.8% in 2007 to 8.1% in 2012, leading some to say that the rise was due to both more awareness of food banks, and the government allowing Jobcentres to refer people to food banks when they were hungry, in contrast to previous governments. Housing  Social Housing  When the coalition government came to power in 2010, capital investment in new affordable homes was cut by 60%, while government-imposed caps on local authority borrowing continued to restrict their ability to raise money to build new homes. Writing in Inside Housing, former housing minister John Healey observed that rate of starting social rented schemes had declined from 40,000 in 2009/10 to less than 1,000 in 2015/16. When the government eventually released its \\"Affordable Homes Programme\\" for 2011-2015 and accompanying funding guidelines it established a new type of affordable housing- \\"affordable rent\\" that can be up to 80% of the market rent and hence at levels that can be significantly higher than social rents, and affordable rents are around 30% higher than social rents on average among housing association properties. The provision of affordable rent is meant to compensate for the drastically reduced central government subsidy for new social housing (an average of ¬£20,000 per home in 2012 versus ¬£60,000 per home under the previous National Affordable Housing Programme 2008-2011), allowing housing associations and local authorities to raise more revenue from rent payments to be used for long-term capital investments. By 2018, a large majority of newly built social housing in England was created for affordable rent instead of the often much lower social rent, while the proportion of new- build social housing using affordable rent has been much less significant in Wales and Scotland where most new-build social housing continues to be built for social rent levels, while in Northern Ireland the affordable rent product has not been used. Meanwhile, in London more than 10,000 existing properties that were previously let at social rent levels have been changed to affordable rent. Though housing benefit tenants, exempt as they are from LHA rates, are not directly effected by the move towards \\"affordable\\" as opposed to social rents, a large number of in-work tenants who many not qualify for any housing benefit will be directly effected by the higher rents. The number of people sleeping rough on any one night across England had more than doubled between 2010 and 2016 to an estimated 4,134, according to a government street count.  Housing Benefit  The benefit cap, introduced via the Welfare Reform Act 2012, set a maximum level for the amount of state welfare benefits that could be paid to an individual household in any one year. The measure came into effect in 2013 with the figure initially set at ¬£26,000 per year, close to the average income of a family in the UK at that time. The anticipated reduction in government expenditure as a result of the measure was ¬£225 million by April 2015. The benefit cap initially affected approximately 12,000 households, mainly in high-rent areas of the UK such as London, but in 2016/17 the limit was reduced to ¬£20,000 per annum (¬£23,000 in London) extending its effects to around 116,000 households across the UK. A Local Housing Allowance (LHA) policy restricting Housing Benefit for private sector tenants to cover a maximum number of rooms had been in place since 2008 and was initially set at the 50th percentile of rents in an area (essentially it covered the median rent), while in 2011 the calculation was changed to the equivalent of the 30th percentile of rents (the cheapest third of housing in an area) and the following year instead of updating the LHA rates the government announced that instead rates would increase by a maximum equivalent to the rise of the Consumer Price Index. In 2015 the government announced a complete four year freeze on LHA rates (with some of the areas experiencing higher rents having their LHA lifted by 3% with Targeted Affordability Funding). Additionally, non-disabled persons under 35 saw their LHA payment restricted to the shared accommodation rate (instead of the one-bedroom rate that had previously been available) The under-occupancy penalty, introduced in 2013 and commonly known as the \\"bedroom tax\\", affected an estimated 660,000 working age social housing tenants in the UK, reducing weekly incomes by ¬£12‚Äì¬£22. Almost two thirds of the people affected by the penalty were disabled. The measure reduced the expenditure of the Department for Work and Pensions by approximately ¬£500 million per year. In 2015, George Osborne announced that tenants in social housing would have their housing benefit limited to LHA rates (used for private-sector tenants) from 2019, though Theresa May announced in 2017 that this policy had been scrapped. From April 2016 the LHA rates used to calculate maximum housing benefit levels for private sector tenants were frozen for four years. Research by the housing charity Shelter indicated that the proportion of such tenants likely to experience a shortfall in housing benefit was 80%, amounting to 300,000 families. The degree of shortfall depends on dwelling, location and individual circumstances, but Shelter expected that by 2020 the shortfall could in some cases reach hundreds of pounds a month. In April 2017, housing benefit payments were ended for new claims made by people aged 18‚Äì21. Research by Heriot-Watt University found that the policy would reduce annual government expenditure by ¬£3.3 million. During the period of austerity, the rate of homelessness rapidly increased. For example, during 2016 the rate of homelessness increased by 16%. By 2018 the number of families living in bed and breakfast accommodation was almost 50,000, and there were many more \\"hidden homeless\\" people living on the floors and sofas of friends and acquaintances. An article in The BMJ regarded this as a \\"neon sign that something is fundamentally wrong\\" with how society is being run, noting that \\"homeless women die on average at 43 and homeless men at 47, compared with 77 for the rest of us\\". The Office for National Statistics estimated that 597 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2017, an increase of 24% since 2012. Research was published in 2018 by Shelter analysing government data. It indicated that all forms of homelessness had increased since 2010 and that the number of households living in temporary accommodation had risen to more than 79,000. By 2017 over 33,000 families living in temporary accommodation were working, a proposition that had increased from 44% in 2013 to 55% in 2017. Shelter attributed this to a combination of higher rents, the freeze on housing benefits and the shortage of social housing. Local government The Local Government Association has identified a decrease in UK Government funding of almost 60 per cent for local authorities in England and Wales between 2010 and 2020. The reduction in central government funding for county councils in England combined with an increasing demand for social care services has caused reductions in expenditure on other services such as public libraries, refuse collection, road maintenance and Sure Start, along with increases to council tax rates and the introduction of additional charges for county council services. Local authority subsidies to bus services were reduced by almost half between 2010 and 2018. Research by the Local Government Chronicle has indicated that between 2010 and 2018 there were more than 220,000 redundancies of local authority employees and nearly ¬£4 billion was spent on redundancy payments, excluding outsourcing contracts. Rob Whiteman of CIPFA commented that \\"this scale of job losses reflects the intense financial pressure on councils as they now have no option other than to provide the bare minimum statutory provisions\\". Analysis by the Local Government Association in 2018 identified a decrease in the Revenue Support Grant for local authorities in England from ¬£9,927 million in 2015‚Äì16 to ¬£2,284 million for 2019‚Äì20, leaving 168 authorities with no grant for 2019‚Äì20. UK government plans in 2018 proposed the phasing out of grants to local authorities in England, instead funding English local government through a combination of local business rates and council tax. Research by the University of Cambridge published in 2018 said that the greatest reductions in local authority spending had occurred in impoverished post-industrial cities in the north of England and some poor Inner London boroughs. Over 30 such authorities in England had reduced spending by more than 30% between 2010 and 2017, with seven of them reducing spending by more than 40%. In contrast councils in wealthier areas had made smaller reductions. Councils in England experienced an average spending reduction of 24% compared to 12% in Scotland and 11.5% in Wales, the difference resulting from devolved government in those nations. In 2018 Northamptonshire County Council become insolvent and proposed reducing services to the minimum required by law. Austerity measures were blamed for the insolvency, as was the council's refusal to raise council tax despite the rising costs of providing social services. At the time the National Audit Office said that up to 15 other local authorities were also at risk of insolvency. A survey of council leaders, chief executives and mayors conducted by the New Local Government Network indicated that more than 70% of respondents expected that they would be unable to provide non-statutory services beyond 2023 if funding remained as restricted as it had been since 2010. In early 2019, three quarters of councils said they would have to raise taxes close to the legal maximum in order to cover costs, though many would nevertheless be cutting services. Mental health A 2012 article by Martin Knapp published in The BMJ's journal Evidence-Based Mental Health said that mental health problems could be attributed to a person's financial situation. At that time 45% of those who were in debt had mental health problems, compared to 14% of those who were not in debt. In 2010 over 40% of benefit claimants in Britain had \\"mental and behavioural disorders\\" recorded as their primary health condition. A 2015 report published by Psychologists for Social Change indicated that austerity had contributed significantly to the incidence and level of depression and other mental health conditions within the population. In 2016, figures analysed by the King's Fund think tank showed that \\"mental health trusts in England were still having their budgets cut, despite government assurances they would be funded on a par with physical healthcare\\". The analysis \\"suggests 40% of the 58 trusts saw budgets cut in 2015‚Äì16\\". A 2016 report authored by the NatCen Social Research for UNISON showed that LGBT people had suffered from a lack of access to mental health services as a result of austerity. Mortality Research funded by the National Institute for Health Research and published in 2015 identified austerity as one of the factors responsible for a rise in suicide attempts and suicide deaths since 2008, particularly in regard to Jobcentre policies. In 2017, the Royal Society of Medicine said that government austerity decisions in health and social care were likely to have resulted in 30,000 deaths in England and Wales in 2015. Research by University College London published in BMJ Open in 2017 compared the figures for health and social care funding during the 2000s with that during the period 2010‚Äì2014. It found that annual growth in health funding during the 2000s was 3.8%, but after 2010 this dropped to 0.41%. Annual growth in social care funding of 2.2% during the 2000s became an annual decrease of 1.57% after 2010. This coincided with mortality rates decreasing by 0.77% annually during the 2000s but rising by 0.87% annually after 2010. The rate of increase in life expectancy in England nearly halved between 2010 and 2017, according to research by epidemiology professor Michael Marmot. He commented that it was \\"entirely possible\\" that austerity was the cause and said: \\"If we don't spend appropriately on social care, if we don't spend appropriately on health care, the quality of life will get worse for older people and maybe the length of life, too.\\" A study published in BMJ Open in 2017 linked austerity to 120,000 extra deaths in England, primarily as a result of a reduction in the number of nurses. By 2018 figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) were showing a fall in life expectancy for those in poorer socioeconomic groups and those living in deprived areas, while average UK life expectancy had stopped improving. Public Health England was asked to carry out a review of life expectancy trends but government ministers said that the arguments put forward by some academics, that austerity had contributed to the change, could not be proved. ONS figures published in 2018 indicated that the slowdown in general life expectancy increase was one of the highest among a group of 20 of the world's leading economies. Police and crime Between 2010 and 2019 in England and Wales the number of police officers employed was reduced by approximately 20,000. At the same time the measured incidence of murder and robbery increased to their highest levels since the 2000s. Some police leaders have suggested that the reduction in police numbers is the cause, while other analysts have proposed reductions in spending on youth services and social services as the cause. Public sector pay There are approximately five million public sector workers in the UK. Between 2011 and 2013 there was a two-year pay freeze for all public sector workers earning an annual salary of ¬£21,000 or more, which was expected to reduce public expenditure by ¬£3.3 billion by 2014‚Äì15. In subsequent years a public sector pay cap resulted in annual public sector wage increases being effectively capped at 1% for 2013‚Äì2016, extended to 2020 in the 2015 budget. Advice was given to ministers by the civil service that the policy would result in a pay cut for many people in real terms and could increase child poverty. By 2015 the number of people employed in the Civil Service had been reduced to the lowest level since World War II and public sector employees made up 17.2% of the total workforce, the smallest proportion since comparable records began in 1999. During the 2017 general election the Conservative Party proposed retaining the cap until 2020, potentially reducing public sector expenditure by ¬£5bn. A Labour Party amendment to the 2017 Queen's Speech proposing the removal of the cap was defeated. A 2017 report commissioned by the Office of Manpower Economics indicated that between 2005 and 2015 median hourly earnings fell by 3% in real terms for public sector workers whose salaries are set on the advice of pay review bodies (around 45% of public sector staff). In September 2017, the Scottish Government announced that it intended to end the public sector pay cap in Scotland from 2018, and shortly afterwards the UK government announced the ending of the cap in England and Wales. By autumn 2017 public sector pay had fallen behind private sector pay for comparable work. Social security Working-age social security payments such as Universal Credit, Child Benefit, Child Tax Credit and Working Tax Credit, Housing Benefit and Jobseeker's Allowance have had their rate of increase reduced by austerity. From 2013 onwards, these payments were limited to a maximum annual increase of 1% instead of being increased annually according to the rate of inflation, while Child Benefit, previously available to all UK households with minor children was means-tested for the first time, with households where at least one parent earning over ¬£50,000 a year having their amount reduced. The policy of suspending the social security payments of unemployed claimants who were judged not to be adequately seeking work was continued, and the frequency and severity of the sanctions were increased. From 2016 a four-year freeze on all working-age social security payments was introduced. It was anticipated that it would affect 11 million UK families and reduce expenditure by ¬£9 billion, a figure later increased to ¬£13 billion. The Welfare Reform and Work Act 2016 abolished the Work-Related Activity Component of Employment and Support Allowance for new claimants from April 2017. This reduced the weekly social security payments for the disabled people affected by ¬£29.05 a week (at 2017/18 rates). The reduction in government expenditure was initially forecast to be ¬£640 million per annum by 2020/21, though this was later revised to ¬£450 million. Analysis in 2018 by the Resolution Foundation indicated that by April 2019 the freeze in social security payments would have resulted in more than 10 million households experiencing a loss of income in real terms, with the lack of an inflation- related increase in 2019 resulting in the average low-income couple with children losing an additional ¬£210 per year. The analysis also said that the cumulative effect of these social security limitations had been to reduce the value of working-age benefits by more than 6% in real terms. Child Benefit had become worth less than it was in 1999 in real terms, and for a second child it was worth 14% less than when it was introduced in 1979. State Pension The value of the State Pension has not been subject to austerity measures, being increased each year since 2011 by a minimum of 2.5% per annum. However, some people have been adversely affected financially in their 60s by the rise in the age at which the State Pension is first paid. The decision to equalise the State Pension ages of men and women was made by the government in 1995. From 2010 the women's State Pension age was steadily raised from 60 with the aim of matching that of men at 65 by 2018. An additional increase to 66 for both sexes is intended to be implemented by 2020. Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) in 2017 found that the household incomes of over one million women aged between 60 and 62 had become ¬£32 a week lower on average, and that poverty rates among that group had risen. The IFS also calculated that the reduction in state expenditure combined with the additional tax income from women continuing to work in their 60s resulted in a net increase in state revenue of ¬£5.1 billion per year. A rise in the State Pension age to 67 for both sexes in 2036 had been proposed by Gordon Brown in the 2000s, followed by a rise to 68 in 2046. By 2014 the date set for the rise to 67 had been brought forward to 2026 and in 2018 the rise to 68 was brought forward to 2037. This last change alone resulted in an anticipated reduction in DWP expenditure of ¬£74bn by 2046‚Äì47. Northern Ireland Reductions in public expenditure in Northern Ireland have often been described as not as harsh as those for the UK as a whole. This is primarily due to the fact that the UK government has not been able to exert direct control over welfare expenditure in Northern Ireland, because welfare policy is a devolved matter for the Northern Ireland Assembly. On a number of occasions the Assembly has not agreed to cuts in public spending, effectively refusing to make them, despite pressure from the UK government. However, the UK government has sought to recoup the expected savings through a fine on Northern Ireland's block grant, which is calculated according to the Barnett formula, and which fell by 8% in real terms between 2010 and 2015. Research by Oxfam Ireland which was published in 2014 indicated that austerity measures were affecting Northern Ireland disproportionately due to its being one of the UK's most disadvantaged regions with a high dependence on public spending. In 2017 the Conservative‚ÄìDUP agreement resulted in an additional ¬£1 billion of public sector funding for Northern Ireland over two years, with the money focused on the health, infrastructure and education budgets. Reaction During the early years of the austerity programme, many economists argued that the financial changes of the austerity programme should not be undertaken as extensively and as quickly as was done. Osborne, however, argued that without the implementation of the programme in the way that it was, another financial crisis was likely. The rationale behind the need for achieving a balanced budget in the financial climate following the Great Recession has been questioned by some Keynesian economists. Andrew Gamble writing in Parliamentary Affairs in 2015 commented: Ha-Joon Chang, writing in 2017, observed that \\"in today‚Äôs UK economy, whose underlying stagnation has been masked only by the release of excess liquidity on an oceanic scale, some deficit spending may be good ‚Äì necessary, even\\". Some criticism has been based on allegations of economic opportunism, with the government said to have made politically popular cuts rather than those necessary to achieve its long-term aims. Paul Mac Flynn wrote for the Nevin Economic Research Institute in 2015 that: Ben Chu, economics editor of The Independent newspaper, commented that: \\"Austerity, as practiced by Osborne, was essentially a political choice rather than an economic necessity, and the human costs have been huge\\". Economists Alberto Alesina, Carlo A. Favero and Francesco Giavazzi, writing in Finance & Development in 2018, argued that deficit reduction policies based on spending cuts typically have almost no effect on output, and hence form a better route to achieving a reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio than raising taxes. The authors commented that the UK government austerity programme had resulted in growth that was higher than the European average and that the UK's economic performance had been much stronger than the International Monetary Fund had predicted. The United Nations carried out an investigation in 2018 led by Philip Alston, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, into the effect of austerity policies in the UK. Alston concluded that the austerity programme had breached UN human rights agreements relating to women, children, disabled people and economic and social rights. Alston's report described the programme as \\"entrenching high levels of poverty and inflicting unnecessary misery in one of the richest countries in the world\\". Ring-fenced departments Peter Dominiczak (political editor at The Daily Telegraph) wrote that because spending on the NHS and foreign aid is ring-fenced, \\"other Whitehall departments will face savage cuts to their budgets\\". However, some (such as Dr Louise Marshall in The Guardian) have questioned whether the National Health Service (NHS) really is exempt from austerity measures. Public opinion A YouGov poll in 2015 found that whilst 58% of those surveyed viewed austerity as \\"necessary\\", and 48% judged it to be good for economy (compared to 34% who thought it bad for the economy), 50% thought the programme was being carried out \\"unfairly\\". The 2017 British Social Attitudes Survey found that 48% of those surveyed during the previous year wanted higher taxes to pay for more public spending, the first time since 2008 that more people wanted an increase in taxation and spending than opposed it, and the highest proportion to support such measures since 2004. An April 2018 opinion poll by Number Cruncher Politics in the Financial Times found that 66% of British adults, including majorities of all major parties' supporters, thought austerity had \\"gone too far\\". A poll by Survation for the GMB trade union published in spring 2018 found that 62% of respondents wanted the 2018 spring budget to increase spending on public services in real terms, while 48% of those who had voted for the Conservative Party at the 2017 general election thought that austerity had been excessive. Effects on general elections The 2010 UK general election was contested by a Labour Party and a Conservative Party which had both committed themselves to austerity policies. Labour's then-Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling predicted that \\"two parliaments of pain\\" would be necessary to address the UK's budget deficit. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said that Labour's plans implied a cumulative decline of 11.9% in public spending over four years. This would reduce public expenditure by a total of ¬£46 billion in inflation- adjusted terms, taking it from over 27% of the economy to below 21%, back to its level in the late-1990s. The IFS also said that there appeared to be only a modest difference between the plans put forward by the two main political parties. As predicted, neither party won a majority at that year's general election; resulting in the first hung parliament in 36 years, and the Conservative Party forming a coalition government with the centrist Liberal Democrats. At the end of the first full parliament under the austerity programme, Labour and the Conservatives were deadlocked in the polls. At the 2015 UK general election, the Conservatives modified their commitment to austerity with a series of unfunded spending promises, including ¬£8 billion of additional expenditure for the NHS. At the same time, the 2015 Conservative Party general election manifesto proposed making sufficient reductions in public spending and welfare to eliminate the budget deficit entirely by 2018‚Äì19 and run a small budget surplus by 2020. The Labour manifesto proposed the less rigorous objective of reducing the budget deficit every year with the aim of seeing debt as a share of GDP falling by 2020 and achieving a budget surplus \\"as soon as possible\\". This would render the spending reductions proposed by the Conservatives unnecessary, according to some analyses. The Conservatives won the general election with an overall majority for the first time in 23 years, which was unexpected by most polls as they had predicted another hung parliament. Political commentator Patrick Wintour argued that one of the reasons for Labour's loss was its lack of clarity on the cause of the budget deficit. Anti-austerity protests followed the election result, but post-election polling for an independent review conducted by Campaign Company for Labour MP Jon Cruddas indicated that voters in England and Wales did not support an anti-austerity platform, concluding: \\"the Tories did not win despite austerity, but because of it\\". The 2017 UK general election was held almost three years earlier than scheduled under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 in an attempt to increase the Government's majority to facilitate the Brexit process. The Conservative manifesto pledged to eliminate the deficit by the \\"middle of the next decade\\", an aim which the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said would \\"likely require more spending cuts or tax rises even beyond the end of the next parliament\\". Labour's manifesto proposed increasing the Treasury's income by ¬£49 billion per year as a result of taxation rises and increasing public expenditure \\"to its highest sustained level in more than 30 years\\". The IFS said that Labour's proposals \\"could be expected to raise at most ¬£40 billion\\" and that Labour was planning to maintain a majority of the cuts to working-age benefits proposed by the Conservatives. As a result of the election, the Conservatives lost their parliamentary majority, but remained in government as the largest single party in parliament. Gavin Barwell, Theresa May's Downing Street Chief of Staff, blamed anger over Brexit and austerity for the loss of seats. The Labour opposition announced a plan to challenge further austerity measures and vote against them in the House of Commons. A Labour spokesman said: \\"We will be using the changed parliamentary arithmetic to drive home the fact that the Tory programme for five more years of austerity will not go on as before.\\" See also * Anti-austerity movement in the United Kingdom * Austerity * List of recessions in the United Kingdom * Northern Powerhouse * People's Assembly Against Austerity * Premiership of David Cameron * Public Sector Net Cash Requirement * United Kingdom national debt References Category:Politics of the United Kingdom Category:Public finance of the United Kingdom Category:History of the Conservative Party (UK) Category:History of the Liberal Democrats (UK) Category:David Cameron Category:Nick Clegg Austerity programme Category:HM Treasury Category:Austerity ","title":"United Kingdom government austerity programme"},{"id":"34367007","title":"Thank You (Estelle song)"},{"id":"34367016","text":"David Clarke is Deputy Vice-Chancellor and Professor of Law at Bristol University.

He was Head of 20th Century Studies at the Junior Royal College of Music until 1991. He has also been Head of Music for the Royal Shakespeare Company and a BBC Radio 3 producer. He developed a system he called \\"colour muse\\" to help dyslexic children read music. He currently runs the Cherubim Music Trust, a charitable organisation that helps young musicians by loaning them a good quality instrument that they might not otherwise be able to afford. He is married to costume designer Deirdre Clancy. Biography His musical life began as a chorister at Canterbury Cathedral. At 15 he ran away to Paris hoping to study with Olivier Messi√¶n. On returning he built up a large church choir in Kingston Surrey over four years, and studied privately under the guidance of harpsichordist Jane Clark and her husband, composer Stephen Dodgson, which included conducting studies with Nicholas Conran (Surrey U) and Sergiu Celibidache Stockholm. His organ teachers were Allan Wicks (Canterbury Cathedral) and Alan Harverson (RCM). As a harpsichordist Steer was to broadcast on BBCr3 and record with leading baroque music performers such as Roy Goodman, Nancy Hadden, Jeremy Barlow, and tour Europe and the US with various baroque ensembles. In 1974 he recorded Falla's Harpsichord Concerto for Capital Radio on a specially-restored 1920s Pleyel harpsichord and 20 years later played harpsichord in the UK premiere of Stockhausen's Die Jahreslauf with Music Projects /London. In his twenties Mich√¶l Maxwell‚Äôs main interest was writing music for drama. He began as a silent film pianist for the National Film Theatre, London, going to compose and arrange music for more than 120 drama programmes on tv and radio. He was musical director for the opening of two theatres: the Sheffield Crucible and the prototype Bankside Globe Playhouse. He met his stage designer wife Deirdre Clancy on the BBC production Trinity Tales in Birmingham in 1975. The high point of life as a theatre musician was conducting the world premiere of Nicholas Nickleby in 1981, while London Director of Music of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Steer composed extensively for broadcast, including Julius C√¶sar in the BBCtv Complete Shakespeare series, and several series for Thames. After a time as a BBCr3 producer began to concentrate increasingly on original writing, and scripted 25 Drama /Feature programmes for BBC2 and BBCr3/r4, featuring many distinguished artists including David Suchet, Sam Wanamaker, John Wells, Sir Robert Stephens and Elizabeth Spriggs. The Royal National Theatre commissioned A Tormented God, a one-man show for Bob Stephens based on Berlioz‚Äôs M√©moires; and his stage play The Watcher in the Rain, about James Joyce‚Äôs schizophrenic daughter and Jung, was produced in 1991 at the Rose Theatre, London and reviewed in The Guardian as ‚Äòfascinating and unpredictable ... with a wealth of theatrical invention.‚Äô In 1986 Steer and Ian Dearden received an Arts Council commission for an interactive electro- acoustic music drama for children. And as Head of 20thC Studies at the Junior Royal College of Music 1987-1991 he created the RCM‚Äôs first MIDI studio, and pioneered electro-music tuition for young people with a Yamaha-sponsored summer school at UEA. This phase of his life culminated in 1990 with the commission for Notes from Jan√†ƒçek's Diary, an experimental BBCr3 programme for which he was, uniquely, given a studio at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. The result was ‚Äòa kaleidoscope of subtle and bewitching effects.‚Äô (The Times) After 25 years of intense media work, Steer wanted to explore an increasing interest in alternative ideas. He left professional music altogether for 3 years, creating and editinga national green-holistic magazine, CataList. Later, as a result of guest-editing an issue of Contemporary Music Review on Music & Mysticism. Mich√¶l Maxwell organised two large Music & the Psyche conferences at London City U in 1993/4, from which an on-going network of musicians and therapists emerged, and led to a BBCr4 series Music As Sacred Experience. This in turn led to a documentary commission from BBC Religion to visit Sai Baba in India which resulted in two programmes: In Search of Sai Baba and another about the philosophy withinIndian music, which aired on BBC World Service. In the decade to 2003 Steer published extensively on the broader philosophical questions surrounding music, technology and consciousness in a number of journals including AudioMedia, Classical Music, NoiseGate, Diffusion, Analecta Husserliana, Music & Psyche and Quaker journals. ‚ÄòThe Creative Voice‚Äô, about the psychology of inspiration, was published in three separate journals and became a chapter in Raising Our Voices (Handsell 2001). received a ‚ÄòMind‚Äô Award for an audio documentary about Salisbury Hearing Voices Group. For 8 years, until its demise in 2009, Maxwell was Coordinator of the ESP (Ethics/Spirituality/Philosophy) field at the Big Green Gathering on the Mendips, which became a focal point for the exchange of progressive ideas. After the Steer family moved to the Wiltshire village of Tisbury, Michael piano teaching become an integral part of his life. He has pioneered many innovations, notably teaching beginners with ColourMuse, his coloured note method which now sells all over the world. He also uses video‚Äôd concerts in place of exams, with more than 500 pupil performances ‚Äì which greatly stimulates pupil motivation. In 1998 Steer edited and published the complete music of Tisbury‚Äôs most notorious resident, the 18thC author and art collector William Beckford who built the gothick follies of Fonthill Abbey and Lansdown Tower, Bath. Many performances of the works have subsequently been given. After 2001 the focus of Mich√¶l Maxwell‚Äôs life returned to composition, when Meniscus (for two harps) was commissioned to accompany an art exhibition by his friend Chris Jennings at Kingston U‚Äôs Picker Gallery. It was performed by Hugh Webb and Serafina Steer, a harp student at Trinity-Laban who has gone on to achieve her own success as a harpist-singer-songwriter. Steer has written many large-scale acappella choral works, mostly to his own words, several of which have been recorded. Other significant pieces include Sonnets to Orpheus, a cycle of twelve poems by Rilke, recorded by Frances M Lynch ‚Äì with whom he also recorded his Valentine Songs and NightSongs, settings of GM Hopkins. In 2003 Steer‚Äôs opera A Private Passion, about Charles Dickens and Ellen Ternan, was recorded at the London Opera Centre. His most recent one-act opera Unexpectedly Vacant was recorded in 2013. In 2011 Mich√¶l performed his piano duo The Fortress of Illusion at the Chethams International Piano Festival & Summer School with Richard Black. Since 2009 MM Steer has been directing the Cherubim Music Trust, a charity that loans professional-quality orchestral instruments to advanced music students, aged 15‚Äì25, who cannot afford one that matches their ability. In 2013 he formed the Cherubim Young Musicians into an orchestra to perform the music of William Beckford; and in the following two years he directed Cherubim Mozart Weekends in Tisbury featuring Cherubim Young Musicians as soloists. He also runs a monthly concert series at the Savile Club, London.

In fact, Vincent noted he had met Jimmie Crutchfield and liked him. Vincent has gone on to say the Baseball color line which led to good black athletes being excluded from Major League Baseball was ...\\"one of the great insults to a community.\\" The project has managed to seed other gravesite work in the community and in the burial industry. For instance, the wife of Jimmie Crutchfield lay beside him and was also unmarked until the Cemetery donated a marker for Julia Crutchfield. Olivia Taylor, the wife of C.I. Taylor is also on the list for a headstone. Often a headstone, such as the marker for Bill Gatewood\\"For Negro League Players, a Measure of Recognition\\" New York Times, June 30, 2010 was donated by the headstone engraver, which automatically advances the donated money to the next Negro League baseball player headstone. Baseball historian Larry Lester works with Dr. Krock and with other researchers of the Society for American Baseball Research, they have compiled a list of about 3,600 players, their birth dates and death dates, where they are buried, and if they have headstones.

Served as personal representative of Prime Minister Netanyahu in the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange - negotiations for the release of kidnapped IDF soldier Gilad Shalit, and was perceived as bringing closure to the deal. Recently, Meidan was also appointed as special envoy to Turkey in an effort to bring back warm relations between Jerusalem and Ankara. Biography Born in Egypt to Nathan and Rose Mosseri. In 1957 he made Aliyah with his family to Israel. Served in the army in Unit 8200. In the Mossad, he served in part as a Collecting officer in the \\"Tzomet\\" division, responsible for recruiting and activating agents and was responsible for several branches of the Mossad abroad. In 2006 he became head of the Mossad's \\"Tevel\\" division, the branch responsible for External Relations with peer organizations around the world. In his capacity he was involved in activities related to Gilad Shalit, who was captured by Hamas in June 2006. In April 2011 Meidan was appointed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as successor to Hagai Hadas as his representative in the negotiations to release Gilad Shalit, and was a key member of the Israeli delegation who worked with government officials in Egypt outlining the deal for Shalit's release. As part of his role he met with the various parties, and was in touch with the Shalit family. After six months of activity in this position, an agreement between Israel and Hamas was reached, signed on 6 October 2011, in which Shalit was released in return for the release of 1,027 Palestinians terrorists imprisoned in Israel. After the swap-deal was approved by the Government of Israel, Meidan went to Egypt to coordinate the technical arrangements of the swap. He was the first Israeli representative to receive Gilad Shalit at Kerem Shalom border crossing. In November 2011 he was appointed coordinator on behalf of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the issue of POWs and MIAs. Meidan is married to Daphne, and a father of two daughters.

The cast iron coffins or burial cases were popular in the mid‚Äì1800s among wealthier families. While pine coffins in the 1850s would have cost around $2, a Fisk coffin could command a price upwards of $100. Nonetheless, the metallic coffins were highly desirable by more affluent individuals and families for their potential to deter grave robbers. The case was custom-formed to the body, resembling an Egyptian sarcophagus with sculpted arms and a glass window plate for viewing the face of the deceased, without the risk of exposure to odor or pathogens. The airtight cases were valued for their potential to preserve the remains of individuals who died far from home, until they could be shipped back for burial by the family. This type of burial in the 19th century indicated that the individual buried was someone of cultural and societal importance. Manufacturing background The Fisk metallic burial case was designed and patented by Almond D. Fisk under US Patent No. 5920 on November 14, 1848. In 1849, the cast iron coffin was publicly unveiled at the New York State Agricultural Society Fair in Syracuse, New York and the American Institute Exhibition in New York City. In response to the high demand, Fisk established the Fisk and Raymond Company and began production in Providence, Rhode Island. Within the first year of receiving the patent, Fisk set up a small foundry in Winfield Junction in Long Island, New York. In order to keep up with demand, Fisk additionally licensed the right to manufacture the case to two larger firms, including W.C. Davis & Co. of Cincinnati, Ohio and A.C. Barstow & Co. of Providence. In fall 1849, the foundry was destroyed by fire, along with all of company's machinery, tools, and inventory. In an effort to rebuild his business, Fisk borrowed $15,000 from two investors, John G. Forbes, member of the 49th New York State Legislature and Horace White, 37th Governor of the State of New York. The following year, Fisk began experiencing declining health, fully unable to work in fall 1850. At this time, he transferred his patents and business to Forbes and White. Fisk was succeeded by William H. Forbes, son of initial investor, John G. Forbes. In 1875, Fisk's brother-in-law, William M. Raymond, partnered with Forbes and restructured the company as W.M. Raymond & Company. In subsequent years, Syracuse City Attorney, Daniel Phelps Wood, gained controlling interest in W.M. Raymond & Company and made his brother, William S. Wood the foundry's superintendent. In October 1877, the name was changed to the Metallic Burial Case Company. On December 7, 1888, the New York Times reported that the Metallic Burial Case Company was folding. Endorsements In April 1850, former U.S. Vice President and Secretary of State John C. Calhoun was buried in a Fisk coffin at the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, DC. At this time, Jefferson Davis, Henry Clay, and Daniel Webster publicly endorsed the Fisk model, stating that in their opinion, the Fisk was \\"the best article known to us for transporting the dead to their final resting place\\".  Locations  A Fisk coffin can be found on display at the Museum of Appalachia in Clinton, Tennessee.

A baculum of Indarctos arctoides found at Batallones-3. Cerro de los Batallones (Hill of the Battalions) is a hill at Torrej√≥n de Velasco, Madrid, Spain where a number of fossil sites from the Upper Miocene (MN10) have been found. Nine sites have been discovered with predominately vertebrate fossils, invertebrates and plants being less represented. The first deposits were discovered accidentally in July 1991. Batallones-10 (B-10) is considered to contain the oldest representative of fossils. Fossils Nearly the entire proportion of fossils of Batallones-1 were of Carnivorans. The species of sabre-tooth cat known as Promegantereon ogygia and Machairodus aphanistus (the first complete skull) were found at B-1, as was Simocyon a type of red panda. In regards to the saber-tooth cats, Batallones-1 represents an ideal site for recording the percentage of specimens for which breakage of the upper canines occurred. Promegantereon, Machairodus and Paramachairodus are perfect examples of this at Batallones; fossils indicate a high number of canine breaks from where the teeth hit the bones of a struggling victim, indicating these early machairodonts would use their elongated teeth to subdue prey as modern big cats do. A new species of Hispanomys (Rodentia) was found at various sites. A new species of Micromeryx (deer) was found at B-1 and B-10.

In July 1910 the Erbsl√∂h crashed near Leverkusen, killing all five people on board, including Oskar Erbsl√∂h himself. History The Erbsl√∂h was a blimp with a long gondola made from ash. The trim was regulated by pumping water back and forth between two tanks in the bow and aft section of the ship so that the airship adopted a nose up or nose down attitude. The first test flight took place on 20 August 1909. After the airship had been moved out of its hangar, the manoeuvrability was tested for about one hour at a height of on the Leichlingen airship grounds. The official maiden flight was conducted on 1 December 1909, during which the airship successfully flew across Leichlingen and neighbouring towns. On 12 December supporters of the Rheinisch- Westf√§lische Motorluftschiff-Gesellschaft [Rhine-Westphalian Motor Airship Society] participated in a flight. However, a transmission fault forced the Erbsl√∂h to land at Reusrath. When the faulty parts had been repaired, the Erbsl√∂h flew on toward M√∂nchengladbach on the next day. The intermediate stop over there was terminated by a storm which tore the envelope from the gondola, necessitating an extensive repairs. Crash On 13 July 1910, a partly cloudy day, the Erbsl√∂h crashed near Pattscheid (today a quarter of Leverkusen). The cause that was accepted by the subsequent investigation committee was that a sudden exposure of the envelope to the sun after the ship had been flying under cloud cover and cool morning fog had heated the lifting gas, causing it to expand. The relief valves could not vent the developing excess pressure quickly enough. This allowed hydrogen to leak from the envelope and come into contact with sparks from the propulsion system, causing the gas to explode. Witnesses on the ground only heard an explosion: the ship was not visible in the morning fog. The Erbsl√∂h crashed in a field close to Neuenkamp. The front part of the gondola was destroyed, with the torn envelope lying across it. The crew was found dead among the debris. The airship planned to be flown over Leichlingen for only half an hour. In addition to Oskar Erbsl√∂h, crash fatalities included Max von Toelle, Rudolf Kranz, Hans Leo H√∂pp, and mechanic Joseph Spicks. A monument was erected at the \\"Oskar-Erbsl√∂h-Stra√üe\\" [Oskar Erbsl√∂h Road] of Leichlingen in their memory.

Robinson and his family were of Scottish descent like most of Cullybackey's (Protestant) residents. In 1983, Robinson won the British 250cc Championship. In 1986, only 4 weeks prior to his untimely death, he made his indelible mark at the Ulster Grand Prix Formula 1 Race, by achieving an outstanding win, with him placed first, well ahead of the rest of the field. His major achievement on that day was his emphatic victory over his friend Joey Dunlop, who at that time was the newly crowned World Formula 1 Champion. In 1986 Robinson caused a sensation with a commanding victory in the TT Formula 1 race, toppling the mighty Joey Dunlop to win by over one minute. Dunlop retained his world crown nonetheless and later added made amends with a record-breaking win in the TT Classic race, upping the outright lap record to 120.83 mph. Robinson retired with a blown engine. Robinson was a close personal friend of both Joey and Robert Dunlop often travelling to races together. Joey would often help Robinson by passing on knowledge of particular circuits. Robinson was on the threshold of what promised to be a brilliant international career when he became the 13th rider to die on the Oliver's Mount circuit at Scarborough. The twenty-four-year-old was racing at the circuit for the first time and crashed in dense undergrowth and trees on the uphill Quarry Hills section on his sixth lap of practice. He suffered head injuries and a broken leg, and died in the evening in Hull Royal Infirmary in Scarborough after being conveyed there by the racing circuit ambulance escorted by two police motorcycle outriders. Speaking in an interview, prior to his own death in a helicopter accident in 2003, 11 time Isle of Man TT Winner and two-time winner of the British Superbike Championship, Steve 'Hizzy' Hislop, said of Neil Robinson, \\"Smutty, Neil Robinson...if he had not been killed at Scarborough, \\"Smutty\\" would have lifted the roads title away from Joey (Dunlop). Maybe not at the TT, but at the Ulster and the North West 200 for sure. He was mega\\". Robinson's name remains a very popular one among the Northern Ireland road racing / Isle of Man TT fraternity. His racing circuit exploits in such a short period remain unsurpassed. Tragically, Neil's older brother Donny Robinson was killed in a racing accident at the 1999 North West 200 at Coleraine. He crashed heavily at the Mill Road Roundabout during 125cc (wet) practice and died the next morning at Coleraine Hospital from multiple injuries. Forty-five-year-old Donny had retired from a glittering Grand Prix career in 1985 to concentrate on road racing. Like his younger brother, he was a fearless road racer.

Founded in 1981, it is one of the first Brazilian heavy metal bands of note; with reference to their influence on the Latin American black metal scene, Terrorizer reported that \\"many believe that Vulcano not only kick-started musical blasphemy in Brazil, but throughout the whole of Latin America\\".Ganderson, Adam (September 2009). Terrorizers Secret History of Black Metal. \\"World Misanthropy: South America\\", p. 16. . Vulcano is noted as an influence on Sepultura. History Vulcano was launched in 1981 in Santos, S√£o Paulo, Brazil by Zhema Paul Magr√£o and Carli Cooper. Due to their early date of formation, Vulcano is regarded as one of many bands to inaugurate the extreme metal scene in Brazil and Latin America. However, unlike the development of extreme metal scenes in Europe and the United States, Brazil's extreme metal scene did not develop out of much of an existing metal scene, so musicians of early bands like Vulcano had to build a network to promote and support their live performances from scratch. It was also difficult to acquire standard performing equipment.Harris, Keith. \\"'Roots'?: the relationship between the global and the local within the Extreme Metal scene\\", Popular Music, vol. 19, no. 1. The band's first record \\"Om Pushne Namah\\", was released in 1983, and is different from most early extreme metal in that the lyrics were sung in Portuguese, not English. The release of this album also marks the departure of Jose Piloni (drums) from the band. In this early period, it was very difficult to secure live performances, and the band had to produce their own shows, and promotion was limited to pasting up posters, but Vulcano persevered, and moved forward in 1984 to release the demo Devil on My Roof. Vulcano released a live recording Live! in 1985 to gain exposure to a greater audience outside of their home city of Santos. Live! was recorded in August in the city of Americana, without any mixing, and with a lineup of Zhema on bass, Soto Junior on guitar, Z√© Fl√°vio in guitar, drums and Lauder Piloni Angel on vocals. This served as preparation for Vulcano to record Bloody Vengeance, their first studio album, in 1986. In the years following the band released Anthropophagy (1987) and Who Are the True (1988). Throughout this period, Vulcano got access to increasingly better production as the metal scene in Brazil grew further. However, after releasing their fifth album Rat Race in 1990, Vulcano stopped releasing new albums for several years. In this period of reflection the Vulcano still did some live shows, but the only official release from the band was a Cogumelo Records compilation from 2000 with a re- release of the song \\"Bloody Vengeance\\". In December 2001, Vulcano were taken by surprise by the death of Soto Jr. (guitar), who died of high blood pressure. In 2004, Vulcano created its own label Renegados Records and staged a comeback with a new album entitled Tales from the Black Book with Zhema (bass), Angel (vocals), Arthur Von Barbarian (drums), Andre Martins (guitar) and Claudio Passamani (guitar). In 2006 Vulcano released two new songs in a split vinyl titled Thunder Metal with Nifelheim from Sweden, with the songs \\"The Evil Always Return\\" and \\"Suffered Souls\\". In 2009, Vulcano released another album, Five Skulls and One Chalice. In 2010, Angel left the band again. In his place, Vulcano recruited Luiz Carlos Louzada (Hierarchical Punishment, Chemical Disaster) to assist in the band's first tour in Europe, the so-called Bloody Vengeance Tour in Europe 2010, which went through 14 countries, playing 18 shows. In 2011, the band invited Arthur Von Barbarian to resume the sticks and record the album Drowning in Blood, released in September through Renegados Records. In 2013, they released The Man The Key The Beast, and made their third European tour together with the band Nifelheim in the Thunder Metal tour followed by a Brazilian tour and established with Zhema (guitar), Luiz Louzada (vocals), Arthur Von Barbarian and Ivan Pellicciotti The Darkest (bass guitar, who has been also Vulcano's producer since 2005).

After the wedding she abandons her work to dedicate herself to raising their growing family, and he, feeling abandoned by her, begins an amorous relationship with one of his colleagues.

Such activities are heavily restricted in other parts of Singapore. Launch It was launched on 1 September 2000 by the Singapore Government as a venue for \\"free speech area\\" where speaking events could be held without the need to apply for a licence under the Public Entertainments Act (Cap. 257, 1985 Rev. Ed.), now the (\\"PEMA\\"). However, it was necessary for people to register their intention to speak at the venue with a police officer at the Kreta Ayer Neighbourhood Police Post any time within 30 days before the event, though there was no requirement for the police to be informed of the topic of the proposed speech. Other conditions imposed were that speeches had to take place between 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., and the use of sound amplification devices was prohibited. In 2002, exhibitions and performances were permitted to be held at Speakers' Corner. Conditions for the use of Speakers' Corner were further liberalized in 2008. Responsibility for registering people wishing to speak or stage an exhibition or performance was taken over by the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation, and online registration was introduced. It became possible to hold demonstrations provided they are organized by Singapore citizens and the participants are only citizens and permanent residents. Events can now be held around the clock, and self-powered amplification devices like loudhailers may be used between 9:00 a.m. and 10:30 p.m. At present, Speakers' Corner is concurrently regulated by the Parks and Trees Regulations (Cap. 216, Rg. 1, 2006 Rev. Ed.), the Public Entertainments and Meetings (Speakers' Corner) (Exemption) (No. 2) Order 2011 (S 493/2011) (issued under the PEMA) and the Public Order (Unrestricted Area) (No. 2) Order 2011 (S 494/2011) (issued under the (\\"POA\\")). The applicable conditions have remained essentially unchanged. Speakers and demonstration organizers must be Singapore citizens, while participants at demonstrations must be either citizens or permanent residents. Banners, films, flags, photographs, placards, posters, signs, writing or other visible representations or paraphernalia containing violent, lewd or obscene material must not be displayed or exhibited. Persons making speeches must use any of the four official languages of Singapore (English, Malay, Mandarin and Tamil) or related dialects, and organizers of demonstrations must be present throughout the event. Events must not deal with any matter that relates directly or indirectly to any religious belief or to religion generally, or which may cause feelings of enmity, hatred, ill-will or hostility between different racial or religious groups in Singapore. Events adhering to the regulations are not immune from other existing laws such as those relating to defamation and sedition. Articles 14(1)(a) and (b) of the Constitution of Singapore respectively guarantee freedom of speech and expression and freedom of assembly to Singapore citizens. However, the PEMA and POA, which require permits to be obtained before public meetings and assemblies can be held, were enacted pursuant to exceptions to these rights. Article 14(2)(a) provides that Parliament may by law restrict the right to free speech to protect, among other things, Singapore's security and public order, and to prevent incitement to any criminal offence. Under Article 14(2)(b), the right of assembly may also be limited for public order reasons. As Speakers' Corner was intended to increase avenues available for the exercise of free speech, the pieces of subsidiary legislation regulating the venue were issued to provide that public speaking and demonstrations there are not subject to the PEMA and POA if the conditions specified in the subsidiary legislation are complied with. Speakers' Corner has been criticized as a token gesture, though others have pointed to its use by civil society activists as evidence that it has widened the political space in Singapore. Background and establishment Hong Lim Park was chosen as the location for Speakers' Corner as, among other reasons, it was a historical venue for political speeches and rallies Singapore's political model has been described as a representative democracy,. and Singaporeans have constitutional rights to freedom of speech and assembly under Articles 14(1)(a) and (b) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore.. The constitutional rights to free speech and assembly extend only to Singapore citizens. Hence, the Singapore Court of Appeal has held that non- citizens enjoy only common law free speech.Review Publishing Co. Ltd. v. Lee Hsien Loong [2010] 1 S.L.R. [Singapore Law Reports] 52 at 171, para. 257, Court of Appeal (Singapore). Articles 14(1)(a) and (b) are then subject to Articles 14(2)(a) and (b) which allow Parliament to impose, by law, restrictions on the rights to freedom of speech and assembly. The grounds for restrictions are, for freedom of speech, Singapore's security, friendly relations with other states, public order, public morality, protecting parliamentary privilege, defamation, contempt of court and incitement to any criminal offence;Thio, p. 516. and for freedom of assembly, public order only. These restrictions made it a lengthy and difficult process to obtain the licence required to address a public gathering. In response to these free speech concerns, Speakers' Corner was created as local adaptation of the Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park, London, in 2000. In a 1999 interview with New York Times columnist William Safire, the Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said the idea had first been suggested by the Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, but Goh felt that it was not yet the right time to set it up.. The following year, the Government decided to go ahead despite its fear of potential public disorder, as the idea enjoyed widespread support from the public and civil society groups.. During a Parliamentary debate on the issue on 25 April 2000, opposition Member of Parliament Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam asked the Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng whether this was a \\"mere show\\" or whether the Government was serious about promoting free speech in Singapore. If the latter, he asked if the Minister would agree to an open debate with the Workers' Party of Singapore outside Parliament.. In response, Wong said there was nothing to prevent Jeyaretnam from making a speech at Speakers' Corner, but that the public forum for a proper policy debate was in Parliament: Speakers' Corner was launched on 1 September 2000. at Hong Lim Park, a historical venue for political speeches and rallies.. The park's proximity to the Kreta Ayer Neighbourhood Police Post (NPP) also made it convenient for people to register to speak at the venue.Wong, \\"Speakers' Corner\\", cols. 21‚Äì22. In the first nine months, more than a thousand speeches were made.. Regulations governing usage Previous regulations Speakers' Corner was established by the issuance of the Public Entertainments (Speakers' Corner) (Exemption) Order 2000,Public Entertainments (Speakers' Corner) (Exemption) Order 2000 (S 364/2000) (\\"2000 PEA Order\\"), in force on 1 September 2000. which exempted people wishing to speak in Hong Lim Park from the need to apply for a licence under the Public Entertainments Act.Public Entertainments Act (Cap. 257, 1985 Rev. Ed.), now the (\\"PEMA\\"). Speakers had to be Singapore citizens,2000 PEA Order, para. 3. as the Government was concerned that the venue should not be used by foreigners \\"to pursue their own agenda whether in respect of their own domestic issues, or those of other countries, including Singapore's\\".Wong, \\"Speakers' Corner\\", col. 23 They also had to register their intention to speak with a police officer at the Kreta Ayer NPP any time within 30 days before the public speaking,2000 PEA Order, paras. 3(a) and 4(1). although there was no need to inform the police of the topic of the proposed speech. However, speakers were not permitted to deal with any matter which related either directly or indirectly to any religious belief or to religion generally, or which might cause feelings of enmity, hatred, ill-will or hostility between different racial or religious groups in Singapore.2000 PEA Order, para. 3(c). Chee Soon Juan On 15 February 2002, while at Speakers' Corner, Singapore Democratic Party chief Chee Soon Juan attacked the Government's decision to suspend four Muslim girls for wearing the tudung (Islamic headscarf) to public schools. Contrary to police advice, he chose not to apply for a public entertainment licence, arguing he did not need one. Chee's speech sparked heated exchanges involving the Sikh practice of wearing turbans.; . In July, Chee was convicted and fined S$3,000 for speaking without the required licence. In his judgment, District Judge Kow Keng Siong emphasized the twin considerations of public order and national security in multi-racial and multi-religious Singapore, finding that Chee's speech had bred social unrest.; ; ; . Under the Constitution of Singapore, a person who has been fined at least $2,000 cannot stand for election to Parliament for five years., Art. 45(1)(e). As a result of the incident, Chee was barred from contesting the 2006 general elections.. Other conditions imposed on a speech at Speakers' Corner were that it had to take place only between 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. on the date notified by the person to the police,2000 PEA Order, para. 3(b). had to be in any of Singapore's four official languages (English, Malay, Mandarin or Tamil) or any related dialects,2000 PEA Order, para. 3(d). and the use of sound amplification devices was prohibited.2000 PEA Order, para. 3(e). The latter restriction was justified on the grounds that it would reduce noise pollution and prevent one speaker from drowning out another one, and that it also applied to Speakers' Corner in London.Wong, \\"Speakers' Corner\\", col. 24. In 2002, exhibitions and performances were also permitted to be held at Speakers' Corner. The conditions that organizers and participants had to adhere to were broadly similar to those applying to speeches. In addition, the organizer or an authorized agent had to be present at all times during the exhibition or performance,Public Entertainments and Meetings (Speakers' Corner) (Exemption) Order (Cap. 257, O 3, 2002 Rev.

Ed.), reg. 8(3), archived from the original on 13 September 2010, inserted by the Parks and Trees (Amendment) Regulations 2008 (S 425/2008). To provide greater convenience, the National Parks Board made it possible for people to register online at its website.. The web page for registration is https://www.nparks.gov.sg/speakers-corner- application-form. In addition, it became possible to hold demonstrations provided that they are organized by Singapore citizens and the participants are only citizens and permanent residents.2008 PEMA Order, para. 3(3). See also . As the time period restriction was lifted, events can now be held around the clock. In addition, rules on voice amplification were revised to allow the use of self-powered amplification devices like loudhailers from 9:00 a.m. to 10:30 p.m., para. 3(g). This relaxation of the rules potentially allows for speakers' messages to be heard by larger audiences. A minor change was also introduced to the conditions for the use of Speakers' Corner ‚Äì no banner, film, photograph, placard or poster containing any violent, lewd or obscene material may be displayed or exhibited whether before, during or after the event.2008 PEMA Order, paras. 3(1)(d), 3(2)(e) and 3(3)(e). In the first month after public demonstrations were permitted at Speakers' Corner, 11 out of the 31 applications received were indicated as being public protests.. Hearers of Cries, a group concerned with the plight of abused maids, became the first group to hold a public outdoor demonstration at Speakers' Corner.. The Public Order Act, (\\"POA\\"). intended to regulate public assemblies and processions and to introduce new powers for the preservation of public order, came into force on 9 October 2009. On the same day, the Public Order (Unrestricted Area) Order 2009 (\\"2009 POA Order\\")Public Order (Unrestricted Area) Order 2009 (S 491/2009) (\\"2009 POA Order\\"), in force on 9 October 2009. made pursuant to the Act declared that Speakers' Corner was an unrestricted area in which assemblies and processions could be held without the need for a police permit.2009 POA Order, para. 2. Thus, at present, Speakers' Corner is concurrently regulated by the Parks and Trees Regulations, and by exemption orders issued under the PEMA and POA. The conditions under which addresses, debates, demonstrations, discussions, lectures and talks (whether or not together with any exhibition, performance, play-reading or recital), must be held have remained essentially unchanged. Speakers and demonstration organizers must be Singapore citizens, while participants in demonstrations must be either citizens or permanent residents.2008 PEMA Order, paras. 3(1) and 3(2)(a); 2009 POA Order, paras. 3(1)(a), 4(1)(a) and 4(1)(aa), amended by the Public Order (Unrestricted Area) (Amendment) Order 2009 (S 547/2009). Banners, films, flags, photographs, placards, posters, signs, writing or other visible representations or paraphernalia containing violent, lewd or obscene material must not be displayed or exhibited.2008 PEMA Order, paras. 3(1)(d) and 3(2)(e); 2009 POA Order, paras. 3(1)(d) and 4(1)(d). Persons making speeches must use any of the four official languages of Singapore or related dialects,2008 PEMA Order, para. 3(1)(c); 2009 POA Order, para. 3(1)(c). and organizers of demonstrations must be present throughout the event.2008 PEMA Order, para. 3(2)(c); 2009 POA Order, para. 4(1)(c). In January 2008, the Complaints Choir, a vocal group participating in the M1 Singapore Fringe Festival 2008, was denied the chance to perform at Speakers' Corner and other outdoor venues unless the six foreigners in the group of 50 did not participate in the performance... As the choir did not wish to be split up in any way, it decided not to go ahead with the performance.. Queried on the matter in Parliament, the Minister for Communication, Information and the Arts Dr. Lee Boon Yang stated that the Government did not think it \\"desirable or good precedent\\" for \\"foreigners [to come] here to organise and to lead Singaporeans to complain about our domestic issues\\".; see also . Crucially, events held at Speakers' Corner must not deal with any matter that relates directly or indirectly to any religious belief or to religion generally, or which may cause feelings of enmity, hatred, ill-will or hostility between different racial or religious groups in Singapore.2008 PEMA Order, paras. 3(1)(b) and 3(2)(d); 2009 POA Order, paras. 3(1)(b) and 4(1)(b). On 19 September 2008, Thamiselvan Karuppaya, an Indian real estate agent who wished to speak at Speakers' Corner about the use of Tamil on public signs, had to change his plans after being informed by the police that he required a permit as the topic of his speech was racially sensitive.. A subsequent application for a permit was turned down..See also . A contravention of the regulations renders speakers and organizers of demonstrations liable to fines of up to $10,000,2009 POA Order, paras. 3(2) and 4(2); POA, s. 15(1).PEMA, s. 19(1). or incarceration of up to six months. The penalty for displaying anything violent, lewd or obscene at a demonstration is a fine not exceeding $3,000 or, on a subsequent conviction, $5,000.2009 POA Order, para. 4(3). Events which adhere to the regulations are also not immune from other existing laws such as those relating to defamation and sedition.2008 PEMA Order, para. 4; 2009 POA Order, para. 5. In 2011, the regulations creating Speakers' Corner were suspended and then restored twice: first for the purpose of the campaigning period during the general election,See the , s. 80A(2), the Public Entertainments and Meetings (Speakers' Corner) (Exemption) (Revocation) Order 2011 (S 207/2011) and the Public Order (Unrestricted Area) (Revocation) Order 2011 (S 208/2011). Following the election, Speakers' Corner's status as a no- permit-required zone was restored by the Public Entertainments and Meetings (Speakers' Corner) (Exemption) Order 2011 (S 249/2011) and the Public Order (Unrestricted Area) Order 2011 (S 250/2011). and subsequently for the presidential election., s. 62A(2), the Public Entertainments and Meetings (Speakers' Corner) (Exemption) (Revocation) (No. 2) Order 2011 (S 469/2011) and the Public Order (Unrestricted Area) (Revocation) (No. 2) Order 2011 (S 470/2011). Speakers' Corner was reinstated by the Public Entertainments and Meetings (Speakers' Corner) (Exemption) (No. 2) Order 2011 (S 493/2011) and the Public Order (Unrestricted Area) (No. 2) Order 2011 (S 494/2011). Relation to the rights to free speech and assembly James Gomez: Singaporeans lack a \\"culture of speaking\\" In his 2008 National Day Rally speech, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong indicated that the purpose behind various government policies, including the creation of Speakers' Corner, was to \\"liberalise our society, to widen the space for expression and participation\\".. Its reception was mixed, however, and there have been a wide range of views and perspectives on the impact of Speakers' Corner in increasing the space for free speech and the freedom to assemble. It has been called an \\"exercise in tokenism\\" for the purpose of preserving a literal \\"space\\" for engaging in free speech while also \\"cornering\\" it in that space.Thio, p. 522. This is reflected in the relative lack of progress towards liberalization in other areas such as awards of high damages in libel lawsuits brought by politicians which has been said to have a chilling effect on political speech in Singapore.. Former Workers' Party member James Gomez has also expressed concerns about the effectiveness of the Speakers' Corner as a site of vibrant political debate, citing the lack of a \\"culture of speaking\\" amongst Singaporeans.. The ban on racially or religiously sensitive speech has been criticized as possibly curtailing free speech on genuine political matters and limiting the scope of constitutionally entrenched fundamental liberties.Thio, p. 520. Despite such criticisms, some social activist groups remain optimistic that Speakers' Corner represents a step towards political liberalization and the promise of a wider political space.. Although Dr. Kenneth Paul Tan, Assistant Dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, has noted that initial cynicism was inevitable as Speakers' Corner was a top- down initiative, he recognizes that civil society activists have since actively occupied and made use of Speakers' Corner to generate public interest in various social and political issues. This view is shared by Professor Bilveer Singh, a political science analyst at the National University of Singapore, who has pointed to large turnouts at events organized at Speakers' Corner as evidence that Singaporeans are \\"not fearful and not politically apathetic.\\" The government has also shown itself to be sensitive to calls for greater liberalisation on the ground, with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong acknowledging incremental changes to the rules and regulations at Speakers' Corner to be necessary for \\"more citizens to engage in debate\\" and to \\"progressively open up our system even more\\". Developments In 2008, Speakers' Corner was the scene for meetings held over several weeks by Tan Kin Lian, former chief executive of insurance company NTUC Income, to advise people of their legal recourse after structured products they had purchased became virtually valueless upon the collapse of Lehman Brothers.. On 23 January 2009 during an event at Speakers' Corner, the National Solidarity Party gave its views on the national budget one day after it was announced, criticizing the Government for not doing enough to assist unemployed breadwinners during the recession.. The Party's secretary-general, Ken Sunn, said the event was to let Singaporeans \\"participate, speak and hear various views and opinions on the Singapore Government's 2009 Budget statement, and discuss ways to improve our Singapore Economy\\".. The first public rally by the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community in Singapore, called Pink Dot SG, was held on 16 May 2009. Estimates of the number of people who attended ranged from 1,000 to 2,500 people.; . Held every year since, the event was attended by 28,000 people in 2015.. On 31 May 2009, more than a hundred people attended a demonstration at Speakers' Corner organized by human rights advocacy group Maruah to call for Myanmar's military junta to release Aung San Suu Kyi. Participants from Myanmar were requested to remain outside a cordoned-off area since only Singaporeans and permanent residents may attend demonstrations at Speakers' Corner.; . A surveillance camera on the grounds of the Telok Ayer Hong Lim Green Community Centre next to Speakers' Corner. The centre does not form part of Speakers' Corner. In July 2009, the police installed closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras for \\"safety and security\\". The police said that the cameras complemented the presence of their officers on the ground and did not record audio inputs. The move drew some negative reactions from the public. Former Nominated Member of Parliament Siew Kum Hong felt that the installation of CCTV cameras was \\"pretty ridiculous\\", and wondered if the move might feed the perception in some quarters that Singapore is a police state, since Speakers' Corner is \\"the one place in Singapore\\" where people can demonstrate.. Nevertheless, the surveillance cameras have not affected various events from being held. With effect from 1 December 2009, the size of Speakers' Corner was reduced so that it only occupies the half of Hong Lim Park nearer New Bridge Road.The change was effected by the Public Entertainments and Meetings (Speakers' Corner) (Exemption) (Amendment No. 2) Order 2009 (S 584/2009) and the Public Order (Unrestricted Area) (Amendment No. 2) Order 2009 (S 585/2009). From 1 March 2012, Speakers' Corner was expanded to include an area behind Kreta Ayer NPP, near the junction of North Canal Road and South Bridge Road.By the Public Entertainments and Meetings (Speakers' Corner) (Exemption) (Amendment) Order 2012 (S 80/2012) and the Public Order (Unrestricted Area) (Amendment) Order 2012 (S 81/2012). A commemorative birthday memorial was organized for J.B. Jeyaretnam, the late leader of the opposition Reform Party, at Speakers' Corner on 5 January 2010.. At the event, several opposition politicians shared with the public their experiences with Jeyaretnam.; . In September 2010, Today newspaper reported that statistics from the National Parks Board indicated that the number of groups registering to stage events at Speakers' Corner had fallen from 39 between September 2008 and August 2009, to nine between September 2009 and August 2010. The number of individuals registering dropped from 102 to 57 during the same periods. Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, who was Prime Minister when Speakers' Corner was set up, expressed the view that its use had declined because there were now other avenues for people to express themselves such as the Internet (including the Government's online feedback portal Reach), newspapers, and radio and television channels. Also, people might feel that the venue is not always the best place \\"to meaningfully and constructively press their views on issues\\". He saw Speakers' Corner as \\"playing the same role as envisaged ‚Äì mostly dormant but good to have\\". On 30 November 2013, the first public rally by the special needs community in Singapore, called The Purple Parade, was held. The event attracted 4,000 participants. The event has been held every year since, with the event moved to the Fountain of Wealth in Suntec City in 2016.

Ray is an ex-partner of character Bianca Butcher (Patsy Palmer) and the father of her son Morgan Butcher (Devon Higgs). He made his first on screen appearance on 10 January 2012. His storylines have involved meeting and getting to know Morgan, a relationship with Kim Fox (Tameka Empson) and starting a youth mentoring scheme. On 16 April 2013 it was announced that Venn had been written out of the show, and departed on 28 May 2013. He appeared in 107 episodes. Storylines Ray is first mentioned in the episode broadcast on 9 January 2012, when Morgan asks about his father and Bianca says it is Barack Obama. Bianca's adopted daughter, Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), knowing the truth, attempts to contact Ray. Whitney takes Morgan to meet Ray the next day, and he soon comes to Walford to see Morgan. He saves Kim Fox (Tameka Empson) from a falling ladder, and she is attracted to him. Bianca soon realises that Whitney has taken Morgan to meet Ray, but does not want them to see each other, and Kim is disappointed to learn that Ray has a son. Whitney soon convinces Bianca to let Morgan see Ray again. Ray returns shortly after, wanting to spend more time with his son and offering to cook a meal for Bianca's family, although when Ray reveals he has a daughter, Sasha Dixon (Rebecca Sanneh), Bianca throws him out. He successfully gets a job as a barman and chef at The Queen Victoria public house. On his first day, Sasha arrives meets Morgan and Kim. Ray asks Kim out on a date, but Bianca is angry so takes Morgan out, and Kim tells Ray she has had enough of men with \\"baggage\\". Ray continues to pursue Kim but she insists she is busy. Ray tells Bianca he wishes he could have been there for Morgan and how he changed his priorities for Sasha. Bianca misreads his kindness and goes to kiss him, but he turns away. When Ray discovers that Bianca is struggling with money, he gives her ¬£300, saying it is for back-payments for Morgan. He starts to get somewhere with Kim but she suddenly leaves. He later hears from Kim's sister Denise Fox (Diane Parish) that Kim has caught head lice, so he gives Kim a hat to wear and they finally kiss. Kim becomes jealous when Ray playfights with Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) and later when he flirts with Bianca. As a result, she accidentally slices off the top of Ray's finger when he tries to help her fillet some fish. She accompanies him to the hospital where they open up to one another and decide to start a relationship. After Bianca is imprisoned, her mother Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) decides to move with Bianca's children closer to the prison. Ray realises he cannot make Morgan choose between him and his mother, so allows him to leave. Ray then invites Sasha to stay with him, but Kim says she cannot take on his children. However, Kim is soon forced to look after Sasha, which pleases Ray. Kim and Ray then declare their love for one another. Ray is thrilled when Morgan returns for the wedding of his aunt, Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks). He bickers with Morgan's adoptive father, Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) over his parenting methods, but the pair reconcile when Morgan gets upset and Ray thanks Ricky for bringing Morgan up in his absence. Ray moves into Kim's bed and breakfast when his landlord increases his rent. Kim tells Sasha she can organise some work experience for her with a forensic scientist. She later admits this was a lie, leading to Ray moving out. Kim then gets Sasha a placement with Les Coker's (Roger Sloman) firm of funeral directors, and Ray and Kim make up. Ray becomes secretive and Kim suspects he is having an affair. She then finds information about local flats and assumes that Ray is looking for somewhere for them both to live. However, Ray reveals that the flat is for Sasha's mother, Deanne, so they can both be closer to Sasha. Kim feels upset and humiliated. However, he affirms his love for her and they reconcile. Ray is angry when a police officer stops him, suspecting him of a mugging. Ray claims that the police officer is being racist, but feels he cannot do anything about it, until Kim and Denise urge him to become a mentor for children facing similar circumstances. With funding from Sport England, he successfully starts his mentoring scheme, \\"Fighting Fit\\", at the local boxing club. When Denise is feeling sad about being single, Ray compliments and kisses her. He thinks Denise has told Kim, so says Denise kissed him, leading to Kim and Denise falling out after Kim slaps her. Ray then ends his relationship with Kim, saying they are too different, but she continues to send text messages in the hope they will reconcile. Ray flirts with Kirsty Branning (Kierston Wareing), upsetting Kim. A few months later, Ray learns that Sasha's mother has been in an accident. Kim and Ray start talking when she asks a favour for her bed and breakfast, while he struggles to cope with caring for Sasha and working at the pub. Kim helps Ray by cooking him dinner, which leads to them kissing. They resume their relationship, but Ray decides to leave Walford and his job to be closer to Sasha. Kim agrees to come with him, but at her birthday party, she realises that Ray does not know her very well, so she breaks up with him moments before they are due to leave together, and Ray leaves alone. Creation and development Casting Venn heard from a friend that EastEnders were looking to cast Ray, and said that he thought \\"I could play that guy!\\" so contacted his agent to be put forward for the part. His agent told him that the producers were already interested in him for the part. Venn had previously worked with actor Jamie Foreman, who plays Derek Branning in the series, and when he discovered that Foreman was a part of the show, it made him more determined to get the part of Ray. He prepared 12 pages of his own back story for the character and imagined Ray's life as a child. Venn was eventually cast in the series, and was contracted for six months. Venn started filming in November 2011. The character and casting were then announced on 15 November 2011. Venn was a fan of EastEnders since he was about 12 years old, so he felt it was \\"a real privilege to now be a part of television history.\\" He said of his casting, \\"I have had the pleasure of working on many great productions with fantastic artistes such as Morgan Freeman and I have to say working on EastEnders feels like it is up there with the best of them. EastEnders is etched in British history and it is an honour and a pleasure to be part of it.\\" The first scenes that Venn filmed were with Shona McGarty (Whitney Dean), and Venn stated that it felt like \\"the first day at school\\". Characterisation and backstory Ray is a former army soldier, which Venn said taught him \\"discipline and how to handle himself in certain situations.\\" He also said it makes Ray \\"strategic and tactical\\". Venn hoped that Ray's army past would catch up with him in a storyline. Venn has described him as \\"a noble fella\\" and \\"a man of principles [who] wants to honour his parental duties to the end, no matter what.\\" He also said \\"Ray's a very honourable man, and committed to his children.\\" Additionally, when Venn auditioned for the part, the character was pitched to him as \\"a charming family man and someone the ladies admire.\\" Ray is described as \\"a good guy\\" who enjoys the gym, the pub and watching football matches. He had a hard childhood, but was loved by his mother and grandparents. From his grandmother he gained a love of Caribbean food and from his grandfather he took \\"a special kind of optimism\\". He got a girl from his estate pregnant before joining the army, which resulted in the birth of his daughter Sasha Dixon. Ray sees Sasha as \\"being the best thing in his life, but he wishes her mother didn't exist.\\" Ray works as a pub chef, which he has done in various cities. He has no problems with women but is described as \\"a love 'em and leave 'em type.\\" Inside Soap called him \\"cocky\\". Notable relationships Bianca and Morgan Ray's relationship with Bianca (Patsy Palmer, pictured) was described as \\"fraught\\". Ray and Bianca had a relationship when she was living in Manchester, and he fell in love with her but it ended when she met Tony King and stole money from Ray. Bianca never told Ray that she had become pregnant by him. A source from EastEnders confirmed: \\"Ray hasn't seen Bianca for years and they didn't part on good terms. He meets Whitney as he has matters with Bianca that are unresolved. But Ray gets the shock of his life when Whitney tells him all about Morgan‚Äîand she soon realises that Ray knew nothing about his son.\\" Ray's introduction to EastEnders was said to fill \\"another piece of the puzzle\\" of Bianca's life, as previously nothing about Morgan's paternity was known. The relationship between Ray and Bianca was described as \\"fraught\\". Venn described the relationship as \\"fiery\\" and explained that Ray respects Bianca, and said that there was a possibility of them reuniting. Venn told All About Soap that when Ray meets Morgan for the first time, he has mixed emotions because although he has met his son, Morgan does not know who he is, and thinks he is meeting Barack Obama. Venn opined that it would be \\"cathartic\\" for Ray, saying he would be sad as he has missed out on seven years of Morgan's life, and said that when they first meet, \\"it's a lovely moment [for] the two of them\\". An EastEnders insider explained that Ray is desperate to be a part of Morgan's life, and would do whatever it takes to be with him, even move to Albert Square, where Morgan's family are. Venn opined that Ray would strive to be a good father, saying \\"[he]'d take his parental responsibilities very seriously\\". After Bianca goes to prison in May 2012, Venn told Inside Soap that \\"Ray will do everything in his power to keep Morgan in his life\\". Kim and Denise Tameka Empson (pictured) plays Ray's love interest, Kim Fox. Discussing the storyline in which Ray asks Kim out on a date but she plays hard to get, an EastEnders insider told the Daily Star Sunday that \\"Kim absolutely fancies the pants off Ray but she's got to calm herself down. She wants to get this one right so she decides the best way is to play hard to get. Ray sees straight through her and rather enjoys winding her up. She's a little firecracker as far as he's concerned and he likes it. These two are going to provide quite a bit of comedy as they get to know each other. Kim believes it's her destiny to have a fit man on her arm and she may well have met her match in Ray. It's going to be a fun few weeks for her and everyone is excited at the prospect of these two becoming a couple. They have real on-screen chemistry.\\" Kim plays hard to get with Ray for a number of weeks, until Ray admits his feelings for her in scenes broadcast in April 2012. Up until then, they argue a lot, which a writer for All About Soap insisted was sexual tension. An EastEnders insider told Inside Soap, \\"Pairing up Kim and Ray initially creates fireworks of entirely the wrong kind! But there's definitely something there, and [their colleagues] can see plain as day that they're meant to be together.\\" Venn said in May 2012 that pairing up Kim and Ray creates \\"a dynamic comedic duo [which] brings comedic spice to the show.\\" Empson said in a May 2012 interview with Inside Soap that Kim did not consider Ray's children when she started flirting with him, but \\"She's been very honest with him about her feelings. but if you really like somebody, then you have to take the whole package.\\" She went on to say that Kim and Ray \\"make a good couple\\" and that \\"Kim wants a bit of security, and her own family. Ray's a man's man, and she really thinks he could be a long-term love for her. That's why she did things differently with him, and didn't rush in. [...] With Ray, she's keeping her cards very close to her chest.\\" Continuing, she explained that Ray is \\"something different\\" for Kim because he's \\"a decent guy\\", adding \\"I think she and Ray really complement each other‚Äîhe's livened up a bit by her, while she learns a lot from him.\\" Finally, she said that Ray likes that Kim is \\"her own woman. So together they made a really good team. Someone once said that Kim and Ray are like the Posh and Becks of Walford.\\" Venn said that he thought it was \\"nice\\" for Ray to propose marriage to Kim, saying, \\"I imagine they would have a conventional wedding, then a reception with 70s fancy dress. [...] I'm sure nothing would be straightforward.\\" He also said he would like to see them have a baby together, as it would be \\"interesting to see how Kim tackled being a mother.\\" Empson said that if they were to get engaged, Kim would need a big ring, and Venn teased that Ray may have got the ring, since viewers were to see \\"the other side of Ray\\". In December 2012, pictures emerged in the press of Ray kissing Kim's sister Denise Fox (Diane Parish). It was unknown at the time if it would lead to a relationship or remain a one-off. Venn praised the storyline, saying \\"Obviously it's about layers and showing the different sides of my character, so for me, this is a wonderful challenge. As an actor, I love challenges so I'm looking forward to seeing how this storyline develops. I think Kim would be quite peeved if she found out!\\" Venn explained Ray's reasons for kissing Denise, saying, \\"Ray reaches a point where he needs to come up for a breath of air, as there's only so much of Kim's heightened personality he can bear. Did Ray go for the wrong sister? Who knows? He probably has more in common with Denise than he ever had with Kim.\\" He said that he felt bad about Ray kissing Denise because he is close to Empson and her character has been Ray's partner for about 10 to 11 months, and said it was \\"really weird\\" to film the kiss with Denise. The kiss, shown in January 2013, leads to Ray and Kim's relationship ending. Other relationships In an early storyline, Ray takes a disliking to Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) when he stores illegal alcohol in the basement of The Queen Victoria. In May 2012, Venn opined that tension between Derek and Ray \\"could come to a head at some point soon. There's only so much one man can take, especially when it comes to racial abuse. [Ray will] know exactly when to attack, and won't hold back.\\" Venn also said he could imagine Sasha's mother appearing on screen, saying, \\"EastEnders likes to keep you guessing, and I think that's a storyline with legs.\\" Possible affair with Kat Moon In June 2012, it was announced that Kat Moon, played by Jessie Wallace, would embark on a long-running mystery affair with another Albert Square resident. The identity of the mystery man was kept secret from both cast and crew, as well as viewers, and all scenes of Kat with her lover were filmed with an extra. After the storyline was announced, Ray was announced as one of five suspects as potential love interests for Kat, along with, Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd), Max Branning (Jake Wood), Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) and Jack Branning (Scott Maslen). Speaking of the storyline, executive producer Lorraine Newman said: \\"The consequences are not only great for Kat and Alfie, but also for each individual suspect. The audience will join the cast and crew guessing across the summer and autumn as we eliminate the suspects one at a time, leading to one almighty explosion.\\" Asked about the possibility that Ray could be Kat's lover, Venn said that \\"Kat's a saucy minx, and what man wouldn't want to get involved with her? Ray is a loyal, caring father‚Äîbut we all have our dark sides. There's a lot the audience hasn't seen yet, put it that way.\\" Daniel Kilkelly from entertainment website Digital Spy said that Ray appears to be a \\"decent family guy\\" and may not be the top suspect, but he is very flirtatious and his chef's job in The Queen Victoria, where Kat is landlady, would give him the perfect opportunity. However, he questioned the likelihood of Ray cheating on Kim. Ray was eliminated as a suspect in the episode broadcast on 7 August 2012, when he catches Kat on the phone to her lover. Youth mentoring storyline In September 2012, viewers see Ray become a victim of racial profiling by the police, and Kim suggests that Ray channel his negativity into mentoring youths. Venn spoke on This Morning, confirming that Ray would indeed start such a scheme. Venn praised the storyline and the fact that the character could show a more serious side, saying, \\"For me, of course, I was very impressed by EastEnders for even making the choice to tackle such a pertinent, very relevant issue. It felt very close to my heart.\\" He went on to say that Ray would \\"help empower [youths], so they can equip themselves in situations similar to that‚Äî[to have] a bit more self- respect, know how to carry themselves and not deal with it in a violent or aggressive manner.\\" Venn then stated that the storyline could establish Ray as \\"a more well-rounded character\\", saying, \\"It's about levels. There's different sides to every individual. It's nice that EastEnders have given me the opportunity to allow Ray to show the other sides. It just shows versatility.\\" Departure On 16 April 2013, it was announced that Venn was leaving the show, with Ray making his final appearance in May, as producers had decided to write him out. Venn stated: \\"Working on EastEnders has been one of my career highlights and an invaluable experience. I couldn't have asked for a better team to work with and have found a lifelong friend in my on-screen partner Tameka [Empson]. I want to thank everyone who supported me on the show.\\" Reception Initial praise for Ray was based on his looks. A writer for All About Soap magazine described Ray as \\"hunky\\", \\"good-looking\\" and said that \\"this mysterious man might have everything going for him.\\" Laura Morgan of All About Soap said that Ray's inclusion \\"ticks the hunky-man box very nicely\\". In a feature about \\"the boys of soapland who'll be lighting up our screens in the coming months\\", a writer for Inside Soap said in May 2012, \\"It's rare to meet a truly good man in soap. They generally come laden with baggage, burdened with dark secrets and‚Äîalmost always‚Äîhave the same attitude to monogamy as a cocker spaniel on heat. But Ray seems to be cut from a different cloth, and we love him for it.\\" In May 2012, Venn was nominated in the Best Newcomer category at the 2012 TVChoice Awards for his portrayal of Ray, but was not shortlisted for the award. He was then nominated in July 2012 for Best Newcomer at the 2012 Inside Soap awards.

He was a staunch proponent of Bosnian (or Bosniak) national identity, while being an active member of the Illyrian Movement. Early life and education Born in Varcar Vakuf (today Mrkonjiƒá Grad) in 1834, his father Anto came from the town of Uskoplje, and his mother was Agata Stipiƒá (n√©e Ivekiƒá) from Varcar Vakuf. His father died early and he was raised by his uncle from his father's side, Fra Grgo Kne≈æeviƒá, who was buried in Ivanjska village. Fra Antun Kne≈æeviƒá studied in Fojnica, Rome, and Siena and became friar on 26 April 1851. His first Mass was on 21 September 1856. Views, opinions and engagements Antun Kne≈æeviƒá was one of the main proponents of Bosniak nationhood, and he fiercely advocated against imminent Croatization of Bosnian Catholics on one side, as well as imminent Serbianization of Bosnian Orthodox people on the other, as he called them Catholic Bosniaks and Orthodox Bosniaks in his work. His position and doctrine was that all Bosnians or Bosniaks are one people of three faiths, and that up to the late 19th century no Croats and Serbs lived in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Although Fra Antun Kne≈æeviƒá was not a unique phenomenon in this sense, he was certainly among the most articulate, having a strong impact along with Fra Ivan Franjo Jukiƒá from whom he took the idea, and who was his teacher and mentor earlier in his life. Since the 17th century many other members of Franciscan order in Bosnia accepted the idea of a Bosniak identity, nurturing it within the brotherhood and carrying it over into the 18th and 19th century.Zemljopis i poviestnica Bosne by Ivan Frano Jukiƒá as Slavoljub Bo≈°njak, Zagreb, 1851, UDC 911.3(497.15)Putpisi i istorisko-etnografski radovi by Ivan Frano Jukiƒá as Slavoljub Bo≈°njak ASIN: B004TK99S6 But it was these two, Fra Kne≈æeviƒá and his mentor, Fra Jukiƒç, who left the deepest mark on Bosnian culture and history, while championing the notion that Catholics, Orthodox and Muslims are one nation, and Bosnia and Herzegovina a country with deep cultural and historical roots.Kratka povjest kralja bosanskih by Antun Kne≈æeviƒá Like Jukiƒá before him, Kne≈æeviƒá too articulately expressed his feeling of national belonging, which he always and primarily defined as Bo≈°njak (Bosniak) in such a way as to include all three religious groups inhabiting Bosnia and Herzegovina. The only other cultural identity he recognized was Illyrian, as a cultural supra- identity of all South Slavs, hence his interest and activity as a member of the Illyrian movement. He was a great opponent of any foreign occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in his time to the occupation by Turkey and by the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Fra Antun Knezeviƒá in 1877 started the construction of the Franciscan monastery in Jajce (without permission). He also opened the first public school in Bosnia in his own house.

Introduced by Jack Dongarra, they measure how fast a computer solves a dense n by n system of linear equations Ax = b, which is a common task in engineering. The latest version of these benchmarks is used to build the TOP500 list, ranking the world's most powerful supercomputers. The aim is to approximate how fast a computer will perform when solving real problems. It is a simplification, since no single computational task can reflect the overall performance of a computer system. Nevertheless, the LINPACK benchmark performance can provide a good correction over the peak performance provided by the manufacturer. The peak performance is the maximal theoretical performance a computer can achieve, calculated as the machine's frequency, in cycles per second, times the number of operations per cycle it can perform. The actual performance will always be lower than the peak performance. The performance of a computer is a complex issue that depends on many interconnected variables. The performance measured by the LINPACK benchmark consists of the number of 64-bit floating-point operations, generally additions and multiplications, a computer can perform per second, also known as FLOPS. However, a computer's performance when running actual applications is likely to be far behind the maximal performance it achieves running the appropriate LINPACK benchmark. The name of these benchmarks comes from the LINPACK package, a collection of algebra Fortran subroutines widely used in the 1980s, and initially tightly linked to the LINPACK benchmark. The LINPACK package has been since been replaced by other libraries. History The LINPACK benchmark report appeared first in 1979 as an appendix to the LINPACK user's manual. LINPACK was designed to help users estimate the time required by their systems to solve a problem using the LINPACK package, by extrapolating the performance results obtained by 23 different computers solving a matrix problem of size 100. This matrix size was chosen due to memory and CPU limitations at that time: * 10,000 floating-point entries from -1 to 1 are randomly generated to fill in a general, dense matrix, * then, LU decomposition with partial pivoting is used for the timing. Over the years, additional versions with different problem sizes, like matrices of order 300 and 1000, and constraints were released, allowing new optimization opportunities as hardware architectures started to implement matrix-vector and matrix-matrix operations. Parallel processing was also introduced in the LINPACK Parallel benchmark in the late 1980s. In 1991 the LINPACK was modified for solving problems of arbitrary size, enabling high performance computers (HPC) to get near to their asymptotic performance. Two years later this benchmark was used for measuring the performance of the first TOP500 list. The benchmarks LINPACK 100 LINPACK 100 is very similar to the original benchmark published in 1979 along with the LINPACK users' manual. The solution is obtained by Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting, with 2/3n¬≥ + 2n¬≤ floating point operations where n is 100, the order of the dense matrix A that defines the problem. Its small size and the lack of software flexibility doesn't allow most modern computers to reach their performance limits. However, it can still be useful to predict performances in numerically intensive user written code using compiler optimization. LINPACK 1000 LINPACK 1000 can provide a performance nearer to the machine's limit because in addition to offering a bigger problem size, a matrix of order 1000, changes in the algorithm are possible. The only constraints are that the relative accuracy can't be reduced and the number of operations will always be considered to be 2/3n¬≥ + 2n¬≤, with n = 1000. HPLinpack The previous benchmarks are not suitable for testing parallel computers, and the so-called Linpack's Highly Parallel Computing benchmark, or HPLinpack benchmark, was introduced. In HPLinpack the size n of the problem can be made as large as it is needed to optimize the performance results of the machine. Once again, 2/3n¬≥ + 2n¬≤ will be taken as the operation count, with independence of the algorithm used. Use of the Strassen algorithm is not allowed because it distorts the real execution rate. The accuracy must be such that the following expression is satisfied: {\\\\lVert Ax-b\\\\rVert\\\\over \\\\lVert A\\\\rVert \\\\lVert x\\\\rVert n \\\\epsilon} \\\\leq O(1), where \\\\epsilon is the machine's precision, and n is the size of the problem, \\\\lVert \\\\cdot \\\\rVert is the matrix norm and O(1) corresponds to the big-O notation. For each computer system, the following quantities are reported: * Rmax: the performance in GFLOPS for the largest problem run on a machine. * Nmax: the size of the largest problem run on a machine. * N1/2: the size where half the Rmax execution rate is achieved. * Rpeak: the theoretical peak performance GFLOPS for the machine. These results are used to compile the TOP500 list twice a year, with the world's most powerful computers. LINPACK benchmark implementations The previous section describes the ground rules for the benchmarks. The actual implementation of the program can diverge, with some examples being available in Fortran, C or Java. HPL HPL is a portable implementation of HPLinpack that was written in C, originally as a guideline, but that is now widely used to provide data for the TOP500 list, though other technologies and packages can be used. HPL generates a linear system of equations of order n and solves it using LU decomposition with partial row pivoting. It requires installed implementations of MPI and either BLAS or VSIPL to run. Coarsely, the algorithm has the following characteristics: * Cyclic data distribution in 2D blocks. * LU factorization using the right-looking variant with various depths of look- ahead. * Recursive panel factorization. * Six different panel broadcasting variants. * Bandwidth reducing swap-broadcast algorithm. * Backward substitution with look-ahead of depth 1. Criticism The LINPACK benchmark is said to have succeeded because of the scalability of HPLinpack, the fact that it generates a single number, making the results easily comparable and the extensive historical data base it has associated. However, soon after its release, the LINPACK benchmark was criticized for providing performance levels \\"generally unobtainable by all but a very few programmers who tediously optimize their code for that machine and that machine alone\\", because it only tests the resolution of dense linear systems, which are not representative of all the operations usually performed in scientific computing. Jack Dongarra, the main driving force behind the LINPACK benchmarks, said that, while they only emphasize \\"peak\\" CPU speed and number of CPUs, not enough stress is given to local bandwidth and the network. Thom Dunning, Jr., director of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, had this to say about the LINPACK benchmark: \\"The Linpack benchmark is one of those interesting phenomena -- almost anyone who knows about it will deride its utility. They understand its limitations but it has mindshare because it's the one number we've all bought into over the years.\\" According to Dongarra, \\"the organizers of the Top500 are actively looking to expand the scope of the benchmark reporting\\" because \\"it is important to include more performance characteristic and signatures for a given system\\". One of the possibilities that is being considered to extend the benchmark for the TOP500 is the HPC Challenge Benchmark Suite. With the advent of petascale computers, traversed edges per second have started to emerge as an alternative metric to FLOPS measured by LINPACK. Another alternative is the HPCG benchmark, proposed by Dongarra. The running time issue According to Jack Dongarra, the running time required to obtain good performance results with HPLinpack is expected to increase. At a conference held in 2010, he said he expects running times of 2.5 days in \\"a few years\\".

The nickname of Iron refers to the fact that, due to his involvement in numerous wars and feud, he was often wearing armour. Although he was only the third reigning Count named Henry, he is generally known as Henry VI, because there had earlier been non-ruling counts named Henry II, Henry III and Henry V.  Life  His father was Count Otto II; his mother was Matilda of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. Before coming to power in 1356, Henry made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. After his return, he had Landau Castle rebuilt. He lived there at first, however, he later moved to Waldeck Castle. He was co-ruler with his father from 1356. In 1366, he acted with great force against the city of Korbach, to punish it for disobedience. He captured the city and took hostages to Landau. After long negotiations, the city submitted to him. He later acted quite favourably towards the city, granting the citizens numerous rights and allowing them to fortify the city. In 1369, his father died and Henry VI began ruling alone. As his mother's heir, he was a candidate to inherit the Principality of L√ºneburg after the death of Duke William II, also in 1369. A delegation of the Estates of Brunswick-L√ºneburg even travelled to Waldeck to meet him. However, when they learned about his crackdown of Korbach, they returned immediately. The inheritance of L√ºneburg was left in doubt, leading to the L√ºneburg War of Succession. In 1370, Henry VI sold the possessions Bigge, R√ºdenberg and Olsberg and his share of Rappelstein Castle and some possessions around Medelon to the Lords of Gaugreben. In 1371, he created an alliance with Landgrave Henry II of Hesse to fight the robber barons of Padberg. In 1374, he joined the Westphalian Peace Alliance. During his reign, he participated in numerous feuds and other disputes. He besieged the Hessian capital Kassel twice. Henry died in 1397 of the plague. He was buried in the Waldeck chapel in Marienthal Monastery in Netze (now part of Waldeck). His sons divided the county: Adolph III started the older line of Waldeck-Landau and Henry VII started the Waldeck-Waldeck line.  Marriage and issue  On 16 December 1363, he married Elizabeth of Berg (c. 1340 - 4 October 1388). With her, he had the following children: * Adolph III * Henry VII * Margaret, married Bernard VI, Lord of Lippe * Elizabeth, married a Count of Gleichen * Irmgard, married a Count of Everstein * Matilda, abbess at Heerse Abbey * Elizabeth, abbess at Kaufungen Abbey He also had an illegitimate daughter: * Gutha von Waldeck, married Nikolaus von Wallenrodt, and had issue  References  * L.

It deals with intertwined themes of propaganda, identity, and state power in North Korea. The novel was awarded the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20140418000717 Characters *Pak Jun Do: Protagonist ‚Äì An orphan and model citizen who struggles through life in North Korea. *Commander Ga: A North Korean hero and rival of Kim Jong- il. *Sun-moon: Ga's wife and famous North Korean actress. *Kim Jong-il (the Dear Leader): North Korean dictator. *Interrogator for the North Korean state *Comrade Buc: An official in the North Korean government. He helps Commander Ga through some of his journey. *Mongnan: An old woman who befriends and helps Pak Jun Do through a challenging time in his life. Plot Part 1: The Biography of Jun Do Part 1 details Jun Do's upbringing in a state orphanage and his service to the state, including as a kidnapper of Japanese citizens, and later as a signal operator stationed on a fishing boat. Due to a 'heroic act' he displayed on the boat, he becomes part of a diplomatic delegation and travels over to America. However, as the trip to America was an unsuccessful mission, Jun Do and his team are sent to a prison mine upon returning to North Korea. Part 2: The Confessions of Commander Ga An interrogator for the North Korean state has been tasked with investigating the national hero ‚ÄúCommander Ga‚Äù who has been taken into custody for killing his wife Sun Moon, a famous North Korean actress. The interrogator compiles biographies of prisoners as a by-product of interrogation, but he realises Ga is unwilling to speak for unknown reasons. The part continues showing how Jun Do had assumed Commander Ga's identity by defeating him in a fight against him, and becoming the ‚Äúreplacement husband‚Äù of Sun Moon. At first, Sun Moon forces him to live in the dirt cellar under the house but soon accepts him into the house to live with her children and her. During his interactions with Sun Moon, Jun Do often questions her acting career and her loyalty to North Korea. After watching Casablanca, her perception of North Korea changes and both decide to make plans to defect. Meanwhile, the Dear Leader, Kim Jong-il, introduces Commander Ga to an American girl, one of the boat rowers whom Jun Do had heard about via radio when he was a signal operator. As a response to the U.S. seizing materials bound for North Korea related to nuclear development, Kim retaliated by seizing her. During her imprisonment, Kim forced her to make handwritten copies of the English translations of his collected works including his book On the Art of the Cinema. When an American delegation comes to Pyongyang to retrieve her in exchange for Kim's supplies, Jun Do puts into motion a desperate plan. When Kim Jong-il realises that Jun Do has let Sun Moon escape along with the delegation, he is arrested and later sentenced to be executed. The interrogator realises his efforts are futile when his parents point out that a propaganda version of Commander's Ga story with Sun Moon has already been broadcast. Structure and style Johnson has said that this book began as a short story called The Best North Korean Short Story of 2005. There are three narrators in the book: a third-person account; the propaganda version of Commander Ga and Sun Moon's story, which is projected across the country by loudspeakers; and a first-person account by an interrogator seeking to write a Biography of Commander Ga. Critical reception The novel's reception has been highly favorable. Michiko Kakutani, writing in The New York Times, has called it \\"a daring and remarkable novel, a novel that not only opens a frightening window on the mysterious kingdom of North Korea, but one that also excavates the very meaning of love and sacrifice.\\" Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Sam Sacks said ‚Äústylistic panache, technical daring, moral weight and an uncanny sense of the current moment‚Äîcombine in Adam Johnson's 'The Orphan Master's Son', the single best work of fiction published in 2012.‚Äù M. Francis Wolff, in her review for The New Inquiry, called the book \\"one of those rare works of high ambition that follow through on all of its promises... it examines both the Orwellian horrors of life in the DPRK and the voyeurism of Western media.\\" David Ignatius‚Äô review in the Washington Post called the novel ‚Äúan audacious act of imagination.‚ÄùWashington Post review In the New York Times, Christopher R.

Robinson and Robinson Technologies, \\"Novashell Game Creation System\\" and Pie in the Sky.Pie in the Sky Software, \\"About Pie in the Sky Software\\" Unlike more developer-oriented game engines, game creation systems promise an easy entry point for novice or hobbyist game designers, with often little to no coding required for simple behaviors. Although initially stigmatized, all-in-one game creation systems have gained some legitimacy with the central role of Unity, and GameMaker: Studio in the growth of the indie game development community.insert credit, \\"From Shooter to Shooter: The Rise of cly5m\\" Currently the Independent Games Festival recognizes games produced with similar platforms. Early game creation systems such as Broderbund's The Arcade Machine (1982), Pinball Construction Set (1983), ASCII's War Game Construction Kit (1983), Thunder Force Construction (1984), Adventure Construction Set (1984), Garry Kitchen's GameMaker (1985). Wargame Construction Set (1986), Shoot'Em-Up Construction Kit (1987), Mamirin / Dungeon Manjirou (1988), and Arcade Game Construction Kit (1988) appeared in the 1980s on home computers. 3D Construction Kit was released on the ZX Spectrum in 1991, and contained a full polygon-based world creation tool. Most of these early design frameworks are specific to one or another genre. In the 1990s, game creation systems for the IBM PC shifted both to the more general and the more specific. Whereas frameworks like RSD Game-Maker and Klik & Play attempted to accommodate any genre, communities grew around games like ZZT (later, MegaZeuxSourceForge.net, \\"MegaZeux\\") that permitted such extensive user modification that they essentially became de facto game creation systems. Pie in the Sky Software created a full on 2.5D first-person shooter creator out of an engine they previously used internally, which sold in three total versions until 2003. In the mid-2000s, with the growth of the World Wide Web and social networking, programs like BlitzBasic and Multimedia Fusion headlined an explosion of interest both in indie games and in canned game design software. Whereas earlier game creation systems tend to err on the side of user friendly interfaces,Gamasutra, \\"The Making and Unmaking of a Game- Maker Maker\\" 21st-century systems are often distinguished by extensive scripting languages that attempt to account for every possible user variable.  Features   Tools  Several game creation systems include some of the following tools: * Integrated development environment: for managing projects and resources * Command line interface: for compiling and debugging games * Sprite editor: for the editing of animated images commonly referred to as sprites * Model editor: for 3D modeling purposes * Map/Scene editor: generally used for object and tile placement  Scripting  The rise of game creation systems also saw a rise in the need for free form scripting languages with general purpose use. Some packages, such as Conitec's Gamestudio, include a more comprehensive scripting language under the surface to allow users more leeway in defining their games' behavior.

Manuel C. Herrera at PhilippineLaw.info Manuel Herrera was the second of nine children of Jose S. Herrera Sr., third municipal Mayor of Pilar (sheriff at that time) and Brigida Cruz, both natives of Wawa, Pilar, Bataan. He studied law at Manuel L. Quezon University while working as a janitor. Herrera was known for his generosity towards his fellow kababayans, his bravery, kindness, nationalism, and integrity, especially as a justice of the Court of Appeals. Despite their courageous efforts in presenting new evidences and eyewitnesses, he felt that there was really a conspiracy to assassinate not only former senator Ninoy Aquino but also the fall guy Rolando Galman. On January 10, 1985, he and his prosecution team together by presiding Justice Manuel Pamaram were called by President Marcos to a meeting in Malaca√±an Palace, insinuating that Galman was really the communist who shot Aquino and defended the accused. Herrera tried to voice out his opinion by telling that Galman was a fall guy and there was an ongoing conspiracy but Pamaran told him not to contradict Marcos because he was sick at that time and the President might collapse. But it only swelled the flood of dissatisfaction of his regime, less than a year the EDSA People Power Revolution occurred and Marcos found himself out in power. In March 1986 he revealed that Marcos did in fact try to influence, if not direct, the outcome of the first Sandiganbayan. Herrera then became one of the Associate justices of the Court of Appeals until his retirement. Herrera died of a heart attack at the age of 74. A road (Justice Manuel C. Herrera Road) was named after him in honor of his great contributions to the people and love of his fellows kabarangays. References External links *A.M.

Biography Pyotr Shchebalsky was born in 1810 into a noble Pskovian family. In 1829 he joined the Artillery college, in 1830 became a junker and after the graduation in 1834 remained at the college in the rank of praporshchik to receive the extended course of studies. In 1836-1842 he served in the Guards artillery, then on July 17, 1842, for taking part in a duel was lowered in rank to a cannoneer and got transferred to the field artillery unit of the Caucasian grenadiers' brigade. Schebalsky took part in several major operations in Chechnya and Dagestan and was rewarded the soldier's Order of St. George. After six years of the service in the Caucasus he was reinstated in ranks and in January 1848 was returned to the Guards to join in December of the same year the Emperor's battery of His Majesty Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich. At the same time he took the posts of the head of the Division's school of artillery and the special class of Don's uryadniks' tutor. In 1954 for financial reasons Shchebalsky retired from the military service and was appointed the chief of Moscow police. In 1858, now the Ministry of Education official, Shchebalsky started his career as a critic and literary historian. As the Ministry's special envoy, in the course of 4 years he was compiling the comprehensive Russian press reviews for the Tsar. At the same time, by the then Minister of Education's request, he wrote his major treatise, The History of Censorship in Russia. In those four years time Shchebalsky also wrote the series of essays that were published under the title Readings from the Russian History from the XVII Century Onwards. All the while his works on the history of Russian literature were being published in Zarya, Russky Arkhiv, but mostly in The Russian Messenger which he's been an active contributor to. The last 15 years of his life Shchebalsky spent in Poland, first as a head of educational directories - first of Suwa≈Çki (from 1871), then of Warsaw (from 1875). After retirement he became the editor of Varshavsky Dnevnik (The Warsaw Diary), the only Russian newspaper in Poland which during years of his leadership became a prominent publication, both allies and opponents praising Shchebalsky's objectivity and literary talent. Pyotr Shchebalsky died in Warsaw on March 20, 1886.
