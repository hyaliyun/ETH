Abdullah Beg Benari was a Kurdish tribal leader, who lived from 1880 to 1939. He was the son of Sheikh Jahangir, who was the son of Sultan Beg, and a descendant of Bradostian Kurdish princes who fought in the battle of Dimdim Castle against the Iranian invasion by the Shah Abbas in 1609. Abdullah lived in the castle of Binar, which witnessed several battles between the local princes of Bradost and the Iranian-Afshar army. The last battle was fought between Mir Sultan Bradost and Amir Askar Afshar Urmia in 1841. Kurdish folklore is full of oral stories about Aola Begi Benare and his battles against the Persians and Russians. Abdullah settled in Shaitanawa south of Urmia. The Shah of Qajar captured him, took him to Zanjan, and sentenced him to death for his support of Simko Shikak's revolution in Urmia, but Abdullah was freed after the efforts exerted by the relatives of his Afsharian wife.

All her work is related to network theory with the Internet at its core. It‚Äôs the interactions and co-creation processes within her network she cherishes most. She loves to see things emerging and falling into place. Biography Born in 1960, Reinhard studied business administration at the University of Mannheim. After graduating, she spent over 10 years investigating new media developments in Italy and the United States. Back in Germany, in 1994 she organized a conference on interactive television, accompanied by her publication Interaktives Fernshen: Kontaktadressen. Projects She co-founded DNAdigital, a 2008-2010 initiative in Germany that aimed to foster dialogue between the 'Internet Generation' and business leaders regarding the world of work. She published and contributed to Reboot_D - Digital Democracy, a 2009 compilation of articles and interviews about the way the internet is shaping and transforming society and politics in Germany. In 2008 Reinhard set up a project called WeBenin, aiming to help people in one of the poorest countries in West Africa to empower themselves, avoiding the paradigm of rich NGOs giving goods to poor aid recipients. She founded a skatepark in Janwaar in Madhya Pradesh, called Janwaar Castle, where one of the main rules to use the rink is \\"no school, no skateboarding,\\" and which encourages girls to use the rink. The rink has had a positive effect in helping to encourage girls to be involved in physical activities and has reduced violence between the Adivasi and Yadev castes in the area. Now children from both castes make friends. Young people in the village also learn English, how to paint, create 3D models, learn life skills, music and dance. In 2016, one of the girls from the village who Reinhard was tutoring in English, was selected to attend school in the United Kingdom. The skatepark is 4,843 square feed and was opened in April 2015.

It was recorded in three different locations by multiple engineers: the title track was recorded at the Fortress Studios, London with producer Gareth Parton; \\"The Last Time\\", which features lead vocals by Mark Lanegan, and \\"Pinnacle Hollow\\" were recorded by Ben Mumphrey in Dayton, OH; \\"Chances Are\\", a cover of a Bob Marley song, was recorded by Steve Albini at Electrical Audio in Chicago. Development and recording The Breeders released their fourth studio album, Mountain Battles, in the spring of 2008, and the Deals continued writing new songs. Near the end of their 2008 tour, they were in the United Kingdom, and decided to record the new composition \\"Fate to Fatal\\" at Fortress Studios in London. The song took about two days to record and mix, including time spent moving their musical equipment into the studio and setting up. The engineer was Gareth Parton, with assistants Tom Morris and Nick Trepka. Later, the Breeders found out that they would be curating the All Tomorrow's Parties music festival‚Äîheld on May 15, 2009 in Minehead, United Kingdom. They had been playing their Mountain Battles material for several months, and decided that it would be nice to have new songs to perform. Their first thought was to put out one or two songs on a single, but subsequently decided to release an EP instead. They had three original compositions that they wanted to release, but felt that this would be too short for an EP, so they decided to also do a cover of Bob Marley's \\"Chances Are\\". They recorded this at Electrical Audio in Chicago, with engineer Steve Albini and assistants Dominique D'Amico and Gregoire Yeche. The Breeders recorded \\"Pinnacle Hollow\\" and \\"The Last Time\\" in Kim Deal's basement, at her home in Dayton, Ohio, with engineer Ben Mumphrey. Kim and Kelley recorded the latter track in January 2009; Breeders Mondo Lopez and Jose Medeles were not present. They then sent the track to Mark Lanegan, who recorded his vocals elsewhere, and sent it back to them. The assistant engineer for \\"Pinnacle Hollow\\" was James Hutchinson. Songs Reviewers have characterized \\"Fate to Fatal\\" as \\"ramshackle\\", \\"jarring and ... exuberant\\". The music and singing alternates between loud and quiet, reminiscent of the dynamic that Kim's former group, Pixies, is known for. Kim notes that the song's title refers to the line \\"What men pray for, what men cradle/I've gone from fate to fatal\\"; she describes the song as about a lonesome person who does not know how to connect with other people. Kim Deal has stated that \\"The Last Time\\" is about \\"moments where ... [one feels] gutted, taken down in life\\". When she wrote the song, she imagined it being sung by a man. She recorded a version with her singing it herself, but felt that she did not convey enough pain in her performance. While discussing Mark Lanegan's work with a friend, she decided to ask him to sing on the track, and he agreed. Lanegan's vocals have been compared to Lou Reed's, and described as \\"weary\\" and as a \\"pallbearer growl\\". Kim and Kelley Deal had been listening to, and considering recording a cover of, \\"Chances Are\\" for about ten years. They had experimented with adding instruments such as drums and stand-up bass, but their version on Fate to Fatal is a more minimalist, acoustic rendition. In interviews, the Deals have noted that while Bob Marley is associated with reggae, \\"Chances Are\\" comes from his earlier, doo-wop period. \\"Pinnacle Hollow\\", in which Kim hears a Neil Young influence, has been described as having a \\"bluesy\\" and a \\"slightly spooky\\" sound. There are approximately two and a half minutes of instrumentation before the vocals start. Kim and Kelley sing‚Äîin a manner that has been characterized as \\"deadpan\\"‚Äîlines such as \\"I don't know a sin I haven't found\\" and \\"up and down the road....\\" Kim was originally going to call the composition \\"Up and Down\\" but later decided on \\"Pinnacle Hollow\\", named after Pinnacle Holler, a place where the Deals' mother grew up in West Virginia. Cover The EP's cover was designed by Chris Glass. Not long before this, Glass had designed the logo for U.S. president Barack Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Fate to Fatal design was Glass's first work doing a record cover. Glass, who is related to the Deals through marriage, had been a fan of the Breeders' music and of the work of Vaughan Oliver, who had designed most of the group's covers for 4AD. Release and reception All of the Breeders' previous albums and EPs had been released on the record label 4AD: up until 2002's Title TK Kim Deal was under contract with that label, and the Breeders released 2008's Mountain Battles with 4AD as a \\"one-off\\". For Fate to Fatal, they considered whether it was worthwhile to negotiate again with 4AD to release it as well. They conferred with friends in the music industry, including Albini, Bob Weston, and former 4AD owner Ivo Watts-Russell, and decided to release the EP themselves independently, on Period Music. On April 21, 2009, they released 1000 copies on vinyl for Record Store Day; they also made the EP available digitally. Video The Breeders made a music video for the song \\"Fate to Fatal\\", co-directed by Lopez and James Ford. They shot the video at the St. Louis Skatium, a roller rink in St. Louis, where they filmed the Arch Rival Rollergirls women's roller derby team. The idea for this setting came when by chance Kelley met groups of roller derby athletes in the summer and autumn of 2008: first, an Arch Rival member named Amy Whited that the Deals had known since her childhood; next, a roller derby team at a Barack Obama benefit in Cincinnati; then, a different team at a craft competition in Minnesota. The \\"Fate to Fatal\\" video also includes footage of the Breeders in studio.

Effectively members of this branch are soldiers of the navy. Originally limited for base and harbour security, in recent years Naval Patrolmen have taken part in offensive and defensive operations against the LTTE in conjunction with the Sri Lanka Army or independently, using both infantry and light armored units.https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/sri-lanka/navy- amphibious.htm It has also taken part in amphibious operations. History Naval personal have been deployed on shore patrol duties on many occasions since the formation of the Royal Ceylon Navy in 1950. Regularly naval personal were deployed to support the police to control civil disobedience along with the Army during many harthals and riots during the 1950s and 1960s. During the 1962 coup d'√©tat attempt the internal security personnel of the navy were detailed to guard Prime Minister's House (Temple Trees). In 1971 navy personal were deployed in various parts of the island to suppress communist insurgents during the 1971 JVP Insurrection. Since the 1970s up until the late 1980s the navy personal guarded the Broadcasting Corporation station in Colombo. With the escalation of the Sri Lankan Civil War and increased threat to naval bases that were launching pads for naval operations to curb LTTE sea movements, the Vice Admiral Ananda Silva, the Commander of the Navy instituted the formation of the Naval Patrolmen Branch in 1987 to carry out operations on land. This unit was formed primary as a protective force for base and port security, but increased its numbers and scope for amphibious and land combat operations. To achieve its objectives the patrolmen are equipped with light arms and have mortars, Unibuffel light armored vehicles. Naval Patrolmen have taken part in several major combat operations alongside Army units, these include Operation Sea Breeze, Operation Balavegaya, Operation Riviresa and Operation Jayasikurui having raised to the strength of 3 battalions by 1997. Its personnel fought till the bitter end during the Battle of Pooneryn. During the last part of the civil war known as the Eelam War IV Naval Patrolmen garrisoned and defended the government controlled islands around the Jaffna Peninsula such as Delft Island and Kayts. Since 1987, the Naval Patrolmen frequently mounts guard at the Presidents House, and carry out other ceremonial duties. Marine battalion In 2016, the Sri Lanka Navy formed its first battalion of Marines consisting of 6 officers and 158 sailors from the Naval Patrolmen branch, specializing in amphibious warfare. The unit started training under the assistance of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit of the United States Marine Corps in November 2016 Sri Lankan Marines in an amphibious capabilities demonstration during the Sri Lanka Marine Corps Boot Camp graduation at Sri Lankan Naval Station Barana in Mullikulum, Sri Lanka, Feb. 27, 2017. Organisation and current role Officers and patrolmen are organized into battalions based at naval bases island wide and independent detachments. All units come under the command of Director Naval Land Operations, who in turn reports to Director General (Operations), however individual units come under that command of the Naval Area Command that they belong too. At first the primary role was harbor and base security, but increased its numbers and scope for amphibious and land combat operations. In recent years with expansion of the number of battalions, patrolmen have begun supporting the Sri Lanka Army in manning defence lines in the north central part of the country and taking part in offensive operations jointly or independently. This led to the formation of the North Central Command (which covers a landlocked area). The security of the Colombo harbor, along with all other harbors in the country is handled by the navy, as the Sri Lanka Navy is the Designated Authority for implementing International Ships and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code in Sri Lanka. To achieve its objectives, patrolmen are equipped with light arms and have mortars and light armoured vehicles. The unit's Training Centre is located at SLNS Pandukabaya.

The main church of Saint Grigor, was built in 903 by Prince Shapuh Bagratuni and his sister Mariam, siblings of King Smbat I. The church located on the southern end may have been built around the same time, while the gavit between the two was added at a later point in time. Saint Grigor was renovated and restored by King Gagik I of the Bagratid dynasty in the late 10th century. During this restoration a surrounding wall was built. King Smbat I of Armenia was buried in Vanevan Monastery in 914.  Architecture  The church has four central arches that widen progressively. An addition of a corner course between the arch bands allows this to occur. Vanevan and Tatev are the earliest such examples of this. Saint Grigor's drum is octagonal from the interior and exterior with an inscription on the latter that dates the church. The drums of both churches have an identical decorative molded band, leading to the belief that they were contemporaneous with one another. Only the dome on the main church has survived, while the drum and dome of the other have since collapsed. Behind the monastery is a spring and cave which leads out to the top of the ravine. It is said that it was once used as an escape route from Turkish invaders. Headed east up the side of the ravine behind the monastery not too far away is a large but now broken khachkar monument. Also in the vicinity just south of Artsvanist is an early cemetery and remains of a church. Approximately three kilometers south of this is Kolataki Saint Astvatsatsin Church from the late 9th - early 10th century and Hnevank from the 10th century. Nearby is also the cyclopean fortress Bruti Berd.  Gallery  Image: Vanevan Monastery Front.JPG|Front view of the monastery. Image:Vanevan Drum Inscriptions.JPG|Inscriptions upon the drum.

It should not to be confused with the Cathedral of Santa Catarina, also in Old Goa. The indigenous population of the erstwhile Portuguese colony of Goa underwent a large-scale conversion from Hinduism to Christianity after its conquest and occupation by the Portuguese Empire, led by admiral Afonso de Albuquerque in 1510. After conversion to Roman Catholicism, they were granted Portuguese citizenship. Almost all the present-day Goan Catholics are descendants of these local converts to the religion. They constitute the largest Christian community in Goa and account for 25 per cent of the total Catholic population in India. The Mangalorean Catholic and Karwari Catholic communities of the Indian state of Karnataka are also largely descended from these Goan converts. East Indian Catholics of northern Konkan districts and Christians of Damaon also have some Portuguese Goan ancestry and interaction, East Indians were formerly Portuguese overseas citizens until when Bombay was handed over as a royal dowry to the British East India Company by the Portuguese Viceroyalty. Conversion to Christianity During the mid-16th century, the Portuguese colony of Goa, especially the city of Goa, was the center of Christianization in the East. Christianization in Goa was largely limited to the four concelhos (districts) of Bardez, Mormugao, Salcette, and Tiswadi. Furthermore, evangelisation activities were divided in 1555 by the Portuguese viceroy of Goa, Pedro Mascarenhas. He allotted Bardez to the Franciscans, Tiswadi to the Dominicans, and Salcette, together with fifteen southeastern villages of Tiswadi, including Chor√£o and Divar, to the Jesuits. The city of Old Goa was shared among all, since all the religious orders had their headquarters there. Prior to that, the Franciscans alone Christianized Goa till 1542. Other less active orders that maintained a presence in Goa were the Augustines, Carmelites, and Theatines. The first mass conversions took place among the Brahmins of Divar, and the Kshatriyas of Carambolim. In Bardez, Mangappa Shenoy of Pilerne was the first Hindu to convert to Christianity in 1555, adopting the name Pero Ribeiro and thus becoming the first Christian of Bardez. His conversion was followed by that of his brother Panduranga and his uncle Balkrishna Shenoy, who is the direct patrilineal ancestor of Goan historian Jos√© Gerson da Cunha. In Salcette, Raia was the first village to have been Christianised, when its populace was converted en masse to Christianity in 1560. In 1534, Goa was made a diocese and in 1557 an archdiocese. The Archbishop of Goa was the most important ecclesiastic of the East, and was from 1572 called the \\"Primate of the East\\". While the Portuguese rulers implemented state policies encouraging and even rewarding conversions among Hindu subjects, it would be false to ascribe the large number of conversions solely to force. On the contrary, the rapid rise of converts in Goa was mostly the result of Portuguese economic and political control over the Hindus, who were vassals of the Portuguese crown. Name changes This process of Christianization was simultaneously accompanied by Lusitanisation, as the Christian converts typically assumed a Portuguese veneer. The most visible aspect was the discarding of old Hindu names for new Christian Portuguese names. The 1567 Provincial Council of Goa‚Äîunder the presidency of the first Archbishop of Goa Gaspar Jorge de Le√£o Pereira and after his retirement under that of George Themudo, Bishop of Cochin‚Äîpassed over 115 decrees. One of them declared that the Goan Catholics would henceforth not be permitted to use their former Hindu names. Consequently, the converts typically had to adopt the surnames of the Portuguese priest, governor, soldier or layman who stood as godfather for their baptism ceremony. For instance, the Boletim do Instituto Vasco da Gama lists the new names of some of the prominent ganvkars (Konkani: Freeholders). Rama Prabhu, son of Dado Vithal Prabhu from Benaulim, Salcette, became Francisco Fernandes; Mahabal Pai, son of Nara Pai, became Manuel Fernandes in 1596. Mahabal Kamati of Curtorim became Aleisco Menezes in 1607, while Chandrappa Naik of Gandaulim became Ant√≥nio Dias in 1632. In 1595 Vittu Prabhu became Irm√£o de diago Soares and the son of Raulu Kamat became Manuel Pinto in Aldona, Bardez. Ram Kamat of Punola became Duarte Lobo in 1601, while Tados Irmaose of Anjuna became Jo√£o de Souza in 1658. Since in many cases, fathers and sons were not necessarily baptised in the presence of the same godfather, this would lead to them having different surnames. For instance in 1594, the son of Pero Parras, a ganvkar from Raia acquired at baptism the new name of Sebasti√£o Barbosa. Later in 1609, another of his sons converted and took the name of Jo√£o Rangel. As a result, members of the same vangodd (clan) who initially all shared a common Hindu surname ended up adopting divergent Lusitanian ones. \\"Um fen√≥meno curioso aconteceu neste processo de convers√£o: por vezes, irm√£os e pais convertidos, ou em momentos diferentes, ou por terem padrinhos diferentes, acabaram por adoptar apelidos diferentes. A t√≠tulo de exemplo, encontra-se numa escritura de 1594, como gancar da aldeia da Raia, Sebasti√£o Barbosa, filho de Pero Parras; e num outro documento, de 1609, Jo√£o Rangel, tamb√©m gancar, filho do mesmo Pero Parras. Dois irm√£os, um Rangel e um Barbosa, ambos filhos de um Parras.\\" (\\"A curious thing happened in this process of conversion: sometimes siblings and parents converted, or at different times, or having different sponsors, and ended up adopting different last names. For example, there is a deed of 1594, when a ganvkar (villager) of Raia, Sebasti√£o Barbosa, shows up as the son of Pero Parras. In another document, in 1609, Jo√£o Rangel, also a ganvkar (villager), turns out to be the son of the same Pero Parras. Two brothers, one a Rangel and one a Barbosa, both sons of a Parras!\\") Impact of Christianity on the caste system However, the converted Hindus retained their mother tongue (which in most cases was Konkani) and caste status, even after becoming Christian. Based on their previous caste affiliations, the new converts were usually lumped into new Catholic castes. The converts from the priestly Brahmin class were Bamonns (Konkani: Brahmins). All Brahmin subcastes such as the Goud Saraswat Brahmins, Padyes, the Daivadnyas, and especially the goldsmiths and a few merchants, were lumped into the Christian caste of Bamonn. The converts from the Kshatriya and Vaishya Vani castes became Chardos (Kshatriyas); and those Vaishya who couldn't become Chardos formed a new caste Gauddos. Those converts from lower castes were grouped together as Sudirs, equivalent to Shudras. The Bamonns, Chardos, and Gauddos have been traditionally seen as the high castes in the Goan Catholic caste hierarchy. Persistence of the caste system Holy Cross), of a Goan Catholic family, constructed using olden-style Portuguese architecture Bound by their rigid caste rules, these local converts (particularly the Brahmins) retained pride of caste and race, and very seldom inter-married with the Portuguese. The Portuguese initially attempted to abolish caste distinctions among the local converts and homogenise them into a single entity, but soon found this to be an impossible task and were consequently forced to recognise them. Caste consciousness among the native Christians was so intense that they even maintained separate Church confraternities dedicated to the perpetuation of the existing caste hierarchy. In church circles, the Bamonns and Chardos were rivals and frequently discriminated against each other. Caste discrimination even extended to the clergy. For instance, while there is evidence of Chardo priests since the late 17th century, only Bamonns, Mesti√ßos and foreigners were allowed to join the priesthood till then, and even from that period onwards, members of the clergy continued to hail overwhelmingly from the Bamonn caste. However, some non- Bamonn priests did achieve distinction. For instance, it was Fr. Estev√£o Jeremais Mascarenhas, a Gauddo by caste and member of parliament elected several times by public demand; who spoke of self-determination in 1853. The Portuguese church authorities decided to recruit Gauddos and Sudirs into the priesthood, to offset the increasing hostilities of the Bamonn and Chardo clerics. At least three Sudir priests trained by the Jesuits are known to have been condemned by the Inquisition in 1736. The church authorities initially used the Bamonns and following the example of St. Francis Xavier, Chardos as Konkani and Marathi interpreters in their parishes and missions. Theories for the persistence of the caste system Historian A.B. Bragan√ßa Pereira attributes the continued maintenance of the caste system to the mass conversion of entire villages, which led to the religious complexion of the whole village being Christianized without affecting the existing caste structure. He posits that had the conversions taken place in individual instances, the converts would have formed into a homogenous community and the caste system would have disappeared among the Christians due to their inability to find marriage partners from the same caste. According to historian Jos√© Gerson da Cunha: > \\"The spread of Christianity in the Southern Konkan was not a caste levelling > process. It simply conciliated old prejudices with new privileges. A > converted Brahman became a Christian in faith alone, retaining all the > social rights of Hinduism, and transmitting all caste prerogatives, > untainted by any admixture of foreign or low caste blood, through > generations to his current aristocratic posterity.\\" To this, historian C. R. Boxer adds: > \\"Nothing is more erroneous than the common perception that all Goans have a > considerable dose of Portuguese blood in their veins. The great majority are > ethnically Indians, though their centuries-old adoption of the Roman > Catholic religion, and of the Portuguese language and mores, together with > their assumption of Portuguese names, have firmly ingrained them in the > Portuguese cultural orbit.\\" Discrimination against native Christians While the Portuguese intermarried with some locals and spawned a Mesti√ßo class in Goa, they desired complete acculturation of the native Christians into Portuguese culture. The retention of the caste system and Hindu customs by the converts was contemptuously looked down upon by the Portuguese, who desired complete assimilation of the native Christians into their own culture. Consequently, they considered the native Christians to be inferior and practised social discrimination against them. The social attitudes of the Portuguese towards the native Christians is exemplified in a memorandum submitted by the Christians of Salcette to the Portuguese monarch Jo√£o IV in 1642: > \\"It is very painful to realise that when our people were Hindus, they were > better honoured and respected in the courts of Hindu and Muslim rulers, but > after conversion we have lost much of our self-respect. A Portuguese > nobleman or Minister shows greater respect to a low caste Hindu than to a > Christian of high caste. It happens quite often that a Hindu is given a > chair to sit and a native Christian stands. This attitude of the Portuguese > had moved many Christians in the recent years to go to the city with the > headgears and the tunic of the kind the Hindus wear. There is no way of > talking to Hindus about conversion any more, because they reply that they > are not in a hurry to lose their self-respect.\\" The Portuguese clergy generally bore racial prejudices against their Goan counterparts. In their letters, they made frequent references to the fact that the native clergy were dark skinned, and that the parishioners had no respect for them as a result. The Franciscan parish priest of Colvale Church, Frei Ant√≥nio de Encarna√ß√£o, excommunicated for striking a Goan assistant, wrote a bitter and virulent essay against the native clergy wherein he called them ' negros chamados curas ' () and termed them as 'perverse' and 'insolent'. The Jesuits‚Äîwith some exceptions, and Franciscans did not bother to learn the native language Konkani. The Franciscans further expanded on the viceregal decree of 1606 regarding making the natives illiterate in Konkani, and literate or semi-literate in Portuguese to qualify for receiving sacraments. The Archbishop of Goa Ignacio de Santa Theresa is known to have respected the native Goan clerics more than the Portuguese ones, whom he considered to be insolent and overbearing. Relations between the Portuguese and their Hindu subjects Goa at its height under Portuguese occupation. The Velhas Conquistas () are highlighted in red, while the Novas Conquistas (Portuguese: New Conquests) are highlighted in cream. The Portuguese aimed to create a native citizenry loyal to their Empire, which they believed they could accomplish through mass conversions to Roman Catholicism. However, the converts largely turned out to be a useless citizenry as far as skills, trade, and ownership of capital were concerned.Brief Encounters: Touching on a touchy topic, Frederick Noronha, Goanet, 5 July 2002 Instead, the Portuguese relied on the Hindus (who were not considered full citizens of their Empire) to fulfill their personal and official ambitions, as they were seen to possess the capital, skills, contacts, and shrewdness required to sustain the Empire and its ambitions. The Portuguese and Hindus were great business and military collaborators; religious affiliations did not matter. Therefore, many Hindus who did not convert or even those who consistently refused to convert and overtly opposed Christendom continued to receive from the Portuguese more honours, favours and jobs than the Christians. This was done with the view of gaining their collaboration, not necessarily their conversion, although conversion was encouraged. For instance, the duty of collecting taxes on the cultivation of tobacco in Goa was entrusted to the Hindu tax farmers, who were usually cruel to the native Christians while exercising their powers. With the support of the Portuguese government, they became the most feared and influential native class in the province. The tax farmers would unjustly levy fines on native Christians for the illegal cultivation of tobacco. They would ill treat the native womenfolk at the tollbooth on the pretext of searching for illegal goods. As a result, entire Christian village communities were deprived of considerable surplus income and many poor Christians were made into vagabonds or forced to flee Goa to the neighbouring kingdoms. The Portuguese colonial and church authorities did not employ politico-economic potentialities to achieve equality by raising the standard of living of the native Christians. The Jesuit report of 1686 stated thus: \\"They are very poor and surviving on the income of labour which brings in just enough for their sustenance.\\" In 1780, the Portuguese conquered from the Marathas the concelhos of Pernem, Sanquelim and Sattari. After a treaty signed on 29 January 1788 with the rajah of Sonda, they acquired the concelhos of Bicholim, Antruz, Sanguem, Quepem and Canacona. The influence of the clergy had significantly decreased by this time. The Jesuit order had been banned in 1759 and the political clout of the other religious orders had also considerably diminished. The Portuguese zeal for Christianization gradually died down, so much so that by the last quarter of the 18th century, with the acquisition of the Novas Conquistas, they officially permitted the construction of temples in the territory and agreed not to interfere in the existing religious and social customs. Furthermore, no conversion work was undertaken there. By then, the situation had also greatly improved for the Hindus and Christians in the Velhas Conquistas, with no more anti-Hindu decrees being passed. After 1835, many Hindu families from the Novas Conquistas were permitted by the authorities to settle in the Velhas Conquistas and some Christian families were in turn encouraged to take the reverse route with the lure of land for a small annual rent. Conversion of Catholic Gaudas In the late 1920s, prominent members of Goan Hindu society requested Vinayak Maharaj Masurkar, the prelate of a Vaishnava ashram in Masur, Satara district; to actively campaign for the 're-conversion' of Catholic Gaudas to Hinduism. Masurkar accepted, and together with his disciples, subsequently toured Gauda villages singing devotional bhakti songs and performing pujas. These means led a considerable number of Catholic Gaudas to declare willingness to come into the Hindu fold, and a Shuddhi ceremony was carefully prepared. Their efforts was met with success when on 23 February 1928, many Catholic Gaudas were converted en masse to Hinduism in a Shuddhi ceremony, notwithstanding the vehement opposition of the Roman Catholic Church and the Portuguese authorities. As part of their new religious identity, the converts were given Hindu names. However, the Portuguese government refused to grant them legal permission to change their names. Around 4,851 Catholic Gaudas from Tiswadi, 2,174 from Ponda, 250 from Bicholim and 329 from Sattari became Hindus in this ceremony. The total number of Gauda converts was 7,815. The wider Hindu Gauda community refused to accept these neo-Hindus back into their fold, and they were now alienated by their former Christian coreligionists. These neo-Hindus developed into a separate endogamous community, and are now referred to as Nav-Hindu Gaudas (New Hindu Gaudas). Decline of Christianity Since 1851, the Christian population of Goa has been facing a continual decline. Consequentially, the percentage of the Christian population (once a majority) has been demographically shifting in favor of the Hindus. As per the data available, Christians constituted 63.83% (232,189 individuals), whereas Hindus comprised just 35.42% (128,824 individuals) in the 1851 census. The next census was carried out in 1881, according to which Christians were 58%, while Hindus were 42% of the population. The percentage of the Christian population went on declining in the subsequent censuses for the years 1900, 1910, 1921, 1931, 1950, and 1960, with the percentage of Christians in the censuses being 54.83 per cent, 54.76 per cent, 52.29 per cent, 49.00 per cent, 42.18 per cent, and 38.07 per cent. The reason for this was the out-migration of Christians and the probable return of the descendants of Hindu migrants who had fled Goa as well as mass immigration of non ethnic Goans into Goa. In 1998, Goa's population was estimated to be just over 1.3 million persons, of which 62% (806,000 individuals) were Hindu and 34% (442,000 individuals) were Christians. In 2011, 66% (963,877 individuals) were Hindu and 25% (366,130 individuals) were Christians.

The continuing conflict between the two countries over the region of Nagorno- Karabakh, which is considered to be a de jure part of Azerbaijan by the United Nations, but has been under control of the Armenia-backed de facto Nagorno- Karabakh Republic since 1993, has affected the Eurovision Song Contest on several occasions. Conflicts between Armenia and Azerbaijan first appeared in 2006, when Azerbaijani media criticized the event's website for listing Nagorno-Karabakh as the birthplace of Armenia's first representative, Andr√©, as it was part of the Azerbaijan SSR at the time. Conflicts notably escalated throughout the 2009 contest: during the semi-finals, Azerbaijani officials objected to the depiction of the Nagorno-Karabakh monument We Are Our Mountains during an introductory video for the Armenian entry. Armenia responded during the finals by displaying multiple images of the monument whilst presenting its results. Following the contest, allegations emerged that Azerbaijan's state broadcaster had tampered with its feed of the broadcast to censor the Armenian entry, and that the Azerbaijani government was interrogating citizens who voted for Armenia, accusing them of being unpatriotic and a threat to security. Following an inquiry, Azerbaijan was fined by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) for breaching the privacy of voters. Following the 2010 Junior Eurovision Song Contest, Armenian media claimed that Azerbaijan's broadcaster had cut off the broadcast when it became apparent that Armenia had won; however, it was disputed whether the contest was even broadcast in Azerbaijan as they had not yet participated. Accordingly, as Azerbaijan prepared to host the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest following its victory in 2011, a group of Armenian musicians led a boycott effort, and the country would ultimately withdraw from the contest, causing the broadcaster to be fined for the late notice. Armenia returned in the 2013 edition, which was held in Sweden. The move was criticized by an Azerbaijani politician and a representative of the country's state broadcaster, who felt that Armenia's participation could have been a symbol of peace between the two nations, and that the decision would further damage the country's reputation. Conflicts between the two countries began to develop again during the lead-up to the 2015 contest, where allegations emerged that the Armenian entry, \\"Don't Deny\\", was a call for recognition of the Armenian Genocide (whose 100th anniversary was commemorated prior to the 2015 contest). As Azerbaijan denies the genocide, officials from the country issued a statement threatening Armenia for attempting to use Eurovision as an outlet for its \\"political ambitions\\". The song was subsequently renamed \\"Face the Shadow\\" to address concerns over its alleged political themes. The following year, Armenian representative Iveta Mukuchyan was reprimanded by organizers for displaying the flag of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic during the first semi-final. Initial appearances In 2006‚Äîthe first year in which Armenia participated, the official Eurovision website listed the birthplace of its performer Andr√© as being in the \\"Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh\\". Media outlets in Azerbaijan criticized the contest's organizers for recognizing the republic, especially given that the region was an autonomous oblast within the Azerbaijan SSR when Andr√© was born in 1979. The birthplace listing on Andr√©'s profile was later removed entirely. Azerbaijan would make its own Eurovision debut in 2008‚Äîmarking the first time both Armenia and Azerbaijan competed against each other at the contest. The Armenian entry, \\"Q√©l√©, Q√©l√©\\" by Sirusho, finished in 4th place, while Azerbaijan's inaugural entry, \\"Day After Day\\", finished 8th. 2009 contest Postcard controversy and aftermath In protest of complaints by Azerbaijan over its usage during the semi-finals, Armenia displayed multiple images of We Are Our Mountains while presenting its votes at the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest finals. During the first semi-final of the 2009 contest, the \\"postcard\\" video introducing the performance of the Armenian entry \\"Jan Jan\\" depicted, amongst other monuments, We Are Our Mountains, an art piece located in Nagorno-Karabakh's capital city of Stepanakert. Due to the country's claims over the region, Azerbaijani officials objected to the portrayal of We Are Our Mountains as being an Armenian landmark. For the finals telecast, the video was edited to remove the statue. In protest of the decision, multiple photographs of We Are Our Mountains were displayed during the presentation of voting results from Armenia; one was displayed on a video screen at Yerevan's Republic Square in the background, and another was displayed on the back of a clipboard that the Armenian voting presenter Sirusho was reading results from. Despite the controversy, 1,065 Armenians voted for the Azerbaijani entry, enough to give the country a single point. A total of 43 Azerbaijanis voted for the Armenian entry. Censorship, interrogation of voters Following the contest, reports surfaced that the local Azerbaijani broadcaster, ƒ∞ctimai Television, had attempted to censor the Armenian performance from its broadcast of the final, and had obscured the voting number for the entry in an effort to discourage voting for it. ƒ∞TV denied these claims, and provided footage showing that its broadcast was untampered with. In August 2009, a number of Azerbaijanis who had voted for Armenia's entry during the contest were summoned for questioning at the Ministry of National Security in Baku, during which they were accused of being \\"unpatriotic\\" and \\"a potential security threat\\". One of those summoned, Rovshan Nasirli (who had voted for \\"Jan Jan\\" because he felt it was a better reflection of Azerbaijani music than \\"Always\\", the country's actual entry) said that his interrogators told him that they had the names and addresses of all 43 Azerbaijanis who had voted for Armenia. Following these reports, Svante Stockselius, executive supervisor of the Eurovision Song Contest, announced the launch of an enquiry into the incidents. In their response, ƒ∞ctimai TV stated that while two individuals had been invited to the Ministry of National Security, the Ministry had given assurances that nobody had been questioned, either officially or unofficially, on voting in the competition itself. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) Director General, Jean R√©veillon, responded to this by saying that freedom to vote is one of the cornerstones of the contest and \\"Any breach of privacy regarding voting, or interrogation of individuals, is totally unacceptable\\". Azerbaijani Minister of Youth and Sport, Azad Rahimov, denied that anyone had been summoned to the Ministry of National Security about voting for the Armenian entry, and accused RFE/RL and other news outlets of reporting the allegations to create a scandal. The Reference Group of the EBU, which organizes Eurovision, examined the matter at a meeting in Oslo on 11 September 2009. In a statement issued on 17 September, the EBU acknowledged the allegations that Azerbaijani officials were interrogating voters and breaching their privacy. While the EBU would not impose sanctions on or ban Azerbaijan from future editions of the contest (the country could have been banned from the contest for three years), it fined the delegation ‚Ç¨2,700, and changed its rules to make participating broadcasters liable for the \\"disclosure of information which could be used to identify voters\\" during future editions of the contest. Previously, telecommunications providers were liable, but the EBU could not impose sanctions on them. 2010 Junior Eurovision Song Contest Vladimir Arzumanyan, a singer from Nagorno- Karabakh representing Armenia, won the 2010 Junior Eurovision Song Contest. It was alleged by Armenian media outlets that the broadcast of the contest in Azerbaijan was interrupted when it became apparent that Armenia had won. These claims were disputed by Armenia 1 director and Eurovision delegation leader Diana Mnatsakanyan, who also denied reports that the country was preparing to file a complaint with the EBU over the matter. She noted that the broadcaster did not know whether Azerbaijan even aired the contest at all, given that the country had not yet participated in the Junior Eurovision and had \\"no interest\\" in it at the time, and that reports about the alleged incident were limited to posts on Azerbaijani forums. Azerbaijan would ultimately make its official debut at the Junior Eurovision two years later. 2012 contest venue pictured) following a formal boycott by a group of local musicians. The 2012 Eurovision Song Contest was hosted by Baku, Azerbaijan after their win in 2011. Azerbaijan temporarily amended its visa policy to allow Armenians, who are normally barred from entering the country, to attend the event. However, in February 2012, a boycott effort emerged in Armenia following an incident where a 20-year-old Armenian soldier was shot dead on the border between the two countries. Armenian officials initially blamed the soldier's death on an Azerbaijani sniper; however, conflicting reports indicated that the death was the result of friendly fire. Also in February, Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev made a statement re-affirming the country's stance against Armenians, arguing that they control \\"hypocritical and corrupt politicians.\\" 22 Armenian musicians, including previous Armenian Eurovision representatives Emmy and Eva Rivas, signed an open letter supporting a boycott, stating that they would \\"refuse to appear in a country that is well- known for the mass killings and massacres of Armenians, in a country where anti-Armenian sentiments have been elevated to the level of state policy.\\" On 7 March 2012, Armenian officials announced that the country would withdraw from the 2012 contest. The EBU stated that it was \\"truly disappointed\\" with Armenia's withdrawal, and that \\"despite the efforts of the EBU and the Host Broadcaster to ensure a smooth participation for the Armenian delegation in this year's Contest, circumstances beyond our control lead to this unfortunate decision.\\" ƒ∞TV General Director Ismayil Omarov expressed his regret about Armenia's withdrawal, believing that the country's presence could have been a \\"joint peace message to the world.\\" Local politician Ali Ahmadov also criticized the Armenian delegation for its decision, stating that \\"[its] refusal to take part in such a respected contest will cause even further damage to the already damaged image of Armenia.\\" Due to its late withdrawal, Armenia was required to pay its entry fee, plus a fine totalling half the value of the entry fee.  2015 contest  Upon its unveiling in March 2015, media outlets characterized Armenia's entry in the 2015 Eurovision Song Contest, \\"Don't Deny\\", as being in tribute to the Armenian Genocide, whose centenary was commemorated on 24 April 2015. The song was performed by Genealogy, a group whose composition alludes to the forget-me-not by consisting of five Armenian diaspora, along with a sixth singer representing Armenia and their unity. \\"Don't Deny\\" was perceived by critics to be a call for recognition of the genocide, further noting that the song's music video contained a scene depicting the group's members posing for a family photo in World War I-era outfits, and then disappearing from sight. Gohar Gasparyan, head of Armenia's Eurovision delegation, described the song as being about love and unity, and did not make reference to any specific political intent or themes. Representatives of Azerbaijan‚Äîwhich, alongside Turkey, denies the genocide‚Äîcriticized the song for its alleged political themes, and stated that they would \\"act adequately\\" to prevent the contest from being \\"sacrificed to the political ambitions of a country.\\" On 16 March 2015, the Armenian delegation announced that the title of the entry had been changed to \\"Face the Shadow\\"; they stated that the new title was meant to \\"strengthen\\" the themes of the song, and to quell concerns over the alleged political subtext. The delegation continued to deny any specific political subtext in the song.  2016 contest  Despite the EBU allowing only the flags of full UN member states to be displayed at the 2016 contest, during the first semi-final on 10 May 2016, the Armenian representative Iveta Mukuchyan was seen holding the flag of Nagorno-Karabakh, sparking backlash from the Azerbaijani press. During a press conference following the semi-final, Mukuchyan responded to the incident by stating that \\"You don't have to forget that I am representing my country in my heart, my thoughts, my feelings, and all my emotions. My thoughts are with my motherland, and what I want to spread is peace on borders. I wrote 'LoveWave' because this was going on inside of me.\\" The EBU and the reference group released a statement the following day explaining that they \\"strongly condemn the brandishing of the Nagorno-Karabakh flag\\" during the live transmission of the first semi final, and consider the appearance \\"harmful\\" to the contest brand. The reference group has consequently sanctioned the Armenian broadcaster AMPTV, with the nature of the sanction to be determined citing a breach of the rule stating \\"no messages promoting any organisation, institution, political cause or other causes shall be allowed in the shows\\". Furthermore, the reference group has pointed out that a further breach of the rules of the contest could lead to disqualification from the year's event or any successive editions. Hikmet Hajiyev, the spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Azerbaijan called the action of Mukuchyan \\"provocative\\" and unacceptable claiming that \\"the Armenian side deliberately resorts to such steps to encourage and promote the illegal formation created in the occupied Azerbaijani territories‚Äù.Armenian provocation prevented at Eurovision Song Contest // azernews.az, 11 May 2016. 2019 contest After the final in 2019, ƒ∞ctimai TV, the Azerbaijani public broadcaster filed a complaint with the EBU for the graphics shown during the voting sequence.

He has been the Economic Adviser and Head of Research of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) since May 1, 2014. Previously, he was the Hughes-Rogers Professor of Economics at Princeton University since 2006, though he took a leave in December 2009 to advise South Korean President Lee Myung-bak on the international economy as well as help set the agenda for the G-20 Seoul summit in November 2010.  Education and career  Shin obtained a B.A. in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford University (Magdalen College) in 1985, an MPhil in Economics from Oxford's Nuffield College in 1987, and a DPhil in Economics from Oxford's Nuffield College in 1988. Shin became a Research Fellow in 1988 and Tutorial Fellow in 1990 at Magdalen College, Oxford. In 1994 he moved to the University of Southampton, where he became a Professor of Economics. He moved back to Oxford in 1996 as a University Lecturer in Economics and Faculty Fellow in Economics at Nuffield College. In 2000 he became a Professor of Finance at the London School of Economics. In 2006 he moved to Princeton University. In addition to his academic positions, Shin served as an advisor to Bank of England (2000‚Äì2005) and is a member of the Financial Advisory Roundtable at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a panel member of the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum since 2007. He is a Research Fellow of the Centre for Economic Policy Research since 1998. Shin was the Chairman of Editorial Board of the Review of Economic Studies from 1999 to 2003. He collaborated with Isabel Schnabel, comparing the Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers with the bankruptcy of Leendert Pieter de Neufville in 1763. Lessons from the Seven Years War by Isabel Schnabel and Hyun Song Shin Shin was elected a Fellow of the Econometric Society and of the European Economic Association in 2004, and a Fellow of the British Academy in 2005. He was awarded the R. K. Cho Economics Prize in 2009. In December 2009, Shin was named chief advisor to President Lee Myung-bak on international finance. He played a major role in formulating South Korea's macroprudential policy and helped develop the agenda for the G-20 during Korea's presidency, which culminated in the 2010 G-20 Seoul summit on November 11‚Äì12, 2010. In September 2013 the Basel, Switzerland‚Äìbased Bank for International Settlements (BIS) announced that Shin would begin a five- year term as its Economic Adviser and Head of Research starting in May 2014. In that role he would also serve as a member of the BIS Executive Committee.  Research contribution  Global coordination games belong to a subfield of game theory that gained momentum in 1998 when he published an article with Stephen Morris. Shin and Morris considered a stylized currency crises model, in which traders observe the relevant fundamentals with small noise, and show that this leads to the selection of a unique equilibrium. This result is in stark contrast with models of complete information, which feature multiple equilibria. In 2011 he won the second Financial Times annual essay contest on banking regulation sponsored by the International Centre for Financial Regulation. He wrote about how the G-20 major economies could increase financial stability with macroprudential regulations that \\"leans against the credit cycle\\" using examples from the UK, South Korea, and the United States. Specifically, he \\"advocated a global tax on non-core banking liabilities as the best way to deflate bubbles\\". Shin argues that \\"financial firms systematically take more risk as asset prices rise\\", which means that the financial system's vulnerability \\"cannot be measured by price indicators like credit spreads or volatility. Instead, analysts should focus on quantities like the amount of assets on intermediary balance sheets and the liquidity and maturity mismatches between those assets and the liabilities used to fund them\\".  Risk and Liquidity  He is known for this 2010 book Risk and Liquidity which opens with a quote from an anonymous risk manager who says: \\"The value added of good risk management is that you can take more risks\\". He then says that financial risk is endogenous, due to the thinking expressed in this quote and makes an analogy with London's Millennium Bridge in which the instability was also endogenous. When the bridge lurched to the side, everyone adjusted their footing at exactly the same time, to avoid falling over, and this caused a synchronized oscillation.  The Taper Tantrum  Martin Wolf credits him with coming up with the explanation for the huge global overreaction (called the \\"taper tantrum\\") to United States Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke's hint that he might taper quantitative easing in May 2013. Shin presented this theory at a conference on Asia at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in December 2013. Shin suggested that it was caused by the growth of demand for the private-sector bonds of emerging economies, and the resulting excess global liquidity.Martin Wolf, \\"The emerging risks of ticking time bonds\\", Financial Times, December 10, 2013 Sources * Stephen Morris and Hyun Song Shin (1998), \\"Unique Equilibrium in a Model of Self-Fulfilling Currency Attacks\\", American Economic Review, 88 (3): 587‚Äì97.

Early life Mogok Sayadaw seated. He was born Maung Hla Baw to Daw Shwe Ake and U Aung Tun in a small village close to Amarapura in Mandalay Province, Burma on 27 December 1899. Hla Baw began his education at 4, and enrolled as a samanera or novitiate at age 9 under U Jagara. He later left for Mingala Makuna Monastery at Amarapura to continue his religious studies. Monkhood In 1920, he was ordained as a bhikkhu (monk) in the tradition of Burmese Buddhism with the dharma name Vimala () which means \\"stainless, Undefiled.\\" As his monkhood was sponsored by the residents of Mogok, a town well known for rubies and gems, Vimala became known as \\"Mogok\\". In 1924, Vimala became the chief abbot of Pikara Monastery. He began to give sermons focusing on abhidhamma and teaching vipassana meditation. He attained Nirvana by practicing meditation for four years and became an Arhat. Then, he disseminated his method to the pupils for attaining Nirvana. He focused on the insight learning of the dynamic nature of mind and materials in his teaching. His teaching audio recordings are still available and learnt by Myanmar Buddhists to learn meditation methods. Legacy U Vimala established the Mogok tradition of vipassana meditation, which is independent of the meditation traditions established by his Burmese predecessors, Ledi Sayadaw and Mahasi Sayadaw. U Vimala stressed dependent origination and cittanupassana as part of meditation practice. There are currently over 300 meditation centers in Burma that teach his form of meditation.

He is today best known for his work in systematically cartographing all Dutch towns and cities of his time.  Biography  Little biographical information exists about Jacob van Deventer. His patronage would suggest he was Catholic. Despite his name, he was probably not born in Deventer, but in Kampen in the north of the Netherlands. His mother married a man called Roelof in Deventer in 1510, and Jacob probably grew up there. He first appears in the sources on 24 April 1520, when he enrolled at the University of Leuven under the name of \\"Jacobus de Daventria\\". On this basis, his date of birth is conjectured to have been around 1500‚Äì1505. In Leuven, Jacob's interests were first directed towards medicine and philosophy, but he then began to take an interest in geography and cartography. he later moved to Mechelen, from where in 1572 he relocated to Cologne to flee the upheavals of the Dutch Revolt against the Spanish rule. During his career as a cartographer in the Spanish royal service, he earned himself the title of \\"Imperial Cartographer\\" from emperor Charles V in 1540 (later changed to that of \\"Royal Cartographer\\", after the emperor's abdication in 1555).  Works  Jacob van Deventer was among the first to make systematic use of triangulation, a technique whose theory was described by his contemporary Gemma Frisius in his 1533 book, Libellus de locorum describendorum ratione. In 1536 he produced a printed map of Brabant, the first such map to be published in the Netherlands. He then launched into an impressive career as a mapmaker. In 1559, he was tasked by King Philip II with the project that was to become his life's work: the systematic cartography of all cities of the Netherlands.Utrecht University Library, Digital Map Collection The resulting maps were kept unpublished because of their military value. As a result, they later became forgotten and were rediscovered only in the late 19th century.Wouter Bracke, ‚ÄòJacob van Deventer e l'atlante di citt√† dei Paesi Bassi‚Äô, in Le citt√† dei cartografi.

In the course of fifteen years, he created between 250 and 260 city maps, covering an area from Friesland to what is today the north of France, and reaching into Luxembourg and the west of Germany. All maps were made according to the same scheme, using a scale of c. 1:8,000. Most were made in three versions: the first was a \\"minute\\" version or first draft of the city in its nearer surroundings, based on topographical data that was collected by surveying on the site, with texts in Dutch. Of these draft versions, 152 were discovered in 1859 in various provincial archives in the Netherlands and in the Royal Library of Brussels. (A number that were kept in Middelburg were later destroyed during World War II and are preserved only as copies). The second stage was a \\"main chart\\" (netkaart or hoofdkaart), representing a cleaned-up elaborated version of the previous minute map, with texts in Latin. A third map, termed a bijkaart (ancillary chart) was produced that showed only the city itself, without the surroundings. It contains only the fortification works and canals, and the principal buildings and streets. The main charts with their ancillary charts were preserved as a three-volume atlas in the National Library of Madrid. Of this, one volume has been lost; 179 maps are preserved (in addition to 152 drafts).

His reign witnessed the invasion of Burmese on Assam and its subsequent occupation by British East India Company. He was installed as King twice. His first reign ended when Ruchinath Burhagohain deposed him and installed Purandar Singha in his stead. His second reign ended with his defeat at the hands of the invading Burmese army. He continued his militant efforts to regain his kingdom as well as to keep Purandar Singha at bay. Finally he submitted himself to Burmese who induced him to believe that they will make him king. Instead he was seized and placed in confinement at Rangpur. After the defeat of Burmese in the First Anglo-Burmese War and subsequent peace Treaty of Yandabo on 24 February 1826 CE, Assam passed into the hand of British. Most of the members of Ahom Royal family were granted pensions. Chandrakanta Singha received a pension of 500 rupees. He first lived in Kaliabor and later on at Guwahati. He visited Calcutta in order to request the restoration of his kingdom but in vain. He died in 1839 CE soon after his return to Guwahati. Ancestry and birth Chandrakanta Singha was the second son of Kadamdighala Gohain and Numali Rajmao. Kadamdighala Gohain was the grandson of Lechai Namrupia Raja, the younger brother of Rudra Singha. Kadamdighala Gohain was holding the titular rank of Charingia Raja when the reigning monarch Gaurinath Singha died at Jorhat, in 1795 AD. Due to his personal friendship and also because of his support to Purnananda Burhagohain in suppressing the Moamoria rebellion, the Burhagohain raised the elder son of Kadamdighala Gohain named Kinaram Gohain as the new king of the Ahom Kingdom, who was then a mere baby of less than two years old. In 1795 Kinaram Gohain was proclaimed Swargadeo Kamaleswar Singha, the sovereign of Ahom Kingdom in Assam. Chandrakanta was born at Jorhat in 1797 AD, two years after his elder brother's accession to throne.Bhuyan Dr. S.K.

Tunkhungia Buranji or A History of Assam (1681-1826) 1968 page 196 During the coronation ceremony, young Chandrakanta was very nervous at the presence of so many people in the audience hall. He refused to sit on the throne unless his childhood friend Satram stood by him near the throne. The nobles hesitantly agreed and accordingly the coronation ceremony was completed.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1981 page 288 He was proclaimed Swargadeo Chandrakanta Singha, the sovereign of Ahom Kingdom. The Tai-Ahom priest conferred on Chandrakanta Singha the name Sudingphaa. The expensive Singarigharutha ceremony, the traditional Tai-Ahom custom of crowning the monarch, was withheld, owing to the poor financial condition of the state. First reign (1811‚Äì1818)  Being still a boy Chandrakanta Singha was unable to take much part in the government of the country, and the control remained with the Purnananda Burhagohain.Gait E.A. A History of Assam 1926 page 224 Purnananda Burhagohain transacted all the business in the name of the king without making any attempt to eclipse the king or obscure his name. He took the king around to important localities to give confidence to the people and instill in their minds respect for Ahom monarchy. While the Purnananda Burhagohain handled the affairs of state, the young king Chandrakanta Singha spend his time in amusement and fun in the royal palace in Jorhat among his friends and palace maids.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1981 page 289Barua Gunaviram Assam Buranji or A History of Assam 2008 page 103 Opposition with Purnananda Burhagohain As Chandrakanta grew up, he began to feel unrest at Purnananda Burhagohain's influence. With the help of his trusted friend Satram, who was raised to the rank of Charingia Phukan (officer in charge of administration of the region of Charing), Chandrakanta tried to free himself from Purnananda Burhagohain's influence and control. Chandrakanta often listened to Satram's advice in preference to nobles, and at last took to receiving them in audience with Satram seated at his side.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1981 page 292Barua Gunaviram Assam Buranji or A History of Assam 2008 page 104 The nobles protested, but in vain, and things rapidly went from bad to worse.Gait E.A. A History of Assam 1926 page 224 Backed by Satram and other associates, the young King flouted Purnananda Burhagohain's opposition to his marriage with Padmavati, the daughter of a Bhakat or disciple of Bengena-atia Satra, a commoner and raised her to the rank of Parvatia Konwari or Chief Queen, and thus violated the time-honored custom according to which royal partners had to be selected from the principal Ahom families.Bhuyan Dr. S.K. Tunkhungia Buranji or A History of Assam (1681-1826) 1968 page 197 In response to King's arrogant behavior, the nobles led by the Purnananda Burhagohain protested by refusing to grant the customary salute given to Chief Queen in the audience hall, thereby increasing the friction between two sides.Bhuyan Dr. S.K. Swargadeo Rajeswar Singha 1975 page 143 Conspiracy of Satram Satram was of the same age as the King, but he was unrivalled in his precocity and cunning. Satram, himself held high ambitions and was aware of the fact that as long as Purnananda Burhagohain exercised absolute control over state affairs, his ambitions will never be fulfilled. Therefore, he began to gather support against the Burhagohain from various quarters of the Ahom nobility. First of all, he misinterpreted Purnananda Burhagohain's motives and actions and gradually poisoned the ears of Chandrakanta Singha. Badan Chandra Borphukan, the viceroy of Guwahati, was made to believe that Purnananda Burhagohain was his enemy and the Burhagohain was planning to destroy him. Badan Chandra's daughter Pijou Gabharu, who had married to Oreshanath Dhekial Phukan, a son of Purnananda Burhagohain, was also made party to this belief.Bhuyan Dr. S.K. Tunkhungia Buranji or A History of Assam (1681-1826) 1968 page 197 Satram, along with his associates planned to assassinate the Burhagohain, while he was on his way to the royal palace. The plot was discovered and all the associates of Satram were arrested and duly punished.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1981 page 294 Satram fled to the Royal palace and sought refuge from the King. Meanwhile, Purnananda Burhagohain called on the Grand Council of the three Gohains, the Burhagohain, the Borgohain, and the Borpatrogohain. According to the custom of Ahom rule, the Grand Council of the three Gohains held absolute power. Unanimously, the Council could enthrone or dethrone a king and it could revert any order given by the king himself.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1981 page 295Barua Gunaviram Assam Buranji or A History of Assam 2008 page 105 A wave of panic ran across Chandrakanta Singha and the royal family. The Queen-mother, Numali Rajmao pleaded with Purnananda Burhagohain to spare her son, the king. The Burhagohain gave his word to the Queen-mother regarding the safety of the king, and in return, he demanded Satram be surrendered to the Grand Council. Chandrakanta Singha reluctantly agreed to surrender Satram on one condition that Satram's life be spared. The Grand Council of Gohains, held a trial on Satram, in which his guilts were proved. Satram was banished to Namrup, where he was soon afterwards killed by some Nagas.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1981 page 296 It was believed that Satram was murdered at the instigation of Purnananda Burhagohain. Many believed that the King himself was privy to Satram's conspiracy. All these events took place in June 1814.Bhuyan Dr. S.K.

A History of Assam 1926 page 224 Badan Chandra Borphukan flight to Burma News of Satram's fate reached Guwahati and Badan Chandra Borphukan became worried on account of his associations with Satram. In Jorhat, even though Purnananda Burhagohain suspected Badan Chandra Borphukan of favouring Satram's conspiracy, the Burhagohain initially hesitated to take action against him. But reports began to circulate of Badan Chandra's oppressive behavior and gross exactions on the people of Lower Assam, even as the conduct of his sons was even more outrageous. One of their favorite pranks was to make an elephant intoxicated with bhang and let it loose in Guwahati, while they followed at a safe distance, and roared with laughter as the brute demolished houses and killed the people who were unlucky enough to come in its way.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1981 page 297Barua Gunaviram Assam Buranji or A History of Assam 2008 page 106Gait E.A.

In 1815, a deputation was sent to arrest him; but, being warned in time by his daughter, Pijou Gabharu, who was married to one of the Burhagohain's sons, he escaped to Bengal.Bhuyan Dr. S.K.

Lord Hasting, however, refused to interfere in any way.Gait E.A. A History of Assam 1926 page 225 Meanwhile, Badan Chandra had stuck up a friendship with the Calcutta Agent of the Burmese government and he went with this man to the Court of Amarapura, where he was accorded an interview with the Burmese king, Bodawpaya. He repeated his misrepresentations regarding the conduct of Purnananda Burhagohain, alleging that he had usurped the King's authority, and that owing to his misgovernment, the lives of all, both high and low, were in danger.

Tunkhungia Buranji or A History of Assam (1681-1826) 1968 page 199 Purnananda Burhagohain sent an army to oppose the invaders. A battle was fought at Ghiladhari in which the Assamese army was routed. At this juncture Purnananda Burhagohain died or some say, committed suicide by swallowing diamonds,Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1981 page 301Barua Gunaviram Assam Buranji or A History of Assam 2008 page 108 leaving the entire Ahom government leaderless.Gait E.A.

The Ahom war council decided to continue the war; and a fresh army was hastily equipped and sent to resist the Burmese. Like the former one, it was utterly defeated, near Kathalbari east of Dihing. The Burmese continued their advance pillaging and burning the villages along their line of march. Ruchinath Burhagohain endeavoured in vain to induce Chandrakanta Singha to retreat to Lower Assam, and then, perceiving that the latter intended to sacrifice him, in order to conciliate Badan Chandra and his Burmese allies, fled westwards to Guwahati.Gait E.A. A History of Assam 1926 page 225-226 The Burmese occupied the capital Jorhat and Badan Chandra triumphantly entered the capital, interviewed Chandrakanta Singha and offered to run the affairs of the state in his capacity as Mantri-Phukan.

Tunkhungia Buranji or A History of Assam (1681-1826) 1968 page 200 Meanwhile, friendly overtures were made to Chandrakanta from the Burmese camp. An Ahom princess Hemo Aideo (also known as Bhamo Aideo) was offered to the Burmese Monarch Bodawpaya for the royal harem along with fifty elephants. Hemo Aideo was accompanied by a large retinue consisting of ladies and attendants. The Burmese were paid a large indemnity for the trouble and expense of the expedition, and in April 1817, the Burmese returned to their own country.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1981 page 304Barua Gunaviram Assam Buranji or A History of Assam 2008 page 109Gait E.A.

Many Ahom nobles including the Queen-mother Numali Rajmao was not happy with Badan Chandra's autocratic behaviour. She intrigued with Dhani Borbarua and Nirbhaynarayan Borgohain to destroy Badan Chandra.Bhuyan Dr. S.K.

The two assassins approached Badan Chandra one morning when he was rubbing his hand with clay after performing his ablutions on the riverside. When questioned as to the object of their visit, the two sepoys replied that it is customary for servants to come to pay respects to their masters and to persons of authority and eminence. Thus disarmed of all suspicion Badan Chandra continued washing in the water when Rup Singh dealt him a cut over the neck with his sabre which felled him to the ground. The Jamadar followed up the stroke and Badan Chandra breathed his last.Bhuyan Dr. S.K.

But Chandrakanta's peace with the Burmese, his support for Badan Chandra and his refusal to go down to Guwahati at the approach of the Burmese army, had raised the suspicion of Ruchinath Burhagohain that Chandrakanta was responsible for the attempts made against his father Purnananda Burhagohain followed by the visit of the Burmese troops.Bhuyan Dr. S.K.

Brajanath Gohain agreed and he came to Guwahati where he was joined by Ruchinath Burhagohain and his supporters. After gathering a force of Hindustani mercenaries and local levies, Ruchinath and his party proceeded up to Jorhat. Chandrakanta fled to Rangpur, leaving Luku Dekaphukan in charge of the capital.

Meanwhile, for more than a year, Purandar Singha and Ruchinth Burhagohain had been busy recruiting soldiers from Goalpara, Bengal and Bhutan, in Duars, an area located in the borders of Bhutan and Assam. With the aid of a Mr. Robert Bruce (he is credited for the discovery of tea in Assam), Purandar Singha's army was supplied with guns and firearms. With his army fully equipped, Purandar Singha sent his men under the leadership of Mr. Robert Bruce, to attack Chandrakanta Singha's forces in May, 1821. Purandar Singha's forces were defeated by Chandrakanta Singha and their commander Mr. Robert Bruce was taken prisoner. Robert Bruce was later released on his agreeing to enter under the service of Chandrakanta Singha and to supply his soldiers' firearms and ammunitions.Gait E.A. A History of Assam 1926 page 229 News of Chandrakanta's preparations alarmed the Burmese. They mobilized their troops in Upper Assam and marched towards Guwahati in September, 1821. Alarmed by the huge size of Burmese army, Chandrakanta retreated from Guwahati and halt at Hadirachowki (also known as Assam chowki), the western outpost of Ahom kingdom in Assam. At that time, the officer-in-charge of Hadirachowki, Holiram Duariya Baruah (later on, he would be appointed as Dhekial Phukan by Chandrakanta Singha ; he was the father of noted Assamese reformer, social worker and intellectual Anandaram Dhekial Phukan) was guarding the Ahom Kingdom's western border with British India, with a garrison of three hundred Sikh soldiers.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1981 page 319 When the Burmese attacked Hadirachowki, Holiram Duariya Baruah and his Sikh soldiers fought bravely. But the Burmese came in overwhelming numbers and Holiram's forces were defeated. He himself was injured by a rifle bayonet thrust inflicted by a Burmese soldier. Chandrakanta Singha and his followers retreated across the border into British ruled Goalpara district.Barua Gunaviram Assam Buranji or A History of Assam 2008 page 115 After this victory, the Burmese tried to expand their rule in other parts of Assam.

A History of Assam 1926 page 228 Meanwhile, Purandar Singha also retreated towards the border of Bhutan to rally his forces after his recent defeat in the hands of Chandrakanta Singha. Chandrakanta attempts to expel Burmese from Assam The Burmese seemed to have total control of the Ahom kingdom but Chandrakanta Singha was determined not to let the Burmese rest in peace. Towards the end of the 1821 A.D, Chandrakanta collected a force of about two thousand men, consisting of Sikhs and Hindustanis from British ruled Bengal.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1981 page 319Barua Gunaviram Assam Buranji or A History of Assam 2008 page 116 He rallied his men in the Goalpara district, and Mr. Robert Bruce obtained for him three hundred muskets and nine maunds of ammunition from Calcutta.Gait E.A. A History of Assam 1926 page 229 The Burmese troops and their followers were so numerous that it was found impossible to provide them with supplies in any one place. They were, therefore, distributed about the country in a number of small detachments. Chandrakanta Singha, seeing his opportunity, returned to the attack and, after inflicting several defeats on the Burmese,Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1981 page 319Barua Gunaviram Assam Buranji or A History of Assam 2008 page 116 laid siege to Guwahati.

The Burmese monarch Bagyidaw sent his finest general Mingi Maha Bandula to reclaim Assam with reinforcements of 20,000 soldiers. Undaunted by enemy strength, Chandrakanta Singha marched upwards into Upper Assam with approximately 2000 men consisting of Sikhs and Hindustani mercenaries and some local Assamese people recruited around Guwahati. After pushing the enemy forces back, he pitched his camp in Mahgarh (presently known as Kokilamukh; located in Jorhat district ) near the capital Jorhat.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1981 page 320Barua Gunaviram Assam Buranji or A History of Assam 2008 page 116 On 19 April 1822 A.D. the 20,000 Burmese led by Mingi Maha Bandula and the 2000 mixed Assamese-Hindustani forces led by Chandrakanta Singha fought the decisive battle at Mahgarh.Bhuyan Dr. S.K.

Unable to resist the Burmese with his small force, Chandrakanta Singha fall back to Hadirachowki (Assam chowki), where he made preparation to resist the Burmese with his mixed levies consisting of Sikh, Hindustanis and Assamese soldiers.

The Burmese commander sent an insolent message to the British Officer commanding at Goalpara warning him that, if protections were afforded to Chandrakanta Singha, a Burmese army of 18,000 men, commanded by forty Rajas( kings or chiefs), would invade the British territories and arrest him wherever he might be found. The British answered this threat by the dispatch to the frontier of additional troops from Dacca, and by the intimation that any advance on the part of Burmese would be at their certain peril. The British Officer was ordered that should Chandrakanta or any of his party, appears in Goalpara, they were to be disarmed and removed to a safe distance from the border. Chandrakanta Singha evaded capture by British authorities by bribing the native Indian officers serving under the British Officer.Gait E.A. A History of Assam 1926 page 230  Burmese atrocities on Assamese people and Chandrakanta imprisoned Even after their victory over Chandrakanta Singha, the Burmese suffered heavy losses, especially at the battle of Mahgarh. Therefore, they wreak their vengeance on common Assamese people, by committing numerous acts of atrocities.Barua Gunaviram Assam Buranji or A History of Assam 2008 page 116-117 They rob everyone who had anything worth taking. They burnt down villages, plundered the temples, violated the chastity of women, and put large numbers of innocent persons to death. Previously the Assamese people on the north bank of Brahmaputra, with the aid of hill tribes Akas and Daflas, successfully overthrew the Burmese rule by organizing resistances and harassing the Burmese troops by waging guerilla warfare. The Burmese now appeared in overwhelming force and crushed out all attempts of active resistance in the north bank of Brahmaputra. In revenge for the opposition offered to their army, the Burmese slaughtered a vast number of men, women and children. Many Assamese people fled to the hills, and to Jaintia, Cachar and British ruled Bengal.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1981 page 321Barua Gunaviram Assam Buranji or A History of Assam 2008 page 117Gait E.A. A History of Assam 1926 page 231-232 Meanwhile, the Burmese tried to revive diplomatic relationship with Chandrakanta Singha. They sent messages that they never meant to injure him, and had only set up Jogeswar Singha as King because he refused to obey their summons to return. Chandrakanta Singha, frustrated by his failure to recruit troops from Goalpara and Bengal, finally accepted the Burmese proposal of reinstalling him to the throne and surrendered to the Burmese in Hadirachowki. He was taken to Jorhat where he was seized and placed in confinement at Rangpur.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1981 page 322Gait E.A. A History of Assam 1926 page 232 Anglo-Burmese War and life as British pensioner In 1824 A.D. the First Anglo-Burmese War broke out. The Burmese was utterly defeated and were expelled from Assam, Cachar and Manipur. Finally the Burmese monarch sued for peace and the treaty of Yandabo was signed by both parties on 26 February 1826. According to the terms and conditions of the treaty, the Burmese monarch renounced all claims over Assam and British became the masters of the Brahmaputra valley.Bhuyan Dr. S.K.

A History of Assam 1926 page 288 After establishing their rule in Assam, the British granted pensions to the members of Ahom royal family and other Ahom nobles. Chandrakanta Singha was also granted a pension of 500 rupees per month and certain Khats or Estates in Upper Assam. He lived at first at Kaliabor and later on at Guwahati amidst the splendor which could be commanded by a fain√©ant prince.Bhuyan Dr. S.K. Tunkhungia Buranji or A History of Assam (1681-1826) 1968 page 213 Attempts to restore his kingdom Chandrakanta made several pleas to the British authorities to restore his kingdom, but every time it was turned down. Meanwhile, certain members of former Ahom royal family and nobles conspired to overthrow the British rule from Assam. Though, the conspiracy was detected in time and the conspirators were duly punished, the British authorities were concerned over the growing dissatisfaction among the people towards British rule. Therefore, in an attempt to pacify the people, in 1832 A.D., the British Government considers restoring Upper Assam to the former Ahom royal family as a tributary prince.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1981 page 338 The two most suitable candidates for the throne were Chandrakanta Singha and Purandar Singha . After some interviews with the candidates and discussions among the British Officers, Purandar Singha was selected for the throne. Officially the British authorities stated that Purandar Singha was young, his behavior was pleasing and his manners were extremely good and he had abilities for administrations,Gait E.A. A History of Assam 1926 page 296-297 but there was another side of the story. Chandrakanta Singha inherited the kingdom from his elder brother, the Ahom king Swargadeo Kamaleswar Singha, therefore the legal basis of Chandrakanta Singha was more firm than Purandar Singha. Purandar Singha lived most of his life in exile with his father; therefore if the British install Purandar Singha to the throne, he would be more grateful and will submit to British rule more readily than his rival candidate Chandrakanta Singha. In addition, if Chandrakanta become king, he had a reputation for his independent attitude and for his military exploits against the Burmese, could become a threat to the British rule in long term. Therefore, in April 1833, Purandar Singha was appointed as a protected prince in charge of Upper Assam, excluding Sadiya and Matak regions, on a stipulated tribute of 50,000 rupees.Bhuyan S.K.

Tunkhungia Buranji or A History of Assam (1681-1826) 1968 page 213 Wives and issues Through his Chief Queen Padmavati Kunwari, Chandrakanta had two sons and one daughter, Ghanakanta Singha Juvaraj, Hemakanta Singha Gohain and Devajani Aideo. His second wife, Rani Madamvika was the mother of Lambodar Gohain. His third wife Nirmilia Kunwari was issueless. He also had a number of concubines mostly recruited from Hajo.Bhuyan Dr. S.K. Tunkhungia Buranji or A History of Assam (1681-1826) 1968 page 213 Land grants, constructions and literature Like his predecessors, Chandrakanta granted lands to temples and religious places. He even made grants to Muslim-Dargahs of Shah Madar at Bausi, Shah Fakir at Barnagar, Panch peer at Khetri, Syed Shahnur Dewan Fakir at Bhella, where he granted hundred bighas(Indian land measuring unit) of lands. During his first reign, the Queen-mother Numali Rajmao excavated a pond, and dedicates it to Lord Vishnu. It was known as Vishnu-Sagar Pukhuri. But later on it came to be known as Rajmao Pukhuri and it is known as Jorhat Barpukhuri or Purani Kacharir Pukhuri.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1981 page 311 While Chandrakanta was living as British pensioner in Guwahati, under his instruction Bisheswar alias Bikaram Bezbaruah compiled a ballad (poetic description of historical events) on Moamoria rebellion and Burmese invasion of Assam.Bhuyan Dr. S.K. Swargadeo Rajeswar Singha 1975 page 34 Character and legacy Contemporary Chroniclers stated Chandrakanta as a weak king who was unable to hold his nerve and was easily manipulated by the advice of his ministers and friends. The events of his first reign throw evidence to these allegations when he acted merely as a puppet in the hands of his powerful ministers. However his second reign and his continuous efforts to free his kingdom from Burmese invaders throws light to another side of his character, the one which is courageous, brave and full of determination. He hated to live under submission and events of his life had proved it. Even during his first reign, he dared to throw off the influence of the Prime Minister Purnananda Burhagohain by marrying a commoner and appointing her as Chief Queen, despite protest from the Premier and other nobles. While living as a British pensioner in Guwahati, he injured his third wife Nirmilia Kuanri with sharp weapon after arguing with her. When the British officer in charge of Kamrup district, Major Adam White, warned him not to engage in such acts, Chandrakanta exclaimed \\"I am the scion of Tungkhungia clan. Only because I lost my kingdom, does it mean I even lost the power to punish my wife?\\".Bhuyan Dr. S.K. Swargadeo Rajeswar Singha 1975 page 19 In his lifetime, Chandrakanta witnessed the final days of Ahom kingdom, and its subsequent occupation by the Burmese and then by the British.

Many towns shown are on the Lower Greensand. The Lower Greensand Group is a geological unit, part of the quite widely remaining underlying geological structure of southeast England. South of London in the counties of West Sussex, East Sussex, Surrey and Kent, which together form the wider Weald, the Lower Greensand can usually be subdivided to formational levels with varying properties into the Atherfield Clay Formation, the Hythe Formation, the Sandgate Formation, and the Folkestone Formation. North and west of London - including Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire - it is referred to as the Woburn Sands Formation. In Oxfordshire it is known as the Faringdon Sand. In North Wiltshire as the Calne Sands Formation and in parts of Wiltshire, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire as the Seend Ironstone Formation.  Lithology  The Lower Greensand typically comprises loose, unconsolidated sandstone (termed rubblestone/rubble in construction) and sands of varying grain size with subordinate amounts of siltstones, mudstones (containing smectites and similar) and limestones. In the Weald of East Sussex the lowermost part of the group is recognised by green glauconitic clays with a basal bed of phosphate nodules. These clays are overlain by green sandy clays and silts and finally homogeneous fine grained sands.Lake, R.D. & Shepard- Thorn, E.R. (1987) Geology of the country around Hastings and Dungeness: Memoir for 1:50,000 geological sheets 320 and 321. British Geological Survey, London. The sediments are noted to become increasingly fine grained and glauconitic to the east.  Deposition  The Lower Greensand Group was deposited during the latter part of the Early Cretaceous Period, during the Aptian to Early Albian stages.Hopson, P.M., Wilkinson, I.P. and Woods, M.A. (2010) A stratigraphical framework for the Lower Cretaceous of England. Research Report RR/08/03. British Geological Survey, Keyworth. Page 15 The Group is the lowermost of two geological units that take their name from their colouration due to the presence of the mineral glauconite, the other being the Upper Greensand. The unit was deposited in shallow marine conditions. In southern England the unit sharply but continuously overlies rocks of the Wealden Group. While elsewhere as the sea level rose it covered previously emergent highs of Jurassic rocks, unconformably overlying them.  Engineering geology  The Lower Greensand is one of the most landslide-susceptible formations in the UK which to the year 2000 had at least 288 known occurrences in South-East England.Collison , A., Wade, S., Griffiths, J. & DEHN, M. (2000) Modelling the impact of predicted climate change on landslide frequency and magnitude in SE England. Engineering Geology, 55, 205-218. Of the formations within the Lower Greensand, the Atherfield Clay is the most prone to landslip.Codd, J.W. (2007) Analysis of the distribution and characteristics of landslips in the Weald of East Sussex. MSc dissertation, University of Brighton. Landslides are occasional, rapid movements of a mass of earth or rock sliding along a steep slope. They tend to occur after sustained heavy rain, when the water saturates overlying rock, making it heavy and liable to slide, others occur via soil creep is a very slow movement, occurring on very gentle slopes because of the way soil particles repeatedly expand and contract in wet and dry periods. When wet, soil particles increase in size and weight, and expand at right angles. When the soil dries out, it contracts vertically, assisting the soil slowly down a slope.Basic Summary of Landslides BBC Bitesize Geography A common geomorphological, chiefly dependent on the local hydrology such as hydraulic action, at the base of the Lower Greensand is an escarpment, where the Hythe Beds overlie the Atherfield and Weald Clays, which is particularly susceptible to landslide.Gallois, R.W. & Edmunds, M.A. (1965) British Regional Geology: The Wealden District. Her Majesty‚Äôs Stationery Office, London. Most slip is attributed to massive sandstones overlying weaker shales and clays. The back part of the slip in strongly permeable locations is prone to be straight downward on a rotational slip plane. This shift leaves a steep back face, or back-scar, with a toe raised significantly less. At ‚ÄòThe Roughs‚Äô in Kent, where a rotational slump occurred, slips of the Atherfield Clay (and all material above) have compromised sandstone blocks of Hythe Beds. Later translational slides have developed along a shear zone at the boundary between the slip material and the undisturbed underlying Weald Clay. This sort of rotational slip occurs regularly along the coastline between Hythe and Folkestone, where the drainage basin faces inland, exerting a steady force, where the water is subterreanean, outward towards the coastal cliffs.

It the first coastal gun designed and manufactured completely in Finland and was intended to replace the older 57 mm Nordenfelt and Hotchkiss guns, but the design was found faulty and only 11 pieces were constructed. They were used for training after World War II until retired in the mid‚Äì1960s. Background The 57 55 J was developed to replace the older 57 mm Nordenfelt and Hotchkiss guns which, while still usable, were getting old and only had iron sights for aiming. The desire of the Finnish Navy headquarters operational section to begin domestic manufacturing of coastal and naval guns also influenced the decision to develop 57 55 J. The prototype, partially based on the older Nordenfelt and Hotchkiss guns, was designed by Engineering Lieutenant Colonel Antero Albert Jokinen and was finished in 1941 in the Helsinki naval base. A series of 50 guns was ordered from Valtion Tykkitehdas (VTT, State Artillery Factory) in Jyv√§skyl√§ at the turn of 1941 and 1942, but only 10 guns were built in 1944‚Äì1945. With the prototype included, the final number was 11 complete pieces. Design flaws When the guns were test-fired in Jyv√§skyl√§, it was found that the slide of the semi-automatic mechanism was not strong enough and could bend. The second serious flaw was ammunition. The gunpowder ordered from Valtion Ruutitehdas (State Gunpowder Factory) was designed to produce a barrel pressure of 2800 atm resulting in muzzle velocity of 900 m/s. But when the same gunpowder batch was tested two years later, it produced a barrel pressure of 3500 atm, resulting in unacceptable barrel wear. At first Jokinen intended to settle for a muzzle velocity of 800 m/s, but in the end the muzzle velocity was reduced to 660‚Äì670 m/s, no better than the older 57 mm guns. Antero Jokinen was later criticized for attempting to build a \\"too good\\" gun, without considering the abilities of the Finnish industry at the time. Service use The 57 55 J was accepted for use as a training weapon in the 1950s because of a lack of suitable training guns and no funds to buy new ones. The old 57 mm Nordenfelt and Hotchkiss guns were worn-out, and 76 mm guns were kept in reserve, so the 57 55 J units, among other old guns, were used as training pieces. Some of the guns were converted for sub-caliber training for the 234/50 Be and 305/52 O guns. The guns were refurbished at the beginning of the 1960s and sub-caliber guns were converted back to the normal configuration, but the guns were removed from use and placed into storage in 1965‚Äì1966. Notes Sub-caliber training in this context refers to attaching a smaller weapon into a bigger one to reduce wear on the actual weapon. In the case of the 57 55 J, the gun, stripped of mounting and most other equipment, was attached into a barrel of a heavy gun. The 57 55 J was located outside the actual gun and fired normal ammunition; thus this does not refer to modern sabot ammunition or inner tube mounts.

Straubel (September 4, 1904 ‚Äì February 3, 1942) was a major in the United States Army Air Forces from Green Bay, Wisconsin. Straubel was Brown County's first aviation loss in World War II, and Green Bay‚ÄìAustin Straubel International Airport was named in his honor.  Early life  Austin was born to Carl A. and Alice C. (Van Dycke) Straubel on September 14, 1904, one of four children and the couple's only son. Austin Straubel's grandfather, H. August Straubel, was among the early settlers of Brown County, Wisconsin, arriving in 1846. August Straubel later joined the army and fought for the North in the Civil War. Straubel played tackle on the Green Bay East High School's football team. He attended the University of Wisconsin where he continued playing football. After graduating in 1927, he returned to Green Bay and worked at his father's business, Midwest Cold Storage. Straubel married Isabel Lawson Walthall in 1936 and they moved to Los Angeles, where they had two daughters, Susan and Victoria (\\"Tori\\"). Glenn, Justin. 2014. The Washingtons: A Family History. Volume 2: Notable Members of the Presidential Branch. El Dorado Hills, CA: Savas.  Military career  Straubel joined the army in 1928. In 1929, an aircraft that he was piloting in Michigan caught fire and crashed; Straubel parachuted to safety. On December 7, 1941, Straubel was commanding the 11th Bombardment Squadron, part of the 7th Bombardment Group (Heavy). The group was stationed at Hamilton Field, Hamilton Air Force Base California, and their ground support troops had sailed on November 21 for the Philippines. Straubel's squadron was preparing for their flight to the Philippines. The situation was confused: orders called for some aircraft to fly west while others flew east. Joined by the eight others in his crew, Straubel flew Consolidated LB-30 (B-24) AL-609, via the African route, arriving at Singasori Field, Malang, Java at 11:30 am on January 11, 1942. They were part of a mixed group of B-17s and LB-30s, some of which flew missions over the Pacific, while others, like Straubel, flew over the Indian Ocean. In early 1942 in the Pacific Theater of World War II, the Allies tried to prevent the Japanese from occupying Borneo called the Battle of Makassar Strait. At the time, Straubel was commander of the 11th Bombardment Squadron and acting commander of the 7th Bombardment Group. Five aircraft were assigned the group's first mission on January 16. Straubel led three LB-30s and two B-17s. The Liberators were to bomb the airfield at Langoan while the Fortresses were to attack ships in Manado Bay. Straubel earned the Distinguished Flying Cross for his efforts that day. Straubel, unhappy with the relationship between 5th Bomber Command and his 7th Bomb Group, decided to meet with Major General, Lewis H. Brereton Deputy Chief of Staff. After meeting with Brereton, he departed for Malang Indonesia with three passengers the next day. On February 3, 1942, Major Straubel was joined by 2nd Lieutenant Russell M. Smith, copilot, and Staff Sergeant George W. Pickett, flight engineer. The three were flying a Douglas B-18 \\"Bolo\\" (36-338) to Bandung, Indonesia. While flying over the Makassar Strait, Straubel's aircraft was attacked by Japanese Zeros and shot down. Straubel managed to land on an emergency airstrip, but he and the crew died from gunfire. According to another source, Straubel died from burns. Legacy Straubel was the first Brown County aviator to lose his life in World War II. In 1942, a U.S. Army camp in Australia was named after Straubel. On March 20, 1946, the Brown County Airport Committee asked the Brown County Board of Supervisors to \\"consider naming the new Brown County Airport in memory of Austin Straubel\\" and the Brown County Board of Supervisors signed a resolution to name their new airport Austin Straubel Field after Straubel for his dauntless courage, devotion to duty and self-sacrifice, and that he be recognized and honored in a memorable manner. Straubel, buried in Java, was reinterred at Green Bay's Woodlawn Cemetery on January 8, 1949.

Construction of the fort began in April 1861 and was completed by September 1864 at a cost of ¬£73,876. In later documents it is often referred to as Granite Fort. The fort originally had 18 9-inch R.M.L guns facing the sea behind iron shields, these guns were later upgraded and an extra 5 inches of armor was added. The fort was sold in 1930 but during World War II the fort played a significant role in the D-Day landings as it housed sixteen pumps for the PLUTO (Pipe Line Under The Ocean) operation to Allies supplied with fuel. Each of the 16 pumps supplied of fuel per day at a pressure of 1,500 lb per square inch. In the 1950s the site went on to house the Isle of Wight Zoo, which it continues to do so to this day.

Etymology The name Adimalathura may derive from the Malayalam word which encompasses the meaning of \\"A shore (sea shore) under the hill\\". The word adi means \\"under\\", and mala \\"Hill\\" and the last syllable thura means \\"shore (sea shore)\\". The local language of Adimalathura is a combination of Tamil and Malayalam languages, widely spoken by the older generation. History Literally the name means '(coastal) village below the hill'. It was part of the neighbouring place called Pulluvila. Adimalathura is hardly 1 km in length and half km in width. It is bordered by the Karichal lake in the eastern side, the Chowara hills in the north, rocks vanishing into the Arabian sea in the south and west. It languishes under the green canopy formed by coconut palms. A marvellous sight from anywhere. It is a traditionally Latin Catholic village and perhaps the only village with nearly 100% Christians. This village has two churches and two Schools- the parish church names after Our Lady of Fatima and the church at the far end of the village in the western side named after Our Lay of immaculate Conception. The School is named Louis Memorial UPS and St.Joseph LPS. The people are highly religious and take pride in being called the children of Our Lady. Traditionally people from this village belong to the fishing community, 99% of the population belong to the Christian church. Geography Adimalathura Catholic church The location of this village is at the top of a vast undersea submarine mountain range in the Arabian Sea. The land of Adimalathura encompass a territory spread over roughly 2 kilometers. It features thousands of shelters of which more than 10,000 are inhabited. Traditionally it was where the ancient Travancore kingdom ruled. Climate The temperature of this village ranges between 24 ¬∞C (75.2 ¬∞F) and 36 ¬∞C (96.8 ¬∞F) throughout the year. Although the humidity is relatively high, the constant cool sea breezes mitigate the heat. The weather in Adimalathura is also affected by the large Coastal belt of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The presence of this landmass causes differential heating of land and water. These factors set off a rush of moisture-rich air from the Arabian Sea over the Southern coastal region, resulting in tropical monsoons. Two seasons dominate this village: the dry season associated with the winter and the rainy season from the end of June to the end of August bringing strong winds. However, the weather patterns of this village do not always conform to the monsoon patterns of South Kerala. Heritage and resorts This village has traditional resorts which highly function as ayurveda resorts and heritage sites. Somatheeram Ayurveda Resort (the world‚Äôs first Ayurveda Beach resort), Manaltheeram Ayurveda Resort, Travancore Heritage and Abad Harmonia Ayurveda Resort can be found here.

Created in the 6th century, it reached its peak under the Abbasid Caliphate, when it served the main water supply for the Abbasid capital of Baghdad, while the regions irrigated by it served as the city's main breadbasket. Its destruction and progressive abandonment from the mid-10th century onwards mirror the Abbasid Caliphate's decline.  History  The dry bed of the Nahrawan Canal near Samarra, photographed by Gertrude Bell in 1909 The first irrigation works along the Diyala River were undertaken in Parthian times. Indeed, it may be that the lower part of the Nahrawan Canal was originally the lower course of the Diyala.Morony (1993), pp. 912‚Äì913 The large-scale canal system of early medieval times however was created in the reign of the Sassanid ruler Khosrau I (), who also established it as a separate administrative district (Bazidjan Khusraw). A treasury and mint were possibly established there. In early Islamic times, the town of Jisr al- Nahrawan in the middle of the canal was the site of the Battle of Nahrawan on 17 July 658 between Ali and the Kharijites under Abdallah ibn Wahb. Under the early Caliphates, and especially under the Abbasids who made nearby Baghdad their capital, the canal network was repaired and expanded, reaching its peak in the 9th and early 10th centuries. In Abbasid times, the region was divided into three tax districts, Upper, Middle and Lower Nahrawan. The canal was breached in 937/8, during the revolt of Bajkam against Ibn Ra'iq; the latter tried to impede Bajkam's advance from Wasit to Baghdad by flooding the region in between. The move barely obstructed Bajkam, but succeeded in destroying the agriculture of the region, hitherto the breadbasket of the Abbasid capital.Kennedy (2004), p. 197 As Hugh N. Kennedy writes, \\"the breach of the Nahrawan canal was simply the most dramatic example of a widespread phenomenon of the time; and it was symbolic of the end of ‚ÄòAbbasid power just as the breach of the Marib Dam was of the end of the prosperity of pre-Islamic south Arabia\\". The lower and middle Nahrawan were entirely abandoned for almost 14 years, until the Buyids under Mu'izz al-Dawla restored the canal. Nevertheless, the canal network continued to decline thereafter. As late as 1140, the Seljuq governor Bihruz tried to restore it, but according to the 13th-century scholar Yaqut al-Hamawi, infighting among the Seljuqs once again meant the neglect of the canal, and its use as a road by their troops compounded the destruction of the network. By Yaqut's time, the canal network had largely silted up and the countryside along them was abandoned.Le Strange (1905), pp. 59‚Äì60  Outline  Map of Abbasid-era Iraq, with the Nahrawan Canal marked out In medieval times, the main canal was divided into three sections, described in detail by the 13th-century geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi, in his Mu'jam al-Buldan. The initial feeder canal drawing water from the Tigris at Dur al-Arabaya near Samarra and carrying it to the Diyala at Ba'quba was called al-katul al-Kisrawi (\\"the Cut of Khosrau\\"). During its course, it was joined by three smaller canals taken from the Tigris, the Yahudi (\\"of the Jews\\"), the al-Ma'muni, named after Caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813‚Äì833), and the largest of the three, the Abu 'l-Jund (\\"arch warrior\\"), built under Harun al- Rashid (r. 786‚Äì809).Le Strange (1905), pp. 57‚Äì58 Some 20 km south of the inflow of the Abu 'l-Jund stood the town of Salwa or Bab Salwa (Basalwa), and a little further on the town of Ba'quba, the capital of the Upper Nahrawan district, some 50 km north-northeast of Baghdad. From there, the main canal, now known as the Tamarra, turned south to the towns of Bajisra (originally Bayt al-Jisr, \\"bridge-house\\") and finally Jisr al-Nahrawan, from where it was known as the Nahrawan proper. From Bajisra a canal, the Nahr al-Khalis, connected the main canal with the Tigris at Baradan and supplied the eastern suburbs of Baghdad with water, while another, the Nahr Bin, connected Jisr al- Nahrawan with Kalwadha south of Baghdad. Just south of Jisr al-Nahrawan there was another canal, the Diyala canal‚Äîthe present course of the namesake river‚Äîwhich joined the Tigris some 5 km south of Baghdad.Le Strange (1905), p. 58 Jisr al-Nahrawan itself was a wealthy place, as there the Khurasan Road connecting Baghdad with Central Asia crossed the canal. Surviving descriptions record that it was extended on both sides of the canal, each with its own mosques, markets and hostels for travellers and pilgrims. It was abandoned by the 14th century, as the road to Khurasan was diverted north, through Ba'quba.Le Strange (1905), p. 61 Below Jisr al-Nahrawan came a large Sassanid- era weir (Shadhurwan), followed by the towns of Jisr Buran/Puran (named after Ma'mun's wife), Yarzatiya, 'Abarta, another weir, and the city of Iskaf Bani Junayd, divided by the canal in upper and lower towns.Le Strange (1905), p. 59 From Iskaf, the canal went on for another 100 km amidst a heavily cultivated landscape to rejoin the Tigris at Madharaya, near modern Kut.Le Strange (1905), p. 60  References   Sources   * Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 6th century Category:Irrigation canals Category:Buildings and structures in Diyala Province Category:Tigris River Category:Iraq under the Abbasid Caliphate Category:Sasanian Empire Category:Khosrow I ","title":"Nahrawan Canal"},{"id":"24164150","text":"Alberto Di Bernardo (born 4 November 1980 in Rosario, Argentina) is an Italian/Argentine rugby union player, who gained four caps for in 2013.

Bari (loan) On 11 July 2014, after Rossini began training with English Championship club Leeds United, Leeds owner Massimo Cellino revealed the club was looking to sign Rossini on a year- long loan with the option to make the move permanent. However, on 13 July, Leeds opted to abandon the deal due to concerns of Rossini's lack of fitness, and the player returned to Sassuolo. Cellino said, \\"We want special players at Leeds United. Rossini didn't show enough during the three days he trained with the rest of the team. After speaking to him, it is clear that he didn't have the right attitude to join Leeds, so we have allowed him to leave.\\" On 17 July 2014, Rossini joined Serie B club Bari on loan from Sassuolo.

The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. It is an active Anglican church in the deanery of Widnes, the archdeaconry of Warrington and the diocese of Liverpool. History The tower dates from the 14th century and the rest of the church from 1758‚Äì59, replacing an earlier church on the site. Restorations were carried out in 1874, when a northwest vestry was added, and 1903. In October 1977, the church was the victim of an arson attack, leaving only the walls and the tower still standing. As a result of the fire there is nothing remaining of the restorations other than the vestry walls. Following the fire, the foundations of a narrower, timber-framed church were discovered. The roof and interior of the church were replaced by the architects Buxeby and Evans in 1979‚Äì80. Architecture Exterior St Mary's is built in red sandstone ashlar with a slate roof. Its plan is a rectangle in five bays with a west tower, a northwest vestry, a northeast gabled projecting chapel, and a south porch. The tower is square with corner buttresses and a crenellated parapet. It has a west door with a window above it. At the bell stage are two-light louvred belfry windows on all sides. The windows on each side of the body of the church are round-headed. The east window is Venetian in style, glazed in large squares, with a cherub carved in the keystone. John Middleton, the Childe of Hale Interior The roof, dating from 1979‚Äì80, is in varnished chestnut. It is panelled in five compartments, and heavily moulded. The west organ gallery, standing on Tuscan columns, is a replica of that destroyed in the fire. The furniture has been acquired from a variety of sources. The font, which consists of a bowl carved with cherubs, dates from the 18th century and spent a century in a garden. The oak pulpit dating from the 17th century stands on Tuscan columns; it came from York Minster. The pews came from the demolished church of St Mary, Ince-in-Makerfield. External features In the churchyard is the grave of John Middleton, known as the Childe of Hale, who was reputed to have been over tall. Also in the churchyard are the war graves of four soldiers of World War I and two of World War II. Opposite the church on the other side of the road is a wooden carving of John Middleton with other images of the village, called the History Tree, dating from 1996.

Military career  Born in Paris on 27 November 1898, Jacques Stosskopf was of Alsatian origin and spoke fluent German. Mobilized in 1917 as an officer in the French artillery, he was awarded the Croix de Guerre. Stosskopf was admitted to the √âcole polytechnique in 1920 and became a marine engineer in 1924. As a naval construction specialist, he was appointed in 1939 as head of the new construction unit at the Lorient arsenal and promoted to the rank of Chief Engineer, 1st Class.  Resistance hero  In June 1940, the base fell under control of the German Kriegsmarine, who used it to repair and resupply their U-boats. Beginning in September 1940, Stosskopf pretended to collaborate with the Germans, using his position to inform Allied forces of submarine movements at Lorient. Stosskopf was denounced under torture by a captured agent of the Alliance network within the French Resistance. He was arrested by the Gestapo in February 1944, but many French believed that the Germans had promoted him. The reality was quite different: Stosskopf was tortured by the Gestapo and deported under the Nacht und Nebel programme. He was executed at Struthof camp in Alsace on 1 September 1944, just before the arrival of the Allies.

Brooks, and illustrated by Kurt Wiese. When a hotel owner is forced to sell under mysterious circumstances, Freddy and his friend Mr. Camphor pose as campers to investigate. Plot summary Camphor and his butler Bannister appear at the Bean farm, asking Freddy to send Camphor‚Äôs visiting aunts packing. Aunt Elmira is demanding, fat and gloomy. Aunt Minerva is bossy; she regularly burns her cooking. The aunts planned to stay at the hotel across the lake, but it is suddenly haunted. As before in Freddy and Mr. Camphor, Bannister and Camphor enjoy their game of reciting proverbs, then deciding if they are appropriate. Punning, Bannister says, \\"Go to the ant, thou sluggard.\\"The Bible, Proverbs 6:6 Freddy and the cow Mrs. Wiggins walk to the estate, deciding that resolving the hotel‚Äôs problems will in turn solve Camphor‚Äôs problems. Camphor suggests that as campers, they can observe the hotel free of suspicion. Freddy grapples with the challenges of camping, such as making his first flapjacks (pancakes). Since animals would know Freddy, he is in disguise. Their first night they talk loudly ‚Äî to establish themselves as campers to anyone overhearing. Mischievously, Camphor pokes holes in Freddy‚Äôs cover story about studying with a witch doctor: :(Freddy) \\"'...you put them on and then wish for whatever you want.' :'And do you get your wish?' :'Sometimes. And sometimes not. All depending.' :'On what?' :'Oh, on general conditions. This and that.' :'Very clear,' said Mr. Camphor. 'From your description I feel that I could almost make one myself.'\\" (p. 54) There is a gunshot from the hotel. They find Mrs. Filmore, the owner, leaving the hotel on account of a ghost. They help her leave, but decide to remain themselves. Soon a lion-sized cat head smashes through a window, and they flee to camp. It is wrecked. On examination next morning, much of the hotel damage is caused by rats ‚Äî probably Simon‚Äôs gang. Freddy goes to Camphor‚Äôs for supplies, then to the Bean farm to update the animals. He is told of a meeting between Simon and the mysterious Mr. Eha, where the rat describes plans to attack the Camphor estate after Eha controls the hotel. Freddy returns to spy on the hotel, and overhears Simon plotting with Eha. Eha dons a ghost costume, and leaves to scare the campers: Freddy slips into the hotel, leaving mothballs in Eha‚Äôs coat pocket, so as to track him by smell. Freddy hurries back to camp, but Eha escapes. Mr. Bean is at Camphor‚Äôs estate: to general surprise his is adeptly flattering Aunt Minerva. The mothball smell is tracked to a Mr. Anderson in town. Realizing that Anderson is \\"Eha\\", Freddy barges into his office disguised as a doctor. The pig‚Äôs doctoring routine is unconvincing, and Freddy flees. On a tip, the pig guesses that a tourist camp on the lake is a hideout. There, he finds his old adversary, Simon the rat. Simon is working with Anderson. Freddy uses the opportunity to slyly hint that the Bean farm will be undefended that night. Therefore everyone is actually prepared when Anderson and the rat gang come. Mrs. Bean calmly treats Anderson‚Äôs ghost disguise as the ghost of Mr. Bean‚Äôs grandfather. Anderson is routed by the animals‚Äô own ghost versions, and the rats surrender after a shotgun blast. Kind treatment from Mr. Bean, Camphor and the animals brings a change in Camphor‚Äôs aunts. Minerva is pleasant, and proves to be a good cook. Gloomy Elmira is so taken with Freddy‚Äôs poem about a swamp she decides to vacation there immediately. A group returns to camp near the hotel. Anderson is there, renovating. When he visits, Bean spiders return with him, as spies. Knowing that Anderson has a terrible temper, insects are sent to bug him, especially to ruin his sleep. The fire department is called to a false alarm on the hotel property. Freddy sabotages Anderson‚Äôs car. When finally they confront the sleep-deprived Anderson, he is forced to return the hotel to Mrs. Filmore. Seeing they have lost, the rats leave. With all the problems resolved, the campers decide to continue enjoying their stay outdoors.

Nova Scotia's wineries are primarily organized under the Wine Association of Nova Scotia, though not all wineries are members. The industry began in the late 1970s with the original Grand Pr√© Winery in the Annapolis Valley of Nova Scotia.  Location  The Nova Scotia wine region can be divided into 4 main regions: Annapolis Valley, Gaspereau Valley, South Shore, and the Malagash Peninsula. Besides these main regions, grapes intended for wine production are being produced by independent growers across the province, including Cape Breton Island.EILEANAN BR√àAGHA VINEYARDS  History  Grape growing in Nova Scotia has been documented as early as the 1600s, where writing has noted that vines were planted in Annapolis Royal. In 1634 the governor of Acadia, Isaac de Razilly, wrote, ‚ÄúBordeaux vines have been planted that are doing very well,‚Äù making the first mention of wine grape cultivation anywhere in Canada. . Razilly‚Äôs vineyard in La H√®ve (now LaHave ‚Äî Riverport to be precise). The Kentville Research Station in Kentville, Nova Scotia began working with experimental grape varieties in 1913.Allison Lawlor, Nova Scotia horticulturist created important new varietals, Globe and Mail, November 9, 2011 One of the most successful varieties was the grape Vineland 53261, originally produced in Vineland, Ontario, and now commonly known as L'Acadie Blanc. Residence of the chief researcher at the Kentville research station where experimentation with grape varieties began about 1912 A Cellared in Canada wine operation began in Truro in 1964 as part of the Peller brand,Andrew Peller Limited, Company history but commercial grape production in Nova Scotia is undocumented until 1979 with the arrival of Grand Pre Winery, owned by Roger Dial, founder of Appellation America. As Dial was planting and growing the L'Acadie Blanc variety and others at his vineyard in Grand Pre, Jost Vineyards under Hans Jost also began in the early 1980s on the Malagash Point peninsula next to the warm waters of the Northumberland Strait and Amet Sound. The Jost vineyard is still known as the longest running winery in Nova Scotia. Gaspereau Vineyards vines are situated on a south-facing slope to maximize sun exposure The industry has since expanded slowly but steadily, introducing wineries such as St. Famille, Gaspereau Vineyards, Blomidon Estate Winery in the 1990s and fruit wineries such as Lunenburg County Winery. In 2003, the Wine Association of Nova Scotia (WANS) was created, of which most participants of the industry are members. The organization has served to promote and coordinate the efforts of the province's wineries. By 2015 there were 70 grape growers and nearly two dozen wineries in the province.Robert Bell, Wines of Canada: Nova ScotiaWines of Nova Scotia There were of vinyards in production in 2015. In December of that year, the provincial government announced funding to support the expansion of the industry, with a goal of doubling production by 2020.  Climate  Nova Scotia's climate varies from region to region and grapes grow best where there is a favorable microclimate. Each region's temperatures and soils differ significantly, allowing for different varieties to excel in separate areas. In good climates in the province, temperatures rarely drop below -23 degrees Celsius, allowing greater variety of vines to be grown compared to colder regions such as the Cape Breton Island.  Varieties  Nova Scotia's primary focus on grape growing for wine production had been hybrid vines, due to their cold hardy and disease-resistant nature. In recent years, Nova Scotia's wineries attempted to grow vinifera in significant amounts, to moderate success. ;Hybrid Vines * L'Acadie blanc * Seyval Blanc * Vidal Blanc * New York Muscat * Mischurnitz * Seyverni * Geisenheim 318 * Baco Noir * Marechal Foch * Luci Kuhlmann * Leon Millot * Castel * Cabernet Foch * De Chaunac * Marquette ;Vinifera Vines *Chardonnay *Pinot Noir *Pinot Gris *Riesling *Sauvignon Blanc *Cabernet Franc *Chasselas *Gamay Noir  Styles  A young L'Acadie blanc vine being trained in Nova Scotia. Sparkling Outside Nova Scotia, it is best known for its sparkling wine, as most production is consumed locally. Wineries including Benjamin Bridge, L'Acadie Vineyards, and Blomidon Estate Winery have developed extensive sparkling wine programs focusing on those produced in the traditional method style. Some of them are sold outside the province. White Nova Scotia white wines exhibit a crisp, fruity nature. Though for some time only hybrid white grapes were produced in any quantity, white vinifera in Nova Scotia have seen some level of success, particularly with Chardonnay and Riesling. Tidal Bay The appellation blend of Nova Scotia was created by the wineries of the province and WANS, and was initially released in 2012.Tidal Bay Appellation Intended to highlight the white wines of the region, Tidal Bay features 100% Nova Scotia grown grapes held to a rigorous set of standards to ensure they remain within the stylistic guidelines.Wines of Nova Scotia Red Reds in Nova Scotia remain relatively unknown outside of the province. Most red vinifera will not ripen to an acceptable level for table wines in Nova Scotia, though Pinot Noir and Gamay grapes have been produced to some success in the Bear River valley at the western end of the Annapolis Valley.Craig Pinhey, Top Atlantic Canadian red wines, East Coast Living, November 25, 2013 Nonetheless, there is popular local demand for hybrid reds, including Baco Noir, Mar√©chal Foch, Luci Kuhlmann, and Leon Millot. Icewine Icewine is produced by most wineries, primarily with the Vidal Blanc grape, though others, including Riesling, have been used. Production in the province is small enough that most production is done by an independent grower, Warner Vineyards in Lakeville.

Directed by Joseph Lee and written by Danny Smith, the episode originally aired on BBC Three in the United Kingdom on June 20, 2010, and has not been allowed to air in the United States on Fox, the original television network of the series, due to its controversial nature. This is the last episode that is presented in standard format, before the series' switch to high definition format, and it is the final episode to feature the opening sequence that was updated during the second season. In the episode, Lois is approached by an old friend from college who asks her to become a surrogate mother. After arguing with her husband Peter who is against the idea, Lois agrees and undergoes in vitro fertilisation. However, while Lois is pregnant, the biological parents are killed in an automobile accident. Lois and Peter have to decide whether to abort the fetus, or carry it to term and give the baby up for adoption. Peter attempts to persuade his wife to get an abortion but changes his mind after pro-life activists convince him that abortion is murder. Despite Peter's objections, Lois goes ahead with the abortion. Critical responses to the episode were mostly positive; critics praised the storyline, cultural references and its assessment of the subject of abortion. The episode was watched in just under a million homes in its original airing in the United Kingdom. Guest performances included Gary Beach, Jackson Douglas, Phil LaMarr, Will Sasso, Julia Sweeney, Wil Wheaton and Michael York, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. \\"Partial Terms of Endearment\\" was released on DVD in the United States, along with Seth and Alex Almost-Live Comedy Show, on September 28, 2010. Even though this episode was placed at the end of season 8, the episode was placed between \\"Go Stewie Go\\" and \\"Peter- assment\\" in the UK. Plot While attending her college reunion at Salve Regina University with Peter, Lois spots her old roommate, Naomi Robinson, with whom she had a brief lesbian relationship in college. Peter is shocked but excited to discover that Lois was bisexual in college. Naomi indicates that she would like to discuss an important matter with them at their home. Assuming that he will participate in a threesome with Lois and Naomi, Peter sends Chris, Meg, Stewie, and Brian out of the house. After Naomi arrives, she introduces her husband Dale. Peter expects that they will now be participating in an orgy, and tries to seduce the three of them while dressed in various costumes. When they clear the air to a dismayed Peter that they're not there for sex, Naomi and Dale tell Lois and Peter they've had trouble conceiving and ask Lois to be a surrogate mother for them, and Lois considers the matter. As the family eats breakfast the next morning, Lois reveals her intention to become a surrogate mother for Naomi and Dale, causing Peter to become upset at the thought of her being pregnant for nine months. Despite this, Lois decides to go to Dr. Hartman to have the in vitro fertilization performed, enduring more of Dr. Hartman's shtick involving celebrity crossbreeds and having a tribe of bush men implant the egg with blowguns. A pregnancy test comes back positive the next day, and a furious Peter attempts to cause Lois to have a miscarriage before ultimately confronting her about the pregnancy. While she continues asserting her intention to provide a child to Naomi and Dale, Quahog 5 News suddenly reveals that Naomi and Dale died in a car crash on Interstate 95, ironically after Dale won the lottery. Devastated by the announcement, Lois questions whether she should have an abortion or continue with the pregnancy and put the baby up for adoption. In an attempt to come to a decision, Lois and Peter decide to visit the local family-planning center, and ultimately decide to abort the embryo. However, as Peter exits the center he encounters an anti-abortion rally, where he is shown an anti-abortion video by one of the protesters. The video causes him to reconsider about aborting the unborn baby. Returning home, Lois continues to advocate her right to choose, while Peter now attempts to argue the unborn child's right to life and whether Lois has the responsibility of carrying it to term. At their wits' end, the two decide to discuss the matter on civil terms. At dinner, Lois talks with the family about \\"the wonderful new member of the Griffin family\\", but then, after a few seconds of silence, Peter turns to the camera and says to the audience \\"We had the abortion\\", promptly ending the episode. Production and development The episode was first announced at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International on July 25, 2009, by series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane. It was written by fellow executive producer and series regular Danny Smith and directed by Joseph Lee, during the show's eighth production season. The storyline was pitched by series regular Tom Devanney, and periodically references Billions and Billions (1997), a book of essays by Carl Sagan. Seth MacFarlane asked Danny Smith to read Sagan's essay, \\"Abortion: Is It Possible to Be Both 'Pro-Life' and 'Pro-Choice'\\", before beginning to write the script. The episode was originally intended to air along with the rest of the eighth season schedule, and was approved for production by 20th Century Fox. However, the Fox Broadcasting Company asserted their right not to air the episode due to the subject matter. This was the second time that MacFarlane had been warned by Fox about the sensitive nature of an episode's subject. Previously, the network had also disapproved of the season 3 episode \\"When You Wish Upon a Weinstein\\", which was originally prevented from airing on Fox, but finally aired on Adult Swim, and eventually on Fox more than four years after it was rejected. Thinking the same would happen with \\"Partial Terms of Endearment\\", MacFarlane believed that Fox would eventually run the episode on their network, stating, \\"Most of the time these things turn out to be nothing.\\" In a statement released by Fox, they noted their full support of \\"the producers' right to make the episode and distribute it in whatever way they want.\\" Series' creator Seth MacFarlane announced on July 25, 2009 at the San Diego Comic-Con that the episode had been banned by Fox. At the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International, MacFarlane announced that the episode would become available on a special DVD release, with series producer Kara Vallow confirming the release would be available on September 28, 2010, along with Seth and Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show. A month after the announcement, Kevin Reilly, President of Fox Entertainment, stated that the final decision not to air the episode was largely due to concerns about finances and advertisers: \\"Of all the issues, is the one that seems to be the most of a hot button. Particularly at that moment in time, the economy was really struggling and there were a lot of very tough conversations going on with clients.\\" Reilly said that \\"the advertisers know what they‚Äôre getting\\" with Family Guy, and he thought that the episode handled the subject fine, but \\"this one felt like it could cause trouble, and it was just not worth it.\\" Despite the concerns in the U.S. about the episode, it aired on June 20, 2010, on BBC Three in the UK, as a part of the season's regularly scheduled Sunday night run on the station. Although it was originally speculated that Adult Swim might air the episode, Adult Swim stated that there were no plans to air it on their network. Several months before the episode debuted on television, the script was performed in a live table read at the Ricardo Montalb√°n Theatre in Hollywood, California on August 12, 2009. The special reading was attended by Academy of Television Arts and Sciences voters on the heels of the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards. Family Guy was nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series, becoming the first animated program to be nominated in the category since The Flintstones in 1961. Commenting about the event, MacFarlane said, \\"We did this to drum up Emmy votes, so we could lose by fewer votes.\\" In addition to the regular cast, actor Jackson Douglas, then-husband of Alex Borstein, appeared in the episode as Dale Robinson, actress Julia Sweeney appeared as Naomi Robinson, actress Rutina Wesley appeared as Cheryl, actor Wil Wheaton cameoed as an anti- abortion protester and actor Michael York voiced the nature narrator. Actor Gary Beach, voice actor Phil LaMarr, and comedian/actor Will Sasso guest starred as various characters. Recurring guest voice actress Alexandra Breckenridge, actor Ralph Garman, and writers Danny Smith, Alec Sulkin and John Viener made minor appearances throughout the episode. Recurring guest cast member Patrick Warburton guest appeared in the episode as well. This episode marked Sweeney's first guest appearance since the season two episode \\"Wasted Talent\\". \\"Partial Terms of Endearment\\", along with Seth and Alex Almost-Live Comedy Show, was released on DVD in the United States on September 28, 2010. The set includes a brief audio commentary by Seth MacFarlane, voice actress Alex Borstein, writer Danny Smith and director Joseph Lee, as well as animatics, a table read of the episode, and nine downloadable original Family Guy songs. It was also released for digital retail in the United States the same day without the bonus features included on the DVD. Clips from the episode were shown during the special Family Guy: 200 Episodes Later, in which MacFarlane describes it as being the closest the writers have come to doing a modern-day All in the Family episode. Additionally, Smith calls it a relatively balanced and intelligent discussion of a very difficult subject and Sulkin claims that it, like \\"When You Wish Upon a Weinstein\\", is not controversial at all. Cultural references The episode parodied pro-life protesters. In the opening scene of the episode, Peter and Lois are shown entering her alma mater at Salve Regina University in Newport, Rhode Island. Later, after they are approached by Lois's ex-roommate Naomi and her husband Dale, Lois announces her intention to carry the couple's baby, causing Peter to question why Lois is the one who has to become the couple's surrogate. Their daughter, Meg, suggests that she could carry the baby herself, but Lois objects due to Meg's inability to have a boyfriend \\"for more than a few weeks.\\" Meg notes her relationship with Sesame Street character Count von Count, who only left her after discovering she had at least three nipples. Before Lois prepares to undergo in vitro fertilization, Dr. Hartman shows her several photos of babies conceived by celebrity couples, including actress Shelley Duvall and singer-songwriter James Blunt; actress Hilary Swank and actor Gary Busey; Olympic medalist Florence Griffith-Joyner and physicist Stephen Hawking; and actress, writer and comedian Tina Fey and actor Joaquin Phoenix. Beginning the procedure, Lois objects to Dr. Hartman's method of embryonic insertion. In response, he replies, \\"Well, perhaps you could tell them‚Äîif only you spoke Hovitos,\\" a reference to Raiders of the Lost Ark. Later, in an attempt to cause Lois to have a miscarriage, Peter lays down a series of Grey's Anatomy DVDs in order to lure Lois into being punched in the stomach by the \\"Acme Miscarriage Kit\\", a boxing glove attached to a crossbow. In a reference to the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoon series Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner, Peter ultimately ends up missing with the crossbow, causing the glove to bounce and hit a large rock and land inches in front of him as he is standing on a narrow cliff. The ground then drops out from underneath his feet, causing him to fall like Wile E. Coyote. As Peter exits the abortion clinic, he notices a pro-life rally nearby. At the rally, a protester shows Peter a video tape discouraging abortion (as a reference to the cult classic 1936 American propaganda exploitation film Reefer Madness), portraying it as murder, larceny, jaywalking and securities fraud. The tape claims that abortion prevented Nazi leader Adolf Hitler's would-be assassin, a fourth Stooge brother, of The Three Stooges, and Islamic extremist Osama bin Laden's America-loving brother from being born. Reception The episode was viewed in just under a million homes in its original airing on BBC Three in the United Kingdom, earning an audience share of 5.7 percent, despite airing simultaneously with Desperate Housewives on E4. The reception of the episode represented a slight decrease from the previous week's ratings. Reviews of the episode's release on DVD were mostly positive, calling the episode \\"wickedly funny, no matter how offensive.\\" Frazier Moore of the Associated Press commented that \\"What, in other hands, could have been a serious, even heart- wrenching story is on Family Guy a devilish burlesque ‚Äî not to mention a wickedly astute examination of the current abortion clash.\\" Moore also noted, however, that \\"the uninitiated, the faint-of-heart and, most of all, the anti- abortion crowd should maybe choose to take a pass.\\" Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times deemed the episode \\"typical of that audacious Fox animated comedy, teeming with rapid-fire jokes and willfully offensive non sequiturs about disabled animals, God, Nazis, bodily functions and the sexual habits of 'Sesame Street' characters.\\" In a slightly more mixed review of the DVD release, Cindy White of IGN criticized the episode for its shock value, but appreciated \\"that the writers didn't cop out in the end, and actually picked a side.\\" White went on to comment that it was \\"hard to believe that the writers ever expected 'Partial Terms of Endearment' to make it to air\\" and that \\"even devoted, longtime fans of the show may be a little uncomfortable with the subject matter.\\" White gave the release a 7 out of 10 rating. Assessing Family Guys impact on television, Mary Elizabeth Williams of Salon commented on the portrayal of abortion: \\"That Family Guy, that doofy, generally unfunny bastion of sophomoric jokes, should be one of the few shows brave enough to even address the topic is bananas And that Fox wouldn't air the episode says we're still a long way from having anybody on 'Glee' or 'The Office' or 'House' look at those telltale lines on the stick and finally decide what millions of American women have ‚Äî that they're just not ready for motherhood.\\" Controversy and removal The episode was banned from airing on the Fox Broadcasting Company due to concerns over its portrayal of the controversial subject of abortion. This is the second episode of Family Guy to be prevented from airing during the episode's respective regular season run; the first episode was the third season's \\"When You Wish Upon a Weinstein\\". Unlike that episode, Cartoon Network's adult-oriented block Adult Swim refused to air \\"Partial Terms of Endearment\\" upon Fox's request. It was first announced at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International.

It was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in 2007. Description Approximate area covered by Tabula Hungariae. The map is approximately 65√ó85 cm in size and is oriented in southwest-northeast direction. It shows the settlements and landmarks of the Kingdom of Hungary in the early 16th century. The southern areas occupied by the Ottoman Empire are marked with different colors. As the only covered parts outside the border are in the south, it is thought that the purpose of the creation of the map was the preparations for the war against the Ottomans. Some of the settlements shown on the map vanished during the years of Ottoman wars and oppression. The most valued information on the map are the names and descriptions of settlements. There are approximately 1400 geographical names on the map, of which 1270 are names of settlements (365 on the territory of post-Trianon Hungary.) At the bottom of the map is the description of the country in German and Latin. Names of settlements The geographical names were transcribed differently from today. For example, today's √© was written ee, today's √∂ was ew. It is also noted that c is sometimes written tz, which is a characteristic of the Old High German orthography. These may be created by contributors, who prepared the work for printing. However, with some other names, L√°z√°r used the pronunciation of Hungarian dialects. Printing The map was printed with the aid of Georg Tannstetter, was paid by Johannes Cuspinianus, in the press of Petrus Apianus in Ingolstadt. Legacy There were only a few maps printed, almost all of them lost through history, so researchers could only know it from descriptions. However, in the early 1880s, one map was unexpectedly found. It was bought by collector S√°ndor Apponyi in 1882. The map was transferred in 1924 to the National Sz√©ch√©nyi Library, and is also there currently. Later versions There had been made several copies of the original map until 1552 but these did not survive. However, there were maps made using L√°z√°r's map also after 1552, with title Tabula Hungariae, illetve Nova descriptio totius Hungariae.

Belson played international rugby for the British Isles on their 1899 tour of Australia. Personal life Belson was born in Ramsgate in Kent in 1874 to Berkley George A. Belson, a retired Royal Navy Commander originally from Woolwich and Sarah Belson from New South Wales, Australia. His family were originally from Portsmouth, but Belson moved to the South-West of England as a child, where he was educated at Clifton College. As an adult he entered the banking profession and worked for the National Provincial Bank. He followed a banking career for several years taking up positions around the Somerset and Wiltshire areas, and even took a post in Abergavenny in Wales in 1896; but by 1897 he was back in Somerset. In 1899, Belson was invited to join the British Isles rugby team on their tour of Australia, but was denied the six-month leave by his employers. He decided to take the opportunity regardless, and left for Australia in May that year, understanding his job was forfeit. In September 1899, a month after the end of the rugby tour, the Bath Chronicle reported that Belson had taken an appointment in Sydney, showing a commitment to stay in Australia. In 1900, Belson joined the newly formed Imperial Yeomanry, and travelled to South Africa to serve the British Army in the Second Boer War. He joined Thorneycroft's Mounted Infantry, and reached the rank of Lieutenant.

In September 1897, Belson turned out for a trial game for Newport RFC, but there are no records of him playing a full game for the senior XV. In 1899 Belson was invited to join Matthew Mullineux's British Isles team, on their tour of Australia. There is conflicting evidence to how many games Belson played out of the 21 matches of the tour, ranging from four to seven.Frederick Belson Lions career lionsrugby.com There is no doubt over Belson's single international game, and all sources state that he played in the First Test against Australia.

Biography Dobrovich was born in the northern Thracian city of Sliven, then part of the Ottoman Empire, to a freeze dealer and a rich stock breeder's daughter. In 1830, Dimitar left for Wallachia with his grandfather, where he lived in Ploie≈üti and BrƒÉila, but he did not settle and returned to Sliven. In 1834‚Äì1837, he studied at the Phanar Greek Orthodox College in the imperial capital Istanbul, where he became an acquaintance of revolutionary Georgi Rakovski. Dobrovich continued his education in Athens, the capital of the Kingdom of Greece, where he attended a high school (1837‚Äì1840). He was then tutored by French painter Pierre Bonirote before enrolling at the Greek Technical School of Arts, where he was a student of Italian painter Raffaello Ceccoli. It was at that time that Dobrovich started painting portraits under the Hellenized name Demetrios Dobriadis. In 1848, Dobrovich moved to Rome to enroll at the Rome University of Fine Arts. In the same year, he took part in Giuseppe Garibaldi and Giuseppe Mazzini's uprising and fought actively for three months. Dobrovich graduated from the academy five years later to become the first academically-trained Bulgarian artist. He returned to Bulgaria in 1893, when the country was an autonomous Principality of Bulgaria already liberated from Ottoman rule. He died in 1905 in his native Sliven. Works While living in Athens, Dobrovich created icons for local Orthodox churches. However, he broke up with the canonical approach of iconography shortly thereafter to adopt a secular style of painting. Some preserved works from this Greek period include Portrait of a Greek bishop (1842‚Äì1843), Portrait of the wife of Italian painter Raffaello Ceccoli (1842‚Äì1847, National Art Gallery), Portrait of a girl (c. 1850, National Art Gallery) and Portrait of religious writer Eugenios Voulgaris. Dobrovich developed as a mature artist in Italy, embracing the style and vision of the late Italian Romanticism. Dobrovich depicted scenes from the daily life of the Italian people, for example Spinner woman, Italian villagewoman, Italian villagewoman with a jar atop her head, Village girl with goats, etc. Later in his career Dobroviched turned to oil painting and demonstrated an interest in realist art, shown in works like Sick girl. In his late years, Dobrovich painted portraits of Bulgarian National Revival figures Georgi Mirkovich, Georgi Rakovski, Vasil Levski and Hadzhi Dimitar. Upon returning to Bulgaria in 1893 he held an exhibition which included paintings and copies of paintings by Italian Baroque artists such as Guido Reni and Carlo Dolci. The Sliven Art Gallery is named the Dimitar Dobrovich Art Gallery in his honour. Besides the National Art Gallery of Bulgaria, the National Gallery of Greece also displays some of his works.

Background Haldor Johan Hanson was born in Fusa in the county of Hordaland near Bergen, Norway to Hans Lammenaes and Herborg (L√∏nningdahl). He emigrated with his family in 1865, at the age of nine, to Grand Mound, Iowa, where his parents farmed. Hanson enrolled at Luther College graduating in 1883. Hanson studied at the Music Conservatory of Chicago from 1883-1884. Career Hanson taught at Willmar Seminary (academy) in Willmar, Minnesota, 1885-1887, before returning to Luther College to teach music and mathematics from 1888-1890. Hanson served as principal of Decorah School of Music in 1889 which was incorporated into the Luther College the following year. Hanson left Luther in 1891 to studied music in Weimar, Germany from 1891-1892. Returning to Luther College in 1894, he was appointed as the first professor of music in 1895. He continued to serve on the faculty until 1904. Hanson served as organizer and conductor of the Luther College choirs from 1882-1883. He organized the Decorah Choral Union in 1889. In 1895 Hanson started the Luther College Musical Union. In October 1895, Hanson was placed in charge of the museum at Luther College where he served as Curator until 1902. Ultimately Hanson resigned his appointment at Luther in 1904 at least in part because of his disagreement with President College Christian Keyser Preus.

Among Hanson‚Äôs other activities was his service on the editorial staff of the Norwegian-American newspaper, Skandinaven. In 1904 he compiled an index to Maanedstidende and Kirketidende, the church paper for the Norwegian Synod. The first edition of an English-Norwegian-Danish dictionary compiled by Hanson was published in 1909 and reprinted in several subsequent editions. In 1916, he composed a Cantata for Christmas-tide and formulated the Norsk-Amerikansk Julebog in 1921. He also translated a poem by Henrik Ibsen titled Terje Vigen.Authors, Hanson, Haldor (Luther College.

They primarily live in the Indian states of West Bengal, Odisha, and Jharkhand, mostly in the old Singhbhum district. They speak Bhumij, which is considered by most to be a dialect of Mundari. They can also be found in Bangladesh. History Bhumij means \\"one who is born from the soil.\\" Herbert Hope Risley noted in 1890 that the Bhumij inhabit that tract of the country which lies on both sides of the Subarnarekha River. He claimed the eastern branch of Bhumij only spoke Bengali. According to him, they were a group of Munda who moved east and lost connection with other Mundas, and later adopted Hindu customs when non-tribals arrived in the area. While those living nearer to Chota Nagpur Plateau still retain linguistic links with Mundari, those living further east have adopted Bengali as their language. In Dhalbhum they are completely Hinduized. During British rule, or sometimes even earlier, many of the Bhumij became zamindars and some even secured the title of Raja. Others were called Sardar. However, all of them, having climbed the social ladder, proclaimed themselves to be Kshatriyas, in keeping with the trends in the region.Ghosh, Binoy, Paschim Banger Sanskriti, (in Bengali), part I, 1976 edition, pp. 423-434, Prakash Bhaban Rebellions An account by a Colonel Dalton claimed they were known as robbers (), and their various rebellions were called . The people in the surrounding areas were quite scared of them. In 1798, when the Puncheet estate was sold to pay taxes required of it by the East India Company, the Bhumij led a revolt against the British. The Bhumij revolt of 1832 is quite well-known. In this case, there was a disputed succession over the crown. The court decided the eldest son of the king, the son of the second wife instead of the son of the first wife (patrani), to be the king. Lakshman, the son of the patrani, opposed his brother, was arrested and died in jail. A younger son of the patrani, Madabh Sinh, was appointed diwan but became widely detested as a cheat who abused his position. Therefore, Ganganarayan attacked Madabh Sinh and killed him, and afterwards led a general uprising. The Britishers were forced to send in troops to quell the revolt, and pushed him into the hills. Ganganarayan fled to Singhbum, where he was asked by the Larkas to prove his loyalty if they would join his cause. Their condition was for him to attack a fort of Kharsawan ruled by a Thakur that claimed supremacy over the area. During the siege, Ganganarayan was killed, and his head was set to the Britishers by the Thakur.  Geographic distribution  The Bhumijs are found in Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha, Assam, and Bihar. They are concentrated in the districts of Midnapore, Purulia, Bankura and 24 Parganas in West Bengal. In Odisha, they are thickly concentrated in the districts of Mayurbhanj, Sundargarh, Keonjhar, and Balasore, and sporadically distributed in other parts. In Assam, where they are very recent immigrants, their greatest concentration occurs in the Assam valley. In Jharkhand, they are found in the districts of Singhbhum, Manbhum, Hazaribagh, Ranchi and Dhanbad. The Bhumij people came to the Sylhet region from Bihar as tea-labourers. They can be found in Srimangal with a population of 3000. They are divided into many clans such as Kaitra, Garur, Kasim, Bhugal, Baundra, Ban, Nag, Shona, Shar and Tresha. Their Bhumij dialect is less and less spoken and Bengali is more widely spoken among the community. Culture The Bhumijs of Manbhum believe that their original occupation was military service. Subsequently, agriculture was taken as the sole activity by all the tribes, except the iron- smelting Shelo. A few were engaged in petty trade, and some immigrated to the tea districts of Assam. In Jharkhand and Bihar, the Bhumij even today depend upon agriculture, fishing, hunting and forest produces. Thus, the Bhumijs who are mainly agriculturists also hunt and trap birds and animals in the jungles, and the landless among them work as labourers. Various seasonally available forest products are a subsidiary source of income for them. Marginal income from wage labour, minor non-forest products and animal husbandry are the main source of livelihood for the rural Bhumij. Rice is their staple food and is consumed throughout the year. They are non-vegetarians, but do not eat pork or beef. The Bhumijs also eat white-ants (termites) and insects. Drinks like rice beer and toddy are commonly consumed by them. Mahua liquor is used sumptuously during feasts and festivals. As regards dress and ornaments, they follow their Hindu neighbours. Children of both the sexes go naked till the age of four or five years and after which they wear a towel or trouser till adolescence. The male dress consists of a shirt, a dhoti or lungi, and a towel. The women wear sari and blouse. Young girls are fond of ornaments such as nose-rings, earrings, bead necklaces, armlets and bangles made of brass. They put on flowers in their hair. Social structure of the Bhumijs is characterised by nuclear family, patriliny, exogamy and hereditary headship of the village community. They follow Hindu practices of succession and inheritance. The Bhumijs are divided into several endogamous groups based on territory and occupation. In Mayurbhanj, the various Bhumijs are: Tamuriya Bhumij, Haldipukuri Bhumij, Teli Bhumij, Desi or indigenous 'Bhumij, Vada Bhuinyas and Kol Bhumij. Each group forms an exogamous group of its own and do not intermarry. Each one of these groups consists of a number of exogamous sub- groups called kili, the names of which are chosen from diverse sources representing fauna and flora, heavenly bodies, earth, etc. A Bhumij refrains from injuring anything represented by the name of the group. But there are no elaborate rituals in honour of clan totems. It may be that the exogamous groups were totemic, but with the progress of time and contact with their Hindu neighbours, the totemic system has turned into prohibitive marriage rules. Besides, lately they have developed a local grouping called the thaks, named after villages. Each of these thaks is also exogamous in the sense that a member of one thak cannot marry a member of the same village even if he or she belongs to a different sept. The rule of exogamy is so strict that a man may not marry a woman of his own sept, nor a woman who comes within the standard formula for reckoning prohibited degrees, calculated to three generations in the descending line, but sometimes extended to five where bhaiyadi or mutual recognition of kinship has been maintained between the families. In the early 1900s, no Bhumij followed child marriage unless they were from the more Sanskritized wealthy families. Brides would be given for an amount ranging from Rs 3 to Rs 12 (in the early 20th century). Usually the wedding would be at the bride's house, where a square space, called a marwa, would be created in a courtyard by dabbing it with rice-water. In the center mahua and sidha branches would be placed, bound with cowries and 5 pieces of turmeric. At the ends of the square were placed 4 earthen water-vessels, each half-filled with pulses and covered with a lamp. The pots were connected with a cotton thread marking the boundary of the marwa. On the bridegroom's arrival, he would be led to the marwa and sit on a board called a pira. The bride would then sit on his left-hand side, and a short introduction would be delivered by relatives. A priest, usually a Bengali Brahmin, would chant mantras, then the bride would light and blow out the lamps at the corners of the marwa 5 or 7 times, depending on the custom. The bride would then be \\"given\\" to the groom, and the priest would then join the couple's right hands. Finally, the groom applied kumkum to the bride's forehead and tied a knot that would remain intact for 3‚Äì10 days, after which they would rub themselves with turmeric, bathe, and untie the knot. Sex before marriage was not considered taboo, but it was understood that if the girl became pregnant she would marry the father of the child. The Bhumij recognise polygyny, barrenness of first wife is the main reason. Polyandry is unknown. Widows are allowed to remarry according to the sanga ritual in which all the ceremonies of a regular marriage are not performed. Remarriage often takes place between widowers and widows, though bachelors are not barred from such a union. However, in case of woman, levirate applies mainly to widows. In case of widow-marriage also, bride-price of lesser amount is given. Divorce is also allowed among the Bhumijs in extreme cases of adultery, and the divorced women may remarry according to the sanga rite. However, a woman has no right to divorce her husband, and if she is neglected or ill-treated, only remedy available to her is to run away with another man. Adultery within the community is generally condoned with a fine but adultery with a member of another tribe results in ostracization. At birth, a woman is attended by a midwife of the Ghasi community, and the umbilical cord is severed by her, and after birth it is put in a hole dug outside the hut. Birth-related pollution varies from 8 to 10 days, during which mother remains in the lying-in-room. After it, a Hindu washerman and barber are engaged to clean the clothes and shave and pare the nails. This is followed by naming ceremony. After death, the rich section of the Bhumijs generally cremates the bodies of adults, and the poor ones bury them due to cost of firewood. However, the children of both rich and poor are buried. The practice of burial or cremation and observance of death pollution vary a little from place to place. But mourning takes place generally for ten days after which the cleaning and shaving rituals are performed, followed by certain rituals and feast marks the last part of death rituals. At times even the charred bones are kept in an earthen pot and carried to the ancestral clan ossuary for burial. They also practice the martial art Firkal, although it has been reduced to a single village among the Bhumij who perform it. Religion and festivals The Bhumijs revere the sun under the name of Sing-Bonga and Dharam, both considered to be their supreme deities. They worship Jahuburu in the sacred grove of the village at the Sarhul festival in Baisakh (April‚ÄìMay) and Phalgun (February‚ÄìMarch). Karakata, a female deity, responsible for rains and bumper crops, Baghut or Bagh-Bhut, a male deity, responsible to ward off the animals and protect the crops in Kartik (October‚ÄìNovember), Gram-Deota and Deoshali, the village deities to ward off sickness and watch over supply of water for drinking and irrigation in Ashadh (July‚ÄìAugust), Buru, a mountain deity, for general prosperity in Magh, Panchbahini and Baradela, local deities of Bankura Bhumijs, etc., are worshipped by the Bhumijs. Manasa, a deity, presiding over snakes, is worshipped in Shravana (July‚ÄìAugust) for two or three days in the courtyards of Seraikela Bhumijs. The Bhumijs also worship Paori, a female deity, in Jaistha (May‚ÄìJune) and again in Asadh (June‚ÄìJuly) for timely rains and general welfare of the village. Asadhi puja is performed before ploughing and transplanting of paddy seedlings. They worship Jaharburi in Chaitra (March‚ÄìApril), associated with the better flowering of the sal tree and also better shooting out of sal leaves. Atra, a Goddess, for protection from smallpox is worshipped. Dhulla Puja is held in Baisakh (April‚ÄìMay) for the wellbeing of the village. Vadhna parab is held on the day of the new moon in Kartik (October‚ÄìNovember) before reaping, and Nua-Khia, the new rice-eating ceremony. The Bhumijs also celebrate Karam festival in Bhadra (August_September) for prosperity of the village. An unmarried male goes to the jungle and brings a branch of the Karam tree and plants near the house of the Dehuri or at any particular place meant for it. After a long spell of dance and music throughout the night, they immerse it in water on the next day. The community priest, variously known as Laya, Naya or Dehuri, is from their own tribe rather than a Brahmin, and he solely conducts all the rituals and ceremonies for all deities. As the Naya is a communal servant of the village, all its inhabitants have equal claims on his services. For his services he receives a few plots of rent-free land and the heads of sacrificed animals in the communal religious rites. For this, in addition to performance of religious rituals, he makes certain sacrifices like avoiding certain food and observing fast on certain occasions. The office of Naya is generally hereditary. The whole community gets involved in any social or religious celebration. People dance to the tune of a madal (drum) and sing religious and romantic songs depending on the occasion. Community feast and intoxicating drinks provide the Bhumijs the desired amusement. The institutions of soya and phul among the Bhumijs of Manbhum help in establishing ceremonial friendship with people of other communities. Thus, the Bhumijs have a good sense of community feeling and they maintain equilibrium and peaceful coexistence. However, by the turn of the 20th century, Hinduism had begun to change many of their local customs. The followers of Sarnaism among the Bhumij have been organising protests and petitions to have their religion recognised by the government of India in census forms.SANTOSH K. KIRO.

Filmed in 1985, Romand's Mix-Up ou M√©li-M√©lo attained success in the United States after it was discovered by Vincent Canby of the New York Times. Vincent Canby on Mix-Up (New York Times, 07/24/1987) Journalist Jonathan Rosenbaum, of the Chicago Reader, selected it as the top film among his 10 best films of 1988 and among his 15 best films of the 1980s. The Best Films by Jonathan Rosenbaum (Chicago Reader) Romand's other films include Appelez-moi Madame (Call Me Madame) (1986), Th√®me Je (The Camera I) (2004), Baiser d'encre (Ink Kiss) (2015). Biography Fran√ßoise Romand studied cinema at IDHEC (1974). In 1987, she received a Villa M√©dicis Hors Les Murs in the USA and received a retrospective at the Film Center Art Institute at the Museum of Chicago in 1995. From Mix-up ou M√©li-m√©lo to Th√®me Je (The Camera I), Robert Koehler on Th√®me Je (The Camera I) (Variety, 09/28/2004) she invented a new form of documentary which blends humor and fiction. In 2000, after filming characters with peculiar life stories, Romand turned the camera on herself. Her subjects have included switched babies in Mix-Up, Jean-Philippe Tess√© on DVD Mix-Up (Les Cahiers du Cin√©ma, Dec.2006) and on DVD Mix-Up plus Call Me Madame (Chronic'art, Nov.2008) a communist poet becoming a woman with the help of his wife in Call Me Madame, Jenny Ulrich on DVD Call Me Madame (Arte.tv, Oct.2008) Anita B. on Call Me Madame (Fluctuat.net, 11/24/1008) the old twins of The Crumbs of Purgatory still living with their parents, the exchange of the lives of two heroines of Vice Vertu et Vice Versa', and amnesia in Passe-Compose. The Camera I echoes all these stories. Romand dissects family secrets, drags skeletons out of the closet, aims the camera on her lovers who hold mirrors up to her, with unflinching humor. She directs herself, mixing as always fiction and documentary. She believes that cinema is an art of illusion, that truth is a trap and that people shot on the fly are only phantoms. Digital cinema allows her to shoot outside of traditional production methods. The director had to sell her apartment after her year teaching at Harvard.Adam Hart (2005), An Interview with Fran√ßoise Romand, Conversations with Filmmakers, Issue 35,Senses of Cinema. Retrieved from: http://sensesofcinema.com/2005/conversations-with-filmmakers/francoise_romand/ Cin√©-Romand Charlotte Garson on Cin√©-Romand and DVD Call Me Madame (Les Cahiers du Cin√©ma, Nov.2008) Antonio Fischetti on Cin√©-Romand and St√©phane Bou on Call Me Madame (Charlie Hebdo, Dec.2008) which came out in 2009, is a mise- en-abyme of her previous films. Spectators were invited to discover themselves at a happening that mixes fiction and reality as domestic theater. Voyeurs are not always who we think they are. Romand takes her inspiration from L‚ÄôArroseur Arros√© (The Sprinkler Sprinkled), continuing the role of her great-grandfather from La Ciotat, the playful kid who bent the hose to stop the water. After filming the spectators and tenants of the apartments in which the documentary scenes were improvised, Fran√ßoise Romand integrated them fictionally into excerpts from previous films and it was reworked in the editing. Guests, spectators, hosts, angels-guides, actors and technicians - all become characters in this fiction documentary where Alice's looking glass reflects a mischievous fantasy where the roles were reversed and complemented one another. She loves to work on sound with composers such as Nicolas Frize, Bruno Coulais, Jean-Jacques Birg√©, as much as on images. In 2020 Fran√ßoise Romand was awarded the Prix Charles Brabant (SCAM) for her career. Prix Charles Brabant (SCAM) pour l'ensemble de son ≈ìuvre.

Hermann in 1847. During the analysis of the mineral samarskite, he concluded that it does contain an element similar to niobium and tantalum. The similar reactivity of niobium and tantalum complicated preparation of pure samples of the metals and therefore several new elements were proposed, which were later found to be mixtures of niobium and tantalum. The differences between tantalum and niobium, and the fact that no other similar element was present, were unequivocally demonstrated in 1864 by Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand, and Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville, as well as Louis J. Troost, who determined the formulas of some of the compounds in 1865 and finally by the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac Although it had been proven that ilmenium is only a mixture of niobium and tantalum, Hermann continued publishing articles on ilmenium for several years.

Taxonomy and systematics Formerly, this species was lumped with the broad-billed fairywren in the genus Malurus until a 2011 analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA showed high divergence between the two subspecies resulting in them being re-split into separate species. The study also found them to lie in a clade with the genera Sipodotus and Clytomyias leading to their subsequent re-classification in their own genus, Chenorhamphus.

Many EHCs cover the properties of individual chemicals or of groups of related chemicals (see, e.g., EHC 65: Butanols).. Since 1998, this role has mostly been taken over by the related Concise International Chemical Assessment Documents (CICADs), also prepared by the IPCS and published by the WHO.

EHCs are based on a search of the scientific literature, and do not include new experimentation (unlike, e.g., SIDS or EU-RARs) although they may contain recommendations for further studies. A typical monograph on a chemical substance would include: *the physical and chemical properties of the substance and analytical methods for determining concentrations and exposure; *sources of environmental and industrial exposure and environmental transport; *chemobiokinetics and metabolism including absorption, distribution, transformation and elimination; *short- and long-term effects on animals, including carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and teratogenicity; *an evaluation of risks for human health and of the effects on the environment.

Its mission is to serve fans by preserving and encouraging transformative fan activity, known as \\"fanwork\\", and by making fanwork widely accessible. OTW advocates for the transformative, legal, and legitimate nature of fan labor activities, including fan fiction, fan videos, fan art, anime music videos, podfic (audio recordings of fan fiction), and real person fiction. Its vision is to nurture fans and fan culture, and to protect fans' transformative work from legal snafus and commercial exploitation. The Organization for Transformative Works offers the following services and platforms to fans in a myriad of fandoms: * Archive of Our Own (AO3): An open- source, non-commercial, non-profit, multi-fandom web archive built by fans for hosting fan fiction and for embedding other fanwork, including fan art, fan videos, and podfic. * Fanlore: A wiki for fans from a wide range of communities whose published mission is to provide a platform \\"to record and share their histories, experiences and traditions\\" in fandom and fanwork history. * Open Doors: Preservation of fannish historical artifacts, such as zines and Geocities websites, as well as transferring fanfiction to Archive of Our Own from other websites when they shut down. * Transformative Works and Cultures: A peer-reviewed academic journal for scholarship on fanworks and practices * Legal advocacy to the fandom community, addressing the legal issues with fan fiction and other fan works, including defending fans' fair use of copyrighted material. * Vidding (2008): a series of six short documentaries on vidding, in combination with participatory-culture academic Henry Jenkins and the New Media Literacies project at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. * Fanhackers: A directory of information and resources to help fans, academics, and activists, including good metadata (information, analysis, and discussion about data). Legal activism The OTW provides legal assistance to the fandom community, addressing the legal issues with fan fiction and other fan works. Rebecca Tushnet, a noted legal scholar on fanfiction and fair use in copyright and trademark law, works with the OTW's legal project. In 2008, the OTW (in coordination with the Electronic Frontier Foundation) successfully submitted requests to the Library of Congress for further exceptions to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to allow the fair use of video clips for certain noncommercial uses such as video remixes, commentary, and education, as well as to protect technology used for such purposes. The exceptions were also successfully renewed in 2012 and expanded in 2015. The OTW, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and New Media Rights submitted a new petition for exemptions in 2018. The OTW has also submitted several amicus briefs to the courts in several cases involving intellectual property law: * In Fox vs. Dish, the OTW (in coalition with the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Public Knowledge) submitted an amicus brief which argued in defense of digital recording methods used by Dish Network, claiming that \\"The popular fanwork genre of noncommercial videos (\\"vids\\") uses clips from television shows or film, reworking them in a way that comments on or critiques the original. The Copyright Office has held that substantial numbers of vids constitute fair uses. But the creation of fan vids requires intermediate digital copying and processing in order to produce the transformative final product. OTW thus believes that intermediate copying performed to facilitate fair use constitutes fair use.\\" * In the case of Ryan Hart vs. Electronic Arts, the OTW (in combination with the Digital Media Law Project and the International Documentary Association) submitted a brief arguing that Electronic Arts's use of factual information (such as the height, weight, and jersey number of football players) in creative works (in this case, video games) is protected by the First Amendment. Fandom archival projects The OTW has also instituted several projects for preserving fan history and culture. One such project was the creation of Fanlore, a wiki for preserving fandom history. The Fanlore wiki was first revealed in beta in 2008, with a full release in December 2010. As of June 2018, there are approximately 45,000 articles and 800,000 edits to the wiki. The OTW also has several \\"Open Doors\\" projects dedicated to the preservation of fannish historical artifacts. These projects include The Fan Culture Preservation Project, a joint venture between the OTW and the Special Collections department at the University of Iowa to archive and preserve fanzines and other non-digital forms of fan culture, and The GeoCities Rescue Project, which attempted to preserve content originally hosted on Yahoo's GeoCities by transferring that content to new locations on the Archive of Our Own or within the Fanlore wiki. Other miscellaneous artifacts and collections are stored on the OTW's main servers in the Special Collections gallery. Archive of Our Own Created by the OTW, the Archive of Our Own (AO3) is an open-source, non- commercial, non-profit archive for fan fiction and other transformative fanwork. The Archive is built and run entirely by volunteers, many without previous coding experience. The Archive was publicly launched into open beta on 14 November 2009, and has been growing steadily since. Time magazine included Archive of Our Own on its list of \\"50 Best Websites 2013\\". Time said that AO3 \\"serves all fandoms equally, from The A-Team to Zachary Quinto and beyond\\", and also called it \\"the most carefully curated, sanely organized, easily browsable and searchable nonprofit collection of fan fiction on the Web...\\". Fans post, tag and categorize their own works on AO3. Volunteer \\"tag wranglers\\" link similar tags so readers can search for works in the categories and types they want. The tagging system allows easy compilation of statistics (stats). Fan fiction ranges in length, from fewer than one thousand words (flash fiction, or one-hundred-word drabbles) to novel-length works of hundreds of thousands of words. According to an article on fandom statistics published on The Daily Dot newspaper in 2013, AO3 hosts more very short works than long ones, but readers prefer the longer works. The average very short story received fewer than 150 hits, while novel-length works are more likely to receive around 1,500 hits. A writer who posts a story on AO3 can record its word count on the story's header, along with other information such as the story's fandom, romantic pairings, and other tropes. Some fan works are 'crossovers' that draw on two or more universes or characters. Writers can also note if their story is finished or a work in progress (WIP). As of 2018, the archive hosts more than 4.2 million works in more than 30,000 fandoms. Destination Toast, fan and statistician, compiles and analyzes fandom statistics, especially stats from Archive of Our Own, which she says is \\"the most easily searchable archive I know of.\\" In January 2016, she posted \\"2015: A (Statistical) Year in Fandom.\\" It includes statistics from two other large fan fiction archives, FanFiction.Net (FFN) and Wattpad as well as the popular microblog platform Tumblr. The post shows that the most active fandoms on AO3 in 2015 were (largest first) Supernatural, Dragon Age, Harry Potter, The Avengers, Teen Wolf, and Sherlock. Other media sources include movies, television shows, and books including Lord of the Rings, Doctor Who, and The Hunger Games.

He belonged to a dynasty of kings who were descended from Majapahit on Java, and reigned from their palace (puri) in Gelgel. Intrigues and rebellions The main source for his reign is the Babad Dalem, a chronicle from the 18th century.I Wayan Warna et al. (tr.), Babad Dalem. Teks dan Terjemahan. Denpasar: Dinas Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan Daerah Tingkat I Bali 1986. He was the son of the successful king Dalem Baturenggong, and came to the throne when still a minor. His uncle Dewa Anggungan wished to usurp kingship, and was supported by the nobleman Batan Jeruk who took Dalem Bekung and his brother Seganing into custody. He was immediately opposed by the majority of the grandees of the kingdom and the two infant princes were rescued. Batan Jeruk fled and was killed by loyalist soldiers. His kinsmen later founded the Karangasem kingdom in East Bali. Dewa Anggungan was spared but lost his caste status as Ksatria. The Batan Jeruk rebellion is dated in 1556 or 1558 in Balinese texts. When old enough to reign in his own name, Dalem Bekung proved to be an inactive and cowardly ruler, which led to a loss of royal prestige and discipline among the grandees. He left the affairs of state to his chief minister Nginte. In this period the famous Brahmin sage Nirartha, who had entertained a profound impact on the religious elite culture on Bali, died. A conflict between the noblemen Kiyayi Pande and Gusti Talabah escalated into a full-scale rebellion where Kiyayi Pande mounted a desperate attack on the troops of the king. In the end he was defeated and killed with utmost effort, an event dated in 1578 by various texts. After this event Dalem Bekung had to leave the Gelgel palace. Late versions of the Babad Dalem assert that his brother Dalem Seganing took over as king in his stead at this point.I B. Rai Putra, Babad Dalem. Denpasar: Upada Sastra 1991, p. 59. Defeat by the Javanese Towards the end of Dalem Bekung's life, a military expedition was organized to support the East Javanese kingdom of Blambangan against Pasuruan, a port and kingdom on the north coast of Java. The expedition, which was led by the nobleman Jelantik, sailed to Panarukan in East Java, and marched into the land of Pasuruan. However, it met with a shattering defeat and Jelantik was killed. Some time after this calamity, Dalem Bekung died. His name is in fact a nickname, meaning 'the childless'. His brother Dalem Seganing either took the throne or continued to reign.C.C. Berg, De middeljavaansche historische traditi√´. Santpoort: Mees 1927, pp. 144-54. When the first Dutch expedition, under Cornelis de Houtman, visited Bali in 1597, they met a king who might have been either Dalem Bekung or Dalem Seganing. The king was described as a heavily built, stout man of about 40‚Äì50 years. The Dutchmen provided lively accounts of the royal splendours they saw on Bali, which accord rather well with the descriptions in the later Balinese chronicles.W.A. Hanna, Bali Chronicles. Singapore: Periplus 2004, pp. 32-7. At the time of their visit, a large Balinese expedition was prepared in order to assist the still Hindu kingdom of Blambangan against the Muslim Pasuruan. A later Dutch account indicates that the expedition was fruitless, since Blambangan fell to Pasuruan in c. 1597. It has been argued that this must be the Jelantik expedition mentioned in the Babad Dalem. Another hypothesis places Dalem Bekung's reign much later, in the 1630s.H.

Whitlam offered the post of Ambassador to Ireland to a non-government senator from Queensland, Vince Gair, in the hope that this would improve Labor's chance of gaining a majority in the Senate at the forthcoming general election. Whitlam's plan was foiled by the Premier of Queensland, Joh Bjelke-Petersen, during what came to be known as \\"The Night of the Long Prawns\\", but the matter was overtaken by events when Whitlam decided to call a double dissolution election. Jenny Hocking has said of the affair: \\"The government's attempts to effect an additional Senate vacancy through Gair's resignation was constitutionally sound, strategically brilliant and an unmitigated political disaster.\\" Background At the 1972 election, Gough Whitlam led the Australian Labor Party to its first success at the federal level in 23 years. Although another election for the House of Representatives was not due until early 1976, an election for half the Senate was required earlier. Normally, these elections are held on the same day, but they had become out of synchronisation in 1963 due to the then Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies calling an early House election. Between 1963 and 1972, elections for the Senate and House of Representatives were held separately. The last half-Senate election was held on 21 November 1970, senators' terms commencing on 1 July 1971. Another half- Senate election had to be held in time for senators to commence their terms on 1 July 1974. Such an election could have been called for any time from early August 1973, but Whitlam was in no hurry. Although Labor controlled the House of Representatives with a 9-seat majority, it was 5 seats short of a majority in the Senate. Consequently, Labor faced constant opposition in getting its legislation through the parliament. By March 1974, a number of bills had been twice rejected by the Senate, which gave Whitlam the capacity to call a double dissolution, in which the entire parliament would be up for election. If the government were returned, it could reintroduce the bills in question, and if they were rejected by the Senate a third time, the government could seek to hold a joint sitting of the Senate and House. In either event, a double dissolution would bring House and Senate elections back in synchronisation with each other. In early March 1974, however, such a course of action was not under active consideration. It was an option that had only ever been used twice before (in 1914, when the government was defeated; and 1951, when the government was returned with a reduced majority in the lower house, albeit now with a majority in the Senate) and was regarded as somewhat extreme. Also, Labor felt it needed more time to improve its electoral stocks before considering such a move. Whitlam still only intended to call a half-Senate election, even though this would continue the lack of synchronicity between the elections of the houses, something he had often deplored. In debates in parliament and in outside commentary, he often decried the fact that senators elected in 1967 and 1970 were able to frustrate the will of a government elected in 1972. Vince Gair Vincent Clair Gair was a former Australian Labor Party (ALP) Premier of Queensland 1952-57 who was expelled from his own party while in office, and formed the breakaway Queensland Labor Party (QLP), which in 1962 merged with the Democratic Labor Party (DLP). In 1964 he was elected to federal parliament as a DLP Senator for Queensland, his term commencing on 1 July 1965. He was elected parliamentary leader of the DLP immediately although it had only two members at that time (Frank McManus from Victoria was the other). He was re-elected in 1970 for a new term (1971‚Äì1977). In 1973, by which time the DLP's Senate numbers had risen to five, internal issues caused Gair to resign as leader of the party from 10 October, with McManus taking over.Senate Hansard, 10 October 1973 He had first intimated in January 1973 that he would resign as leader, but vacillated until October, when Frank McManus offered him the choice of immediate resignation or being removed by his colleagues.Biographical Directory of the Australian Senate: Vincent Gair Gair announced at that time that his current term as senator would be his last. In March 1974 he also complained to the Labor senator Justin O'Byrne that the DLP had treated him shabbily. He said he was thinking of leaving the Senate earlier than 1977, and suggested that he would consider accepting a diplomatic post should the government be minded to offer him one. O'Byrne repeated this conversation to his Senate Leader Lionel Murphy, who devised a plan to use Gair's disgruntlement to Labor's advantage, which he talked over with Whitlam. The plan was to appoint Gair to an overseas post, which would require him to resign his seat in the Senate, and to arrange for this to occur before the writs for the impending half-Senate election were issued. This would have the effect of causing writs to be issued for the election of 6 senators from Queensland, not the 5 as would otherwise have been the case (at that time, each state had 10 senators, and 5 of them were elected at each half-Senate election). Gair was not the only non-Labor person in Labor's sights: they also offered the post of Ambassador to the Holy See to Frank McManus (he refused outright); and they had been considering offering Liberal senator Peter Durack a seat on the High Court, but never approached him. This plan also relied on a feature of the Constitution at that time, which was amended in 1977. In 1973, a casual Senate vacancy was filled by an appointment made by the relevant state parliament (as is still the case), but under Section 15, the appointed senator's term came to an end on the day before the next election for either the Senate or the House of Representatives, or both. (Since 1977, a replacement senator continues for the remainder of the original senator's term.) In a normal half-Senate election, Labor could expect to win 2 of the 5 seats in Queensland. However, if 6 seats were up for election, Labor could expect to win 3, and this would give it the bare majority it needed in the Senate to guarantee passage of future legislation. Gair was offered the post of Ambassador to the Republic of Ireland, and readily accepted on 13 March 1974. Ireland was dear to his heart, as his mother was Irish, his wife was of Irish stock, and he was a staunch Catholic, and he saw this as a particularly fitting way to conclude his public life. However, the matter needed to remain strictly confidential pending various matters of protocol being attended to. The Federal Executive Council approved the appointment on 14 March, and the Irish Government accepted the appointment on 19 March. It cabled its approval to Canberra, where it was received on 20 March. On 21 March, Gough Whitlam advised the Parliament that he had obtained the concurrence of the Governor-General, Sir Paul Hasluck, to hold a half-Senate election on 18 May 1974, and the timing of the issue of the writs was a matter of discussion between the Governor-General and the state governors. Labor's plan was that Gair would tender his resignation to the President of the Senate, Sir Magnus Cormack, on 2 April, when the Senate returned after a break, well before the writs were expected to be issued for the election, but for it remain a strictly confidential matter until then. The Night of the Long Prawns On the morning of 2 April, The Sun News- Pictorial newspaper broke the news of Gair's appointment to Ireland. In Parliament, the Leader of the Opposition, Billy Snedden, asked Prime Minister Whitlam to come clean. He readily confirmed the appointment. Snedden decried it as shameful and \\"worse than any Tammany Hall effort that has ever been made in the United States\\", and compared it with what he called the \\"very fine appointment\\" of Sir Garfield Barwick as Chief Justice of the High Court.House of Representatives Hansard, 2 April 1974 The Leader of the National Country Party (NCP), Doug Anthony, denounced the appointment as a cynical buying-off exercise. He was aware that the timing was crucial, and he phoned the NCP Premier of Queensland, Joh Bjelke-Petersen, urging him to have the writs for the Queensland Senate seats issued immediately, before Gair had a chance to see Cormack and resign. Senator Ian Wood also contacted Bjelke-Petersen along similar lines.Biographical Dictionary of the Australian Senate: Ian Wood But Gair had to be kept at bay while the Governor of Queensland, Sir Colin Hannah, was consulted about the matter, as it was his sole prerogative under the Constitution to issue writs for Senate elections, albeit always acting on advice from the premier of the day. NCP Queensland Senator Ron Maunsell entertained Vince Gair and other senators in his office, plying him with drinks and prawns he regularly brought all the way from his home in Townsville. Ian Wood also had a hand in arranging this; he was a teetotaller, but had no scruples about arranging for others to use alcohol to further his political goals. But Gair also had to appear in the Senate chamber and vote where necessary; the Opposition was aware the government would likely claim he had effectively resigned in March when his appointment as Ambassador was approved, as this was an office of profit under the crown, which serving members and senators are prohibited from accepting on pain of forfeiture of their parliamentary seats. If Gair was appearing in parliament right up till 2 April, with no objections from the government, the Opposition reasoned that the government could hardly credibly hold to the line that he had ceased to be a senator in March, or at any time before the issue of the writs for Queensland. So Maunsell stayed close to Gair the whole evening, shepherded him into the Senate chamber for a vote on the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill,Biographical Dictionary of the Australian Senate: Ron Maunsell and then straight back to his office for more whisky and prawns. In fact, he did not need to do this, since the electoral legislation deems writs to be issued at 6 pm regardless of the time they are actually issued. As long as Gair was prevented from seeing the President until 6 pm, the plan would work. Maunsell later made a personal explanation to the Senate, in which he denied exerting any undue influence on Gair; he explained that the Parliamentary Dining Rooms had gone on strike in the morning, Gair had not eaten all day, Maunsell was simply extending courtesy to a fellow Queensland senator, and Gair was free at all times to come and go as he pleased. The Senate sat through until 12:30 am on the morning of 3 April, and Gair did not finally leave for home until around 3 am. About 90 minutes earlier, at 1:40 am, Bjelke-Petersen announced to the Queensland Parliament that the Governor had, on his recommendation, issued writs for the election of five senators at 11 pm on 2 April. Labor had been stymied, and the evening of 2‚Äì3 April 1974 has been known ever since in Australian political discourse as \\"The Night of the Long Prawns\\" thanks to a newspaper headline in The Australian of 4 April, to an article written by Bob Baudino. On 3 April, Vince Gair was expelled from the party of which he had been leader until just over four months earlier. At this time he said to his erstwhile DLP colleagues, \\"I've carried you bastards for years, and now you can all go to buggery!\\"Jenny Hocking: Gough Whitlam - His Time Gair's letter In the afternoon of 3 April, Gair was finally able to have his formal advice about his status conveyed to Sir Magnus Cormack through the Clerk of the Senate. However, it was not so much a letter of resignation, as a letter advising of his constitutional ineligibility to remain a senator due to his acceptance of the ambassadorship - the very argument that the Opposition had foreseen. The letter had been prepared by the Government and edited by Gair, and it said: > Dear Mr President, > I publicly announced yesterday that I had accepted appointment as > Australian Ambassador to the Republic of Ireland. I endeavoured to > communicate this to you personally yesterday and to inform you of my > position, but regrettably you were unavailable when I sought to see you. > My appointment was approved by the Governor-General on 14 March 1974, with > my knowledge and consent. I was informed on 20 March that the Government of > Ireland had communicated its agreement to my appointment. > As you are aware, the position of Ambassador is an office of profit under > the Crown and also carries with it fees for services rendered to the > Commonwealth, within the meaning of Section 45 of the Constitution, which I > had agreed to take. > The effect of my appointment as Ambassador was to vacate my place as a > Senator by virtue of the Constitution. > It is with regret that I decided after receiving the offer to leave the > Senate and the many friends I made during my nine years here. I would like > to personally thank you for our association in that period first as Senate > colleagues and later under your Presidency. > Yours faithfully > V.C.Gair The Senate President was unsure whether this letter amounted to a resignation; or whether Gair's seat had become vacant at all; and if it did, from when - so he put the question to the Senate for their consideration.Biographical Directory of the Australian Senate: Sir Magnus Cormack Labor argued that Gair had ceased to be a senator on either 14 March (when the Executive Council approved the ambassadorship) or 20 March (when the Irish Government accepted his appointment), but in any case well before the issue of the writs on 2 April. Opposition senators questioned why the Government did not alert the Senate to the presence of a stranger in its midst as soon as the appointment became effective, if that was its position. Senator Lionel Murphy deflected all such criticisms on the basis that it was a matter for Senator Gair to initiate the appropriate communications about his status to the President, which he did at the earliest opportunity. Turgid and legalistic discussion on the matter occupied much of the Senate's time on 3, 4, 8, 9 and 10 April 1974, without any resolution. Murphy arranged for a legal opinion supporting the government's position to be provided by the Solicitor-General of Australia, Maurice Byers, which was read out to the Senate. The matter was also extensively canvassed in the House of Representatives during this period. Double dissolution and aftermath In the evening of 10 April the whole matter became academic when Gough Whitlam advised the House of Representatives that Governor-General Hasluck had agreed to a double dissolution, the election for both houses to be held on the already announced date of 18 May 1974. The Parliament was dissolved on 11 April. In his valedictory remarks, Sir Magnus Cormack described it as the most turbulent Senate since Federation. According to the official record of the Senate, Vince Gair remained a senator until 11 April 1974, at which time he retired. At the election, all five Senate seats held by the DLP were lost, and that was the effective end of the party as a viable force in Australian politics. The party was wound up in 1978. The Labor Party was returned with a reduced majority of five in the lower house, and it remained without a majority in the Senate. The six twice-rejected bills were introduced again, and rejected a third time, but they were all finally passed at the historic joint sitting in August. One of the bills was subsequently struck down on procedural grounds.

Plot Bent on revenge for the death of his father and the theft of their ranch, young Bill Walton rides into town seeking the aid of his uncle. As he rides into town, he takes a bullet meant for gambler Matt Daggett and across the street lies his uncle, victim of the gambler's gun. Dagget looks on Bill as 'good luck' and nurses him back to health and gives him the job of training \\"Blue Chip\\", the fastest quarter horse in the west, for a big race. Bill doesn't know that Dagget plans to fix the race and put his own money on another horse at heavy odds. Quartered at the nearby ranch of John Grant, Bill meets Jerri Marshall, daughter of Bob Marshall, who lost \\"Blue Chip\\" to Daggett in a crooked gambling deal. Grant gets mixed up in a stage coach robbery and killing and rides back to the ranch with Daggett henchman Red Roper. When Roper tries to molest a woman, Bill bluffs him with an empty gun and forces him back to town. Roper is arrested for the killing and implicates Grant. Incited by Daggett, who fears exposure as the outlaw leader, a paid mob breaks into the jail and both Grant and Roper are hanged, but Grant, barely able to touch a plank with the toe of his boot, clings to life until Bill finds him and cuts him down. On the day of the race, Daggett lures Bill away from \\"Blue Chip\\" long enough for a wire to be twisted around the horse's leg at the fetlock. \\"Blue Chip\\" goes lane partly through the race but races on in agony and wins. Daggett tries to hide his treachery by blaming the lameness on a broken leg and draws his gun to shoot the horse. Marshall intervenes and is shot by the gambler.

Tom assures her that she will love them once she is able to hold them in her arms. At Lynette's request, the couple conceals the pregnancy from their family and friends.

Plot Angie and Nick start questioning Danny on where he went after the wedding and he tells them he went out drinking. Lynette is keeping her pregnancy secret from the kids. Katherine tells Orson that Mike and Susan's marriage will not last because Mike only feels sorry for Susan, and that he will come back to her. Bree and Karl have sex. Mrs. McCluskey has acquired a boyfriend, Roy. One day they are strolling on the sidewalk and she tells him she loves him. Just as he is about to respond, he sees Julie Mayer lying in a bunch of bushes. Everyone tries to figure out who would attack Julie. Karen and Carlos both turn to look at Danny, who is watching from his door step. Carlos thinks it is odd that the Bolens are not outside like the rest of them, Orson then says that they were outside but only for a minute. Carlos reveals that he saw Danny and Julie coming out of a movie theater so they think it is best to get to know them better. Angie and Nick confront Danny about where he was when Julie was strangled, Danny says he has nothing to do with that and he likes Julie. He said he maybe was in the park, he doesn't really remember because he drank a lot and it was very fuzzy, Nick tells Danny that he couldn't have been there because he drove by the park and he didn't see him there. Angie decides that they need to start making friends with the neighbors. Karen is debating on whether she should tell the police that she saw Julie and Danny fighting. Tom, Orson, and Carlos tell Nick they are going to start up a neighborhood watch then question him on Danny's relationship with Julie. Meanwhile, at the hospital it is made clear that Julie will not die, but she will be unconscious for some weeks. The doctor is about to give her an X-ray, and Lynette says he can't because she's pregnant. The other day Lynette and Julie had a talk and Julie thinks she's pregnant, but isn't sure.

Susan is happy that Lynette is pregnant, but wonders why she was crying. Lynette tells Susan that she doesn't want this pregnancy, with her working and Tom in school, and reveals she's been considering abortion, but Susan talks her out of it, telling Lynette that children are a gift, and that she has been so lucky after nearly losing her children (MJ in the car crash and Julie at the hands of a strangler). It is enough to change Lynette's mind about aborting her pregnancy. When Bree and Karl start to kiss, they are surprised to see Julie staring at them. Bree asks the doctor if Julie will remember what she saw when she was briefly awake and he tells her she most likely will. Susan tells Bree that if a friend knew about what Karl did to her and still slept with him then she would never speak to her again. Karl decides that he does not want to spend the night alone and wants her to join him in the motel room so she takes the room key as she does not want to be alone either. Detectives question Ana about her whereabouts at the time Julie was attacked and she reveals that she sneaked out to go drinking with Danny.

He was the leader of a failed putsch in 1931. Early years The son of a wine merchant, Pfrimer studied law at the University of Graz, gaining his doctorate in 1906.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Simon & Schuster, 1990 p. 294 As a student he had been a member of the Burschenschaft and an ardent follower of the German nationalist and antisemitic hard-liner Georg Ritter von Sch√∂nerer before settling into a position as a lawyer in Judenburg.F. L. Carsten, The Rise of Fascism, 1982, p. 223 He became a Heimwehr leader early in the movement's life and initially won the financial backing of the Alpine Montangesellschaft, the largest heavy industry concern in Austria.John T. Lauridsen, Nazism and the Radical Right in Austria, 1918-1934, 2007, p. 119 His Heimwehr unit was amongst the best armed, having received weapons from both Bavarian Georg Escherich rightist paramilitary leader and the local Landeshauptmann Anton Rintelen. Political views Pfrimer advocated Pan-Germanist and V√∂lkische ideals and used the swastika for his Heimwehr units. Like his sometime ally Richard Steidle in Tyrol he unashamedly endorsed fascism for the Heimwehr, unlike other units that were close to the more ideologically pragmatic Christian Social Party,Philip Morgan, Fascism in Europe'p. 63', 2003, p. 34 and in 1930 publicly advocated the overthrow of the government and the establishment of a fascist regime in Austria.Paul Hayes, Fascism, London: Allen & Unwin, 1973, p. 62 The two fell out however after Pfrimer, who argued that Jews must be treated as a foreign race, suggested that Steidle was too weak on the issue.Bruce F. Pauley, From Prejudice to Persecution: A History of Austrian Anti-Semitism, p. 177 Pfrimer took up with Ernst R√ºdiger Starhemberg and helped to ensure that the nobleman replaced Steidle as Heimwehr leader in 1930.F.L. Carsten, The Rise of Fascism, London: Methuen & Co, 1974, p. 226 He was also a staunch opponent of socialism, often leading his men in violent attacks on the Social Democratic Party of Austria, whilst rejecting parliamentary democracy as un-German. Putsch As head of the Heimwehr in Styria he attempted a putsch in 1931, initially in his own region. After rising up in Styria his units launched a marcia su Wien in a direct copy of Benito Mussolini's March on Rome but it proved to be a disaster and Pfrimer became mockingly known as the \\"half-day dictator\\" in reference to how long it took to put his attempted rebellion down.Iv√°n T. Berend, Decades of Crisis: Central and Eastern Europe before World War II, 2001, p. 302 He failed to gain support from the other regional leaders and indeed the coup was so poorly organised that it was easily put down by the otherwise weak government of Karl Buresch.Barbara Jelavich, Modern Austria: Empire and Republic, 1815-1986, 1987, p. 189 Aftermath Pfrimer was damaged irreparably by the fiasco of putsch. The failure also represented a further blow to the credibility of the Heimwehr, which lost more members to the Nazi Party as a consequence.R.J.B. Bosworth, The Oxford Handbook of Fascism, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 443 He fled to Yugoslavia before returning to face a treason trial but in a surprise move he was acquitted of all charges. Finally in 1933 Pfrimer allied himself and his units to the Nazis and before long his group had been absorbed entirely and he became a strong advocate of Anschluss.Pauley, From Prejudice to Persecution, p. 179 His membership of the Nazi Party was made official on 24 February 1933. When the Anschluss for which he had longed was completed in 1938 he returned to some prominence and sat as a member of the Reichstag. After the Allies liberated Austria Pfrimer was taken prisoner by the British forces and held in internment for a year.Rees, Biographical Dictionary, p. 295 Following his release he returned to his legal practice in Judenburg and lived out his days as a private citizen.

The Smiling, Proud Wanderer (Á¨ëÂÇ≤Ê±üÊπñ). Ming Pao, 1967. by Jin Yong (Louis Cha). The five sects specialise in swordplay and are based on the Five Great Mountains in Taoism: Mount Hua (ËèØÂ±±); Mount Tai (Ê≥∞Â±±); (South) Mount Heng (Ë°°Â±±); (North) Mount Heng (ÊÅÜÂ±±); and Mount Song (Âµ©Â±±)). The alliance's goal is to counter the 'unorthodox' Sun Moon Holy Cult (Êó•ÊúàÁ•ûÊïô); however, because of the members' distrusts and ulterior motives, the alliance is ultimately dissolute. Mount Hua Sect Mount Song Sect The Mount Song Sect (Âµ©Â±±Ê¥æ) is headed by Zuo Lengshan, who leads the alliance. It is based on the same mountain as the Shaolin Sect but is situated on a different peak. The ambitious and ruthless Zuo wishes to consolidate power by intimidating the other four sects to submit to him. He sends his spy Lao Denuo to infiltrate the Mount Hua Sect and steal Yue Buqun's 'Violet Mist Divine Skill' manual and instigates the exiled Sword faction members to challenge Yue. He bribes members of the Mount Tai Sect to turn against their leader Tianmen, who is betrayed and killed by his own men during a special ceremony. Zuo also sends his lackeys to assassinate Dingjing, one of the three leaders of the (North) Mount Heng Sect. In the earlier part of the novel, Zuo confronts Liu Zhengfeng of the (South) Mount Heng Sect during the latter's retirement ceremony to force him to surrender. Zuo is eventually defeated by Yue Buqun and blinded. He is killed by Linghu Chong during the chaotic scene when they are trapped by Yue Buqun in a cave. Mount Tai Sect The Mount Tai Sect (Ê≥∞Â±±Ê¥æ) is affiliated to Taoism and is led by Tianmen. Tianmen refuses to comply with Zuo Lengshan so Zuo bribes Tianmen's followers to turn against their leader. Tianmen is betrayed and murdered by conspirators during a special ceremony and Yuji is nominated by Zuo to succeed Tianmen. The sect's best fighters are killed when the four sects are trapped by Yue Buqun in a cave at Mount Hua. (North) Mount Heng Sect The (North) Mount Heng Sect (ÊÅÜÂ±±Ê¥æ) is affiliated to Buddhism and is headed by the Three Elder Nuns (Dingjing, Dingxian and Dingyi), with Dingxian as the most senior of the trio. Its members are all female and mostly nuns. Dianxian refuses to submit to Zuo Lengshan so Zuo sends his lackeys to ambush and assassinate the leaders. Dingjing is killed in an ambush while Dingxian and Dingyi are murdered by Yue Buqun in Shaolin Monastery later. Dingxian names Linghu Chong as the new leader of their sect before her death. Linghu is more liberal and he allows others, including jianghu lowlifes and male martial artists, to join the sect. He leads the sect well and earns the respect of others. (South) Mount Heng Sect The (South) Mount Heng Sect (Ë°°Â±±Ê¥æ) is led by a mysterious man called Mo Da. Its swordplay techniques are customised to suit musical themes. Mo Da is known for playing melancholic tunes on his huqin, where his sword is hidden. Mo Da's junior Liu Zhengfeng befriends Qu Yang of the Sun Moon Holy Cult. The duo share the same passion for music and they compose the musical piece Xiaoao Jianghu together. Zuo Lengshan leads his men to confront Liu Zhengfeng during the latter's retirement ceremony and eventually Liu commits suicide together with Qu Yang.

He belonged to a dynasty which originated from Majapahit on Java, and ruled from the palace (puri) of Gelgel.  Accession to the throne  Dalem Seganing is briefly mentioned as king in the religious texts Usana Bali and Rajapurana Besakih. However, most of the surviving details of his reign come from the Babad Dalem, a chronicle from the 18th century.I Wayan Warna, Babad Dalem; Teks dan Terjemahan. Denpasar: Dinas Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan Daerah Tingkat I Bali. He was the younger son of the Gelgel ruler Dalem Baturenggong and the daughter of Dukuh Seganing. He loyally supported his elder brother, king Dalem Bekung, whose reign was beset by rebellions and abortive warfare. According to some versions he took royal powers even before the death of his incapable brother.I B. Rai Putra, Babad Dalem. Denpasar: Upada Sastra 1991, p. 59. He might have been the Balinese king who met the first Dutch visitors to the island in 1597. Dalem Seganing was assisted in his reign by two chief ministers, the brothers Kiyayi Agung and Kiyayi Ler (Lor). The latter is possibly identical with 'Kijloer', the supreme Balinese minister at the time of the 1597 visit. According to a Dutch text, \\"This Kijloer is, besides the king, the uppermost of the entire Island of Bali, and no-one may come to the king in the palace as he wishes, except this Kijloer\\".V.E. Korn, Het adatrecht van Bali. 's-Gravenhage: Naeff 1932, p. 34.  Reign  The reign of Dalem Seganing was briefly troubled by a rebellion by the nobleman Pinatih, an event dated in 1605 by a Balinese text. However, the minister Kiyayi Agung was able to persuade Pinatih to lay down arms. For the rest, the chronicles praise the age of Dalem Seganing as peaceful and successful.C.C. Berg, De middeljavaansche historische traditi√´. Santpoort: Mees 1927, pp. 156-7. His death is dated 1623 in a text, but it has also been suggested that he died in 1651. He had 14 sons of whom Dalem Di Made succeeded to the throne.H. Creese, 'Balinese Babad as Historical Sources', Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 147 1991. In the late historical text Babad Buleleng (1920), the founder of the Buleleng kingdom in North Bali, Gusti Panji Sakti, is claimed to be a son of Dalem Seganing.P. Worsley, Babad Buleleng; A Balinese Dynastic Genealogy. The Hague: M. Nijhoff. The same paternity is claimed for Dewa Manggis I, the ancestor of the kings of Gianyar.Ide Anak Agung Gde Agung, Kenangan Masa Lampau. Jakarta: Yayasan Obor Indonesia 1993, p. 5-6.  External threats and trade relations  From external, in particular Dutch sources, it can be seen that the Gelgel kingdom on Bali was relatively stable and powerful in the first half of the 17th century. The rulers claimed a loose suzerainty over Blambangan in East Java, Lombok, and Sumbawa. However, the warlike activities of the Makassar kingdom of South Sulawesi deprived the Gelgel ruler of his interests in Sumbawa in c. 1618-19, and jeopardized his hold on Lombok.H.J. de Graaf, 'Lombok in de 17e eeuw', Dj√•w√• 21 1941. The Dutch East Indies Company (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie or VOC) was interested in Bali for economic and strategical reasons, as being a Hindu realm that was opposed to the Muslim Mataram kingdom on Java. Among the items coveted by the VOC were rice, cattle and slave women, and a trading post was briefly established in c. 1620. It was quickly withdrawn, though, and Balinese trade with the outside world was henceforth carried out by Dutch private traders, Chinese, and various Indonesian groups.W.A. Hanna, Bali Chronicles. Singapore: Periplus 2004, p. 39. Family Dalem Seganing was married to a daughter of Kiyayi di Ler, minister in Gelgel; and with Gusti Luh Made, a daughter of Gusti Ketut Bebengan. He also had a number of co-wives and mistresses. The king sired 14 sons and a daughter: * Dalem Di Made, who succeeded as King of Bali * Dewa Kaleran (Dewa Anom) * Dewa Karangasem * Dewa Cawu * Dewa Blayu * Dewa Sumerta * Dewa Pamregan * Dewa Lebah * Dewa Sidan * Dewa Kabetan * Dewa Pasawahan * Dewa Kulit * Dewa Bedahulu * Gusti Mambal, adopted as son by the minister Kiyayi di Ler Pranawa * Dewa Randa Guwang, daughter.

Mithun Chakraborty is the antagonist as well as the protagonist in the movie. The film was very much in the news along with Elaan, the Vikram Bhatt directed movie as Mithunda's comeback films to Mumbai production. The team of Mithun Chakraborty and B. Subhash has earlier given films like Disco Dancer, Kasam Paida Karne Wale Ki and Dance Dance. This movie was supposed to be a comeback for a hit team Mithun Chakraborty, B. Subhash and Bappi Lahiri. However, the movie was a disaster at the box office.  Plot  Guru, Dr. Ram Gopal Acharya (Mithun Chakraborty) teaches his disciples the core difference between paap (Sin) and punya (good deeds). One of his life's thinking is that man should never succumb to temptation and sex to \\"sinners\\" and women's only responsibility is to seduce men for money and ultimately destroy them. Doli (Meghna Naidu), bar dancer dances to entertain her customer, drawing false visions of lust and arousing passion in men through her sensual figure movements, keeping the dream that some day her Prince Charming, riding on a white horse would come and take her away. Meanwhile, she meets Suraj (Vikas Bhardwaj), a London-based NRI, who comes to India for business. Love blossoms between the two and Suraj transforms Doli from a symbol of disgrace into a symbol of pure and noble love. But unfortunately, Dr. Acharya's loyalty, rather better to tell the wicked side of him, towards his friend J. K. Malhotra (Navin Nischol), father of Suraj, evokes to insult Doli and calls her a prostitute, sinner, lady of the night, adulteress and blames her for tarnishing Suraj's reputation. Fatigued, Doli finds no way other than the decision to taking refuge in Acharya's ashram. A victorious smile cures his lips, as Acharya cannot resist the lure, the forbidden joy of passion, which he always condemned - SEX. Doli gradually realises Dr. Acharya's lustful intention to his disciples. Suraj rescues Doli from the evil clutches of Acharya as he tries to forcefully marry her. His heart is set on fire with the longing for Doli and his feet begin to quiver to the tune of wild romance, sex and passion performing this story.

Detail from √Årp√°d Feszty's cyclorama titled the Arrival of the Hungarians. The Seven chieftains of the Magyars (or Hungarians) were the leaders of the seven tribes of the Hungarians at the time of their arrival in the Carpathian Basin in AD 895. Constantine VII, emperor of the Byzantine Empire names the seven tribes in his De Administrando Imperio, a list that can be verified with names of Hungarian settlements. The names of the chieftains, however, are not precisely known, as the chronicles include contradictory lists, some of which have been found to be false. Chieftains Constantine VII does not give the names of the chieftains of the Hungarian tribes, but describes some aspects of the leadership. According to Anonymus A Hungarian chronicler known as Anonymus, author of Gesta Hungarorum, names the seven chieftains as: * √Ålmos, father of √Årp√°d * El≈ëd, father of Szabolcs * Ond, father of Ete * Kend (Kond, Kund), father of Korc√°n (Kursz√°n) and Kaplon * Tas, father of L√©l (Lehel) * Huba * T√©t√©ny (T√∂h√∂t√∂m), father of Horka Most probably all persons on this list were real and significant personalities, but the list, as that of the seven chieftains who started the conquest of the Carpathian Basin, is certainly false. Constantine VII names Tas as a grandson of √Årp√°d. The relations of the early Hungarian leaders are subject of debate between historians. According to Simon of K√©za Hungarian chronicler Simon of K√©za names seven captains who led seven tribes: * √Årp√°d, son of √Ålmos, who was the son of El≈ëd, who was the son of √úgyek * Szabolcs * Gyula * √ñrs * K√ºnd, father of Kusid and Kupian * L√©l * V√©rbulcs√∫ (\\"Blood-Bulcs√∫\\"), whose name's origin is that \\"his father was killed by Germans in the battle of Krimhild\\", and for revenge, \\"he drank the blood of some, like wine\\". This list, having more legendary elements, is even less credible than that of Anonymus: only √Årp√°d and Szabolcs match the time of the conquest. Statues In Budapest, Hungary, the Heroes' Square, better known as H≈ës√∂k tere, has a representation of the different chieftains at the base of the column. At the base of the column is a group of seven mounted figures representing the Magyar chieftains who led the Hungarian people into the Carpathian basin. In the front is √Årp√°d, considered the founder of the Hungarian nation. Behind him are the chieftains El≈ëd, Ond, Kond_(chieftain), Tas, Huba, and T√∂h√∂t√∂m (T√©t√©ny). Little survives in the historical record about these individuals and both their costumes and their horses are considered to be more fanciful than historically accurate.

Mentored by the school's prestigious ecclesiastical Dean, Gregorio Funes, del Carril received a juris doctor in 1816, at age 18. He relocated to Buenos Aires, the capital of the newly declared United Provinces of South America, and following a stint as a journalist, he was appointed as an official in the Finance Ministry. General Jos√© Mar√≠a P√©rez de Urdininea, Governor of his native San Juan Province (which had recently seceded from Mendoza Province), called on del Carril to replace Francisco Narciso de Laprida as his Minister of Government in 1822, the highest-ranking advisory position. Amid the turmoil surrounding the Argentine War of Independence, however, P√©rez de Urdininea was returned to active duty in Bolivia by General Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, leaving del Carril as Governor of San Juan.Historical Dictionary of Argentina. London: Scarecrow Press, 1978. Governor of San Juan Taking office in January 1823, the 24-year-old Governor undertook an ambitious modernization program, commissioning the construction of roads, bridges, water works, public buildings and parks, purchasing the province's first printing press, and establishing San Juan's first newspaper. Inheriting a province devastated by the wars, he ordered the first Agricultural Census and created a charitable association. The first lawyer to occupy the governor's post, he established San Juan's judicial system and in 1825, promulgated the \\"May Charter,\\" the province's first constitution. The liberal May Charter, the first in Argentina to guarantee freedom of worship and mandate the separation of church and state, also forced the closure of monasteries, and ran into arduous opposition from the Catholic Church. Facing a firestorm of protest, the governor was overthrown on July 26, and the May Charter was publicly burned. National policy-maker Del Carril's efforts, however, had gained him the respect of the influential Bernardino Rivadavia, a Buenos Aires lawmaker who, in 1826, was elected the first President of Argentina, and who appointed del Carril Argentina's first Finance Minister. Saddled by the Cisplatine War, the nation's finances became dependent on credit from Baring Brothers in London, and del Carril offered the nation's exports as collateral. His introduction of the Argentine peso fuerte - the first local currency convertible into gold, and the first in Argentina with that name - concentrated wealth into exporters and others with access to hard currency, making peso circulation scarce for the public in general and the war more difficult to finance. Rivadavia's National Bank was mismanaged under del Carril, additionally, and unrest resulted in President Rivadavia's resignation in 1827. The dissolution of national government ensued within months, in favor of an Argentine Confederation. The advent of the populist Governor of Buenos Aires Province, Manuel Dorrego, was opposed by del Carril, who became an adviser to a conservative insurrection led by General Juan Lavalle. Lavalle's violent 1828 overthrow of Dorrego returned del Carril to the cabinet as Finance and Foreign Minister. A countercoup led by General Juan Manuel de Rosas, a supporter of Dorrego's, forced Lavalle to call elections, though del Carril's manipulation of the results triggered Rosas' overthrow and del Carril's subsequent exile in Montevideo.Levene, Ricardo. A History of Argentina. University of North Carolina Press, 1978. Exile and return Del Carril remained an active opponent of Rosas' while in exile, supporting a failed 1830 invasion of Entre R√≠os Province and negotiating an entente with the Governor of Corrientes Province. He struggled financially, however, though these difficulties were mitigated by his meeting Tiburcia Dom√≠nguez y L√≥pez Camelo, whom he married and had seven children with. Rosas' grasp on power began to slip after the 1838 blockade imposed by France following the death of a French journalist in Buenos Aires, and del Carril was named Supply Commissioner to the French Navy fleet stationed in the R√≠o de la Plata. His tenure in the post attracted controversy, however, when he became conspicuously wealthy in the process. The 1843 overthrow of his ally, President Fructuoso Rivera of Uruguay, forced del Carril yet again into exile, and he fled to Brazil. He cultivated a friendship via correspondence with the powerful Governor of Entre R√≠os, Justo Jos√© de Urquiza, in subsequent years, and following the latter's defeat of Rosas' forces in the 1852 Battle of Caseros, del Carril returned to Argentina.L√≥pez, Vicente Fidel. Historia de la Rep√∫blica Argentina. Buenos Aires: Sopena, 1960. Vice Presidency Del Carril was elected to the assembly that approved the 1853 Argentine Constitution. Enmities remaining from the Rosas era thwarted an opportunity to return to the Governor's post in San Juan, however, and despite his personal efforts, Buenos Aires lawmakers rejected the new constitution. His belonging to the Buenos Aires-centric Unitarian Party and rapport with Urquiza (whom Buenos Aires distrusted) made del Carril an easy choice for the latter's running-mate in the elections that November, however, and their national unity ticket was elected handily in the electoral college. President Urquiza took care to preserve balance in his government between the two camps, placing the Vice President as a counterweight to the Federalist Interior Minister (Home Secretary), Santiago Derqui. Del Carril became the most prominent voice for Buenos Aires interests in the administration, and compounded with a falling-out with erstwhile allies in his native San Juan Province, this ultimately frustrated his hopes that Urquiza might support his 1860 presidential candidacy (support which was tantamount to victory). Nominating Derqui instead, Urquiza's choice led to renewed conflict with Buenos Aires, and to Derqui's resignation and exile in 1861. National unity on the brink, del Carril negotiated a settlement between Urquiza and the leader of the Buenos Aires insurrection, General Bartolom√© Mitre, and when the latter was elected President the following September, del Carril was appointed to the Argentine Supreme Court. A memorial to del Carril sits atop his Recoleta crypt Del Carril was a conservative justice, and reliably voted in favor of the executive's frequent use of state of siege declarations and capital punishment. This record helped him secure an appointment as Chief Justice in 1870 by Mitre's supporter and successor, President Domingo Sarmiento, and an uneventful tenure ended with his retirement in 1877. He was again in the spotlight, however, after the 1881 publication by historian √Ångel Carranza of correspondence between del Carril and Lavalle during the 1828 coup. The letters revealed that del Carril pressed for the duly-elected Governor Dorrego's execution, advising Lavalle that claims of a fair trial should be concocted, adding that \\"if we should need to lie to posterity, we lie.\\" The former Vice President lived afterwards in seclusion, and died in his Buenos Aires home in 1883, at age 84. Epilogue Del Carril became a wealthy man, and in later life owned over 130,000 hectares (330,000 acres) of land in the agriculturally productive La Pampa Province (worth around a million dollars, at the time). Debts incurred by his wife's spending habits strained the marriage, however, and the seasoned lawyer obtained a discharge of his responsibility for their repayment (leaving the debts in her name, solely). The couple subsequently separated, and after the judge's 1883 burial in an ornate La Recoleta Cemetery crypt, Mrs. del Carril commissioned the grave's sculptor, Camilo Romairone, to create a bust of her likeness - with its back turned towards that of her husband's; she died in 1898.

His confirmed victory total ranked him fourth among Italian aces of the war. After the war he worked as an inventor, working in the areas of aviation communications and explosives. He died in 1928 as a result of injuries that he received during an accident in his laboratory. Military career Flavio Baracchini was born at Villafranca in Lunigiana on 28 July 1895. He was educated at technical schools in La Spezia. As World War I heated up, he was assigned to the Italian Army's 3rd Engineer Battalion. However, in Autumn 1915, he reported to the SIT School in Torino for pilot's training. He was awarded licenses on 15 October and 1 December 1915; he then qualified on Voisins on 27 January 1916. On 28 February 1916, he was posted to 7a Squadriglia (later redesignated 26a Squadriglia) and piloted a Voisin for them until 20 November 1916. In December 1916, he was commissioned as a Sottotenente. He also reported to Cascina Costa to train on Nieuport fighters.Franks et al 1997, pp. 133-134.Franks 2000, pp. 76-77. However, Baracchini had no success as a fighter pilot until May 1917, when he was assigned to the newly formed 81a Squadriglia. His claim of the 15th went unconfirmed, but he got his first victory five days later, when he shot down an Albatros south of Marco. He scored again on the 23rd and 25th. He scored once more, on 6 June 1917, while flying a Nieuport 11, before upgrading to a Nieuport 17. He used his new plane to tally four more triumphs that month. By the 22nd, he had scored eight victories by fighting 35 times in 39 days. For this extraordinary display of prowess, Flavio Baracchini became the first Italian fighter pilot to win the Gold Medal for Military Valor. The Hanriot HD. 1 operated by Baracchini, on display at the Italian Air Force Museum near to Bracciano, Rome He transferred to 76a Squadriglia and a Hanriot HD.1 on 14 July 1917. He also evaluated a loaner Spad VII for possible use by the squadron; it was rejected. Baracchini won twice in July. In August, he was credited with two more victories, on the 3rd and 8th, while his first claim for an observation balloon went unconfirmed. He was so seriously wounded in the left jaw on 8 August 1917 that he was out of action for nine months. Upon his return, he again had an unconfirmed credit on a balloon, on 3 April 1918. Then he was transferred back to 81a Squadriglia. He had four confirmed and four unconfirmed wins for May. He began his final month of combat with a double victory on 15 June, with a third claim going unconfirmed. On the 18th, he once again was denied credit for downing a balloon. On the 21st, he finally became a balloon buster, for his nineteenth credit. He scored again on both the 22nd and the 25th, to bring his total to 21 confirmed and nine unconfirmed. However, on the 25th, he was again severely wounded, this time when he was shot down by machine gun fire. Post war life He survived the war, and quit flying in 1921. He turned to inventing items that would be useful to fliers. His first invention was a signalling device for communicating with airplanes, which was adopted by Italian aviators. He then began development of an explosive mixture in a laboratory. It ignited accidentally and burned him severely on 29 July 1928. He lingered a short while, before succumbing on 18 August 1928.

Located in the Mexican state of Guanajuato, the site was first excavated in 1995, while the official excavation began in 2002. Public access was first allowed in 2011. However, unlike its famous counterparts such as Chichen-Itz√°, access is strictly controlled due to it sitting on private property, one of the largest ex-haciendas in Guanajuato. The Otomi people have lived in the valley of San Miguel De Allende for thousands of years. It is presumed that construction at Ca√±ada De La Virgen most likely began after the collapse of the Teotihuacan culture, where they are believed to have previously resided along with other tribes in the Valley of Mexico (near Mexico City today), around 530 AD. The Otomi were avid sky watchers and passed information down from generation to generation. These people used astronomical criteria, religious beliefs and agricultural cycles to select the Laja River Valley for the construction of this Pre-Hispanic burial site. The site faces the celestial north, where the stars spin around in a circle throughout the year. The moon moves up the stairs of the pyramid as its cycle advances. It rises and falls perfectly in pyramid notches at key times in the lunar calendar and during solstice periods. The site was ruled by the Moon, the Sun, and Venus, as demonstrated by archaeoastronomical studies conducted by the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH). Its main features are: Ceremonial Avenue, House of the Wind, House of the Longest Night- scientists believe has some relationship with the Otomi‚Äôs belief in the duality of the heavens and earth (Sun and Moon, Man and Woman, etc.), and House of the Thirteen Heavens. Around 900 AD, the Otomi civilization began to decline and by 1050 AD, the site was abandoned, only to be rediscovered at the end of the 20th century. Work and research continue to this day. Site On site are seven enormous architectonic structures (pyramidal structures) of different sizes and styles, that form sunken patios, squares, a game of ball, esplanades, and a road. Ceramic superficial vestiges found suggest that the last occupation would be tied chronologically to the Toltec expansion. This prehispanic settlement is located on the northern Mesoamerican border, its main monuments were sky observatories. Its urban design reflects cosmic cycles linked with farmers‚Äô groups‚Äô life that also were hunter-gatherer in the surrounding semi-desert regions, and traded with other Mesoamerican regions artifacts used in ritual activities. The site shares Mesoamerican architectural-oriented patterns, i.e. the symmetry axis is directed to the Sun and Moon rise and setting (East-West), in addition to its strategic position -visual domain of the Laja river basin, where the site is located - determined the pre-Hispanic site importance for rituals and ceremonies. The close relationship between the architectural complex construction and star cycles is mainly observed on complex A or \\"13 skies House\\" vital space for the celestial observation, whose sunken patio functioned as water mirror from which the priests could look at the sky and interpret aspects in the interests for the agricultural cycle. The buildings on site are located on a plateau that was artificially filled to obtain an 18¬∞ tilt, thus ancient Otomi managed the Sun to pass over various points of the architectural complex, marking calendar dates linked to survival control as well as seeding and harvesting activities. History The Toltec-Chichimec founded villages, built pyramids and other architectural structures throughout the central basin of the river now called Laja, known as San Miguel in the 16th century, and apparently, a little less than thousand years ago was called P√°nuco. According to the list of names appearing in the Toltec - Chichimec Codex, which refers to the various provinces that formed the Toltec Empire, Ca√±ada de la Virgen would be located northwest of the Toltec territory. The name of its capital is unknown, because the name is unreadable in the abovementioned list, everything indicates it is located a few kilometers south of the site in question. It is a city made up of various architectural, elements including a ballgame court and a huge plaza with three pyramid foundations. Furnaces remains found in the northeast area demonstrate that members of this society were capable of limestone deposits exploitation. The Seven onsite architectural structures, considered monumental as exceed the human scale, are huge step pyramids with sloped sides of different sizes and styles that form various spaces, such as sunken patios, squares, esplanades, a road. Occupation chronology According to surface ceramic vestiges (Plumbate), the last occupation would be linked to the maximum Toltec expansion. The historical overview of the region begins in the preclassical period with the Chup√≠cuaro, tradition, very important in Mesoamerica. This tradition is characterized by its advanced ceramic industry and its complex religious expressions, which indicate at an early consolidation of a group in power. The Chup√≠cuaro tradition was established along the banks of rivers and spread to almost the entire Guanajuato territory. Chup√≠cuaro disappeared at about 350 AD., to allow the second tradition of advanced farmers. Also identified as the regional development stage, the Sunken Patio tradition covers the classic and epiclassical periods (350 to 900 AD.) It distinguished itself by architectural innovation of sunken or closed patios, associated with pyramidal structures reaching monumental heights. This is considered to be the stage of advanced agricultural development and the expansion of the border northward. During this period Guanajuato developed an organization and work specialization in governing centers. Still heavily argued and linked to the agricultural frontier withdrawal, new hypotheses about Toltec presence propose that it coincided with the arrival of proto-Toltec groups to the Basin of Mexico, between 900 and 1000 AD., and not with the collapse of Tula, Hidalgo, around 1200 AD. Around 1350 AD., with the collapsed agricultural frontier, these lands were the scene of the development of the Chichimec tribes. With different ethnic affiliation, identified are the guachichiles, guamare, copuces, guaxabanes, pames, and Otomi. At that time, the border between nomadic and sedentary groups was the Lerma River. At this cultural scenario epoch can be placed the prehispanic development of Ca√±ada de la Virgen. Architecture Remains of a pyramidal structure Ca√±ada de la Virgen consists of closely linked architectural complexes. Special note for Complex A or ‚Äú13 Sky House‚Äù - critical space for celestial observation - consists of a sunken patio, a pyramidal basement (over 15 m high) and platforms that close to the East, North and South as a whole. Funeral findings in this complex have given rise to forensic studies that have provided information about cultural and cranial deformation, burial, ancestral worship and rituals associated with the foundation of workplace practices. At the top of the complex is the Red Temple and its abstract mural, which are red and black horizontal bands which allude to the day and night. As part of the central campus is complex B or ‚ÄúHouse of the longest night‚Äù. It is an architectonic group with several structures (pyramid basement, sunken patio and platforms) which had different functions. An example is the asymmetry of the pyramidal basement (laid out Southwest), which has a room in the South side on the walls. This architectonic type is only documented in the Maya area (Yucatec Puuc) and Ca√±ada de la Virgen. During archaeological excavations in this compound a cross section public functions and rituals substructure with was found. Structures The site consists of five groups of monuments, the most important of which is Complex A (side annexes, Temple basement, closed patio, main esplanade, south esplanade and road).Zona Arqueol√≥gica Ca√±ada de la Virgen Guia San Miguel. Acceso Agosto 2010 During excavations several important archaeological items were found, such as pots (Ollas, metals, seeds, human remains, etc. The main square, located west of the site comprises basements A and B, which are the most important. Basement A, with the largest volume and complexity, is composed of different elements: step pyramid, stairways, building or upper temple, central and side patios, esplanade and an avenue. Complex A As in most cases, the largest volume basement was found at the center, the remainder is distributed in all directions, configuring various squares and esplanades. Six bodies comprise the pyramidal basement; at the top are remains of a building. The patio geometry in relation to the plaza-esplanade and eastern road denotes the domain reached by the Toltec-Chichimec architects in design and construction. The top building was divided into two sections by a central staircase, similar to late postclassical Aztec structures. It was built with stone walls plastered with mud and stucco (mixture of lime and sand) and painted red oxide (towards its penultimate occupation) and ochre (last). Indicated by remains at the southwest corner of one of the rooms that still exist, miraculously if we consider that in the late 1940s it was dynamited during an alien occupation, losing much of northwest side corner. Complex B House of the Longest NightIt shares characteristics, with some small variations. In this case, the top building is a little to the south, i.e. is not centered with the plaza. To the west is a little elevated esplanade which forms part of the main square. There is some evidence there was another road, which would start at the south side of the basement to another part of the ravine surrounding the site. It is worth noting that in this structure patio remains of a stone anthropomorphic sculpture were found, consistent with what would be the head and left foot of some postclassical individual from the northern center of Mesoamerica. Complex C This complex has not yet been excavated (as of 2017). Complex D House of the Wind (foreground) and House of the Thirteen Heavens (background) North basement, with very special features, such as a mixed base: the bottom base is rectangular, while those at top are circular; this mixture has only been found on very few structures of the region. Complex E The structure at the south of the complex, comprises a step pyramid basement forming an open patio to the south, unlike the others enclosed on four sides. A piece of stonework that may correspond to a frieze sector or a jamb was detected on the northeast corner of the structure.  Restoration The constant looting and vandalism in the main basement of Complex (A), mainly the large holes at the bottom, on bodies 2 and 3, made necessary in 1989 to make some partial restoration interventions (architectural volumetric restitution) to prevent the collapse of the southwest corner of the basement, the upper bodies stability was compromised. Visiting the Site The archaeological complex opened to the public on February 15, 2011. The site is open Tuesday through Sunday, from 9 am to 3 pm. For those without transportation or seeking bilingual guides, there are multiple tour operators in San Miguel de Allende that can provide expert guides and transportation. The site is unusually protected and there are some considerations for visitors. There is a Visitor Center with parking and a museum (opened in 2017). Access to the site is only by a scheduled shuttle bus which takes visitors near the site. From there, the walk is roughly 3 km round trip, and you must be accompanied by an escort who will ensure that you return to your shuttle bus on schedule; round trip time from the Visitor Center is 2.5 hrs. No bags, backpacks or purses are allowed into the site because of recent thefts of artifacts. Small camera bags, cameras, and water are allowed. Visitors with mobility issues may find the tour challenging.

Months later, Bobby is asked to the stand in her parents' divorce trial, as a witness of her mother's infidelity, but she refuses to leave any information. Her parents divorce and a judge grants Joan custody of Bobby for all year except summer. Later, Joan marries Michael but Bobby refuses to accept Michael as her stepfather. Michael grows tired of Bobby's behavior and tells Joan that the girl is breaking their marriage apart. When Bobby returns to her father in the summer, she is introduced to his new fianc√©e, Louise Norman, and gets even more upset. A psychiatrist tells Joan and Ray that Bobby needs stability and continuity in her life to cope, and strongly suggests that only one of them should have sole custody over her. None of the parents feels up to this task, and instead Bobby is sent away to a boarding school. Bobby is eventually visited by her parents, one at a time, and one of her schoolmates tells her that she will be used to being alone. To the sound of church bells playing the same tune as on her toy piano, Bobby vows to herself that she will never leave her own children when she grows up, and tuck them to bed every night.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/70794/Child-of-Divorce/ Cast * Sharyn Moffett as Bobby * Regis Toomey as Ray * Madge Meredith as Joan * Walter Reed as Michael * Una O'Connor as Nora * Doris Merrick as Louise * Harry Cheshire as Judge * Selmer Jackson as Dr. Sterling * Lillian Randolph as Carrie * Pat Prest as Linda * Gregory Muradian as Freddie * George McDonald as Donnie * Patsy Converse as Betty * Ann Carter as Peggy ;Uncredited * Arthur Space as Joan's attorney * William Forrest as Proctor Production The film was the first feature directed by Richard Fleischer (credited as Richard O.

Plot After her father dies, Patricia Warren, a girl of nine, must go from her home in Georgia to live with her wealthy but vain and egotistical aunt Elizabeth Ames in Boston. Pat insists on bringing her beloved dog Banjo, an English Setter, when she boards the train north. Since Pat does not want to leave her dog alone, she travels by Banjo's side in the baggage car, where she meets and befriends Bill, who works for the railroad. When her aunt Elizabeth receives news of Pat's arrival, she has recently broken her engagement to Dr. Bob Hartley, and is on her way to Bermuda. Elizabeth has to cancel her vacation to take care of her niece. Elizabeth is not happy about Banjo accompanying the young girl, and forces the dog to stay outside of the house, despite Pat's protests. The aunt also has quite a few remarks about the girl's uncivilized behavior. A pen is built for Banjo in the garden, but though the servant, Jeffries, builds its walls higher and higher, Banjo still manages to break out. The second time Banjo breaks out, he hurts his paw and Pat takes him to Dr. Bob for treatment. When the doctor finds out that Pat is related to Elizabeth, he tries to make the aunt relent on her niece, but without any luck. Pat finds out about the previous relationship between her aunt and the doctor, and decides to help her out. Pat pretends to be ill and must see the doctor on several occasions, and the doctor eagerly agrees to continue play her game. Pat's goal is to make her aunt happier so that Banjo can be accepted and let into the house. Elizabeth goes easier on her \\"sick\\" niece and they come closer to each other and Bob. She even warms up enough to Banjo to let Pat walk him around on a leash, but then Pat and her newfound friends in the neighborhood borrow a shotgun to put Banjo's skills as a hunting dog to the test. They misfire, hitting a police car, and Elizabeth decides that the dog has to be sent back to Georgia. Pat is mortified by the decision, and runs away in the night and boards a train to Georgia to follow her dog. She arrives before Elizabeth and Bob arrive to take her back, and runs into the swamp to look for her favorite pet. When a bobcat attacks Pat in the swamp, Banjo turns up and saves her. One of her previous servants, Jasper, turns up and shoots the bobcat before it can kill Banjo. Pat is reunited with Elizabeth and Dr. Bob, and is promised that Banjo can come with them all back to Boston.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/862/Banjo/ Cast *Sharyn Moffett as Patricia \\"Pat\\" Warren *Jacqueline White as Elizabeth Ames *Walter Reed as Dr. Bob Hartley *Una O'Connor as Harriet *Lanny Rees as Ned *Louise Beavers as Lindy *Herbert Evans as Jeffries *Theron Jackson as Exodus *Howard McNeely as Genesis *Ernest Whitman as Jasper *Banjo as Himself *Robert Bray as Police officer Production Richard Fleischer's first feature as director was a Sharyn Moffett vehicle, Child of Divorce.

It produced major new physics textbooks, instructional movies, and classroom laboratory materials, which were used by high schools around the world during the 1960s and 1970s and beyond.  Original members * Professor Jerrold Zacharias, chairman * Professor Eric Rogers * Professor Francis L. Friedman * Professor George Gamow * Professor Sanford C. Brown * Professor Victor Weisskopf Development In 1956, MIT professors Jerrold Zacharias and Francis Friedman organized a group of university and high school physics educators to reform the teaching of this fundamental science at the secondary level. There was concern that traditional teaching failed to convey a sense of excitement and inquiry, and a way of thinking about physics beyond rote memorization of equations. After the launch of Sputnik by the Russians in 1957, the US National Science Foundation greatly increased funding, to radically improve the teaching of science in the country's response to Cold War rivalries. Eventually, several hundred physicists, high school teachers, apparatus designers, writers, and editors would become involved with the project. There was a concern that traditional high school physics had devolved to a hodge- podge of Newtonian mechanics and other topics that was poorly integrated, with increasing emphasis on the peculiarities of current technology. In contrast, the PSSC approach emphasized the unity of physical inquiry, organized around broad principles such as the conservation laws, rather than a series of disparate equations to be memorized. Details of current technology would be deemphasized, and fewer topics would be covered, to highlight a deep understanding of fundamental principles and the spirit and culture of scientific investigation. Hands-on laboratory work was regarded as an integral part of the course, including open-ended explorations and discovery of new concepts, rather than simple verification of received knowledge. Photographer Berenice Abbott and filmmaker Richard Leacock were recruited to make visual aids to understanding complex phenomena such as wave propagation, kinetics, and electrical charge. They brought an esthetic sense of visual beauty to illustrations of elegant physical concepts. More than 50 educational movies were made of physical phenomena, including some which were too expensive, dangerous, or infeasible to demonstrate directly in a classroom. Stroboscopic photos made with the assistance of MIT professor Doc Edgerton were used to illustrate Newton's laws of motion, including what would become an iconic image of a bouncing ball on the front cover of the textbook. In 1960, the textbook and course materials were first published by D. C. Heath and Company (which became a division of Raytheon during 1966‚Äì1995), and a series of coordinating laboratory equipment and an experimental handbook was also released. The otherwise-unrelated Heathkit company marketed a series of its standard electronic instruments (e.g. oscilloscopes and signal generators), specially modified in some cases, to coordinate with the laboratory handbook. Another company marketed a small table-top water-filled tray which could project an image of wave phenomena, which became an influential educational aid used at both the high school and college levels. Doubleday published a \\"Science Studies Series\\" of over 50 small paperback books on related scientific subjects at a high school level, covering topics such as crystal growing, waves and beaches, subatomic particles, the universe, and biographies of notable scientists. The non-profit Educational Service Incorporated, which became Education Development Center, was created to continue the work of PSSC. By the 1964‚Äì1965 school year, about half the US students enrolled in high school physics (200,000 students, 5000 teachers) were reportedly using the PSSC course materials. However, considerable resistance developed among some teachers to the disruption of traditional methods of teaching. Criticisms ranged from complaints about an informal tone in the text, deferring the use of technical terms, to an attempt to cover too many concepts at too deep an intellectual level for average students. Legacy From the beginning, there was an interest in assessing student progress and the overall effectiveness of the new curriculum through a series of 10 tests, to be administered throughout the year.

The station was situated on the southern side of a level crossing to the south of St. Michael's tunnel, one of the line's main civil engineering features. Closed in 1954, nothing remains of St. Michael's today: a footpath and cycleway runs through the site.  History  Tenterden St. Michael's was opened in 1912 to serve the local community of St Michaels on the outskirts of Tenterden. It was situated immediately south of the ungated level crossing over Grange Road. St. Michael's was little more than a halt station consisting of no more than a single platform made of sleepers and, for some time, a small corrugated iron hut which served as a ticket office. So modest were the facilities that the wooden picket gate leading from the road for the use of passengers has been described as \\"more obvious than the halt itself\\". By August 1938, the ticket office had closed and passengers were obliged to purchase their tickets on the train; the station had also become run-down and the track weed-strewn. It had fallen into a dangerous and decrepit state by 1953, the condition of the platform sleepers having seriously deteriorated. Regular passenger services on the line were withdrawn after the last train on Saturday 2 January 1954.Garrett, S., p. 47. The line was engineered and operated by Colonel H F Stephens. One of his 'bigger' feats was St Michaels Tunnel, located just north of the halt.

The second largest earthquake in the area since the modernization of earthquake monitoring devices, it was felt north to Poland and south to Italy and Greece. The death toll makes it the second deadliest earthquake to occur in 1986 worldwide, after major seism of San Salvador that took the lives of almost 1,500 people. One local news facility listed that the earthquake measured 6.5 on the Richter magnitude scale, and the USGS listed its seismic moments as 5.6 and 7.9. A research paper of V. I. Ulomov cited this earthquake with magnitude 7.1. Its epicenter was somewhere in the Vrancea Mountains. The focal mechanism of the earthquake was described as \\"moderately well controlled\\", suggesting reverse faulting with some strike-slip motion.  Geography  The epicenter was pinpointed to Vrancea County, specifically to the Vrancea Mountains, about north of Bucharest. In 1977, another strong quake ruptured oil fields in the area.  Aftershocks  The rupture was located at a depth of between 131 and 148 km, as revealed by the location of aftershock hypocenters. The strongest aftershock occurred in the morning of September 2, 1986, at 05:00 (EET), at 143 km depth, with magnitude 5.0 , and was felt in Bucharest with an intensity of about III‚ÄìIV degrees on the Mercalli intensity scale. In total, 77 aftershocks were recorded with a magnitude over 3.2 on the Richter scale, of which 19 exceeded the value of 4.0 magnitude on the Richter scale.\\"Seismicity of Romania\\" , National Institute for Earth Physics, section Vrancea subcrustal zone  Damage and casualties  The earthquake was felt in at least eight geographically diverse countries, affecting most of southeast Europe. The worst affected area was in the Foc»ôani‚ÄìB√¢rlad region, where intensity VIII (Severe) damage was recorded, causing a church to collapse. In Moldova, the earthquake had, in patches, quite severe effects. In Chi»ôinƒÉu, 4 apartment buildings collapsed, resulting in at least 100 casualties. In southwestern Moldova, near the Prut floodplain, were observed subsidence of land, sand spouts and the formation of craters near the Prut riverbed. In Bucharest, 50 laborers who worked in the basement of a building died when they were crushed by piles of rubble.\\"A magnitude 3.6 earthquake occurred near Bucharest\\" , Realitatea.net Causing 150 deaths, the earthquake also injured 558 people and fractured at least 55,000 households. Intensity of VII (Very strong) was reported in Bucharest and in northern Bulgaria. In addition, intensities of V (Moderate) were recorded in Skopje (now the capital of North Macedonia), suggesting the earthquake was widespread. This is confirmed by reports of the earthquake as far north as Hungary and east Poland, and as far south as Greece and Italy. Lesser intensities of IV (Light) in Simferopol and Kiev in the Soviet Union and in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and III (Weak) in Moscow and Titograd, Yugoslavia were recorded.

Weiler of The New York Times was positive: \\"Expertise, if not imagination, is evident in the explosive, action-oriented direction of Richard Fleischer... The Don Is Dead has the attributes of some lively, pithily accented performances that are adult and effectively natural. Among these are Forrest, as the brainly hood who attempts to escape the racket, but winds up a don, Al Lettieri, as his roughhewn, dependent, ill-fated brother, and Forster, as the rising, vengeful muscleman who is eventually cut down. As the embattled don who is finally felled by a stroke, not a gun, Quinn is moodily menacing and as polished and relaxed as a professional long familiar with this sort of role.\\"A.H.

It is one of the many Palmerston Forts built on the island to protect it in response to a perceived French invasion. Context The 1859 Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom recommended improvements to coastal defences in response to a perceived greater threat of invasion due to the strengthening of the French Navy at that time. The fortifications, a total of 70 forts and batteries, were constructed around the English coast as a result of the commission's findings, representing the largest programme of coastal defence works since the time of Henry VIII. They form a distinctive group in terms of their design and armament. Their construction was very costly, causing the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gladstone, to threaten resignation. They were known by critics as 'Palmerston's follies'. Construction Construction took place from 1861 to 1863, costing ¬£6,233. The battery is located atop a high cliff on the coast just southwest of Sandown. There were concerns raised at an early stage that erosion at the base of the cliff could affect the stability of the parapet wall. The battery was built to a rectangular plan with no wall along the cliff edge, but moats containing Carnot walls to either side and the rear of the battery. Armament During its active history from 1863 to 1910, the battery had a variety of armament. The initial five RBL 7 inch Armstrong guns were replaced by five RML 64 pounder 64 cwt guns in 1873. By 1892 three of these guns had been replaced by a pair of RML 10 inch 18 ton guns set back from the cliff edge, after partial reconstruction of the battery. By 1902, after further works that included the construction of underground magazines, the battery had a pair of BL 6 inch Mk VII naval guns and a pair of QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval guns. In 1905 the 12 pounders were taken out of active service, followed by the 6 inch guns in 1910. By 1926, all parts of the guns had been removed and the land had been sold to Sandown town council by 1930. Current status The site of the battery now forms part of the Battery Gardens park. It was scheduled under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 on 7 September 2000. Two buildings are being converted to house the National Poo Museum.

It tells the story of two rival nightclub owners played by Terry-Thomas and Billy Boyle. The cast also includes Barry Humphries, Stephanie de Sykes, Frank Thornton and many contemporary pop artists such as The Rubettes, Mud and Kenny. Plot Set in the fictitious English borough of Sludgely, the film centres on two rival nightclubs, located side by side. The decrepit Golden Nugget, which features strip shows and music hall variety turns, is run by Max Nugget (Terry-Thomas), assisted by his hypochondriac nephew Rodney (Barry Humphries), while Sound City is a pop music club, run by Gary (Billy Boyle). A local magistrate rules that only one club's license will be renewed at the end of the month. The two clubs then attempt to improve their entertainment by attracting top acts. The film culminates in a comedic brawl in which a dividing wall is smashed, resulting in a merger between the two venues.

Production Side By Side was the third movie directed by Australian Bruce Beresford, who had previously found success in England by teaming up with his compatriot Barry Humphries for the bawdy comedy The Adventures of Barry McKenzie (1972) and its sequel, Barry McKenzie Holds His Own (1974). Beresford's biographer Peter Coleman wrote that Beresford made Side By Side for the money and because it was difficult for him to obtain work after the Barry McKenzie films. The movie was funded by the film division of Laurence Myers' GTO Records. Producer Drummond Challis had worked previously with Beresford and Humphries on Barry McKenzie Holds His Own. Music A tie-in soundtrack album was released in 1977 under the title Original Rocking Hits From The Film \\"Side By Side\\" on the Pickwick Records label (SHM 902), and featured Stephanie de Sykes performing her highest UK charting song, \\"Born With a Smile on My Face\\". The late Dave Mount, drummer of Mud, had a starring role in the film. The artist \\"Twogether\\" that performs the \\"Side By Side\\" film theme, may actually be Lynsey de Paul and Barry Blue, the song's composers. The film closes with a singalong rendition of the popular standard of the same name, Side by Side, led by Mud and Hello with Barry Humphries on piano. Critical reception Graham McCann's 2009 biography of Terry-Thomas, Bounder!, describes the film as \\"a low-budget piece of nonsense\\" which was savaged by critics \\"both for its 'marshmallow plot' and the 'evident lack of enthusiasm' shown by most of its cast.\\" Musical film author Stephen Glynn wrote that Side by Side used the two clubs' rivalry \\"as an excuse to feature of a roster of Glam acts ... filmed in performance mode with no discernible difference to a Thursday night episode of Top of the Pops\\".

He was a leading representative of the pro- independence tendency on the far right of Austrian politics and as such was opposed to the Nazi Party which supported the incorporation of Austria into a Gro√üdeutschland. Early life Steidle was born in the Untermais district of Meran (Merano), South Tyrol, with his father having originally come from the Duchy of W√ºrttemberg.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Simon & Schuster, 1990, p. 375 Steidle studied at the University of Innsbruck, completing his doctorate in jurisprudence. Unfit for military service when the First World War broke out in 1914 he instead became an assistant to a military court and after the war worked as a lawyer in Innsbruck. Emergence Steidle was closely associated with the Tirolische Bauernbund, a peasants group affiliated to the Christian Social Party. As part of his involvement in this group he set up a militia in Innsbruck to oppose the activities of the Social Democrats, whom he saw as fomenting revolution in the city. Having already been made Landesrat of Tyrol in October, Steidle sought to consolidate the power of his militia group by forging links with leaders of similar rightist groups in south Germany such as Georg Escherich, Rudolf Kanzler and Franz Ritter von Epp. Steidle also built a career in politics alongside his militia activity and represented the Christian Social Party in the Tyrolean Landtag from 1919 to 1934 and also sat in the Bundesrat from 1922 to 1931, twice chairing the body. The Heimwehr in Tyrol was established on 15 May 1920 with Steidle confirmed as the group's Landesf√ºhrer. The new group's stated intention was the prevention of further loss of territory to Italy, following the loss of Steidle's homeland.Philip Morgan, Fascism in Europe, 1919-1945, 2003, p. 33 For his part Steidle saw the sole aim of Heimwehr as being anti-communism and rejected the anti-semitism that became the hallmark of other leaders. He summed up his opinion by arguing that he hated only Jewish Marxists and that patriotic Jews were welcome in the Heimwehr.Bruce F. Pauley, From Prejudice to Persecution: A History of Austrian Anti-Semitism, 1998, p. 176 Despite this Steidle had previously been a member of the Antisemitenbund in 1919.Pauley, From Prejudice to Persecution, p. 185 His newly moderated views caused some controversy within the Heimwehr and led to Steidle splitting from his former ally Walter Pfrimer, the regional leader in Styria and a staunch anti-Semite.Pauley, From Prejudice to Persecution, p. 177 In the early 1920s he advocated the union of Tyrol with Germany because of the increasingly liberal slant of the government in Vienna.Rolf Steininger, Austria, Germany and the Cold War, 2008, pp. 4-5 Although he would bactrack from this idea he nonetheless maintained links with the right in Germany during the early 1920s, receiving weapons from Georg Escherich and Rudolf Kanzler whilst he took on as his deputy Waldemar Pabst after he fled Germany following the failure of the Kapp Putsch.F. L. Carsten, The Rise of Fascism, 1982, p. 224 Leadership Steidle (bearded) accompanying Waldemar Pabst (carrying bouquet) on his entry to Austria from Italy, c. 1930Having become one of the leading figures in the Heimwehr, Steidle was in 1927 chosen as the group's overall leader in a largely unsuccessful attempt to create unity amongst the disparate regional groups.John T. Lauridsen, Nazism and the Radical Right in Austria, 1918-1934, 2007, p. 152 In this role he worked closely with Waldemar Pabst in an attempt to improve the organisation of the Heimwehr, with Steidle seeking to build up the Heimwehr as a political movement and Pabst concentrating on improving the military side of the group. Now an important figure, Steidle enjoyed a good relationship with Johann Schober and was considered for a place in his third government, although no appointment was made.Lauridsen, Nazism and the Radical Right, p. 172 At this time however Steidle still maintained an ambiguous attitude towards the possibility of Anschluss despite his membership of the Austrian nationalist Christian Social Party. He also served as president of the √ñsterreichischer Alpenverein for a time.Lauridsen, Nazism and the Radical Right, p. 127 As leader of the Heimwehr he attempted to unite the movement behind an agreed platform of corporatist fascism in 1930 by writing the so-called 'Korneuburger Oath'.R.J.B. Bosworth, The Oxford Handbook of Fascism, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 439 However agreement could not be reached with the regional leaders and indeed the oath only threw divisions into an even sharper focus as some regions refused to countenance it.Bosworth, The Oxford Handbook of Fascism, p. 440 By the end of the year Steidle was forced to relinquish his role as overall head of the movement in favour of Ernst R√ºdiger Starhemberg.Bosworth, The Oxford Handbook of Fascism, p. 441 Later years Steidle grew closer to the anti-Nazism of the Austrofascists who came to dominate Austrian politics in the mid-1930s and in 1934 he was appointed Consul general in Trieste under Kurt Schuschnigg's government. Steidle held this position until the Anschluss when, along with many of his fellow government officials, he was sent to Buchenwald.G√ºnter Bischof, Anton Pelinka & Michael Gehler, Austrian Foreign Policy in Historical Context, 2005, p. 45 Steidle was sent to the camp on the basis that in his roles of Landesrat of Tyrol from March 1933 to November 1934 and security director of Tyrol in late 1933 he had allegedly treated members of the outlawed Austrian Nazi Party with undue harshness. Steidle was shot and killed by camp guards at Buchenwald on 30 August 1940. According to official reports he had been in the act of attempting to escape from Buchenwald when he was gunned down.

Plot Young Alec Albion plans successfully to kill his rich uncle with an ice bullet which will melt away, leaving no evidence. He gets an alibi by having the chief commissioner of police living in the same building as his chief witness. He sets himself up in an apartment overlooking his uncle's. He invites over the new commissioner of police, Sir Randolph, for tea and tells him he has had a premonition about his uncle's murder. The murder is committed. Sir Randolph is convinced Rex did it, especially after he discovers that the young man was his uncle's heir but was going to be disinherited the following day. He says while they were having tea, Rex went into another room and shot dead his uncle. Randolph has Rex arrested and tried for murder. Rex is found not guilty. Knowing he cannot be tried twice for the same crime, he confesses to the murder, explaining he shot his uncle with a rifle and a bullet made of ice. Rex talks through the murder with the inspector and then realises that he killed the wrong person. His uncle is still alive. Rex is arrested.

Simmonds as Sylvia * Vernon Smythe as Judge * Peter Bull as Prosecuting Counsel * Basil Dignam as Defending Counsel Original play: Mr Smart Guy The script was based on a play Mr Smart Guy by Alec Coppel, who wrote it in England at the beginning of the war. They play had originally been called North Light. Plot Rex Albion wishes to take possession of a particular flat which is opposite that of his rich uncle. He moves in and invites the chief commissioner of police, Sir Randolph Towe, over for tea. While this happens, the uncle is shot dead while sitting on the balcony... but no bullet is found. World premiere The play had its world premiere in Sydney in 1941. It was the first presentation from Whitehall Productions, a new theatrical company established by Coppel and Kathleen Robinson. The profits from the season went to the Red Cross. The original cast was: *Nigel Lovell as Rex Albion *Harvey Adams as Detective Inspector Ashley *Catherine Duncan as Judith Dyer *Charles Zoli as Cossage, the porter *Richard Parry as Sir Randolph Towle, chief commissioner of police *Leslie Victor as the family lawyer Mr Gruppy *Grant McIntyre as Walter *Charles MeCallum as Mr. Justice Abercorn *Frederick MoMahon as Detective Farr *John MacDougall as Richards *Phil Smith as Mr Hymie William Constable did the design. The Sydney Morning Herald reviewer said those who found I Killed the Count \\"such a soundly- constructed and Ingenious murder mystery will find much to entertain them in his latest offering, despite its weakness and it¬´ lack of sustained Interest... The first act drags, and the second loses its necessary punch and development of tension because its couise of drama Is too often Impeded by comic interference. \\" The Daily Telegraph called it \\"delightful entertainment.\\" Nonetheless the play was a popular success. The play was revived at the Minerva in August 1941 for a three-week run with Ron Randell in the lead role and Muriel Steinbeck in the lone female part. The Sydney Morning Herald theatre critic said Randell \\"failed to explore the subtle aspects of the playwrights study of a criminal exhibitionist.\\" Radio adaptation The play was performed on radio on the ABC in May 1941. Max Afford did the adaptation and the original cast reprised their roles. The play also inspired a song by Sefton Daly which was recorded by Coppel's then-fianc√©e Myra. English production The play was produced in England in 1947 under the title Strange as it May Seem. Production Film rights were bought by Vandyke Productions, a short-lived production company founded by brothers Roger and Nigel Proudlock that specialised in low budget pictures. Coppel made some changes to the play in adapting it including adding another female part. The film was shot at Nettlefold Studios, Walton-on-Thames in Surrey.

The book was released on August 18, 2009. It debuted at #10 on the Times bestseller list. The book, though at essence a thriller, contains numerous fantasy or science fiction elements and balances references to numerology and magic with ones to probability- and string theory. The story itself is set in a contemporary or near future setting. This reality is however linked to a parallel universe that seems to be a latter day incarnation of Goodkind's The Sword of Truth setting. The story revolves around the character of Alexander Rahl, an artist, whose life becomes increasingly complicated when he meets a woman named Jax who claims to have come from the other world. Plot summary Alexander Rahl (Alex for short) is a struggling artist, living in Orden, Nebraska. His mother is committed to an asylum for violent tendencies and schizophrenia; she often claims that people are watching her through mirrors. His father died in an accident when he was young. His only other family is a grandfather named Ben, a peace-loving former special forces soldier. Alex is en route to the local art gallery that carries his work when he meets a young woman named Jax. He is instantly fascinated with her, and saves her from a runaway truck when it nearly runs the two of them down on a street corner. Jax accompanies Alex to the gallery where she compliments him on a painting of a mountain clearing with nine trees. At the gallery, the owner urges Alex to paint more dystopian themes, like the best- selling artist at the gallery (named R.C. Dillon). Alex refuses, proclaiming that he only likes to paint real life. Alex resolves to give the painting of the mountain clearing to Jax, but before he can do so Jax disappears. On his 27th birthday, Ben gives Alex a packet of papers and explains that it is an inheritance that passes to the oldest member of Alex's bloodline. It would have passed to his mother, but she was committed soon after her 27th birthday and so the inheritance passes to Alex. The inheritance is a huge swath of land in the far east part of the country in a heavily wooded and mountainous nature preserve. If he so chooses, he can sell it to the \\"Daggett Trust\\", which controls the rest of the nature preserve. Ben urges Alex to sell the land and live handsomely for the rest of his life on the profits. Alex agrees to think about it, and leaves. As Alex returns to the gallery, he comes across Jax again and his adventure truly begins. Jax tries to convince Alex of the truth of her story. They discuss the meaning of the name Alexander: Saviour of Men, in relation to a prophecy stating that Alex will have to save another world; the world Jax comes from. As events unfold that open Alex' mind to all the implications Jax' story has, if true, he becomes mixed up in a battle between worlds and a massive conspiracy that he must unravel in order to save not only his own life. Alex decides to trust Jax, leading him into the adventure of a lifetime. Relation with the Sword of Truth series When in 2007 Terry Goodkind finished his Sword of Truth series with Confessor he announced his next work The Law of Nine as \\"a whole new kind of high-octane thriller\\" and a parting from the fantasy genre. However upon its publication it became obvious that there were parallels and references to be drawn between this new book and his previous series: * As the story progresses Jax states that she is an Amnell, which can lead to the assumption that she may also be a Confessor. Early in the book, before the revelation of her last name, Jax claims that queens used to bow to those of her kind, which in the Sword of Truth universe is true of Confessors. Jax however refers to herself as being a sorceress. * There is a reference to a journey book that Jax uses and compares it to a cell phone. The same kind of journey book that the Sisters of the Light use. * Reference is made to a historical/legendary leader known only as The Lord Rahl and a tale of how he created a new world without magic. Richard Rahl created such a world at the end of Confessor. Jennsen Rahl, his half-sister, willingly went to live here. Which would account for the presence of the Rahl line in this new world and could be interpreted to mean that Alex is a direct descendant of Jennsen Rahl. * The land surrounding Alex's inheritance is controlled by the \\"Dagget Trust\\". When the character of Jensen Rahl was first introduced in The Pillars of Creation her name was Jennsen Dagget. * Alex has several mannerisms, such as checking that his gun is loose in its holster, that mirror mannerisms Richard possesses in the Sword of Truth novels. * There is a scene in which Jax and Alex walk into a shop that has everything to do with wizards and witches and fantasy. In that shop, Jax's eyes find a figurine of a woman with a long white dress that has a square neckline. This figure is identified by the storekeeper as \\"Woman of Mystery\\"; a woman feared, hated, respected and perceived as a figure of mercy and kindness throughout history. Such a description does match the duality of a Confessor and the dress suggest that this mysterious figurine is not just a Confessor, but in fact a Mother Confessor, as was Kahlan Amnell. * The title of the book, Law of Nines, is referenced in Terry Goodkind's subsequent book, The Omen Machine. At one point, First Wizard Zedd says \\"Nine is an important trigger element. It links a number of laws of magic that have powerful influence over events. Threes are elemental in magic. Among other things, they are used in proofing magic. Threes construct nines‚Äî three threes make nine. They give nines power, help make them a Creative element.\\" * Alex being watched through the mirrors is exactly what happens in The Omen Machine to Richard and Kahlan. \\"Zedd lifted an eyebrow and fixed the man in the meaningful gaze. ‚ÄúThere are those, I hear tell, who have the ability to use dark forms of magic to gaze through mirrors into another place.‚Äù\\" * The place Alex lives is Orden, Nebraska. One might recall the Boxes of Orden from the Sword of Truth Series. Reception Tina Jordan of Entertainment Weekly expected the book to appeal to both fantasy and thriller fans alike. She predicted that if a sequel is written it will, however, take place in a fantasy setting. Lindsey Losnedahl of the Las Vegas Review-Journal claimed that the book is more a sequel to the Sword of Truth series than a completely new direction. \\"But I‚Äôm still waiting to see what Goodkind can do outside of the Rahl world, maybe 'The Law of Nines' is just a small step in getting there.\\" External links * The Law of Nines terrygoodkind.com References Category:Novels by Terry Goodkind Category:2009 American novels Category:Novels about artists Category:Novels set in Nebraska ","title":"The Law of Nines"},{"id":"24166246","text":"Song of Paris (known in the U.S. as Bachelor in Paris) is a 1952 British comedy film directed by John Guillermin and starring Dennis Price, Anne Vernon and Hermione Baddeley.

It is designated as a scheduled monument. History Little Cumbrae was recorded as Kumbrey circa 1300, Cumbraye circa 1330 and Litill Comeray in 1515.Johnston, Page 93 The present small square castle of Little or Lesser Cumbrae was built by Lord Eglinton in the 16th century, possibly as a base to prevent deer and rabbit poaching; both animals being very common on the main island of Little Cumbrae at the time.Haswell-SmithFullarton, Page 25 The Hunters of Hunterston were for centuries the Hereditary Foresters of the island and King's lands of Little Cumbrae,Dobie, Page 191 however Hugh, Earl of Eglinton was made keeper of the island in 1515 because the Privy Council believed that Robert Hunter did not have the means to ...resist ye personis yat waistis the samyn without suple and help.MacGibbon, Page 182 This arrangement lasted for fifteen years and in 1527 Robert Hunter obtained a 'Royal Charter of the Island', but soon after the Crown sold it to the Earl of Eglinton, who in 1555 had his rights confirmed by James V.Fullarton, Page 154Steele, Page iii Walter Stewart (1293‚Äì1326), who had married Marjorie Bruce, daughter of King Robert the Bruce, may have previously built a castle or hunting lodge here and his son, Robert II spent time here hunting the deer, however no local traditions about the site of the old castle have survived. The \\"Auld Castle\\" was occupied during hunting expeditions by Robert II in 1375 and 1384.Lytteil, Page 132Steele, Page ii King Robert III also visited Little Cumbrae Castle. The proposed harbour Robert Boyd of Badinhaith or Badenheath in Stirlingshire was the second son of Robert Boyd, 5th Lord Boyd and in 1599 resided in the castleDownie, Page 49 and planned to encourage trade by building a harbour going so far as to obtain materials for the work, however at that time a number of families lived on Little Cumbrae and principle amongst them were several Montgomerys who did not wish to improve communications with the outside world. The island was at that time a refuge for \\"rebels, fugitives and ex-communicates\\"Downie, Page 50 and the upshot was that the Montgomerys led some thirty men who broke down the doors to the castle, destroyed the materials intended for the harbour and smashed up the furniture, ousting Robert Boyd and occupying the castle. They seem to have escaped punishment and even given succour to other malefactors. The small harbour at the Brigurd Point on the Hunterston SandsRCAHMS is said to have been used by the lairds for their journeys, etc to Little Cumbrae. Cromwell and King Charles II Little Cumbrae Castle. In Cromwell's time the then Earl of Eglinton dispatched his wife with a garrison of forty men at arms to this fortlet castle for her safe keeping; the defences were strengthened at this juncture. The Earl was taken prisoner after fighting against Cromwell at the Battle of Worcester (3 September 1651) and Lady Montgomerie was advised by the Marquis of Argyll to either offer the castle to the authorities or have it demolished once the munitions and cannons had been safely removed.Fullarton, Pages 27 - 28 Steele has it that the Earl himself took refuge at the castle when Cromwell's troops threatened Ardrossan Castle. Principal Baillie of Glasgow fled here when Cromwell approached the city, leaving his family and belongings behind and lodging with Lady Montgomerie.Fullarton, Page 28 Archibald Hamilton was a friend and correspondent of Oliver Cromwell and was imprisoned in the dungeon at Little Cumbrae castle by the 6th Earl of Eglinton (died 1661) before being taken to Stirling where he was hanged. The old Statistical Account indicates that this fortlet was taken by surprise and destroyed by Cromwellian forces, possibly in revenge for the role the castle played in the fate of Archibald Hamilton; after this it does not appear to have been restored or tenanted. The inaccessibility of Little Cumbrae made it the principal stronghold of the Earl of Eglinton as Ardrossan Castle was vulnerable to artillery. In 1651 Charles II permitted: It is our pleasure the number of fortie men which the Lord Montgomerie hath raised and doeth maintaine in at the Isle of Comrie, may be allowed to him in this new levie for so many out of his owne or his fathers proper lands.Caldwell, Page 220 Little Cumbrae Castle and island from Millport. In 1609 Robert Hunter was the subject of a complaint to the Privy Council made by the Captain of Dumbarton Castle for going to Little Cumbrae and taking all of the hawks away. The name Cumbrae may derive from the Cymri or Kymry meaning 'fellow countrymen' or from Kil Maura meaning 'cell or church of a female saint'. Modern history The Normans introduced the rabbit to Scotland from Europe for their meat and fur; at first they were scarce and valuable as a novelty and they made good eating. They were either kept in warrens within stone walls or confined and protected on small islands, such as on Little Cumbrae.McNaught No contemporary Anglo-Saxon or Celtic word for rabbit therefore exists and no mention is made of them in the Domesday Book of 1086, also 'conyngis' (Scots) or 'coneys' was originally the name used for adults and the term 'rabbits' was only applied to the young. The 6th Earl was a very keen huntsman and estate correspondence shows that he may have introduced deer from Ireland to Little Cumbrae in order to improve the stock.Fullarton, Page 164 The 15th Earl, George Montgomerie, introduced rabbits again in the 1850s and these bred so well as to become a pest. 5000 rabbits were being bred each year and the Earl rented out Little Cumbrae to shooting parties which provided a worthwhile income. Architecture The floorplan of Little Cumbrae Castle. This Category A listed building is strikingly similar to Fairlie Castle, Law and Skelmorlie Castles. The vaulted great hall was on the first floor, together with the kitchen, which were modern by the standards of the day. The entrance was via the first floor, an entrance to the ground floor being an apparent afterthought. The castle had two vaulted cellars. The tower had a typical continuous course of chequered corbelling and round angle turrets at three of the four corners.MacGibbon, Pages 177 - 8 In 1568 George Elphinstoun, glasswright, was employed by the Earl of Eglinton to put glass windows into this 'Castle of Cumbrae'. Tranter states that the castle (NS 152 513) was once surrounded by a rampart and ditch, and gives the date of the tower house as early 15th century.

Construction and commissioning ARD-20 was laid down on 20 December 1943 by the Pacific Bridge Company at Alameda, California, and was launched early in 1944. She was placed in service on 31 March 1944 with Lieutenant Commander Gutav Jones, USNR, as officer-in-charge.  First period in service, 1944‚Äì1947  After training at the Drydock Training Center at Tiburon, California, ARD-20 departed San Francisco Bay on 11 June 1944 under tow by the merchant ship SS Stratford Point. She stopped briefly at Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides Islands before arriving at her assigned base, Seeadler Harbor, at Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands, on 12 August 1944. As a unit of the United States Seventh Fleet's Service Squadron 3, ARD-20 repaired battle-damaged ships at Manus for the next eight months. On 16 April 1945, the auxiliary fleet tug USS ATA-170 towed ARD-20 out of Seeadler Harbor and set a course for Morotai Island, located just north of Halmahera in the northern Molucca Islands. The two vessels arrived at Morotai on 29 April 1945. ARD-20 conducted repairs at Morotai until 24 July 1945, when she was towed to the repair base at Manicani Island, located near Samar in the Philippine Islands, where she spent 19 months. ARD-20 departed Manicani on 25 February 1947, under tow by the merchant ship SS Robert Eden, and arrived in Apra Harbor, Guam, on 9 March 1947. Later in 1946, the merchant ship SS Robert Hartley towed her by way of Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, to San Pedro, California, where the two vessels arrived on 11 September 1947. ARD-20 was placed out of service on 7 October 1947 and berthed with the San Pedro Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet.  Second period in service, 1966‚Äì1974  Eighteen years later, in October 1965, ARD-20 was moved to the Long Beach Naval Shipyard at Terminal Island, California, where work began on her modernization and conversion into a bathyscaphe support ship. Reclassified as a bathyscaphe support auxiliary repair dock (ARD(BS)), she was placed in service on 14 September 1966 as USS ARD(BS)-20 and assigned to the Submarine Force, United States Pacific Fleet, to conduct Chief of Naval Operations-sponsored research projects related to deep submergence vehicles and their operation. On 9 March 1968, ARD(BS)-20 was named USS White Sands, and her hull designation was shortened back to ARD-20. From 1968, White Sands conducted tests with the bathyscaphe Trieste II in various open ocean environments. Those tests took place near the Undersea Weapons Center near San Clemente Island off California. The White Sands also participated in the recovery of a KH-9 Hexagon payload lost at sea.http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/32000249 USS White Sands, carrying the bathyscaphe Trieste II, moored behind the fleet ocean tug USS Apache (ATF-67) at the Panama Canal Zone ca. 28 February 1969. Apache was towing White Sands to the Atlantic to search for the sunken nuclear submarine USS Scorpion (SSN-589) off the Azores.In February 1969, White Sands, carrying Trieste II, departed the United States West Coast, towed by the fleet ocean tug USS Apache (ATF-67) to participate in the search for the nuclear submarine USS Scorpion (SSN-589)‚Äîwhich had been lost in the Atlantic Ocean near the Azores in 1968‚Äîemploying Trieste II and supported by Apache and the high-speed transport USS Ruchamkin (APD-89). White Sands concluded her part in the Scorpion assignment early in August 1969 and was towed, via the Panama Canal, to San Diego, California, where she arrived on 7 October 1969. At San Diego, White Sands resumed her research assignment with deep submergence vehicles. On 1 August 1973, she was reclassified an auxiliary deep submergence support ship and redesignated AGDS-1. Final disposition Late in the summer of 1974, White Sands was placed out of service. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register in September 1974, and she was to be sold for scrapping. Instead, she was purchased by Seattle-based Marine Power and Equipment to be used in the construction of barges for the US Navy. The company elected to move her into Seattle's Lake Union, where she would then be used as a permanent dry dock in fresh water. USS White Sands traversing Seattle's Ballard Locks on her side, 4 October 1975. To reach her permanent home, however, required passing through the 80-foot wide Hiram Chittenden Locks in Ballard - a difficult accomplishment for a vessel with an 81-foot beam. In cooperation with the US Army Corps of Engineers, operators of the locks, a plan was devised to turn the White Sands partially on her side and then send her through. To accomplish this, one side of the ship was ballasted with water and weighted down with 51 concrete blocks and 17 stacks of steel plates, weighing almost 1226 short tons, while the other side - raised 38 degrees in the air - was supported by two air-filled barges cabled to the ship's superstructure. Adding to the difficulty of this engineering feat, it was determined that the passage could only be attempted at the highest tide. Should the ship be delayed for a few moments, her bottom would no longer clear the side of the locks. Attempting such a transit was incredibly risky: even today, they carry a substantial amount of commercial traffic. Had the tide subsided before she completed the transit, engineers had already decided there was only one other option: quickly cut her into pieces and scrap her. A first attempt failed when one of the supporting barges broke free and shot across the canal. The barge was retrieved and reattached, and on the following day, 4 October 1975, the second attempt was a success. She was gently pulled into position in the locks by tugboats, and transited the locks at high tide. The White Sands remains the largest vessel ever to transit the Ballard Locks, and is still in use as a dry dock at Lake Union Drydock Co. in Seattle, WA. She is visible on maps of Lake Union, in the southeast corner of the lake. She remains largely intact; only the front part of her superstructure has been cut off so she can sit flush with her moorings.

It was based on the 1955 play of the same title by Philip Mackie. It was made at Walton Studios with some brief location shooting in France. The film's sets were designed by the art director Anthony Masters. Plot While making a film on the French Riviera, the producer Max Poulton has been having an affair with his star, Gina Bertini. A married man, Max does not want to lose his wife Carol, but the hot-tempered Gina threatens to tell all. Max comes home with a blood stain on his shirt cuff. A visit follows from an Inspector Carliss of Scotland Yard, who says Gina's body has just been found, stabbed to death. Rushing to the house where he and Gina used to secretly meet, Max gathers up possessions he's left behind. A neighbor spots his car. Upon returning home, to a party Carol is hosting, Max is astounded to find Gina alive and well among the guests. Confused, he drives her home, leaves her in the car briefly, then returns to find her lifeless body, once again stabbed. Max thinks he must be losing his mind. This time a local police official, Inspector Simon, comes to call. The only conclusion Max can draw is that Carliss is somehow trying to frame him. His suspicions are correct. Carliss is not a Scotland Yard inspector at all but Gina's jealous ex-husband. He has arranged things to make Max appear guilty, and Simon, having the neighbor's eyewitness description of seeing Max's car, has little choice but to place Max under arrest. When it looks as though Carliss intends to harm Carol as well, Max escapes from jail. He manipulates Carliss into stealing his own car, and when the police give chase to the wrong man, Carliss, in a panic, drives off a cliff to his death. Max's innocence becomes apparent to the police.

Plot  Young teenager Agnes, her retired widower father, and their caretaker Karen, live in an old house on the Brittany coast in France. Agnes, who is immature and perhaps backward, has been removed from school and lives an isolated and childlike life. While walking home from church, they witness a prison bus crash. The convicts attempt to flee and are shot at by the guards. One knocks down a guard and injures him before escaping. Agnes finds the convict in their shed: in her imagination, she thinks that she has created him from a scarecrow and belongs to her: she does not tell the police about him. The family hide him and he stays for a while. The gendarme dies and the police believe the family know something about the fugitive. He and Karen become close but Agnes catches them kissing and attacks Karen, who leaves. The fugitive leaves separately, refusing to go with Karen, but Agnes follows him and he brings her home. A relationship develops and, after, her father objects, they leave together for a town. However, she struggles to manage a household and returns home. The police question her about her absence. She says nothing but the fugitive, following her home, is seen, chased and killed.  Cast  * Melvyn Douglas as Frederick Larbaud * Patricia Gozzi as Agnes Larbaud * Dean Stockwell as Joseph * Gunnel Lindblom as Karen Production Development The film was based on the novel Rapture in My Rags published in 1954.

The book became a best seller in England. In 1957 film rights were bought by Andre Hakim the son in law of Daryl F. Zanuck of 20th Century Fox, where Hakim had a production deal. Hakim beat out Carol Reed and Hecht Hill Lancaster who both wanted the novel. She said he wanted Audrey Hepburn and Yul Brynner to play the lead.Hakim in Rapture Over 'Rapture' The Washington Post and Times Herald 15 Apr 1957: A10. In March 1963 Daryl F.

Serge Bourguignon, who had directed Rozzi in Sundays and Cybele later said Zanuck wanted him to direct the film \\"but I didn't want to do it. He said, \\"Well, you can do it with the same style,\\" but I refused. So they hired Guillermin, who is a very good director, but Patricia didn't get along with him at all.

It was destroyed in the 1929 Palestine riots but was rebuilt in 1930. In 1948 it was abandoned again. Hartuv was the starting point for the Convoy of 35 during the 1948 war. Hartuv is now an industrial zone near Beit Shemesh. History Har-Tuv colony (1895‚Äì1929) In the early 1870s, the Spanish consul in Jerusalem bought over 5,000 dunams of land from the villagers of Artuf, which he sold to the London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews. Jerusalem and its environs: Quarters, neighborhoods, villages, 1800-1948, Ruth Kark, Michal Oren-Nordheim After the pogroms against the Jews in Eastern Europe in 1882, the society used some of the money raised to help the Jewish refugees to purchase land in Artuf. Towards the end of 1883, 24 Jewish families were settled there, each receiving 150 dunams of farmland, farm animals and tools. Due to economic difficulties and the lack of water, some of the land was leased to Arabs. After living for some time in tents, a wooden hut was built where all the families lived together. They were obliged to attend Sunday meetings and send their children to the missionary school, but most of the colonists remained practicing Jews. In 1895, the Bulgarian Hibbat Zion movement bought the 5,000-dunam farm from the London Jews Society and renamed it Har-Tuv (lit. Mountain of Good). Twelve Jewish families settled there and tried to earn a living from agriculture. Due to the poor quality of the soil, and lack of water, seeds and work implements, life in Hartuv was a struggle. In 1900, one of the settlers inaugurated a carriage service to Jerusalem.Ruth Kark, Jerusalem and its Environs In his 1912-13 literary almanac, Luah le'eretz yisrael, historian Abraham Moses Luncz wrote: \\"Artuf (Har-Tuv), founded in 1895, about 10 minutes from D'ieban along the route of the Jerusalem-Yafo railroad, 101 inhabitants, Sephardi Jews of Bulgarian origin.\\" \\"Remembering Har-Tuv,\\" Avraham B.

According to a census conducted in 1931 by the British Mandate authorities, Har Tuv had a population of 107 inhabitants, in 24 inhabited houses.Mills, 1932, p. 39 On 20 December 1947, a Notrim truck on its way to Hartuv was attacked and its 3 passengers murdered. Since then all transportation was done in lightly armored vehicles. On March 18, 1948 a convoy that had just finished resupplying Hartuv was ambushed on its way back to Jerusalem by the forces of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni. 11 convoy members were killed in the battle.Levi, Yitzhak, \\"Tisha Kabin\\" (9 Measures) (Jerusalem in the War of Independence, (in Hebrew) Maarachot - IDF, Israel Ministry of Defense, 1986, p. 443 The Convoy of 35 left Hartuv in an attempt to resupply and reinforce the Gush Etzion kibbutzim by foot on January 16, 1948. 35 members of the convoy were killed.Arieh O'Sullivan, A Magnificent Disaster, Jerusalem Post, Jan 16, 1998 Road to Har Tuv joins the main road to Jerusalem, 1948 Moshav Naham Monument commemorating the founders of Hartuv After the establishment of the State of Israel, a ma'abara transit camp was set up to accommodate the masses of new immigrants arriving from Europe and Arab lands. In 1950, Moshav Naham was founded nearby. Archaeology Two archaeological sites nearby are Khirbat Marmita, about 1 km east of the village, and al-Burj, on the site of Hartuv to the southwest. Excavations have been carried out on Khirbat al-Burj by the Hebrew University since 1985. Excavations in Hartuv revealed an architectural complex dating to the Early Bronze 1 period. The site includes a central courtyard surrounded by rooms on at least three sides. One of the rooms, a rectangular hall with pillar bases along its long axis, may have been a sanctuary with a line of standing stones (massebot). Another hall has a monumental entrance flanked by two monolithic doorjambs.

Cohen says the studio decided to make the movie, built a fort and town in Almeria, Spain, then decided they disliked the script; they paid Cohen to travel to Spain and write a new film around the existing sets. Cohen wrote a script they were happy with, and Jim Brown and Lee Van Cleef were cast. According to Cohen, Van Cleef then changed his mind about doing the film on the advice of Alberto Grimaldi who said the actor's character was ridiculous; Cohen persuaded van Cleef to do it, arguing it was a comic role along the lines of Humphrey Bogart's character in The African Queen.

It is the oldest continually running genre festival in Los Angeles, California. It is held in October at Raleigh Studios on Melrose Boulevard in the Charlie Chaplin Theatre. The festival was founded by actress Denise Gossett with her partner Kimberlee Beeson. Gossett came up with the idea after starring in the horror film Chain of Souls. She realized there was a scarcity of film festivals and competitions for the horror genre. She and Beeson created Shriekfest in the hopes that young and upcoming filmmakers and screenwriters would find in it an outlet for their talent. Their partnership lasted until 2003, after which time Todd Beeson became the new partner in the festival. Shriekfest awards multiple prizes for horror films and screenplays. It also awards films in the science fiction, fantasy, and thriller categories. Prizes include trophies, as well as cash, product awards, and publicity. The festival also has an under-18 category open to young filmmakers and screenwriters. Shriekfest went green in 2010 and now accepts screenplays and films via email. Awards Shriekfest awards can vary from year to year at judges' requests and have included the following categories.

She agreed to return home to make the movie and help the film be classified as Canadian. Nelligan later called the movie a nightmre, saying in 1983 that \\"The Canadian film industry is a joke, and we Canadians should be ashamed of it. We passed a silly law to keep out American film professionals, from whom we might have learned something, and to assure that every incompetent film person in Canada could have a job. What we got were horribly incompetent people in top jobs, drunk most of the time, who went to Hollywood and got completely taken in by every agent in town, and in turn screwed every dentist in Canada out of $5,000 in tax-shelter investments.

It was released theatrically in Europe then re-cut and sold to television in North America. An article in the Toronto Star from 2001 said \\"This notable dud was a product of Canada's notorious tax- shelter era when movies were for business write-offs rather than any creative imperative. Shot in Vancouver, it never lets the audience know where we are. A feeble echo of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, the movie had a British director (John Guillermin) and an American star (James Coburn). The screenwriter took his name off it after a dispute with producer Bill Marshall (one of the festival's founders). The movie had a gala slot at the 1980 festival, followed by a quick burial.\\"Hidden gems and festival misses ; Lots of hype doesn't guarantee a hit at the Toronto film festival, where movies with little fanfare have made it big: [Ontario Edition] Knelman, Martin.

He was killed by a single enemy gunshot on August 13, 2009, while on active duty in Afghanistan as a U.S. Marines Reservist. Early life William John Cahir was born in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania and sergeant in the Marine Corps Reserve's 4th Civil Affairs Group, headquartered in Washington, D.C., a unit that specializes in civil- military operations. Former Assistant U.S. Secretary of Defense Paul McHale described Cahir's military job as \\"a community organizer while carrying a pack and a rifle.\\" In the 1990s, Cahir had worked for the Southampton Press and Education Daily newspapers, as well as for the United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions under Sen. Kennedy. He had also previously worked for former Senator Harris Wofford (D-Penn.). In 2005, he was named one of \\"Pennsylvania's Most Influential Reporters\\" by the Pennsylvania political news website PoliticsPA. Cahir had previously also deployed to Iraq as a Marine reservist, serving in Ramadi August 2004 - March 2005; and in Fallujah September 2006 - April 2007. In January 2008, Cahir resigned from his journalism job to run for Congress in Pennsylvania's 5th congressional district, which included his hometown of State College. He came in second in the Democratic primary, earning 34.9 percent of the vote. A television campaign commercial humorously depicted the challenge of pronouncing his name ‚Äúcare.‚Äù He was deployed to Afghanistan in May 2009. Prior to his deployment, he had been working for consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton. Cahir graduated from Penn State University in 1990 with a degree in English. He married his wife, Ren√© E. Browne in 2006. At the time of his death, she was pregnant with twin girls and she was due in December 2009. Death Cahir was killed during Eastern Resolve II, a pre-dawn offensive operation in Helmand Province's Now Zad district. Much of the August 12, 2009 operation focused on controlling the Taliban-held town of Dananeh. Once a city of 30,000, more than three years of fighting had previously reduced the town‚Äôs population to an estimated 2,000. Eastern Resolve II involved approximately 400 U.S. Marines and 100 Afghan troops and was intended to cut militant trade and supply lines, and to allow local residents to vote in the August 20 2009 Afghan presidential election. According to a family spokesperson, Cahir was shot in the neck while Marines entering the town encountered machine gun and small arms fire. The Associated Press also reported that fighting in Dananeh lasted more than eight hours, but that, by late morning, Marines prepared to conduct the first-ever NATO patrol in Marine-controlled portions of the town, in order to \\"reach out to civilians possibly huddled in their homes as sporadic but fierce outbursts of intense gunfire continued ...\\". Cahir was working as a Washington, D.C.-based correspondent for Newhouse News Service when he notably joined the Marines in November 2003 at age 34‚Äîa move that required requesting an exception to the service's age-restrictions. He cited a long-held interest in military service as well as the September 11 attacks as motivations for his enlistment and subsequently wrote a first-person essay regarding his boot camp experience. His military awards included the Bronze Star Medal for his service in Afghanistan, three Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals, and two Combat Action Ribbons. He was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart in September 2009. A memorial fund was established to pay for the family‚Äôs needs at Bill Cahir Memorial Fund, Box 268, Alexandria, Virginia 22313.

The Act also required makers or dealers in watches and clocks to purchase an annual license, costing 2s. 6d. in London and 1 shilling elsewhere. However, the tax was a failure. It nearly ruined the manufacturers of clocks and watches, with demand for their products declining to such an extent that within a year the manufacture of these items diminished by half. It also caused thousands of workers employed in these trades to emigrate. Consequently, Pitt repealed the tax in April 1798.Dowell, p. 275.

Plot  Marine scientists prepare to leave their underwater Oceanlab after an extended stay performing oceanographic research. An underwater earthquake interrupts their plans. Dr. Andrews (Walter Pidgeon) enlists experimental sub captain Adrien Blake (Ben Gazzara) to survey the damage and rescue the oceanauts. He brings along Chief Diver \\"Mack\\" MacKay (Ernest Borgnine) and Dr. Leah Jansen (Yvette Mimieux), fianc√©e of one of the scientists. Blake finds the lab has been ripped from its moorings and has tumbled down an unexplored, deep ocean trench, presumably intact. With the lab's reserve air supply dwindling, the team descends into the unexplored trench and finds an incredible ecosystem populated with monstrously oversized fish. After surviving encounters with unfriendly denizens, they find the lab partially intact, the surviving scientists breathing from scuba tanks and fending off giant, hungry eels. Diver Moulton sacrifices his life distracting the eels in order to enable the others to be rescued. The submarine returns to the surface with the two rescued scientists.

The Langenberg summit is about 10 m southwest of the Hessian-Westphalian state border. The Langenberg‚Äôs neighbouring peaks include the Hoppernkopf () to the north, the Mittelsberg (801 m) to the east, the Hegekopf (842.9 m) to the east-southeast, the Hopperkopf (832.3 m) to the southeast, the Clemensberg (839.2 m) to the south-southwest and Auf dem Sternrodt (789.4 m) to the west. The Burbecke stream emerges west of the Langenberg and the Raken on its northern flank, both within the catchment area of the Gierskoppbach. The Langenberg is passed to the east in a south-north direction by the upper reaches of the Hoppecke, into which a small brook runs that comes out of a valley - Der Keller (\\"The Cellar\\") - on the southeast side of the mountain.

Canada is the world's largest exporter of uranium, and has the world's second largest proven reserves. Canada also exports nuclear technology within the terms of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, to which it is a signatory, and is the world's largest producer of radioactive medical isotopes. History Nuclear technology The Nuclear industry (as distinct from the uranium industry) in Canada dates back to 1942 when a joint British-Canadian laboratory was set up in Montreal, Quebec, under the administration of the National Research Council of Canada, to develop a design for a heavy-water nuclear reactor. This reactor was called National Research Experimental and would be the most powerful research reactor in the world when completed. In the meantime, in 1944, approval was given to proceed with the construction of the smaller ZEEP (Zero Energy Experimental Pile) test reactor at Chalk River, Ontario and on September 5, 1945 at 3:45 p.m., the 10 Watt ZEEP successfully achieved the first self-sustained nuclear reaction outside the United States. ZEEP operated for 25 years as a key research facility. In 1946, Montreal Laboratory was closed, and the work continued at Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories. Building partly on the experimental data obtained from ZEEP, the National Research Experimental (NRX)‚Äîa natural uranium, heavy water moderated research reactor‚Äîstarted up on July 22, 1947. It operated for 43 years, producing radioisotopes, undertaking fuels and materials development work for CANDU reactors, and providing neutrons for physics experiments. It was eventually joined in 1957 by the larger 200 megawatt (MW) National Research Universal reactor (NRU). In 1952, the Canadian Government formed AECL, a Crown corporation with the mandate to develop peaceful uses of nuclear energy. A partnership was formed between AECL, Ontario Hydro and Canadian General Electric to build Canada's first nuclear power plant, called NPD for Nuclear Power Demonstration. The 20 MWe Nuclear Power Demonstration (NPD) started operation in 1962 and successfully demonstrated the unique concepts of on-power refuelling using natural uranium fuel, and heavy wa ter moderator and coolant. These defining features formed the basis of a successful fleet of CANDU power reactors (CANDU is an acronym for CANada Deuterium Uranium) built and operated in Canada and elsewhere. In the late 1960s (1967‚Äì1970), Canada also developed an experimental miniature nuclear reactor named SLOWPOKE (acronym for Safe Low-Power Kritical Experiment). The first prototype was built at Chalk River and many SLOWPOKEs were subsequently built, mainly for research. This reactor design is extremely safe and requires almost no maintenance (it is even licensed to operate unattended overnight); it can run for more than 20 years before the nuclear fuel needs replacement. There was an attempt at commercializing the reactor, as it could be used in remote areas or vehicles (research stations, electric-diesel submarines). Then, China entered the market with its SLOWPOKE-like reactor and thus, the project lost its commercial potential. Many SLOWPOKEs are still in use in Canada; there is one running at √âcole Polytechnique de Montr√©al, for instance. Radioisotopes The existence of Canada's early nuclear program, and in particular the powerful NRX research reactor, nurtured a medical isotope and nuclear medicine R&D; community at several locations across the country. Canada pioneered the cobalt-60 cancer therapy technology that became standard medical practice throughout the world (the first cobalt-60 cancer therapy was administered at the Royal Victoria Hospital in London, Ontario on October 27, 1951), and has also been involved in the development of accelerator-based cancer therapy technology. Framework Natural Resources Canada oversees nuclear power R&D; and regulation in Canada, with responsibility for the crown corporation Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) and the regulatory agency, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC). AECL‚Äôs commercial operations include reactor development, design and construction of CANDU nuclear reactors, and provision of reactor services and technical support to CANDU reactors worldwide. Power generation The province of Ontario dominates Canada's nuclear power industry, containing most of the country's nuclear power generating capacity. Ontario has 16 operating reactors providing about 50% of the province‚Äôs electricity, plus two reactors undergoing refurbishment. New Brunswick also has one reactor. Overall, nuclear power provides about 15% of Canada's electricity.About Hydroelectric Energy The industry employs about 21,000 people directly and 10,000 indirectly. There has been renewed interest in nuclear energy, spurred by increasing demand (particularly within Ontario), and the desire to comply with Canada‚Äôs Kyoto Agreement obligations, although Canada withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol in December 2012. (Canada was committed to cutting its greenhouse emissions to 6% below 1990 levels by 2012, but in 2009 emissions were 17% higher than in 1990. The Harper government prioritized oil sands development in Alberta, and deprioritized improving the environment.) []. The Government of Ontario proposed plans in 2004 to build several new nuclear reactors in the province. The leading candidate is AECL's Advanced CANDU Reactor. Environmental assessments are currently underway for one site next to Bruce Power's Bruce Nuclear Generating Station in Tiverton and another next to Ontario Power Generation's Darlington Nuclear Generating Station. Bruce Power has applied for a license to generate nuclear power at Cardinal Lake in the province of Alberta.Bruce Power buys assets of Energy Alberta Corp. Medical radioisotopes About 85% of the world's medical and industrial cobalt-60 is produced in Canada. The medical-use cobalt-60 is produced in the NRU research reactor at AECL's Chalk River Laboratories, while industrial-use cobalt-60 is produced in selected CANDU power reactors (in these units some adjuster rods are made of cobalt-59 for this purpose). Furthermore, over half the cobalt-60 therapy machines and medical sterilizers in the world were built in Canada, treating over half a million patients yearly. In addition to cobalt-60, MDS Nordion also produces radioisotopes that are essential in diagnostic therapy. Some can be mixed chemically with other substances and injected into the body to allow physicians to ‚Äúsee‚Äù into the body, even the brain, lungs and organs that hitherto were inaccessible. Not only have these diagnostic techniques eliminated the need for much exploratory surgery, they have provided physicians with diagnostic capabilities that would otherwise have been impossible. Mild irradiation is also used to sterilize many medical supplies and some pharmaceuticals. Canada was also a pioneer in the production of medical isotopes, and today is the world's biggest supplier of Molybdenum-99, the \\"workhorse\\" and most commonly used isotope in nuclear medicine. This isotope is generated in the NRU reactor; this is then shipped to MDS Nordion, a global supplier of radiopharmaceuticals based in Kanata, Ontario (near Ottawa). There are more than 4000 Mo-99 treatments daily in Canada, and 40,000 daily in the US. Canada produces about 30-40% of the global supply of molybdenum-99. Uranium production Canada is the world‚Äôs largest producer of uranium with about one third of world production coming from Saskatchewan mines. There are two major players in the uranium mining sector. Cameco operates the McArthur River mine, which started production at the end of 1999. Its ore is milled at Key Lake, which once contributed 15% of world uranium production but is now mined out. Its other former mainstay is Rabbit Lake mine, which still has some reserves at Eagle Point mine, where mining resumed in mid-2002 after a three-year break. An underground reserve replacement program is adding to reserves faster than they are being mined. Areva Resources Canada operates the McClean Lake mine, which started production in mid-1999. Its Cluff Lake mine has now closed, and is being decommissioned. In December 2004, the Cigar Lake Joint Venture (AREVA Resources Canada 37.1%, Cameco Corporation 50.025%, Idemitsu Uranium Exploration Canada Ltd. 7.875%, and TEPCO Resources 5%) partners agreed to proceed with development of the Cigar Lake uranium mine -the second largest known high-grade uranium deposit in the world, after McArthur River. With federal and provincial approvals in place, full construction began in January 2005. All of Canada's uranium production now comes from the high-grade unconformity-type uranium deposits of the Athabasca Basin of northern Saskatchewan, such as Rabbit Lake, McClean Lake, McArthur River, and Cigar Lake. The uranium industry invested at least CDN $3.5 billion during the 20th century, with capital investment in mines of CDN $2.5 billion, and exploration and predevelopment expenditures exceeding CDN $1 billion. Adjusting for inflation, there have been three investment booms. The first small one came with the initial developments in the Beaverlodge area in the 1950s. The second and largest boom was in the 1970s, with the opening of the Cluff and Rabbit lake mines, and the third was in the 1990s with the development of the higher grade ores on the east side. Nuclear waste management Radioactive waste in Canada can be grouped into three broad categories: nuclear fuel waste, low- level radioactive waste, and uranium mill tailings. The most recent inventory of these wastes is provided in the LLRWMO 2004 report.http://www.llrwmo.org/en/programs/ongoing/Inventory_Report_2004.pdf At the end of 2003, the total amount of nuclear fuel waste was 6,800 m3. Canada‚Äôs used nuclear fuel is now safely stored at licensed facilities at the reactor sites. On site storage options are expected to perform well over the near term; however, existing reactor sites were not chosen for their suitability as permanent storage sites. Furthermore, the communities hosting the nuclear reactors have a reasonable expectation that used nuclear fuel will eventually be moved. In 2002 the Government of Canada passed the Nuclear Fuel Waste Act, requiring the owners of used nuclear fuel to create the Canada's Nuclear Waste Management Organisation (NWMO). This Act required that the NWMO engage citizens, specialists, stakeholders and the Aboriginal peoples in research and dialogue to assess the options for long-term management of this material. In 2005, the NWMO recommended \\"Adaptive Phased Management\\" as the foundation for managing the risks and uncertainties that are inherent in the very long time frames over which used nuclear fuel must be managed.NWMO: Final Study Report (2005) In 2007, the Government of Canada approved this approach, and authorized NWMO to begin implementation.Natural Resources Canada News Room - News Release 2007-06-14 In summary the program commits Canada to the first steps to manage the used nuclear fuel it has created. It espouses sequential and collaborative decision-making to provide flexibility to adapt to experience and technical change. It aims to provide a viable, safe and secure long-term storage solution, with the potential of retrieving used fuel until and if and when a decision is made to seal the facility permanently. It is meant to provide the capacity to transfer responsibility from one generation to the next. The key technical element of the approach is the ultimate centralized containment and isolation of the used fuel and other high level waste in a deep geological repository in a suitable rock formation, such as the crystalline rock of the Canadian Shield or Ordovician sedimentary rock.

Although the aircraft itself was successful, its Shvetsov ASh-73TK engines were too unreliable for civilian use and were further needed to equip the Tupolev Tu-4 bomber, so it was cancelled in 1948. Development The Il-18 was developed to meet Aeroflot's need for a high-altitude, long-range aircraft to fly its long-haul national and international routes. It was conceived as a cantilever low-wing monoplane, powered by four Charomskii ACh-32 diesel engines, as initially used in the Ilyushin Il-12, with a tricycle landing gear. To improve the wing's lift-to- drag ratio and the aircraft's maximum speed, the wing was given a very high aspect ratio of 12. It was intended to operate from both paved and unpaved runways with a length of less than . Its main wheels were larger than normal to handle the rough surfaces. The pressurized fuselage was circular in cross- section, which provided room for cargo and baggage compartments under the cabin floor. A variety of seating plans were under consideration, ranging from 66 seats to 27 sleeping berths, but no decision had been made before it was canceled.Gordon, pp. 188‚Äì89 Before the Il-18 had made its first flight its engines were changed to the Shvetsov ASh-73TK radial piston engine because they were entering production, unlike the diesels.Gordon, p. 189 They drove four-blade AV-16NM-95 variable pitch propellers. Electro-thermal deicing boots were fitted on the leading edges of the wings, horizontal and vertical tail, driven by four engine-driven electric generators. A bleed air deicing system was fitted for the cockpit glazing and propeller blades. The first flight of the Il-18 was made on 18 August 1946, in a sixty-passenger configuration, even though the turbosuperchargers for its engines had not been fitted. To save time Sergey Ilyushin gave the order to commence flight tests without them. However, this proved to be in vain because the manufacturer's flight tests were not concluded until 30 July 1947 as the turbo-superchargers were not delivered in a timely manner. Other problems were the short time between overhauls for the ASh-73TKs, initially only 25 hours, and the disintegration of one engine on 25 June 1947. Flight characteristics were docile and the passenger cabin proved to be far more comfortable than those of the Lisunov Li-2, the C-47 Skytrain or the Il-12. It had a comfortable margin of power that allowed it to continue to cruise if one or even two engines weren't running. Its engines were in short supply as they were needed to power the Tupolev Tu-4 and they were not yet reliable enough for economical use so the aircraft was canceled.Gordon, pp. 190‚Äì91 The prototype was displayed at the 1947 air display at Tushino where it led a formation of Il-12 airliners. Later it was fitted with a towing shackle and used for flight tests of the heavy Ilyushin Il-32 glider, as it was one of the few aircraft available powerful enough to tow the glider.Gordon, p. 191 It was flown well into the early 1950s although its ultimate fate is unknown.Gordon, p. 191 Specifications See also References ;Notes ;Bibliography  * Il-018 (1947) Category:1940s Soviet airliners Category:Abandoned civil aircraft projects Category:Four- engined tractor aircraft Category:Low-wing aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1946 Category:Four-engined piston aircraft ","title":"Ilyushin Il-18 (1946)"},{"id":"24166761","text":"Johnnie Waterman (, also known as Johnnie the Aquarius) is a 1994 Polish drama film directed by Jan Jakub Kolski.

It is one of 40 such areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development. The designated area covers 202,388 ha in total, of which 112,301 ha is on land, with a further 90,087 ha being marine (i.e. below low tide level), making it the largest of the NSAs in both total and marine area. The designated area includes the mountainous south west of Lewis, all of Harris, the Sound of Harris and the northern part of North Uist. National scenic areas are primarily designated due to the scenic qualities of an area, however NSAs may well have other special qualities, for example related to culture, history, archaeology, geology or wildlife. Areas with such qualities may be protected via other national and international designations that overlap with the NSA designation. There are several Natura 2000 sites within the designated area of the NSA. Although the national scenic area designation provides a degree of additional protection via the planning process, there are no bodies equivalent to a national park authority, and whilst local authorities (in this case Comhairle nan Eilean Siar) can produce a management strategy for each one, only the three national scenic areas within Dumfries and Galloway have current management strategies.  Creation of the national scenic area  Following the Second World War, a committee, chaired by Sir Douglas Ramsay, was established to consider preservation of the landscape in Scotland. The report, published in 1945 proposed that five areas (Loch Lomond and the Trossachs, the Cairngorms, Glen Coe-Ben Nevis-Black Mount, Wester Ross and Glen Strathfarrar-Glen Affric-Glen Cannich) should receive a level of protection. Accordingly, the government designated these areas as \\"national park direction areas\\", giving powers for planning decisions taken by local authorities to be reviewed by central government. Following a further review of landscape protection in 1978, additional areas, including the area of the current South Lewis, Harris and North Uist NSA, were identified as worthy of protection due to their landscape qualities. Accordingly, in 1981 the direction areas were replaced by the national scenic area designation, which were based on the 1978 recommendations and thus included this area. The defined area remains as originally mapped in 1978, but was redesignated under new legislation in 2010. Since this date there have been calls for further protection of the scenery of the area, although the Scottish Government rejected a proposal to create a national park on Harris in 2011. In 2013 the Scottish Campaign for National Parks proposed seven areas deemed suitable for national park status, one of which was Harris, but in September 2016 Roseanna Cunningham, the Cabinet Secretary for Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform told the Scottish Parliament that the Government had no plans to designate new national parks in Scotland and instead planned to focus on the two existing national parks. Description South Harris. North Harris contains Clisham (799m), the highest peak in the Outer Hebrides. Steep-sided glens, with precipitous crags, have a mountainous character. Exposure and grazing prevent tree growth. Deep sea lochs in the east penetrate far into the hills. The east coast of Harris has many bays and islets. The west coast has wide, sandy beaches with machair. Rocky headlands, separating the bays, have been sculptured into geos and stacks. Scattered islands lies in the Sound of Harris between South Harris and North Uist. On North Uist the spectacular deep peatland supports a wide variety of vegetation and birds. The settlement of Lochmaddy (an anglicisation of the Scottish Gaelic Loch nam Madadh) is a ferry terminal, and a harbour for the creel fishing and is used for salmon farms. Conservations designations View over northern North Uist. There are four Special Protection Areas (SPA) and five Special Areas of Conservation (SAC), within or overlapping with the NSA. The areas protected by these two Natura 2000 designations overlap, with four sites sharing both designations (although the precise borders differ to some extent). *The Grimersta river and loch system at Langavat in south Lewis is regarded as the best salmon system in the Western Isles and is protected as an SAC. It also forms part of an SPA covering the peatlands of Lewis, which is protected due to the presence of breeding black-throated divers, dunlins, golden eagles, golden plovers, greenshank, merlin and red-throated divers. *Much of North Harris is protected as a SAC due to the variety of montane and heathland habitats. The area is also protected as an SPA due to the presence of breeding pairs of golden eagles. *The machair of North Uist is the second- largest area of machair in the Western Isles, and differs from the machair of South Uist due to the fact that a high proportion of it has been traditionally cultivated or used for rough pasture, promoting a different ecosystem to that found further south. It is protected as both an SAC and an SPA, with the SPA designation also taking parts of the nearby islands of Berneray, Pabbay and Boreray. *Loch nam Madadh is a unique fjardic sea loch that forms part of one of the most extensive and diverse water systems in Europe, combining both salt and fresh water. Loch nam Madadh supports an unusual combination of intertidal plants and animals, and is protected as an SAC. In some of the lagoons, fresh water organisms grow in a layer just above salt water organisms. *Mointeach Scadabhaigh is an area of blanket bog in South Uist. It is the UK's largest example of a type of blanket bog that is rare in Britain, occurring at only two other sites. It is also home to a productive breeding population of red- and black-throated divers, with the area hosting one of the highest-density populations of red-throated divers in the UK. It is protected as both an SAC and an SPA.

Dyke. Nick Nolte did an uncredited voice over for the film's lead actor, David Hyry. Plot An outlaw motorcycle club commits illegal acts, but only to make a point against police corruption. They are normally law-abiding, even going so far as to help an elderly couple whose car stops running. When a police officer rapes a woman, he frames the crime on the bikers. The town's citizens attack the gang in revenge, leading to a battle. Production William Dear asked Michael Nesmith to compose the film's music and Nesmith agreed. The film's crew was unable to pay him, but he composed the music for free. The author Steven Puchalski referred to the film as the \\"perfect funeral wreath to the biker movie phenomenon\\". It was filmed using 16 mm film. Reception Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Verdict, said, \\"amid all its gory, blood-soaked brazenness, there's a message about personal and public perspective that is awfully hard to miss\\". Scott Weinberg, of DVD Talk, said, \\"Highly recommended to anyone who's old enough to remember and appreciate this type of low-budget, down & dirty, occasionally terrible but entirely watchable genre fare.\\" A TV Guide review said, \\"Unimaginatively directed and too bloody for words\\".

He served as Bishop of Camden from 1968 to 1989. Early life and education The second oldest of five children, George Guilfoyle was born in New York City to James J. and Johanna (n√©e McGrath) Guilfoyle. After graduating from Regis High School in 1931, he studied at Georgetown University, from where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1935. In 1939 he earned a Bachelor of Laws degree from Fordham University and was admitted to the New York Bar. He soon abandoned his legal career and entered St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers. Priesthood Guilfoyle was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Francis Spellman on March 25, 1944. He earned a Master of Laws from Columbia University that same year. Guilfoyle then served as a curate at St. Patrick's Cathedral until 1945, when he was transferred to St. Andrew's Church. He served as assistant chancellor of the Archdiocese of New York from 1946 to 1947, and was named director of social research (1947), assistant executive director (1954), and executive director (1956) of Catholic Charities. During his leadership at Catholic Charities, he directed the operation of 199 separate institutions and agencies. He was raised to the rank of a Papal Chamberlain in 1955 and later a Domestic Prelate in 1957. Episcopacy New York On October 17, 1964, Guilfoyle was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of New York and Titular Bishop of Marazanae by Pope Paul VI. He received his episcopal consecration on November 30 from Cardinal Spellman, with Bishops Christopher Joseph Weldon and John Joseph Maguire serving as co-consecrators, at St. Patrick's Cathedral. He remained executive director of Catholic Charities until 1966, when he became episcopal vicar of Staten Island and pastor of St. Peter's Church. Camden Following the death of Archbishop Celestine Damiano, Guilfoyle was named the fourth Bishop of Camden, New Jersey, on January 2, 1968. He was installed at Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception on March 4, 1968. Following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968, Guilfoyle described racism as \\"not a mere myth but an ugly reality\\" and urged Catholics to \\"purge every fragment of racism among us.\\" He established a Diocesan Pastoral Council and directed every parish to establish a parish council in 1968. He also established the Office of Pastoral Planning, Office of Evangelization, and Secretariat for Education. He advocated \\"the right to life from conception to old age,\\" and established the Pro-Life Office in 1973. During his tenure, he erected eight parishes, eleven convents, twenty-three churches, thirty-seven rectories, and six schools. A retreat house was acquired by the diocese, special education facilities were expanded and a Newman Centre erected at Glassboro State College. Nursing homes were constructed and acquired, as well as the establishment of two complexes for the elderly, Victorian Towers and St. Mary's Village. Evangelization in the Hispanic community, through religious service and social ministry, was accomplished through a newly established Hispanic Apostolate; Spanish-language Masses in many South Jersey parishes were instituted, while the diocese worked to obtain Spanish-speaking priests and religious for pastoral work among Hispanics. He served for many years on the Administrative Board of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, holding membership on a number of its committees, including those on priestly life and ministry, conciliation and arbitration (on which he also served as chairman), bishops, diocesan boundaries, budget and finance, Latin America, ecumenical, and motion pictures. Within the Roman Curia, he was a member of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints from 1969 to 1975. Later life and death After twenty-one years as Bishop of Camden, Guilfoyle retired on May 13, 1989. He was hospitalized for a respiratory ailment in May 1991. He died shortly afterwards at Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center in Camden, aged 77. Bishop Guilfoyle Regional Catholic School in Carneys Point is named in his honor.

It is one of the many Palmerston Forts built around Portsmouth during the period of the Second French Empire, as a safeguard against a perceived threat of French invasion by Napoleon III. The hexagonally shaped fort was the main stronghold for the South East coastline of the Isle of Wight and was designed as a final retreat if the island was to be invaded. Due to its location with a view over both Sandown Bay and the Eastern Solent it acted as the command and control centre for the Western batteries on the Isle of Wight (Redcliff Battery, Yaverland Battery, Sandown Fort and Sandown Barrack Battery). The fort had barrack accommodation for 4 officers and 106 men with an original armament of six RBL 7 inch Armstrong guns mounted on the parapet side.  History  1860s: The Yarborough Monument was moved stone by stone from the summit of Bembridge Down to make way for the new fort. 1862-1867: Construction of the fort at a cost of ¬£48,925. 1869: Guns mounted on the fort. 1871-1880: The fort changed hands frequently and was occupied by various military units while armed including: the 103rd Regiment (Royal Bombay Fusiliers), 7th Brigade Royal Artillery, 102nd Regiment (Royal Madras Fusiliers), 49th Regiment, 107th Regiment (Bengal Light Infantry) and then the 42nd Regiment (The Black Watch). 1880-1900: Experimental base for anti submarine and anti torpedo devices. Two heavily armoured cables ran from the fort to the sea to form an indicator loop which was used to detect any passing metal objects. 1892: Royal Artillery Office commanding the East Wight Defences was built. 1900-1914: Training camp and garrison duties. 1914-1920: A cavalry followed by a heavy artillery unit was stationed at the fort. 1920-1939: Territorial army observation post for artillery based at Yaverland Battery. 1938: Royal Navy's anti submarine division laid indicator loops across the channel into Spitbank Fort during the war three further harbour defence loops were laid and monitored from the fort. 1939-1945: Command post for anti- aircraft regiments and H.Q. for local home guard, two Allan Williams turrets were installed. The fort also housed a reserve radar station after the bombing of Ventnor radar station. 1948: The war department relinquished control. 1948-1965: The fort fell into disrepair and was heavily vandalised. 1965: Purchased by Isle of Wight County Council, becomes a Scheduled Ancient Monument. 1967: The fort was acquired by The National Trust as part of Project Neptune. 1968: The National Trust let the fort to a light engineering firm who occupied the site until 1998, due to its protected status the factory buildings were not permanently fixed to the fort. 2008: The Western end of the fort became occupied by a light engineering firm. A team of volunteers from the National Trust began clearing the debris from the fort in 2005 and this work is still ongoing. References Publications * Moore, David, 2010.

About the charitable cause the calendar served, Anneseley responded: \\"We have a very close association with the National Breast Cancer Foundation... but the nature of the publication is not anything that we would have approved to be associated with the NRL.\\" A National Breast Cancer Foundation spokeswoman said the organisation was not behind the actual production of the calendar, but confirmed it would benefit from its sale. Youngquest responded that he knew what he was doing at the time but did it all in the name of charity with proceeds going to breast cancer research. He commented: \\"The photographer [Pedro Virgil] rang and said the best photo he had was a bit revealing and asked me if I minded. I said I didn't mind. It's all for a good cause,\\" Youngquest said. In any case, this isn't Youngquest's first nude calendar (Article about the controversy caused by Youngquest's photo.) and the player regularly makes the top of the most attractive player polls. Youngquest continued: \\"It is for breast cancer, so if it affects my image, I would be pretty disappointed by it. I don't think anyone would be that shallow to let that happen.

Forming out of an area of disturbed weather on October 13, Ivan gradually intensified into a typhoon as it tracked steadily to the west-northwest. On October 15, the storm underwent rapid intensification and reached an intensity corresponding to Category 5 status on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale. Late on October 17, Ivan reached its peak strength with winds of 295 km/h (185 mph) and a barometric pressure of 905 hPa (mbar). Shortly thereafter, the typhoon began to weaken as it approached the Philippines. Ivan eventually made landfall in northern Luzon with winds of 220 km/h (140 mph) on October 20 before weakening to a tropical storm the next day. The storm then curved northeastward and became extratropical on October 25 and dissipating the following day. Although Ivan was a powerful storm at landfall, its effects were relatively minor compared to the storms' intensity; however, 14 people were killed during the storm and two others were listed as missing. Agricultural industries sustained the most severe damage, as thousands of animals drowned in the storm. Total damage was estimated at $9.6 million (1997 USD; $13.1 million 2009 USD). A total of 1,779 homes were destroyed, 13,771 others were damaged and 4,600 hectares of farmland were flooded by the storm. Meteorological history Typhoon Ivan originated from an area of disturbed weather near the equator during the first week of October 1997. Two equatorial troughs, one in the Northern Hemisphere and one in the Southern Hemisphere developed from this system. Three resultant areas of low pressure formed; one in the Southern Hemisphere developed into Tropical Cyclone Lusi on October 8, and two north of the equator steadily tracked westward. The eastern low developed into Typhoon Joan, while the western cyclone became the system that would intensify into Typhoon Ivan. Situated in an environment without significant convective activity, this system initially struggled to become organized. However, the disturbance began to mature, and by October 11, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) discovered a low-level circulation center, prompting the issuance of a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert the following day. The system quickly tracked toward the west-northwest at a forward speed of 33 km/h (21 mph). The JTWC issued their first advisory on the storm early on October 13, designating it Tropical Depression 27W. Around this time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) also classified the cyclone as a tropical depression. Convective banding features developed late on October 13\\\\. The JTWC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and gave it the name Ivan. Early the next day, the JMA also upgraded Ivan to a tropical storm. Later on October 14, Ivan passed roughly 100 km (65 mi) south of Guam and subsequently intensified. Several hours afterwards, the JMA upgraded Ivan to a typhoon. During a 24-hour span, Ivan's winds increased from 120 km/h (75 mph) to 270 km/h (165 mph), making it a Category 5 super typhoon, the eighth of the season, as well as being a twin Category 5 with Typhoon Joan. Late on October 17, Ivan attained its peak intensity with winds of 295 km/h (185 mph) and an official barometric pressure of 905 hPa (mbar). However, the JTWC reported an unofficial pressure of 872 hPa (mbar), which would tie Ivan for the second strongest tropical cyclone worldwide with Typhoons Gay, Angela, Joan, Keith, Zeb and Hurricane Patricia. Due to the storm's proximity to Typhoon Joan, forecast models anticipated Ivan to re-curve before reaching the Philippines; however, the storm maintained its track and did not take the northward turn until impacting the country. The typhoon began to slow and weaken, and on October 20, its center made landfall in extreme northern Luzon with winds of 220 km/h (140 mph). After emerging into the Luzon Strait, Ivan turned to the north-northeast and weakened to a tropical storm. On October 22, the storm briefly re-attained typhoon status before accelerating in forward speed. The system steadily weakened and the JTWC issued their final advisory on the storm on October 24. The JMA continued to monitor Ivan as a tropical cyclone for another day before classifying it as extratropical. The remnants of the powerful typhoon eventually dissipated on October 26. Preparations and impact Typhoons Ivan (left) and Joan (right) on October 18 Thousands of people evacuated from northern areas of the Philippines as Ivan approached. Power was shut off prior to the storm to reduce the risk of electrocution. Four flights were cancelled in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines due to the storm. Residents in Taiwan were advised to take precautions for Typhoon Ivan, though autumn typhoons are rare in the island. Vessels were urged to stay at port due to rough seas throughout the Philippines. Disaster agencies were put on high alert; relief supplies were then stockpiled, the navy was placed on standby, and military search and rescue vehicles were prepped. On October 20, Ivan made landfall in the northern Philippines, producing torrential rains that triggered waist-deep flooding in localized areas. Severe crop losses were reported throughout northern Luzon. One person drowned in floodwaters in Cagayan. Elsewhere in the country, two other people drowned in floodwaters. Numerous power lines and trees were downed throughout the region, rain-triggered landslides blocked several roads. Throughout the country, a total of 14 people were killed and two others were listed as missing. Poultry farms and fisheries sustained significant damage; an estimated $3.6 million in losses resulted from lost stocks in the two businesses. Several thousand animals drowned during the storm. Total damage was estimated at $9.6 million (1997 USD; $13.1 million 2009 USD). A total of 1,779 homes were destroyed, 13,771 others were damaged and 4,600 hectares of croplands were inundated by Typhoon Ivan. Rainfall from the storm was considered to be helpful as the area impacted had been suffering from below average rainfall for several months. Minor damage was also reported in the Marshall Islands. The island of Tiyan recorded of precipitation, contributing to above-average rainfall during the month of October.

III, c. 49) was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain levying a tax on hair powder. The tax was used to finance government programs, especially wars with France in the late 1700s and early 1800s. The Act was repealed in 1869. The Act stated that everyone wishing to use hair powder must, from 5 May 1795, visit a stamp office to enter their name and pay for an annual certificate costing 1 guinea (the equivalent of or in 2020). Certain exemptions were included: the Royal Family and their servants; clergymen with an income of under ¬£100 a year; and members of the armed forces who were privates in the army, artillery soldiers, mariners, engineers, non-commissioned officers, subalterns, officers in the navy below commander, yeomanry, militia, fencibles, and volunteers. A father with more than two unmarried daughters could buy two certificates that would be valid for any number he stated at the stamp office. The master of a household could buy a certificate for a member of his servants, and that certificate would also be valid for their successors within that year. The Hair Powder Certificates, etc. Act 1795 (35 Geo. III, c. 112) was passed later in the same session of Parliament to allow people more time to apply for certificates. The use of hair powder had been declining and the tax hastened its near death. In its first year, the tax raised ¬£200,000. In 1812 46,684 people still paid the tax. In 1855 only 997 did, and almost all of these were servants. By the time it was repealed in 1869 it yielded an annual revenue of ¬£1,000. According to author Jenny Uglow, those who chose to pay the guinea hair powder tax were nicknamed \\"guinea-pigs\\" by reformist Whigs who chose instead to cut their hair short (the \\"French\\" cut) and go without a wig as an expression of solidarity with the French. Those deriding hair-powder taxpayers as \\"guinea-pigs\\" were, in turn, satirized by The Times as members of the \\"Crop Club\\" wearing the \\"Bedford Level\\", a reference to prominent Whig reformer John Russell, Duke of Bedford.

The aim of the exercise was \\"to study, plan for and rehearse in detail the intervention of the Defence Forces in Northern Ireland in order to secure the safety of the minority population\\".The Destiny of the Soldiers: Fianna Fail, Irish Republicianism and the IRA 1926-1973 Background The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association organised protest marches from 1968 seeking to improve conditions for Roman Catholics in Northern Ireland, who were discriminated against by the majority Protestant population. This had led to counter-protests and then sectarian riots, leading to 1,500 Catholic refugees fleeing to the Republic of Ireland. On 13 August 1969 the Taoiseach, Jack Lynch said in a television interview: \\"‚Ä¶the Irish government can no longer stand by and see innocent people injured and perhaps worse\\".The Sunday Times (Irish edition), 30 August 2009, p.4.Burns, John. \\"Irish army plotted Belfast guerrilla war\\", The Sunday Times, 30 August 2009. Retrieved 3 September 2009. His cabinet was divided over what to do, with Kevin Boland and Neil Blaney calling for robust action. On 30 August Lynch ordered the Irish Army Chief of Staff, General Se√°n Mac Eoin, to prepare a plan for possible incursions. The then Northern Irish junior home affairs minister John Taylor recalled that Lynch's comment about no longer standing by resulted in Taylor mobilising 8,000 police reservists \\"to repel a possible invasion\\".The Guardian, 30 August 2009, article by Henry McDonald While the riots continued, the introduction of British Army troops in the Falls area of Belfast, and around the Bogside part of Derry from mid-August under Operation Banner were brought in to theoretically protect Catholic areas from further mass loyalist attacks. Ironically, this intervention would lead to Bloody Sunday in 1972, when fourteen Catholic civilians were killed in the Bogside by British soldiers.  Interim Report of Planning Board on Northern Ireland Operations  In September 1969 an Irish Army document was drawn up called the Interim Report of Planning Board on Northern Ireland Operations. It outlined their concept for feasible military operations within Northern Ireland. The army's planners accepted that it had \\"no capability to engage successfully in conventional, offensive military operations against the security forces in Northern Ireland\\" to protect the Catholic minority from loyalist mobs. The plan called for units of specially trained and equipped Irish commandos to infiltrate Northern Ireland and launch guerrilla-style operations against the Belfast docks, Aldergrove airport, the BBC studios and key industries. The campaign would start in Belfast and the northwest, so as to draw the bulk of security forces in Northern Ireland away from the border areas and turn their attention to the guerrilla campaign. The Irish Army would then invade with four brigades operating in company-strength units to occupy the Catholic-majority towns of Derry and Newry, and attack any remaining security forces in those areas. The Irish Army Transport Corps did not have enough resources to transport all of the necessary forces to the conflict zone, and the plan suggested hiring buses from CI√â. For political reasons, the Republic would not formally declare war when the operation started. Only 2,136 troops out of 12,000 in the army were at actual combat readiness. The operation would leave the Republic of Ireland exposed to \\"retaliatory punitive military action by United Kingdom forces\\". The plan included a warning that: \\"The Defence Forces have no capability of embarking on unilateral military operation [sic] of any kind ‚Ä¶ therefore any operations undertaken against Northern Ireland would be militarily unsound.\\"The Irish Times, op. cit. Critique The 2009 documentary If Lynch Had Invaded interviewed a number of academics, former civil servants and Irish Army officers, and they put forward a number of theories:\\"If Lynch Had Invaded\\", RT√â Television. * The plan to occupy Newry would not save any Catholic refugees, as it was a predominantly Catholic town with no inter-sectarian riots. * The Catholic parts of Derry had suffered assaults from the Royal Ulster Constabulary and Protestant mobs, but was effectively ring-fenced on the introduction of British troops in August; as of October 1969, further attacks were unlikely. * Invading the territory of a much larger and much more powerful country was too much of a risk to the security of Ireland. *The United Kingdom could retaliate massively. The possibility of British occupation as a result of the plan was highly likely. * The plan ignored the incompatibility of forces. The United Kingdom was a member of NATO, while the Irish Defence Forces were much smaller than the British Armed Forces, had inferior arms and transportation in comparison to British forces, and had only minimal air and naval capabilities. The Defence Forces were said to train for \\"World War II operations using World War I weapons\\", such as the Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifle, although most Irish soldiers were armed with FN FAL 7.62 automatic rifles. Former Irish officers such as Vincent Savino recalled that the Irish Army was \\"so short of the basics\\", having been allowed to run down since 1945 by the same politicians who now wanted it to undertake such a dangerous mission. By contrast, British forces in Northern Ireland consisted of almost 3,000 heavily armed soldiers of the 2nd Queens Regiment, the Royal Regiment of Wales, and the Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire. These troops had considerable experience in training and conventional large-scale combat tactics, and many had returned from guarding NATO's Northern Flank. They were equipped with Humber Pig and Saracen armored personnel carriers. Royal Air Force F-4 Phantom and Harrier jets were also stationed at airbases within short flying time from Northern Ireland. These forces would have been capable of dealing decisively with any Irish military incursion into the area. The mismatch was reflected in the choice of title. According to security analyst Tom Clonan, \\"irrespective of the element of surprise, the Irish Army would have been subject to a massive British counterattack ‚Äì probably within hours of their initial incursion. Irish casualties would have been very high as the British would have sought to swiftly and indiscriminately end the Republic's capabilities and occupy the Republic via military intervention\\". * In 1969, both the Republic and the UK were applying to join the European Economic Community. The Republic's application would likely have been jeopardised if it had invaded a \\"friendly neighbour\\". * While the Irish government had called for United Nations involvement in Northern Ireland in August 1969, launching a localised but technical invasion and then calling again for intervention would have led to universal condemnation, being contrary to international law. The Republic of Ireland had joined the UN only in 1955. * All members of NATO are bound by the North Atlantic Treaty to oppose a military incursion on a member state; this would probably force the United States and the rest of the NATO members to intervene. * The targets for covert operations, such as the BBC offices in Belfast, were already guarded by the British Army to protect them from local rioters. None of these targets were linked to the inter-sectarian riots. * An intrusion might have provoked new and more widespread sectarian rioting, causing hundreds of deaths. * An invasion of Northern Ireland by the armed forces of the Republic would likely have met with the same overwhelmingly negative international response as the UK's invasion of the Suez Canal zone during the Suez Crisis in 1956. Historian Diarmaid Ferriter considers that the operation would have been popular at the time, given the strong emotive feeling in the Republic about the situation in Northern Ireland. Arms Crisis Subsequently some more actively nationalist Irish government ministers were tried in 1970 in the Arms Crisis trial, where the defendants included an Irish Army officer. It emerged that a secret Irish government fund of ¬£100,000 had been dedicated to helping the refugees, but some of it had been spent covertly on buying arms for paramilitary groups. Ministers Charles Haughey and Neil Blaney were sacked from their posts.

O Botic√°rio is the largest cosmetic franchise in the world. The main competitors of the company are Natura, Avon Products and Jequiti. History O Botic√°rio was created in 1977 as a small prescription drugstore in the city of Curitiba, capital of the state of Paran√°, in southern Brazil. Today the company is the world‚Äôs largest perfumery and cosmetics franchising network. O Botic√°rio‚Äôs industrial and administrative complex has 34.4 thousand square meters of floor space in the city of S√£o Jos√© dos Pinhais in the Curitiba Metropolitan Area. It employs 1,300 people and creates approximately 10 thousand jobs through its franchising network. O Botic√°rio‚Äôs first manufacturing plant was inaugurated in 1982, with just 1 thousand square meters of floor space. Then it employed 27 people who worked to manufacture about 400 thousand items a year. O Botic√°rio‚Äôs current production exceeds 59 million units.  Funda√ß√£o O Botic√°rio  In 1990, the company created the Funda√ß√£o O Botic√°rio de Prote√ß√£o √† Natureza (O Botic√°rio Nature Protection Foundation), a nonprofit organization that has already sponsored 800 conservationist projects including studies, scientific research, environmental education programs and direct fauna and flora protection actions all over Brazil. The Foundation also supports the \\"Natural Areas Protection Program\\", which aims at implementing its own network of private natural heritage reserves. The first one is the Salto Morato Private Natural Heritage Reserve, which occupies a 2,340-hectare area, in Guaraque√ßaba, on the north coast of the state of Paran√°, in southern Brazil. This reservation protects a significant area of the Atlantic Rainforest, besides being provided with infrastructure for scientific research, environmental education, and outdoor recreation. In November 1999, the reservation supported by Funda√ß√£o O Botic√°rio de Prote√ß√£o √† Natureza was declared a Natural Heritage Site by UNESCO. Products O Botic√°rio‚Äôs product lines consist of approximately 480 items, divided into the following categories: body care, facial care, sun care, makeup, deodorizing colognes, deodorants, soaps and shampoos. Amazonian plants such as a√ßa√≠, cupua√ßu, carna√∫ba, guaran√°, cashew, and passion flower; gums extracted from algae and vegetal extracts, such as arnica and urucum, are among the active ingredients present in the brand‚Äôs products. Controversy In May 2015, the company launched in Brazil a campaign titled \\"Toda Forma de Amor\\" (Every Kind of Love), made for Brazilian Valentine's Day (celebrated every June 12, the day before the Saint Anthony of Padua festivities), the campaign presented heterosexual and homosexual couples embracing and exchanging gifts of the brand. The video generated huge repercussion, mainly in social networks. The commercial, uploaded on YouTube, earned more than three million views and had more than 360,000 likes, against over 180,000 dislikes (until June 6, 2015). Among conservative sectors of society, however, the campaign had negative repercussions. There have been calls for boycotting the brand by people like Silas Malafaia and homophobic statements in social networks. The National Council for Self-Regulatory Advertising (Conar) has also received inunerous complaints and initiated a process to verify possible abuses against the consumer in the advertising campaign of the company. On July 16, however, Conar decided to file a lawsuit against the video. The rapporteur of the process emphasized in his vote: \\"Don't count on publicity to omit the reality.\\" Botic√°rio replied that \\"the proposal of the 'Couples' campaign, which was first broadcast on May 24, is to address, with respect and sensitivity, the current resonance about the most different forms of love regardless of age, race, gender or sexual orientation‚Äîrepresented by the pleasure of giving the person you love a gift on Valentine's Day.\\" In an article published on the UOL Economia website, journalist James Cimino also pointed to inconsistencies in the brand's boycott movement as large multinationals‚Äîsuch as Apple, Microsoft, Google, HP, Intel, Facebook, The Coca-Cola Company, Colgate-Palmolive, Disney, Twitter, Visa, MasterCard, Starbucks, Nike, Xerox, Levi's, Gillette, Absolut, Amazon.com, Ray-Ban, Gap, American Airlines, Tiffany & Co., Budweiser and others‚Äîalso support the LGBT movement, but were not threatened with boycott claims.

It originates near Ellis Mountain in the northern Olympic Mountains on the Olympic Peninsula and flows generally north, emptying into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The Pysht and nearby Hoko River are the two largest streams flowing into the southwestern portion of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The watershed of the Pysht River drains a region of industrial forest lands; 98% of the watershed is zoned commercial forestry and the remainder rural. Nearly all of the forests have been logged at least once and most trees are less than thirty years old. The upper portions of the watershed, which feature steep gradients, are owned by the United States Forest Service. The lower reaches, with low gradients, are largely owned by two industrial forest owners. The name of the Pysht River comes from the Clallam (Salishan) p…ô≈°c't, perhaps meaning \\"against the wind or current\\". Course The Pysht River originates near Ellis Mountain in the northwestern Olympic Mountains of Olympic National Forest. It flows southeast a short distance before turning northeast and leaving the national forest and the mountainous country to enter more rolling and hilly terrain. It collects the tributaries Needham Creek and Green Creek less than a mile upriver from its confluence with the South Fork Pysht River. The South Fork originates in the northern Olympic Mountains and flows north and west to join the main stem Pysht. Tributaries of the South Fork include the West Fork Pysht River, Middle Creek, and Salmonberry Creek. Downstream from the South Fork confluence the main stem Pysht River flows mainly east and slightly north to the small settlement of Pysht near the coast. The river makes a large bend north, then east, then south, then east before emptying into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Two additional tributaries, Reed Creek and Indian Creek, join in the last reach. The mouth of the Pysht River is just south of a headland called Pillar Point and just north of the Pillar Point Recreation Area and campground.General course and elevation info from USGS topographic maps accessed via the \\"GNIS in Google Map\\" feature of the USGS Geographic Names Information System website. The mouth of the Pysht is a tidally influenced estuary and supports a large complex of forested and tidal emergent wetlands. Biology Because the Pysht River, like the Hoko River, is brushy, full of snags, and often carries tannin stained water, it is known as a \\"cedar creek\\". The river supports nine species of freshwater fish, five salmonid and four non-salmonid. The non-salmonids known to be found in the Pysht River include Pacific lamprey (Lampetra tridentata), three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), and two freshwater sculpin species: coastrange sculpin (Cottus aleuticus) and prickly sculpin (Cottus asper). Salmonid species include chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta), sea-run coastal cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki clarki), and steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus). Other fish species are likely to be present in the river's estuary, but which have not been formally sampled, include starry flounder, surf perches, and smelts. Historically the anadromous salmonid fish runs were robust but all have declined, especially the main stem-dependent chinook and chum salmon. Chinook salmon may no longer be viable in the Pysht watershed and the few that are still seen may be strays from nearby populations such as the Hoko River stock. The causes of habitat degradation are thought to have resulted from logging, highway and railroad construction, log transport, and channelization. Other causes of population decline include fishing and disease caused by hatchery supplementation of salmonides. The large estuary is an important salmon rearing habitat. It has recovered somewhat from past heavy impacts, but active restoration efforts may be required to prevent further population declines. Before commercial logging, the forests of the lower Pysht River watershed featured large-diameter stands of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), and western red cedar (Thuja plicata). Deciduous trees such as red alder (Alnus rubra) and big-leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum) were present to a lesser degree. Today nearly the entire basin is industrial forest and subject to repeated logging. Most trees are less than thirty years old. River modifications The Pysht River, its floodplain, and its aquatic habitat has been altered in various ways including road and railroad grade construction, road maintenance and protection (such as riprap), channelization, channel relocation, logging, in- channel wood removal, dredging, homesteading, agricultural development, wetland filling, and rural development. Logging began in the early 20th century and eliminated the original old-growth forests. The Pysht River was channelized to facilitate the transport of logs along the lower river and estuary. Dredging was routinely carried out on the lower river and the dredge spoils were reportedly dumped into the estuary's tidal wetlands for the purpose of agricultural development. A network of logging railroads were built adjacent to the main stem Pysht and the South Fork Pysht. A wagon road that paralleled the Pysht River was converted into a paved state highway Washington State Route 112 in the 1940s.

Each year the perpetual \\"Arlington Million Trophy\\" is presented to the winners of the Arlington Million in a national televised award ceremony. The Arlington Million Trophy is one that was commissioned in 1984 and stays on display at Arlington Park in Arlington Heights, Illinois year round. Arlington Park is owned by Churchill Downs Incorporated and the parent company lists the Arlington Million as one the country's most important races behind the Kentucky Derby and the Kentucky Oaks. The names of the horse and the connections are included in the display.Arlington Million History, Arlington Park website:http://www.arlingtonpark.com/million/million_history.  Dimensions of the trophy  The trophy itself is a work of art. It is a cup (more like a bowl) that stands 24\\" tall and 30\\" wide at the rim of the cup. It is made of solid polished silver and 14 karat gold. The base is two platforms that make the foundation of the trophy. The bottom platform is 14\\" at its base with another platform beveled right on top of the first. Both platforms are made of silver. The base is supporting eight 8\\" Greek revival silver columns. Those columns are capped by another platform that is encircled by a 14\\" gold collar that is 1-1/4\\" tall by 1/8\\" deep. Inside the collar are 1\\" 14 karat gold letters that spell the words Arlington Million. Atop the trophy sits a huge solid silver bowl that is 12\\" tall and 30\\" wide. The bowl is Etched with the words Arlington Million in the shape of an arch. Inside the arch is a 3\\" x 5\\" 14 karat gold relief of the Arlington Park emblem with two horses and a coat of arms. In time this emblem would become the facility's logo and used on marketing pieces for the track.  Owners, trainers and jockeys trophies  Although the pertpetual trophy is only used in the ceremony, a 60% solid silver only replica is given to the winning owner each year. That replica stands 18\\" tall and is 14\\" wide at the rim of the cup. It is supported by six Greek revival columns. The winning trainer and jockey also receive trophies but these do not resemble the perpetual trophy.  Traditions  Each year a garland of \\"Million Dollar Flowers\\" are draped around the winner. Richard Duchossois has started several traditions run in relation to the race. The first is right after the race is run, Mr. D. will pass out dozens of flutes of champagne and toast the winners just before watching the replay on the jumbotron. Then the trophies are passed out by Chairman Emeritus of Arlington Park Richard Duchossois and then interviews and commentaries are made. Even though Richard Duchossois merged Arlington Park with Churchill Downs Inc. several years ago, everyone still thinks of the local oval as Mr. D's place. And indeed, he patrols the facility often and is always a presence in the paddock for big events such as the International Festival of Racing, the annual celebration of racing on turf which features the Grade I Arlington Million. One can count on the festival to lure top horses from throughout the world.  Blanket of flowers  Like most signature races, the Arlington Million has its version of a garland of flowers that is draped over withers of the winning horse. This blanket is unlike most prestigious grade one races because it does not have just one type of flower. The Kentucky Derby has roses, the Preakness Stakes has the black-eyed Susans, the Belmont Stakes has white carnations, the Breeders' Cup has Chrysanthemums. The Arlington Million calls their blanket their \\"Million Dollar Flowers.\\" It has a Magnolia backing that is topped with a red and white peppermint striped broad-brimmed blanket. It is arranged with a field of red carnations that is 20\\" wide surrounded by a 4\\" trim of two white carnations representing the flowers of the Arlington Million. The entire blanket is 84\\" long by 24\\" wide.

The Hegekopf is in the centre. The Upland, which is Low German for something like Oberland (\\"highland\\") or auf dem Land (\\"in the country\\"), is a low mountain region forming the northeastern part of the High Sauerland and belongs the German state of Hesse, unlike the remainder of the High Sauerland which lies in Westphalia. The Upland falls within the district of Waldeck-Frankenberg, in North Hesse and corresponds to the territory of the municipality of Willingen.  Geography  The historic Upland lies in the southwestern area of the Diemelsee Nature Park at an average height of 500 to 700 m above NN. The northwestern and southwestern parts are almost entirely forested, whilst the centre, the area formally defined as a natural region called Upland (see below), only has islands of woods around some of the peaks.  Natural regions  The historic Upland lies predominantly in the northwestern Rothaar Mountains mountain range with smaller elements also in the East Sauerland foothills. It incorporates the natural region of Upland, as well as the (northeastern) half of the natural region of Langenberg, which contains the highest peak in the Rothaargebirge, the 843,1 m high Langenberg, as well as other summits over 800 m high. The following natural regions lie wholly or partly (see brackets) in the historic Upland:Hochsauerland (Rothaargebirge) * 33 S√ºder Uplands ** 332 East Sauerland Foothills *** 332.6 (Fore Upland) Adorf Bay **** 332.60 Flechtdorf H√∂ckerflur (extreme west only) ** 333 Rothaar Mountains *** 333.5 Winterberg Highland **** 333.58 Langenberg (northeast half) *** 333.8 Hochsauerland Schlucht Mountains **** 333.82 Schellhorn and Treis Forests (extreme southeast) *** 333.9 Upland **** 333.90 Inner Upland (apart from the extreme north) **** 333.91 Fore Upland Ridge (west and centre only)  Geology  The soils of the Upland are based mainly on Upper Devonian marl, agillaceous shale and calcareous sandstone. This combination has produced good soils for arable farming. As a result, the forests were cleared very early on and replaced by wood pasture (the East Sauerland \\"mountain heaths\\").  Mountains  February 2008 winter view of the Langenberg The highest mountain in the Upland is the Langenberg (), which is located immediately next to the border with neighbouring North-Rhine- Westphalia (and just on the Westphalian side). The almost equally high Hegekopf (842.9 m) lies opposite and entirely on Hessian territory. Since autumn 2002 the Ettelsberg (837.7 m) has had an observation platform on the Hochheideturm with a height of 875 m. Amongst the mountains of the Upland (including all the \\"eight hundreds\\") are those in the following list.

Culver Battery is a former coastal artillery battery on Culver Down, on the eastern side of the Isle of Wight, England. The fortification is one of several Palmerston Forts built on the island following concerns about the size and strength of the French Navy in the late 19th century. It was operational during the First and Second World Wars. The battery was closed in 1956. Planning A battery on the eastern cliff of Culver Down was first proposed in 1887. Its purpose was to stop enemy ships firing unopposed at the pre- existing batteries at Yaverland and Redcliff. The new fortification would be armed with three 6-inch breachloaders with two QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss in support. The guns would all be fitted on hydraulically operated disappearing mounts. However, by 1889, even though the battery had still not been built, the War Office had decided the Hotchkiss would be replaced with 4.7-inch guns. The delay in construction was caused by a disagreement at the War Office between the Inspector-General of Fortifications and the Director of Artillery over the installation of disappearing mounts. Objections were raised over their necessity because Culver Down is atop a cliff, above the shoreline. The row led to further delay as the funding for the military project was no longer available. Construction The battery was eventually built between 3 May 1904 and 21 July 1906. The two main gun emplacements, which were built from brick and reinforced concrete, each had a fixed barbette that housed a 9.2-inch Mk X gun. A report in 1906 by the Royal Engineers stated: Due to the purpose of the battery being to deter naval attack, its two 9.2-inch guns were not intended to cover Sandown Bay. But they could fire as far as Spithead, bombarding any enemy ship entering The Solent. Its command post was in the same building as the Port War Signal Station, which was located between the battery and Bembridge Fort to the north. First World War During the First World War, the battery's main role was to defend the Isle of Wight's torpedo boats' anchorage against long-range fire from armoured cruisers. Under war- time conditions, the battery had toilets, wash block, mess, and general storerooms as well as a workshop and telephone room. When not on duty, guns crews lived in the barracks at Bembridge Fort. Ammunition was kept in bombardment-proof underground magazines behind the emplacements. Additional shells and cordite were stored at Bembridge. In addition to the two coastal guns, the battery had a 6-pound Hotchkiss that was used as an anti-aircraft weapon. Inter-war period Between 1922 and 1924 the battery's barbettes were replaced with new mountings that allowed the guns to elevate up to 30 degrees, increasing the effective range beyond . In 1927, Culver was used as the test centre for the Fortress Plotting system, a type of experimental corrected firing for coastal artillery. In 1934 three 6-inch B.L. mark VII guns were temporarily fitted on 45-degree mountings for long range gunnery trials. An experimental twin-6 pounder was installed to test fire control in the mid-1930s. Second World War By the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Culver Down was manned by 118th Battery from the 527th Coast Regiment. The battery's two main guns now had ranges of up to , meaning they could assist Nodes Point to prevent long-range bombardments of Spithead or Portsmouth Dockyard. By 1942, as the fear of German invasion waned, the battery was stood down from full-time night alerts. In 1943, a Coastal Defence(CD)/Chain Home Low(CHL) radar station was erected just to the east of Culver Battery. Post-war and decommissioning Remains of one of the 9.2-inch gun emplacements at Culver Battery in 2016. In 1947 two BL 6 inch Mk 23 naval guns were erected in front of the 9.2-inch coastal guns for high- angle shooting tests. Two heavy-calibre 3.7-inch AA guns were also used for coast artillery practice. In 1956, the battery was decommissioned by the Ministry of Defence. After the guns, the fire control centre, storerooms and domestic quarters were completely removed, the site was covered with earth. However, in 1966, the gun emplacements were re-excavated to make them more accessible. The battery is now a viewing point and public picnic area owned and operated by the National Trust.

They occur from either momentary interactions between molecules (the London dispersion force) or permanent electrostatic attractions between dipoles. They can be explained using a simple phenomenological approach (see intermolecular force), or using a quantum mechanical approach. Perturbation theory Hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole interactions, and London (Van der Waals) forces are most naturally accounted for by Rayleigh- Schr√∂dinger perturbation theory (RS-PT). In this theory--applied to two monomers A and B--one uses as unperturbed Hamiltonian the sum of two monomer Hamiltonians, H^{(0)} \\\\equiv H^{A}+ H^{B} In the present case the unperturbed states are products \\\\Phi_n^A \\\\Phi_m^B\\\\quad with \\\\quad H^A \\\\Phi_n^A = E_n^A\\\\Phi_n^A\\\\quad and \\\\quad H^B \\\\Phi_m^B = E_m^B\\\\Phi_m^B Supermolecular approach The early theoretical work on intermolecular forces was invariably based on RS-PT and its antisymmetrized variants. However, since the beginning of the 1990s it has become possible to apply standard quantum chemical methods to pairs of molecules. This approach is referred to as the supermolecule method. In order to obtain reliable results one must include electronic correlation in the supermolecule method (without it dispersion is not accounted for at all), and take care of the basis set superposition error. This is the effect that the atomic orbital basis of one molecule improves the basis of the other. Since this improvement is distance dependent, it easily gives rise to artifacts. Exchange The monomer functions Œ¶nA and Œ¶mB are antisymmetric under permutation of electron coordinates (i.e., they satisfy the Pauli principle), but the product states are not antisymmetric under intermolecular exchange of the electrons. An obvious way to proceed would be to introduce the intermolecular antisymmetrizer \\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{A}}^{AB}. But, as already noticed in 1930 by Eisenschitz and London,R. Eisenschitz and F. London, Z. Physik 60, 491 (1930) . English translations in H. Hettema, Quantum Chemistry, Classic Scientific Papers, World Scientific, Singapore (2000), p. 336. this causes two major problems. In the first place the antisymmetrized unperturbed states are no longer eigenfunctions of H(0), which follows from the non-commutation : \\\\big[ \\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{A}}^{AB}, H^{(0)}\\\\big] e 0 . In the second place the projected excited states : \\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{A}}^{AB} \\\\Phi^A_n \\\\Phi^B_m become linearly dependent and the choice of a linearly independent subset is not apparent. In the late 1960s the Eisenschitz-London approach was revived and different rigorous variants of symmetry adapted perturbation theory were developed. (The word symmetry refers here to permutational symmetry of electrons). The different approaches shared a major drawback: they were very difficult to apply in practice. Hence a somewhat less rigorous approach (weak symmetry forcing) was introduced: apply ordinary RS-PT and introduce the intermolecular antisymmetrizer at appropriate places in the RS-PT equations. This approach leads to feasible equations, and, when electronically correlated monomer functions are used, weak symmetry forcing is known to give reliable results.B. Jeziorski, R. Moszynski, and K. Szalewicz, Chem. Rev. 94, 1887-1930 (1994) .K. Szalewicz and B. Jeziorski, in: Molecular Interactions, editor S. Scheiner, Wiley, Chichester (1995). . The first-order (most important) energy including exchange is in almost all symmetry-adapted perturbation theories given by the following expression : E^{(1)}_\\\\mathrm{antisymmetric} = \\\\frac{ \\\\langle \\\\Phi_0^A \\\\Phi_0^BV^{AB}\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{A}}^{AB}\\\\Phi_0^A \\\\Phi_0^B \\\\rangle} { \\\\langle \\\\Phi_0^A \\\\Phi_0^B\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{A}}^{AB}\\\\Phi_0^A \\\\Phi_0^B \\\\rangle} . The main difference between covalent and non-covalent forces is the sign of this expression. In the case of chemical bonding this interaction is attractive (for certain electron-spin state, usually spin-singlet) and responsible for large bonding energies--on the order of a hundred kcal/mol. In the case of intermolecular forces between closed shell systems, the interaction is strongly repulsive and responsible for the \\"volume\\" of the molecule (see Van der Waals radius). Roughly speaking, the exchange interaction is proportional to the differential overlap between Œ¶0A and Œ¶0B. Since the wavefunctions decay exponentially as a function of distance, the exchange interaction does too. Hence the range of action is relatively short, which is why exchange interactions are referred to as short range interactions. Electrostatic interactions By definition the electrostatic interaction is given by the first-order Rayleigh-Schr√∂dinger perturbation (RS-PT) energy (without exchange): : E^{(1)}_\\\\mathrm{electrostatic} = \\\\langle \\\\Phi_0^A \\\\Phi_0^BV^{AB}\\\\Phi_0^A \\\\Phi_0^B \\\\rangle . Let the clamped nucleus Œ± on A have position vector RŒ±, then its charge times the Dirac delta function, ZŒ± Œ¥(r ‚àí RŒ±), is the charge density of this nucleus. The total charge density of monomer A is given by : \\\\rho^A_\\\\mathrm{tot}(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha} Z_\\\\alpha \\\\delta(\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{R}_\\\\alpha) - \\\\rho^A_\\\\mathrm{el}(\\\\mathbf{r}) with the electronic charge density given by an integral over nA ‚àí 1 primed electron coordinates: : \\\\rho^A_\\\\mathrm{el}(\\\\mathbf{r}) = n_A \\\\int |\\\\Phi^A_0(\\\\mathbf{r}, \\\\mathbf{r}'_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\mathbf{r}'_{n_A})|^2 d\\\\mathbf{r}'_2 \\\\cdots d\\\\mathbf{r}'_{n_A}. An analogous definition holds for the charge density of monomer B. It can be shown that the first-order quantum mechanical expression can be written as : E^{(1)}_\\\\mathrm{electrostatic} = \\\\int\\\\int \\\\rho^A_\\\\mathrm{tot}(\\\\mathbf{r}_1)\\\\frac{1}{r_{12}} \\\\rho^B_\\\\mathrm{tot}(\\\\mathbf{r}_2) d\\\\mathbf{r}_1 d\\\\mathbf{r}_2, which is nothing but the classical expression for the electrostatic interaction between two charge distributions. This shows that the first-order RS-PT energy is indeed equal to the electrostatic interaction between A and B. Multipole expansion At present it is feasible to compute the electrostatic energy without any further approximations other than those applied in the computation of the monomer wavefunctions. In the past this was different and a further approximation was commonly introduced: VAB was expanded in a (truncated) series in inverse powers of the intermolecular distance R. This yields the multipole EXPANSION of the electrostatic energy. Since its concepts still pervade the theory of intermolecular forces, it will be presented here. In this article the following expansion is proved : V^{AB} = \\\\sum_{\\\\ell_A=0}^\\\\infty \\\\sum_{\\\\ell_B=0}^\\\\infty (-1)^{\\\\ell_B} \\\\binom{2\\\\ell_A+2\\\\ell_B}{2\\\\ell_A}^{1/2} \\\\sum_{M=-\\\\ell_A-\\\\ell_B}^{\\\\ell_A+\\\\ell_B} (-1)^{M} I_{\\\\ell_A+\\\\ell_B,-M}(\\\\mathbf{R}_{AB})\\\\; \\\\left[\\\\mathbf{Q}^{\\\\ell_A} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{Q}^{\\\\ell_B} \\\\right]^{\\\\ell_A+\\\\ell_B}_M with the Clebsch-Gordan series defined by : \\\\left[\\\\mathbf{Q}^{\\\\ell_A} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{Q}^{\\\\ell_B} \\\\right]^{\\\\ell_A+\\\\ell_B}_M \\\\equiv \\\\sum_{m_A=-\\\\ell_A}^{\\\\ell_A} \\\\sum_{m_B=-\\\\ell_B}^{\\\\ell_B}\\\\; Q_{m_A}^{\\\\ell_A} Q_{m_B}^{\\\\ell_B}\\\\;\\\\langle \\\\ell_A, m_A; \\\\ell_B, m_B\\\\ell_A+\\\\ell_B, M \\\\rangle. and the irregular solid harmonic is defined by : I_{L,M}(\\\\mathbf{R}_{AB}) \\\\equiv \\\\left[\\\\frac{4\\\\pi}{2L+1}\\\\right]^{1/2}\\\\; \\\\frac{Y_{L,M}(\\\\widehat{\\\\mathbf{R}}_{AB})}{R_{AB}^{L+1}}. The function YL,M is a normalized spherical harmonic, while Q^{\\\\ell_A}_{m_A} and Q^{\\\\ell_B}_{m_B} are spherical multipole moment operators. This expansion is manifestly in powers of 1/RAB. Insertion of this expansion into the first-order (without exchange) expression gives a very similar expansion for the electrostatic energy, because the matrix element factorizes, : \\\\begin{align} E^{(1)}_\\\\mathrm{electrostatic} = & \\\\sum_{\\\\ell_A=0}^\\\\infty \\\\sum_{\\\\ell_B=0}^\\\\infty (-1)^{\\\\ell_B} \\\\binom{2\\\\ell_A+2\\\\ell_B}{2\\\\ell_A}^{1/2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\sum_{M=-\\\\ell_A-\\\\ell_B}^{\\\\ell_A+\\\\ell_B} (-1)^{M} I_{\\\\ell_A+\\\\ell_B,-M}(\\\\mathbf{R}_{AB})\\\\; \\\\left[\\\\mathbf{M}^{\\\\ell_A} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{M}^{\\\\ell_B} \\\\right]^{\\\\ell_A+\\\\ell_B}_M, \\\\end{align} with the permanent multipole moments defined by : M^{\\\\ell_A}_{m_A} \\\\equiv \\\\langle \\\\Phi_0^A Q^{\\\\ell_A}_{m_A}\\\\Phi_0^A\\\\rangle \\\\quad\\\\hbox{and}\\\\quad M^{\\\\ell_B}_{m_B} \\\\equiv \\\\langle \\\\Phi_0^B Q^{\\\\ell_B}_{m_B}\\\\Phi_0^B\\\\rangle . We see that the series is of infinite length, and, indeed, most molecules have an infinite number of non-vanishing multipoles. In the past, when computer calculations for the permanent moments were not yet feasible, it was common to truncate this series after the first non-vanishing term. Which term is non-vanishing, depends very much on the symmetry of the molecules constituting the dimer. For instance, molecules with an inversion center such as a homonuclear diatomic (e.g., molecular nitrogen N2), or an organic molecule like ethene (C2H4) do not possess a permanent dipole moment (l=1), but do carry a quadrupole moment (l=2). Molecules such a hydrogen chloride (HCl) and water (H2O) lack an inversion center and hence do have a permanent dipole. So, the first non- vanishing electrostatic term in, e.g., the N2--H2O dimer, is the lA=2, lB=1 term. From the formula above follows that this term contains the irregular solid harmonic of order L = lA \\\\+ lB = 3, which has an R‚àí4 dependence. But in this dimer the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction (R‚àí5) is not unimportant either, because the water molecule carries a non-vanishing quadrupole as well. When computer calculations of permanent multipole moments of any order became possible, the matter of the convergence of the multipole series became urgent. It can be shown that, if the charge distributions of the two monomers overlap, the multipole expansion is formally divergent.  Ionic interactions  It is debatable whether ionic interactions are to be seen as intermolecular forces, some workers consider them rather as special kind of chemical bonding. The forces occur between charged atoms or molecules (ions). Ionic bonds are formed when the difference between the electron affinity of one monomer and the ionization potential of the other is so large that electron transfer from the one monomer to the other is energetically favorable. Since a transfer of an electron is never complete there is always a degree of covalent bonding. Once the ions (of opposite sign) are formed, the interaction between them can be seen as a special case of multipolar attraction, with a 1/RAB distance dependence. Indeed, the ionic interaction is the electrostatic term with lA = 0 and lB = 0. Using that the irregular harmonics for L = 0 is simply : I_{0,0}(\\\\mathbf{R}_{AB}) = \\\\frac{1}{R_{AB}}, and that the monopole moments and their Clebsch-Gordan coupling are : M^{0_A}_0 = q_A,\\\\quad M^{0_B}_0 = q_B \\\\quad\\\\hbox{and}\\\\quad [\\\\mathbf{M}^{0_A}\\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{M}^{0_A}]^0_0 = q_A q_B , (where qA and qB are the charges of the molecular ions) we recover--as to be expected--Coulomb's law : E^{(1)}_\\\\mathrm{electrostatic} = \\\\frac{q_A q_B}{R_{AB}} + \\\\hbox{higher terms}. For shorter distances, where the charge distributions of the monomers overlap, the ions will repel each other because of inter-monomer exchange of the electrons. Ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points due to the large amount of energy required to break the forces between the charged ions. When molten they are also good conductors of heat and electricity, due to the free or delocalized ions. Writing : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}^A = (\\\\mu_x^A, \\\\mu_y^A, \\\\mu_z^A) \\\\quad\\\\hbox{and}\\\\quad \\\\mu_z^A = \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}^A\\\\cdot \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{R}}_{AB} \\\\equiv \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}^A\\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{R}_{AB}}{R_{AB}} and similarly for B, we get the well-known expression : E_{\\\\mathrm{dip-dip}} = \\\\frac{1}{R^{3}_{AB}}\\\\left[ \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}^A\\\\cdot\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}^B - 3 (\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}^A\\\\cdot \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{R}}_{AB}) (\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{R}}_{AB}\\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}^B) \\\\right]. As a numerical example we consider the HCl dimer depicted above. We assume that the left molecule is A and the right B, so that the z-axis is along the molecules and points to the right. Our (physical) convention of the dipole moment is such that it points from negative to positive charge. Note parenthetically that in organic chemistry the opposite convention is used. Since organic chemists hardly ever perform vector computations with dipoles, confusion hardly ever arises. In organic chemistry dipoles are mainly used as a measure of charge separation in a molecule. So, : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}^A = \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}^B = \\\\mu_\\\\mathrm{HCl} \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\quad\\\\hbox{and}\\\\quad E_{\\\\mathrm{dip-dip}} = \\\\frac{-2\\\\mu^2_\\\\mathrm{HCl}}{R^{3}_{AB}}. The value of ŒºHCl is 0.43 (atomic units), so that at a distance of 10 bohr the dipole-dipole attraction is ‚àí3.698 10‚àí4 hartree (‚àí0.97 kJ/mol). If one of the molecules is neutral and freely rotating, the total electrostatic interaction energy becomes zero. (For the dipole-dipole interaction this is most easily proved by integrating over the spherical polar angles of the dipole vector, while using the volume element sinŒ∏ dŒ∏dœÜ). In gases and liquids molecules are not rotating completely freely--the rotation is weighted by the Boltzmann factor exp(‚àíEdip-dip/kT), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T the absolute temperature. It was first shown by John Lennard-JonesJ. E. Lennard-Jones, Proc. Phys. Soc. (London) 43, 461 (1931) . that the temperature-averaged dipole-dipole interaction is : \\\\overline{E}_\\\\mathrm{dip-dip} = -\\\\frac{2|\\\\mu^A|^2|\\\\mu^B|^2 }{3R_{AB}^6 }\\\\frac{1}{kT}. Since the averaged energy has an R‚àí6 dependence, it is evidently much weaker than the unaveraged one, but it is not completely zero. It is attractive, because the Boltzmann weighting favors somewhat the attractive regions of space. In HCl-HCl we find for T = 300 K and RAB = 10 bohr the averaged attraction ‚àí62 J/mol, which shows a weakening of the interaction by a factor of about 16 due to thermal rotational motion.  Anisotropy and non-additivity of intermolecular forces  Consider the interaction between two electric point charges at position \\\\vec{r}_1 and \\\\vec{r}_2. By Coulomb's law the interaction potential depends only on the distance |\\\\vec{r}_1-\\\\vec{r}_2between the particles. For molecules this is different. If we see a molecule as a rigid 3-D body, it has 6 degrees of freedom (3 degrees for its orientation and 3 degrees for its position in R3). The interaction energy of two molecules (a dimer) in isotropic and homogeneous space is in general a function of 2√ó6‚àí6=6 degrees of freedom (by the homogeneity of space the interaction does not depend on the position of the center of mass of the dimer, and by the isotropy of space the interaction does not depend on the orientation of the dimer). The analytic description of the interaction of two arbitrarily shaped rigid molecules requires therefore 6 parameters. (One often uses two Euler angles per molecule, plus a dihedral angle, plus the distance.) The fact that the intermolecular interaction depends on the orientation of the molecules is expressed by stating that the potential is anisotropic. Since point charges are by definition spherical symmetric, their interaction is isotropic. Especially in the older literature, intermolecular interactions are regularly assumed to be isotropic (e.g., the potential is described in Lennard-Jones form, which depends only on distance). Consider three arbitrary point charges at distances r12, r13, and r23 apart. The total interaction U is additive; i.e., it is the sum : U = u(r_{12})+ u(r_{13})+u(r_{23}). Again for molecules this can be different. Pretending that the interaction depends on distances only‚Äîbut see above‚Äîthe interaction of three molecules takes in general the form : U = u(r_{12})+ u(r_{13})+u(r_{23}) +u(r_{12},r_{13},r_{23}), where u( r_{12},r_{13},r_{23}) is a non-additive three-body interaction. Such an interaction can be caused by exchange interactions, by induction, and by dispersion (the Axilrod-Teller triple dipole effect).

The screenplay by Tennessee Williams and Peter Berneis is based on the 1944 Williams play of the same title. It was the first of his plays to be adapted for the screen. Plot While on duty, Merchant Mariner Tom Wingfield recalls his life in a dilapidated St. Louis apartment with his delusional mother Amanda and crippled younger sister Laura, and their story unfolds via flashback. Abandoned by her husband, Amanda is forced to sell magazine subscriptions, but still considers herself superior to her working class neighbors. Concerned about her daughter, a shy loner who is training to be a secretary, but whose real interest is her collection of glass animal figurines, Amanda urges Tom to bring home a friend who might be interested in dating his sister. He finally relents and invites Jim O'Connor to dinner. Amanda is thrilled that her daughter finally will have a \\"gentleman caller\\" courting her. Determined to make a good first impression, she makes elaborate preparations for the meal, but complications arise when Laura learns the name of their expected guest, a boy she recalls was one of the most popular in high school. Feigning illness, she initially refuses to join everyone at the dinner table, but eventually Amanda encourages her to join the group, then arranges for Laura and Jim to be alone. Realizing she suffers from an inferiority complex, he draws her out of her shell by expressing interest in her collection and then persuading her to dance with him. Stumbling, Laura causes a glass unicorn to fall to the floor and lose its horn. At first upset by the damage, she realizes the loss of the horn makes the unicorn more like the horses and therefore less noticeable, as she feels she herself is because of her pronounced limp. Jim suggests he and Laura go to the Paradise Ballroom, and Amanda is delighted, until he mentions he is engaged to a woman named Betty. Laura gives him the broken unicorn and invites him to return some day with his fianc√©e, but after he leaves her devastated mother berates Tom for raising her hopes. Laura is more understanding and reminds her brother she loves him. Seemingly free of her limp and brimming with self-confidence, Laura awaits a visit from another \\"gentleman caller\\" in an upbeat ending that deviates from the play. Production Producer Charles K. Feldman originally wanted Jeanne Crain and Ethel Barrymore for the roles of Laura and Amanda. Gene Tierney, Montgomery Clift, Marlon Brando, Tallulah Bankhead, Miriam Hopkins, and Ralph Meeker also were considered for the film. Bankhead was Irving's first choice, he wrote of her screen test: \\"I was absolutely floored by her performance. It's the greatest test I've ever made or seen in my life. I couldn't believe I was seeing such reality. Bankhead was absolutely natural, so moving, so touching without even trying.\\" However, Jack Warner had suffered because of Errol Flynn's bouts of alcohol abuse, and he feared the same problems from Tallulah (also an alcoholic), and for this reason decided not to sign her.Just Making Movies The first script was written by Norman Corwin, but only Tennessee Williams and Peter Berneis received credit for the screenplay. Despite the fact Williams had an active hand in bringing his play to the screen, he was unhappy with the outcome, calling the casting of Gertrude Lawrence as Amanda \\"a dismal error\\" and the overall film a \\"dishonest\\" adaptation of his work.Morley, Sheridan, Gertrude Lawrence. New York, New York: McGraw-Hill 1981. pp. 181-182Erskine, Thomas L., Video Versions: Film Adaptations of Plays on Video. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Publishing Group 2000. , pp. 129-130 In the scene in which Laura helps Tom get into bed, \\"Someone to Watch Over Me\\" is used as the underscore. The song, written by George and Ira Gershwin, was introduced by Gertrude Lawrence in Oh, Kay! in 1926. Jane Wyman reprised her role opposite Fay Bainter as Amanda in a Lux Radio Theatre broadcast on March 8, 1954. The play later was adapted twice for television, in 1966 with Shirley Booth, Barbara Loden, Pat Hingle, and Hal Holbrook, and in 1973 with Katharine Hepburn, Joanna Miles, Sam Waterston, and Michael Moriarty. In 1987, Paul Newman directed a feature film remake starring Joanne Woodward, John Malkovich, Karen Allen, and James Naughton. Cast *Gertrude Lawrence ..... Amanda Wingfield *Jane Wyman ..... Laura Wingfield *Kirk Douglas ..... Jim O'Connor *Arthur Kennedy ..... Tom Wingfield Critical reception Bosley Crowther of The New York Times said the film \\"comes perilously close to sheer buffoonery in some of its most fragile scenes. And this makes for painful diffusion of the play's obvious poignancy.\\" He added, \\"Apparently, Mr. Williams . . . was persuaded to 'fatten' the role of the faded and fatuous mother to suit the talents of Gertrude Lawrence . . . well known as an actress with a brilliant and devastating flair for brittle high comedy and satire, preferably No√´l Coward style. So presumably it was considered advisable to give her a chance to play the old belle in this drama with a list towards the lady's comic side. If such was the story-conference reasoning, it was woefully unfortunate, for the mother . . . is the fatal weakness of the film . . . Miss Lawrence and the screenplay make her a farcically exaggerated shrew with the zeal of a burlesque comedian to see her diffident daughter wed . . . Furthermore, it must be mentioned that the Southern accent which Miss Lawrence affects is not only disturbingly erratic but it has an occasional Cockney strain. The character is sufficiently murky without this additional mystery. As much as we hate to say so, Miss Lawrence's performance does not compare with the tender and radiant creation of the late Laurette Taylor on the stage. On the other hand, modest Jane Wyman is beautifully sensitive in the role of the crippled and timid daughter who finds escape in her menagerie of glass, and Arthur Kennedy is intriguingly caustic as the incredibly long-suffering son. Kirk Douglas is appropriately shallow as the young man who comes to call. They all do very nicely by Mr. Williams' electric scenes and lines. That is to say, they do nicely when the script and the direction permit‚Äîand that is to say when Miss Lawrence is not overwhelming the screen. It is regrettable that Director Irving Rapper was compelled, it appears, to kick around the substance of a frail, illusory drama as though it were plastic and not Venetian glass.\\"New York Times review TV Guide rated the film three out of four stars and commented, \\"This bittersweet, delicate story is handled with care by director Rapper, but the accent is placed more on laughs than on pensive study, which somewhat weakens the play's original intent. Burks' fluid camera, however, avoids a stagey look to the production.\\"TV Guide review Film critic Leslie Halliwell gave the film warm praise: 'Fluent and good-looking production, memorable performances' Halliwell's Film and Video Guide [1999 edition], p. 322.

According to the Arab Muslim historian Ibn Ishaq, Najran was the first place where Christianity took root in South Arabia. In the early 6th century, the Christians are said to have been persecuted by a Himyarite king named Dhu Nuwas. Dhu Nuwas was eventually defeated after foreign intervention from Abyssinia. In the 7th century, Christians of Najran interacted with the Islamic prophet Muhammad, who allowed them to worship in his mosque. There is evidence that the community continued to thrive until the 9th century; the community no longer exists today. Pre-Christian Najran Prior to the rise of Christianity, the people of Najran were polytheists and worshipped a tall date-palm tree, for which also they had an annual festival when they hung upon it the finest garments they could find, and female ornaments. Then they would come and dance around it the whole day. During this period, they had a chief named Abdullah ibn ath-Thamir who became the first Najranite to embrace Christianity. A pious Christian builder and bricklayer named Phemion settled among them and led them to his religion and its religious laws, which they adopted. Before the advent of Islam, it appears from indications in the Qur'an it would appear that the Jews to the West of the Himyarite Kingdom, in western Arabia, maintained some form of rabbinical organisation, possibly connected to late antique Judaism, and were not wholly cut off from their brethren elsewhere in the Middle East.Jonathan Porter Berkey, The Formation of Islam: Religion and Society in the Near East, 600-1800, Cambridge University Press, 2003 p.46. One source speaks of rabbis from Tiberias itself enjoying the hospitality of Dhu Nuwas's court. The apparent conversion of local Himyarite rulers to Judaism, or some form of a Judaic monotheism,Christopher Haas, 'Geopolitics and Georgian Identity in Late Antiquity: The Dangerous World of Vakhtang Gorgasali,' in Tamar Nutsubidze, Cornelia B. Horn, Basil Louri√©(eds.),Georgian Christian Thought and Its Cultural Context, BRILL pp.29-44, p.36.:'inscriptions with divine epithets having clear affinities to Judaism indicate that the Himyarite king, Malkƒ´karib Yuha'min (c.375.400) along with his son and successor, Abƒ´karib As'ad (c.400-445), embraced, if not Judaism, then a Judaistic monotheist religion.' as early as the late fourth century under the TabbƒÅi'a dynasty, is indirect evidence that suggests that effective Jewish proselytization was active in the region. Christian era The Christians of Najran were divided into two sects. One drew on a variety of Nestorianism, which a local merchant had acquired during a sojourn in al-Hira, and took back to Najran sometime during the reign of the Sassanid ruler Yazdegerd II. The other was a form of monophysitism.Christian Julien Robin,'Arabia and Ethiopia,'in Scott Johnson (ed.) Oxford Handbook of Late Antiquity, Oxford University Press 2012 pp.247-333.p.282 had suffered an earlier, but brief, stint of persecution with the advent of the new dynasty under the Himyarite ruler Shurihbi'ƒ´l Yakkuf (or Sharahbil Yakuf, c.468-480). The Jewish faith had strong roots within the Himyarite kingdom when Dhu Nuwas rose to power, and not only in Zafar but Najran also, it seems that several synagogues had been built. Najran was an oasis, with a large population of Christian Arabs, and a significant community of Jews, unlike most ·π¢ayhadic people of that zone, had only come under the authority of the Himyarite kingdom in the early fifth century, more or less around the time that a local merchant, one HayyƒÅn by name, had visited Constantinople and underwent conversion at al-Hƒ´ra, during a later journey. On his return to his native town, he began to proselytise on behalf of the new religion. It was also the seat of a Bishopric. It sheltered an oligarchy of Christian merchants which were as rich as any in Edessa or Alexandria. It had been an important stop on the spice route from Hadhramaut. Najran had been an important centre of Christianity in South Arabia and the focus of international intrigues in which economics, politics, and religion were all entangled. The bishops of Najran, who were probably Miaphysites, came to the great fairs of Mina and Ukaz, and preached Christianity, each seated on a camel as in a pulpit. The Church of Najran was called the Ka'bat Najran. (Note that several other shrines in Arabia were also called Ka'aba meaning square like building). The Ka'aba Najran at Jabal Taslal drew worshippers for some 40 years during the pre- Islamic era. The Arabian sources single out Khath'am, as a Christian tribe which used to perform the pilgrimage to the Christian Ka'aba of Najran. When Najran was occupied by Dhu Nuwas, the Ka'aba Najran was burned together with the bones of its martyrs and some 2,000 live Christians within it. Commercial reasons probably induced Christians to explore the possibilities in the area at an early period but the first attested Christian mission dates to that of Theophilos the Indian, a Christian of the Arian persuasion, who was active during the reign of Constantius II, and who was reported to have converted the Himyarites around 354/5.J. Spencer Trimingham,Islam in Ethiopia, Routledge (2004) 2013 p.40 n.4. Reign of Dhu Nuwas In the first quarter of the 6th century, a variety of records refer to a tragic episode in which a local king, Yusuf As'ar Dhu Nuwas, who had converted to Judaism and subjected the local Christian community to persecution, reportedly in retribution for the burning of a synagogue. The events comprised episodes involving a massacre of Ethiopians in a Yemen garrison, the destruction of churches, punitive expeditions in a number of regions, and attempts to constrain communities to undergo conversion to Judaism. The most infamous episode concerns the martyrdom of the Christian denizens in the great oasis of NajrƒÅn, culminating in the execution of Arethas,Jo√´lle Beaucamp, Fran√ßoise Briquel-Chatonnet, Christian Julien Robin, La pers√©cution des chr√©tiens de Nagr√¢n et la chronologie himyarite, ARAM 11:1, 1999 PP.15-83, p.15. an incident alluded to in the Qur'an, in Sura 85:4-8, where however the Christians are described as Believers martyred for their faith.Philip Wood, The Chronicle of Seert: Christian Historical Imagination in Late Antique Iraq, Oxford University Press 2013 p.251. These circumstances have a geopolitical dimension as well, in that there are indications that these Jewish communities had connections with the Iranian Sassanid kingdom, while the Christians, though Monophysites, were linked to Byzantine interests. After coming to the throne through a coup d'√©tat, Dhu Nuwas launched a campaign which swept away an Aksumite garrison in Zafar, where a church was put to the torch, and then invaded the TihƒÅma coastal lowlands where a partially Christianized population dwelt, and where he took over key centres as far as the Bab el-Mandeb. He sent one of his generals, a Jewish prince, north to Najran in order to impose an economic blockade on the oasis by cutting off the trade route to Qaryat al-Faw in eastern Arabia.Norbert Nebes, 'The Martyrs of NajrƒÅn and End of the ·∏§imyar: On the Political History of South Arabia in the Early Sixth Century,' the Angelika Neuwirth, Nicolai Sinai, Michael Marx (eds.), The Qur'ƒÅn in Context: Historical and Literary Investigations Into the Qur'ƒÅnic Milieu, BRILL 2010 pp.27-60, p.45. The Christians of Najran were massacred in 524 by the Himyarite king, Yusuf As'ar Dhu Nuwas. The Najranite Christians, like other Southern Arabian Christian communities, had close connections with the ecclesiastical authorities in Byzantium and Abyssinia. They were identified by virtue of their religion as \\"pro-Axumite\\" and \\"pro-Byzantine\\". Dhu Nuwas hoped to create, in the rich lands of Southern Arabia, a \\"Davidic\\" kingship which was independent of the Christian powers. He also considered Najran to be a Byzantine base that controlled the Red Sea trade route and did harm to the economic situation of Himyar. When Dhu Nuwas invaded, he called upon its people to abandon Christianity and embrace Judaism. When they refused, he had them thrown into burning ditches alive. Estimates of the death toll from this event range up to 20,000 in some sources. Some sources say that Dus Dhu Tha'laban from the Saba tribe was the only man able to escape the massacre of Najran, who fled to Constantinople to seek help and promptly reported everything. Fall of Dhu Nuwas Dhu Nuwas' reign, and his persecution of Christians, was brought to an end after he was defeated by an Ethiopian army. Some sources state that the emperor of Byzantium, Justin I requested his ally, the Abyssinian king Ella-Asbeha of Aksum, to invade Najran, kill Dhu-Nuwas, and annex Himyar. According to the \\"Book of Himyarites\\", Najrani Christian refugees (including one by name of Umyya) arrived in Abyssinia and requested aid from its king. In either case, the Abyssinians sent an army of 7,000 men led by Abraha al-Ashram, the Christian viceroy of the Negus of Abyssinia, and defeated Dhu Nuwas's forces and restored Christian rule in Najran. In his 524 C.E letter describing the Najran persecutions in detail, the West-Syrian debater Simeon, the bishop of Beth Arsham describes how female martyrs rushed in to join \\"our parents and brothers and sisters who have died for the sake of Christ our lord\\". In one exchange, reminiscent of the Acts of Marta and her father Pusai, a freeborn woman of Najran named Habsa bint Hayyan taunts Dhu Nuwas with the memory of her father: Literary references The persecution of Christians in Najran has left a legacy in both Christian literature as well as in the Qur'an. Simeon of Beth Arsham's Second letter preserves yet another memorably gruesome episode. After seeing her Christian kinsmen burned alive, Ruhm, a great noblewoman of Najran, brings her daughter before the Himyarite king and instructs him: \\"Cut off our heads, so that we may go join our brothers and my daughter's father.\\" The executioners comply, slaughtering her daughter and granddaughter before Ruhm's eyes and forcing her to drink her blood. The king then asks, \\"How does your daughter's blood taste to you?\\" The martyr replies, \\"Like a pure spotless offering: that is what it tasted like in my mouth and in my soul.\\" The martyrs of Najran are mentioned in the Surat al-Buruj of the Q'uran 85:4‚Äì8, where the persecutions are condemned and the steadfast believers are praised: The stories of the Najran deaths spread quickly to other Christian realms, where they were recounted in terms of heroic martyrdom for the cause of Christ. Their martyrdom led to Najran becoming a major pilgrimage centre that, for a time, rivaled Mecca to the north. The leader of the Arabs of Najran who was executed during the period of persecution, Al-Harith, was canonized by the Roman Catholic Church as St. Aretas.\\"Najran, in Yemen, was the scene, in 523, of a massacre of Ethiopians and other Christians by Jews and Arabs. A leader among the victims was the chief of the Banu Harith, St. Aretas (see: Elesbaan).\\" The Martyrdom of the Christians of Najran is celebrated in the Roman Calendar on the 24 October; in the Jacobite Menologies on 31 December; in the Arabic Feasts of the Melkites on 2 October; in the Armenian Synaxarium on the 20 October, and in the Ethiopian Senkesar on November 22. Islamic era Starting in the 7th century, Islam spread in Arabia. The Christians of Najran would interact with the Islamic Prophet Muhammad and later Muslims. Delegation to Muhammad Around 631 AD, the Islamic Prophet Muhammad began sending letter to various communities, inviting them to convert to Islam. Such a letter was also sent to the Christians of Najran; it was delivered by Khaled ibn al-Walid and Ali ibn Abi Talib. When the Christians did not convert, Muhammad sent Al-Mughira to explain Islam further to Christians of Najran. In response, the Christians sent a delegation of 60 people (including 45 scholars) to visit Prophet Muhammad in Medina. Among them were Abdul Masih of Bani Kinda, their chief, and Abdul Harith, bishop of Bani Harith. Muhammad permitted Christians to pray in his mosque, which they did turning towards the east. When the delegation arrived, the Prophet Muhammad allowed them to pray in his mosque. Some Muslims were reportedly uncomfortable with Muhammad allowing the Christians to pray in a mosque. The Christians are said to have prayed facing the East. Muhammad also provided them with a place to stay. The Christians delegation tried to convert Muhammad to Christianity and the two sides entered into a debate. Muhammad concluded that some Christian teachings were incompatible with Islam and that Islam was the true religion. Though both sides failed to convince the other, they nevertheless worked out a mutually acceptable relationship, and entered a treaty of peace. The Treaty of Najran guaranteed to the Christians security for \\"their lives, their religion and their property\\". It gave Christians freedom of religion, stipulating that there would be no interference in the practice of Christianity, nor would any cross be destroyed. While the Christians were required to pay a tax (jizya) they would not have to pay a tithe (ushr). The tax on them was not to exceed the means of a Christian. Muhammad also stated \\"The Muslims must not abandon the Christians, neglect them, and leave them without help and assistance since I have made this pact with them on behalf of Allah.\\" The treaty was significant politically and economically. By leaving local leaders intact, Muhammad cultivated new allies and facilitated tax collection. Umar bin Al- Khattab There are reports that the second Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab ordered Christians of Najran to vacate the city and emigrate out of the Arabian peninsula, or accept a Jizya tax. However, the historicity of this is disputed, and there is historical evidence that Christians continued to live in the area for at least 200 more years. It may be that the orders of Umar were not carried out or might have applied only to Christians living in Najran itself, not to those settled round about. Some migrated to Syria, likely in the district of Trachonitis (the Lajat plain) and around the extant city of Najran, Syria; but the greater part settled in the vicinity of Al-Kufa in predominantly Christian Southern Iraq, where the colony of Al-Najraniyyah long maintained the memory of their expatriation. Najran accord of 897 The Christian community of Najran still had considerable political weight in the late ninth century. According to a Yemeni Arab source, the first Zaydite Imam of Yemen, al-Hadi Ila l-Haqq Yahya ibn al-Hussain (897‚Äì911) concluded an accord with the Christians and the Jews of the oasis on 897, at the time of the foundation of the Zaydite principality. A second Yemeni source alludes to the Christians of Najran in muharram 390 (999‚Äì1000). The oasis was still one third Christian and one third Jewish, according to the testimony of the Persian traveller, Ibn al-Mujawir. The last evidence of the presence of Christianity in Northern Yemen of which Najran used to belong to, dates back to the 13th century. Decline Eventually the Old Najran which was Christian disappeared, and is now represented by Al-Ukhdood, a desolate village, while another the Najran which is Islamic, has now appeared in its vicinity.

Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J. Its specific name kelaarti honors the physician-zoologist E.F. Kelaart. Legge's hawk-eagle is a medium-sized eagle and fairly large-sized raptor. The typical adult has brown upperparts and pale underparts, with barring on the undersides of the flight feathers and tail. The breast and belly are heavily streaked. The wings are broad with a curved trailing edge, and are held in a shallow V in flight. Sexes are similar, but young birds are often whiter-headed. A Legge's hawk-eagle photographed in Sri Lanka. Legge's hawk-eagle was formerly considered to be a subspecies of the mountain hawk-eagle, but it is smaller and has unstreaked buff underwing coverts.

It stars Angela Lansbury and Keith Andes.  Plot summary  Down-on-his-luck Los Angeles architect and builder Edward Shaw (Keith Andes) is approached by Doris Hillman (Angela Lansbury) with a business proposal: buying land together, on which he would build houses that she would then sell, using her experience as a former real estate broker. Her husband, Gus Hillman, a wealthy businessman, would be willing to contribute half a million dollars as capital for the venture. Doris quickly seems interested in more than a purely professional relationship. Shaw starts an affair with her and accepts the business offer. However, an accidental discovery leaves him convinced that the Hillmans' interest lies less in the long-term profits of the venture than in the $175,000 key man insurance policy he took on himself as a precondition for the deal, and that an attempt on his life is imminent. Madge, the younger sister of Doris, develops a romantic interest in Shaw as well. Without knowing what Doris has planned, she reveals to Shaw that her sister was married previously to a man who died in Wyoming when his car crashed over a bridge. Shaw ends up drugged by Gus Hillman and barely keeps his car from going off a cliff. The police are skeptical about his story and the insurance company refuses to cancel the policy, Hillman having portrayed Shaw as a man who is trying to steal his wife. Madge teams with Shaw to try to foil her sister's scheme, but Doris lures him to a mountain cabin and shoots him. A wounded Shaw sees both Hillmans struggle then fall to their deaths through a clifftop doorway, just minutes before Madge and the cops arrive.

All these houses were listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 5, 1987. History During the boom years of the 1920s, as immigration and tourism to the Territory of Hawaii from the West Coast of the United States increased sharply, many new private homes for the growing middle class showed the design influence of the California bungalows or Mock Tudor English cottages so popular in the Continental United States. One of the most influential architects in Honolulu, Hart Wood, had published a series of articles extolling the appropriateness of the English cottage style for suburban living. In 1920, he moved his practice from San Francisco to Honolulu, where he designed three of the fifteen exemplary English Tudor-French Norman Cottages built during 1923-1932 that were added to the National Register of Historic Places on 5 June 1987. The Tudor features include asymmetrical, multilevel floor plans and projections, half-timber and stucco facades, small-paned casement windows, and roofs that are either high- pitched or rounded to resemble thatching. Although some of the same features mark grand Tudor mansions like the Charles M. Cooke, Jr., House, these cottages are much more modest structures of one to three stories, built of frame or masonry, with more playful or romantic elements evoking imagined \\"olde English\\" or French Norman antecedents. The interiors are designed to be cozy and intimate, with much more wall space than window openings, often with fireplaces and open-beam ceilings. California regional styles also influenced new public buildings in the Territory. Spanish Colonial Revival and, more broadly, Mediterranean Revival architecture can be seen in Honolulu Hale, President William McKinley High School, the Fire Stations of Oahu, and numerous other public buildings erected during this period.

His poetry was in the objectivist style, dependent on evocative natural imagery, presented in terse but beautifully layered poems. Ralph J. Mills Jr. in his study.(photo by Helen Harvey Mills) Life Ralph Joseph Mills, Jr. was born in Chicago, Illinois on December 16, 1931. His father was Ralph J. Mills, President of the Mills Novelty Company in Chicago (inventors and makers of vending, gaming and slot machines, one of the largest in the country) and his mother was Eileen McGuire, whose family owned Beloit Dairy in Chicago. He and his sister Anne Mills Canter grew up in Chicago and Lake Forest, Illinois. His first job was with his family‚Äôs Mills Novelty Company in Chicago, in the summer 1950, working the lowest position at the factory, hauling compressors and returned machinery. He graduated from Lake Forest College, and Northwestern University, with a master's degree and PhD. He attended Oxford University, and taught at the University of Chicago, from 1959 to 1965. He taught at the University of Illinois at Chicago from 1965 until his retirement in 1997.http://poetryandpoetsinrags.blogspot.com/2007/08/poetic-obituaries- english-professor-at.html In 1959 he married the former Helen Harvey, a descendant of Fred Harvey, the owner of the Harvey House chain of restaurants, hotels, and other hospitality industry businesses alongside railroads in the western and southwestern United States. They had two daughters, Natalie Mills Bontumasi and Brett Mills, and a son, Julian Mills. He was also the grandfather to Lucian Bontumasi and Eliot Bontumasi. He died in Chicago on August 18, 2007. His papers are held at the University of Chicago Library (https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/scrc/findingaids/view.php?eadid=ICU.SPCL.MILLSRJ). Education Ralph J. Mills, Jr. graduated from Lake Forest Academy in 1950, Lake Forest College in 1954, Northwestern University in 1956 with an MA in English. He also attended Oxford University from August 1956 - May 1957. Mills later received a PhD from Northwestern in 1965 (under Richard Ellmann, noted scholar of James Joyce and W.B. Yeats) and an Honorary Degree in Letters from Lake Forest College, 2004. Professor and Critic Ralph Mills Jr., was an acclaimed poet, scholar and professor. A teacher and critic known for the precision of his observations and the generosity of his praise, Mills first taught at University of Chicago, 1959‚Äì1965, and was also Associate Chairman of the Committee on Social Thought. He then taught modern literature, poetry and creative writing in the English Department at University of Illinois at Chicago for thirty-two years, 1965‚Äì1997, where he was the first director of graduate studies in English. At UIC, he taught a range of classes, but in later years focused on poetry. He had the ability to break down complex poems and \\"didn't demand his students be carbon copies of who he was,\\" said Michael Anania, a poet and colleague of Mr. Mills' at UIC. \\"He was an absolutely dedicated intellectual, but you'd never hear any statement that seemed intellectually immodest or off-putting.\\" His literary ambitions dated to his college years at Lake Forest College; he studied English and published his early work in Tusitala, the College‚Äôs literary magazine. After graduation, Mills earned an MA and PhD in English from Northwestern University and studied at Oxford. He led a distinguished academic career, teaching first at the University of Chicago and later becoming the first director of graduate studies in English at the University of Illinois‚ÄìChicago, where he taught modern literature and creative writing for more than 30 years. Mills committed himself to poetry scholarship early in his career; he edited the letters of the great American poet Theodore Roethke and the notebooks of David Ignatow. His interests were diverse ‚Äî including poets such as Wallace Stevens and William Butler Yeats, experimental writers such as Samuel Beckett, and French men of letters such as Ren√© Char and Andr√© Michaux. Mills‚Äôs scholarly essays and reviews have appeared in the most distinguished literary and academic journals, but he has also written with great verve and clarity for a popular audience in the Chicago Sun-Times. He edited the famous anthology Contemporary American Poetry, which introduced a generation of American college students to the best contemporary poetry. Between 1963 and 1975, he published numerous critical articles, monographs, eight books of criticism and two volumes of essays on contemporary American poets, as well as edited Theodore Roethke‚Äôs letters and selected prose, and David Ignatow‚Äôs Notebooks. His essays and criticism concentrated on 20th Century poets such as Roethke, Edith Sitwell and Wallace Stevens. His critical work was used in numerous classrooms and workshops over the years and reprinted in textbooks and a compilation of his well-received criticism, Essays on Poetry, was published in 2003. Within the world of Chicago writers and academics, he was widely respected for his piercing intellect and the breadth of his knowledge. He had a great enthusiasm for poetry and never wrote a negative review. \\"He enjoyed more poets, more poems, more criticism of poetry than anyone I know,\\" said novelist and former University of Chicago professor Richard Stern. \\"Mills was a rare beacon of benevolence in a field where most participants love to try to spike each others' eyes out,\\" Stern said. He was also poetry reviewer for the Chicago Daily News, Chicago Sun Times, Poetry, Christian Century and American Poetry Review in the late 1960s. Poet A highly respected and published critic, Mills was a distinguished poet in his own right. His focus turned more seriously to his own poetry when he was in his early thirties, prompted by the death of his father. Much of his poetry was in the objectivist style, \\"dependent on images, tersely presented,\\" said fellow poet Michael Anania. His command of the written word was always paramount, but his work got tighter over the years. \\"His poems were not always easy to parse, some of the thoughts he was trying to get across were complicated thoughts,\\" said novelist Ward Just, a classmate of Mr. Mills' at Lake Forest Academy. He worked in a third- floor den of his home, writing in longhand and revising frequently before moving to a typewriter. He published thirteen well-received volumes of poetry and won such nationally recognized awards as the Carl Sandburg Award in 1983 and the William Carlos Williams Prize in 2000. His final selected of poems, Grasses Standing, appeared in 2000 as a capstone to a truly impressive creative career. It won the William Carlos Williams Prize from the Poetry Society of America.

The group was initially equipped with a few Douglass Dauntless and Curtis Helldiver dive bombers. The group gained some P-39 Airacobras before they left Drew. The group was redesignated as the 405th Fighter Bomber Group on 15 August 1943. In September 1943 the group moved to Walterboro, South Carolina. In Walterboro the group was outfitted with the original \\"razorback\\" design P-47 Thunderbolts. In February 1944 the group moved by train to a point of embarkation (POE) camp near New York City. The group soon embarked the RMS Mauritania for transport to England. After six days at sea, two of them in hurricane conditions, the group disembarked in Liverpool. The group traveled by train to Southampton then via lorrie to Christchurch, Dorset.Henkels, pp. 78‚Äì111. From March to 29 June 1944, the 405th operated out of the RAF Christchurch. After setting up camp and training over England, the group began combat operations over France. During this period their primary task was ground attack ahead of the coming Operation Overlord invasion of Normandy. The group disrupted German positions and transportation infrastructure. Train locomotives were a favorite target. The group destroyed the Seine River bridge at Mantes-Gassicourt, northeast of Paris, just before the invasion, to inhibit movement of German materiel.Henkels, p. 113. The group was grounded during the 6 June invasion activities because Allied command was concerned that inexperienced anti-aircraft batteries would mistake P-47s for the German Focke-Wulf Fw 190. The 405th resumed flying on 10 June, providing close air support to the beachhead. On 18 June 1944,Wyllie lists this change as May. the group was redesignated to the 405th Fighter Group. A few weeks after the invasion, the 405th packed up and moved to a POE near Southampton.Henkels, pp. 161‚Äì164. While encamped at Christchurch, the Group officers bivouacked in Bure Homage, an English manor adjacent to the airfield that was requisitioned by the British Ministry of Defence for the war. The group's most notable action was the destruction of an entire German armored division near the town of Avaranches , France on 29 July 1944. After immobilizing leading and trailing elements of the 3-mile (4.8 km) long column, the rest of the tanks and trucks were systematically destroyed with multiple sorties. The 405th also accepted the surrender of the highly decorated Luftwaffe ace, Hans-Ulrich Rudel and his officers at the end of the war. Cold War Republic F-84F-35-RE Thunderstreak 52-7043 North American F-100D-40-NH Super Sabre 55-2768 The 405th Fighter-Bomber Wing and Group were activated on 1 December 1952 at Godman Air Force Base, Kentucky. The 405th replaced the 108th Fighter-Bomber Group which had been called to active federal service for the Korean War and was returned to the New Jersey Air National Guard and assumed its mission, equipment and personnel. The group's 509th, 510th, and 511th Fighter-Bomber Squadrons also replaced the Air National Guard 141st, 149th and 153d Fighter- Bomber Squadrons. Initially equipped with F-47Ds and F-47N Thunderbolts inherited from the Air National Guard, the 405th was the last active duty USAF Thunderbolt fighter group. On 1 May 1953, the F-47s were withdrawn and sent to AMARC, and the 405th was reassigned to Langley AFB, Virginia due to the programmed closing of Godman AFB on 1 September. At Langley, the 405th replaced the provisional 4430th Air Base Wing and was re-equipped with Republic F-84F Thunderstreak jet aircraft. Also attached to the group was the 422d Bombardment Squadron with B-26 Invader light bombers (1 May ‚Äì 20 December 1953) and the 429th Air Refueling Squadron (19 July 1954 ‚Äì 8 October 1957) with KB-29 Superfortress tankers. The group was heavily involved with operational training of TAC Thunderstreak pilots, both in gunnery and tactical bombardment, along with providing firepower demonstrations. The wing was committed to the TAC concept of the Composite Air Strike Force (CASF), which was, in part, to be prepared for rapid worldwide deployments. In September 1955 the 405th participated in Operation Mobile Able, a transatlantic exercise from Langley AFB to RAF Burtonwood, England. This was followed by Operation Sharkbait, which used McGuire AFB, New Jersey as a staging base en route to RAF Wethersfield, England. Replaced F-84Fs with North American F-100 Super Sabre in December 1956, becoming TAC's first F-100 unit. Inactivated on 8 October 1957 when 405th FBW adopted Tri-Deputate organization plan and assigned all operational squadrons directly to the Wing. Expeditionary operations Reactivated as a provisional Expeditionary Operations Group after the 9/11/2001 terrorist attacks assigned to the 405th Air Expeditionary Wing, as part of Air Combat Command United States Air Forces Central. Assigned B-1B Lancer and possibly B-52H Stratofortress aircraft, along with various tankers. The unit engaged in combat operations during Operation Enduring Freedom in 2001, and Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. Aircraft and personnel were presumably drawn from both CONUS-based units as well as units assigned to USAFE or PACAF on regular deployment cycles. During the first phase of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the 405th launched 10 aircraft and struck 240 planned targets with Global Positioning System-guided JDAMS 2,000-pound bombs. Since then, the unit conducted almost daily bombing missions as well as responding to calls for close air support from ground units.

It was opened in 2001.  Overview  The main route of the Rothaarsteig trail runs from Brilon (NW), mainly in a southerly direction over the Kahler Asten (NW) to Dillenburg (HE). Most of the Rothaarsteig is located in the Rothaargebirge Nature Park. It runs mainly along the watershed between the rivers Rhine and Weser over the heavily forested mountains of the Rothaargebirge and through its valleys and uses the existing network of metalled and unmetalled forest tracks. In an extremely sparsely populated region it links hills and places of interest such as the Bruchhauser Steine, the Langenberg, the Kahler Asten, the Rhine-Weser Tower, the Ginsburg and several sources of major rivers like the Ruhr, Eder, Sieg and Lahn. Between Schmallenberg and Bad Berleburg the Rothaarsteig meets the Waldskulpturenweg. Despite its route inside a range of high hills, the Rothaarsteig generally easy to walk. It passes several towns including Winterberg, through which it runs.  Marking  The signpost symbol for the Rothaarsteig is a white \\"R\\" on its side on a red background. The paths leading to the trail from the valleys along the way have the same sign but in black on a yellow background.  Route   Main trail  The 154.80 kilometre long main trail of the Rothaarsteig runs over mountains, past springs and natural and cultural monuments and through nature reserves. These include, from north to south (with heights above Normalnull; NN): The Rothaarsteig starts at Brilon (450 m) and runs southwards past the source of the M√∂hne (500 m) to the Borbergskirchof (629 m; at Borberg, 669 m), over the Ginsterkopf (663 m) and past the Bruchhauser Steinen (up to 756 m) to the Richtplatz (old Thing site for the Electorate of Cologne; 762.6 m; near the Hoppernkopf, 805 m). The walking trail then runs over the Langenberg (843.2 m), the highest point in North Rhine-Westphalia, and through the Neuer Hagen nature reserve, whereby it runs past the source of the Hoppecke (785 m) up the Clemensberg (839.2 m) and past the Hillekopf (804.9 m) to the northeast. The route then continues on to the K√ºstelberg (666.1 m; which is the source of the river Orke) to the Wagenschmier quarry (645 m), then past the source of the Ruhr (666.5 m) on the Ruhrkopf (695.7 m) and on in a southwesterly direction to Winterberg (670 m), where it passes the southern portal of the Herrloh Tunnel at Herrloh (732,9 m), 200 m southeast of the St.-Georg-Schanze. The path then runs past the mountains of Poppenberg (745.5 m) and Bremberg (809 m) to the Kahler Asten (841.9 m), on which the Asten Tower (an observation tower) and e. g. the source of the river Lenne may be found (819 m). From the Lenne spring the Rothaarsteig runs by the high villages of Lennepl√§tze, Neuastenberg, Langewiese and Hoheleye to Albrechtsplatz (728.6 m) and past the source of the Friede (740 m; a tributary of the Odeborn) to the Heidenstock (752.2 m). About 500 m southwest of the Heidenstock the Rothaarsteig divides into separate hill and valley courses: The Bergweg (\\"mountain path\\"), which is part of the main Rothaarsteig trail, crosses a section of the Waldskulpturenweg, which combines with it in places. Initially it runs in a southerly direction past the hamlet of K√ºhhude (697.2 m; a northern suburb of Bad Berleburg) and the Saukopf (715.5 m) to the suspension bridge near the source of the Hochgelmke Siepen (680,5 m; in the catchment area of the Lenne tributary, the Latrop). Then the Bergweg runs westwards over the Gro√üer Kopf (740.3 m) to the Millionenbank (632.4 m), where it rejoins the Talweg or valley path. The Talweg (13.7 km long), also called the Hochsauerlandvariante (\\"High Sauerland Variant\\"), is the most important branch of the Rothaarsteig. It runs initially westwards past a war cemetery (Soldatengrab, 711.7 m) and the cultural monument of the Wegsperre (715.9 m) to the village of Schanze (700 m; east-southeastern suburb of Schmallenberg). It then runs in a more or less southeastern direction and then west again in the Grubental valley along the Grubensiepen (tributary of the Latrop) and its tributary, the Schladebach, past the Altarstein (heathen sacrifice site; 536.2 m) and the natural monument known as the Dicke Eiche (\\"Fat Oak\\", 482.7 m) to the village of Latrop in the Latrop valley (430 m; southeastern municipality of Schmallenberg). Thereafter the Talweg runs south around the neighbouring mountains of Gro√üe- (610.2 m) and Kleine Bamicke (659.8 m) to the Millionenbank (632.4 m), where it meets the Bergweg. From the Millionenbank the main Rothaarsteig path continues westwards via Jagdhaus (650 m; southern municipality of Schmallenberg), where the Kapellenw√§ldchen natural monument is found at Heidkopf (665.9 m), to the Trudes Sonnenbank (657.3 m) mountain hut and past the source of the Somborn (680 m; in the Eder catchment area), which is located on the southeastern slopes of the H√§rdler (755.8 m), to the crosstracks of Potsdamer Platz (678.1 m). The walking path then runs past the refuge hut on the Margaretenstein (685 m) to the Rhine-Weser Tower (680 m; observation tower) on the Westerberg (684.6 m). From the Rhine-Weser Tower the Rothaarsteig runs in a southerly direction to the source region of the Schwarzbach (right source stream of the Eder tributary, the R√∂spe). Just under 1 km further southeast it runs past the Panorama-Park Sauerland before following the valley of the Schwarzbach. After crossing that stream the walking trail runs along the Schwarzbach tributary, the Habecker Bach, to its origin and then continues to the mountain hut (621.1 m) at Rastplatz Hochheide. Continuing through the nature reserve of Haberg (625.4 m; Heinsberger Hochheide) it runs over the 637.9 m high crest of the closed Heinsberg Tunnel (1,303 m long) and then heads south to the Dreiherrnstein (673.9 m), which is a northeastern subpeak of the Riemen (677.7 m). The Rothaarsteig runs past the summit of the Riemen about 150 m to the east to the valley of the Elberndorfer Bach (a western Eder tributary), which it crosses in a westerly direction. Next it runs a few metres east of the Ferndorf spring (600 m), and passes, further south, the cultural monuments of Schrammer Heide and Schanze and runs in a southwesterly direction ‚àí over the Schlo√überg Tunnel (270 m long) of the Rothaar Railway‚àí to the ruins of Ginsburg (587.,6 m). Thereafter the Rothaarsteig runs eastwards over the Giller (653.5 m; with its Giller Tower) to L√ºtzel (575.1 m) southeast of Hilchenbach. Next the trail runs along the Eder to its source (620 m) and over the old coal road (Kohlenstra√üe, maximum height 640 m) to Waldheim in Benfe, south of Erndtebr√ºck, where it crosses the Eder tributary, the Benfe (568 m). Bordering the eastern edge of the village of Gro√üenbach, west of Bad Laasphe, where the Rothaarsteig swings towards the southwest for a few hundred metres, it runs to the source of the Rhine tributary, the Sieg (603 m), where it crosses part of the Eisenstra√üe. After that the Rothaarsteig runs in a southerly direction parallel to and, in places, along the Eisenstra√üe to the source of the Ilm (622 m; tributary of the Lahn) and then past the origin of the Lahn (605 m) itself in Lahnhof (a village near Nenkersdorf which is in turn part of the borough of Netphen) eastwards to the Ilsesource (620 m). It then runs over the Jagdberg (675.9 m), along a section of the border with the neighbouring state of Hesse and past the Kaffeebuche natural monument (590 m) to the source of the Dill (560 m) which lies in Hesse on the Haincher H√∂he (606 m). Passing over the Tiefenrother H√∂he (551 m) near Wilgersdorf on the state border and then the eastern subpeak of the Kalteiche (579,3 m), where the trail bends southeast to the Lucaseiche natural monument (440 m), the Rothaarsteig finally reaches Hesse. Through Rodenbach (310 m), north of Haiger, it continues to Manderbach (305 m), north of Dillenburg, and over the Dillenburg Galgenberg (302 m), running past the Wilhelm Tower (260 m) before finally ending in Dillenburg (233 m).  Towns and villages  The Rothaarsteig runs through or past the following towns and villages (in alphabetical order): { width = \\"180\\" * Bad Berleburg * Bad Laasphe * Breitscheid * Brilon * Burbach * Dillenburg width = \\"200\\" valign=top * Dietzh√∂lztal * Erndtebr√ºck * Haiger * Hilchenbach * Kirchhundem * K√ºstelberg valign=top * Netphen * Olsberg * Schmallenberg * Willingen * Wilnsdorf * Winterberg |}  Cycling the trail  The use of the Rothaarsteig by bicycle is problematic but possible. The gradients reach 15 % in many places. In addition there are stretches that have been damaged or turned to mud by forestry vehicles. Bicycles therefore need to be cross-country capable and the fitness of the cyclist sufficient for the challenge. Difficult sections of the path may sometimes be bypassed on parallel running country roads.  Rothaarsteig Marathon  Every October the Rothaarsteig Marathon starts in Fleckenberg and involves runners climbing a height difference of 838 metres. The first marathon took place in 2003. In addition to the full marathon distance, a half-marathon is also run.Homepage des Rothaarsteig-Marathons  Transport to the area  The Rothaarsteig is more or less accessible on public transport. The bus and railway lines that run parallel to it or cross it have at least hourly services. The following places have a railway station or are part of a good bus network, but in some cases are several kilometres from the Rothaarsteig: * Brilon on the Upper Ruhr Valley Railway * Willingen on the Upland Railway (Kurhessen Railway) from Brilon to Korbach * Winterberg on the Bestwig and Winterberg railway * Schmallenberg on bus routes S40 and 367 * Altenhundem, Haiger and Dillenburg on the Ruhr-Sieg Railway * Bad Berleburg and Hilchenbach on the Rothaar Railway * Erndtebr√ºck on the Upper Lahn Valley Railway and Rothaar Railway * L√ºtzel (part of Hilchenbach) on the Rothaar Railway * Feudingen on the Upper Lahn Valley Railway via Bad Laasphe to Marburg  References   External links  * Rothaarsteig * Hessian Rothaarsteig * Information about the Rothaarsteig, conditions on the trail, accommodation, and other facilities Category:Hiking trails in Hesse Category:Hiking trails in North Rhine- Westphalia Category:Hiking trails in Rhineland-Palatinate Category:Middle Hesse ","title":"Rothaarsteig"},{"id":"24167840","title":"Junior Etou"},{"id":"24167899","text":"Dynastes satanas, the Satanas Beetle, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Scarabaeidae; the name is sometimes misspelled as \\"satanus\\" http://museum.unl.edu/research/entomology/Guide/Scarabaeoidea/Scarabaeidae/Dynastinae/Dynastinae- Tribes/Dynastini/Dynastes/D-satanus/Dsatanus.html.

The coalition consists of 25 other youth organisations, which includes the National Union of Students amongst many. The organisation aims \\"to build a generation-wide movement to solve the climate crisis, through uniting diverse youth organisations around this common challenge\\" Internationally, the coalition is part of the Global Youth Climate Movement.  History  In 2004, organisations, which would later form the Youth Climate Movement, began to come together. Following on from the formation of the Canadian Youth Climate Coalition in September 2006, the Australian Youth Climate Coalition formed in November 2006 with 27 youth organisations from across the nation at a founding youth summit. The Australian Youth Climate Coalition is a non-partisan, non-profit coalition with the aim of \\"educating, inspiring, empowering and mobilising an entire generation in the struggle for climate justice and a clean energy future.\\" In 2009, the then Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner awarded the Australian Youth Climate Coalition's co-founders, Amanda McKenzie and Anna Rose, as well as the current National Director, Ellen Sandell, with the Environment Minister's Young Environmentalist of the Year Award for their efforts.  Campaigns  Demonstration in Melbourne (2009) Every year since the formation of the Australian Youth Climate Coalition, the organisation has sent a youth delegation to the United Nations Conferences on Climate Change to advocate on behalf of young people. For the 2008 conference in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland, the Australian delegation travelled through ten nations to reach the summit. Similarly in December 2009, the organisation sent a second youth delegation to the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference along with other members of the Youth Climate Movement. Power Shift is the name of an annual youth summit which was held in the United States for the first time in 2007. Two years later in 2009, the Australian Youth Climate Coalition, in partnership with the University of Western Sydney, GetUp and Greenpeace, organised the Australian Powershift Conference on 11 to 13 July 2009. The summit attracted 1,5000 young people. Guests included former Vice President of the USA Al Gore, the swimmer Ian Thorpe and the actress Brooke Satchwell. The event concluded with a gathering outside the Sydney Opera House. The AYCC ran regional Power Shift in 2010 in Adelaide, Canberra and Geelong. In 2011 Power Shift was held in Brisbane and Perth with 1000 young people. The summits included a range of speakers, events and workshops. In 2013 AYCC will host Australia's largest ever youth climate summit, in Melbourne from 13‚Äì15 July. Youth Decide In September 2009 the AYCC organised Youth Decide with World Vision Australia. It was Australia's first national youth climate vote. 2,000 volunteers ran 330 Youth Decide events with over 37,500 young people voting. In September 2011 the AYCC held a second Youth Decide, giving young people the opportunity to vote on the renewable energy targets they wanted the Federal Government to set. 2010 Election Campaign During the 2010 election campaign the AYCC mobilised hundreds of young people to put climate change back on the political agenda. This included automated phone calls to politicians, hanging out scorecards rating the three main political parties climate policies and the very popular climate elephant, which was featured widely in the media and is now used as an example of excellent grassroots election campaigning. Meet Your Member In 2011 the AYCC ran a campaign called Meet Your Member. This involved young people from all across the country meeting with their local MP or Senator and express their view on Climate Change. Local volunteers also collected hundreds of signatures on postcards which they presented to MP's in the meetings. Walk for Solar In 2012 100 young people walked 328 km over 15 days from Port Augusta to Adelaide. This major event, organised by the AYCC, was part of the wider Repower Port Augusta campaign, pushing for investment in Australia's first concentrated solar thermal plant in Port Augusta. The event gained significant national media and political attention. The chief spokesperson for the project was Daniel Spencer.

Predominantly in the United Kingdom, nude calendars are produced to raise money for charity.  Types   Calendars featuring pin- up models  Commercial advertising on calendars started in the late 19th century and has often been linked to pictures or photographs of pin-up models. The products being advertised may be incorporated via product placement in the pictures themselves or separate via logos and corporate in-house style. Calendars featuring female nudes became a common feature in workplaces which were predominantly male (e.g. garages, car dealerships, etc.), although many employers have banned or restricted their display considering them a form of sex discrimination. An example is the Pirelli Calendar.  Sports nude calendars  Some sports teams have produced nude calendars, often to raise their profile or increase funding. Examples include the Australian women's football team prior to the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, the Canadian cross- country ski team in 2001 and 2002, and a group of Canadian women biathletes in 2008.  Charity nude calendars  The first nude charity calendar was made by a group of middle-aged Englishwomen, members of a local branch of the Women's Institute, who were posing nude to raise funds for Leukaemia Research. The calendar was released in 1999, and became an international sensation, and also inspired the movie Calendar Girls. Following this lead, charity nude calendars proliferated in the 2000s. Proceeds usually go to various health or social causes. Participants may include artists, celebrities, sportsmen and sportswomen, firefighters, military forces, the police, or members of a group such as farmers, Women's Institute members who wish to raise funds for a chosen charity.

Opening in 1851, it was one of the first institutions of higher learning in the United States to be founded west of the Mississippi River.Conley, 56 Creation After removal to Indian Territory, the Cherokee Nation worked to rebuild its institutions and society. In October 1846, Chief John Ross submitted a proposal to the Cherokee National Council to pass legislation for the creation of institutions of higher learning for both Cherokee men and women. On November 26, 1846 the Council passed a bill stating that, \\"Whereas, the improvement of the moral and intellectual condition of our people is contemplated by the Constitution, and whereas, we are now in possession of means sufficient to carry out, to a further degree of maturity, the National system of education already commenced.\\"Foreman, 393 In a ceremony on October 28, 1847 the first cornerstone of the male seminary, containing books and documents, was laid by Chief Ross. Before the school opened, representatives from the Cherokee Nation visited New England seeking teachers and recruited faculty from Yale University, Mount Holyoke College, and Newton Theological Seminary.Agnew, Brad. \\"Cherokee Male and Female Seminaries.\\" Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. (retrieved 30 August 2009) $80,000 of tribal funds was allocated for the construction of Cherokee Male Seminary and the Cherokee Female Seminary.Foreman, 408 1851‚Äì1856 The Cherokee Male Seminary opened its doors to 27 new students on May 6, 1851. The boarding school occupied a three- story red brick building on a campus located southwest of Tahlequah, Indian Territory. Curriculum included English grammar, composition, arithmetic, algebra, elocution, astronomy, botany, economics, geology, geography, history, philosophy, zoology, and language classes in Greek, Latin, French, and German. To gain admission, prospective students had to pass a two-day examination. The tribe paid for the students' tuition and expenses. By 1856, 13 men graduated from the Male Seminary. New students were not accepted in the fall of 1856. Reopening of the school was delayed until the 1870s due to the effects of the American Civil War. 1870s After the war, the school was reopened in the 1870s. Students had to pay for their room and board, and the Cherokee Nation opened enrollment to men from other Native American tribes. At the time \\"the Cherokee Nation had a better common school system than either Arkansas or Missouri,\\" writes historian Grant Foreman. Closing Under the assimilationist Curtis Act of 1898, the US federal government systematically dismantled Cherokee tribal institutions, including the Cherokee Male Seminary. The tribe continued using the school building as a co-educational facility after Oklahoma statehood, but it burnt down in 1910. The last students graduated that year, with commencement ceremonies being held at Northeastern State Normal School. The Cherokee Nation has not operated a tribal college since then.

He took an M.A. at St John's College, Issue 31497 Oxford,London Gazette then reading theology at Ely Theological College where he completed his studies in 1885. Ordination and initial appointments He was ordained Deacon at Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, on 20 December 1885. Issue 31636 The following year he was ordained Priest, also at Oxford Cathedral. Vincent‚Äôs first posting was as Curate of Aylesbury in 1886, followed by a move in 1889 to Ely Theological College as Chaplain and Lecturer, remaining there until 1892.Crockford's Clerical Directory 1908 p1470: London, Horace Cox, 1908 Bloemfontein In 1892 Vincent accepted an appointment as Dean of Bloemfontein in South Africa. He had the misfortune, as Lewis puts it, to be Dean during the Anglo-Boer War of 1899-1902, a centre of much fighting. He in fact served for the duration of the war as Vicar General when the See was vacant. Just months before the outbreak of war, in June 1899, he had married Evelyn Templer of Lynbridge, Devon. In 1902 Vincent and his young bride returned to England, where he took up the Rectorship of the parish of Clapham, remaining there until 1906. But \\"Africa has a strange magnetism,\\" as Lewis says, and the Vincents went out again to the Orange Free State where John Ranulph Vincent became Rector of Bethlehem. As Vicar General, again, in 1908, Vincent presided at the dedication of the new St Cyprian's Church in Kimberley, soon to be elevated to being a cathedral. Grahamstown Vincent was asked to accept the post of Dean of Grahamstown, in 1912. He died of typhoid in Grahamstown just two years later and was buried at the Old Cemetery there. He was known in Grahamstown as a keen Freemason and True Templer. Bell-ringer J. R. Vincent was a competent change-ringer, as documented by Lewis: he had distinguished himself among the ringing members of the Oxford University Society of Change Ringers in his student days. In February 1914 Vincent, together with the Revd (later Canon) G. H. Ridout of Johannesburg and Percy Holt, rang extents of Grandsire Doubles on handbells in the Deanery at Grahamstown.

It belongs to the genus Xiphorhynchus in the woodcreeper subfamily, Dendrocolaptinae. It is usually regarded as a subspecies of the ocellated woodcreeper (X. ocellatus). It is named after Johann Jakob von Tschudi, the Swiss explorer and naturalist who first described the bird. Taxonomy It was initially described as a species by Johann Jakob von Tschudi in 1844. He named it Dendrocolaptes Chunchotambo but it was later moved to the genus Xiphorhynchus. It was later lumped into the ocellated woodcreeper (X. ocellatus) but Aleixo (2002) recommended splitting the species based on a study of mitochondrial DNA which showed that the ocellated woodcreeper was more closely related to the chestnut-rumped woodcreeper (X. pardalotus) than to Tschudi's woodcreeper.Aleixo, Alexandre (2002) Molecular systematics and the role of the \\"V√°rzea\\"-\\"Terra-firme\\" ecotone in the diversification of Xiphorhynchus woodcreepers (Aves: Dendrocolaptidae).

There are two or three subspecies of Tschudi's woodcreeper group: X. o. chunchotambo, X. o. brevirostris and perhaps X. o. napensis. Description It is a medium-sized woodcreeper, 20‚Äì21 cm in length.Schulenberg, Thomas S.; Stotz, Douglas F.; Lane, Daniel F.; O'Neill John P. & Parker, Theodore A. III (2007) Field Guide to the Birds of Peru, Christopher Helm, London. The bill is fairly long and slightly curved. The plumage is mostly brown, becoming more rufous on the rump, wings and tail. The bird has a buff throat, buff spots on the crown and breast, fine buff streaks on the back and a black moustachial stripe.Ridgely, Robert S. & Guy Tudor (1994) The Birds of South America, volume 2: the Suboscine Passerines, University of Texas Press. The song is a descending series of staccato notes. It calls include a short descending whistle, a quavering liquid call and a dry rattle. Distribution and habitat It is found along the east Andean slope and adjacent Amazonian lowlands from southern Colombia south through Ecuador and Peru to northern Bolivia and far south-western Brazil. X. o. chunchotambo occurs in central Peru, X. o. brevirostris in south-east Peru, northern Bolivia and south-western Brazil, and X. o. napensis in southern Colombia, eastern Ecuador and north-east Peru.CBRO (2009).

Up to 1917 he wrote over 130 works and established himself as an important composer of the neo-Russian style with an influence on choral composers such as Sergei Rachmaninov, Victor Kalinnikov, Alexander Grechaninov and Pavel Chesnokov. After the 1917 Revolution, he devoted himself to the study of folksongs. This resulted in many choral works from which the most important are The Village Symphony (1923) and Rural Work in Folksongs (1924).

Wyckoff Heights is an area within the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, straddling the border between Bushwick, Brooklyn, and southwest Ridgewood, Queens. Wyckoff Heights was urbanized starting in the late 19th century, and took its name from the Wyckoff family, who owned the land. The area was home first to many German immigrants, later followed by Italian and more recently Latino and Eastern- European residents. Wyckoff Heights is located largely within ZIP Codes 11237 and 11385. Points of interest include Wyckoff Heights Medical Center and the former Wyckoff Heights Presbyterian Church. History Rowhouses on St. Nicholas Avenue Wyckoff Heights was urbanized starting in the late 19th century, and took its name from the Wyckoff family who owned and farmed much of the land. Development progressed from Brooklyn into Queens as portions of the Wyckoff farm were sold. In 1890, newspapers announced the creation of a new park (now Maria Hernandez Park) to be located in Wyckoff Heights, within the 18th Ward of Brooklyn. In 1892, Queens County property owners established the Wyckoff Heights Improvement Association to lobby for water, sewer, and gas service to the neighborhood, and the next year, the Wyckoff Heights Water Company was formed to supply drinking water to the area. In 1901 residents of the Queens section lobbied the City government to \\"adopt a system of house numbering\\" and erect street signs so that the postal service would begin delivery to the neighborhood. The last of farmland were developed in the 1940s.  ZIP Codes  Initially, mail delivery to the Queens section was provided by the Brooklyn Post Office. The Wyckoff Heights Post Office (ZIP Code 11237) at 86 Wyckoff Avenue was opened in 1951, serving north Bushwick and the Brooklyn portion of Wyckoff Heights. When ZIP Codes were assigned in 1963, all areas whose mail was routed through a Brooklyn post office were given the 112 prefix. The neighboring areas of Glendale and Ridgewood in Queens were given a Brooklyn mailing address, 11227, shared with Bushwick and Wyckoff Heights. In addition, parts of Bushwick and Wyckoff Heights were in ZIP Code 11237. After the 1977 New York City blackout, newspapers around the country published UPI and Associated Press photos of Bushwick residents with stolen items and a police officer beating a suspected looter, and Bushwick became known for riots and looting.Examples: \\"Policeman Discourages a Looting Suspect in the Bushwick Section of Brooklyn\\" (photo).

(November 2, 2007). \\"Is Ridgewood the New East Bushwick?\\". The New York Times. Retrieved August 21, 2009. . Following complaints from residents, Postmaster General William Bolger proposed that the ZIP Codes would be changed if United States Representative Geraldine Ferraro could produce evidence that 70% of residents supported it. After Ferraro's office distributed ballots to residents, 93 percent of the returned ballots voted for the change. The change of the Queens side to ZIP Code 11385 was made effective January 13, 1980. 11237 was reassigned to cover only Bushwick and Wyckoff Heights, and 11227 was eliminated. Land use  Residential  Semi-attached houses on DeKalb Avenue The first buildings constructed in the neighborhood were largely attached wood frame three- and six-family row houses. Around the turn of the century, as urbanization moved northeast towards the borough line and into Queens, developers switched to masonry construction in order to conform to new building and fire codes. Many of these buildings are now part of the Cypress Avenue West Historic District. See also: In the 1940s the last large-scale development in the neighborhood saw the construction of more automobile-oriented attached single-family homes with alleys and garages in the rear.  Points of interest  Wyckoff Heights is home to the Wyckoff Heights Medical Center at Wyckoff Avenue and Stockholm Street (originally the German Hospital of Brooklyn, renamed in 1918), and the former Wyckoff Heights Presbyterian Church at Harman Street and St. Nicholas Avenue (founded in 1895 and rebuilt after a 1928 fire, now the Ridgewood Pentecostal Church).

Research contribution  Global coordination games belong to a subfield of game theory which gained momentum with the article by Morris and Shin (1998). Stephen Morris and Hyun Song Shin considered a stylized currency crises model, in which traders observe the relevant fundamentals with small noise, and show that this leads to the selection of a unique equilibrium. This result is in stark contrast with models of complete information, which feature multiple equilibria. Morris has also made important contributions to the theory of mechanism design. In his work with Dirk Bergemann on robust mechanism design they relaxed common knowledge assumptions which were prevalent in the early mechanism design literature. By formulating the mechanism design problem more precisely, they showed that simple mechanisms arise endogeneously. This provided a theoretical justification for the relatively simple auction design employed in practice, when compared to the complexity of optimal auctions suggested by the early literature.

The school operated under the auspices of the Virginia Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South between 1894 and 1950. The Virginia Department of Historic Resources acknowledged the significance of the site by erecting historical marker number K 174 in 1996. Blackstone College is also designated as a site on the Civil Rights in Education Heritage Trail. The school buildings still stand. Since 1955, the Virginia United Methodist Church has used the former school buildings as a conference center. History The Blackstone Female Institute (BFI) received its charter from the Virginia state legislature on February 15, 1892. The institute's facilities were built on six acres of land donated by the Blackstone Land Company. BFI opened its doors to students in September 1894, and 71 students (29 boarders & 42 day students) enrolled for the first term. After the successful completion of the first academic year, Blackstone Female Institute was recognized by the Randolph- Macon System as a feeder school for Randolph-Macon Woman's College, which had been established in 1891 in Lynchburg. A college component was added to Blackstone Female Institute for the beginning of the 1915‚Äì1916 school year, and the name began to transition to Blackstone College for Girls (BCG), with the \\"college\\" name becoming firmly entrenched in the early 1920s. The 1916 & 1917 editions of the Cannon Ball, the campus yearbook, referred to the school as Blackstone College, and the 1918 Cannon Ball referred to it as Blackstone College for Girls. In 1920 and 1922, two fires devastated the campus: the first one on May 7, 1920, destroyed the main building, and the second one on January 10, 1922, destroyed the Carnegie building that had been built in 1908‚Äì1909. The leaders of the college rebuilt the school on a smaller scale and reopened. In 1943, the college suspended operation for the duration of World War II, and the school buildings were used as apartments by servicemen and their families. Classes resumed in 1945, but dwindling enrollment and the Korean War forced the college to close in 1950. The facility was then purchased by the Virginia Methodist Conference (now Virginia United Methodist Conference) and converted into a retreat and conference center, which was opened in 1955. On February 17, 2016, another major fire destroyed the facility's separate boiler plant building, which had been recently renovated. In March, it was announced that the center would cease operations on May 7, 2016, thus bringing to an end over sixty years of service. Curriculum At the school's inception, its students completed five years of study, the equivalent of the eighth grade plus the four years of high school. Modeled on the Randolph-Macon System of schools, the Blackstone curriculum provided three programs: a basic high school education, preparation for university study, and teacher training. In addition to standard academic courses, the curriculum included three years of Bible studies. Bishop Cannon advocated not only intellectual, but spiritual training as well. Morning chapel, Sunday sermons, and personal counseling were all part of the school week. Faculty and administrators James Cannon, Jr., pastor and later bishop of the Farmville Methodist Episcopal Church, South, was the school's first principal, serving until early 1911. Thomas Rosser Reeves, pastor of Washington Street Church in Petersburg, Virginia, was BFI's principal from 1911 until 1914, when he resigned due to the death of his wife in 1912. James Cannon, Jr., then returned to BFI as president, after spending several years laying the organizational foundations for what later became Lake Junaluska Conference & Retreat Center. Cannon was also a prominent leader in the temperance movement until he was accused of misusing church money after the 1928 election. James Cannon, Jr., was elected bishop in May 1918, and that summer's commencement was his last as president of Blackstone. W. Asbury Christian served as Blackstone's president from 1918 until 1924, when Horwood Prettyman Myers became the school's president. W.B. Gates took over the presidency of the college in 1926, and he remained in that position until 1936, ushering in at least two sororities for the students: Sigma Iota Chi and Kappa Delta Phi. Gates left BCG after a decade and moved to Waynesboro, Virginia, where he purchased Fairfax Hall from the family of its founder, John Noble Maxwell, and oversaw its operation. Joseph Paul Glick then became Blackstone's president from 1936 until the college temporarily suspended operations after the 1942‚Äì1943 academic year due to World War II. Immediately after the war (two weeks after V-J Day), Blackstone College reopened for the 1945‚Äì1946 academic year with John Duncan Riddick as its president. President Riddick oversaw Blackstone's final commencement on June 5, 1950; he resigned later that month, and Everett Cox was appointed as acting president. George P. Adams, a merchant from Blackstone, was a staff member at the school from its founding through its final semester. Adams oversaw the school's buildings and grounds and also served as the Secretary-Treasurer of the Board of Managers. The George P. Adams Memorial Scholarship Trust was established in his honor. Students and alumnae Bea Arthur The first year the school operated, 29 boarders and 42 day students enrolled. At peak enrollment, shortly before the 1920 fire, the student body numbered approximately 500 pupils. Notable alumna of Blackstone include actress Bea Arthur and Violeta Chamorro, former president of Nicaragua.

The main road here is Spital Lane. With new estates being built, businesses include the Co-op, formerly the Spital Hotel and Willbond. Spital also had a park and cemetery. Spital Cemetery  Spital Cemetery Chapel - from westSpital Cemetery Chapel - from south-east Situated three quarters of a mile from the town centre, Spital Cemetery was in 1857 the first public cemetery to be opened in Chesterfield to serve the local communities of Chesterfield and Tapton. The cemetery provides approximately 10.5 acres (4.25 hectares) of burial space. There are two entrances, both off the A632 road at Hady Hill. The lodge at the lower of the two entrances on Hady Hill is a Grade II listed building. The 19th century saw a huge cemetery building programme in response to population growth and an increase in the demands of non-Anglican denominations. The majority were laid out on a garden plan with a cemetery chapel at their heart, and these (like Spital Church and Chapel) were divided to provide Anglican and Nonconformist accommodation. The church and chapel are Grade II listed, but are no longer used for burial services. The chapel has two attractive spires, one in the form of an obelisk and the other a broach spire above the entrance porch. It is in a poor state of repair with deteriorating masonry and water penetration exacerbated by lead theft from the valleys in the roof. In 2012, the cemetery church and chapel were featured in the annual catalogue of buildings at risk published by the conservation charity, \\"SAVE Britain's Heritage\\". Each year, this heritage group shines a spotlight on 100 or so historic buildings in need of repair throughout England and Wales. The building is owned by the council who, together with the Friends of Spital Cemetery, were keen to find a viable alternative use.

Harding is also known for his philanthropy, which includes a ¬£100m donation to the University of Cambridge, the largest ever donation by a British citizen to a university.{{subscription requir Harding has also endowed the Winton Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk in the Statistical Laboratory at Cambridge's Faculty of Mathematics, and established the Harding Center for Risk Literacy at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development. With respect to scientific research, he has established a research programme into the physics of sustainability at Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory. Politically, Harding has served as the joint-treasurer of Britain Stronger in Europe and chairman of the BSIE finance committee. Education and early career David Winton Harding was born in August 1961. He was educated at the University of Cambridge where he attended St. Catharine's College. At Cambridge, Harding studied natural sciences and in 1982 he graduated from his BA with first class honours. Later that year he began a traineeship at Wood Mackenzie, a stockbroker. After two years, he joined the futures brokerage firm, Johnson Matthey & Wallace, as a trader in commodity futures. Investment management In 1985, Harding became a futures trader at Sabre Fund Management, one of the first commodity trading advisors (CTAs) in the United Kingdom. He drew on his scientific background to design trading programs for futures markets.

In 1989, ED & F Man (which later became the Man Group) purchased a 51 percent stake in the firm. When Man bought the whole firm in 1994, Harding became head of Man Quantitative Research. In 1996, he left to set up his own firm. According to Barron's, Harding had left Man after becoming frustrated by lack of focus on research and the bureaucracy of working in a large firm. Winton Group Harding founded Winton, an investment management firm, in 1997. It was named after his middle name and his father's first name. According to Hedge Fund Review magazine, his aim was to demonstrate that a business can be successful based on empirical scientific research, rather than relying on marketing. Harding recruited scientists to the firm to create a strong research environment and to use quantitative, statistical research of market data to inform his trading decisions. The fund had been launched in 1997 with $1.6 million in assets; as of 2013, the fund had returned on average 15% net per year. , Winton had over $30 billion in assets under management.

Harding had previously served as Winton's president and executive chairman. In 2015 he became CEO. Philanthropy Harding has made major donations to educational and research institutions through his Winton Charitable Foundation. The foundation funded a professorship at the Statistical Laboratory of the University of Cambridge, the Winton Professorship of the Public Understanding of Risk, aimed at increasing understanding of the mathematics of risk for individuals and organisations. Harding is also the patron of the Harding Center for Risk Literacy at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, which opened in 2009. Harding's foundation, the David and Claudia Harding Foundation, has pledged ¬£20 million to the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory to establish The Winton Programme for the Physics of Sustainability, an advanced research programme to apply theoretical physics to issues of the sustainability of natural resources. The donation to the Cavendish is the largest since the famous laboratory was established in 1874. Harding is one of the administrators of the Winton Fund for the Physics of Sustainability, which manages the programme's funding. In 2011, Winton began a five-year sponsorship of the Royal Society Prizes for Science Books which was rechristened the Royal Society Winton Prize for Science Books. Harding's foundation has also committed ¬£5m to the Francis Crick Institute in London for cancer research. In 2014, it provided a ¬£5 million donation to the Science Museum in London, the largest single donation in the museum's history, to build a gallery of mathematics. In 2019 Harding donated ¬£100m to Cambridge University, the largest donation by a British citizen to any university. The funds will go towards supporting the Harding Scholars, a distinguished postgraduate scholarship system for more than 100 PhD students, similar to the Rhodes Scholarship and the Gates Cambridge Scholarship. Additional funding will be used to attract students from under-represented groups, allowing Cambridge to recruit the best and brightest students regardless of their social situation.

This stratovolcano is part of the Afar Triangle (Afar Depression), a highly active volcanic region which includes Erta Ale. An eruption on September 26, 2005 created a large fissure in the ground, known as the Dabbahu fissure. 2005 eruption The only eruption of the volcano in recorded history occurred on September 26, 2005. Preceding the eruption, the ground swelled and an earthquake swarm consisting of over 130 events occurred. Earthquakes measured 4.2 on the Richter scale. The eruption began 5 kilometers northeast of the summit. Ash from the eruption darkened the area surrounding the volcano for nearly 3 days. The eruption formed a 500 m long fissure and a wide pumice cone at the fissure's southern end. Ash reached as far as the administrative center of Teru, located southwest of the volcano. Plate tectonics thumb The volcano is located along the Somali Plate. Researchers predict that the land along this region, known as the East African Rift, will eventually break away, creating a new island consisting of eastern Ethiopia and Djibouti with a new sea in between. Using seismic data from 2005, a research study predicted that this new ocean would likely be formed in about one million years. Life Scientists are studying the fissure for extremophiles.

In conjunction with his pilots, he was credited with 21 aerial victories. Early life and service Francis Richard Cubbon was the only surviving son of his parents' marriage. His father was Captain Richard Cubbon, a supply and transport officer of the Indian Army. Cubbon was born in London,Franks et.al. (1997), p.12. but spent most of his youth in Poona, India.Guttman & Dempsey (2009), p.78. The young Cubbon was educated at Alleyn's School and Dulwich College before attending and graduating from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.Aeronautics (1918), p.288. He was posted to the Indian Army as a second lieutenant on 6 September 1911. His first assignment was to the York and Lancaster Regiment in Karachi. He subsequently was appointed to the 72nd Punjabis on the North-western Frontier of India, on 1 December 1912. He was promoted to lieutenant on 6 December 1913, and to captain on 6 September 1915. In November 1915, he was invalided home. Service in Royal Flying Corps Rolls-Royce Eagle powered F.E.2d with nose-wheel. An F.E.2d observer demonstrating the use of the rear- firing Lewis gun, which required him to stand on his seat. Like so many invalided and convalescent land soldiers of the First World War, Cubbon volunteered for flight duty and was accepted as an observer on 25 March 1917. By Bloody April, 1917, he was assigned to 20 Squadron as an observer in Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2s. Frederick Libby, the United States of America's first ace, gave a vivid description of an observer's duties aboard the aircraft that was an incremental development of the pre-1914 Farman Experimental: And Libby did not even mention the hazards of spilling overboard with a propeller chopping along behind the crew. Cubbon scored two victories on 24 April 1917 with Lieutenant R. E. Johnson in F.E.2 number A6392. He then flew with Captain Frederick Thayre for the next six weeks and claimed some nineteen victories. Seventeen of these were over German Albatros D.III single-seated fighters. Upon Captain Albert Ball's death on 7 May, Cubbon became the second ranking ace of the Royal Flying Corps.Greenhous (2002), pp.99‚Äì100. Killed in action On 9 June, two days after scoring their final victory together, Cubbon and Thayre attacked an Albatros two-seater and sent it down in a smoking nose dive. They were then killed in action by a direct hit from anti- aircraft fire from K Flak Battery 60 near Warneton.Shores et.al. (1997), p.360. A German message drop confirmed their deaths to the British authorities, but their graves remain undiscovered.Guttman & Dempsey (2009), p.82. The nineteen victories shared included five Albatros D.IIIs shot down in flames and eleven destroyed, an Albatros reconnaissance two-seater in flames and another destroyed. Another D.III was claimed driven down 'out of control'. Cubbon also added his two victories with Johnson‚Äîa D.III destroyed and one 'out of control'.

Classical Archives. January 25, 2010 The piece is in three movements, and takes approximately thirty minutes to perform: #Allegro, ma non troppo #Improvisation: Andante cantabile #Finale: Andante - Allegro The first movement opens with a brief piano solo, followed by lyrical violin interludes, through which the thematic material is presented. This movement follows typical sonata-allegro form, and although it begins in a melancholy tone, the movement ends jubilantly. The second movement is unique in that it is an Improvisation; that is, the tranquil violin passages give the impression of improvisational material. This movement maintains a beautiful singing tone throughout, and ends meditatively. The third and final movement begins with a slow, methodical piano introduction which then leads into an exuberant Allegro. After a rush of virtuosic passages from both performers, the sonata comes to an explosive end. Notable recordings The earliest recording of the sonata was by Jascha Heifetz with pianist Arpad Sandor for RCA in 1934 (he went on to record it two other times, in 1954 and 1972 in his \\"final recital\\" with pianist Brooks Smith).Review of Heifetz recordings * Jascha Heifetz and Brooks Smith, released by RCA Victor. * Ginette Neveu and Gustav Beck, released by EMI Records. * Gidon Kremer and Oleg Maisenberg, released by Deutsche Grammophon. * Sarah Chang and Wolfgang Sawallisch, released by EMI Records. * Vadim Repin and Nikolai Lugansky, released by Erato Records. * Kyung-Wha Chung and Krystian Zimerman, released by Deutsche Grammophon. * Itzhak Perlman and Emanuel Ax, released by Deutsch√© Grammophon.

It was a single-seat, low-wing braced monoplane with a single engine. The wings were essentially identical to those of the high-wing UTVA-60 apart from the wing roots, which were extended and strengthened so that the chord was greater and the wingspan increased by These wings were of single-spar, all-metal construction, carrying ailerons that linked to the flaps, drooping 15 degrees when the flaps were set to 40 degrees. A single streamlined strut ran from the upper fuselage to mid-wing on either side, with minor struts from them to the wing at about one-quarter span. The conventional all-metal tail surfaces were also from the UTVA-60, but had increased elevator area. The fuselage of the Utva-65 had a steel-tube structure, with metal skinning forward and below and fabric elsewhere. The single-seat pilot's cockpit was high and behind the trailing edge; combined with all-round glazing, this gave a good view and also increased fuselage space. There was a hopper for fertilizer, spray, etc. ahead of the cockpit. Standard spray bars could be fitted under the trailing edge. The undercarriage was of the conventional tailwheel kind, with cantilever main legs angling outwards from the wing root. At launch there were three choices of engine, all Lycoming six- cylinder horizontally-opposed air-cooled types. The GO-480-B1A6 produced 270 hp (200 kW), the geared GO-480-G1A6 290 hp (216 kW), and the IGO-540-B1A 350 hp (260 kW). A later variant of the Utva-65, the Utva-67 (first flown in 1967), was similar, but had the eight-cylinder, 400hp (298 kW) Lycoming IO-720-A1A and a revised fuselage of greater capacity. Its top speed was . Operational history The Utva-65 was used in Yugoslavia by agricultural cooperatives for pesticide application and mosquito control.

In general, the fireman's rule bars lawsuits by police officers, firefighters, and in some jurisdictions all professional rescuers from collecting on damages that occur in the course of their duties even in cases of clear negligence by other parties. Rationale At the most basic, the fireman's rule is based on the notion that public safety officers willingly assume the risks inherent in their duties. Since the very purpose of public safety officers is to confront danger, the public is not liable for injuries incurred while carrying out that function. While the rule is named after the risks and actions by firemen, the relationship between danger and duties is similar in all public safety officers, and other professional rescuers. Criticism The fireman's rule has been heavily criticized for preventing police officers from suing criminals who intentionally lead them on high-speed car chases. In response to one such case, the California State Legislature enacted California Civil Code Section 1714.9 in 1982, which overrides the fireman's rule where the tortious conduct occurred after the defendant knew or should have known of the plaintiff's presence. In Minnesota peace officers are exempted from the fireman's rule by statute.¬ß M.S. 604.06 In certain states, such as Pennsylvania, the courts have not always applied the fireman's rule. In 1995, The Pennsylvania Superior Court ruled that in regards to landowners, firefighters are viewed as \\"licensees,\\" and are therefore owed the same duty of care that any citizen who is permitted to be on the property would receive. In earlier decisions, such as MULL v. KERSTETTER 373 Pa.Super. 228 (1988), in which a volunteer firefighter was injured after falling into an unmarked and unprotected window well, the court ruled that a police officer entering land in his or her official capacity and in response to a call for assistance is generally considered a licensee. Therefore, the landowner is responsible for warning the licensee of any dangerous hidden conditions on the premises.

This steam is then allowed to pass through a narrow bore tube to a face plate. This face plate is then held against a wallpapered wall. The steam passes through the paper, saturates the backing paper and partially dissolves the desiccated wallpaper paste. This then allows the wallpaper to be pulled from, or scraped off the wall. The wallpaper steamer was invented by Peter Ravenscroft Wilkins from Blackwell, Worcestershire, England. Its European patent was filed 19 November 1987. Technology The basic form of a wallpaper steamer is a semi-sealed container, usually made of plastic, that contains a heating element. A quantity of water is added to the container and the water comes into contact with the heating element. Once electrical power is connected to the element, it heats up which then in turn heats the water. The water reaches its boiling point, evaporates and produces steam. As the container is sealed, the steam pressure builds up but is released via a small opening in the container to which is connected a length of pressure pipe. At the end of the pressure pipe is a flat plate about square and 1 cm deep. The plate has a handle on its reverse side. This plate is then held up to the papered wall. The steam being released under pressure from the container travels along the pressure pipe and is released into the forward face of the steam plate. As the plate is held against the wall, a slight seal is maintained which holds steam long enough to force the moisture into the wallpaper, saturating it and rehydrating the wallpaper paste. Once the paste is rehydrated, it starts to lose its adhesive properties, allowing the wallpaper to be either pulled or scraped from the wall. Penetration of steam, especially with vinyl-coated wallpapers, may be accelerated by first perforating the surface of the wallpaper. A variety of spiked roller and spiked wheel hand tools are available for this. During use, the operator's hands are close to the steam source and so protective, heat- and vapour-proof gloves, such as silicone oven gloves, may be helpful. Wallpaper steamers have been more popular in countries, such as the UK or Europe, using 230 V domestic electricity. This provides around 3 kW of steam generating capacity from all sockets around the house.  Other uses  A commercial wallpaper steamer is a conveniently packaged source of steam. This can be used for other purposes too, such as steam-bending wood.
