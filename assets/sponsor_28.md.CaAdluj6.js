During academic year 1926-27, Murdock also conducted research at the Royal Institute‚Äôs Davy-Faraday Laboratory in London, England.  Early Education & Career  Murdock graduated from secondary schooling at Cooperstown High School in 1902. Proceeding to Colgate University, he took his bachelor's degree in 1907. From Colgate he proceeded to the University of Maine at Orono, Maine where he served an assistant instructor in Physics. Murdock was brought to Cornell by Physics Department Chairman and Dean of Graduate Studies, Ernest Merritt, to undertake post-doctoral studies in 1908.The Richfield Mercury (Cooperstown, N.Y.)(Oct. 1, 1908) at 1. Starting as an assistant instructor, he was appointed physics instructor in three weeks time. Murdock completed both his masters‚Äô and doctoral work by 1919, at which time he was made a Cornell assistant professor. He was elevated to full professor in 1932. Professor Murdock is ‚Äúremembered as the personification of the legendary professor, a man whose very presence created an atmosphere of dignity and humanity, of intellect and service.‚ÄùCornell University, The Deanship of University Faculty, List of Deans  Pedagogy & Research  Professor Murdock systematically graded each examination for a student‚Äôs successes, marking each paper three separate times, from three different viewpoints. This allowed both Murdock and the Cornell student to understand exactly what the student had mastered and where the student‚Äôs failings lay. To formal physics course work, Professor Murdock also added lessons in intellectual integrity and human courtesy.Cornell Faculty, Memorial Statement. From the 1928 to 1935, Professor Murdock also led an innovative advanced laboratory for Cornell seniors and graduate students. The subject material included research experiments in areas of emerging or unsettled importance within the field of physics. Each student designed his own experiment (usually to highlight some important physical principle), chose the equipment needed, and fabricated some of the necessary components. In the field of teaching physics, this practical approach became known as ‚ÄúMurdock‚Äôs Lab.‚Äù In this pedagogical setting, Professor Murdock encouraged high performance and instilled enthusiasm for understanding physics. The Lab he created continued in this manner through the academic year 1955-56, twenty years after he had moved to other assignments at Cornell.Memorial Statement. As a researcher, Murdock undertook early studies of photoelectric reactions and soon focused on new developments in X-ray physics and, in particular, by the use of X-rays in deducing the structure of crystals. His enthusiasm focused on the complicated task of computing, from subtle aberrations in X-ray diffraction patterns, the extent of imperfections in crystals and the size and shape of crystals far too small to be seen under the microscope of his day. This is what eventually led him to pioneer the application of computers to Cornell research by working with Caltech‚Äôs Linus Pauling. Such studies comprised the bulk of his extensive research career in the last two decades before retirement.Letter from Linus Pauling to Carleton C. Murdock (Dec. 24, 1941). He also directed his students toward applied sciences. The doctoral thesis of an early graduate student, published in the first issue of the Journal of Applied Physics, is now a classical work in the literature of the field of soil physics.Cornell Faculty, Memorial Statement.  Dean of University Faculty, Cornell University  The Cornell Faculty memorialized Murdock as ‚Äú . . . the personification of the legendary professor, a man whose very presence created an atmosphere of dignity and humanity, of intellect and service. He was first a teacher of physics but no less an inspiring colleague. His own care and rigor induced care and rigor in students and colleagues alike.‚ÄùCornell University Faculty, Carleton C. Murdock, Memorial Statement. Murdock was elected Dean of the University Faculty in 1945. He ‚Äúbrought to the office an unfailing dignity and courtesy, together with strength and wisdom, during a time of difficulty for the University. Following the end of World War II, a surge in enrollments occurred, but so did inflation that eroded the value of Faculty salaries and impaired Faculty morale. The emergence of McCarthyism deeply unsettled the campus.‚Äù Cornell University, The Deanship of University Faculty, List of Deans President Edmund Ezra Day‚Äôs retirement left Cornell University with an absence of leadership.

He served as Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire from 15 January 1903 until 22 July 1908, at the time when the Sultan restored the 1876 Constitution following the Young Turk Revolution. Other than Ottoman Turkish he spoke the Albanian, Arabic, French, Italian, and Greek languages.http://rulers.org/rult.html#turkeyYrd. Do√ß. Dr. Ahmet Emin Yalman - Osmanlƒ± ƒ∞mparatorluƒüu'nda Sadr-ƒ± √Çzamlƒ±k (1876 - 1922) Ankara √úniversitesi, DTCF yayƒ±nlarƒ±, Ankara 1999.  Biography  Mehmed Ferid Pasha was descended from the distinguished wealthy landowning Vlora family that had much influence in Southern Albania ( up to Preveza) and Middle Albania and provided the Ottoman state with senior officials for more than four centuries. His brother Syrja Vlora served as economic advisor to sultan Abdul Hamid II and other family members included the modern Albanian state founder Ismail Qemal bey Vlora. During his youth, Ferid attended the Greek high school Zosimea in Yanina for his education and learned Greek, French and Italian. In the late 1870s Ferid Pasha had been involved with the Society for the Publication of Albanian Writings. After the collapse of the League of Prizren he devoted himself to a career in the Ottoman bureaucracy, becoming at one time a governor of Konya in Anatolia. Ferid Pasha was appointed as Grand Vizier (sadrazam) by Abdul Hamid II in 1903, after the sultan had defeated the League of Peja movement and closed down all Albanian schools in Albania. Amidst a deteriorating geopolitical situation in the Balkans, the sultan's reasons for choosing Ferid Pasha to serve in that role was him being from Vlor√´, an Albanian, his good reputation and holding Albanians in high regard for their service and loyalty to the empire. Expectations of the sultan were that Ferid Pasha would keep Albanians loyal to the empire and mobilize them if a moment of geopolitical crisis called for it. Ferid Pasha offered the sultan his pledge of loyalty saying \\"An Albanian who says besa once cannot in any way break [his] promise and cannot be unfaithful [to it].\\" He brought to the job solid bureaucratic experience and a network of ethnic Albanian connections from a strategic and important area of the empire. As the newly appointed Grand Vizier, Ferid Pasha wanted strong precautions taken against the Young Turk movement to thwart any possible coup d'√©tat attempts on the sultan. In February 1904 Ferid Pasha ordered Necib Efendi, mutasarrif of Elbasan to be transferred from his post, due to charges of bad morals and impotence. In March 1906 a revolt broke out in Erzurum over high taxation and Ferid Pasha refused the demands of the rebels stating that taxation rates were the same throughout the empire without exceptions. Later to appease the rebels Ferid Pasha telegraphed the Muslim clergy of Erzurum that a commission would be sent to investigate and in case of an abuse of power the governor dismissed. Geopolitics and the Albanian question were a focus of Ferid Pasha who expressed concerns during May 1906. For him Italy aimed to turn the \\"Adriatic Sea into an Italian lake\\" expressed in part through its influence in Albania and Rome's connections with Italo-Albanians and some of their societies calling for Albanian autonomy alongside covert and overt Italian officials operating in the region. Warning Ottoman officials to be wary of activities by Italian officials in Albania, he viewed Austria-Hungary as also having its own \\"vexatious ideas and hopes\\" on Albania. During the Young Turk Revolution (1908) the Grand Vizer's office instructed Hilmi Pasha to send an official to investigate the reason for the gathering at Firzovik and disperse the Albanian crowd without force. On 20 July two telegrams by 194 notables from the Firzovik meeting were sent to Ferid Pasha and the Seyhulislam demanding the restoration of the constitution of 1876. The sultan sacked Ferid Pasha on 23 July 1908 and replaced him with Mehmed Said Pasha after he failed to prevent the Young Turk Revolution and keep Albanians loyal to the state of which some were involved in those events. His time as Grand Vizier for five years, six months and eight days would be the third longest during the reign of Abdul Hamid II, representing the sultan's reliance on Muslim Albanians. By 1909, Ferid Pasha had become minister of the interior and in the Ottoman parliament defended government actions in Kosovo against criticisms from Albanian deputies on indiscriminate use of force by the Ottoman army against rebels and civilians caught in the crossfire. Ferid Pasha claimed that the Ottoman state was collecting taxes according to the law and the parliamentary exchanges received applause from deputies on each side highlighting the political polarisation of the time. In 1912 with the Albanian revolt and deteriorating situation in Kosovo, sultan Mehmed V asked Ferid Pasha to become interior minister and member of a new government. His third son Jalaluddin Pasha married Princess Atiyetullah Khanum Efendi, the oldest daughter of Abbas II of Egypt.

It was the standard weapon of the Italian Army during the war, of typical Brandt- system construction, but relatively lightweight, with good range and considered very successful. The weapon used two kinds of ammunition, a heavy high-explosive shell weighing and a lighter shell weighing for long distance fire.  History   Development  The Royal Italian Army during the Great War had employed, alongside the various models of grenade launchers and mortars, the innovative mortar ML 3 inch Stokes. In the early thirties the Kingdom of Italy bought the Brandt 81 mm Mle 1927 directly in France, derived from the Stokes, to equip the troops sent to Ethiopia. Trials concluded that the Brandt was so great a weapon that, in addition to having a significant commercial success, in a few years was built under license or copied in most of the major countries of the world. Even in Italy in fact the company Costruzioni Elettro-Meccaniche di Saronno, in addition to producing the Brandt license, created an improved version, the Mortaio da 81 Mod. 35, which proved to be the best of the mortars of the Royal Italian Army. At the end of the thirties the CEMSA privately developed an enhanced version of Mod. 35, proposed to the Italian armed forces and on the foreign market, the CEMSA 81 mm L.P. (Lunga Portata, or \\"long-range\\"). This piece, which faithfully modeled on the setting of the Mod. 35, differed especially for the presence of a cooling system of the barrel.  Use  Italy entered World War II, June 10, 1940, resulting in Service in the Royal Italian Army 2177 pieces Mod. 35. These were assigned to 212 mortars companies [2], each on three platoons with two weapons each. According to the Pariani order, in each infantry division there must be a battalion of mortars with two mortars companies of 81; another company was in an organic to each of the two regiments of infantry. After the armistice of Cassibile the Mod. 35 was also used by the National Republican Army of the Italian Social Republic and remained in service with the Italian Army until the sixties. During the Winter War, as part of the Italian military aid to Finland (also including carbines Carcano Mod. 38) were ordained a hundred Mod. 35, called KRH 81/36-I; the \\"KRH\\" acronym is short for kranaatinheitin (\\"mortar\\") in Finnish; the letters \\"I\\" stands for italialainen (\\"Italian\\") and served to distinguish the piece of CEMSA from other derivatives French Brandt and his Polish and Hungarian products, all purchased from the Scandinavian country. During the Continuation War, the same Italian mortars ended up in the hands of the Wehrmacht, and was renamed 8.1 cm GrW 276 (i). They were joined by 200 mortars delivered in April 1944 by CEMSA to the Germans who occupied northern Italy.

In 1969 he produced the film Stadig oor die klippe (Slowly across the rocks), while playing the lead role of Boetie Flenters (a bungling private eye who ‚Äì √† la the Pink Panther ‚Äì somehow still managed to get the bad guys). However, Al always thought that Donker Afrika (1957) (Dark Afrika) was his best film. He appeared in over twenty films, in a movie career that spanned more than 60 years. His last appearance was in the 2004 movie, Oh Schuks... I'm Gatvol (Oh Shucks, I'm fed up), which was directed by Leon Schuster.  Music  In 1968 Al had a runaway success with his rendition of Hasie, a song composed by Nico Carstens and Anton de Waal. After this, the man with the rolling eyes, funny hat and oversized glasses completed 11 music albums. In 1996 he issued his second-last album (or his last with new material), called Ek lewe nog (I‚Äôm still alive). Four years later, in 2000, his \\"greatest hits\\" album appeared, called Pieringoog Potpourri ‚Äì Al Debbo s√™ dankie (Saucer Eye Potpourri ‚Äì Al Debbo says Thank You). Some of Debbo's greatest hits were: * Baas Jack (Boss Jack ‚Äì a variation on an international hit in English entitled Master Jack, which was composed for the South African folk rock ensemble Four Jacks and a Jill) * Bloubergstrand (Blue mountain beach ‚Äì a well known beach just north of Cape Town) * Boerekos (Afrikaner Food) * Bokkie (Lit.

A junior branch of the family is descended from one of his younger sons and holds the title of Count, which was granted by Pope Pius X in 1904. Claes Lagergren owned Tyres√∂ Palace and rebuilt the castle inspired by original drawings from the 17th century; in his will he left the palace to the Nordic Museum. History Claes Eric Philip Frans Joseph Leo Lagergren (1853‚Äì1930) converted to Catholicism in 1880 and became a papal chamberlain in 1884, serving under Pope Leo XIII, Pope Pius X, Pope Benedict XV, and Pope Pius XI. He was conferred the hereditary title of Marquess of Lagergren by Pope Leo XIII in 1889. The title is inherited according to extended agnatic primogeniture, meaning that title is held by both the senior male line descendant and the next in line (typically his eldest son) simultaneously. Claes Lagergren married Caroline Alice Maria Beatrice Claudia Russell (1854‚Äì1919), on 6 May 1891 in Rome, and had three sons: *Claes Leo Alexander Carl Erik Johan Axel Claesson Lagergren (1892‚Äì1961), Marquis (from 1892), papal chamberlain *Leo Johan Arthur Louis Josef Gustaf Howland Claesson Lagergren (1898‚Äì1975), Count (from 1904), papal chamberlain *Leo Carl Gustaf Paul Johan Dionysius Claesson Lagergren (1899‚Äì1931), Count (from 1904), Lieutenant Lagergren Coat of the Arms In 1904, the younger sons Johan and Carl were both conferred the hereditary title of Count of Lagergren by Pope Pius X. The two comital titles are inherited according to normal agnatic primogeniture, meaning that the titles are held by the senior male line descendant of each of them. The head of the family by male primogeniture is the only person entitled to the title (unless the brief granting the title states otherwise). Consequently, the head of the family will bear the title before his surname, without a mention of his first name. E.g. Count Lagergren. All other cadets, as long as they fulfil the two requirements defined by the 1904 Papal brief, that is 1) being descended from the first bearer of the title, through an uninterrupted succession of ancestors legitimately wed under Catholic rules. 2) and having never left the Catholic religion, are entitled to the mention ‚Äúnoble of the Counts Lagergren‚Äù after their surname are therefore entitled to be introduced by mentioning their ancestor's title, immediately followed by their first name and then their surname, to differentiate them from the head of the family as per the rules of Consulta Araldica The titles were legally recognized by Italy 1929‚Äì1948, and remain legally recognized by the Holy See. In Sweden, the family is considered part of the unintroduced nobility, being one of very few families to hold a rank above Count and the only Swedish-origined family ever to hold the title of Marquis. For many decades, the Lagergren family and the likewise unintroduced (Napoleonic) D'Otrante ducal family were the only non-royal families in Sweden to hold a rank above Count. Claes Lagergren was part of the circle around King Oscar II of Sweden, and had good connections to Catholic conservative elite circles in Rome. His wife's inheritance made it possible for him to buy Tyres√∂ Palace in 1892, which he rebuilt inspired by original drawings from the 17th century in a national romantic style. In 1922, three years after the death of his first wife, he married Mary Moore Ogden (1856‚Äì1933), who was also a wealthy American heiress and whose funds made it possible for him to rebuild the castle. In accordance with his last will and testament, his widow left the estate to the Nordic Museum.http://www.nordicacademicpress.com/o.o.i.s?id=52&vid;=543 The ancestors of Claes Lagergren in the 18th and 19th centuries were parish priests, landowners, and surveyors.Svenskt biografiskt lexikon Vol 22√ñrnbergs Svenska √Ñttartal Vol 5  Marquesses of Lagergren *Claes Eric Philip Frans Joseph Leo Lagergren (1853‚Äì1930), Marquis 1889‚Äì1930 *Claes Leo Alexander Carl Erik Johan Axel Claesson Lagergren (1892‚Äì1961), Marquis 1892‚Äì1961 *Claes Lagergren (1940‚Äì2016\\"Claes Lagergren,\\" Svenska Dagbladet, 16 October 2016), Marquis 1940‚Äì2016 *Claes Lagergren (born 1960), Marquis since 1961 *Claes Lagergren (born 1992), Marquis since 2016 Counts of Lagergren * Johan Lagergren (1898‚Äì1975), elevated to the hereditary rank of Count in 1904. * Gustaf-Erik Lagergren (1932‚Äì2000), who became Count Lagergren from 1975. * Carl-Gustaf Lagergren (1960-2013).

She is Professor Emeritus (1972 to 1995) at the Tyler School of Art. Her career as an artist spans the \\"whole history of modern fiber art.\\" Her work is in the Renwick Gallery, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Museum of Art and Design.Her papers (2.6 linear feet, dating from 1960 to 2009) are at the Archives of American Art. Early life and education Akers was born on February 7, 1933, in Santiago de Compostela, Spain. She was raised in Cuba, her mother was a trained seamstress, and later she and her husband had a small import business in Havana, Cuba. Akers' exposure to business practices through her family helped her later in life to run her own small art business. She has one brother who later became an accountant in Chicago. Akers graduated from the University of Havana with a degree in Pharmacy. She had wanted to have a practical job, especially because her parents had helped her get through school. However, later, Akers found she was bored with pharmacy work. In Havana, she met a group of artists who called themselves Los Once (The Eleven) who encouraged her to make art. Akers started taking art classes because of the suggestion of Los Once and she went to study in Chicago in 1957. She studied at the Art Institute of Chicago, even though at first her English wasn't as strong as she wished. At the Institute she was introduced to weaving. Later she studied at Cranbrook Academy of Art where she finished in 1963. She was a weaver-in- residence at Penland School of Crafts. In 1965, she went to a small town, Chota, in northern Peru with a government program as a weaving advisor. She lives in Guerneville, California.  Artwork and career  Her weavings consist of zigzags, checkerboard patterns, and simple geometric shapes. Akers‚Äôs work has been influenced and informed by pre-Columbian textiles and paintings by women of the Mbuti (Ituri Forest in the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Pre-Columbian work, especially appealed to Akers because she saw math and geometry in it. Akers is also very attached to using a loom for the same reasons, because the loom is very mathematical. Journeying from one point to another has been a physical and transformative reality in her life, increasing her self-confidence and expanding her vision of the world. These geographical voyages have enabled her to experience the broad horizons and quiet strength of country living, the power of nature, and the palpitating rhythm of cities. While travel has enlarged her perspective, her work expresses the sense of journey itself, rather than alluding to a specific site or sense of place. Akers works in series, with each piece informing the next.

She is best known for her long association with the Self-Employed Women's Association (SEWA), India, and for her writings on issues of women in the informal economy. In 1990, she was awarded a Padma Shri from the Government of India for her contributions in the field of social work. In April 2012, she became Chancellor of Gandhigram Rural Institute, a Deemed University in Tamil Nadu, India.  Early life, family and education  Renana Jhabvala was born in Delhi to the Booker Prize winning novelist and screenwriter, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, and well-known architect Cyrus S. H. Jhabvala. Her grandparents were active in public life during the early to mid part of the twentieth century. Her grandfather, Shavaksha Jhabvala, was active in the early Indian trade union movement, and her grandmother, Mehraben Jhabvala, in the emerging women's movement. In February 2012 talk given at India International Centre (Delhi), Renana spoke about the work of Mehraben, who was a dedicated organiser and advocate of women and the President of the All-India Women's Conference from 1965‚Äì68. Jhabvala was raised and schooled in Delhi and graduated from Hindu College, University of Delhi, in 1972 with a distinction in BSc Maths. She attended Harvard University to pursue an additional degree in BA Maths. She then went on to the Yale University to pursue post-graduate studies in Economics.  Career and honours  After completing her studies, Jhabvala joined SEWA in Ahmedabad, in 1977 as an organiser. She worked first with the women workers stitching quilts in the Muslim area of Ahmedabad where she was instrumental in forming the first Cooperative in SEWA. Her main work was organising women into SEWA as a trade union. In 1981, she was elected Secretary of SEWA under the leadership of Ela Bhatt and organised beedi workers, agricultural workers, garment workers, street vendors and many others to bargain for higher income, better working conditions, space to work and social security. She was active in fostering the growth of SEWA across India, taking the experiences of the organisation to States like Madhya Pradesh and Bihar and most recently to Uttarakhand and West Bengal. Jhabvala was instrumental in forming SEWA Bharat, a National Federation of SEWAs now in nine States of India.

Originally designed in the Carpenter Gothic style, the house was expanded and transformed into the more fashionable Queen Anne style around 1891. Also in 1891, Graf received one of the area's earliest federal land patents for his homestead. Graf worked as a farmer and machinist, and as a homebuilder in Portland and Corbett.

Most of the sprouts lie within Albany County, with the northern ones in Saratoga County, and the sprouts enter the Hudson at the boundary with Rensselaer County. The islands formed by the sprouts are, from north to south-Peebles Island, Polrump Island, Bock Island, Goat Island, Second Island, Van Schaick Island, Simmons Island. and formerly Green Island. The sprout separating Green Island from the rest of Albany County was filled in with the creation of Interstate 787 and NY Route 787. History Henry Hudson's crew may have reached as far as the sprouts in 1609 when Hudson sent a small boat with his first mate and four crew members from Half Moon up the Hudson River to see if the river was indeed the Northwest Passage. The islands and sprouts (spuyten in Dutch) along with land along the northern shore of the northern sprouts was part of a tract of land deeded to Philip Pieterse Schuyler and Gozen Gerritse Van Schaick in 1665. The Native Americans called the area Nach-te-Nack, and by the Dutch settlers Halve-Maen (translated as Halfmoon in English). In 1674 Schuyler gave up his rights to the land to Van Schaick, and in 1687 Van Schaick's son Anthony Van Schaick was confirmed sole owner through patent title by Governor Thomas Dongan. Portions of the sprouts were very shallow, or less, and allowed for easy fording of the river. Waterford received its name from the ford connecting the village to Peebles Island, a name which became popular through use by soldiers in the US Revolutionary War. The fords connecting the islands were used by the local Native Americans, the Mohicans and by the Dutch and English at Fort Orange and Albany en route to Montreal and Canada, being used by soldiers in the French and Indian Wars. During the American Revolutionary War the islands were the site of military fortifications protecting the fords and river road leading to Albany from invasion forces coming from Canada. Numerous fortifications were constructed on Peebles and Van Schaick Island, with the Van Schaick House being the military headquarters. The Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad (incorporated 1832) crossed onto Green Island from Troy over the Hudson River and then traveled north over three of the sprouts, crossing into Saratoga County. In 1828 the King's Power Canal was constructed with two dams thrown across the Fourth Branch, between Waterford and Bock Island and then between Bock and Peebles. The state dam between Cohoes and Waterford, located where the sprouts exit from the main channel of the Mohawk River, was rebuilt east (downstream) of the old dam in 1868. Both the original and the new dam were for the original path of the Champlain Canal, allowing the canal boats to cross the Mohawk River to the canal channel on the other side in place of using an aqueduct bridge over the river. The original dam was too low and boats often went over the edge, the newer dam being taller was to cut down on that problem. Sprouts Fourth, or North, Branch of the Mohawk River surrounding Bock Island Throughout the years the individual sprouts have been given different names. From north to south the sprouts are the-Fourth Branch, dividing Peebles Island from the mainland of Saratoga County; the Third Branch, separating Peebles from Van Schaick; the First Branch separating Van Schaick and Green islands from the mainland of Albany County; and the Second Branch, separating Van Schaick from Green Island. The Fourth Branch is also known as the North Sprout; and the Third Branch as the Middle Branch, which is the location of a rapid called Buttermilk Falls. The Middle Branch or sprout was also referred to as the White Sprout by the New York State Assembly in 1833. The name Fourth Branch is still used in reference to the hydroelectric power plant located in the town of Waterford. The center of the Third Branch is the political boundary between Saratoga and Albany counties while the Second Branch is the boundary between the city of Cohoes and the town/village of Green Island. Islands *Green Island-Prior to being stripped of its status as an island, Green Island was the largest of the islands formed by the sprouts. Green Island was separated from Watervliet, Colonie and Cohoes mainlands by the First Branch and from Van Schaick Island by the Second Branch, with the Hudson River separating the island from Troy. The island is a part of the village and town of the same name. *Van Schaick Island-A large and heavily populated island with the historic Van Schaick House, a country club, the historic Matton Shipyard, marinas, an elementary school. The island is separated from the mainland of Cohoes and Simmons Island by the First Branch, from Peebles Island by the Third Branch, Green Island by the Second Branch, and from Troy by the Hudson River. Politically a part of the city of Cohoes. *Simmons Island-a small island in the middle of the First Branch with Van Schaick to the east and the mainland of Cohoes to the west. Politically a part of the city of Cohoes. *Peebles Island-At the largest of the islands formed by the sprouts that are in the town of Waterford and Saratoga County. It is part of the Peebles Island State Park and home to the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation. *Second Island-Second largest, after Peebles, of the islands that are in Waterford, and once was called King's Island. The island is the home to a Boy Scouts of America camp, Camp Kavanaugh. *Goat Island-situated in the middle of the Fourth Branch and is owned by the state of New York. *Bock Island-the site of two dams, one on each side connecting it to the Saratoga County mainland and to Peebles Island. Situated in the middle of the Fourth Branch and owned by Mohawk Paper. The island is in size. *Polrump Island-situated in the middle of the Fourth Branch and is owned by the state of New York. Recreation Peebles Island is part of the Peebles Island State Park, an undeveloped park with recreational hiking paths and remnants of historical battleworks thrown up during the US Revolutionary War. The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation headquarters is located on the island. There is a public fishing site on the northern end of Simmons Island, and Peebles Island has shoreline fishing spots and areas where the river can be safely waded in. All fishing in the sprouts is catch and release due to the presence of PCB. A former railroad bridge over the Second Branch, variously referred to as the Black, Delaware, or Cohoes-Green Island bridge was renovated as part of a bike/hike trail connecting the cities and villages of Watervliet, Green Island, Cohoes, and Waterford. A visitor's center with public docks are on the northern shore of the Fourth Branch in the village of Waterford. There are designated swimming areas and there are individuals who enjoy river surfing.

The episode was written by Joe Weisberg and directed by Fred Toye. Tom works up a plan to extract his harnessed son Ben along with the other captive children from the local hospital. Hal comes up with an alternative plan, volunteering to wear Rick's harness and pretend to be a prisoner to rescue Ben.  Plot  Hal and Margaret return to the High School after scouting the area near the hospital where the drugs they need are kept. They hand the drugs over to Anne for the operations. Anne speaks to Tom about the risks of the procedure, letting him know that there is a chance Ben could die. Tom and Hal go and see Weaver to give him a brief on the situation. Tom tells him that Ben's group is still at the hospital. Tom shows his plan to Weaver on a map. Anne continues to give water to the Skitter. Dr. Harris doesn't agree that it deserves to be hydrated. While getting food, Margaret meets Sarah, a pregnant civilian. Later, Scott tells Tom that he can try and pick up a Skitter transmission on his radio as the Skitters communicate using radio waves, as an early warning system that Skitters are nearby. However, just one Skitter in the hospital will not be transmitting. Weaver hears a record that Scott is playing and it clearly brings up a distasteful memory. He finds it and removes it. The song on the record is \\"Many Rivers to Cross\\" by Jimmy Cliff. Tom and Hal practice shooting targets with crossbows as a crossbow can kill a Skitter silently. Margaret offers her assistance and helps Hal with his aim. She tells Tom that she knows the layout of the hospital where Ben is kept. Dr. Harris prepares to inject the Skitter with a lethal serum. He fails to do so and the Skitter attacks him. Anne runs to help and gets the Skitter off him but Harris dies immediately. After this, Weaver tells his soldiers that the Skitter needs to die. Anne asks for more time to study it and Weaver gives her 24 hours. Hal speaks to Rick who sits quietly on a bench outside. Hal asks him about the \\"harness\\" and the Skitters. Rick tells Hal that if they go and find Ben, they will be killed. Hal then comes up with a new plan for rescuing Ben, wearing a \\"harness\\" himself in order to avoid detection. Tom protests against this idea, but Hal convinces him. The pair goes to see Anne, who tells them of the \\"pressure point\\" that Dr. Harris found earlier when Mike knocked the Skitter out: the Skitters have no bone separating the soft palate of their upper mouth from the brain, making it a weak spot. She tests this theory by shoving her scalpel in its mouth, driving it hard enough that she penetrates the soft tissue into the brain and kills it. Tom speaks to Anne about what happened and she tells him it wasn't hard. She breaks down and tells Tom that she has no picture of her family. Later that night, Tom, Hal, Dai, Anthony and Margaret arrive at the hospital. The group hides behind a car as Hal, \\"harnessed\\", enters the hospital. He finds a group of kids in a group following a Skitter and he joins them, blending in. The kids lie down on the floor to sleep. The Skitter perches itself over them, sheltering the children under its legs like a mother hen, while petting their hair almost as if they are pets. Tom and Margaret enter the hospital in order to save Hal who was now waiting for the right time to attack. He slowly removes the scalpel from his pocket and attacks, but the Skitter fights back, as do the kids. Tom and Margaret find him but cannot shoot as they might miss and hit Hal or one of the kids. Margaret manages to shoot the Skitter with an arrow which distracts it, allowing Hal to successfully stab the Skitter in its mouth and kill it. The group then escapes, bringing the kids with them. Anne begins to operate on the six kids. She removes most of the \\"harnesses\\" successfully from five, but one child dies. While waiting for news on Ben, Hal sits in the school hallway, when he is visited by Margaret. She tells him that she had cancer when she was younger. Tom later comes to see Hal, telling him how proud of him he is. Weaver plays the record he confiscated from Scott, crying slightly. Anne enters the operating room to find Tom and his sons. Tom thanks Anne for saving Ben‚Äôs life. Ben awakes later, apparently recognizing his father.  Production   Development  Silent Kill was written by Joe Weisberg and directed by Fred Toye. Toye previously directed the fourth episode, Grace. This is the first episode that Joe Weisberg wrote. He later writes the ninth episode, Mutiny. The scene where Hal enters the hospital with Rick's harness was shot in an abandoned hospital in Toronto. During the scene where the actors had to react to the mech walking by, a crewmember walked through the space with a large pole with a light on it. This gave the actors the basic size and speed to track to. A scene was later shot without the crew member. Whenever the mech was meant to contact the shrubbery, the effects crew attached fishing lines to the bushes, which were shaken in sync with when the interaction was meant to happen.  Reception   Ratings  In its original American broadcast, \\"Silent Kill\\" was seen by an estimated 3.90 million household viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. The episode received a 1.4 rating among viewers between ages 18 and 49.  Reviews  Ryan McGee from The A.V. Club gave the episode a B-, stating: \\"...since this show will certainly have time to improve itself now that there‚Äôs definitely a second season, let‚Äôs hope the show figures out how to excise what currently holds the show back from being more than simple summer entertainment.\\" Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic said: \\"We're never far removed from the heart of the series. Tom isn't running around screaming, shooting, panicking. He's just a loving father, never failing to be there for his kids, who has been thrust into the role of quasi action hero. He also seems to have come a long way from the premiere, when he said his wife always said the right thing to their sons. Tom did a pretty solid job here with Hal, didn't he?\\"  References  Category:2011 American television episodes Category:Falling Skies (season 1) episodes ","title":"Silent Kill"},{"id":"32453767","text":"The Donald and Ruth McGraw House, located in the Dunthorpe neighborhood of Multnomah County, Oregon, just outside the Portland municipal boundary, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

January 26, 1997) was a leading Slovak literary theorist and comparativist of Ukrainian origin. He belonged to the Slovak School of Comparative Literature. He worked in the tradition of the Czech and Slovak schools of comparative literature. He is renowned for developing the notions of world literature and interliterary processes. Work In his work Theory of Literary Comparatistics (1984), he defines \\"literary process\\" as the \\"inner laws of development of literature.\\" He elaborates upon the goal of literary studies, and comparative literature in particular, by noting: \\"To comprehend the literary phenomenon means not merely to describe its constituents, or to point out their mutual affinity and interdependence within the work of literature, but to reveal the multifarious affinities of the literary phenomenon and the individual procedures with the social, cultural, artistic and literary background in the widest sense of the word\\" (p. 11). He notes that the ultimate goal of literary research was not \\"merely reconstruction of the laws of national literature as an organic literary-historical unit, but also the comprehension of the broader laws of the literary process, leading in the final result to the comprehension of the laws governing world literature\\" (p. 12). In the same book, ƒéuri≈°in claimed that he was developing the native Slovak tradition of criticism and developing ideas of theorists like Alexander Veselovsky and Viktor Zhirmunsky.

He represented the United States in the 1976 Summer Olympics in the 10,000 meters. As a high schooler, he set a Minnesota state record for the mile run which lasted 39 years. At the University of Minnesota, he won the 1971 national championship in the six-mile run, and won numerous conference championships in various disciplines. Following his 1976 Summer Olympics appearance, Bjorklund became a marathon runner, and set a national age group record in 1980. Early life and college career Born in Duluth, Minnesota, on April 22, 1951, Bjorklund spent his early years in Twig, where he lived on a farm. In his high school years, he took up running; Bjorklund ran a mile in 4:19 his freshman year at Proctor High School.Benyo and Henderson, pp. 37‚Äì38. At the 1969 Minnesota State Meets, he broke the state high school mile record with a time of 4:05.1. The Minnesota State High School League continues to consider Bjorklund's time a state record. Also in 1969, he won the Amateur Athletic Union 15,000 m title. That year, Bjorklund began attending the University of Minnesota, where he began competing in longer races. At Minnesota, he participated in track and field (indoor and outdoor) and cross country running. During his time at college, he was named an All-American five times: twice each in outdoor track and field and cross country, and once in indoor track and field. In 1970, he won the mile run at the Big Ten Conference championships. The next year, at the National Collegiate Athletic Association Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship, he claimed a victory in the six- mile run, setting a meet record with a time of 27:43.1. While at Minnesota, Bjorklund won Big Ten championships in other disciplines; he won numerous other conference titles, including three in two and three-mile runs. From 1969 to 1971, Bjorklund had a streak of three consecutive Big Ten cross country championships. He also won the Big Ten five-mile championship twice and the six-mile title in 1971, the same year as his national championship win in that distance. Bjorklund broke Big Ten records in seven categories, including the indoor and outdoor three-mile and outdoor mile.Christensen, p. 183. In 1971, he ran in the Pan American Games. Although he had been considered a strong contender to qualify for the United States' track and field team at the 1972 Summer Olympics, Bjorklund was unable to go to the U.S. Olympic Trials because of an injured left foot, and therefore missed the Games. He was forced to undergo surgery, and according to the University of Minnesota, \\"doctors told him that he may never run again.\\" Although Bjorklund missed the 1973 college season, he returned to competition for Minnesota in 1974. Post-college career Bjorklund competed in his second Pan American Games in 1975. In the 10,000 m run, he finished just outside the medal places, in fourth. In June 1976, Bjorklund ran in the 10,000 m race at the U.S. Olympic Trials, seeking a place at the 1976 Summer Olympics. The race was held at Eugene, Oregon's Hayward Field over almost 25 laps; the top three finishers would earn a spot on the U.S. Olympic team. In the first half of the race, the leading contenders‚ÄîBjorklund, Craig Virgin, Bill Rodgers, and Frank Shorter‚Äîstayed grouped together. During lap 14, Bjorklund lost his left shoe when another runner made contact with his foot. Despite only wearing one shoe, Bjorklund continued running, but with two laps remaining Rodgers had built a 30 m lead on him. While Shorter and Virgin battled for the win, Bjorklund made up his deficit to Rodgers and overtook him, beating him to the finish line by less than a second. At the Olympics, Bjorklund reached the 10,000 m final, becoming the lone U.S. qualifier for the event. He did not win a medal in the final, ending in 13th place. By 1977, Bjorklund had started running in marathons, and the next year announced that he would focus on them. He cited a lack of support from track promoters and governing bodies and said, \\"I got more notice running in my first two marathons than I did in my total track career.\\" In his third career marathon appearance, Bjorklund had a course-record time of 2:13:46.4 at the Maryland Marathon. Bjorklund posted a fifth-place finish in the 1977 New York City Marathon, and was the early leader in 1978 before fading in the final eight miles. Bjorklund was the winner of 10 \\"major road races\\" in 1978, and was considered a main competitor for Rodgers, the winner of those New York City Marathons.Sandrock, p. 114. At the 1979 Boston Marathon, he again finished in fifth. Due to the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott by the U.S., Bjorklund was unable to run the marathon in the Games that year. After declining to run in the Boston Marathon, he decided against taking part in the U.S. Olympic Trials. However, he did run the fastest marathon of his career at that year's Grandma's Marathon, posting a time of 2:10.20. That time, the third-quickest of the year in the U.S., set a national record for his age. By 1981, Bjorklund was the owner of a series of five stores selling running goods in the Minneapolis ‚Äì Saint Paul region. At the 1984 U.S. Olympic Trials in the marathon, Bjorklund pulled out with about eight miles left. He also attempted to make the 10,000 m team, but was passed for the final qualifying spot in the final 300 m. As of 2015, Bjorklund resides in Fort Collins, Colorado. Honors Bjorklund was inducted into the Road Runners Club of America's Hall of Fame in 1988. He is also in the Hall of Fame of his high school, and in 1992 the University of Minnesota inducted him into its M Club Hall of Fame. In 2012, the Colorado Running Hall of Fame honored Bjorklund. The Grandma's Marathon in Duluth named a side event after him; the Garry Bjorklund Half Marathon has been held since 1991.

Misunderstood, largely forgotten and often considered a marginal figure in Serbian poetry, criticized for his cryptic style littered with incomprehensible words and obscure metaphors, Koder was nevertheless a unique phenomenon in the 19th century Serbian literature, sometimes cited as the first Serbian modernist.Na≈° prvi modernista, ≈Ω. Miliƒáeviƒá, Knji≈æevne hronike II, Beograd 1939. Biography ƒêorƒëe Markoviƒá Koder was, by his own account, born in 1806 in the village of Viziƒá or Bingula, in Fru≈°ka gora, present-day Serbia. Soon after that his family moved to Sremska Mitrovica, where his father worked as a merchant and ran a general store. After finishing German elementary school in Mitrovica, Koder was sent to Szeged, Hungary, where he finished Piarist high school. In 1831 he graduated from the two-year Protestant law school, where he found a job as a fencing instructor with the army. In 1837 Koder obtained a passport with the aim of going to Istanbul, via Bucharest and Athens. However, as he didn't manage to raise the money for the journey, he was compelled to move to Trieste, where his brother Jovan worked as an accountant for an American company.Pismo Kodera Mariji Milutinoviƒá, 1837, Matica Srpska, Novi Sad, sign. 21718 He lived in a poor suburb of Trieste, dedicating his time to writing and trying to procure a job. He corresponded with his relative Marija Popoviƒá- Punktatorka, the soon-to-be wife of Sima Milutinoviƒá Sarajlija. As he failed in the latter, in 1838 he moved back to Szeged and then Budapest, where he attended university lectures in various disciplines, such as medicine, astronomy and aesthetics. At the same time he tried to learn and perfect multiple languages ‚Äì English, French, Greek and Sanskrit. In 1839 Koder suddenly decided to move to Kragujevac, Serbia, where he became a fencing and gymnastics instructor for Mihailo and Milan, the sons of prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá. He also worked as an interpreter for the prince. When Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá abdicated from power, in June 1839, Koder moved to Belgrade, where he worked at odd jobs until he managed to open a fencing school in 1844. The funding for the school was provided by Jovan Niniƒá, a wealthy Serbian patriot from Belgrade.Zagrebaƒçki list \\"Danica\\", broj 16, 20. april 1844, rubrika \\"Vesti iz Beograda\\" One year later Koder returned to Szeged, then to Timi»ôoara, then back to Belgrade, where he found a house in the poor suburb of Palilula and became friends with Jakov Ignjatoviƒá, a famous Serbian novelist and prose writer, and writer Milan Saviƒá. Both Saviƒá and Ignjatoviƒá left vivid reminiscences of him in their respective memoirs. In 1852, Serbian magazine Svetovid, from Timi»ôoara, published two Koder's poems: Grlica (Turtle Dove) and Leptir (Butterfly).ƒåasopis \\"Svetovid\\", broj 4, 12. jul 1852, Leptir ƒê. M.

Markoviƒáa da u Beogradu 1858. godine proƒçita i objavi spev Romoranka, Knji≈æevne novine, LIII, 2000, No. 1007-1008 In a Letter to his relative Marija Popoviƒá-Milutinoviƒá (better known as Punktatorka) we read that he is about to finish Romoranka, about to write Tolkovka as an addition to it, and that he was about to write another book called Milogorka i Devesilje. Next month he got a permanent job as a fighting instructor in the Artillery School in Belgrade, and in 1859 he applied for Serbian citizenship. He continued his work on Romoranka, and in 1860 published an advertisement calling for subscribers.Srpske novine, broj XXVII 4, 5. januar 1860 When a series of uprisings against the Ottoman government broke out in Montenegro and Herzegovina in 1861, Serbian government sent ƒêorƒëe Markoviƒá Koder as an emissary and a negotiator between warring sides, carrying letters on the behalf of the European Commission.Graƒëa za istoriju veze Crne Gore i Hercegovine od 1852, Zapisi, Knjiga XII, str. 120-121 Markoviƒá's role in the negotiations remains unclear and the historical data are scarce. In 1861. Koder moved to Novi Sad, where he managed to publish a couple of his poems in the magazines Danica and Javor, the latter edited by Jovan Jovanoviƒá Zmaj.List \\"Javor\\", broj 22, 10. avgust 1862, Novi Sad His main poem, Romoranka, which integrated and extended many of the motives exhibited in his previous poems, was finally published in September 1862. Milka Grgurova, an actress from Novi Sad, left a vivid account of her visit to Koder's rented room, shown in by the poet's landlady as he was not at home at the time of the visit. Her account gives us an interesting insight into his lifestyle. 500px \\"When we entered the room‚Ä¶ The things that we saw! First we heard a piglet, that came right to us. It probably thought that its master, Koder, had come home. White rabbits, chicken, ducklings and whatnot! And all that crowd greeted us with much noise and affection. All that four-legged and feathery two-legged company lived in perfect harmony. What's more, the whole menagerie lived with Koder, in a single room furnished in a very original way. In one corner there was a bed, with straw mat covered by a thick blanket. By the window there was a simple merchant's chest, which he used as a writing desk, on top of which there was a whole mess of papers, books, goose quilts and an earthen inkstand. In the mess I could discern a book titled Romoranka, which he later gave me as a gift, as well as some poems by Branko Radiƒçeviƒá\\" .\\"ƒêorƒëe Markoviƒá Koder\\", Stani≈°a Vojinoviƒá, Narodna knjiga, Beograd, 2005, str. 94 After publishing Romoranka, Markoviƒá left Novi Sad for Istanbul, where he spent a couple of years working as an interpreter for various embassies. In 1867 he was back in Timosoara. A letter has been preserved, written to him by Dragi≈°a Milutinoviƒá, to inform Koder that the book \\"A Grammar of the Persian Language\\" had been procured and sent to him, as he had requested.Pismo, Rukopisno odeljenje Matice Srpske, sign. 35985, Novi Sad In February 1868 he undertook a long journey around Italy, after which he returned to Bucharest and then to Timi»ôoara, where he continued studying Turkish and Arabic, planning to translate Romoranka to the latter.Jedno ne≈°tampano pismo brata ƒêorƒëa Markoviƒáa Kodera Mariji Milutinoviƒá, Zbornik Matice srpske za KJ, 1985, knj.

As an interpreter for Arabic and Turkish, he went on a number of missions with the British embassy staff, including at least one journey to northern Africa.\\"ƒêorƒëe Markoviƒá Koder\\", Stani≈°a Vojinoviƒá, Narodna knjiga, Beograd, 2005 Some 16 years later, when most of his friends had believed he had been long dead, he suddenly returned to Novi Sad in 1888. Despite his age (82) he was in good health.

In 1890 he lived in \\"Ubogi dom\\", a refuge for homeless people in Novi Sad. There he surrounded himself with a number of cats and dogs, which he had befriended. He died on April 30, 1891. Work ƒêorƒëe Markoviƒá Koder was an active and relatively prolific writer, even though he only managed to publish one book, Romoranka, containing his 10.000 verses long poem together with the author's notes and explanations. His four other long poems ‚Äì San Matere Srbske, Devesilje, Mitologije and Iskoni ‚Äì were collected and published in 1979 by Bo≈æo Vukadinoviƒá, in a book titled Spevovi. He also wrote Slovar, a dictionary aimed at expounding and clarifying the notions used in his poetry. It was published in 2005 by Narodna biblioteka \\"Vuk Karad≈æiƒá\\".Mitolo≈°ki Reƒçnik, ƒêorƒëe Markoviƒá Koder, Narodna biblioteka \\"Vuk Karad≈æiƒá\\", Kragujevac, 2005, In his attempt to explain and describe his vision of the world by means of poetry, Koder had to construct a number of notions and corresponding terms. Most of his terminology is based on Serbian language, but derivatives of foreign words were also used, as well as a number of archaisms, compound nouns and words whose meaning can be inferred from the sound rather than the semantics. His dictionary contains most of his terminology, but many notions were explained using other incomprehensible constructs, obscure wording or recursive definitions. What's more, the dictionary does not follow alphabetical order, which makes it even more complicated to comprehend. Some of the definitions in the dictionary were given in different languages, while some terms were explained by drawings and mathematical formulas. Koder's personal mythology often features various species of plants and birds, as well as dreams, spirits, fairies and cosmical forces, whose complex interplay forms the very basis of our existence. Even though generally coherent and consistent in itself, his work is extremely hermetic and self-contained, almost impenetrable even to the most educated readers. Criticism When it was published, in 1862, Romoranka attracted some attention in Serbian literary circles in Novi Sad and Belgrade, but the main problem with it was that hardly anyone could understand what it was about. Even though Koder claimed to have used the words he learned from old women and peasants all around Serbia, it is possible that many of those words were actually invented by himself. Romoranka was described by Jovan Jovanoviƒá Zmaj as \\"incomprehensible, obscure and impossible to understand, despite the explanations that comprise one third of the book.\\" List \\"Javor\\", broj 26, 15. septembar 1862, kolumna \\"Nek se zna\\", autor J. Jovanoviƒá Zmaj Jovan Skerliƒá, a prominent Serbian literary critic of the time, described Koder's Romoranka as \\"the most insane book of our romanticism, a blurry symbolic description of lives of birds and plants.\\" Koder's \\"preposterous language\\" was, according to Skerliƒá, \\"a sickly original vocabulary\\", and his whole opus could only be described as \\"the jester's hat on the head of Serbian literature\\".Jovan Skerliƒá, Omladina i njena knji≈æevnost, Beograd, 1906, 416-418 References Category:1806 births Category:1891 deaths Category:Serbian male poets Category:19th-century poets ","title":"ƒêorƒëe Markoviƒá Koder"},{"id":"32454008","text":"Epsilon Doradus, Latinzied from Œµ Doradus, is a solitary star located in the southern constellation of Dorado.

Bach composed the cantata after several complete cantata cycles written in Leipzig for the occasions of the liturgical year. The cantata text resembles works which his second cousin Johann Ludwig Bach set to music. Based on the prescribed gospel reading of the great catch of fish, an unknown librettist based his poetry on quotations from the Old Testament in the opening movement and the New Testament as the central movement, and closed it by the final stanza of Georg Neumark's hymn \\"\\". The cantata is structured in seven movements in two parts (three and four movements), to be performed before and after the sermon. It is scored for an intimate ensemble of four vocal soloists, a choir only in the chorale, two horns, two oboes d'amore, taille, strings and continuo. The central movement is composed as a biblical scene, with the Evangelist introducing Jesus sending Peter, a fisherman, to \\"fish\\" men.  History and words  Portrait of Johann Ludwig Bach Bach composed the cantata in Leipzig for the Fifth Sunday after Trinity. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the First Epistle of Peter, \\"Sanctify the Lord God in your hearts\\", and from the Gospel of Luke, , Peter's great catch of fish. The text of this cantata and six others is similar in structure and content to cantatas texts set by Johann Ludwig Bach, his second cousin. The theme is derived from the gospel. A related verse of Jeremiah () opens the cantata. The prophecy referred originally to the return from the captivity in Babylon. The central movement, opening the second part to be performed after the sermon, is the quotation of verse 10 from the gospel. The cantata is closed by the final stanza of Georg Neumark's hymn \\"\\" (1641). This chorale had served as the base for Bach's chorale cantata for the same occasion in 1724, , part of his second annual cycle. Bach led the first performance of the cantata on 21 July 1726.  Music   Scoring and structure  The cantata is structured in two parts to be performed before and after the sermon, the first part in three solo movements, the second in three solo movements and a closing chorale. It is scored for four vocal soloists (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir SATB only in the chorale, two horns (Co), two oboes d'amore (Oa), taille (Ot), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo (Bc). The duration is given as 22 minutes. The autograph title page reads: \\"Domin. 5 post Trinit. / Siehe, ich will viel Fischer aussenden, / a / 4 Voci / 2 Corni / 3 Hautb. d'Amour / 2 Viol. / Viola / e / Cont. / di / J.S.Bach.\\" In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach- Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred D√ºrr, using the symbols for common time (4/4) and alla breve (2/2). The instruments are shown separately for winds and strings, while the continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.  Movements   1  The opening movement, \\"\\" (Behold, I will send out many fishers), is given to the bass solo, possibly because Jeremiah has God speak in the first person. The music follows the text in two sections, as in a motet. Probably therefore Bach avoided the title aria and wrote instead. Some cantatas on texts by Christiana Mariana von Ziegler from the second annual cycle begin in a similar way with a bible quotation, of Jesus saying \\"\\" (I am a Good Shepherd, BWV 85), \\"\\" (It is good for you that I leave, BWV 108), and Jesus saying \\"\\" (Until now you have asked for nothing in My name, BWV 87). The two sections reflect two concepts mentioned in the text, (fishermen) and (hunters). The first section paints a seascape in undulating figuration of the strings with the oboes in 6/8 time on a pedal point. Bach \\"represents the movement of waves and water\\", which is termed barcarolle by John Eliot Gardiner, the conductor of the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000. The voice presents the text several times in varied declamation. Suddenly the scene changes to a hunting scene, horns join the orchestra, the tempo in common time is marked \\"\\". The voice is again set in expressive declamation, saying \\"And afterwards I will send out many hunters ...\\".  2  The recitative \\"\\" (How easily could the Highest do without us), ends on a question, \\"Does He ... abandon us to the deceit and trickery of the enemy?\\"  3  The answer is given in the aria \\"\\" (No, God is always concerned), It begins immediately, without the usual ritornello, a passionate: \\"\\" (No, no). The middle section begins with a contrasting, but also passionate \\"\\" (Yes, yes). In the very end, the strings join the obbligato oboe d'amore and play a ritornello, reminiscent of a minuet. According to Alfred D√ºrr, the clear, even structure may symbolize the \\"\\" (\\"right path\\" or \\"true path\\") mentioned in the text.  4  Movement 4 is a scene from the gospel, and forms the centre of the composition. The tenor as the Evangelist announces \\"\\" (Jesus said to Simon). The direct speech of Jesus, calling Peter as his disciple, is sung by the bass as the vox Christi (voice of Christ): \\"\\" (Fear not, from henceforth thou shalt catch men). The careful phasing is set on a continuo quasi ostinato.  5  A duet of soprano and alto, \\"\\" (If God Himself calls, then blessing) reflects God's blessing  6  A recitative of the soprano, \\"\\" (What then can frighten you in your journey) expresses the comsequence.  7  The closing chorale confirms, \\"\\" (Sing, pray and walk in God's ways). It is a four-part setting.  Recordings  The listing is taken from the selection provided on the Bach Cantatas Website.

The Erlacherhof is the most representative patrician town mansion in Bern. It is the only Bernese town mansion in the Old City of Bern that has a courtyard. It is not open to the public.  History  The Erlacherhof was built between 1745 and 1752 after the plans of the Bernese architect Albrecht St√ºrler for the Bernese patrician Hieronymus von Erlach in place of two older houses of which one was the old town house of the von Erlach family. The other house belonged once to the family of Adrian von Bubenberg. In 1748, both the owner and the architect died before the mansion was completed. It was the son of Hieronymus von Erlach, Albrecht Friedrich von Erlach, who gave order to complete the mansion, most probably with the help of the sculptor Johann August Nahl. In honour of his father, Albrecht Friedrich von Erlach decorated the pediments of the east and west wing courtyard fa√ßades with the crowned monogram of his father \\"HvE\\", Hieronymus von Erlach. Courtyard with the main entrance of the Erlacherhof In 1795, the mansion was bought by the butcher Albrecht Hegi and the merchant David Rudolf Bay. After the decline of the Ancien R√©gime of Switzerland and the French invasion of Bern, the Erlacherhof became the seat of the French general Guillaume Brune in 1798. Afterwards, the Erlacherhof was used as a school building before it became the French Embassy in 1831. From 1848 until 1857, the mansion was the first official seat of the Swiss Federal Council. Today, the Erlacherhof and its terraced garden are restored to their former glory. The mansion is now the official seat of the mayor of Bern and his administration.

It is at the southern end of Binjiang Dao () in Heping District. The cathedral is one of Tianjin's protected historical relics.http://www2.tjfdc.gov.cn/Lists/List6/DispForm.aspx?ID=13809 The church was built in 1913 under the name of MG Church before it was renamed St. Joseph's Church. It is the largest Roman Catholic Church in Tianjin.  History  In 1912, the Holy See issued an edict, announced by Zhili Vicariate on behalf of the Northern Territory Zhili Vicariate. Tianjin's Bishop House was located near the Sancha River in the Wanghailou Church, and the first apostolic vicar was Paul-Marie Dumond of the Congregation of the Mission. In August 1913, construction began, and each brick had to be shipped from France. In June 1916, Xikai was completed and became the main cathedral for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tianjin. Afterward, Bishop Paul-Marie Dumond opened the St. Joseph's Primary School (now Tianjin No. 21 Middle School). Since then the diocese also acquired a St. Joseph's School of Law and the Catholic Hospital (now Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Tianjin). At the start of construction, the French concession of Tianjin was ordered to station police in the area. On October 20, 1916, however, the French stationed police was forced to disarm by local Chinese police who detained the bridge and caused massive public protests in Tianjin. Later, the Sino-French people of the region maintained control. On August 23, 1966, the Red Guards attacked the area, during which three towers were destroyed and were not rebuilt until the 1980s. The 1976 Tangshan earthquake also caused some damage. The two front shock towers at the base of the dome were severely damaged, and the repairs to the base did not begin until 1979. They were completed in the Fall of 1980 when the official opening was celebrated. In August 1991, August, Xikai was listed on Tianjin's cultural relics protection list. As of today, the church is still the largest Catholic Church in the Tianjin metropolitan area. Architectural style Inside Xikai Cathedral Xikai Cathedral profile Xikai is northern China's largest Romanesque church, with an area of 1891.95 square meters and can accommodate 1,500 people. The giant dome has a \\"product\\" shape with a green copper surface on the outside, supported by a wood structure and topped with a bronze cross. At the time it was built, the bishop refused to install a lightning rod on the dome, but 50 years later it was added. However, 80 years later when the area became a commercial center for Tianjin, the church was no longer the tallest building and therefore no longer required a lightning rod. Xikai's walls are checkered with red and yellow tiles and framed with white water masonry. Circular windows, columns, large indoor paintings, a large pipe organ, and semi-circular windows accent the building. The entrance consists of two doors in the back of Xikai, originally meant to allow men and women to enter through separate doors. The interior of Xikai is based on French and Roman architecture styles. The long main hall is lined by 14 large columns (two rows of seven), leading to a gallery-style tee. The nave has a stacked composite side portico, supported by semi-circular tops. The tall central dome consists of an octagonal drum roof that complements the octagonal windows throughout the church. Its side windows are stained glass with inlay painting. Painted, ornate murals, full of Biblical scenes, cover the walls. Religious activities There are two Our Lady of China, Tianjin (OLCTJ) parishes that celebrate at this cathedral: Chinese and English. Every morning the Chinese parish holds a Mass, while also providing additional Saturday and Sunday services. The English speaking parish,https://www.facebook.com/olctj started in 2007 by Father Joseph Loftus, celebrates at 11:30am every Sunday, with special Masses around certain holidays. Since this parish began, the English speaking foreign celebrants have created a Council to run all of the parish activities including a Music Ministry, Youth Group, Rosary Group, potluck meals, an RCIA, and a Charity Ministry. More specifically, the Xikai English parish has developed partnerships to help with Tianjin's local Huiling Orphanagehttp://huiling.org.cn and TICCO.

It is sung by Mathilde, a princess of the Habsburg house, as she waits in the forest on the heights of R√ºtli for her Swiss lover, Arnold Melchthal. This aria represents an important development in the traditional form of the strophic romance aria. By expanding somewhat the traditionally minimal accompaniment, Rossini developed what has been called a \\"Gallo-Italian hybrid\\" that provided an important model for his contemporaries.Bartlet, p276.

Simple inhabitant of these fields, The hope and pride of the mountains That charms my mind and causes my fear? Ah! I can at least admit to myself! Melcthal, it's you I love; Without you I would have lost the day; And my gratitude excuses my love. Italian [Recitative] S'allontanano alfine!

Wujiquan is an ancient system known in the Three Kingdoms age of the renowned legendary Chinese physician, Hua Tuo (c 208), and with origins reputedly much older (2,000 BCE). As its name and the names of its individual 36 Characters indicate, it is derived from ancient Chinese, Daoist and pre-Daoist (shamanic ancient Chinese) concepts such as Yin-Yang, and also from natural climatic phenomena. The name of its creator(s) is unknown, but it is understood to have been originally taught at and included amongst the ancient systems taught at the Shaolin Temple (Songshan, Henan Province, China) from its early centuries until at least as late as the era of the Sino-Japanese Conflict (1937‚Äì1945). The authority for the assertion of the ancient origins and teaching within the original historical Shaolin Temple System from very early times is derived from one of the last Abbots of the Putian, Nan Pu Tuo (also formerly known as ‚ÄòQuanlin Yuan‚Äô), Southern Shaolin Temple (Fujian Province).Chee Kim Thong and Wujiquan: Reference to Chee learning Wujiquan from the Abbot of the Southern Shaolin Temple The Abbot of this historic temple, the Very Reverend Yik Cha‚Äôan Cha‚Äôan Sze taught this system (and Luohan Ru Yi Quan, and 18 Arhat Boxing) over the course of 3 years to his disciple, Chee Kim Thong (c 1920‚Äì2001) prior to the fall of the temple and invasion of Fujian by the Japanese ‚Äì Chee gave the system the nickname of ‚ÄòShaolin Tai-Ji‚Äô.

It released on 27 October 2011 coinciding with Diwali festival to mixed reviews at the box office. The music is composed by Pritam and lyrics were by Mayur Puri. The film bears a resemblance to Malini's first directional venture Dil Aashna Hai (1992) and is an unofficial remake of the 2008 Hollywood hit Mamma Mia!. Plot The film tells the story of a girl named Tanya (Esha Deol) who learns that she was adopted by Colonel Ravi Kapoor and his wife when he rescued her from a burning hospital. This leads Tanya to go on a journey in search of her biological parents. The first man she visits is the ruler of a patriarchal district in Rajasthan, Abhay Rana Pratap Singh (Vinod Khanna), where female infanticide is common. However, it is revealed that Manjuri, brought up as Singh's niece, is his actual daughter. Her nanny had hidden the truth from everyone and even Rana Pratap hadn't known that his wife had given birth to a baby girl before dying in a fire. Tanya then travels to Turkey to meet Altaf Zardari (Rishi Kapoor). Zardari and his non-Indian wife live a peaceful life, but the wife doesn't remember losing her baby girl in the fire that demolished the hospital Tanya was born in. Tanya helps her regain her memory about the incident and accept her daughter's death. A heartbroken Tanya returns to India to her foster parents. She then embarks on one last mission to find her father - this time to see Tony Castello (Dharmendra), a mafia leader. Initially doubtful of her, Tony meets up with his ex-flame, Susan (Hema Malini), who is now a nun. Eventually, after a gang fight, Tony accepts Tanya as his daughter and the movie ends with Tanya and her best friend (Arjan Bajwa) marrying in a church, with all four of Tanya's fathers walking her down the aisle.

J. Auditory evoked potentials: Basic principles and clinical application. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Part of the auditory brainstem response (ABR), the FFR reflects sustained neural activity integrated over a population of neural elements: \\"the brainstem response...can be divided into transient and sustained portions, namely the onset response and the frequency-following response (FFR)\\". It is often phase- locked to the individual cycles of the stimulus waveform and/or the envelope of the periodic stimuli. It has not been well studied with respect to its clinical utility, although it can be used as part of a test battery for helping to diagnose auditory neuropathy. This may be in conjunction with, or as a replacement for, otoacoustic emissions. History In 1930, Wever and Bray discovered a potential called the \\"Wever-Bray effect\\".Wever, E. G. & Bray, C. W. (1930a) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. Wash. 16. 344.Wever, E. G. & Bray, C. W. (1930b). J. Exp Psychol. 13, 373. They originally believed that the potential originated from the cochlear nerve, but it was later discovered that the response is non-neural and is cochlear in origin, specifically from the outer hair cells. This phenomenon came to be known as the cochlear microphonic (CM). The FFR may have been accidentally discovered back in 1930; however, renewed interest in defining the FFR did not occur until the mid-1960s. While several researchers raced to publish the first detailed account of the FFR, the term \\"FFR\\" was originally coined by Worden and Marsh in 1968, to describe the CM-like neural components recorded directly from several brainstem nuclei (research based on Jewett and Williston‚Äôs work on click ABR's). Stimulus parameters The recording procedures for the scalp-recorded FFR are essentially the same as the ABR. A montage of three electrodes is typically utilized: An active electrode, located either at the top of the head or top of the forehead, a reference electrode, located on an earlobe, mastoid, or high vertebra, and a ground electrode, located either on the other earlobe or in the middle of the forehead. The FFR can be evoked to sinusoids, complex tones, steady-state vowels, tonal sweeps, or consonant-vowel syllables. The duration of those stimuli is generally between 15-150 milliseconds, with a rise time of 5 milliseconds. The polarity of successive stimuli can be either fixed or alternating. There are many reasons for, and effects of, alternating polarity. When stimulus delivery technology is not properly shielded, the electromagnetic acoustic transducer may induce the stimulus directly into the electrodes. This is known as a stimulus artifact, and researchers and clinicians seek to avoid it, as it is a contamination of the true recorded response of the nervous system. If stimulus polarities alternate, and responses are averaged over both polarities, stimulus artifact can be guaranteed to be absent. This is because the artifact changes polarity with the physical stimuli, and thus will average to nearly zero over time. Direct physiological responses to the stimuli such as the CM, however, also alternate polarity with the stimuli and will also be absent. Subtracting the responses to the two polarities yields the portions of the signal canceled out in the average. Such decomposition of the responses is not readily possible if the stimuli have constant polarity. Clinical applicability Due to the lack of specificity at low levels, the FFR has yet to make its way into clinical settings. Only recently has the FFR been evaluated for encoding complex sound and binaural processing.Krishnan, A. (2002). Human frequency‚Äìfollowing responses: Representation of steady-state synthetic vowels. Hearing Research, 166, 192-201.Krishnan, A., Parkinson, J. (2000). Human frequency-following response: Representation of tonal sweeps. Audiology and Neurootology, 5, 312-321.Krishnan, A., Xu, Y., Gandour, J. T., Cariani, P. A. (2004). Human frequency-following response: Representation of pitch contours in Chinese tones. Hearing Research, 189, 1-12. There may be uses for the information the FFR can provide regarding steady state, time-variant, and speech signals for better understanding of individuals with hearing loss and its effects. FFR distortion products (FFR DPs) could supplement low frequency (< 1000 Hz) DPOAEs. FFRs have the potential to be used to evaluate the neural representation of speech sounds processed by different strategies employed by users of cochlear implants, primarily identification and discrimination of speech. Also, phase-locked neural activity reflected in the FFR has been successfully used to predict auditory thresholds. Research directions Currently, there is renewed interest in using the FFR to evaluate: the role of neural phase-locking in encoding of complex sounds in normally hearing and hearing impaired subjects, encoding of voice pitch, binaural hearing, and evaluating the characteristics of the neural version of cochlear nonlinearity. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the temporal pattern of phase-locked brainstem neural activity generating the FFR may contain information relevant to the binaural processes underlying spatial release from masking (SRM) in challenging listening environments.Rouhbakhsh, N., 2016.

It is owned by Folkestone and Hythe District Council and managed by the Romney Warren Project, which is a partnership between Folkestone and Hythe District Council, Romney Warren Charitable Trust, Kent Wildlife Trust and Romney Marsh Countryside Partnership. It is part of the Dungeness, Romney Marsh and Rye Bay Ramsar internationally important wetland site and Site of Special Scientific Interest. History The history of Romney Warren begins over two thousand years ago, when sand dunes were formed along the coast. As new sand dunes were formed, sea retreated. Plants then recolonised, the former sand dunes to make a unique plant life environment. Later, the reclaimed land of the Romney Marshes was used for grazing large numbers of sheep for many centuries. These wool fleeces paid for the large churches in the villages across the marshes. In 1931 to 1945, sand and gravel was extracted from the land within the country park. These later were made into wildlife ponds. Later the land was then used as a transport depot. The Romney Warren Project was then established in 1995 with the aims of promoting awareness of the Romney Marsh as an historic landscape while providing training and employment for disabled and unemployed people. It is a partnership between Folkestone and Hythe District Council, Romney Warren Charitable Trust, Nelson Park Gardens (local care home) and Shepway Volunteer Centre, Romney Marsh Countryside Project and Kent Wildlife Trust. The main visitor centre was designed by the Baker-Brown McKay Partnership. The techniques and materials used mean the building has a life span of at least 100 years. The foundations are steel gabions filled with cobblestones from Lydd, these have been handpicked and filled. The main framework of the building is made of larch, from the West Country. This part was built first so that the roof could be added next, and so a cover was provided for the straw during the next building process. 350 straw bales were placed to form the walls, held together with chestnut poles. Even the roof has been designed with wildlife in mind, as it is covered in sedum as a green roof. The roof covers the building's entire footprint, replacing the habitat which would have otherwise been lost. The building was 'Highly Commended' at the 2003 Kent Design Awards. Facilities Romney Warren Visitor Centre As a Site of Special Scientific Interest, it is a nationally important site for great crested newts. Species of special interest include great diving beetles, Small Red-eyed Damselfly and tree sparrow, along with a number of acid grassland plants. The Romney Warren Project granted a lease to the Kent Wildlife Trust (KWT) to manage the Romney Marsh Visitor Centre. It opened in 2004 and provides facilities for visitors to the Country Park including exhibitions, local information, a shop, toilets and refreshments. Three walking trails - dragonfly, rabbit and sheep ‚Äì start from the Visitor Centre. There are regular family events held at the park and booked groups are welcome to use the visitor centre. The Romney Marsh Countryside Project has done a great deal to improve the landscape of Romney Marsh and Dungeness for wildlife and people. Volunteers work at New Romney Warren Country Park to maintain footpaths and a pond created by the Romney Marsh Countryside Project. Part of the site is used by Nelson Park Gardens and Shepway Volunteer Centre as a horticultural and landscaping training scheme for adults from local care homes and the unemployed; their produce is then sold at the Visitor Centre.

Unusually among ctenophores, which normally prefer warmer waters, it is found in the Arctic and adjacent polar seas, mostly in surface waters down to . In addition to being weakly bioluminescent in blues and greens, comb jellies produce a rainbow effect similar to that seen on an oil slick, and which is caused by interference of incident light on the eight rows of moving cilia or comb rows which propel the organism. The comb rows beat sequentially, rather like the action of a Mexican wave. The comb rows also function as chemical sense organs, serving the same role as insect antennae. Mertensia ovum is the major source of bioluminescence from Arctic gelatinous zooplankton. This species, like other ctenophores, has a large body cavity and is carnivorous, feeding on copepods and small crustaceans snagged by its two extremely sticky and robust tentacles (see Tentaculata). These are long and contractile with numerous lateral tentillae or side branches bearing colloblasts, each of which consists of a coiled spiral filament, structurally similar to a nematocyst, but instead of injecting a toxin, release an adhesive substance which ensnares the prey. These tentacles can be retracted into a tentacle sheath. The body is on the whole light pink in colour, oval in the tentacular plane and considerably compressed in the sagittal plane. Its unconventional brain consists of a network of nerves arranged under its outer skin. A study in the Barents Sea found that it ingests prey ranging from small copepods to amphipods and krill, but that its staple diet consists of large copepod species such as Calanus finmarchicus, Calanus glacialis, Calanus hyperboreus and Metridia longa. Like garden snails, Mertensia is hermaphroditic, reproducing sexually and occasionally asexually. Eggs and sperm are ejected into the water and from the fertilized eggs ovoid larvae develop. The planktonic larvae of this species are long while adults grow up to . The genus Mertensia commemorates the German naturalist Karl Heinrich Mertens aka Andrei Karlovich Mertens (17 May 1796 ‚Äì 18 September 1830). Mertens accompanied the Russian naturalist Alexander Philipov Postels aboard the Senyavin in 1826 on a voyage to \\"reconnoitre and describe the coasts of Kamchatka, the land of the Chuchkis and the Koriaks (the coasts of which have not yet been described by anyone, and which are unknown except by the voyage of Captain Bering); the coasts of the Okhotsk Sea, and the Shantar Islands, which although they are known to us, have not been sufficiently described.\\" References External links  Category:Tentaculata Category:Bioluminescent ctenophores Category:Animals described in 1780 ","title":"Mertensia ovum"},{"id":"32454491","text":"Sin Suk-ju (Korean: Ïã†ÏàôÏ£º, hanja: Áî≥ÂèîËàü; August 2, 1417 - July 23, 1475) was a Korean politician during the Joseon Dynasty.

Plot summary A beautiful woman, Stella Raphael, lives an unimaginative family life: she runs the household and takes care of her son Charlie while her husband Max works as a deputy superintendent at a maximum security psychiatric hospital. This all changes when she becomes romantically involved with Edgar Stark, an artistic talented patient who restores the old Victorian conservatory. Edgar is committed for the violent murder of his wife but this does not influence Stella's feelings. Then Edgar escapes from the institution wearing Max's clothes and takes a hiding in a shabby building in London which he uses as a studio. Stella's love for him grows stronger and while in London for \\"shopping\\" she manages to get back in contact with Edgar via his artist friend Nick. Her visits become more and more frequent and it starts to become suspicious so she decides to leave her family permanently. The asylum wants to keep this potentially scandalous situation out of the papers but informs the police. At first Stella enjoys the underground art life but Edgar starts to become violent and jealous as he sculpts a rather morbid bust of her head. He thinks she wants to go back to Max and fears being poisoned by her. Stella, realizing the danger, finds shelter at Nick's home but she has to flee again as Edgar tries to locate her. As she feels her love again, she returns to Edgar's studio where she is arrested by the police who have lost track of Edgar. Stella reunites with her family. Max is fired from the asylum due to the affair, so they move to the Welsh countryside where Max can work for another mental hospital. She now has to regain the trust of her son and Max, but she doesn't make much of an effort as she is still in love with Edgar despite his disturbing behaviour. As the family gets more depressed, Stella has simple sex with her neighbour to pass the time waiting for her lover to find her. Her hope for reunion with Edgar is strengthened when he is arrested by the police near their house. During a school trip with her son she fails to help him as he drowns in a swamp. She is found guilty of infanticide and institutionalised at the asylum where Max used to work. The asylum is now run by Peter Cleave, who wants to help her cure from her Medea complex, hoping that their friendship will evolve into a marriage. She seems to agree, but Peter doesn't take into account that her love for Edgar - also in the hospital in solitary - still reigns. Stella commits suicide using the pills she didn't swallow as she can't be somebody else's lover. Peter keeps the bronze bust of Stella that Edgar made in his desk's drawer.

North of this section is Shaupeneak Mountain, which bends to the north-northwest before reaching an area known as The Hell, a gap in the ridge through which a creek flows. North of this gap is Hussey Hill, which stretches to an area west of Port Ewen, New York, marking the northernmost limit of the Marlboro Mountains.Topoquest (Map Center: N41.72506, W73.98877; overview of Marlboro Mountains).

In the case of the mountains, the name comes from the Duke of Marlborough, for whom the town of Marlborough, New York, is named. The names of the individual ridges of the Marlboro Mountains have both European and Native American roots: Hussey Hill is named for Frederick Hussey, a Dutch colonial settler who in 1685 had an interest in a 2,900 acre tract of land which extended to the foot of the hill.Clearwater, Alphonso T. The History of Ulster County, New York, Volume 1. Originally published by W.J. Van Deusen, Kingston, NY, 1907. Reprint by Heritage Books Inc, Westminster, MD, 2001. . Shaupeneak Mountain features a Native American name of Munsee Lenape origin. The name is derived from a waterfall, Shaupeneak Falls, located on the mountain's slope. The three syllables which comprise ‚Äúshau-pe-neak‚Äù are thought to be defined as follows: shau (probably short for Asho-, as in Ashokan), meaning forceful or hard current/rapids; pe, meaning water; and neak (likely ny-ak), meaning a prominent point of land.Pritchard, Evan.

During the early 1800s, there was a westward migration of New Englanders to the area of the former Northwest Territory, which included Illinois and Ohio. Some settlers, however, never reached their intended destination, being cut off by the swamps just west of the Marlboro Mountains. Setting up homesteads in the area, the settlers named local places and geographic features after the lands they never reached. Ohioville, New York is an example of another area with the same etymological lineage.Maguire, Jack. Of Turtles, Pioneers, Falcons, and Moss.

Available Online History Though occupied and utilized by people for thousands of years, the Marlboro Mountains, which have historically provided timber, game, and agricultural land, were more intensely exploited for their resources in the past two centuries than at any other time in human history. Today, due to a decline in agriculture and logging in the mountains, some of the ridges have begun reverting to a more natural state. An information board erected by the Scenic Hudson Land Trust at the ridge-top parking area of the Shaupeneak Ridge Cooperative Recreation Area summarizes the history of human impact on the mountains, with emphasis on the Shaupeneak Ridge: In addition to their consumable resources, the mountains have provided quiet solitude and escape. It is in the Marlboro Mountains that naturalist and essayist John Burroughs, with the aid of his son Julian, constructed Slabsides, a cabin retreat which he used in the summer. Hussey Hill Gold Hussey Hill seen from Port Ewen, New York A series of infamous events in the history of the Marlboro Mountains and the town of Esopus involves gold mining operations at Hussey Hill. In the 1870s, a Kingston chemist and physician, Edgar Eltinge, claimed that he had found gold at Hussey Hill. Though locals doubted his find, Eltinge, along with another man, Royal Dimmick, bought a lease on the hill. After forming the Hudson River Gold & Silver Mining Company the two began mining for gold in 1877.A Time Line of Important Events Affecting the Town of Esopus. Klyne Esopus Museum .

Ultimately, the men claimed to find gold-bearing quartz. However, the gold that was found was supposedly not enough to make up for recovery costs, the mine closing after just eighteen months. Later, in an odd twist, Dimmick's son claimed to develop a second sight which allowed him to sense gold deposits. The Dimmicks would lead Eltinge and others on fruitless gold finding expeditions in the Shawangunks and Catskills, leaving their followers broke. In 1879, the owners of the land on Hussey Hill granted a lease to Simon S. Westbrook, who had purchased the Hudson River Gold & Silver Mining Company's equipment at foreclosure. Westbrook became involved with the Home Gold and Silver Mining Company, which established offices in Esopus and New York City. The company quickly acquired two million dollars in investment funds to work the mine on Hussey Hill. Much of this funding was raised through public viewings of weekend dig operations directed by a company sales associate. As with Eltinge and Dimmick, no appreciable gold was ever verifiably found, and none of the gold supposedly produced was ever shown. The last gasp of gold fever at Hussey Hill occurred in 1891. A farmer, Conrad Burger, claimed he discovered a rock on his farm at the base of Hussey Hill which contained gold. A sample of the rock was sent to New York City to verify the claim, and it was judged to actually contain gold. However, whether the rock came from Hussey Hill is questionable. In spite of this fact, Burger managed to sell a twenty-year lease to three men hoping to strike gold on his property.Visions of Great Wealth: A Farmer Thinks He Has Found Gold in Ulster County.

View Article Geology The Marlboro Mountains are primarily formed of shallow marine/delta sediments deposited during the late Ordovician, approximately 450 million years ago.Waines, Russell H. The Quassaic Group, a Medial to Late Ordovician arenite sequence in the Marlboro Mountains Outlier, mid-Hudson Valley, New York, U.S.A. Geological Journal, Volume 21, Issue 3, pages 337‚Äì351, July/September 1986. After millions of years, these sediments have been titled and uplifted. Weathering has removed more easily eroded material surrounding the mountains, producing their modern topographic relief. Structurally, the Marlboro Mountains constitute a geologic formation known as a dip slope. The sedimentary layers comprising the bulk of the mountains dip towards the west, with a hard cap rock layer at the surface. The ridgeline of the mountains forms the edge of the cap rock layer, which is being eroded relatively slowly, protecting underlying geologic layers from being weathered. This setup leads to the hogback appearance of the mountains: gently sloping westward flanks and steeply graded eastern flanks. The hard cap rock layer responsible for the mountains' topography is composed of rock of the Quassaic Group (named after Quassaic Creek), a geologic group consisting of hard sandstone and quartzite. Quartzite, which consists of sandstone that has been recrystallized, is naturally resistant to erosion. This type of rock is common to other ridges in the Appalachian Mountains.

He was a trombone soloist with the Army band while stationed in Little Rock, Arkansas, during the Korean War. After the war, he moved to California, where he played trombone in the house bands at numerous Sacramento and Lake Tahoe venues. Music Educator Tucker mentored numerous students as a classical composer and music teacher. He mentored numerous students at Fiatarones Music Store in Pinole, California, in music, music education, and composition. Among professional composers who studied with Tucker are Rolf Johnson, Michael Wolff, and Susan Muscarella of the JazzSchool in Berkeley. Director of the University of California Jazz Ensembles Within a couple years of Tucker's assuming the position of director, increasing interest of more student musicians to join the big band led to the creation of, two additional big bands, the Tuesday Night Band and the Thursday Night Band, with the original big band, composed of the most skilled of the jazz musicians, named the Wednesday Night Band. Tucker directed the University of California Jazz Ensembles until 1985, his early retirement resulting largely from a bad back that had him lying flat for a year. Each year 100 students worked under his direction in the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday night big bands, combos, and classes. Under Tucker's guidance, the University of California Jazz Ensembles became the most successful and visible performing arts organization on the Cal campus. The bands of the University of California Jazz Ensembles performed throughout California, at cultural venues such as the Oakland Art Museum and International House, once or twice weekly on campus, and at student and administration functions, including receptions for the Chancellor of the Berkeley campus. The first tier band, the Wednesday Night Band, was sponsored by the government of Poland to travel to Poland to perform at Katowice University in 1979 and the Montreux Jazz Festival(1979) U.C. Berkeley Jazz Band invited to perform at Montreux Festival, Berkeley Gazette, March 18, p. 23. arranged for the group to perform as the featured collegiate band during the trip and paid for its travel to Switzerland. The total trip lasted four weeks, with other sponsored-appearances in the four Scandinavian countries. Tucker had formed a friendship with Japanese dignitaries during their educational trip to Berkeley, and the prefectures of Okayama and Hyogo jointly sponsored the group on a Japanese tour during 1981. The group received critical acclaim and a last-minute concert was arranged by the sponsors at the Japanese major league baseball Korakuen Stadium. Recognition In the service with the army he was principal trombone with the Fort Smith Symphony and directed the 5th Armored Division public relations tours and radio broadcasts. In Sacramento, he taught at the elementary, high school, where he was music department chairman, and college levels. He was director of bands at Sacramento City College and taught at Sacramento State College. At the same time, he was the curriculum supervisor for the Sutter Union School District. He adjudicated and was featured conductor at various jazz festivals throughout the state of California. He received numerous honors as an educator and conductor and held numerous leadership positions in music and educator associations. Tucker also received awards for his marching band arrangements and a Cal Berkeley award as an educator. Record Producer Beginning in 1974, Tucker produced recordings of UC Jazz under various labels. The 1979 European Tour band recorded UC Berkeley Jazz Ensemble Vol. 1, 1979 at the College for Recording Arts in San Francisco, and the 1981 Japan Tour band recorded Orange Blossom Special at Polydor Studios in Tokyo, Japan. Influence Many student musicians who studied privately with Tucker or who performed with UC Jazz became musicians, band leaders, and music educators in their own right as a result of their experience with Tucker. These include pianist, band leader, and composer Michael Wolff, steel drum player Andy Narell, and bass guitarist Dave Meros (who played bass trombone in the jazz ensemble). Others, provided the opportunity to be soloists and announcers for the organization, embarked on careers as musician agents, music producers, radio disk jockeys, and stand-up comedians. UC Jazz continues as a viable organization on the Cal Berkeley campus, celebrating its 44th anniversary in 2011.

They consist of Ed Wallis (vocals, guitar), Leon Dufficy (guitar), Ben Walker (drums, vocals), Steve Blackwell (bass) and Henry Thomas (keyboards, vocals) have released four albums to date and have toured both Europe and North America. Their most recent record is Sun Bridge, released in October 2017. History The band was formed in 2004 by frontman Ed Wallis after his previous outfit, which included Nick Goss, had dissolved, after the two had moved down to London to attend university. Wallis decided to \\"record a load of songs myself and call it My Sad Captains\\".\\"Chatotisch interview\\" Editor, 'My Sad Captain Interview' Chaotisch Und Charmant, February 2010. He realised that the tracks would work better with a full band set-up and reconnected with Goss, while recruiting Jack Swayne on bass and Ed's brother Jim Wallis on drums. After the band had formed it wasn't 'until a year or so later that we were all living in London and taking it seriously'.\\"SoundsXP Interview 2008\\" Ged M, 'My Sad Captains: Ed Wallis interview' Soundsxp, 12 March 2008 The band became a five-piece when Cathy Lucas joined the band on violin, vocals and keyboards. The band decided to concentrate on their material and avoided to release something 'for the sake of it'. In 2007 they made their debut with a 7\\" single \\"Bad Decisions\\" b/w \\"Here and Elsewhere\\" for the Fortuna Pop! label. It was followed by \\"All Hat and No Plans\\" b/w \\"Great Expectations\\" released at the end of March 2008 through White Heat. Over the course of 2008, the band began recording their debut album with Paul Jones. While the sessions were self-financed, Jones, the co-owner of Stolen Recordings, made them 'an offer we couldn't refuse'.\\"America.net\\" Todd Cochran, 'Your New Favorite Band: My Sad Captains', Dumbing of America.net, 16 September 2009 In June 2009, the band released Here & Elsewhere. It was followed in 2011 by Fight Less, Win More on the same label. They released their third album, Best of Times, on 17 March 2014 through Bella Union. They spent much of the year on tour in support, while videos for the songs \\"Goodbye\\" and \\"Hardly There\\" appeared. Their fourth record, Sun Bridge, was released on 6 October 2017, also on Bella Union. It was described by Uncut as \\"A sumptuous synthesis of epiphanic pop and Krautrock‚Äìinflected drift and diffusion‚Ä¶ Few British bands since Spiritualized in their ‚Äò90s imperial phase have been as proficient at inducing a beatific state of drift\\". The band opened for The Sea and Cake on a UK tour in June 2018; their last live show so far was in October that year. Name The band's name comes from a poem by the Anglo-American poet Thom Gunn, Wallis explained that he decided 'to steal someone else‚Äôs idea rather than think of my own'. He simply liked the poem, but that there was 'no special significance to it'. Wallis discovered the book 'sitting on a shelf unattended, when I was looking for a name, and it seemed to capture some element of the music that I heard in my head'. The phrase itself originates from Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra Act III Scene 13: :\\"Come, :Let's have one other gaudy night: call to me :All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more; :Let's mock the midnight bell.\\" Discography Albums *Here & Elsewhere (Stolen Recordings, 2009) *Fight Less, Win More (Stolen Recordings, 2011) *Best of Times (Bella Union, 2014) *Sun Bridge (Bella Union, 2017) References External links * mysadcaptains.co.uk - Official Page - no longer online * Category:British indie rock groups Category:Bella Union artists ","title":"My Sad Captains"},{"id":"32454702","text":"The Pavilh√£o da Luz N¬∫ 2 is the second arena of Portuguese multi-sport club S.L.

It marked a second attempted comeback by The Knack, after their first attempt in 1991 with Serious Fun fizzled. Terry Bozzio served as the drummer on the album in place of The Knack's original drummer Bruce Gary. The album received positive reviews, including one that described it as the Knack's best effort since their debut album. The album was re-released several years later as Re-Zoom with three bonus tracks. Critical reception Allmusic critic Steve Erlewine praised the album as the \\"best album the maligned power-pop band has recorded since their debut,\\" Get The Knack. Writing in the Hartford Courant, Roger Catlin noted similarities between the opening song \\"Pop Is Dead\\", The Beatles' \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\", and The Who's Tommy; he also noted similarities between the album's second song \\"Can I Borrow a Kiss\\" and the classic song \\"Needles and Pins.\\" He commented that while the album initially seems \\"to be on a track to produce a classic in '60s rock emulation along the lines of Flamin' Groovies' Shake Some Action, some of the later tracks \\"disappoint.\\" Author John Borack called the album \\"a stunning effort\\" and called it his favorite album of the year. Trouser Press referred to the album as \\"a good, solid effort\\" that \\"isn't at all bad as slick, commercial Beatlesque power pop goes\\" but also noted that \\"the Knack is firmly caught in a dead zone between nostalgia, irrelevance and scorn.\\" The lyrics to the song \\"Can I Borrow a Kiss\\" were based on an incident from when songwriter Doug Fieger visited Haight-Ashbury in San Francisco as a teenager, and a girl asked if she could borrow a kiss. Fieger noted that that kind of thing didn't happen in his hometown of Oak Park, Michigan. The song \\"Terry & Julie Step Out\\" is based on The Kinks' song \\"Waterloo Sunset\\". Re-Zoom After the rights reverted to the band from its original label, The Knack re-released the album with additional tracks in 2003 under the title Re-Zoom. This release followed the band's next unsuccessful comeback with the album Normal as the Next Guy. Allmusic critic Steve Mason called Re-Zoom \\"probably the best Knack album since 1979's Get the Knack, with at least a few fine examples of pure L.A.-style power pop and a psychedelic closing ballad.\\" Mason also noted that although the songs on the album did not have misogynist lyrics like earlier The Knack songs, the lyrics are \\"still rather smug,\\" and that lead singer Doug Fieger sings \\"with a self-satisfaction unwarranted by his flagrantly derivative musical sense.\\" The additional tracks included covers of Badfinger's \\"No Matter What\\" and Elvis Costello's \\"Girls Talk.\\" 16\\\\. \\"Girls Talk\\" (Elvis Costello) - 3:26 17\\\\. \\"Mister Magazine\\" (Instrumental) - 4:01 18\\\\. \\"Harder on You\\" Prescott Niles, Berton Averre, Kim Amadril, Doug Fieger 19\\\\. \\"Tomorrow Prescott Niles, Berton Averre, Doug Fieger, Kim Amadril References Category:The Knack albums Category:1998 albums Category:2003 albums Category:Rhino Records albums ","title":"Zoom (The Knack album)"},{"id":"32454736","text":"The 1935 Women's Western Open was a golf competition held at Sunset Ridge Country Club, the 6th edition of the event.

The Animal Metaphor test consists of a series of creative and analytical prompts. Unlike conventional projective tests, the Animal Metaphor works as both a diagnostic and therapeutic battery. Unlike the Rorschach test and TAT, the Animal Metaphor is premised on self-analysis via self-report questions. The test combines facets of art therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and insight therapy, while also providing a theoretical platform of behavioral analysis. The test has been used widely as a clinical tool, as an educational assessment, and in human resource selection.

Taxonomy Given its name by Carlo Vittadini from Latin borchii (from von der Borch, the naturalist who described the species in 1780). Description It is from in size and rounded, with a tuber-like appearance, often bony or irregular. The exterior is slightly velvety and white at first, and when mature it has a smooth, reddish ochre surface with brown markings. It has a compact consistency and, when sectioned, the interior is whitish when young, light ochre or pinkish brown with age. A series of white, twisted and branched veins run through the interior. Young specimens give off a pleasant smell, but when mature they give off an unpleasant smell reminiscent of kitchen gas. The flavor is described by some as garlicky, by others as similar to hazelnuts. Seen through a microscope, the spores have an ellipsoidal to rounded shape, measuring 35-55 x 25-40 microns, and are brown in colour. The ascii are rather rounded and contain 1 to 4 spores.

There are many similar species: Tuber asa (with spores shaped like lemons when immature), Tuber oligospermum and Tuber puberulum (which has rounder spores). El Fascinant m√≥n dels bolets. Volum 2. Esp√®cies i fam√≠lies (I). ECRIC (Enciclop√®dia Catalana Revistes i Col¬∑leccionables), 2003. . P√†g. 49. Distribution and habitat Whitish truffles often grow in oak groves, and less frequently under conifers. Like most truffles, it bears fruit underground, although not very deep (occasionally, mature specimens reach the surface). It bears fruit from winter to early summer (from December to June), in coastal or low-lying areas (between 200 and 1,000 metres above sea level). El Fascinant m√≥n dels bolets. Volum 2. Esp√®cies i fam√≠lies (I). ECRIC (Enciclop√®dia Catalana Revistes i Col¬∑leccionables), 2003. . P√†g. 49. It is highly adaptable to different environments: although it prefers calcareous sandy soils (typical of coastal areas) it also bears fruit in black truffle (Tuber melanosporum) habitat at higher altitudes. It grows well in soils with a pH of 7-8, as well as in subalkalines with a pH of 6-7, although occasionally it also grows in soils with a pH as low as 5.2. It is found throughout Europe: from Finland to Italy (Tuscany, Abruzzo, Romagna, Umbria, Marche, Molise and SicilyCarluccio, A., 2003. The Complete Mushroom Book. Quadrille. .) and the Iberian Peninsula (Andalusia, Portugal, and Castile and Le√≥n), and from Ireland and Great Britain to Hungary and Poland. Use and cultivation It is harvested from winter to spring (from mid-January to the end of April in Italy), unlike Tuber magnatum, which is collected in autumn and early winter. It sells for some 300-400 ‚Ç¨/kg. Although it is not as sought after as Tuber magnatum or Tuber melanosporum, There are several reasons for its cultivation: it fruits early in new plantations (as early as 4 years in pine), is adaptable to different ecological niches, isn't extremely specific to host plants, and lastly, it is very competitive with other ectomycorrhizal fungi (particularly in young plantations).

She studied the interaction of culture and thinking, writing a monograph on the use of Piagetian tasks with schooled and unschooled children in Hong Kong. Early life and education Jacqueline Jarrett Goodnow was born on 25 November 1924, in Toowoomba, a middle size town in Queensland, Australia. She was the second of six children born to George Bellingen Jarrett and Florence Bickley Jarrett, a former secretary. Jacqueline's family moved to Sydney before she started high school. She attended a girl's high school there that did not offer physics, chemistry, or biology. Jarrett was enrolled at the University of Sydney at the age of sixteen and she graduated with first class honours in Psychology and a University Medal in 1944. She became a laboratory instructor at the university and worked as a temporary lecturer. Since the University of Sydney did not offer Ph.D. programs to women, Jarrett travelled to the United States and enrolled at Harvard; she received a Ph.D. from Radcliffe in clinical psychology. After graduating, she interned as a clinical psychologist at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington, D.C. While attending Harvard, Jarrett met and fell in love with Robert Goodnow, a fellow graduate student. She also developed psychometric tests for Europeans, mainly refugees who might work for the army. They married in October 1951. Contributions and achievements Jacqueline Jarrett Goodnow published eight books, over sixty journal articles and chapters. Some of her publications are titled: *Children Drawing (1977) *Children and Families in Australia: Contemporary Issues and Problems (1979) *Home and School: A Child‚Äôs Eye View (1985) *Women, Social Science and Public Policy (1985) Goodnow's contributions to psychology centred on six themes: two-choice learning studies, research on thinking, culture and thought, the effects of perception, children's drawings, and social policy. Two-choice learning studies \\"In the view of the dominant behaviorism of the time, rewards were important determinants of behavior. But Goodnow showed that, when reward is kept constant, behavior differs depending on how the subject defines the situation. In a ‚Äògambling‚Äô situation the tendency was to maximize reward, but in a problem-solving situation the subject considered longer runs of behavior, looking for a pattern, and an individual choice, win or lose, was not so important. Strategies, that are how the subject defined the situation, were also important in studies of concept attainment.\\" Research on thinking When it came to experiments on thinking, subjects were asked to pick their own strategies and reward was not important. ::\\"In a typical experiment situation the subjects sat facing a table with a number of cards on it. The task of the subject was to find the concept. The subject might be given a positive instance and told to find the concept. Subjects differed in the strategies they employed. A ‚Äúfocus‚Äù strategy was slow but sure, while a ‚Äúscanning‚Äù strategy put many requirements on memory and was more risky. Or the subjects might be given one instance at a time, starting with a positive concept, told to write a hypothesis, given another instance, told to write a hypothesis again, and so on, until the subject could define the concept. The subjects learned from the positive instances.\\" The purpose of this test was to show that when people need to learn concepts they employ a method or strategy to help their performance. Culture and thought Goodnow‚Äôs interest in culture and thought came after travelling to Hong Kong when she became interested in the thinking process of children from different cultures. She used Piaget‚Äôs conservation tasks and two combinational tasks. This study was conducted by giving 500 Chinese and European boys age ten to thirteen the Piagetian tasks of conservation of weight, volume, and space, along with Raven‚Äôs Progressive Matrices task and Piaget‚Äôs factorial problem. Children who were unschooled had difficulty in performing the tasks that were required for the factorial problem and the Progressive Matrices task. When she gave the tests to sample of ‚Äúaverage‚Äù (IQ 101‚Äì120) and ‚Äúdull‚Äù (IQ 64‚Äì88) boys in Montgomery County, Maryland she found that the US boys of average intelligence scores were similar to the schooled and semi-schooled Chinese boys on the conservation tasks. When it came to the dull US boys their scores were inferior to the schooled and semi-schooled Chinese boys on the combinational tasks. Perceptual activity and modality perception The perceptual activity and modality perception were assessed to show the importance of tactile activity as well as comparing vision with active touch and visual with auditory matching. Children‚Äôs drawings and the ‚ÄúGrammar of Action‚Äù Goodnow wanted to see how children could complete a drawing when they were given restriction. For example, she would give a child a circle with two dots ‚Äúeyes‚Äù low in the circle and asked them to complete the drawing. Grammar of Action was a tool that gave children simple figures and asked the children to draw them. The older the child was, the more creative their drawings were. Social policy and development issues Goodnow became interested in broader social issues, hence her books Children and Families in Australia and Women and Social Science and Public Policy. The first book discussed the problems of family life in the convict period to the modern problems facing Australia such as one-parent households, migrants, and violence against children. In this book she asked children about their family and school life and their friendships. Goodnow wanted to base the book on the perspective of children.  Honours and recognition  Goodnow was made a Companion of the Order of Australia in 1992 for \\"service to research into child development and education in the discipline of psychology\\". She was elected Fellow of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia in 1976.

The film was however cancelled. In the early 1920s the plans were revived and the project was given to Mauritz Stiller, who is credited as writer together with the Finnish-Swedish author Alma S√∂derhjelm. The screenplay differs from the original story in several regards, and the opening titles call it a \\"free adaptation\\" of the novel. Just like Stiller had done when he made his previous Lagerl√∂f adaptation, Sir Arne's Treasure, and Victor Sj√∂str√∂m had done with his, Stiller travelled to Lagerl√∂f and presented the screenplay to have it approved. Lagerl√∂f was however deeply dissatisfied with the liberties Stiller had taken, and the production company had to convince her to not denounce the film publicly. The film was produced through AB Svensk Filminspelning, a subsidiary of SF which only existed from 1922 to 1923. Lars Hanson was originally cast in the role of Gunnar Hede, but was replaced by Einar Hanson soon before production started. This was Einar Hanson's first leading role in a film. Principal photography took place between February and June 1922 in the Filmstaden studios. Exteriors were shot in the surrounding area, Nacka, and Kallsj√∂n in J√§mtland. Release The film premiered on 1 January 1923. The film was sold to 17 markets abroad, which was significantly fewer than Stiller's five previous films.

She was born in Taylorville, Illinois. Biography Robertson was a ground- breaking photographer who in 1939 was hired by The Peoria Evening Star newspaper as its first ‚Äúgirl photographer.‚Äù Three years later Robertson moved to Chicago and began working for Acme News Pictures, which later became United Press International. While working for Acme, Robertson co-founded an independent news service called Press Syndicate. Through this connection Robertson received photographic assignments which made her the first female photographer allowed onto the baseball infield at Wrigley Field in 1943, and the \\"only female photographer at the 1944 Democratic and Republican conventions.\\" Robertson had been a journalist during World War II and after she returned to her routine job at the New York Herald Tribune, felt that her \\"life lost its thrill.\\" In 1949, Robertson eagerly accepted an assignment to Venezuela. She became interested in Angel Falls and initially took aerial photographs. On April 23, 1949, she set out on an expedition to the base with the Latvian explorer Aleksandrs Laime to reach the falls. They traveled on the Chur√∫n River in dugout canoes and endured downpours of rain. On May 12, they finally reached the falls. The expedition was the first documented expedition, which included ten Kamarakoto natives (including another woman named Juanita), to reach the foot of the falls, and was also the first to measure them.

He announced his intention to run when he filed papers with the Federal Election Commission on July 1, 2011, and officially declared his candidacy the next day at a rock festival near Detroit. McCotter, who had served in Congress since 2003, was first mentioned as a potential presidential candidate on an April 2011 episode of Fox News' Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld. After entering the race two months later, McCotter based his campaign on \\"five core principles\\" listed on his campaign website, and used the slogan Seize Freedom!, derived from the title of his 2011 book. During the campaign, he focused on government reform and Wall Street. Commentators noted that McCotter's lack of name recognition hindered his chances for nomination. When included in Republican presidential preference polls, he regularly received less than one percent support. Following a last-place finish in the Ames Straw Poll and the lack of any invitation to presidential debates, he dropped his candidacy on September 22, 2011, and endorsed Mitt Romney. Thereafter, McCotter reportedly wrote a television pilot, which was released to the media prior to his resignation from Congress in July 2012 amid a fraud investigation surrounding his congressional re-election campaign. Background Thaddeus McCotter began his political career upon election to the Wayne County (Michigan) Commission in 1993. Five years later, he left that position after winning a seat in the Michigan State Senate. He remained there until 2002 when elected to serve Michigan's 11th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. Official Congressional photo of Thaddeus McCotter. In Congress, leadership assigned McCotter to the House Financial Services Committee. In addition, he joined the moderate Republican Main Street Partnership. In 2006, he attained the chairmanship of the House Republican Policy Committee, and two years later was named head of his party's Fiscal Integrity Task Force. On the task force, he gained a reputation as a leading opponent of pork barrel spending. He voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and the Affordable Health Care for America Act of 2010, but supported the bailout of the automobile industry in 2009. He also supported an increase in the minimum wage and advocated fair trade with China. Nevertheless, the Detroit Free Press described him as a \\"conservative's conservative\\" and GovTrack labeled him a \\"far-right Republican\\". McCotter was also known as an \\"oddball\\" in Congress, displaying a wry sense of humor. Betsy Woodruff of National Review identified him as \\"the strangest Congressman.\\" Showing a fondness for rock music, he played lead guitar in the Second Amendments. President George W. Bush referred to him as \\"that rock and roll dude.\\" Moreover, McCotter frequently appeared on Fox News' late night/early morning show Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld. Bloomberg Businessweek described his celebrity as a \\"tiny cult following of insomniac conservatives.\\" Campaign speculation McCotter addresses the alt=McCotter stands at a podium with his right arm bent at the elbow and facing up Speculation about a presidential run began several months after the release of his February 2011 book Seize Freedom! American Truths and Renewal in a Chaotic Age. The first instance occurred during the April 22 episode of Red Eye, where host Greg Gutfeld asked McCotter to enter the presidential race. Five days later, political commentator and fellow Red Eye frequenter S. E. Cupp listed McCotter as a potential candidate in her Daily News column. McCotter confirmed in May that he was seriously considering a run for the presidency. He told the newspaper Politico he felt most Republicans lacked enthusiasm for the current crop of candidates. Commentator Andrew Breitbart expressed excitement at the prospect of a McCotter run. Describing him as \\"blunt, sarcastic, pop-culture-savvy, constitutionally sound and an authentic voice,\\" Breitbart remarked no one I'd like to see more at a debate than McCotter.\\" In May 2011, speculation increased as McCotter attacked Republican frontrunner Mitt Romney as Romney visited Detroit. He connected Romney to President Barack Obama, arguing that people see Romney and Obama as running mates rather than as rivals. Later that month, he addressed the Republican Leadership Conference in New Orleans and entered the event's straw poll. Out of the cast, he received two, last place among those considered. At this time, McCotter remained undecided about a run, according to his aides, though he paid $18,000 for a prime spot at the August 13 Ames Straw Poll. During a visit to Iowa, the first caucus state, McCotter announced he would reveal his campaign plans prior to the straw poll. On June 30, Politico reported McCotter was ready to begin a campaign. Campaign developments Announcement McCotter plays guitar at his presidential announcement during the alt=McCotter on stage with a guitar beside a campaign poster McCotter filed a presidential campaign committee statement with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and opened a campaign website on July 1, 2011. The website, which warned \\"your American Dream is endangered\\" was based on his book Seize Freedom! and listed \\"five core principles\\".These were: #\\"Our liberty is from God not the government\\" #\\"Our sovereignty is in our souls not the soil\\" #\\"Our security is from strength not surrender\\" #\\"Our prosperity is from the private sector not the public sector\\" #\\"Our truths are self-evident not relative\\" McCotter officially announced his candidacy at the WAAM- sponsored \\"Freedom Festival\\" in Whitmore Lake, Michigan on July 2. He declared, \\"what we need in Washington is someone who understands that the wave of the future is not big government, but self-government\\". He played with his rock band at the event. Upon his entrance, Charlie Cook of The Cook Political Report rated McCotter's chances of nomination as \\"virtually impossible\\". CBS News and other outlets commented on McCotter's lack of name recognition and described him as a \\"little-known\\" candidate. Nevertheless, the Free Press noted he had about $480,000 available in his congressional account to transfer to his presidential campaign account. Political communications operative Mark Corallo was hired along with a core group of advisers that included former Senator Bill Frist's chief of staff Eric Uelind, and former Iowa representative Christopher Rants. Campaign events As McCotter embarked on his first official campaign trip to the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire, he received media attention for his hometown newspaper's reaction to his run. An editorial in The Oakland Press, based out of Oakland County, Michigan, wrote that the idea of a McCotter presidency \\"isn't a pleasant thought and is, in fact, a bit scary\\". It added, \\"the representative comes off as cold, arrogant and egotistical\\". Nevertheless, McCotter continued his campaign in New Hampshire, focusing on the \\"fundamental restructuring of government\\", and signing the Susan B. Anthony List's Pro-Life Leadership Pledge. Radio host Chris Buck was hired as leader of operations in New Hampshire. alt=S. E. Cupp McCotter returned to Iowa in mid-July for further campaign events. Around this time, Chris Cillizza of the Washington Post placed McCotter's odds of winning the Ames Straw Poll at one hundred to one, last place among the candidates listed. A Harris poll conducted found that of voters were not familiar with McCotter, and less than one percent supported him when matched against his fellow presidential contenders. In a hypothetical head to head matchup with President Obama, McCotter received , compared to for the President. To build support, McCotter used Twitter, with which he attempted to bypass the news media and connect directly with supporters. Campaign spokesman Randall Thompson stated that McCotter was \\"relying on social media...[and]...developed a very loyal following\\". McCotter participated in the first-ever Twitter presidential debate, on July 20, against fellow candidates former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson, businessman Herman Cain, representative Michele Bachmann, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, and former Senator Rick Santorum. At one point, moderator S. E. Cupp asked whether President Obama was anti-Israel, McCotter answered, \\"Obama's motivations are not the issue, the impact of his policies, both proposed and pursued, have strained our relationship\\" with Israel. When asked to comment on the U.S. role in the 2011 military intervention in Libya, McCotter referred to the Obama administration's mission as \\"ill-defined,\\" and argued for \\"no US boots on ground.\\" However, he added the caveat, \\"once committed [to the mission], we can't abruptly withdraw.\\" In late July, during the height of the debt ceiling crisis, McCotter canceled several appearances in Iowa and returned to Washington. He supported the plan of House Speaker John Boehner, and voted in favor of the compromise bill. He was the only presidential candidate in the House of Representatives to approve the bill in Congress since both fellow members Bachmann and Ron Paul voted against it. alt=McCotter Ahead of the Ames Straw Poll, McCotter had not reached the one percent polling threshold necessary to participate in the event's August 11 debate on Fox News. At the time, McCotter had little support, even at home. Public Policy Polling showed him with only five percent from Michigan Republicans, a figure pollsters described as rare coming from a candidate's home state. With news of his standing, McCotter cancelled a scheduled stop in New Hampshire, and returned to his headquarters in Michigan to coordinate a debate inclusion effort. As part of the effort, the campaign filmed a YouTube video in a kitchen, featuring McCotter making puns about food, and concluding with \\"Thanks, dude.\\" The Los Angeles Times described the video as \\"unfortunate\\". Despite the effort, McCotter did not meet the polling threshold and was excluded. He was the only candidate missing from the debate that had secured a spot on the ballot. Just before the vote the Ames, McCotter addressed voters in what Politico described as \\"a slow, abstract, exceptionally sober speech\\". It drew little crowd reaction other than applause at the denunciation of the \\"regime in Beijing\\" and the proclamation, \\"I will not cede the 21st Century to a Communist, nuclear-armed dictatorship.\\" At his tent, McCotter spent a large amount of time playing guitar. In the straw poll, he finished last among ten candidates, receiving or . Based on the $18,000 he paid for campaign space, the result corresponded to $514 per vote. Senior adviser Christopher Rants explained that the purpose of the straw poll \\"was not about votes, it was about introducing our candidate to the public in our first large forum... By any measure, we did that\\". McCotter campaigns at the alt=McCotter stands outside with a microphone before a podium and bale of hay facing a seated crowd Three days after the straw poll, McCotter wrote an article in National Review outlining some of his economic plans. He advocated spending reductions, a twenty percent reserve requirement for banks to keep available as capital, and incentives to reduce home foreclosures. He campaigned in New Hampshire on August 19, and filmed \\"Conversation with the Candidate\\" for . The next day, he attended a party with S. E. Cupp for the Young Republicans of Seacoast. He returned to Iowa for his last campaign stop in the state from August 24 to August 27. At the end of the month, McCotter appeared on the Dennis Miller Show and talked about his exclusion from debates. He failed to meet the requirements for both the September 7 MSNBC and the September 12 CNN debates. For the MSNBC debate, a candidate had to show one poll with four percent support. McCotter argued that while he did not meet this, in a Quinnipiac poll, he tied with Rick Santorum and Jon Huntsman Jr., both of whom qualified. Other candidates who did not qualify included Gary Johnson and former Louisiana governor Buddy Roemer, who like McCotter, did not qualify for any televised debates. McCotter continued his efforts to be included in the debates in September. On September 9, McCotter made his last campaign trip to New Hampshire, attending events for two days. He was supposed to appear in Iowa again five days later, but had to cancel due to a vote in Congress. While in Washington, he introduced a Grover Norquist-backed Social Security reform plan, which would have created private accounts for those under of age with limited guaranteed government benefits. He called on the other GOP presidential candidates to release their plans on Social Security. Shortly thereafter, McCotter participated in the California Republican Convention. In a speech there, he criticized President Obama, arguing, \\"No matter how many times his campaign clown car crisscrosses America, we know that the most prosperous and equitable economy in human history was created by you, the American people, not by bureaucrats in Washington.\\" At the event's straw poll, he received less than one percent of the vote. McCotter tried to gain entry into the September 22 Fox News debate, but reported via Twitter, has kindly advised me I will be excluded from the Orlando GOP POTUS debate.\\" Withdrawal On September 22, 2011, McCotter notified The Detroit News he would withdraw from the presidential race. He explained it \\"was sort of death by media\\" because of the exclusion from the presidential debates, and argued \\"if they keep you out of the debates, you are out of the conversation and you can't run.\\" He then released a statement in which he endorsed Mitt Romney for president, and called on the Republican Party to unite behind Romney as the most electable candidate. In the press release, McCotter also announced that he would run for re-election in his congressional district. In reporting on the withdrawal, the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"What's that? You've never heard of Thaddeus McCotter? Well, that's the main reason he's now a former candidate.\\" Pundit Bill Ballenger of Inside Michigan Politics said that McCotter \\"really had no business running for president. If he wants to have any political future, endorsing Mitt Romney now is the smart thing to do.\\" McCotter's neighbor, former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox, remarked, \\"He tried it out, obviously it wasn't working. And he's doing the rational thing and dropping out.\\" Steve Kornacki of Salon summarized the overall campaign as \\"a cautionary tale about what can go wrong when your average backbench member of Congress becomes a minor cable news celebrity and mistakes it for having a genuine national following.\\" Aftermath A few days after the campaign ended, The Detroit News asked McCotter whether he enjoyed his presidential campaign, he replied, \\"No. It was the worst of my life.\\" Fundraising totals for the three months of McCotter's run were released to the FEC in October 2011. Overall, he raised $548,606 ($468,561 of which was transferred from authorized committees), paid $541,532 on expenses, and had a debt of $105,367. As of June 2013, a debt of $105,636 remains. In an interview with GQ ahead of the Michigan primary in February 2012, McCotter expressed concern that Republicans were underestimating the strength of Democrats, and that winning in the Midwest would be difficult because of the Republicans' position on manufacturing and the Wall Street bailout. He maintained that though he disagreed with Romney on the auto industry bailout, Romney had the best chance to overcome the obstacles. Though McCotter had decided to run for reelection in his congressional district, he failed to qualify for his district's Republican primary after the majority of his petitions were declared fraudulent. An investigation of the campaign by the office of the Michigan Attorney General ensued. Steve Kornacki suggested the fraud may have been related to the presidential campaign, if it \\"caused him to take his eye off the ball on his House reelection,\\" but McCotter rejected this as an \\"idiotic line of thinking.\\" He initially hoped to wage a write-in campaign, but decided against it, finding he could not run the campaign while cooperating with the investigation and serving the remainder of his term in Congress. A month later, he resigned from Congress, claiming this was needed to fully assist with the petition fraud investigation. The investigation found that in addition to the 2012 petitions, McCotter's Congressional reelection petitions from 2006, 2008, and 2010, also showed evidence of fraud. McCotter sued two aides accusing them of intentional sabotage. Eventually, four aides, including one who was sued, were charged and convicted of violations related to the fraud. A day prior to his resignation from Congress, The Detroit News reported that after ending his presidential campaign, McCotter took to writing a television pilot he titled, \\"Bumper Sticker: Made On Motown\\". It centered on McCotter as the host of a variety show with characters based on his congressional staffers, who made fun of his presidential campaign and discussed such risqu√© topics as sex, race, and bodily functions. In one scene in the script, S. E. Cupp guest stars; McCotter tries to conduct a serious interview with her, but the other characters make sexually explicit comments, leading Cupp to describe the show as a \\"train wreck.\\" A former staffer released the work to the media to show what McCotter did while in office. In response, McCotter denied any wrongdoing, saying it had been largely composed in his garage as a way to get over his failed presidential campaign. He said the script was unfinished and had not authorized it for release, but decided to discuss it with The News. He cited comedian Martin Mull's short-lived 1977 show Fernwood 2 Night as an inspiration, and revealed that he had planned to leave Congress in 2014 and was preparing for a future career.

He settled at Birmingham, and soon acquired a large practice. Birmingham General Hospital was founded chiefly through his influence, and he was its first physician. While actively engaged in practice he became affected with temporary mental derangement, for which it is said he found a cure in the study of mathematics and botany. He was admitted a candidate of the Royal College of Physicians on 22 December 1786, and in the following year resigned his office in Birmingham and removed to London. He became fellow of the College of Physicians on 22 December 1787, and afterwards practised with success in London. He filled the offices of censor of the college in 1789 and 1793; was Harveian orator in 1790, Gulstonian lecturer in 1791, and Croonian lecturer in 1793. He died on 18 June 1798, and was buried in Kensington Church (since rebuilt). His portrait, by Sir Joshua Reynolds, once in the hospital at Birmingham, was acquired by Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery in 2012. It was engraved by Bartolozzi in 1791. In the picture, above his right elbow is the foundation block of the then medical school, on Holloway Head. This became part of the Accident Hospital, since redeveloped as apartments. He is also commemorated by a blue plaque, affixed to the House of Fraser store in Temple Row, Birmingham. Works Ash was a Fellow of the Royal Society, described as a physician of great skill, and of considerable other attainments. He founded the social and literary Eumelian Club. The name was a punning allusion to the ash tree (Greek or , i.e. with an ashen spear). It was referred to in James Boswell's Life of Johnson, in a note to the last chapter. He wrote: * Experiments and Observations to investigate by Chemical Analysis the properties of the Mineral Waters of Spa, Aix, London, 1788. * Oratio Harveiana, 1790.

Javadi and K. Burrill. AZERBAIJAN x. Azeri Turkish Literature:\\"It was in the 13th and 14th centuries that a stylized poetry began to develop, partly due to Eastern Turkic traditions brought from Khorasan during the Mongol occupation. An early example is a couple of verses of Turkish and Persian poetry attributed to the late-13th- century minor poet Sheikh  øEzz-al-Din EsfarƒÅ æini, known as ·∏§asano·∏°lu or Pur-e ·∏§asan (cf. Hey æat, 1979, p. 26).\\") was the founder of literature in Azerbaijani language. Hasanoglu hailed from Khorasan. He was Sufi sheikh Jamaladdin Ahmad Zakir's student. He wrote in Azerbaijani Turkic, and Persian under the Azerbaijani pseudonym \\"Izzeddin Hasanoglu\\" and Persian pseudonym \\"Pur-Hasan\\" (Hasan's son). The main theme of Hasanoglu's poetry was love. The tazkirist of the 15th century Dovletshah Samargandi noticed that Hasanoghlu had written his poems in Azerbaijani and Persian and they were well known in Turkey and Azerbaijan. Hassanoghlu‚Äôs famous gazelle in Azerbaijani language has reached to our time. This gazelle was included to the final part of Saadi‚Äôs ‚ÄúGulistan‚Äù, which was translated into Turkish language by Seyfi Sarayi in the 16th century in Egypt, and this fact saved ghazal from oblivion. German orientalist Barbara Flemming discovered one more ghazal of Hassanoghlu in Egypt. Evidently ‚ÄúDivan‚Äù by Hasanoghlu existed in the 16th century in Egypt. The works, created by the author in two languages, witness the mastery of the poet. According to poems it can be known that the poet was Sufi (scientific philosophical trend). It is impossible to differ poet's pantheistic love philosophy from love to concrete real person and a human being commonly. As many other pantheists, Hasanoghlu also welcomed earthly love, deified it, and exalted him to the Creator. It was a revolutionary approach to feudal ideology, the idea ‚Äúanalhag‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúGod is incide me‚Äù- brave defiance. Hasanoghlu lived in the late 13th century and the main feature of his creation was that he created it in his native language. Many generations of poets, who wrote in Turkic languages followed his lyric poetry. His followers are Ahmed Burhaneddin and Imadaddin Nasimi. {border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\" width=\\"50%\\" style=\\"background:#f6f6f6;\\" English Translation My mistress is a heartless flirt- O, woe is me!

Considerable effort was expended in the conversion of cavalrymen into footsoldiers trained and equipped for trench warfare. The battalion spent its entire existence on the Western Front as part of the 4th Infantry Division, arriving as the Battle of the Somme was ending in early December 1916.The Long, Long Trail The Household Battalion It fought in the Battle of Arras and later at Third Ypres, suffering severely in the assault on Poelcappelle. Its last major engagement was the defence of Bourlon Ridge during the Battle of Cambrai in late 1917.Squadron Corporal Major C W. Frearson Esq HOUSEHOLD BATTALION HISTORY - 1916 to 1918 By this time, it had become apparent that there were insufficient reserves to support all the Household Cavalry regiments that had been converted to infantry (in particular, the Guards Machine Gun Regiments) and it was disbanded as part of a general reorganization in February 1918. Men of the battalion were paid cavalry rates of pay (a little more than infantry) and wore cavalry uniforms while on leave. The battalion was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Wyndham Portal throughout the 14 months of its existence. Colours and battle honours The battalion did not receive any Colours during its short existence, but a King's Colour was made in 1919 and laid up in Holy Trinity Garrison Church, Windsor, in 1920. Colonel Portal decided that the battle honours to which the Household Battalion was entitledThese were Ypres 1917, Scarpe 1917, Broodseinde, Poelcappelle and Passchendaele. should be awarded jointly to the 1st Life Guards, 2nd Life Guards and the Royal Horse Guards, so the Household Battalion's colour carries no battle honours.

It was adapted from John B. Keane's 1965 play of the same name. The film is set in the early 1930s in County Kerry, although it was shot almost entirely in the Connemara village of Leenaun. Plot 'Bull' McCabe, an Irish farmer, dumps a dead donkey in a lake. It transpires that McCabe's son, Tadhg, killed the donkey after discovering it had broken into the field the family has rented for generations. The donkey's owner blames Bull McCabe for the death and demands \\"blood money\\". McCabe has a deep attachment to the rented field, which his family has cultivated and improved, from barren to now very productive, over a number of generations. The field's owner is a widow who, around the time of the 10th anniversary of the death of her husband, decides to sell the field. She decides to sell the field by public auction rather than to McCabe directly. Unknown to McCabe, Tadhg has been harassing the widow for years, causing her to believe that McCabe is behind the harassment in order to force her into a sale. On hearing there will be an auction McCabe goes to the village pub and announces that nobody would dare bid against him for \\"his\\" field. McCabe has constant doubts about Tadhg's ability to safeguard the field. His older son, Seamie, committed suicide when he was 13. McCabe blames himself for the death, as he told Seamie the field could only support one family, and that Tadhg would have to emigrate when he grew up. McCabe and his wife have not spoken in the 18 years since the death. Peter, an American whose ancestors are from the area, arrives in the village. He has plans to build a hydro-electric plant in the area and quarry stone for new roads. Central to his plans is McCabe's field. At the auction Peter repeatedly out-bids McCabe, forcing the price up to 80 pounds, 30 pounds more than what McCabe can afford. Seeing the bidding war the widow stops the auction and insists there would be a new auction, with a reserve price of 100 pounds. Knowing he cannot out bid Peter and seeing his cattle thrown off the field, McCabe goes to the rectory to confront Peter, and the parish priest who has been supporting him. McCabe now discovers Tadhg's actions, expelling him from the meeting, and goes on to explain his deep attachment to the field. This includes the death of his mother while saving hay. Peter refuses to back down from his plans. In a desperate last attempt McCabe and Tadhg confront Peter at a waterfall he has just purchased, the night before the second auction. When Tadhg fails to defeat Peter in a fight, McCabe himself intervenes and beats both men in a rage. Peter is killed, and upon realising this, McCabe has a mental break. He confuses Peter with his dead son Seamie. Tadhg flees to the Irish Traveller woman he has fallen for. He tells her he has killed Peter, and they make plans to run off together. McCabe's acolyte Bird O'Donnell bids on behalf of McCabe and secures the field for 101 pounds at the second auction, unopposed. A Traveller boy spots the dead donkey floating in the lake and a crane is brought in to recover it. It inadvertently recovers the corpse of Peter. At the same time Tadhg comes home to tell his father he is leaving with the Traveller's daughter and says he never wanted the field. The Parish priest arrives to confront McCabe about the discovery of Peter. Having lost his son and with the corpse discovered, McCabe goes insane and herds his cattle to the cliffs. Bird informs Tadhg that his father has gone mad. Tadhg rushes to stop his father but gets driven over the cliff by the herd of cattle and killed. Further maddened with grief, McCabe attempts to drive the waves back from his dead son, while Tadhg's mother and the Traveller's daughter sob on the clifftop.

For example with the role going to Sean McGinley, the role of the town priest was expanded, likewise the character of William Dee, an English resident in the town, was replaced by a sympathetic Irish American man named Peter, who was portrayed by Tom Berenger.

In 2007, GCI began a series of company acquisitions, including IVL India (for SAP Services)., Planet Asia, and Blue Hammock (for Strategic Consulting). In 2008, GCI changed its name to Collabera. In 2012, Collabera began a period of corporate expansion and reorganization as their IT services wing became a $100 million section of the company, which was by then worth $500 million overall. The company built a third development center (along with existing ones in Bangalore and Trivandrum) named \\"Collabera House\\" in Vadodara, India, with plans to open another in the country. The following year, Raj Mamodia was appointed as Collabera's new CEO. Then, in 2014, Collabera spun off its IT services wing into the subsidiary company Brillio, while Collabera retained its staffing service business. Raj Mamodia was transitioned to the role of CEO of Brillio, and Hiten Patel resumed his previous role as Collabera's CEO. On 1 July 2020, Collabera appointed its new CEO Karthik Krishnamurthy. In this position he succeeds Hiten Patel; Patel has transitioned to board member. YouTube content moderation The video sharing website YouTube has used Collabera as a contractor to hire content moderators, who review videos to determine if their content violates YouTube's content policies. A September 2020 lawsuit filed against YouTube included reports by a former Collabera employee who said that she was given little to no mental health training or support and made to sign an NDA before being shown examples of content that appears in the review queues. She reported being made to regularly exceed YouTube's stated limited of four hours per day of viewing graphic content.

He was found dead in May 2008, a crime for which actress Maria Susairaj and her boyfriend Lieutenant Emile Jerome Mathew were arrested. Mathew was eventually found guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and for destroying evidence. Susairaj was acquitted of the killing itself, but found guilty of destroying evidence. The killing and subsequent trial received significant press coverage in India. Background Maria Susairaj was a new and small-time South Indian film actress and Lieutenant Emil Jerome Mathew was her boyfriend. Both were said to be getting engaged two months later. Neeraj Grover was helping Susairaj to establish a foothold in the television industry and had also arranged few auditions for her. Susairaj had once told Mathew that Grover had a crush on her but she did not reciprocate. She had reportedly also stayed at Grover's apartment for a few days. At the time of the incident, Susairaj was moving into her new rented apartment and Grover was helping her with the move. On 6 May 2008, Grover reportedly went to meet Susairaj and was never found again. When his friends and family could not trace him for over 24 hours, his family filed a missing person's report. Grover's family told police that they suspected the involvement of his female friend in his disappearance. Susairaj, when questioned by police claimed that though Grover had met her on Tuesday night, he left at 12 A.M. to meet some friends for a party in Andheri. As per various media reports, and as stated by the police, Susairaj continued fabricating stories for 10 days, until she eventually told the police that Mathew had killed Grover in her presence. Killing and immediate aftermath Grover visited Susairaj's Malad apartment Dhiraj Solitaire at 22:00 on 6 May to help her settle in. At the same time, Mathew called her up and got upset to hear a male voice in background. When Susairaj told Mathew that Grover had come over to help her, Jerome asked Maria not to allow Neeraj to stay overnight. Mathew at that time was living in Kochi. However, he took a flight and came to Mumbai the next day without telling Susairaj. He reached her apartment at 07:30. Susairaj opened the door and Mathew went straight into the bedroom to find Grover in the room. As per media and police reports, the two men had argument and then engaged in a physical fight. Mathew grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed Grover, who died on the spot. On 25 May, the crime branch recovered a nine-inch knife from Susairaj's apartment complex. Police believed that the knife was used to kill Grover. Around 11:00 am the same day, Susairaj went to a nearby mall and purchased bags, air freshener, curtains, bed sheets & knife. She later told police that she did this on Jerome's instructions. They both then took the dead body to the kitchen and chopped it into several pieces, stuffing them into the bags Susairaj had earlier bought. While many media outlets reported that Grover's body had been chopped into 300 pieces, the judge in the case would later state that this was \\"...far from the facts on record\\", and that such a description had caused \\"confusion\\" and had \\"outraged the general public\\". Susairaj borrowed a car from her friend and dumped the bags in the vehicle's boot whilst the building security guard watched them load the car. At 16:30 the same day, they drove towards Manor after buying two bottles of Petrol at Bhayander. They soaked the bags in petrol and set it on fire in a jungle near Amgaon village in Manor. After burning the dead body, they returned to Mumbai the same night at 21:30. Leads to prime suspects Some circumstances leading police to arrest Mathew and Susairaj included the following: Accidentally answering a call Maria Susairaj, along with Jerome Mathew, on her way to Manor in a friend's borrowed car (to dispose of Grover's body) accidentally answered a call on Grover's mobile while she was pulling it out of her denim pocket to see who the caller was. She had kept Grover's mobile with her after the murder. Although she immediately disconnected the call, police were able to trace the location at which the call was answered. This turned out to be a key lead for police as Susairaj, during questioning before her arrest, had told the police that she was shopping in Dadar when she was actually on her way to Manor. Lying about borrowed car Susairaj had initially told police that she borrowed a Santro car from Mathew's friend \\"Jitesh\\" for going out shopping. Jitesh was a Colaba- based Naval Officer and was at sea at the time of the incident. Susairaj requested Jitesh to stand by her if the police questioned him. It was stated that Jitesh refused to lie as his travel records would prove otherwise. Susairaj then admitted to the police that she lied for personal reasons and it was then she revealed the true name of the car owner: Kiran Shreyas. Shreyas told the police that Susairaj had borrowed the car saying she wanted to go to Dadar for shopping with Mathew Police later brought the car, car owner & witnesses to the police station where Susairaj broke down and gave her version of the crime, up to and including the disposal of the body. Answering a friend's call One of Grover's friends called up on his mobile and Susairaj answered the call. She mumbled that Neeraj had \\"gone out\\" forgetting his cell phone with her. The friend later came and picked up the cell phone a couple of days later. This act of Susairaj also made her a prime suspect. 1,000 calls in 13 Days Crime branch found out that Mathew had called Susairaj nearly 1,000 times between 7 and 20 May 2008. The Crime Branch got suspicious and questioned Susairaj. Investigation Lapses Weapon The knife, which was thrown into a garbage chute, was not recovered for several days despite police searching the house several times. However, they had earlier sent a couple of seized knives for forensic tests to look for DNA samples. The tests turned out to be negative. Naval Training On 8 May 2008, Mathew was called for questioning by the Malad police. He told them he had come to Mumbai for a Naval training session. The police did not verify his claim with the naval authorities. Bloodstains ignored Mathew and Susairaj had repainted a wall to hide the bloodstains. Malad police did not ask them why one wall was coloured differently from the rest. The verdict Maria Monica Susairaj was found not guilty of the killing, but guilty of destroying evidence and was sentenced to a maximum three years' imprisonment. She was released the following day with time served. Jerome Mathew was found guilty of culpable homicide not amounting murder and of destroying evidence. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the killing, and 3 years for destroying evidence. The sentences will be served concurrently, with 3 years time served already applied. The court has also fined Susairaj and Mathew 50,000, to be paid to Neeraj Grover's family. Judge's observations while dictating verdict Aftermath Various outlets of the national press of India reported public outrage on what was considered a light verdict given the accused had chopped the body into hundreds of pieces after murder. In News channel NDTV decried the defamation of the accused, claiming they were under lot of stress. The national news outlets wrote particularly scathing indictments of the actress following the verdict. Times Now called her the \\"Lady Macbeth of the Grover case ... (who) has gone an extreme length to feed her ambition even if it means putting her jilted lover in the dock and moreover taking the life of an innocent.\\" Attorneys for both the convicted parties as well as the prosecution announced their intentions to file appeals. Depiction in film Well known Indian Bollywood director Ram Gopal Verma has made a movie named Not a Love Story based upon this case.

The battle ended any hope for the survival of the Treaty of 1752 signed by Governor Hobson and chief Jean-Baptiste Cope. Historical context Despite the British Conquest of Acadia in 1710, Nova Scotia remained primarily occupied by Catholic Acadians and Mi'kmaq. By the time Cornwallis had arrived in Halifax, there was a long history of the Wabanaki Confederacy (which included the Mi'kmaq) protecting their land by killing British civilians along the New England/ Acadia border in Maine (See the Northeast Coast Campaigns 1688, 1703, 1723, 1724, 1745, 1746, 1747).Grenier, John. The Far Reaches of Empire. War in Nova Scotia, 1710-1760. University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, 2008. To prevent the establishment of Protestant settlements in the region, Mi'kmaq raided the early British settlements of present-day Shelburne (1715) and Canso (1720). A generation later, Father Le Loutre's War began when Edward Cornwallis arrived to establish Halifax with 13 transports on June 21, 1749.Grenier, John. The Far Reaches of Empire. War in Nova Scotia, 1710-1760. Norman: U of Oklahoma P, 2008; Thomas Beamish Akins. History of Halifax, Brookhouse Press. 1895. (2002 edition). p 7 The British quickly began to build other settlements. To guard against Mi'kmaq, Acadian and French attacks on the new Protestant settlements, British fortifications were erected in Halifax (1749), Bedford (Fort Sackville) (1749), Dartmouth (1750), Lunenburg (1753) and Lawrencetown (1754).John Grenier. The Far Reaches of Empire: War in Nova Scotia, 1710-1760. Oklahoma University Press. There were numerous Mi'kmaq and Acadian raids on these villages such as the Raid on Dartmouth (1751).Grenier pp. 154‚Äì155. For the Raids on Dartmouth see the Diary of John Salusbury (diarist): Expeditions of Honour: The Journal of John Salusbury in Halifax; also see A genuine narrative of the transactions in Nova Scotia since the settlement, June 1749, till August the 5th, 1751 [microform] : in which the nature, soil, and produce of the country are related, with the particular attempts of the Indians to disturb the colony / by John Wilson. Also see http://www.blupete.com/Hist/NovaScotiaBk1/Part5/Ch07.htm After the Raid on Dartmouth (1749), Governor Edward Cornwallis offered a bounty on the head of every Mi'kmaq. The British military paid the Rangers the same rate per scalp as the French military paid the Mi'kmaq for British scalps.Thomas Akins. History of Halifax, Brookhouse Press. 1895. (2002 edition). p 19 After eighteen months of inconclusive fighting, uncertainties and second thoughts began to disturb both the Mi'kmaq and the British communities. By the summer of 1751 Governor Cornwallis began a more conciliatory policy. On 16 February 1752, hoping to lay the groundwork for a peace treaty, Cornwallis repealed his 1749 scalp proclamation against the Wabanaki Confederacy.Patterson, p. 134 For more than a year, Cornwallis sought out Mi'kmaq leaders willing to negotiate a peace. He eventually gave up, resigned his commission and left the colony.Plank, 1996, p.34 With a new Governor in place, Governor Peregrine Thomas Hopson, the first willing Mi'kmaq negotiator was Cope. On 22 November 1752, Cope finished negotiating a peace for the Mi'kmaq at Shubenacadie. The basis of the treaty was the one signed in Boston which closed Dummer's War (1725). Cope tried to get other Mi'kmaq chiefs in Nova Scotia to agree to the treaty but was unsuccessful. The Governor became suspicious of Cope's actual leadership among the Mi'kmaq people.Plank, 2001, p.135 Of course, Le Loutre and the French were outraged at Cope's decision to negotiate at all with the British. Battle According to Charles Morris's account, John Connor and three others on abroad the Schooner Dunk from Canso, Nova Scotia put into Jeddore and stole the Mi'kmaq stores, 40 barrels of provisions given them by the Governor. At present-day Country harbour on 21 February 1753, nine Mi'kmaq from present day Antigonish (Nartigouneche) captured John Connor and the three other crew members James Grace, Michael Haggarthy and John Power. The Mi'kmaq fired on them and drove them toward the shore. Other natives joined in and boarded the schooner, forcing them to run their vessel into an inlet. The Mi'kmaq scalped two of the British crew, Haggarthy and Power.Halifax Gazette 28 April 1753 The Mi'kmaq took Connor and Grace captive for seven weeks. After seven weeks in captivity, on April 8, the two British men killed a Mi'kmaw woman and child and then four other Mi'kmaw men. Afterward, they managed their escape.Diary of Anthony Casteel; Atkins. Public Documents, pp. 694‚Äì695Diary of Anthony Casteel In contrast, according to Anthony Casteel, after stealing provisions from the Mi'kmaq at Jeddore, the English schooner accidentally was shipwrecked and two of the four crew members drowned.Diary of Anthony Casteel, p. 118 The two British survivors, despite the Mi'kmaw hospitality shown them, killed seven Mi'kmaq: two men, three women, one child and one infant. In response, Mi'kmaq were reported to have gone to Halifax to complain about how to keep their provisions safe during fishing season.Account by Joseph Morrice in the Diary of Anthony Casteel, p. 118 A French officer at Louisbourg did not believe this account of events.; If Connor and Grace were only motivated by scalp money as Casteel asserted, it is unclear who would have paid them for Mi'kmaw scalps given Governor Cornwallis ended the bounty for Mi'kmaw prisoners and scalps the previous year. Aftermath In response, on the night of April 21, under the leadership of Jean-Baptiste Cope, the Mi'kmaq attacked an English schooner at Jeddore. There were nine English men and one Acadian, Anthony Casteel, who was the British interpreter. The Mi'kmaq killed the English and let Anthony Casteel free at Port Toulouse, where the Mi'kmaq sank the schooner after looting it.; Cope's peace treaty was ultimately rejected by most of the other Mi'kmaq leaders. Cope burned the treaty six months after he signed it. Despite the collapse of peace on the eastern shore, the British did not formally renounce the Treaty of 1752 until 1756.

L-packets were introduced by Robert Langlands in , . The classification of irreducible representations splits into two parts: first classify the L-packets, then classify the representations in each L-packet. The local Langlands conjectures state (roughly) that the L-packets of a reductive group G over a local field F are conjecturally parameterized by certain homomorphisms of the Langlands group of F to the L-group of G, and Arthur has given a conjectural description of the representations in a given L-packet. The elements of an L-packet For irreducible representations of connected complex reductive groups, Wallach proved that all the L-packets contain just one representation. The L-packets, and therefore the irreducible representations, correspond to quasicharacters of a Cartan subgroup, up to conjugacy under the Weyl group. For general linear groups over local fields, the L-packets have just one representation in them (up to isomorphism). An example of an L-packet is the set of discrete series representations with a given infinitesimal character and given central character. For example, the discrete series representations of SL2(R) are grouped into L-packets with two elements. gave a conjectural parameterization of the elements of an L-packet in terms of the connected components of C/Z, where Z is the center of the L-group, and C is the centralizer in the L-group of Im(œÜ), and œÜ is the homomorphism of the Langlands group to the L-group corresponding to the L-packet. For example, in the general linear group, the centralizer of any subset is Zariski connected, so the L-packets for the general linear group all have 1 element. On the other hand, the centralizer of a subset of the projective general linear group can have more than 1 component, corresponding to the fact that L-packets for the special linear group can have more than 1 element.

It was shortlisted for the 2003 Whitbread First Novel Award and for the 2003 Kerry Group Irish Fiction Award. Synopsis An Evening of Long Goodbyes is about a 24-year-old wealthy layabout who prefers to watch Gene Tierney movies in his chaise longue, with a gimlet in hand, rather than go out and find a job. Charles Hythloday is a Trinity College dropout living with his sister, Christabel (\\"Bel\\"), in their parents' mansion, Amaurot (named after the capital city of More's Utopia). There are only two things that Charles loves more than the film actress, Gene Tierney; his home and his struggling actress sister. While Charles loves his childhood home, Bel notices it makes people become phony, and wants out of the mansion. Charles argues that his time is well spent building a folly in the back garden and perfecting sprezzatura, the art of acting like a gentleman while making it appear like one is doing nothing at all. Charles dreams of a return to a time when men wear top coats and women have white gloves. But the fantasy ends when the bills pile up and the bank threatens to repossess the house. Charles devises a plan to blow up the folly, fake his death, use the insurance money to save Amaurot and move to South America. His plans go awry when he finds out that his Bosnian maid, Mrs P, has her children living in the folly. The folly explodes and a large stone gargoyle falls on Charles's head, putting him into a coma for a few weeks. He dreams of living in Chile with W. B. Yeats, where they spend their time perfecting sprezzatura, drinking gimlets, wearing sombreros, and tending the vineyard. Eventually, Charles is forced to work in a Latvian factory. In his spare time, Charles pens a play entitled There's Bosnians in my Attic! A Tragedy in Five Acts. The Latvian factory suddenly upgrades and swindles its employees out of their wages, leaving Charlie and hundreds of immigrants jobless. In order to make some fast cash, Charles lays down all his winnings on the local underdog, An Evening of Long Goodbyes, who narrowly wins the race despite being severely injured in the process. Affected by the little dog's plight, Charles decides to give him to Bel to smooth their rift. Charles is shocked to learn that Bel is planning a trip to Chekhov's home town in Russia to study The Cherry Orchard, her favorite play. The next morning, however, Bel drives her car into a wall at full speed, smashing through the windshield and flying into the sea. The circumstances surrounding her death are strange and mysterious, and life for everyone in the house falls into disarray. Charles takes a night job, sweeping the floor of a factory. He has begun writing a novel describing his fall from wealth, and that he likes his new life, in a way. One night, he finds Bel's mobile phone and receives a mysterious call from her. She says that she might come back to him one day, and Charles ends his story walking out into his decayed Ireland, bleakly anticipating her return. Reception The book has received good reviews. Stephen Amidon in The New York Times wrote that Murray \\"writes with the cunning and confidence of a seasoned pro\\", and that \\"the novel achieves an unexpected poignancy\\". A reviewer for RT√â described the book as \\"cleverly written\\". Film adaptation A film adaptation, with a script by Kieran Carney, was in development during 2012 by Subotica Films.

It was developed in Canada during the 1970s and made its way to Australia in 1981. The sport uses a volleyball for the ball and combines elements of basketball, soccer and ice hockey. The game is played on a basketball sized court.Depauw, K. P., & Gavron, S. J. (2005). Disability sport. (p. 152) Lower Mitcham, South Australia: Human Kinetics Publishers. Each team has four players on the court at any one time. It has drawn large crowds at events such as the Paralympics. Athlete classifications Wheelchair Rugby is open to athletes with quadriplegia. Athletes competing in wheelchair rugby are classified according to their ability. Players are classified using a points system starting at 0.5 for athletes with the least ability through to 3.5 for athletes with the most ability.

Tolerance to infections is defined as the ability of a host to limit the impact of parasites, pathogens or herbivores on host health, performance, and ultimately on fitness. Tolerance is not equivalent to resistance. Disease resistance is the host trait that prevents infection or reduces the number of pathogens, parasites and herbivores within or on a host. Tolerance to infections can be illustrated as the reaction of host performance along with increasing pathogen, parasite or herbivore load. This is a reaction norm in which host performance (on y-axis) is regressed against an increasing pathogen, parasite or herbivore burden (on x-axis).SIMMS, E. L., 2000. Defining tolerance as a norm of reaction. Evolutionary Ecology 14: 563-570. The slope of the reaction norm defines the degree of tolerance. High tolerance is indicated as a flat slope, i.e., host performance is not influenced by increasing number of pathogens, parasites or herbivores. Steep downward slope indicates low tolerance; host performance is strongly reduced with increasing pathogen burden. An upward slope indicates overcompensation; a host can increase its performance with increasing pathogen burden.

A passenger train was derailed close to a ravine, and seconds later a second train crashed into it. With 42 killed and 76 injured, it is the fourth highest death toll in the history of the Italian railways, after the Balvano, Fiumarella and Voghera disasters. While the official count of the injured is 76, the actual number of injured is often said to be from 117 to more than 120. Derailment and crash FS Class E.636.002, the same class as engine n.282, damaged in the accident The accident, also known as 'Freccia della Laguna train disaster', occurred between Express passenger train '572 bis', travelling northbound to Bologna, and Rapido (equivalent to an actual Intercity) train 813 'Freccia della Laguna', travelling southbound to Florence. Passenger train \\"572 bis\\" wasn't a train normally travelling on the Firenze-Bologna route. Coming from Bari, Apulia Region, and being headed towards Trieste, Friuli-Venezia Giulia Region, its normal route was the Adriatic one (Bari-Foggia-Pescara-Ancona-Bologna), thus normally not travelling between Florence and Bologna. At that time, nonetheless, an intense bad weather was hitting almost the whole Italian peninsula, and this caused a bridge along the Adriatic route to be heavily damaged by a seastrike. Therefore, all traffic normally running along that route (obviuosly including the '572 bis' express train) was diverted via Caserta, Rome and Florence. Express train '572 bis', pulled by two engines (FS Class E.645.016 and FS Class E.636.282), was traveling along the Direttissima (Florence‚ÄìRome high- speed railway) line between Florence and Bologna when, shortly after noon, it was derailed to the right by a small landslide that fell onto the rails, due to the heavy rain underway. In that section, the railway track was laid metres from a ravine along the A1 motorway but the first engine (E.645.016) fortunately stopped shortly before falling: up to that point, no major injuries had been caused by the accident, but the derailed E.645.016 was now askew, occupying both tracks of the railway line. The \\"Rapido 813\\", nicknamed \\"Freccia della Laguna\\", coming from Bolzano and heading to Rome was running on the opposite track: the train was made up of two FS Class ALe 601 units, 051 and 067, along with FS Class Le 480.010 and FS Class Le 601.024 coaches. The Freccia della Laguna was on a rapid service, thus traveling at medium-high speed (about 110 km/h), when it hit the derailed engine, still askew on both tracks and balanced on the border of the ravine. There was no chance for the driver of the incoming train to see the derailed engine because this one stopped shortly before the entrance of a tunnel. The crash forced the first four cars of Rapido 813 into the gorge: the two engines from 572 bis were lifted from their bogies, the bodies being crushed, falling to one side and coming to rest one above the other, with E.645 on top. Nobody on board the 572 bis express train was injured in the accident, except for the two drivers, who were both killed because they no time to escape the driving cabin. Among the passengers of the Rapido 813 were the Verona soccer team, who was travelling to Rome for a scheduled soccer match. At the time of the accident they were in the restaurant car, one of the less damaged cars, and so escaped the disaster almost unscathed. They took the train because the flight they booked had been canceled for bad weather conditions. Their assigned seats were in the first car of the Rapido 813, but they had the luck to be called to the restaurant car for the first lunch shift; other passengers sitting in the fore carriages, scheduled to be called for the second shift, were mostly killed or heavily injured. First response coordination The Murazze di Vado disaster was the first large scale rescue operation managed by CePIS (Centrale per il coordinamento Per Il Soccorso, Central for coordination of Rescue Operations), a public organization founded after the 1974 Italicus Express bombing to provide better first aid in emergencies and improve coordination of local response services on a regional scale. CePIS was instrumental in creating the first unified emergency number in Italy, setting up the first centralized regional emergency management center, and joining the many hospitals and private ambulance crews under a single directorate. The coordination of the rescue services was widely praised for their efficiency in the Murazze di Vado disaster. Coordination between police forces, crews and rescue vehicles allowed for speedy evacuation of the injured to Bologna's Ospedale Maggiore, unprecedented in the country and replicated a few years later in the Bologna Massacre of 1980. CePIS later became the instigator of Italy's 118 unified emergency number created in the wake of 1990 FIFA World Cup, phased out in 2011 in favor of the 112 European unified number. The initial rescues were brought on the disaster scene by car and truck drivers who were travelling along the A1 Motorway, which in that section is running meters aside the railway line. Aftermath E.645.016 was demolished after the disaster, along with the full ALe 601-Le 480 trainset. E.636.282 was rebuilt and put back into service. After the disaster the Rapido 813 was renamed as Marco Polo.

Feroe Building and the Stewart Building, is an historic two-story commercial building located at 73 S.W. Flagler Avenue, corner of S.W. St. Lucie Avenue in Stuart, Martin County, Florida. To its north of along Flagler Avenue is Fellowship Hall built in 1912 as the Bank of Stuart, while to the east along Flagler Avenue is the Lyric Theatre built in 1925 and later expanded. Built and named for Harry C. Feroe, who was associated with Charles C. Chillingworth in the development of Palm City, it was built in 1913 by local contractor Sam Matthews using locally manufactured concrete blocks which had been cast by Frank Frazier to look like stones. The ground floor, which fronted on St. Lucie Avenue and featured cast- iron columns, was designed for retail use, while the second floor, which was accessed by stairs from an entrance on the Flagler Avenue side of the building, was designed for office space. Later in 1913 the Florida East Coast Railway built its now demolished Stuart Depot directly across Flagler Avenue from the building, which enhanced its value. Early ground floor tenants were the Stuart post office in the corner space and the Stuart Drug Company to its north. After the post office moved out, its space was occupied by various other businesses until eventually being combined with the drug store space. Marilyn's Pharmacy, a Rexall agency, occupied the space in the 1960s and early 1970s. In the middle 1980s local lawyer Larry M. Stewart brought the building and renovated it for his law offices. The main entrance was moved to the east side of the building with access from a courtyard which is entered from Flagler Avenue through an arched wrought-iron gate.

Career Hoare was described as by The Guardian's Nick Davies as \\"coming from a working-class background of solid Arsenal supporters, always voted Labour, defined himself specifically as a 'clause IV' socialist who still believed in public ownership of the means of production.\\" Hoare was a trainee reporter in the 1980s for the Watford Observer. He was a reporter for The Sun before joining The Sunday People, under editor Neil Wallis. He moved to the News of the World in June 2001,The Guardian, 5 June 2001, NoW's Taylor promoted to Mr Fixit under editor Rebekah Brooks (then Rebekah Wade) but was sacked in 2005 by then editor Andy Coulson for drink and drug problems.

Hoare had once been a close friend of Coulson. Following his statements for The New York Times Hoare was interviewed by Scotland Yard officers \\"under criminal caution,\\" meaning that his statements could be used against him in possible future prosecution. Hoare had said of the phone hacking at the News of the World: \\"It was always done in the language of, 'Why don't you practise some of your dark arts on this', which was a metaphor for saying, 'Go and hack into a phone'. Such was the culture of intimidation and bullying that you would do it because you had to produce results. And, you know, to stand up in front of a Commons committee and say, 'I was unaware of this under my watch' was wrong.\\" Following his original statements for The New York Times and testimony before the police, Hoare re-entered the news in July 2011 when he and an anonymous colleague told reporters for the Times that British police had assisted reporters working for News of the World with cell- phone tracking, a power ordinarily used \\"for high-profile criminal cases and terrorism investigations,\\" in exchange for bribes.Burns, John F. and Jo Becker, \\"Murdoch Tabloids' Targets Included Downing Street and the Crown,\\" The New York Times, 11 July 2011, .

Hoare failed to return phone calls to his home in the week after his dinner with New York Times reporters. He was found dead at his home in Langley Road, Watford, Hertfordshire, at around 11 am on 18 July 2011. On the same day and within hours of his body being found, Hertfordshire Police stated that his death was \\"unexplained\\" but not suspicious, and that it could take weeks to establish a cause of death. On 21 July, Hoare's widow issued a statement in which she said that his death had come as a \\"tremendous shock\\". According to an inquest into his death, alcoholism resulting from media interest in the phone hacking scandal caused irreversible damage to Hoare's liver.

Bluefin‚Äôs technology platform, grounded in 15 years of cognitive science and machine learning research at the MIT Media Lab, semantically interprets people‚Äôs social media comments and automatically links them with the TV shows and ads they‚Äôre watching. Bluefin's flagship product offering, Bluefin Signals, is a tool for accessing, interpreting, and analyzing this social TV data. A data visualization from the TV Genome  History  A data visualization from the TV Genome Bluefin Labs was founded by Deb Roy and Michael Fleischman in 2008. The seed for the company originated within the MIT Media Lab‚Äôs Human Speechome Project (HSP). Headed by Roy, head of the Media Lab‚Äôs Cognitive Machines group, the goal of HSP was to understand language acquisition by making a complete digital record of the first years of a child‚Äôs home life and analyzing that record computationally. Roy and his wife installed video equipment throughout their home and captured much of their son‚Äôs life from birth to age three - a total of 240,000 hours of audio and video. Buried in this massive corpus lay insights into how their son learned language at a level of detail never before captured. To sift through the data, Roy and his MIT team developed numerous deep machine learning algorithms designed to uncover the context and patterns within the audio and video data. Their results are explained in Deb Roy's TEDTalk 'The birth of a word.' As a student in Roy‚Äôs MIT group, Fleischman adapted the concepts of data driven designed for language acquisition and applied them to another massive video data set: broadcast video. Fleischman‚Äôs PhD work garnered the attention of the National Science Foundation which awarded Roy and Fleischman a Small Business Innovation Research grant and effectively bootstrapped the launch of Bluefin. Just as HSP created algorithms that can ‚Äúground‚Äù the meaning of a word within a larger context, Bluefin is using deep machine learning to ground the meaning of a given comment pulled out from a social media stream. By looking at the context of words expressed by individuals, Bluefin can use the meaning of these words to connect comments back to the events, people, places, products, and brands that caused those words to be expressed in the first place. On July 32, 2012, Bluefin Labs announced that advertising industry veteran JP Maheu will join the company as CEO. On February 6, 2013, Twitter announced that it was buying Bluefin Labs for approximately $100 million.  Technology  Bluefin Labs uses proprietary algorithms to match social media comments to televised content. The methodology of associating comments to TV is composed of three parts: temporal analysis (looking at when a comment is posted), semantic analysis (matching written comments to what‚Äôs on TV), and machine learning (the ongoing process of training and re-training the matching algorithm). Bluefin also employs a proprietary algorithm for sentiment and gender analysis of the social media comments. The resulting data set is a large network of cause-effect links that measures people's engagement with TV, effectively creating a viewer/programmer feedback loop. This network is designed to provide marketers and media companies with insights that could be used for more efficient ad targeting and more informed content and creative development. Bluefin calls this mapping of social media commentary back to its televised stimulus the \\"TV Genome\\" ‚Äì a highly complex endeavor that, like the Human Genome Project, requires immense computational resources along with deep-rooted techniques in cognitive science and machine learning. Bluefin has a view into more than 5 billion public-facing social media comments each month, tied to a continuously growing video fingerprint archive of more than one million distinct airings of TV shows and commercials. Bluefin currently ingests and performs video fingerprinting of 115 U.S. TV broadcast and cable networks.  Products  Bluefin Signals is a social TV analytics suite that measures and organizes the conversations about TV that take place in social media. It is a SaaS analytics platform and is available to Brands, Agencies, and TV Networks on a subscription basis. Bluefin Signals is being used in various areas of the TV advertising ecosystem, including: research and audience insights, media planning and buying, TV ads sales negotiations, and TV ad creative development and optimization. Bluefin Signals processes an Electronic Programming Guide (EPG) feed as well as TV closed captioning to ensure accurate telecast-level analytics for social TV conversations. Bluefin Signals Network Edition is used by over 40 of the top broadcast and cable TV networks in the United States. Bluefin Signals Brand Edition is the first social TV analytics product built for brands.  Board and investors  Early in Bluefin‚Äôs development, Roy and Fleischman joined with technology entrepreneur Frank Moss (former MIT Media Lab Director, former CEO of Tivoli Systems) and media entrepreneur Brian Bedol (managing partner of Bedrock Venture Partners and founder and former CEO, ESPN Classic and CBS College Sports) to transition the company from research prototypes to a scalable technology platform tuned to the needs of the media industry. Bluefin Labs received initial Series A funding by Redpoint Ventures, one of the world's top venture capital firms whose investments include: TiVO, Netflix, MySpace, Excite, Juniper, and Right Media. In January 2012, Bluefin announced it had raised $12 million in a Series B round led by Time Warner Investments with participation from new investor SoftBank Capital and return investors Redpoint Ventures and Lerer Ventures. Alongside Redpoint, top executives from the worlds of technology, media, entertainment, and sports have invested in Bluefin. In addition to Bedol, notable angel investors include Jim Pallotta (Raptor Capital Management); co-owner, Boston Celtics), Jonathan Kraft (President, Kraft Group and New England Patriots), Dan Gilbert (founder and chairman, Quicken Loans; majority owner, Cleveland Cavaliers), Kenneth Lerer (Lerer Ventures, co-founder Huffington Post), Jeff Samberg (Acadia Woods), John Fogelman (Board Member, William Morris Endeavor). In its transition from pure academic research at the MIT Media Lab to private startup, Bluefin received funding from the National Science Foundation's Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant.  Partnerships and awards  Partnerships *In December 2011, Bluefin Labs and Starcom MediaVest Group (SMG) announced a partnership that enables SMG to make more informed media planning and buying decisions for its clients through the use of Bluefin Signals. *In February 2012, Bluefin Labs and ABC News announced a collaboration for coverage of key nights in the 2012 presidential campaign including on-air use of social media insights, analytics and data visualizations during ABC News broadcasts of Super Tuesday, the presidential and vice presidential debates, the Republican and Democratic conventions, Election Night and the inauguration.

Main characters Ethan Ethan Morgan (portrayed by Matthew Knight) is a geeky sci-fi- loving 15-year-old who discovers that his little sister's babysitter Sarah, is a vampire. Awkward, sweet and well-meaning, Ethan just wants to have a normal high school experience. But the constant paranormal chaos of Whitechapel make that nearly impossible. Ethan is a Seer. Seers are able to see visions through touch. His visions help him learn more about supernatural forces. Ethan lacks social skills because of which he usually finds himself lost when it comes to navigating social waters. Ethan is understood most by Benny, whom he has been best friends with since childhood. He loves playing video games and is book- smart. He is more sarcastic than Benny and thinks things through carefully. He cares for his loved ones and will go to any height to protect them. He is in the chess club along with Benny. Although Benny often gets the two of them into sticky situations, Ethan is usually able to find a way out. His biggest fear is being alone. Later on Ethan begins to develop a romantic relationship with best friend and supernatural partner Sarah in the two part Season 2 finale, \\"The Date to End All Dates.\\" In Season 2 (The Date To End all Dates Part 2) Benny's grandmother tries to help out Ethan get over his fear in seeing dead people, but then that does not work so when he holds Benny's and Sarah's hand he sees them normal again. But then he has to bring back our loyal friend Jesse, so then they have to go to this old building and defeat the bad guy by Jesse joining their side and not the vampire's side. Then Ethan touches the schoolmaster's soldier and goes into his mind and tells him, You're not strong it's the thing\\" and then they all run out of the building. Sarah Sarah (portrayed by Vanessa Morgan) is Jane's babysitter, and one of Ethan's best friends who he has a crush on. Although most times, she ends up babysitting Ethan and Benny as well. By the time the pilot movie begins, she is already a new vampire, bitten by her ex-boyfriend Jesse. Since she has not drunk human blood, she is only a fledgling, not fully human, not fully vampire. Hoping for a cure to become human again, Sarah tries her best to fit into high school and be a normal teenage girl, though she is unsuccessful. She refrains from human blood and instead, drinks a human blood substitute that Benny's grandmother makes. Sarah usually aids Ethan and Benny in their quests to defeat supernatural forces and has excellent fighting skills which, combined with her superhuman strength and speed, make her a formidable opponent. She struggles to keep her friends protected from evil vampires, particularly Jesse. In the first-season finale, she finally turns into a full vampire when Ethan is bitten by Jesse and she drinks his blood to get the venom out. Although upset at first, she is later shown to somewhat accept what she is in the end. Later on Sarah begins to develop a romantic relationship with best friend and supernatural partner Ethan Morgan in the two part Season 2 finale, \\"The Date to End All Dates.\\" Benny Benny Weir (portrayed by Atticus Mitchell) is Ethan's loud and goofy best friend. He is similar to Ethan, being geeky. He often gets into trouble with his antics. Benny has been Ethan's best friend since they were 6 years old. He and Ethan understand each other better than anyone else, although Benny is more funny and outspoken than Ethan. Benny can be just as brave and strategically clever as his pal, though he only showcases these abilities in the most dire of situations. Benny's dream is to make it big as a sorcerer and paranormal expert. He is told by his grandma that he is a Spellmaster and can cast magical spells, although his magic usually goes wrong due to his lack of practice. Benny often tries to lighten the mood when things get too intense. He is girl-crazy and frequently drags Ethan into his schemes, getting them both in trouble. Despite that, Benny is a genuine friend to Ethan and is always ready to go on another adventure. In season two, Benny begins to improve on his magic, becoming more helpful than in the first season. Benny secretly has a crush on Erica. But he doesn't know that she starts to feel the same. Rory Rory Keaner (portrayed by Cameron Kennedy) is Ethan and Benny's geeky, dimwitted, and funny, vampire friend. He is turned into a vampire after being bitten by Erica at a vampire-infested party. No matter how odd Ethan and Benny are, Rory still manages to be the odd man out. He is even more immature than Ethan and Benny and has ideas that often gets him or all three of them into bad situations. Rory is a follower instead of a leader and has a major crush on Erica and is always eager to impress her, a trend which is in line with the traditional biter-bitten relationship. He is easily manipulated and does whatever he is told to do which leads him to become a full vampire (in the movie he says that his first reason for drinking human blood was because \\"everyone else was doing it\\"). Ethan and Benny mostly try to keep Rory out of their adventures, knowing that Rory can get himself into danger with his weak intellect. Rory includes himself nevertheless and though he can be foolish, he supports Ethan and Benny to the best of his ability. Embracing his new-found vampirism, he goes through several short-lived personae including 'Vampire Ninja' and 'Rory Vampire'. He's a fond lover of animals both as pets (he kept a cat called Mr Kitty and two alligators which he mistook for iguanas) and as a delicacy. In the movie he promises Ethan he'll not drink human blood again and sticks to this promise throughout the series only hunting animals, something other vampires including Sarah and Erica find disgusting, though he happily drinks bagged human blood again in \\"Blood Drive\\" and \\"Fanged and Furious\\" where he fights over a phial of it with Erica. In \\"The Date to end All Dates- Part 2\\" he shows courage (or complete stupidity) being ready to face a hooded menace until he finds out the intruder is his vice-principal, only at this point does he cow down and runs. He later displays his loyalty with Erica when he says that \\"if there's a fight coming I want to be here with my friends\\", he only avoids the battle when placed under Anastasia's powerful glamour. Rory's last name \\"Keaner\\" was shown on a computer screen in episode \\"Siren Song\\". Erica Erica (portrayed by Kate Todd) is a vampire and Sarah's best friend. She is a huge fan of the \\"Dusk\\" series. (Dusk is a parody of the Twilight series) Erica becomes a vampire after being bitten by Gord (one of Jesse's friends) in the same vampire-infested party where Rory was also bitten. Erica is the kind of girl who gets revenge if someone does her wrong. She used to be a nerd when human but has become beautiful since turning into a vampire, a fact she is very proud of. Erica doesn't share an actual friendship with Ethan and Benny but speaks to them when necessary. She is annoyed mostly by Rory and makes sure not to be seen with him. However, she uses his crush on her as an advantage to get him to do things for her. Although Erica is conceited and shallow, she genuinely cares for Sarah and always comes through for her. In the first- season finale, she supports Sarah after Sarah becomes a full vampire and tells her that they will (literally) be friends forever. In the second season, Erica becomes closer to Ethan and Benny as well, and subsequently becomes more active in their heroic activities. Erica seeks out Benny to help Sarah out after she dumped the new vice principal in a trash can, Benny doing a forgetting spell and gathers him and Ethan to testify against the Vampire Council's accusations. In \\"Say You'll Be Maztak\\", Erica helps Sarah get their male classmates out of a spell where they were controlled by Lucia, who wanted to be reunited with her Sun King. Erica seemed to be jealous that Ethan and Benny were all over Lucia, not believing that they were blowing her and Sarah off for her. In \\"Mirror/rorriM\\", Erica is controlled by a ghost trapped in a dressing room mirror during the school's production of the play, \\"The Rainbow Factory\\". Benny, Ethan, and Sarah manage to get the ghost out of Erica, in the middle of the play, the audience assuming they were performing. In \\"Village of the Darned\\", Benny makes a potion mixed with his blood for Erica and Sarah (because the towns' older citizens were possessed by an evil girl scout troop leaders cookies), Erica initially takes dislike to drinking blood from children and teenagers, citing it had fats; but Erica confides to Sarah that she liked Benny's blood, that it was \\"the best she ever tasted\\", and she might be starting to have feelings for him. In \\"The Date to End All Dates\\", while the vampire community is preparing to evacuate Whitechapel (in which Erica reluctantly and unwillingly helps them do), Erica helps Sarah and Ethan prepare for their first date, even choosing their restaurant, which was a vampire restaurant, where the staff assumed Ethan was Sarah's meal. Recurring Characters Jane Morgan Jane Morgan (portrayed by Ella Jonas Farlinger) is Ethan's younger, 9-year-old sister. She has her own strange view of the world around her. Jane knows about Ethan's, Benny's, Sarah's, Rory's and Erica's supernatural abilities and keeps the secret, often helping along when they are in dangerous situations. She usually gets her way by blackmailing Ethan, threatening to tell their parents about all of Ethan, Benny, and Sarah's secret adventures. Although she is manipulative, she cares for Ethan and shares a friendly and easy relationship with Benny. Jane seems to have certain limited abilities to cast spells; She once used one of Benny's spells to bring one of her dolls to life and gets her parents and others turned into little dolls after being touched by Jane's doll, prompting Ethan, Benny and Sarah to come to the rescue and turn everyone back to normal again. Samantha Morgan Samantha Morgan (portrayed by Laura DeCarteret) is the mother of Ethan and Jane Morgan. She is a fun-loving, supportive mom to Ethan and Jane, and will do whatever she can to keep her kids happy. She and her husband go out on date nights every Friday, which is when Sarah is needed to babysit. Although she doesn't quite understand her kids, she loves them all the same. Ross Morgan Ross Morgan (portrayed by Ari Cohen) is the father of Ethan & Jane Morgan and Samantha Morgan's husband. When Ross isn't taking cookery/dancing/archery lessons with his wife, he sells insurance ‚Äì which oddly enough is something people in Whitechapel seem to need a lot of. Ross is a proud father to Ethan and Jane, even though he doesn't always understand his son's geeky hobbies. But that doesn't stop him from trying to connect with him. Benny's Grandma Benny's Grandma EvelynMy Babysitter's A Vampire - Season 2, Episode 8 Independence Daze ‚Äì Grandma's first name, Evelyn, revealed at 1:56 (portrayed by Joan Gregson) is an Earth Priestess (a witch on the side of good) who knows what to do in every situation that Ethan and Benny get themselves into. She also has everything that often ends up causing the problem. She tends to be sardonic, especially while scolding the boys. Principal Hicks Principal Hicks (played by Hrant Alianak) is the often dimwitted principal of Whitechapel High School, usually blissfully unaware of what is really going on around him. He often appears concerned about Ethan and Benny because of their weirdness and unusual hobbies. Jesse Jesse (portrayed by Joe Dinicol) is an evil vampiric cult leader and main antagonist in the movie. In the original settlement of Whitechapel, he was a priest named Reverend Horace Black, and led an evil vampire cult. In recent times, he poses as a high school student. His personality is pure callous, being willing to sacrifice any follower for his own gains. This is shown numerous times such as in the movie when he didn't react to the news that his entire new cult was eliminated by Ethan, Benny and Sarah, and in The Date to end All Dates when he admitted he'd let \\"most of his old flock\\" get wiped out by the Lucrifractor two hundred years ago and was extremely willing to let Benny be destroyed when the would-be wizard temporarily turned against them. His plan throughout the movie was to use the cubile animus to exchange the souls of 219 Dusk fans in order to resurrect the 219 ancient souls of the vampires in his cult, known as the \\"Black Army\\". He was also the vampire who originally sired Sarah, turning her into a fledgling, and his minions turned Rory and Erica into vampires at his house party. When Ethan and Benny become aware of the existence of vampires, they team up with Sarah to help stop Jesse. Days later Jesse comes close to succeeding in his plan but he and his minions are killed by Ethan and Benny before he can complete it. In the first-season finale, he returns from the grave after Ethan and Benny dig up and inadvertently open the cubile animus he was trapped in. He tries to convince Sarah to become a full vampire so they can be together and leave Whitechapel. When Sarah refuses, Jesse bites Ethan's wrist to infect him with vampire venom, compelling Sarah to save him and become a full vampire after all. Jesse leaves, unharmed, and is later banished from Whitechapel by the Vampire Council for being an \\"undesirable element\\". Jesse returns in the Season 2 finale to give Ethan a message about someone seeking the powers of the Lucifractor. He says that he cannot deal with it himself due to his banishment. Following Stern succeeding in driving out the vampire council, Ethan invites Jesse back, as he managed to defeat the original wizard Gaelon Sinisteral. Jesse joins them in facing Stern. Jesse is a handsome but sinister vampire whose charming smile hides a deep, dark secret that is centuries old. Not one to leave his fangs idle for long, Jesse has ambitious plans that he is determined to see succeed. he hopes to one day control not only all of whitechapel, but especially the heart of one beautiful young lady named Sarah. Mr. G Mr. G (portrayed by Ryan Blakely) is a teacher who often gets wrapped up in the supernatural goings-on that happen at the school, whether he is fully aware or not. He first appears in \\"Double Negative\\" to take the yearbook photos but an evil version of Hannah Price is out to use Benny's grandmother's evil camera to make evil doubles of the students. Mr. G is also seen as the school's wrestling team coach in \\"Friday Night Frights\\". Mr. G unearths a crystal skull which summons Lucia, a queen looking for her Sun King. Mr. G is later controlled by Lucia, she seeking him to be bearer of a sacred vessel. When the spell is broken over Mr. G (and the other male students), he gives Sarah and Erica detention for smashing the skull he dug up, Mr. G never gave students detention prior to this. Vice Principal Stern Vice Principal Stern (portrayed by Richard Waugh) The new vice principal in Whitechapel's high school and the main antagonist in season two. He made his first appearance in \\"Welcome back Dusker\\" where he was quickly met with Sarah's highly emotional wrath and was plunged headfirst into a trashcan by the newly fully-fledged vampire. His Great grandfather (Gaelon Sinisteral) was a wizard who hated vampires, and attempted to wipe them out but was defeated by Reverend Horace Black (a.k.a. Jesse). Centuries later, Stern planned to do the same. Around the same time as he got the job as vice principal, he conjured the breath of death to begin his vampire genocide, but that plan soon failed. In The Date to End all Dates we also learn from Erica that she despised him since he banned the Dusk Fanclub, no doubt due to its affiliation with vampires. He later attempts to kill Ethan in \\"Independence Daze\\" whilst wearing a Grim Reaper-esque disguise and is referred to as \\"some guy without a face\\". In the episode Date To End All Dates, his secret is revealed that his new goal was finding the Lucifactor to wipe out all vampires in Whitechapel. He attempts to steal it from Benny and Rory after they find it in the abandoned Darkwood hotel, but was thwarted when he found himself face to face with Jesse's \\"guard dog\\". Later he confiscates the Lucifractor from Benny and places Ethan under a spell, making him fear everyone is dead. When Stern attacks the vampire council, he kills several vampires and chases the rest away. He plans to use their beacon (which Jesse states is referred to as \\"the Caller\\") to broadcast the Lucifractor's power across town. Benny is put temporarily under his control, but is taken out by his own magic and the vice- principal is soon defeated by Ethan after Sarah and Jesse successfully distract him. Ethan telepathically attacks Stern, and uses the man's own arrogance against him, causing him to absorb energy from the Lucifractor and results in a huge explosion. Minor Characters Gord Gord (portrayed Nathan Stephenson) is Jesse's right-hand man, and another vampire. He becomes Erica's boyfriend and turns her into a vampire. He is later killed in the climax by holy water rigged sprinklers. Della Della (portrayed by Rebecca Dalton) is a normal student at Whitechapel High, who gets her heart broken after the death of her dog, Puffles.

Della is said to be attending therapy since she can't forget Puffles. Della is seen again in the first-season finale at the school dance, later talking with Rory. Stephanie Stephanie (portrayed by Leah Renee Cudmore (young), Susan Robertson (elder)) is an old witch, disguised as the cheerleader captain, and the antagonist of the episode, Three Cheers for Evil. She went to school with Benny's grandmother but physically looks 17 because she has used her powers to maintain immortality. It's revealed that Stephanie teased Erica when Erica used to be a nerd as a human. Stephanie puts a spell on Erica and Sarah so they obey her. On the night of the school pep rally, Ethan and Benny are able to thwart her plan to steal the souls of the student body and Stephanie's real age is unmasked. An old Stephanie ends up as a lunch lady at Whitechapel High. Annie Vee Annie \\"Hot Nurse\\" Vee (portrayed by Kristin Adams) is the Hot Nurse who appeared in the episode \\"Blood Drive\\". Annie was the better-looking and younger nurse at the Blood Drive in Whitechapel. She is a vampire who has worked with the older vampire nurse for years, using blood drives to get their food. She thinks she can do anything and does not like to get involved with the Vampire Council. Benny only went to donate blood because he wanted Annie to do it. Benny then learns she is one of the bloodsuckers and lets Erica and Rory away for a pint of blood from Ethan. Older Nurse The Older Nurse (portrayed by Amy Ciupak Lalonde) is a character who appeared in the episode Blood Drive. She and Annie are vampire nurses that first appeared in Blood Drive. She makes all the decisions and is the leader of the two. She always thinks that mistakes should be justified and wanted to take Erica and Rory to the Vampire Council for stealing food from their own kind. She took blood out of Benny when he thought that Annie would. Debbie Dazzle Debbie Dazzle (portrayed by Georgina Reilly) is Jane's favorite doll. She was turned into a human after Jane cast a spell on her to fix her broken leg. She is the antagonist in the episode \\"Guys and Dolls.\\" Debby loves cupcakes, ice cream, disco-dance parties and make overs. Debbie didn't like being a doll, claiming that it was boring and she wanted to have fun. In order to stay in human form, she sucks life energy out of humans, thus turning them into dolls. Jane manages to reverse the spell to change Debbie back into a doll. But in the end she turn her head at the audience and wink at them. Her counterpart doll is Dazzle Dan. Her look is seemingly based on Katy Perry, though this is never mentioned in the series. Hannah Price Hannah Price (portrayed by Kiana Madeira) is the photographer, and the leader of the yearbook committee at Whitechapel High in the episode Double Negative. Ethan and Benny mistakenly believe she has a crush on Ethan after misinterpreting her actions. It was found at the end, that she had a boyfriend. She bought a camera from Benny at a yard sale for $10 and wanted to use the camera for yearbook photos, not knowing of its evil powers. Coach Ed Coach Ed (portrayed by Cl√© Bennett) is a character in the episode, Friday Night Frights. He is a ghost whose spirit was locked into Whitechapel High's sole sports trophy. His spirit was released when Ethan held the trophy, and haunted him relentlessly. Ethan tried to confide in Sarah and Benny to get rid of him, but in the end he agreed to win a new trophy for his spirit to move on. Though Ethan 'cheated' to win the trophy, the coach's spirit was banished by the ghosts of those he coached. Kurt \\"The Hurt\\" Lochner Kurt Lochner (portrayed by William Greenblatt) is an ace wrestler who appears in Friday Night Frights. In this episode, he is dating Erica, and Sarah is led to suspect that he is a vampire and tries to investigate; only leading Ethan to think that she likes him. Ethan and Kurt meet during a wrestling match, and Ethan wins a trophy by pinching him to the floor and tickling his neck to keep him under. He tries to beat up Ethan, but Sarah knocks him to the ground and confirms that he has been \\"beaten by a geek and a girl\\". He is last seen on a date with Erica, who shows him her fangs. It is unknown what happened to him later. David Stachowski David Stachowski (portrayed by Jake Epstein) is a character from the episode Blue Moon. He is the hairiest jock at Whitechapel High and very popular. He makes Ethan and Benny his best friends but Ethan suspects that David is a werewolf and has a motive behind making them his friends. Benny tries a spell to expose him, but it has no effect whatsoever. However Ethan has a vision that confirms his suspicions of David. He then sees that David scratched him and starts to turn into a werewolf. It is revealed that David knew Ethan is a Seer and was hoping Ethan could help him find the cure to become human again. During a party at Ethan's house, Ethan and Benny find out that David isn't an actual werewolf after Sarah, Benny, Rory, and Erica mistake Ethan as David; he simply turns into a shaggy dog under the full moon, making him a weredog. Doug Falconhawk/Machowski Doug Falconhawk (true name Doug Machowski, portrayed by Thomas Mitchell) is the host of his own television show that called him the Scarefinder. Rory, Benny and Ethan are his only fans because his lack of locating paranormal activities is boring the audience except those three. He makes his first appearance in Doug The Vampire Hunter and hires the kids to hunt vampires. His show is eventually ruined by his fans. Dirk Baddison Dirk Baddison (played by Jamie Johnston) is the actor who portrays the vampire named James in the Dusk series, he appears in \\"Welcome Back Dusker\\" when Ethan starts the rumor that he's coming to Whitechapel, in order to get Sarah to come back. Erica abducts Dirk, showing him that she's a vampire and that vampires are real, Dirk involuntarily gets dragged in front of the vampire council with Erica, and the head of the council likes Dirk, wanting his autograph for \\"a friend\\". Dirk is placed into a psychiatric facility after going to the media and saying he has a vampire girlfriend, pictures he took with Erica showed that only he was in the pictures, because vampires don't show up on film. Anastasia Anastasia (portrayed by Addison Holley) is first introduced in \\"Welcome back Dusker\\" as a little girl who is after Ethan and Sarah because vampires are being attacked by an ominous green mist later identified by Benny as, \\"The Breath of Death\\". She initially accuses Ethan of being the one behind the vampire attacks as he is a known vampire hunter and because vampires sent by the Council to retrieve his love interest Sarah were killed in his garden. When one of the other council members is taken over by the Breath of Death and tries to go after her, Ethan saves her and she believes that he has nothing to do with it. She secretly likes Dirk Baddison, asking to have his autograph \\"for a friend\\". Her personality is heavily juxtaposed to her demeanor, as she is very assertive (despite being on a council where each member has an equal vote, she always takes charge and no one seems willing to go against her) and also sinister and scary, usually resorting to death threats to get things done. Rory claims she's \\"scary\\" (at the end of \\"The Date to End All Dates\\") while Benny refers to her as \\"Little Miss Fang-Fang\\". Her sense of style both in her outfits and possessions (such as her choice of duffle bag in \\"The Date to end all Dates- Part 2\\") shows that despite her youthful appearance she is actually several centuries old. Despite banishing him, she is somewhat similar to Jesse, being quick to use force, mind control and is very williing to sacrifice her followers to save herself (Jesse freely admits he allowed most of his \\"flock\\" to be Lucifractored so he could defeat Stern's great-grandfather and Anastasia happily sent guards at Stern knowing they had no chance of defeating him while she fled Whitechapel. She also says that Stern could \\"have this town\\" (Whitechapel), in essence leaving every vampire in Whitechapel at the mercy of the vengeful vice- principal by leaving the Caller (a device Jesse says the Council uses to communicate with other covens) undefended). Most likely she only forced Rory and Erica to flee with her as all her remaining guards were busy holding off Stern while the rest of her Council had already fled. Lucia Lucia (portrayed by Shiva Negar) is a queen in search of her Sun King, Mr. G summons her when he digs up a crystal skull around the school. Lucia uses Mr. G and his male students to get reunited with her Sun King. The students make an altar out of the classroom desks for Lucia along with finding things such as animal hearts, gold, and jewelry. And Lucia initially chooses Rory to be \\"The Chosen One\\", or a sacrifice to the Sun King, but when she learns Rory is a vampire and isn't pure, she moves onto Ethan instead, who is breaking from Lucia's control over him. Sarah and Erica defeat Lucia after learning that the moon could interfere with Lucia's plan, they use moon rocks that Ethan bought to get their friends and classmates out of Lucia's spell. Ethan destroys Lucia using a moon rock as well, the skull crashing to the floor in the process. Malcolm Bruner Malcolm Bruner (portrayed by Scott Beaudin) is a Whitechapel High student whose grandfather had recently passed in the episode \\"Fanged and Furious\\". Ethan wanted to buy his grandfather's clunker car, but chose against it when he learned the car was possessed by a vampire. Bruner threatens to have Ethan's learner's permit revoked because he thinks Ethan stole the car and tried to run him over with it. When he came to school the next day he was all bandaged up and Rory told him his bandages were leaking. Sunday Clovers Sunday Clovers (portrayed by Bindi Irwin) is an energetic foreign exchange student from Australia who becomes lead in the school's upcoming play, \\"The Rainbow Factory\\", where Erica is assigned as her understudy. Clovers looks in a possessed dressing room mirror and she is controlled by the ghost trapped in it, to harm her classmates involved in the play. In the process of doing that, Clovers cuts numerous sandbags hoping to hurt her classmates, many of them fell on her in the process, breaking both of her legs; Sarah thought suspiciously that Erica did it to become lead in the play. Clovers watches a controlled Erica on stage the night of the play, sitting by Ethan's mother, both amazed at Erica's \\"acting\\". Boltz In \\"Jockenstein\\", Boltz is a robotic hockey player at Whitechapel High, invented by the coach to win games, taking human body parts to make him. The coach abducts Ethan and tries to take Ethan's brain and put it into Boltz to make him the greatest hockey player ever, until Sarah manages to stop the coach while Benny and Erica try to dismantle Boltz. Hottie Ho-Tep Hottie Ho- Tep (portrayed by Jesse Rath) is an ancient Egyptian mummy that took the form of a human teen by taking magical objects from Benny's home, after Benny took his pancreas, causing his mummy to break out of its sarcophagus. Hottie falls for Sarah and vice versa, trying to take her back to the underworld with her as his. Benny and Ethan manage to stop him by shaking Hottie's ancient artifacts that were buried with him. Serena Serena (portrayed by Kendra Timmins) is a local singing sensation who has the voice of an angel, but in reality she's a siren; a mythical creature whose songs bring out the self- destructive worst in anyone who hears it. Ethan, Benny, and Rory sign up for the talent show to stop Serena, using her songs against her, to stop her from bringing out the worst of people in the whole town. Richard Bruner Richard (portrayed by Trevor Coll) is grandson of Milfred Bruner. A tall, handsome, snooty prep-school kid. Extremely condescending. Younger version of the Winklevoss twins from The Social Network. The gang figures out that Richard is the latest target of the evil car...so in order to save Richard they invite him over under the pretense of taking his picture for a \\"Charity Photo Shoot\\" and draw a tube of his blood. Rory takes on his identity to attract the evil car and stop it from its rage. Vivian Keaner Vivian Keaner (portrayed by Marsha Mason) is Rory's mother who is first seen in \\"Siren Song\\", cheering her son on at the school's talent show. Vivian bored Benny's grandmother in the audience with stories of what Rory does, praising that he'd be a veterinarian one day, blissfully unaware that her son's recent interest in small mammals was actually due to finding them more delicious than cute. Benny's grandmother turned off her hearing aid as a result. Backstage, Rory gets nervous when he hears his mum is in the audience, not because he's worried for his safety but actually for the rest of the audience as he claims his mum can \\"really throw them\\" in terms of throwing punches. Ms. Keaner is later seen to be taken over by Serena's songs, punching out a lady in the audience.

Federal Register April 13, 2010. This plant is a shrub growing up to about 75 centimeters tall. It is covered in tiny, curved, purplish hairs. The oppositely arranged leaves have thick, somewhat fleshy blades which are linear to lance-shaped and measure up to 7 centimeters long by less than a centimeter wide. The inflorescence is an open cyme of up to 55 flowers. The flower has small lance-shaped green sepals and no petals.Wagner, W. L., et al. (1994). Description of a rare new cliff-dwelling species from Kauai, Schiedea attenuata (Caryophyllaceae). Novon 4 187-90. This shrub grows on very steep basalt cliffs on the slopes of the Kalalau Valley of Kauai. Other plants in the habitat include Gouania meyenii, Peucedanum sandwicense, Poa mannii, Hedyotis sp., Lysimachia glutinosa, Melicope pallida, Dubautia sp., Dryopteris unidentata, Metrosideros polymorpha, Coprosma sp., Vaccinium sp., Lipochaeta sp., Wilkesia sp., Lobelia niihauensis, Lepidium serra, Nestegis sandwicensis, and Hibiscus kokio. When the plant was first described in 1994 there were only 20 individuals counted. By 2007 there had been no more plants discovered. One major threat to the species is the feral goat population. It is also threatened by the invasion of non-native plants into its habitat. Because there are only a few plants of this species, it could face extinction in any one major event, such as a hurricane.

The larvae sometimes form pear-shaped galls on willows (Salix spp). It was first described by Eugenius Johann Christoph Esper in 1783. Description The eggs are laid in axils, bark crevices or stump edges of Salix species from the end of May to late-July. The larvae feed inside the stems of various Salix species, including Salix viminalis. According to Heath and Emmet (1985) the larvae give little external sign apart from a slight browning, and at the edge of a broken stem frass may be seen. The larvae feed between the wood and the bark and can be found in their tunnels when the bark is peeled back. When there are galls they can be pear-shaped, or a ‚Ä≥peculiar shape‚Ä≥ with the ‚Ä≥diameter of the stem above the gall greater than that below, which continues for some distance‚Ä≥. Galls can be similar to the sallow clearwing (Synanthedon flaviventris). The pupa is 12‚Äì14 mm long and does not make a cocoon. The emergence holes have a diameter of circa 2.5 mm and before pupation can be hidden by a thin cap. The exuviae can remain protruding from the emergence holes for some time. The wingspan is 17‚Äì19 mm. Adults have clear wings, which are covered in scales only on the wing veins, the discal area and the wing edges. They have reddish patches at the tips of the forewings. The forewings are reddish coloured on the edges. The fringes are brownish. The discal stain is crescent-shaped, olive or reddish brown and extends from the front to the back edge. The hindwings have a narrow dark edge, as well as a small black-brown discal stain. The antennae, head, thorax and abdomen shine blue black. A red ring is located respectively on the fourth and fifth segment of the abdomen. Sometimes, also the sixth segment is reddish in colour. The hind tufts are strongly fan shaped, blue-black in colour, clear yellowish white on the sides. Adults are on wing from May to July, at higher elevations until August. They are particularly active in the sunshine and visit the flowers of different plants, such as those of elderberry Sambucus nigra, Origanum vulgare, Jacobaea vulgaris, Ligustrum vulgare and Rubus idaeus.

Education and early career  Stasik graduated from ≈Å√≥d≈∫ School of Medicine (now Medical University of ≈Å√≥d≈∫) and later studied toxicology at the University of Surrey, United Kingdom. He obtained his Dr Med. at the Heidelberg University, Germany's oldest university. In the 1960s he completed his training in internal medicine, and became director of the newly created clinical department of acute poisoning at the Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine in ≈Å√≥dz. There he also pioneered in the field of poison control centers in Poland. During this period he published one of the first clinical works devoted to acute toxicity of tetraethyllead in humans.M. J. Stasik et al.: Acute Tetraethyllead Poisoning. Archives of Toxicology, 24, 283‚Äì291, 1969 This substance was commonly used as an antiknock agent in gasoline until 2005.  Further career  Since 1970 he has been living in Germany, with two breaks for training at the Institute of Toxicology of the University of W√ºrzburg and for university study in the UK. In Frankfurt he directed a centre of toxicology and epidemiology within the department of occupational medicine of a chemical concern Hoechst AG. His research was focused on defining the carcinogenic potential of some aromatic amines, e.g. 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine and derivatives of aniline, as well as ethylene oxide and formaldehyde. In the 1980s Stasik represented Hoechst at scientific conferences of the Chemical Industry Institute of Toxicology (USA), as well as symposiums of the Center for Environmental Epidemiology, University of Pittsburgh. These were organized in co-operation with the United States Environmental Protection Agency. He was also a member of the Ecology and Toxicology Centre and the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC) in Brussels. In recent years he co-operated with the Institute of Social, Occupational and Environmental Medicine at the Gutenberg University, as well as with the Department of Histology and Embryology of the Medical University of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ in order to continue and to publish his works on carcinogenic aromatic amines.  Main achievements  In Frankfurt, while investigating simple arylamines, Stasik discovered that 4-chloro-o-toluidine (4-COT), used as an intermediate for the manufacture of dyestuffs, pigments, and chlordimeform a pesticide, causes cancer of the urinary bladder in humans. As a direct consequence of this discovery a worldwide ban was imposed on production and use of this arylamine IARC Monographs Volume 99, 4-chloro-o- toluidine Professor Klaus Norpoth in his handbook of occupational medicine mentions Miros≈Çaw Stasik for the discovery of the cancer risk of 4-COT as one of 15 international researchers, who over two centuries discovered occupational carcinogenic substances, starting from Percivall Pott (1775), through Ludwig Rehn (1895), John Creech and Maurice Johnson (1974) to Stasik (1987).M.

It was primarily awarded for bravery or other military virtue on the battlefield. The award was reestablished on 20 July 1940 by the Belgian government in exile for recognition of bravery and military virtue during World War II. The post-1940 decoration could also be awarded to units that were cited. The decoration was again reestablished by royal decree on 3 April 1954 for award during future conflicts. World War I Reverse of the WW1 Croix de guerre Award statute The World War I Croix de guerre was established by royal decree on 25 October 1915 as an award for bravery or other military virtue on the battlefield. It was only awarded to individuals. The Croix de guerre was not only awarded for bravery but also for three years or more of service on the front line, or for good conduct on the battlefield. It was also awarded to volunteers older than 40 or younger than 16 after a minimum of 18 months of service, to escaped prisoners of war rejoining the armed forces, and to military personnel who were placed on inactive duty because of injury. Award description The World War I Croix de guerre was a 40mm wide bronze Maltese cross with 3mm in diameter balls at its eight points. It had a 14mm in diameter central medallion bearing the relief image of a \\"lion rampant\\" on its obverse and the royal cypher of King Albert I on its reverse. Two 37mm long crossed swords point upwards between it arms. A 14mm high \\"inverted V\\" between the two points of the top cross arm is secured to the inside of a 25mm wide by 25mm high royal crown, the ribbon's suspension ring passes through the top orb of the crown giving the cross a total height of 65mm. The ribbon of the World War I Croix de guerre is red wide, with five wide light green longitudinal stripes, three at the center separated by and one on each side 3 mm from the edges. When the person being awarded the Croix de guerre was mentioned in despatches, this distinction was denoted by a device worn on the ribbon, either a small lion or a palm adorned with the monogram \\"A\\" (for Albert I): *Bronze lion: regimental level *Silver lion: brigade level *Gold lion: divisional level *Bronze palm: Army level *Silver palm: five bronze palms *Gold palm: five silver palms When awarded posthumously, the ribbon of the Croix de guerre was adorned with a narrow black enamel bar.

It was still mainly awarded to individuals, but was now also authorized as a unit award. A war cross being presented to a unit was denoted by a ribbon of the war cross being affixed to the unit colours The Belgian fourrag√®re was awarded by the Belgian Government to a unit that was cited twice. Award of the fourrag√®re was not automatic and required a specific decree of the Belgian Government. The fourrag√®re is in the same colours as the ribbon of the World War II Croix de guerre. The Belgian fourrag√®re was only worn by those who were members of the unit at the time of the award. Award description The World War II Croix de guerre was constructed in the same dimensions as its World War I predecessor, the only real difference being the royal cypher of King Leopold III on its reverse. The new ribbon was still red with light green stripes but there were now six, 1mm wide, and positioned three on each side 2mm apart beginning 2mm from the edge of the ribbon. The same ribbon devices were used as in World War I except the palms were now adorned with the monogram \\"L\\" (for Leopold III).

This decoration is intended to be awarded in a manner akin the World War II statute during potential future wars. The 1954 Croix de guerre has not yet been awarded. Award description The post-1954 (or current) Croix de guerre is similar to the previous variants but with a different reverse center medallion now bearing the Coat of arms of Belgium in lieu of a royal monogram. The ribbon is a colour reversal of the World War II Croix de guerre ribbon, green with three narrow 1mm wide red stripes 2mm apart on each side beginning 2mm from the edge.

He twice played football for Scotland in the unofficial international matches in 1871 and 1872. Early life and education Elliot was born at Vizagapatam, India, the son of Walter Elliot (1803‚Äì1887), the Scottish naturalist, and Maria Dorothea Hunter Blair (c.1816‚Äì1890). His mother was the daughter of Sir David Hunter-Blair, 3rd Baronet. Elliot was educated at Windlesham House School, near Washington, West Sussex and Harrow from January 1867 to Easter 1870. Football career Elliot played football for Harrow Chequers, before joining the Wanderers club, making his debut for them in a 5‚Äì0 victory over Forest School on 28 November 1871. He continued to appear regularly for the Wanderers over the next two years, with his final game coming on 22 March 1873. In the 1873 \\"Football Annual\\", he was described as \\"a truly ponderous fellow but successful as a dribbler withal; has been known to kick a goal.\\" He was selected to represent Scotland in the representative matches against England on 18 November 1871 and 24 February 1872, playing as a forward in the first match, won 2‚Äì1 by England, and as a back in the second match, which England won 1‚Äì0. Later in life, he also played cricket for the Marylebone Cricket Club, making four listed appearances between June 1897 and August 1903. Military and political career He enrolled with the Dumfries, Roxburgh, Kirkcudbright and Selkirk (Scottish Borderers) Militia in May 1873. He joined the regular army as a lieutenant in the 82nd Regiment in 1874. He was promoted to captain in 1884 and in 1888, he was transferred to the 40th, later South Lancashire Regiment. His final promotion came in 1894 to the rank of major. In March 1894, he succeeded Colonel Patrick Boyle, the son of the Earl of Glasgow, as private secretary and ADC to the Governor in New Zealand. He retired on 25 January 1899. Later career On 27 September 1905, he married Edith Margaret Crawford, the daughter of Rev. J.C. Crawford, of Coulsdon, Surrey; they had no children.

Plot On a Hawaiian island, Professor Lovegrove, and a group of scientists are researching eggs that belong to two piranha/anaconda hybrids. However, one of the snakes kills all of the scientists except for Lovegrove, who escapes into the jungle. Meanwhile, a film crew on the island is in the middle of filming a slasher movie. Several crew wander off, and are killed by the snakes before director Milo, lead actress Kimmy Weston, scriptwriter Rose, her stuntman boyfriend Jack, and pyro tech expert Gunner are captured by a group of criminals led by Pike, and his girlfriend Talia, and held for ransom in an abandoned mill, along with Lovegrove, whom the criminals had discovered wandering the jungle earlier. Jack, and Gunner manage to escape, and systematically take out a few of the criminals before placing Gunner's explosives around the mill as a diversion to rescue the hostages. During the escape, Milo steals a gun, and stays behind as a distraction so the others can escape. The group reaches a car, and one of the snakes soon arrives, and kills Talia. Gunner detonates the explosives, only to be killed by a stray bullet moments later. Jack, Rose, Lovegrove, and Kimmy drive off, and are chased by Pike, who shoots a bazooka at the car, although Jack swerves off the road, causing the rocket to hit, and kill one of the snakes instead. The group soon runs out of gas, and resolves to reach a marina nearby. Meanwhile, Milo escapes the mill, and encounters a girl whose fianc√©e was previously killed by the snake; both are then killed shortly afterward. At the marina, the group finds a working boat, but Jack plans to kill the remaining snake by luring it into the explosive-filled car. However, the criminals soon arrive, although the snake does too, killing all of the criminals, including Pike. Kimmy runs inside the car to get the detonator for the explosives, although the snake kills her before she can activate it. An injured Jack has Rose, and Lovegrove escape on the boat while he stays behind to distract the snake. On the boat, Rose discovers that Lovegrove is in possession of an egg belonging to the snake, which is why it is chasing them. As the snake pursues them underwater, Rose pushes Lovegrove off the boat, and he is eaten. She reaches land, and reunites with Jack, who attaches an explosive to the egg container before they lure the snake over to a waterfall, throwing the container into its mouth before the explosive detonates, and killing it. Jack, and Rose jump into a waterfall to avoid the explosion, and share a kiss in the water, although a third snake promptly kills them.

Corman hired him to write the film. MacLean said \\"I learned from Roger that a cable movie is a different animal than a theatrical release. First and foremost, cable movies must be faster-paced. With a theatrical release, the audience has driven to the mall, bought a ticket, and fought the crowds for a seat. They've made an investment in the viewing experience, so they're not walking out on the film if it's pacing is a bit leisurely. A cable movie audience has the remote within reach... So you have to keep things moving, which means showing the creature soon and often.\\" MacLean added that \\"these films must have an element of comedic irony... the effects still can't compete with the big studio blockbusters. So they're has to be a comedic undercurrent to the story. Audiences are more likely to accept a less-than-realistic effect if they know they're laughing with the filmmakers.\\" Piranhaconda was filmed in Kaua ªi, Hawai ªi,\\"Piranhaconda - film location\\".

In some specialized applications even small metal or plastic assembly components can be loaded and dispensed by small hopper systems. In the case of dust collection hoppers the dust can be collected from expelled air. Hoppers for dust collection are often installed in groups to allow for a greater collection quantity. Hoppers are used in many industries to hold material until it is needed, such as flour, sugar or nuts for food manufacturing, food pellets for livestock, crushed ores for refining, etc. Dust hoppers are employed in industrial processes that use air pollution control devices such as dust collectors, electrostatic precipitators, and baghouses/fabric filters. Most hoppers are made of steel. Process Materials can be added either manually or automatically to the top of a hopper. For dust collection, it enters the hopper from a collection device. For example, baghouses are shaken or blown with compressed air to release caked-on dust from the bag. Precipitators use a rapping system to release the dirt. The crumbling dust falls into the hopper. Once the material in the hopper reaches capacity, it is released through an opening in the bottom with a diameter of about . Hoppers are rectangular or circular in cross section but have sides that slope at about a 60¬∞ angle. Slanted sides make it easier for the contained material to flow out. Conveyors are sometimes used to carry away the particulate matter. Important components Hopper walls are often insulated to protect the outside environment and personnel from the contents. Often, the bottom 1/4 - 1/3 of the container is heated to eliminate the possibility of condensation inside the hopper. The greatest difficulty associated with the removal of very fine material, like flour or dust, from a hopper is the compaction of the material. Moisture content, particle shape and size, and vibration are all factors that contribute to compaction. Typically, with such fine materials, vibrators are installed on the outer walls of a hopper to shake and release the material, however other kind of discharging aids can be considered if necessary https://powderprocess.net/Powder_Flow/Solve_Flow_Problems.html  References  Category:Air pollution control systems ","title":"Hopper (particulate collection container)"},{"id":"32456468","text":"Rani Prem Kaur, was the daughter of Lambardar Hari Singh Waraich a Jat Sikh of the village of Ladhewala Waraich, in Gujranwala district of the Punjab, was married in 1822 to Prince Sher Singh, one of the many sons of Maharaja Ranjit Singh.

Life He was born in Boston, Lincolnshire. For seven or eight years he officiated as a Calvinist minister there; but later he became a Unitarian, and acted as a Unitarian minister at Boston from 1805 to 1817. In 1817 he moved to Doncaster. Platts supplemented his ministerial income by teaching and compiling educational works. He was also a Liberal activist, and humorous speaker. He died at Doncaster, after a long illness, on 19 June 1837. His widow died in 1851, leaving five daughters. Works In 1825 Platts published five volumes of A New Universal Biography, containing lives of eminent persons in all ages and countries, arranged in chronological order, with alphabetical index. This work, founded mainly on previous works by John Aikin and Alexander Chalmers, extended only to the end of the sixteenth century; the rest remained in manuscript form. In 1827 appeared, Platts's New Self-interpreting Testament, containing many thousands of various Readings and Parallel Passages collected from the most approved Translators and Biblical Critics. In the preface the author claims to have combined the merits of Francis Fox and Clement Cruttwell. Another edition, in 4 vols. appeared in 1830. Platts also published: * ‚ÄòReflections on Materialism, Immaterialism, the Sleep of the Soul ‚Ä¶ and the Resurrection of the Body; being an Attempt to prove that the Resurrection commences at Death,‚Äô Boston, 1813. * ‚ÄòLetter to a Young Man, on his renouncing the Christian Religion and becoming a Deist,‚Äô 1820. * ‚ÄòThe Literary and Scientific Class-book,‚Äô &c.;, 1821; a selection was published by L.

M. verticillata is an annual or biennial that grow up to 1.7 meters in high and can inhabit woodland areas of different soil types. The small, symmetrical flowers have five white, pink or red petals (0.8 cm) and 13 or more stamens. Each flower has 3 narrow epicalyx bracts. The fruit is a dry, hairless nutlet. The leaves are simple and alternate. In temperate climates, it flowers from July to September and the seeds from August to October. The flowers of the plant are self-fertile but can also be pollinated by insects. Distribution The species originates in Asia. It is widely distributed in Europe and is considered an invasive plant. It is also present in North America, including most states in the USA. Uses The plant was an important leaf vegetable in pre-Han China and widely cultivated. Mallow is mentioned in Huangdi Neijing as one of the five consumable herbs (‰∫îËèú) which included mallow (Ëëµ), pea leaves (Ëóø), Allium macrostemon (Ëñ§), Welsh onion (Ëî•) and Garlic chives (Èü≠). It was deemed to be a major vegetable until the Northern Wei, supposedly. The technology for domesticating mallow was well recorded in Qimin Yaoshu. The acreages were dwindled since the Tang dynasty. In his Nong Shu [Agricultural Manual], Wang Zhen wrote that mallow came top among various vegetables, because \\"it could be alternative in years of crop failure, or be marinated to serve with staples\\". There were rare occasions that people cultivate or consume mallow, during the Ming dynasty. It is also grown as an ornamental plant.

Life Beadle matriculated at Pembroke College, Cambridge on 8 July 1613, and graduated BA in 1617. He was first rector of Little Leighs, in which capacity he signed a petition to Laud in favour of Thomas Hooker, afterwards a famous New England divine. He was presented by Laud to the rectory of Barnstone in May 1632, at the recommendation of Samuel Collins, who describes him as 'a young man' of a 'conformable way.' In Laud's account of his ' Province for 1633'there occurs the following entry: 'I did likewise convent Mr. John Beedle, rector of Barnstone in Essex, for omitting some part of the divine service and refusing conformity. But upon his submission and promise of reformation I dismissed him with a canonical admonition.' Later, in 1638, another entry shows that Laud had an eye upon him. Beadle was one of the 'classis' for the county of Essex. He was also one of the signatories to the historical' Essex Testimony.' In 1650 he is returned as 'an able preacher.' When the Act of Uniformity was passed in 1662, he elected to remain in his rectory. He died in 1667. The following entry is in the parish register: 'Beginning at the east end and north side lye interred the body of Mr. John Bedle 30 years rector of the parish, buried 11 May 1667.' His widow survived him many years, being buried 14 July 1676. There are entries of seven children of theirs baptised between 1632 and 1646. Works He was the author of the Journal or Diary of a Thankful Christian. Presented in some Meditations upon Numbers xxxiii. 2. By John Beadle, Master of Arts, and Minister of the Gospel at Barnstone in Essex, 1656.' In Arthur Wilson's 'Autobiography' there is this entry under 21 July 1644: 'Mr. Beedle, of Barnstone, preached at Leez [Leighs]. His text was Numbers xxxiii. 2, insisting upon this, that every Christian ought to keep a record of his own actions and ways. This made me run back to the beginning of my life, assisted by my memories and some small notes, wherein I have given a true, though a meane, delineation of eight and forty years progress in the world.' On 25 April 1656, he published his 'Journal or Diary' dedicated to Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick, and to the countess.

A more specific definition of Model- driven security specifically applies model-driven approaches to automatically generate technical security implementations from security requirements models. In particular, \\"Model driven security (MDS) is the tool supported process of modelling security requirements at a high level of abstraction, and using other information sources available about the system (produced by other stakeholders). These inputs, which are expressed in Domain Specific Languages (DSL), are then transformed into enforceable security rules with as little human intervention as possible. MDS explicitly also includes the run-time security management (e.g. entitlements/authorisations), i.e. run-time enforcement of the policy on the protected IT systems, dynamic policy updates and the monitoring of policy violations.\\" http://www.modeldrivensecurity.org Model-driven security is also well-suited for automated auditing, reporting, documenting, and analysis (e.g. for compliance and accreditation), because the relationships between models and technical security implementations are traceably defined through the model-transformations.Lang, U. and Schreiner, R.

When Wolf was asked why he decided to make another film adaptation of the play - the first was done in 1938 - he answered: \\"our objective was not the persecution of Jews... But the destiny of a liberal intellectual, who is forsaken by his class. This individual no longer believes in the middle class, and yet he does not find his way to the working class. His only escape becomes suicide\\".Professor Mamlock. DEFA Film Library at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Reception Professor Mamlock sold 940,000 tickets in East Germany, becoming a modest commercial success.Thomas Heimann. Bilder von Buchenwald. B√∂hlau (2005). . p. 69. The film won the Gold Prize in the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival on 23 July 1961. Wolf also received the Silver Lotus Award in the II International Film Festival of India, held in New Delhi in November 1961.Diethelm Weidemann, N. L. Gupta. India‚ÄìGDR Relations: A Review. Kalamkar Prakashan (1980). ASIN B0000EDUAU. p. 93. Daniela Berghahn considered the film as \\"paradigmatic\\" to DEFA's treatment of the persecution of Jews by the Nazis: by contrasting the apolitical, lethargic Mamlock to his son, Rolf, the passionate communist and resistance fighter, Wolf condemned the professor for failing to join the resistance and \\"utterly scandalously... Made him accountable for his own fate.\\"Daniela Berghahn. Hollywood behind the Wall: the cinema of East Germany. . p. 89. Anthony S. Coulson analyzed the picture as a belated metamorphosis of the title character, who ceases denying reality only when all is lost: \\"Mamlock's transformation is presented as a renunciation of his previous self... But that insight comes too late to save him and his kind... His fate is attributed to his failure to fight... Wolf's film reaffirms the political pathos of his father's play.\\"Se√°n Allan, John Sandford. DEFA: East German cinema, 1946‚Äì1992. . pp. 168‚Äì172.

It is a subtle propaganda film in which peaceful East Germany depicts West Germany as the forefront to neo-fascism, terrorism, and neo-colonialism. East Germany requires an \\"anti-fascist defense\\" against the West Germans. It depicts the city of Berlin following the end of World War II and the struggle between the split between democracy and communism. The film uses authentic footage from newsreels and images from both sides to convey the justification of the resurrection of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961. Plot This documentary film takes footage from West Berlin and East Berlin as they try to rebuild their city following the devastation of World War II. The film begins by noting that \\"This film was made in order for peace.\\" Karl Gass was contracted to create the film by the German Democratic Republic (GDR). The GDR was a state in the Eastern bloc during the Cold War. The film states that a city street can tell a story. Many street names in West Berlin are named after Americans who freed Germany from fascism. One example of this was Lucius D. Clay who pushed communism to the Eastern borders. The film focuses on the reconstruction of Berlin following World War II. The first order of business was putting the people back to work. Berlin held their first elections in 1946 which created an administration that would implement laws. Government officials in Western Berlin were against the socialization of Berlin and effectively split the city of Berlin in to East and West. However, because of the signing of the Potsdam Agreement, the Soviets had control of Berlin. Therefore, this became a global issue because the USSR and United States of America were trying to implement their spheres of influence on nations. The main point of the film was that Germany was tired of bloodshed. If the Berlin Wall could keep the nation from more death, they would be satisfied. Germany was trying to become the strongest military from the beginning of World War I, 1914, until the end of World War II, 1945, and it had taken a toll on the nation. East Germany was content with being a part of the Eastern world as long as war would end. Historical context Following World War II, another war started. Two nations became the frontrunners for world power: the US and the USSR. This created a power struggle between who would have the most influence for capitalism or socialism. Berlin was in the cross-fire between capitalist and socialist influence and it ended up splitting the city between East and West. Winston Churchill said that there was a metal curtain between the Eastern and Western hemisphere, and Berlin actually had a curtain, the Berlin Wall. Until its destruction in 1989, the city of Berlin was physically divided with little to no contact from the other side. This proves the influence that the US and USSR had on the world.

Dublin had won the previous two finals and were bidding for a third consecutive victory. Kerry, their opponents, denied them to secure their own third from four All-Ireland football titles they won during the 1970s. This was Kerry's first of four consecutive championships, setting them on the streak that inspired the five in a row that never occurred. In 2018, Martin Breheny listed this as the eighth greatest All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final.Breheny, Martin. \\"Martin Breheny's Greatest All-Ireland Finals\\". Irish Independent. 1 September 2018, p. 11. It is also noted for a famous first-half goal by Mikey Sheehy, with Sheehy lobbing the Dublin goalkeeper Paddy Cullen while Cullen argued with referee S√©amus Aldridge. Match Summary Dublin played the opening half towards the Railway End of Croke Park, that part of the stadium featuring Hill 16. Kerry played the first half towards the Canal End. Dublin dominated the opening third. Their goalkeeper Paddy Cullen, according to Con Houlihan, caught \\"a few swirling lofted balls, dropping almost onto his crossbar... as composed and technically correct as if being done to illustrate a text book\\". Cullen's distribution was also perfect during this period of the game. Dublin's \\"swift triangular\\" play led Kerry to foul their opponents and Jimmy Keaveney duly converted the frees. Kerry forward Eoin Liston roamed so far down field that his marker S√©an Doherty was within sight of the Kerry goal. With 25 minutes gone, Dublin were ahead by 0‚Äì6 to 0‚Äì1. Dublin kept confidently going forward until a quick brace of passes from Jack O'Shea and Pat Spillane put John Egan through on Cullen in the Dublin goal. Cullen was not far enough forward. He set off only for Egan to fist the football over his head and into the Dublin net. Kerry, encouraged, scored a few points only for Dublin to take the lead with a point of their own. John O'Keeffe took a free, deep within the Kerry half. Jack O'Shea caught the football and drove it on a long central trajectory to the 21-yard line. A fist from Mikey Sheehy sent the football behind Dublin's backs. Dublin goalkeeper Paddy Cullen kicked the ball away from Sheehy. Referee S√©amus Aldridge blew his whistle for a Kerry free. Sheehy then scored his famous lobbed goal, while Cullen argued with Aldridge.High Ball magazine, issue #6, 1998. Michael O'Hehir's befuddled live television commentary went: \\"Paddy Cullen going out for it... And Paddy Cullen... Oh dearie me. Paddy Cullen adjudged... Oh! A goal, in the greatest freak of all time! The referee gave a free to, eh, Kerry from the 14 metre line, here it is again. Nobody was expecting the ball to be kicked, and before Paddy Cullen could get back into the goal, the ball was in the net\\". The manner of the goal is still contentious today. While Aldridge had awarded a free to Kerry, there are those who maintain that Ger Power had fouled Cullen shortly before. In any event, Sheehy lobbed the ball over Cullen to give his team the lead. RT√â chose it as one of the Top 20 GAA Moments in 2005 and it features prominently in the 1978 episode of Reeling in the Years. According to Martin Breheny, it is also one of the most viewed incidents from the GAA's archives. Dublin's resistance collapsed in the second half. The half ended in a score of 3‚Äì8 to 0‚Äì2 in Kerry's favour. Eoin Liston scored the three second-half goals. Kerry won by seventeen points. Details Post-match In the Evening Press the following day, Con Houlihan memorably described Cullen's misfortune: \\"Paddy dashed back towards his goal like a woman who smells a cake burning. The ball won the race and it curled inside the near post as Paddy crashed into the outside of the net and lay against it like a fireman who had returned to find his station ablaze\\". Cullen and Sheehy recreated the goal in 2017 as part of the centenary commemorations of Austin Stacks (the club of Sheehy and Ger Power in Tralee). Cullen donned an apron for the occasion and roared \\"Me cake\\" as he ran towards the goal. Note: Some minor corrections to the written transcript of O'Hehir's commentary based on the video within. Kevin Moran was a member of the losing Dublin team that day. Moran is known to the English (and others) for his time spent playing soccer with Manchester United.

Both the ch√¢teau and garden are classified as Historic Monuments by the French Ministry of Culture: the gardens are classified as a jardin remarquable (Remarkable Gardens of France) .

Its name came from the Latin word Oppidum from the Gallo-Roman hilltop fortress towns of the region. The first castle had an interior court surrounded by five towers, three of which still stand. In the 12th century a taller square castle keep with crenelation replaced one of the corner towers. The castle was captured by the English in 1381, then recaptured in 1393 by Marechal Boucicault and Marechal Sancerre. In 1613, the castle became the property of Antoine de Ribeyre, the treasurer of France under the very young King Louis XIII. Ribeyre transformed it from a fortress into an elegant residence in the style of the period; he built a ceremonial entrance, an interior stairway, and large windows, and created ornamental gardens on two terraces overlooking the valley. In 1940 and 1941, the castle was the home and later hiding place of General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, a hero of the Free French Army. During the German occupation, he established a school for officers for the new French army. in Opme, and later escaped France to join the Free French forces of General DeGaulle.

The sources of Sharia also include Islamic scholarly consensus developed after Muhammad's death. Its interpretation by judges in Saudi Arabia is influenced by the medieval texts of the literalist Hanbali school of Islamic jurisprudence. Uniquely in the Muslim world, Sharia has been adopted by Saudi Arabia in an uncodified form. This, and the lack of judicial precedent, has resulted in considerable uncertainty in the scope and content of the country's laws. The government therefore announced its intention to codify Sharia in 2010, and, in 2018, a sourcebook of legal principles and precedents was published by the Saudi government. Sharia has also been supplemented by regulations (Arabic: \\"an·∫ìima,\\" although translated by the Saudi Official Bureau of Translation as \\"Laws\\") issued by royal decree covering modern issues such as intellectual property and corporate law. Nevertheless, Sharia remains the primary source of law, especially in areas such as criminal, family, commercial and contract law, and the Qur'an and the Sunnah are declared to be the country's constitution. In the areas of land and energy law the extensive proprietorial rights of the Saudi state (in effect, the Saudi royal family) constitute a significant feature. The current Saudi court system was created by King Abdul Aziz, who founded the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932, and was introduced to the country in stages between 1927 and 1960. It comprises general and summary Sharia courts, with some administrative tribunals to deal with disputes on specific modern regulations. Trials in Saudi Arabia are bench trials. Courts in Saudi Arabia observe few formalities and the country's first criminal procedure code, issued in 2001, has been largely ignored. King Abdullah, in 2007, introduced a number of significant judicial reforms, although they are yet to be fully implemented. Criminal law punishments in Saudi Arabia include public beheading, stoning, amputation and lashing. Serious criminal offences include not only internationally recognized crimes such as murder, rape, theft and robbery, but also apostasy, adultery, witchcraft and sorcery. In addition to the regular police force, Saudi Arabia has a secret police, the Mabahith, and \\"religious police\\", the Mutawa. The latter enforces Islamic social and moral norms, but their powers have greatly been restricted over the last few years. Western-based human rights organizations, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have criticized the activities of both the Mabahith and the Mutawa, as well as a number of other aspects of human rights in Saudi Arabia. These include the number of executions, the range of offences which are subject to the death penalty, the lack of safeguards for the accused in the criminal justice system, the treatment of homosexuals, the use of torture, the lack of religious freedom, and the highly disadvantaged position of women. The Albert Shanker Institute and Freedom House have also reported that \\"Saudi Arabia's practices diverge from the concept of the rule of law.\\" History Abdul Aziz Al Saud, first king of Saudi Arabia, and founder of the country's court system. Sharia (or Islamic law), the primary source of law in modern Saudi Arabia, was developed gradually by Muslim judges and scholars between the seventh and tenth centuries. From the time of the Abbasid Caliphate in the 8th century, the developing Sharia was accepted as the basis of law in the towns of the Muslim world, including the Arabian Peninsula, and upheld by local rulers, eclipsing urf (or pre-Islamic local customary law). In the rural areas, urf continued to be predominant for some time, and, for instance, was the main source of law among the bedouin of Nejd in central Arabia until the early 20th century. By the 11th century, the Muslim world had developed four major Sunni schools of Islamic jurisprudence (or fiqh), each with its own interpretations of Sharia: Hanbali, Maliki, Shafi and Hanafi. In Arabia, a preference for the Hanbali school was advocated by the Wahhabi movement, founded in the 18th century. Wahhabism, a strict form of Sunni Islam, was supported by the Saudi royal family (the Al Saud) and is now dominant in Saudi Arabia. From the 18th century, the Hanbali school therefore predominated in Nejd and central Arabia, the heartland of Wahhabi Islam. In the more cosmopolitan Hejaz, in the west of the peninsula, both the Hanafi and Shafi schools were followed. Similarly, different court systems existed. In Nejd, there was a simple system of single judges for each of the major towns. The judge was appointed by the local governor, with whom he worked closely to dispose of cases. In the Hejaz, there was a more sophisticated system, with courts comprising panels of judges. In 1925, Abdul Aziz Al Saud of Nejd conquered the Hejaz and united it with his existing territories to form the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932. In 1927, the king introduced a new court system to the Hejaz comprising general and summary courts and ordered that Hanbali fiqh should be used. However, Nejd's traditional system of judges was left in place in the face of conservative opposition from the Nejd religious establishment. After becoming familiar with the Hejaz court system in the following decades, the religious establishment allowed its introduction to the rest of the country between 1957 and 1960. Additionally, from the 1930s, Abdul Aziz created government tribunals or \\"committees\\" to adjudicate in areas covered by royal decrees such as commercial or labor law. The system of Sharia courts and government tribunals created by Abdul Aziz largely remained in place until the 2007 judiciary reforms (see below). Until 1970, the judiciary was the responsibility of the Grand Mufti, the country's most senior religious authority. When the incumbent Grand Mufti died in 1969, however, the then king, Faisal decided not to appoint a successor and took the opportunity to transfer responsibility to the newly established Ministry of Justice. The Shia community of the Eastern province have a separate legal tradition. Although they follow Sharia, they apply the Shia Jafari school of jurisprudence to it. In 1913, when Abdul Aziz conquered the area, he granted the Shias a separate judiciary for dealing with religious and family law cases: one judge in Qatif, and one in Al-Hasa. This remained the position, with the two judges ministering to a population of around two million, until 2005 when the number of judges was increased to seven. For all other areas of law, the Shia community are under the jurisdiction of the regular Sunni courts. Sources of law Verses from the Quran, a primary source of the law of Saudi Arabia. The primary source of law in Saudi Arabia is the Islamic Sharia. Sharia is derived from the Qur'an and the traditions of Muhammad contained in the Sunnah; ijma, or scholarly consensus on the meaning of the Qur'an and the Sunnah developed after Muhammad's death; and Qiyas, or analogical reasoning applied to the principles of the Qur'an, Sunnah and ijma. The Wahhabi interpretation of Islam used in Saudi Arabia uses qiyas only in cases of \\"extreme necessity\\".DeLong- Bas, Wahhabi Islam, 2004: 96 Muslim countries that retain or adopt Sharia usually determine which parts of the Sharia are enforceable and codify (and thereby modernize) them. Unlike other Muslim countries, Saudi Arabia regards uncodified Sharia in its entirety as the law of the land and does not interfere with it. It is, therefore, unique not only when compared to Western systems, but also in comparison to other Muslim countries, and according to one source is the closest system in the modern world to the form of Sharia adopted at the advent of Islam. The lack of codification of Sharia leads to considerable variation in its interpretation and application. Furthermore, there is no system of judicial precedent, as Wahhabism rejects the imitation of past scholarship (taqlid) in favor of independent reasoning (ijtihad).DeLong-Bas, Wahhabi Islam, 2004: 100 However Saudi judges are expected to consult six medieval texts from the Hanbali school of jurisprudence before reaching a decision. The Hanbali school is noted for its literalist interpretation of the Qur'an and hadith. If the answer is not found in the six Hanbali texts, the judge may then consult the jurisprudence of the other three main Sunni schools or apply his independent judgment and legal reasoning, referred to as ijtihad. Nevertheless, because the judge is empowered to disregard previous judgments (either his own or of other judges) and can apply his personal interpretation of Sharia to any particular case through ijtihad, divergent judgements arise even in apparently identical cases. There is a presumption against overturning a decision when it is based on ijtihad. This principle is crucial in two respects. Firstly, it concentrates the substance of the law in the hands of judges as, in consequence, there is a presumption that only a judge exercising ijtihad, rather than a king or a parliament, can determine God's law. Secondly, it renders a judge's decision practically immune to reversal on appeal. The role of ijtihad has led to calls for the Sharia to be codified to give clarity and remove uncertainty. As a result, in 2010, the Minister of Justice announced plans to implement a codification of Sharia law, although resistance from the religious establishment is reportedly delaying its implementation. Royal decrees (nizam) are the other main source of law but are referred to as regulations rather than laws to indicate that they are subordinate to the Sharia. Royal decrees supplement Sharia in areas such as labor, commercial and corporate law. Additionally, other forms of regulations (lai'hah) include Royal Orders, Council of Ministers Resolutions, Ministerial Resolutions and, Ministerial Circulars, and are similarly subordinate to Sharia. Any Western commercial laws or institutions are adapted and interpreted from the standpoint of Shariah law.Coulson, Noel J. (Graham and Trotman, 1984), Commercial Law in the Gulf States: The Islamic Legal Tradition, 3 Additionally, traditional tribal law and custom remain significant. For example, judges will enforce tribal customs pertaining to marriage and divorce. The courts and the judiciary Court structure The Sharia court system constitutes the basic judiciary of Saudi Arabia and its judges and lawyers form part of the ulema, the country's religious leadership. There are also extra-Sharia government tribunals which handle disputes relating to specific royal decrees and since 2008, specialist courts, including the Board of Grievances and the Specialized Criminal Court. Final appeal from both Sharia courts and government tribunals is to the King and , all courts and tribunals followed Sharia rules of evidence and procedure. The Sharia courts have general jurisdiction over most civil and criminal cases. At present, there are two types of courts of first instance: general courts and summary courts dealing with lesser cases. Cases are adjudicated by single judges, except criminal cases if the potential sentence is death, amputation or stoning when there is a panel of three judges. There are also two courts for the Shia minority in the Eastern Province dealing with family and religious matters. Appellate courts sit in Mecca and Riyadh and review decisions for compliance with Sharia. The Supreme Judicial Council of Saudi Arabia supervises the lower courts and provides legal opinions and advice to the King and reviews sentences of death, stoning, and amputation. There are also non- Sharia courts covering specialized areas of law, the most important of which is the Board of Grievances. This court was originally created to deal with complaints against the government, but also has jurisdiction over commercial and some criminal cases, such as bribery and forgery, and acts as a court of appeal for a number of non-Sharia government tribunals. These administrative tribunals, referred to as \\"committees\\", deal with specific issues regulated by royal decrees, such as labor and commercial law. Judges The judicial establishment, in the broadest sense, is composed of qadis, who give binding judgements in specific court cases, and muftis and other members of the ulema, who issue generalized but highly influential legal opinions (fatwas). The Grand Mufti is the most senior member of the judicial establishment as well as being the highest religious authority in the country; his opinions are highly influential among the Saudi judiciary. The judiciary proper (that is, the body of qadis) is composed of about 700 judges, a relatively small number (according to critics) for a country of over 23 million. Qadis generally have degrees in Sharia law from an Islamic university recognized by the Saudi government with, in many cases, a post-graduate qualification from the Institute of Higher Judiciary in Riyadh. The training received from such Sharia law degrees is entirely religious in character and is based on the Qur'an and centuries old religious treatises with no reference to, for example, modern commercial issues. Although most judges have been educated and appointed under the current system, some of the older judges received the traditional qadi's training of years of instruction by a religious mentor in a mosque. The capabilities and reactionary nature of the judges have been criticized. The main complaint reportedly made by Saudis privately is that judges, who have wide discretion in interpreting the Sharia, have no knowledge, and are often contemptuous, of the modern world. Reported examples of judges' attitudes include rulings banning such things as the children‚Äôs game Pok√©mon, telephones that play recorded music, and sending flowers to hospital patients. Saudi judges come from a narrow recruitment pool. By one estimate, 80% of the 600+ Saudi judges and almost all senior judges come from Qasim, a province in the center of the country with less than 5% of Saudi's population,Preliminary results of census of 2004-09-15 but known as the strict religious Wahhabi heartland of Saudi Arabia. Senior judges will only allow like-minded graduates of select religious institutes to join the judiciary and will remove judges that stray away from rigidly conservative judgments. Reforms and developments 2008‚Äì2018 The Saudi system of justice has been criticized for being slow, arcane, lacking in some of the safeguards of justice and unable to deal with the modern world. In 2007, King Abdullah issued royal decrees with the aim of reforming the judiciary and creating a new court system. With the launch of labor courts on November 25, 2018, the reforms have been completed, including the creation of the Supreme Court and the transfer of the Board of Grievances' commercial and criminal jurisdictions to the general court system. The specialist first instance courts now comprise general, criminal, personal status, commercial and labor courts. The Sharia courts have therefore lost their general jurisdiction to hear all cases and the work load of the government's administrative tribunals have been transferred to the new courts. Another important change is the establishment of appeal courts for each province. It has been claimed that the reforms will establish a system for codifying Sharia and incorporating the principle of judicial precedent into court practice. King Abdullah ordered a number of reforms of the judiciary during his reignSignificant progress has been made with the publication, on January 3, 2018, of a sourcebook of legal principles and precedents. In 2008, the Specialized Criminal Court was created. The court tries suspected terrorists and human rights activists. On 26 June 2011, the court started trials of 85 people suspected of being involved in Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the 2003 Riyadh compound bombings, and in September 2011 another 41 al-Qaeda suspects appeared in the court. In the same year, the court held trial sessions of human rights activists, including Mohammed Saleh al-Bejadi, co-founder of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA) and Mubarak Zu'air, a lawyer for long-term prisoners, and a protester, Khaled al-Johani, who spoke to BBC Arabic Television at a protest in Riyadh. The court convicted 16 of the human rights activists to sentences of 5‚Äì30 years on 22 November 2011. In 2009, the King made a number of significant changes to the judiciary's personnel at the most senior level by bringing in a younger generation. For example, as well as appointing a new Minister of Justice, a new chairman of the Supreme Judicial Council was appointed. The outgoing chairman was known to oppose the codification of Sharia. The king also appointed a new head of the Board of Grievances and Abdulrahman Al Kelya as the first chief justice of the new Supreme Court. As of January 2013 royal decree, the Supreme Judicial Council will be headed by the justice minister. The chief justice of the Supreme Court will also be a member. Law enforcement The police department of the Saudi Ministry of the Interior is divided into three forces: the regular police, secret police and the religious police. Regular and secret police A police vehicle in Saudi Arabia The Department of Public Safety is the official name of the regular police force and handles most day-to-day police activities. It is a highly centralized force and is usually headed by a member of the royal family. The \\"secret police\\", or Mabahith, deals with domestic security and counter-intelligence. It runs the  ΩUlaysha Prison in Riyadh, where it holds its prisoners. The United Nations' Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has objected to arbitrary detention by the Mabahith at  ΩUlaysha. Mutawa The religious police, (mutawa is the name used for individual religious police, the \\"Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice\\" is the name of the police organization) enforce Islamic codes of behavior. Numbering about 20,000 men untrained in law enforcement, the mutawa ensure that there is strict separation of the sexes in public, that businesses close at prayer time, pressure women to wear traditional dress and, in some areas, prevent them from driving cars. Often accompanied by a police escort, the mutawa could order the detention and arrest of \\"violators\\". Criticism of the mutawa by Saudis has grown since 2002, when 15 schoolgirls died in a fire at their school in Mecca after the mutawa allegedly prevented male rescuers from entering because the girls were not veiled. On 13 April 2016, a new regulation issued by the Saudi cabinet stripped the mutawa of their authority for pursuit, capture, interrogation or detainment of suspects, instead requiring them to report suspected crimes to the regular police. Major areas of law Constitutional law The Qur'an, declared to be Saudi Arabia's constitution Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy, and has no legally binding written constitution. However, in 1992, the Basic Law of Saudi Arabia was adopted by royal decree. The Basic Law outlines the responsibilities and processes of the governing institutions but is insufficiently specific to be considered a constitution. It declares that the king must comply with Sharia (that is, Islamic law) and that the Quran and the Sunna (the traditions of Muhammad) are the country's constitution. Interpretation of the Quran and the Sunna remains necessary, and this is carried out by the ulema, the Saudi religious establishment. The Basic Law further states: ::Monarchy is the system of rule in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Rulers of the country shall be from amongst the sons of the founder King Abdulaziz bin Abdulrahman Al-Faisal Al-Saud, and their descendants. The most upright among them shall receive allegiance according to Almighty God's Book and His Messenger's Sunna (Traditions)...Government in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia derives its authority from the Book of God and the Sunna of the Prophet (PBUH), which are the ultimate sources of reference for this Law and the other laws of the State...Governance in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is based on justice, shura (consultation) and equality according to Islamic Sharia. Criminal law Saudi Arabia uses the bench trial system. Its courts observe few formalities. The country's first criminal procedure code was introduced in 2001 and contains provisions borrowed from Egyptian and French law. Human Rights Watch, in a 2008 report, noted that judges were either ignorant of the criminal procedure code or were aware of it but routinely ignored the code. Criminal law is governed by Sharia and comprises three categories: hudud (fixed Quranic punishments for specific crimes), Qisas (eye-for-an-eye retaliatory punishments), and Tazir, a general category. Hudud crimes are the most serious and include theft, robbery, blasphemy, apostasy, adultery, sodomy and fornication. Qisas crimes include murder or any crime involving bodily harm. Tazir represents most cases, many of which are defined by national regulations such as bribery, trafficking, and drug abuse. The most common punishment for a Tazir offence is lashing. A conviction requires proof in one of three ways. The first is an uncoerced confession. Alternatively, the testimony of two male witnesses can convict (four in the case of adultery), unless it is a hudud crime, in which case a confession is also required. Women's evidence normally carries half the weight of men in Sharia courts, however in criminal trials women's testimony is not allowed at all. Testimony from non-Muslims or Muslims whose doctrines are considered unacceptable (for example, Shia) may be discounted. Lastly, an affirmation or denial by oathThe Muslim oath has no prescribed form except that it must begin \\"Wallahi, Wabillahi, Watallah\\" (\\"By God...\\"). It is not necessary to place the hand on the Qur'an, although this is often done. See can be required. Giving an oath is taken particularly seriously in a religious society such as Saudi Arabia's, and a refusal to take an oath will be taken as an admission of guilt resulting in conviction. Deera Square, central Riyadh. Known locally as \\"Chop-chop square\\", it is the location of public beheadings. The Saudi courts impose a number of severe physical punishments. The death penalty can be imposed for a wide range of offences including murder, rape, armed robbery, repeated drug use, apostasy, adultery, witchcraft and sorcery and can be carried out by beheading with a sword, stoning or firing squad, followed by crucifixion. The 345 reported executions between 2007 and 2010 were all carried out by public beheading.U.S. State Department Annual Human Rights Reports for Saudi Arabia 2007-2010: ; ; ; Two executions for \\"witchcraft and sorcery\\" were carried out in 2011. There were no reports of stoning between 2007 and 2010. Stoning has, however, occurred relatively recently and, for example, between 1981 and 1992 there were four cases of execution by stoning reported. In April 2020, Saudi Arabia excluded minors who commit crimes from facing execution, but instead would get sentenced a maximum of 10 years in a juvenile detention facility. Although repeated theft can be punishable by amputation of the right hand and aggravated theft by the cross-amputation of a hand and a foot, only one instance of judicial amputation was reported between 2007 and 2010. Homosexual acts are punishable by flogging, imprisonment or death. Lashings are a common form of punishment and are often imposed for offences against religion and public morality such as drinking alcohol and neglect of prayer and fasting obligations. In April 2020, the Saudi Supreme Court eliminated the punishment of flogging from its court system, and replaced it by fines, jail time, or both. Retaliatory punishments, or Qisas, are practised: for instance, an eye can be surgically removed at the insistence of a victim who lost his own eye. This occurred in a case reported in 2000. Families of someone unlawfully killed can choose between demanding the death penalty or granting clemency in return for a payment of diyya, or blood money, by the perpetrator. There has been a growing trend of exorbitant blood-money demands, for example a sum of $11 million was reported as being recently demanded. Saudi officials and religious figures have criticized this trend and said that the practise of diyya has become corrupted. Family law Laws relating to marriage, divorce, children and inheritance are not codified and fall within the general jurisdiction of the Sharia courts. Polygamy is permitted for men but is limited to four wives at any one time. There is evidence that its practice has increased, particularly among the educated Hejazi elite, as a result of oil wealth. The government has promoted polygamy as part of a return to \\"Islamic values\\" program. In 2001, the Grand Mufti (the highest religious authority) issued a fatwa, or opinion, calling upon Saudi women to accept polygamy as part of the Islamic package and declaring that polygamy was necessary \\"to fight against...the growing epidemic of spinsterhood\\". In 2019, marriages under the age of 15 were banned and marriages under the age of 18 would need to be referred to specialialized courts for approval. Prior to that, there was no minimum age for marriage and the Grand Mufti reportedly had said in 2009 that girls of the age of 10 or 12 were marriageable. Men have a unilateral right to divorce their wives (talaq) without needing any legal justification. The divorce is effective immediately. The husband's obligation is then to provide financial support for the divorced wife for a period of four months and ten days. A woman can only obtain a divorce with the consent of her husband or judicially if her husband has harmed her. In practice, it is very difficult for a Saudi woman to obtain a judicial divorce. The divorce rate is high, with 50% of marriages being dissolved. In the event of divorce, fathers have automatic custody of sons from the age of 7 and daughters from the age of 9. The right for men to marry up to four wives, combined with their ability to divorce a wife at any time without cause, can translate to unlimited polygamy. King Abdul Aziz, the founder of the country, reportedly admitted to marrying over two hundred women. However, his polygamy was considered extraordinary even by Saudi Arabian standards. With regard to the law of inheritance, the Quran specifies that fixed portions of the deceased's estate must be left to the so-called \\"Quranic heirs\\". Generally, female heirs receive half the portion of male heirs. A Sunni Muslim can bequeath a maximum of a third of his property to non-Quranic heirs. The residue is divided between agnatic heirs. Commercial and contract law Business and commerce are governed by Sharia, commercial jurisdiction rests with the Board of Grievances composed of Sharia-trained judges, but \\"Special Tribunals\\" tasked with \\"finding ways to circumnavigate the more restrictive aspects of Shariah Law\\" have been established. For foreign investors, uncertainties around the content of commercial law, because of the Sharia aspect, constitutes a disincentive to invest in Saudi Arabia. As it is governed by Sharia, contract law is not codified. Within the general limitations of Sharia, it allows considerable freedom for the parties to agree contract terms. However, contracts involving speculation or the payment of interest are prohibited and are not enforceable. If a contract is breached, Saudi courts will only award compensation for proven direct damage. Claims for loss of profit or opportunity will not be allowed as these would constitute speculation, which is not permitted under Sharia. As of at least 2003, the non-sharia \\"Special Tribunals\\" or \\"Special Committees\\" hear \\"most commercial law cases\\" ranging from \\"breach of contract suits to trade mark infringement and labour disputes.\\" The Tribunals enforce nizam (decrees) issued by the King. Specific modern aspects of commercial law, for example, commercial paper and securities, intellectual property, and corporate law are governed by modern regulations, and specialist government tribunals deal with related disputes. The government recently revised its intellectual property laws to meet World Trade Organization standards, as part of its admission to the WTO in 2004. Because of a lack of resources, when the new patent law went into effect in 2004, the Saudi Patent office had only registered 90 patents since 1989, with a backlog of 9,000 applications. It is believed the backlog has now been reduced. The Saudi government is also putting greater resources into combating unauthorized distribution of software, printed material, recordings and videos. However, illegally copied material is still widely available. Enforcement efforts have been supported by a fatwa, or religious ruling, that copyright infringement of software is forbidden under Islam. Saudi Arabia had been on the Special 301 Watchlist, the U.S.'s running log of countries considered to inadequately regulate or enforce intellectual property rights, but was removed in 2010. Saudi law recognizes only corporate or partnership entities established under Sharia or the Saudi Company Law of 1982. A contract with any other type of company will be void and the persons who made the contract in the company's name will be personally liable for it. Under Sharia, corporations can take a number of forms, but the most common in Saudi Arabia is Sharikat Modarabah where some partners contribute assets and others contribute expertise. In addition, the Company Law (which is based on Egyptian company law) identifies eight permissible forms of corporate entity including joint ventures, and limited liability partnerships. Labor law Employers have a number of obligations, including at least 21 days paid holiday after a year's employment and will be 30 days after five years of continuous service. Terminated employees must receive an \\"end-of-service\\" payment of a half a months' salary for each year employed going up to one month if employed for more than 5 years. Land law Most land in Saudi Arabia is owned by the government and only cultivated land and urban property are subject to individual ownership. All land titles must be registered, but there is no accurate information as to the extent of registration. Real estate could only be owned by Saudi citizens until 2000, when the property laws were amended to allow foreigners to own property in Saudi Arabia. Property investments by non-Saudis of more than 30 million Saudi riyals require approval of the Council of Ministers and foreigners remain prohibited from owning property in Medina and Mecca. Saudi Arabia has three categories of land: developed land (amir), undeveloped land (mawat), and \\"protective zones\\" (harim). Developed land comprises the built environment of towns and villages and agriculturally developed land, and can be bought, sold and inherited by individuals. The undeveloped land comprises rough grazing, pasture and wilderness. Rough grazing and pasture is owned in common and everyone has equal rights to its use. The wilderness is owned by the state and may be open to everyone unless specific restrictions are imposed. Harim land is a protective buffer between the owned land and the undeveloped land, and is defined, in the case of a town, as the area that can be reached and returned from in a day for the purposes of collecting fuel and pasturing livestock. Saudi law utilizes the Waqf, which is a form of land ownership whereby a Muslim can transfer property to a foundation for long-term religious or charitable purposes. The property cannot then be alienated or transferred. Energy law Saudi Aramco's headquarters complex in Dhahran, Eastern Province Saudi Arabia's vast oil reserves are owned by the Saudi government, in effect the Saudi royal family. Article 14 of the Basic Law states: ::All natural resources that God has deposited underground, above ground, in territorial waters or within the land and sea domains under the authority of the State, together with revenues of these resources, shall be the property of the State, as provided by the Law. The Law shall specify means for exploitation, protection and development of these resources in the best interest of the State, and its security and economy. The Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources is responsible for general strategy in the oil and gas sectors and for monitoring the state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco. The oil, gas and refining industries in Saudi Arabia are controlled by law by Saudi Aramco, which has a near monopoly in these areas. It is the world's biggest oil producer, the Middle East's biggest company and is generally considered to be the most important energy company in the world. However, in 2003, the law was changed to allow foreign companies to look for Saudi Arabia's vast reserves of natural gas, believed to represent 4% of the world's reserves. This was the first time since the 1970s that foreign companies have been permitted to search for oil or gas. Currently, the electricity industry is in the hands of the 75% state-owned Saudi Electric Company, but plans have been announced to privatize the industry. Human rights and rule of law issues Human rights issues and failings in the rule of law in Saudi Arabia have attracted strong criticism. These include criminal law punishments that are considered as cruel, as well as the position of women, religious discrimination, the lack of religious freedom and the activities of the Saudi Mutaween. Between 1996 and 2000, Saudi Arabia acceded to four UN human rights conventions and, in 2004, the government approved the establishment of the National Society for Human Rights (NSHR), staffed by government employees, to monitor their implementation. To date, the activities of the NSHR have been limited and doubts remain over its neutrality and independence. Saudi Arabia was one of only eight countries that did not accept the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights when it was launched in 1948. Now, only Saudi Arabia remains openly opposed to the declaration. In response to the continuing criticism of its human rights record, the Saudi government points to the special Islamic character of the country, and asserts that this justifies a different social and political order. Rule of law Because Sharia, as applied by Saudi courts, is uncodified and because judges are not bound by judicial precedent, the scope and content of the law is uncertain. A study published by the Albert Shanker Institute and Freedom House has criticized a number of aspects of the administration of justice in Saudi Arabia and concluded that the country's \\"practices diverge from the concept of the rule of law.\\" The study goes on to assert that qadis (judges) reach decisions without following due process and \\"only the bravest of lawyers ... challenge decisions of the qadis; usually appeals to the king are based on mercy, not on justice or innocence.\\" It also claimed that members of the Saudi royal family are not forced to appear before Saudi courts. As in many countries, those with influence may receive favorable treatment before the law. According to a former managing editor at Arab News, the ruling House of Saud is so unwilling \\"to let one of their own face the consequences of his criminal activity\\" that on the rare occasions that they are arrested for a crime, the perpetrating prince is pardoned (Prince Fahd bin Naif, who was 19, gunned down Mundir al-Qadi in 2002) or released, and further media mention of the incident forbidden by the Ministry of Culture and Information (four princes that participated in the disruption of a 2002 Eid al-Fitr gathering on the corniche of Jeddah). On the other hand, blue collar foreign workers have sometimes been unable to collect salaries due even when the Saudi Labor Office has ruled in their favor, since employers can stall payment until the worker' work permits have expired. Women's rights A Saudi woman wearing a traditional niqƒÅb The U.S. State department considers that ‚Äúdiscrimination against women is a significant problem‚Äù in Saudi Arabia and that women have few political or social rights. After her 2008 visit, the UN special rapporteur on violence against women noted the lack of women's autonomy and the absence of a law criminalizing violence against women. The World Economic Forum 2012 Global Gender Gap Report ranked Saudi Arabia 131st out of 135 countries for gender parity, ahead of Syria, Chad, Pakistan and Yemen. Every adult woman has to have a close male relative as her \\"guardian\\". As a result, Human Rights Watch has described the position of Saudi women as no different from being a minor, with little authority over their own lives. The guardian is entitled to make a number of critical decisions on a woman's behalf. These include giving approval for the woman to hold some types of business licenses, to study at a university or college and to work if the type of business is not \\"deemed appropriate for a woman.\\" Even where a guardian‚Äôs approval is not legally required, some officials will still ask for it. However, the Saudi guardianship system was abolished in August 2019, allowing women to travel and own businesses without the need of a guardian's approval. Women also face discrimination in the courts, where the testimony of one man equals that of two women, and in family and inheritance law (see above). Women formerly required permission to obtain a passport and travel. This restriction was removed on July 26, 2019. Crown Prince Mohammed also extended to women the right to receive equal treatment in the workplace and to obtain family documents from the government in August 2019. The religious police mutawa impose restrictions on women when in public. These restrictions include requiring women to sit in separate specially designated family sections in restaurants, to wear an abaya (a loose-fitting, full-length black cloak covering the entire body) and to conceal their hair. Women also risk arrest for riding in a vehicle driven by a male who is not an employee or a close male relative. Although there was no written ban on women driving cars, it was previously effectively illegal for women to drive cars in Saudi Arabia, as a Saudi driving license is required by law and these were not issued to women. . Driving licenses started being issued to women in June 2018, and the effective ban was lifted on the 24th of June 2018. In 2013, Saudi Arabia registered its first female trainee lawyer, Arwa al-Hujaili. Political freedom and freedom of speech No political parties or national elections are permitted in Saudi Arabia and according to The Economist's 2010 Democracy Index, the Saudi government is the seventh most authoritarian regime from among the 167 countries rated. There is no legal protection of freedom of speech and people are prohibited from publicly criticizing the government, Islam, or the royal family. The Saudi press is strictly censored and articles on Saudi dissidents are banned. Saudi censorship is considered among the most restrictive in the world and the country blocks broad swathes of the Internet. After protests occurred in early 2011, the government banned all public demonstrations and marches. Criminal trials and punishment Western-based organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have condemned both the Saudi criminal justice system and its severe punishments. However, most Saudis reportedly support the system and say that it maintains a low crime rate. Human Rights Watch, in their 2008 report on Saudi Arabian criminal justice system, noted that the criminal procedure code introduced in 2002 lacked some basic protections but, as mentioned above, had been ignored by judges in any case. Those arrested are often not informed of the crime of which they are accused or given access to a lawyer and are subject to abusive treatment and torture if they do not confess. At trial, there is a presumption of guilt and the accused is often unable to examine witnesses and evidence or present a legal defense. Most trials are held in secret, that is, without the public or press. The physical punishments imposed by Saudi courts, such as beheading, stoning, amputation and lashing, and the number of executions have also been strongly criticized. Saudi Arabia has been condemned by various international organizations for its discriminatory legal system towards the guilty. In June 2017, Saudi officials were accused of illegally transferring a Saudi student studying in the US, who was accused of killing a teenager in Oregon. The accused faced first-degree manslaughter - with a minimum sentence of 10 years - as well as hit-and-run, reckless endangerment and reckless driving charges in the US. As per a report by BBC, Saudi authorities helped him obtain an illegal passport and fled him out of the States in a private plane. In June 2018, Saudi officials informed the US that the student was in the kingdom from the past one year. Saudi Arabia has made bail for its nationals on several previous occasions as well, including for a man accused of rape in Utah in 2015, who also fled, and in 2013 for a Missouri resident, who was accused but later acquitted of murdering a person. Religious freedom In 2010, the U.S. State Department stated that in Saudi Arabia \\"freedom of religion is neither recognized nor protected under the law and is severely restricted in practice\\" and that \\"government policies continued to place severe restrictions on religious freedom\\". No faith other than Islam is permitted to be practised, although there are nearly a million Christians, nearly all foreign workers, in Saudi Arabia. There are no churches or other non-Muslim houses of worship permitted in the country. Even private prayer services are forbidden in practice and the Saudi religious police reportedly regularly search the homes of Christians. Foreign workers must observe Ramadan and are not allowed to celebrate Christmas or Easter. Conversion by Muslims to another religion (apostasy) carries the death penalty, although there have been no confirmed reports of executions for apostasy in recent years. Proselytizing by non- Muslims is illegal, and the last Christian priest was expelled from Saudi Arabia in 1985. Compensation in court cases discriminates against non-Muslims: once fault is determined, a Muslim receives all of the amount of compensation determined, a Jew or Christian half, and all others a sixteenth. According to Human Rights Watch, the Shia minority face systematic discrimination from the Saudi government in education, the justice system and especially religious freedom. Restrictions are imposed on the public celebration of Shia festivals such as Ashura and on the Shia taking part in communal public worship. In March 2014, the Saudi interior ministry issued a royal decree branding all atheists as terrorists, which defines terrorism as \\"calling for atheist thought in any form, or calling into question the fundamentals of the Islamic religion on which this country is based\\".\\"Saudi Arabia declares all atheists are terrorists in new law to crack down on political dissidents\\" Independent, April 2014 LGBT rights Saudi Arabia is one of the few countries in the world where homosexual acts are not only illegal but punishable by execution. There have also been raids on \\"gay parties\\" and men have been arrested for \\"behaving like women\\". The usual penalties inflicted have been limited to flogging and imprisonment. However, in 2020, the Saudi Supreme court abolished the flogging punishment.

The game, played at Croke Park in Dublin, culminated in one of the most famous goals of all time. Kerry entered the match heavy favourites to complete an unprecedented five consecutive All-Ireland Senior Football Championship titles, having won for the previous four years in a run stretching back to 1978. Their opponents Offaly had not won an All-Ireland Senior Football Championship title since 1972. Kerry and Offaly had met in the 1980 semi-final and the 1981 final, Kerry emerging as victors on both occasions. Indeed, Kerry had not lost a championship game since the 1977 semi- final. However, this time, a last-minute S√©amus Darby goal ‚Äî struck past the hapless Charlie Nelligan ‚Äî deprived Kerry of their five-in-a-row dream.High Ball magazine, issue #6, 1998. They had to put away their \\"Five in a Row\\" song, which had been prepared especially for the occasion. Match The 1982 Offaly team had five sets of brothers: the Lowrys (Mick, Se√°n and Brendan), the Fitzgeralds (Mick and Pat), the Darbys (S√©amus and Stephen) and two sets of Connors brothers (Liam and Thomas, Matt and Richie). Kerry had a one-point lead in the second half when referee P. J. McGrath awarded a penalty against Offaly. Mikey Sheehy stepped up to take the spot kick. He was facing the Canal End of Croke Park. Sheehy had been having a poor game, unable to detach himself from the attention of Mick Fitzgerald. Offaly goalkeeper Martin Furlong, playing his 56th championship match for his county, yelled at the Offaly backs to pay heed to a possible rebound. Furlong met Sheehy's strike, a ball hit about four feet high, with the palm of his hand. Pat Fitzgerald collected the rebound. Offaly were away, and Johnny Mooney scored a point to bring the teams level. Soon, though, Kerry acquired a four-point lead. Offaly kept with Kerry, however. Eugene McGee and his selectors opted to send S√©amus Darby onto the field of play as a substitute, with instructions to stay forward and try for a goal. Darby arrived onto the field as a replacement for John Guinan with seven minutes left to play. Kerry were winning by two points with two minutes to go. Eoin Liston conceded a free after knocking over Pat Fitzgerald in the middle of the field. Darby got behind his marker Tommy Doyle and caught a \\"high, lobbing, dropping ball\\". He struck the ball with his left foot past the hapless Charlie Nelligan into the goalkeeper's top left corner, scoring one of the most famous goals of all time. It was his only kick of the match. The referee played 45 seconds of additional time. Tom Spillane ran along the Hogan Stand side of Croke Park only to lose the ball to Se√°n Lowry. Furlong ran to gather the ball and sent a handpass in the direction of Brendan Lowry. Sheehy got the ball instead, sending it across Furlong's goal. Se√°n Lowry, beneath it, awaited its descent. He later said: \\"I remember thinking if I catch it over my head and the Bomber [Liston] comes in and drives it into the back of the net, it's all for nothing. Imagine all these things came into my head. I was catching it in my chest and just then, when it was still a good bit up, 'You're on your own Jack', someone behind me shouted. Paudie Lynch was nearby. Never came. Never jumped. Eoin Liston could have got there no problem. They were just shell shocked\\". Se√°n Lowry caught the ball. The referee blew the final whistle, with Lowry still in possession. Offaly had won by a single point on a scoreline of 1‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì17. Details Post-match S√©amus Darby's goal The five-in-a-row was not achieved. Martin Furlong was named Footballer of the Year. Martin Breheny interviewed the players from both teams in their dressing rooms. Journalists were permitted to do so at the time, though the practice would later cease. Breheny later recalled sitting next to Jack O'Shea as he tried to make sense of what had just occurred on the field. Pat Spillane locked himself into a toilet and wept. This remains the last occasion on which Offaly won an All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. Kerry reached the 1983 Munster Senior Football Championship final, where opponents Cork denied them victory with another late goal, scored by Tadhg Murphy, meaning Kerry did not even make that year's All-Ireland semi-final. This appeared to signal the end for this Kerry team. In 2005, RT√â named Darby's goal as one of the Top 20 GAA Moments. The expression \\"to do a S√©amus Darby\\" has been used in other fields. The match received renewed attention in 2010 when the Kilkenny hurlers were aiming to complete their own five-in-a- row, also never realised. In 2018, Martin Breheny listed this as the greatest All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final.Breheny, Martin. \\"Martin Breheny's Greatest All-Ireland Finals\\". Irish Independent. 1 September 2018, p. 4‚Äì5. Radio Kerry played the Five in a Row song in 2018 when the minor team did what the 1982 side could not. Loosehorse produced a documentary, Players of the Faithful, which debuted on RT√â on 28 December 2018. An episode of Laochra Gael focusing on Darby and titled \\"An Fear a Sc√≥r√°il an C√∫l\\" (\\"The Man Who Got the Goal\\") first aired on TG4 in 2019. Offaly released a 1982 replica jersey in 2019. The match again received great attention in 2019 as Dublin prepared for their own attempt at a five-in-a-row, having ‚Äî in 2018 ‚Äî become the first team since Kerry in 1981 to win four consecutive titles. By coincidence, the golfer Shane Lowry ‚Äî son of Brendan and nephew of Se√°n and Mick ‚Äî won the 2019 Open Championship during that Championship season, doing so as the Munster and Ulster champions, Kerry and Donegal, played out an entertaining draw in Croke Park, a day after Dublin hammered Connacht champions Roscommon at the same venue. After Dublin's successful five-in-a- row, S√©amus Darby declared Dublin as superior to any of Mick O'Dwyer's Kerry teams, writing in the Sunday Independent: \\"Dublin played out the last 10 minutes [of the 2019 final replay] like the Harlem Globetrotters. It was exhibition stuff\\".

From 1993 until 2003, he starred in the successful sitcom \\"Het Zonnetje in Huis\\" along his son John Kraaijkamp Jr. Early life Kraaijkamp was one of four children of a greengrocer and a housecleaner. He grew up in the Kinkerbuurt in Amsterdam. After an accident, his father was declared unfit for work and Johnny had to find work at a young age. At the age of 14, he already performed as a boy soprano in the famous Amsterdam theatre Carr√©. Career With Rijk de Gooyer Kraaijkamp worked for a short while as acrobat, but then moved on to become a singer in a show orchestra. He performed as an entertainer and bass player in local bars, where he was discovered in the 1950s by Rijk de Gooyer. Together they recorded the song \\"Twee jongens op een gitaar\\" (Two guys on a guitar). It was the start of a long and successful partnership. John (then \\"Johnny\\") and Rijk began to perform together on radio and television. In spring 1956, they joined the \\"Weekendshow\\", an entertainment show from the broadcasting company AVRO which also included comedians Huub Matron and later Ren√© van Vooren. They also toured with the Snip & Snap Revue and perform in several comedy plays written for TV, together and apart. In 1962, they got together again for Open het dorp, an extremely well-watched TV benefit marathon presented by Mies Bouwman, in which they performed in their pyjamas. In the 1960s and 1970s they performed regularly together on Dutch TV. In 1964, they began with the Johnny & Rijk shows (later called 'n Paar Apart). In 1968, they presented another \\"Weekendhow\\". In all these shows, Rijk was the \\"feeder\\" and John the comedian. Even when they worked apart, they held close contact.

The duo also recorded a couple of hit singles, including \\"De Bostella\\", for which they received a golden record in 1968. From 1970 to 1971, they even had a show on German TV, Spass durch Zwei. Solo work In 1973, De Gooyer started a film career. Kraaijkamp didn't sit still, and made a couple of shows for the NCRV, with Tonny Huurdeman as his new feeder. Unfortunately, these were not very successful: the show only lasted three episodes. The TROS later produced a new series of Johnny Kraaijkamp Shows. De Gooyer performs in two episodes. In 1985, he joined old partner De Gooyer in the AVRO TV series De Brekers, which also starred Ad√®le Bloemendaal and Sacco van der Made. He also played in a couple of movies in the 1970s and 1980s, including Jos Stelling's De Wisselwachter and Fons Rademakers' The Assault (both 1986), as the bittered resistance fighter Cor Takes, and Iris (1987), with Monique van de Ven.

In 1984 he won the Louis d'Or, the most prestigious award in stage acting in The Netherlands, for his lead role in Jacques de fatalist en zijn meester. Later years From 1988 until 1990, he starred in the prison sitcom Laat maar zitten, based on the British TV series Porridge. His most successful role in recent years was the part of Piet Boverkerk in the RTL comedy series Het zonnetje in huis (1993‚Äì2003). In the show, he played a pig- headed old man that comes to live with his son and daughter-in-law (played by his own son, John Kraaijkamp Jr., and Martine Bijl) after his wife died. He continued to perform in various plays, including The Sunshine Boys (1994), along with his son, Harold Pinter's The Homecoming (2001), and Gouwe Handjes (2002‚Äì2003), which was written especially for him by Haye van der Heyden. In 2000, theater producer Joop van den Ende named a musical award after him. The John Kraaijkamp Musical Awards are awarded every year to musical actors and actresses.

Four players (three representing Dublin, one representing Galway) were sent off, earning the Dublin team the epithet \\"The Dirty Dozen\\". The game was marred by scenes of thuggery and ugliness. Galway had also lost to Dublin in their previous All-Ireland football final appearance in 1974. Earlier in the game, Barney Rock had scored an 11th-minute goal, but all was overshadowed by what followed. Route to the final Both Dublin and Galway were fortunate to have reached the final at all, as both needed late goals in the semi-finals to stay in the championship. Dublin salvaged a draw with Cork thanks to a Barney Rock goal in injury time before beating them in a memorable replay in P√°irc U√≠ Chaoimh. That replay was the first time an All-Ireland semi-final had been held outside Croke Park since 1941. Galway overcame an unfortunate Donegal with a Val Joyce strike. Supporters anticipated an eventful game. Both counties had a proud footballing tradition, and this was also the first final since 1977 that did not involve Kerry. Match Summary Conditions were terrible on the day of the match, with a gale-force wind and driving rain making it impossible for the players to play constructive football, and the physical battle was more intense than usual. The game was full of dangerous sliding tackles and players involved themselves in many heated exchanges. It is impossible to locate the exact source of the disgraceful scenes which marred the final. There was no history of violence in previous clashes between the sides. Dublin's Barney Rock scored a bizarre goal from 40 yards after a poor free-out from Galway goalkeeper P√°draig Coyne. Galway objected. They claimed the goal should not have been allowed due to Dublin manager Kevin Heffernan interfering with play as he tended to the injured Joe McNally. Referee John Gough did not agree and the goal stood. Soon after that, things began to go wrong for Dublin. After a tussle in midfield, Dublin legend Brian Mullins swung back his arm and struck Brian Talty, sending him crashing to the ground. The referee promptly sent Mullins off. Mullins said of his assault on Talty: \\"If I look back on it, a lot of thoughts run through my mind. It happened and I had to accept it\\". Shortly before half-time several players clashed beneath the Hogan Stand and, to the crowd's astonishment, referee Gough sent off a player from each side ‚Äî Ray Hazley from Dublin and Tom√°s Tierney of Galway. Stephen Joyce, who was also playing for Galway that day, said: \\"In my view neither player deserved to be given their marching orders\\". The referee blew his whistle to end the first half, which brought a ceasefire of sorts. However, players continued to clash in the tunnel and ‚Äî while rumours circulated for years about the incident ‚Äî word of whatever happened in the tunnel remained there. Galway's Brian Talty did not return for the second half. Val Joyce said Mullins was the perpetrator: \\"Brian Mullins came in after for Brian Talty. I ran in and stood in his way\\". Whatever peace remained was swiftly dispensed with when, five minutes after the restart, Dublin's Kieran Duff lifted his foot towards the face of Pat O Neill, who lay stricken on the ground. The referee promptly sent Duff off. Thus, it was fourteen-man Galway against twelve-man Dublin for most of the second half. Dublin's \\"Dirty Dozen\\", as they were to become known,High Ball magazine, issue #6, 1998. sat back and defended against Galway's forward play. Dublin held out to win the game by a slim margin of just two points (1‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì08). But the circumstances overshadowed the achievement. Details Post-match Martin Breheny interviewed the players from both teams in their dressing rooms. Journalists were permitted to do so at the time, and, on this occasion, were not prevented from going about their business by the dirtiness of the game, though the practice would later cease. While towelling himself down, one of the Dublin men sent off, Kieran Duff, quietly explained to Breheny what had happened: \\"I was provoked. I pleaded my case with the referee, but all he did was take my name and order me off without so much as a how's your father\\". The following morning's newspapers coverage had very little to do with the actual game, but focused on the ugliness of the match and also reported on the poor supervision at exits and the terrible crushing in the Canal End and on Hill 16, where a fan was stabbed. There were reports of clashes amongst supporters after the match and of buses full of Galway fans being stoned as they left Dublin. After the match some Galway officials deemed Dublin to be a squad of hitmen with no regard for decency or fair play. The pressure was on the GAA authorities to act fast and deal with the controversy on the pitch, but it took weeks for the organisation to sort out all the disciplinary matters arising from the final. When the punishments were announced Dublin felt aggrieved believing they were handed far too much of the responsibility for the controversies. Ciaran Duff was banned for 12 months, Brian Mullins for 5 months, their manager Kevin Heffernan received a 3-month ban while Ray Hazley got a month. 2 players from Galway, Tom√°s Tierney and Peter Lee were both suspended for 1 month each. Both county boards were also fined. The entire incident left a sour taste in the mouth of GAA fans, especially those of Galway and Dublin, of which a rivalry between the two was born. They did not meet in the competition again until the 2018 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship semi-final. The match and related incidents was given the Scannal treatment by RT√â in 2007. Hazley auctioned his medal in 2013.

He fought in the Crimean War and became adjutant of his regiment before going to Ceylon and then transferring to the 15th Foot then the Coldstream Guards. Having achieved the rank of colonel, he retired from the Coldstream Guards in 1878 to concentrate on his art work, having learned etching from a fellow officer. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers in 1887. In 1877 he married Beatrice Teresa Testaferrata-Abela, daughter of Baron Testaferrata- Abela of Malta and had a son, Francis who died in 1891. His wife also died and in 1899 he remarried The Hon Clarissa Catherine de Hochepied-Larpent, daughter of the eighth Baron de Hochepied-Larpent, and thus became brother-in-law of his friends Philip Napier Miles and George Percy Jacomb-Hood.

He is best known for his images' artistic and political critiques in the form of a series of paintings of bananas that have been mutilated by forks and ropes.Lucie-Smith, Edward.Latin American Art of the 20th Century. London: Thames and Hudson, 1993. Background Amaral was born in 1935 in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in Law from the Universidade de S√£o Paulo in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. His interest in art stemmed from a visit to the 1st Biennial in S√£o Paulo in 1951, where he was intrigued by the modern art he saw. In 1952, he took drawing classes from Roberto Sambonet through the S√£o Paulo Museum of Modern Art. Later, in 1957, he entered the School of Engraving and was trained to do woodcuts and linocuts by L√≠vio Abramo. Amaral's first solo exhibition came in 1958 when he showed a group of engravings at the S√£o Paulo Museum of Modern Art.Antonio Henrique Amaral, Edward J Sullivan, Frederico Morais, Maria Alice Milliet. Antonio Henrique Amaral: obra em processo. S√£o Paulo, Brasil: DBA, 1997. In 1959 Amaral enrolled in the Pratt Graphic Institute in New York City where he learned wood engraving from Shiko Munakata and W. Rogalsky. In 1964, there was a coup d‚Äô√©tat in Amaral's native Brazil that replaced the democratic government with a military dictatorship. This new government under the military juntas and the sociopolitical and economic effects it had would become the focus of many of his later paintings. In 1967, Amaral opened an exhibition of woodcuts entitled ‚ÄúO meu e o seu‚Äù (‚ÄúMine and Yours‚Äù), after which he switched to painting as his primary medium. From 1968 to 1975, he painted a series of banana paintings, which he is most famous for. Amaral traveled between Brazil and New York since the early 1970s, until his death. Influences As the banana was Amaral's favorite subject and symbolic representation, it is important to note that he was not the first Brazilian painter to use it. Albert Eckhout (1610‚Äì1665), the Dutch Brazilian painter from the 17th century, also associated the banana with the region that would later become Brazil. Antonio Henrique Amaral's own great-aunt, Tarsila do Amaral (1886‚Äì1973), also used the banana tree and leaf as symbolic of Brazil in the background of many of her paintings. Lasar Segall (1891‚Äì1957) also used banana trees as identification for Brazilian people in his painting, Bananal (1927). These artists all contributed to the emergence of the banana as a symbol of Brazil that Amaral would later adopt. Tropicalismo The Tropicalismo movement that occurred in Brazil was mostly a musical movement, although it also had some aspects of literature, poetry, and visual art. The movement was a ‚Äúcycle of intense creative activity and cultural transformation‚Äù as well as a revival of the Antropofagia movement headed by Tarsila do Amaral in the 1920s and 30s. The movement concerned itself with cultural cannibalism in order to create something that is uniquely Brazilian. The Tropicalismo Movement, as well as Amaral's banana paintings that fell under that category of Tropicalismo, coincided with the political upheaval of the coup d‚Äô√©tat and later repression under the military dictatorship. The Banana Paintings In 1964, General Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco led a coup that replaced the existing government with a military junta. There was a severe recession, which led to popular dissatisfaction with the government. The government responded to peaceful protests with Institutional Act No. 5, which closed Congress, dissolved the veneer of democracy that existed at the time, allowed the regime to arrest, imprison without habeas corpus, and to censor, outlaw criticism, and repress the populace harshly. This is when the dictatorship tortured and often murdered anyone even suspected of opposing it. Without recourse to dialogue or democracy, a small portion of the opposition took to guerilla resistance such as high-profile kidnappings in order to demand their comrades be freed from the dictatorship's torture chambers, and bank robberies. Among other things, Amaral's banana paintings reflected the human rights abuses of the regime and its support by the United States. From 1968 to 1975, Antonio Henrique Amaral painted two series of paintings focused solely on bananas. The first, painted mainly from 1968 to 1972, was titled Brasiliana, while the second, from 1973 to 1974, was titled Campos de batallha, or Battlefields. Brasiliana was more of a banana festival or, as the Brazilians would say, ‚Äúbananas to sell and to give away.‚Äù These bananas were generally less corrupted than Amaral's later bananas but by the end of the series, these too have begun to rot and become entangled in ropes, mimicking the parrot's perch, the most common torture practice by the regime. The Campos de batalha series began around 1973, after Amaral moved back to New York City to avoid the intense censorship and possible retaliation by the Brazilian government. In this series, Amaral introduces sharp, metallic objects like forks and knives that penetrate and cut the bananas. Here he recreates what was happening to the bodies of those who dared resist the totalitarian regime. The symbol of the banana was complex and diverse. In the 1920s, in Tarsila do Amaral‚Äôs day, the banana represented the unique culture and identity of Brazil. By the time Antonio Henrique Amaral began painting bananas, their meaning had been added too. In one regard, the banana symbolized the existence of the ‚Äúbanana republics.‚Äù Brazil was the largest exporter of bananas in the world, making up approximately twenty-three percent of all the world‚Äôs bananas. The economic importance of such a valuable resource was not lost on the Brazilians but they disliked it being the metaphor for behavior because unfortunately for the Brazilian, this export was taken advantage of and exploited by more prosperous countries, particularly the United States of America. Therefore the banana became synonymous with American imperialism and Brazilian dependence on richer countries. The banana mostly represented the people in general and the state of the nation politically, socially, and economically. By the perfectionism in his art, it seemed as though Amaral was attempting to reestablish the importance of the banana as a symbol. The first of the banana series, Boa vizinhanca (The Good Neighbor) in 1968 linked the Brazilian and American flags with a banana, thus pointing out the obvious connection between the two countries. He also changed the Brazilian motto on the flag to highlight the word Esso, which was a large U.S. oil company (now Exxon Mobil) operating in Brazil. After Boa vizinhan√ßa, his paintings became more critical and darker. Amaral began to paint his bananas as rotting, mutilated, turning into ‚Äúmud,‚Äù bound with cord, etc. The banana being synonymous with the human body was ‚Äúbeing victimized by colonialism, repression, and torture.‚Äù The transition from his earlier to his later banana paintings is characterized by the sharp, pointed objects in Battlefields. The objects are gray and black, reminding the viewer of technology and smoke. The forks and knives were metaphors for repression and torture. Battlefields is the confrontation between the inorganic and the organic, the machine and the body. The ropes and sharp objects directly represent the repression occurring under the military dictatorship. The fact that the Battlefield paintings are numbered not named reinforced the anonymity of the victims of the regime. By mutilating his bananas, Amaral reveals the problems wrought by the U.S.-backed regime in Brazil. Style Amaral's style is full of close-ups and strange angles. He paints with photorealism and extreme detail. His use of yellows and greens refer to the Brazilian flag and therefore to Brazilians themselves. He often uses dramatic coloring, dark values, and lots of shadow. The verticals and diagonals he uses, especially in Alone in Green (1973) and Battlefield #31 (1974), bring stress and energy to his paintings, trying to evoke the feeling that what is going on in Brazil is wrong.

The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school, including the graduation ceremony. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offers a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions.

Collins (July 20, 1914 ‚Äì February 14, 2013) was an American producer, director and screenwriter prominent in Hollywood during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. He worked on several notable television programs including Bonanza, General Electric Theater, Matlock and Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre. He was married to actress Dorothy Comingore from 1939 until 1945. One of the characters in the film Guilty by Suspicion was based on his character although he and Dorothy Comingore were long divorced before the HUAC hearings. Early life Richard Collins was born in New York City. He attended various schools in New York, Los Angeles and Paris, including the Browning School, Lycee Janson de Sailly, and Beverly Hills High School. Collins also attended Stanford University for a term and a half before moving back to New York with his family. In 1936, Collins took classes for six months with the New Theatre League, where he joined the Young Communist League, the first of many left- wing associations he made over the years. In 1935, Collins returned to Los Angeles where he took a job at Bloomingdale's while looking for a way into the movie and television industry. Early career Collins' first position was as a script reader at Columbia Pictures, where he stayed for a few months before he was offered a junior writer position at Fox. During the 1930s, Collins would work for some of the biggest studios in Hollywood, including RKO Pictures, Universal Studios, Paramount Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Warner Bros. He wrote or co-wrote many screenplays during this period, including some that would get him in trouble with HUAC in later years, like Song of Russia. He had a successful film career up until the Hollywood 19 were called to testify before HUAC in October, 1947. At that time he agreed with the rest of the so-called unfriendly witnesses to plead the First Amendment Rights of free speech. Only Ten of the nineteen were called and it wasn't until 1951 that Collins was called to testify before HUAC. By this time his politics had changed and he agreed to testify becoming one of the first \\"friendly witnesses.\\" HUAC and the blacklist controversy Collins admitted to formerly being a member of the Communist Party, the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League, Writers' Mobilization, the Joint Anti-Fascist Committee, and the Progressive Citizens of America. Despite his past, Collins claimed that he stopped paying his Communist dues in 1939. Collins became infamous for naming people he knew to be in the Communist Party, even close friends. In all, he ultimately named 26 of his colleagues. Despite being heavily involved in the Communist movement in the 1930s, when he attended four to five meetings a week, he professed that he no longer followed their doctrine and never saw anything he did as an effort to undermine the security of the United States. Later career After clearing his name in front of the HUAC, Collins was hired by Walter Wagner to write Haji Baba and then Riot in Cell Block 11, directed by Don Siegel. He wrote the treatment for the famous cult film Invasion of the Body Snatchers, which he said was based on his experience with the Communist Party and with HUAC. He also wrote screenplays for Pay or Die, Spanish Affair and The Badlanders. Later he wrote for television, including General Electric Theater, 87th Precinct, and Remington Steele. In 1963 he became a television producer for the TV series Breaking Point, followed by Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theater. His big break came when he became producer of the television series Bonanza. In 1976, he was the executive producer of the short-lived western series Sara. The final major production that he worked on was the series Matlock in the 1980s. Death Collins died at the age of 98 on February 14, 2013. He is survived by his son Michael Collins and daughter Judith.

He is a noted specialist in media and information law including defamation, confidence, privacy and data protection. He played a central role in the litigation that sought the full disclosure of UK MP's parliamentary expenses and in the News of the World phone-hacking case. He is known for his privacy work for celebrities who have included Lily Allen, David and Victoria Beckham, Rio Ferdinand, Ashley Cole, Ryan Giggs, as well as others such as retired banker (and ex-knight) Fred Goodwin and Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales. He is a visiting professor at the London School of Economics. Early life Tomlinson was born and grew up in a working-class area of Woodhouse in Leeds, West Yorkshire. After winning a place at Leeds Grammar School he went on to Balliol College, Oxford where he earned the top first in the University in PPE. After Oxford he continued his philosophical studies at the University of Sussex and in 1977 went to the University of Paris VIII, at the time notorious for its radical philosophy department. Tomlinson met the philosopher Gilles Deleuze there and went on to translate eight of his books. Legal career In 1984 he joined New Court Chambers and according to Carman‚Äôs biographer, Dominic Carman, Tomlinson \\"made a deep impression\\" on George Carman who was then head of chambers. Carman regarded him as his star performer, insisting that he become his junior in the two Branson defamation cases \\\\- the British Airways \\"dirty tricks\\" campaign against Virgin Atlantic, and the case involving an alleged attempt to bribe Richard Branson by the head of the lottery company GTECH S.p.A.. In 2000 he became a founder member of Matrix Chambers. Other founding members included Cherie Booth QC, Lord Brennan QC, James Crawford SC, Professor Conor Gearty, Ben Emmerson QC, Lord Ken Macdonald QC, Clare Montgomery QC, Helen Mountfield QC, Tim Owen QC and Philippe Sands QC. Tomlinson has had a very broad practice at the Bar.https://www.matrixlaw.co.uk/member/hugh-tomlinson/ In addition to his work in privacy and media law he been instructed in public law, criminal law and commercial cases. His cases range from substantial Chancery Division cases such as that relating to Marlborough Fine Art and the Francis Bacon Estate to representing the DPP in the Criminal Court of Appeal in the first application on the changed law on double jeopardy. In 2007 Tomlinson successfully represented Lord Baker a former Environment Secretary in a Freedom of Information request against John Prescott, the then Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions. The Information Tribunal ruled that civil servants' advice to ministers on major planning decisions should be disclosed to anyone who asks for it once the decision is taken. He represented Prince Charles in preventing the publication of the Prince‚Äôs Hong Kong travel diaries and claimed that any arguments that the journals should be published in the public interest were \\"far-fetched\\". He was the leading barrister in the campaign to force the public release of information relating to MPs' expenses. Tomlinson is known as a \\"super injunction\\" specialist protecting celebrities from the disclosure of \\"private\\" information but in accordance with the bar‚Äôs taxi rank principle he works on both sides of this legal divide. In the case where England football captain John Terry went to court to protect details of a relationship with Vanessa Perroncel, (the ex-girlfriend of his England team- mate Wayne Bridge) Tomlinson represented Associated Newspapers (not Terry, as is often wrongly reported). He also represented Jeremy Clarkson‚Äôs ex-wife Alex Hall where Clarkson was seeking (but subsequently dropped) efforts to prevent Hall from claiming that they had had an affair during his subsequent marriage. In Ntuli v Donald he again acted for the Defendant, Ntuli, a former partner of \\"Take That‚Äôs\\" Howard Donald, who had obtained a \\"super-injunction\\" to prevent her revealing details of their relationship (and preventing the reporting of the existence of the injunction itself). This was the first appeal against a \\"super-injunction\\". It was removed by the Court of Appeal who allowed the proceedings to be reported and Donald and Ntuli to be named. Tomlinson successfully represented the publisher Harper Collins when the BBC sought to prevent a publication revealing the identity of Top Gear‚Äôs secret racing- driver, The Stig. The new law of privacy has not been popular with newspaper editors. In a 2008 speech to the Society of Editors, the editor of the Daily Mail, Paul Dacre said \\"Britain‚Äôs leading privacy QC, Hugh Tomlinson, declared, in words that should chill all of us, the following..... \\"The law of privacy has come a long way in a short time ... We are gradually moving from a position where anything could be published unless it was forbidden to the opposite ‚Äì nothing can be published unless it can be justified. Under the influence of the Human Rights case law from Strasbourg, we are moving slowly but inescapably towards the stricter privacy protection of French or Italian law.\\" Tomlinson represented Robert Murat in the defamation action against numerous British newspapers. Murat, an Anglo Portuguese local seeking to help was falsely accused by the British press of being involved in the disappearance of the three-year-old Madeleine McCann. Tomlinson also represented Christopher Jefferies, the retired Bristol school teacher and landlord of murder victim Joanna Yeates, over the lurid and malicious press coverage of Jefferies during the case. In both cases substantial damages were received. In the News of the world phone-hacking scandal Tomlinson acted for Sienna Miller whose case led to the final admission by the News of the World that more than one journalist was involved in the hacking. He was the lead counsel for the claimants in the first and second rounds of the Mobile Telephone Voicemail Interception Litigation against the News of the World. His other phone-hacking clients include Jude Law, Ulrika Jonsson, Ashley Cole, Ryan Giggs, Pete Doherty, Leslie Ash, Lee Chapman, Chris Bryant MP, Simon Hughes MP, Brian Paddick, Tessa Jowell MP, John Prescott and Neil and Glenys Kinnock. He also acted in the phone hacking judicial review of the Metropolitan police. In 2014 Tomlinson represented Amnesty International in the Investigatory Powers Tribunal in a case in which the Security Services were forced to concede that their arrangements for dealing with legally privileged material were unlawful and accepted that Amnesty‚Äôs communications had been illegally intercepted. He acted for Amnesty International in its subsequent challenge to the legality of the bulk interception of communications by UK intelligence agencies in the European Court of Human Rights. Tomlinson represented the pianist James Rhodes in his successful 2015 appeal to the Supreme Court which led to the overturning of an injunction to prevent the publication of his autobiography, Instrumental. In 2017, Tomlinson represented the entertainer Michael Barrymore in his successful claim for wrongful arrest against the Essex Police. Blogging Tomlinson is an active blogger. He represented Nightjack the police blogger whom The Times sought (successfully) to name and expose. He is a founding editor of the United Kingdom Supreme Court blog and runs the influential blog Inforrm. This blog is at the centre of the debate on press freedom and regulation and Tomlinson has often blogged his proposals for media and press reform. Media Regulation Tomllnson is a founder member and the Chair of Hacked Off, the campaign for a free and accountable press. This was set up to campaign for a public inquiry into the phone hacking scandal. Shortly afterwards the Leveson Inquiry was set up. Tomlinson gave evidence to the inquiry and a number of his proposals were accepted by the inquiry. Hacked Off supported victims of press abuse who gave evidence and has, since 2011, campaigned for the implementation of Leveson Inquiry recommendations. Tomlinson has written an LSE Media Policy brief on the Leveson recommendations: \\"The New UK Model of Press Regulation\\".http://www.lse.ac.uk/media@lse/documents/MPP/LSE-MPP-Policy- Brief-12-The-New-UK-Model-of-Press-Regulation.pdf Publications *Lender Claims, with T Grant (Sweet & Maxwell, 2010) *The Law of Human Rights, with R Clayton, (Oxford University Press, 2nd Edition, 2009) *‚ÄòImplications for the Private Sector‚Äô in P Carey and M Turle eds, Freedom of Information Handbook (2nd Edn, Law Society, 2008) *Civil Actions Against the Police, with R Clayton (Sweet & Maxwell, 3rd Edition, 2004) *Online Publication Claims: A practical guide, with G Vassall-Adams (Matrix Chambers, 2017).

Before the advent of nautical charts, rutters were the primary store of geographic information for maritime navigation. It was known as a periplus (\\"sailing- around\\" book) in classical antiquity and a portolano (\\"port book\\") to medieval Italian sailors in the Mediterranean Sea. Portuguese navigators of the 16th century called it a roteiro, the French a routier, from which the English word \\"rutter\\" is derived. In Dutch, it was called a leeskarte (\\"reading chart\\"), in German a Seebuch (\\"sea book\\"), and in Spanish a derrotero.  History  Before the advent of nautical charts in the 14th century, navigation at sea relied on the accumulated knowledge of navigators and pilots. Plotting a course at sea required knowing the direction and distance between point A and point B. Knowledge of where places lay relative to each other was acquired by mariners during their long experience at sea. The earliest peripluses of classical antiquity were not necessarily written as practical navigational handbooks. Some were more akin to an adventure travelogue, to celebrate a famous voyage. Others were disguised as such, notably the Periplus of Pseudo- Scylax from the 4th century BCE, which described the harbors and landmarks along the north African coast west of the Nile delta. Still others were designed as commercial guides for merchants, such as the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, written around 100 CE by a Greek merchant in Egypt, as a guide to the market ports of the Red Sea and Indian Ocean. The re-emergence of maritime commerce in the Mediterranean Sea during the Middle Ages (12th‚Äì13th centuries), spearheaded by Italian ports like Amalfi, Pisa, Genoa and Venice, led to the rise of a new set of handbooks, known as portolani (\\"port books\\"), designed for the practical use of mariners. These were likely first compiled by professional mariners and pilots, probably as a mnemonic set of notes for their own personal use.Taylor, (1956: p. 103); Parry (1963: p. 85) These notes were probably passed secretly within their profession ranks, from master to apprentice. Only a few of these Italian handbooks were made public, and even fewer have survived to this day. The most complete surviving portolano is the famous Il compasso da navigare, written c. 1250 and published in Genoa in 1296. In their sailing instructions, Medieval portolan handbooks distinguished between various types of routes, e.g. per starea (coastal cabotage), per peleggio (open-sea sailing between two points). Portolan handbooks expressed their sailing directions in terms compass rose points and distances. The reliance on the magnetic compass (an instrument that only really began being used for navigation in the 13th century.Aczel (2001)) distinguishes the Medieval portolano from the earlier Classical periplus. It is believed that the nautical charts that suddenly emerged in Genoa, Venice, Majorca and other maritime centers after the late 13th century were constructed from the written information contained in contemporary written pilot handbooks, hence the term portolan charts.Brown (1949: p. 103), Taylor (1956: pp. 111‚Äì12). See also Lanman (1987) and Campbell (1987, 2011) The wealth of detail contained in portolano handbooks is reflected in the portolan charts, stunningly accurate even by modern standards. Handbooks often contained a wealth of information beyond sailing directions. For instance, they frequently had detailed physical descriptions of shorelines, harbors, islands, channels, notes about tides, landmarks, reefs, shoals and difficult entries, instructions on how to use navigational instruments to determine position and plot routes, calendars, astronomical tables, mathematical tables and calculation rules (notably the rule of marteloio), lists of customs regulations at different ports, medical recipes, instructions on ship repair, etc.Edson (2007: 51) As a result, the nautical chart never fully replaced the handbook, but remained supplementary to it. Among notable rutters is the Grand Routier, written by the French pilot Pierre Garcie, c. 1483 and published in 1502‚Äì03, which focused on the shores of the Bay of Biscay and the English Channel, and its peculiarities. Translated into English as the Rutter of the Sea in 1528, it was reprinted many times, and remained the pre-eminent rutter used by English sailors for decades.Waters (1985: p. 241); also Markham (1880: p. 355). The first English edition (1528) of Garcie was entitled The Rutter of the Sea, with the laws of the yle of Auleron and translated by Robert Copeland. Copies of the third edition (1541) contained \\"A rutter of the northe, compyled by Rychard Proude\\". Another frequently used rutter was the work Portolano by Pietro Coppo, published in Venice in 1528, which included a collection of sea charts and the description of Christopher Columbus's discovery of America. Coppo was among the last to consider North America an archipelago. Perhaps the most dramatic rutter was the 1595 Reysgheschrift by Dutch sailor Jan Huygen van Linschoten. Having sailed to the Asia aboard Portuguese ships, Linschoten publicized the sailing directions to the East Indies that had been assiduously kept secret by the Portuguese for nearly a century. The publication of Lischoten's rutter was an explosive sensation, and launched the race by a myriad of Dutch and English companies for the East Indies in its aftermath.Koeman (1985), Schmidt (2001: p. 153)  Notable rutters  * Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax (4th century BCE, Greek) * Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (100 CE, Egyptian Greek) * Periplus of the Euxine Sea (160 CE, by Arrian, Greek) * Liber de existencia riveriarum et Forma Maris Nostri Mediterranei (c. 1160‚Äì1200, Pisan) \\"Book of the position of the coasts and the form of our sea, the Mediterranean\\".

Photonic curing is the high-temperature thermal processing of a thin film using pulsed light from a flashlamp.K. A. Schroder, Technical Proceedings of the 2011 NSTI Nanotechnology Conference and Trade Show, 2, 220-223, 2011. When this transient processing is done on a low-temperature substrate such as plastic or paper, it is possible to attain a significantly higher temperature than the substrate can ordinarily withstand under an equilibrium heating source such as an oven. Since the rate of most thermal curing processes (drying, sintering, reacting, annealing, etc.) generally increase exponentially with temperature (i.e. they obey the Arrhenius equation), this process allows materials to be cured much more rapidly than with an oven.K. A. Schroder, S. C. McCool, W. R. Furlan, Technical Proceedings of the 2006 NSTI Nanotechnology Conference and Trade Show, 3, 198-201, 2006. It has become a transformative process used in the manufacture of printed electronics as it allows inexpensive and flexible substrates to be substituted for traditional glass or ceramic substrates. Additionally, the higher temperature processing afforded by photonic curing reduces the processing time exponentially, often from minutes down to milliseconds, which increases throughput all while maintaining a small machine footprint. Uses Photonic curing is used as a thermal processing technique in the manufacturing of printed electronics as it allows the substitution of glass or ceramic substrate materials with inexpensive and flexible substrate materials such as polymers or paper. The effect can be demonstrated with an ordinary camera flash.US Pat. #7,820,097. Industrial photonic curing systems are typically water cooled and have controls and features similar to industrial lasers. The pulse rate can be fast enough to allow curing on the fly at speeds beyond 100 m/min making it suitable as a curing process for roll-to-roll processing. Material processing rates can exceed 1 m2/s. The maturing complexity of modern printed electronics for customer applications demands high throughput manufacturing and improved device function. The functionality of the printed electronics is critically important as customers demand more out of each device. Multiple layers are designed into each device, requiring ever more versatile processing techniques. Photonic curing is uniquely suited to complement the processing needs in the manufacture of modern printed electronics by providing a fast, reliable and transformative processing step. Photonic curing enables a lower thermal processing budget with current materials, and it can provide a path to incorporate more advanced materials and functionality into future printed electronics. Development Photonic curing is similar to Pulse Thermal Processing, developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, in which a plasma arc lamp is used. In the case of photonic curing, the radiant power is higher and the pulse length is shorter. The total radiant exposure per pulse is less with photonic curing, but the pulse rate is much faster.

F. Drake State Community and Technical College is a combination community college and technical trade college in Huntsville, Alabama. As of the Fall 2013 semester, Drake State has an enrollment of 1,384 students. History The college was founded in 1961 as the Huntsville State Vocational Technical College. The campus opened September 1962 with one building built on 32 acres deeded by Alabama A&M; University. Enrollment at opening consisted of 27 students in three programs: brick masonry, cosmetology, and auto mechanics. In 1966, the school was renamed J. F. Drake State Technical Trade School in honor of Joseph Fanning Drake, a long-serving president of Alabama A&M; University. The school desegregated in 1967, becoming the first desegregated postsecondary technical school in the country. The school was awarded technical college status in 1973 and took the name J.F. Drake State Technical College. In 2013, the college was again renamed after long-awaited state approval. The college is now officially known as J.F. Drake State Community and Technical College. This change was petitioned for when the institution attained community college status after earning membership in the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in July 2012. J.F. Drake State is currently the only higher education institution in the state of Alabama to receive this naming convention. This allows the college to operate as both a traditional two-year community college, while retaining its renowned technical trade programs. The school colors are royal blue and white and the mascot is the Blue Eagle. Dr. Patricia Sims is the college president, being only the fourth permanent president to serve the college.http://whnt.com/2017/05/16/the-alabama-community-college- system-announces-a-new-interim-president-for-huntsville-schools/ Academics Drake currently offers programs of study in four divisions: * Business and Engineering Technologies * General and Developmental Education * Health Sciences Technology * Applied Services Technology Campus The main campus of J.F.

The plot focuses on two documentary filmmakers who attempt to expose a cult led by a charismatic leader (Marling) who claims to be from the future. The film was written by Batmanglij and Marling. It premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. It was also selected to close the 2011 SXSW Film Festival. The film was released by Fox Searchlight Pictures on April 27, 2012. Plot In Los Angeles, substitute schoolteacher Peter and aspiring writer Lorna are a couple in their twenties making a film documentary. Their subject is a secretive cult led by the mysterious Maggie, whom they plan to expose as a fraud. When the cult considers Peter and Lorna ready to meet Maggie, they are made to shower thoroughly and dress in white surgical gowns. Then they are driven blindfolded to a secret basement location and received by Klaus, with whom they exchange a distinctive, intricate handshake, which they have been practicing. Peter and Lorna then join eight other members and meet Maggie, who uses an oxygen tank and implies that the showering and clothing requirements are to avoid aggravating her illness. Maggie claims to be a time-traveler from the year 2054. She describes the future as riddled with war, famine and struggle, and has come back to select a special band of chosen people to prepare for what lies ahead. She leads the group in a series of intense psychological exercises and tells them about herself and the future, never proving nor disproving her extraordinary claim. Maggie's charismatic manner is powerful, and both Lorna and Peter have moments in which they waver between skepticism and belief. Lorna is especially concerned when she notices that Peter, who was initially adamant that Maggie was a charlatan, seems to now be intrigued by and even attracted to Maggie. After several group meetings, Maggie instructs Peter to bring her the eccentric eight-year-old Abigail Pritchett, one of his students. Maggie insists Abigail is her mother, and that Peter and Lorna will be banned from the group if he fails to comply. When Peter admits that he is considering following Maggie's orders, Lorna is outraged and accuses him of falling for Maggie's deception. After they argue, Lorna is privately approached by Carol, a woman who identifies herself as a Justice Department agent. Carol tells Lorna that Maggie is wanted for a variety of felonies. Lorna agrees to set Maggie up to be captured and to hide this plan from Peter. With Lorna's help Peter arranges for Maggie to meet the student in public, at the LaBrea Tar Pits, during a class field trip. When Maggie meets the little girl, Peter is amazed to see them wordlessly perform the cult's intricate handshake. Abigail asks Maggie how she knew her secret handshake, and Maggie reverently responds: \\"You taught it to me.\\" Men in police uniforms burst into the room and seize Maggie. As cult members angrily accuse Peter of betraying Maggie, he exchanges a glance with Lorna who smiles slightly, affirming her role in Maggie's capture. Abigail then asks Peter who Maggie was, and he responds, stricken, that he does not know.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film has a 75% approval rating from critics based on 104 reviews. Manohla Dargis wrote in her review in The New York Times: \\"Nobody is gutted in Sound of My Voice, a smart, effectively unsettling movie about the need to believe and the hard, cruel arts of persuasion. But over time the men and women who meet in a mysterious house in an anonymous Los Angeles neighborhood ‚Äì where they shed their clothes and cleanse their bodies in a ritual ‚Äì are opened up bit by bit, wound by wound, until they‚Äôre sobbing and laughing, their insides smeared across the carpet.\\" Brent Simon, a film critic, summed up Sound of My Voice as, \\"a delicate, mesmeric thing that dances darkly along the edges of psychology, religion and science-fiction, raising questions about faith, identity, self-betterment and romantic connection.\\" In September 2012, the film won the Octopus d‚ÄôOr for the best international feature film at the Strasbourg European Fantastic Film Festival. In his round-up of 2012's cinematic standouts, Variety film critic Peter Debruge admitted to having watched Sound of My Voice four times and called it an \\"ingenious low-budget puzzler.\\" Planned follow-ups The film was originally intended to be the first installment of a trilogy.

Since 1975, Brennan has worked for myriad government agencies, including the Department of Health, the Department of Social Security, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Ministry of Defence, and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. During her career, she has been an outspoken proponent of the need for gender equality. For her public service, Brennan was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the Bath in 2013.  Early life and education  Brennan was born in Sevenoaks, Kent, and was educated at Putney High School in London. She attended the University of Kent in Canterbury, where she earned a degree in English and American Literature. Following university, Brennan worked at the Inner London Education Authority from 1973 to 1975.  Civil service   Department of Health  In 1975, Brennan began work with the Department of Health and Social Security (which became the Department of Health in 1988). She worked several positions in the health division before joining the social security division, where she worked on disability benefits policy from 1990 to 1993. Brennan moved into operations, becoming director of the department's IT Services Agency from 1993 to 1995. From 1995 to 1997, she was disability policy director at the Department of Social Security. After that she became director of Change Management at the department's Benefits Agency, where she oversaw a staff of more than 1,000 employees. She was appointed director-general of the Department for Work and Pensions in 1999.  Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  From 2004 to 2006, Brennan served as the director-general of the Living Land and Seas division at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). Her responsibilities included leadership of the protection of wildlife and the countryside, and leadership of the division's strategy for rural disadvantage. She led the merging and creation of two new non-departmental public bodies, the restructuring delivery of grants and advice to rural business, and the implementation of a review of rural delivery.  Ministry of Justice  In 2006 and 2007, Brennan was chief executive of the Office for Criminal Justice Reform, a now defunct office that supported joint cooperation among the three criminal justice departments and criminal justice agencies. Brennan led the review to create a new structure for the Ministry of Justice, where she worked from April to September 2008 as director-general of Corporate Performance. Her area of responsibility encompassed leadership of the corporate functions in the Ministry, including finance, IT, human resources, strategy and planning, communications, and research and analysis.  Ministry of Defence  In October 2008, Brennan joined the Ministry of Defence as Second Permanent Under-Secretary. She was appointed Permanent Secretary in October 2010, replacing Sir William Jeffrey. As Permanent Secretary, Brennan's responsibilities included acting as joint chief operating officer of the department, responsible for organisation and management, along with Chief of the Defence. She was also principal accounting officer for the Department of Defence, and as such was accountable to Parliament for the efficient and effective use of department resources. During her time at the Ministry of Defence, Brennan made headlines when she stated in 2011 that the British military needed to do more to integrate women into the higher ranks, saying, \\"They need to get on with it, and promote some women... (Women) are not going to hit the nuclear trigger button by mistake.\\" She also oversaw the 2011 investigation into the conduct of then Minister of Defence Liam Fox, who had allowed his friend Adam Werritty to join him on foreign missions, attend official diplomatic meetings and, despite having no security clearance, visit him repeatedly at the Ministry office.  Return to Ministry of Justice  On 12 June 2012, it was announced by Sir Bob Kerslake, Head of Her Majesty's Civil Service, that Brennan would return to the Ministry of Justice as Permanent Secretary and Clerk of the Crown in Chancery. She replaced Sir Suma Chakrabarti, who left to become president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In an interview in July 2012, Brennan spoke again about the need for gender equity in the workplace, saying, \\"The representation of women at the top levels of the civil service has really changed, but I've worked in departments where even when we got to several women on the board, it just takes a couple of departures and it's gone. You really need a relentless focus as you can think you have won the battle and then you find it's too easy to slip back.\\" Brennan retired from the civil service at the end of July 2015. She was succeeded as Permanent Secretary by Richard Heaton.  Other positions  She also served on the Honours Committee, a Cabinet Office committee that nominates citizens for the monarch's Birthday and New Year's Honours.  Honours  In 2011, Brennan earned an honorary Doctorate of Civil Law from her alma mater. In 2013, she was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the Bath, for public service, in Queen Elizabeth's New Year Honours.

The line was built for the Midland Railway and the station opened on 2 October 1848. Originally sited to the west of the road bridge, the station was resited to the east of the bridge . Gresley station was closed on 7 September 1964 but the line remains open for freight traffic. From 1906 to 1927, a branch of the Burton and Ashby Light Railway terminated at the station. In the 1990s BR planned to restore passenger services between Leicester and Burton as the second phase of its Ivanhoe Line project. However, after the privatisation of British Rail in 1995 this phase of the project was discontinued. In 2009 the Association of Train Operating Companies published a ¬£49 million proposal to restore passenger services to the line that would include reopening a station at Gresley to serve the town of Swadlincote.

The dates of his reign are disputed by scholars in a range from 1462 to 1464. Life Almost nothing is known about the life and the patriarchate of Sophronius. It is known an act with his name dated August 1464 which certified a cross belonged to Emperor David of Trebizond: the document is probably a forgery, but it confirms us that Sophronius was actually the patriarch. According to Blanchet, who places the reign of Sophronius after Joasaph's, he was Metropolitan of Heraclea before being elected patriarch. One primary source designates Sophronius with the name Syropoulos. Thus it was conjectured, but not proven, that Sophronius was indeed Sylvester Syropoulos, the Orthodox cleric who participated at the Council of Florence and who wrote a chronicle of it. Sylvester Syropoulos belonged to the faction which was in favor of the East-West Union of Churches, and he signed the documents of the council. This fact works against the possible identification of Sophronius with Sylvester Syropoulos; if however he is indeed the same person, it could justify the virtual damnatio memoriae displayed in the primary sources against him. Disputed chronology The chronology of the reign of Sophronius I is disputed among scholars. Recent scholarship, such as Kiminas (2009), Podskalsky (1988), Laurent (1968) and Runciman (1985), places the reign of Sophronius I after Joasaph I, dating it between June 1463 and August 1464. Other scholars, following Bishop Gemanos of Sardeis (1933‚Äì8) and Grumel (1958), as well as the official website of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, propose that Sophronius I reigned before Joasaph I, however the dates they provide differ only by a few months from the ones mentioned above due to a different suggested length of the second term of Gennadius Scholarius. Blanchet (2001) places Sophronius' reign from 1 April 1462 to summer 1464, directly after Isidore II and immediately before Joasaph. Furthermore, there is no consensus among scholars on the length and chronology of the second and third terms of Gennadius Scholarius, which supposedly alternated the patriarchates of Joasaph and Sophronius. For a comparison of the main scholar suggestions, see the List of Patriarchs of Constantinople.

Baynton was son and heir of Sir Edward Baynton, of Bromham-Baynton, Wiltshire, a favourite courtier of Henry VIII, vice-chamberlain to three of his queens, and a friend and patron of Hugh Latimer, some of the correspondence between them (ca. 1530) being printed in Foxe's Book of Martyrs. Baynton, born in 1515‚Äì6, was placed by his father to study French under John Palsgrave, the court tutor, and wrote a prefatory letter to his master's book, L'esclaircissement de la langue francaise (1530). About the same time he attended Knyvett on his embassy from Henry to the emperor. Succeeding his father (ca. 1544), he was returned to Parliament for Marlborough in 1545, Horsham in 1547, Westbury in Oct 1553, Marlborough again in 1555, and Calne in 1558‚Äì9. Bayton married, first, Phillipa Brulet; after annulment in 1562, he married Frances Lee and they had one daughter, Anne. She did not inherit because Andrew had entailed the Baynton estates to his brother Edward (1517‚Äì1593).

It began delivery to users in 2012. Development in flight before painting In 2005, Gulfstream and IAI began designing a follow-on aircraft to the Gulfstream G200. The new model, named G250, was launched in 2008. Planned improvements included new glass cockpit and engines, larger wing, and heated leading edges.; The G250 took its maiden flight on December 11, 2009 in Tel Aviv, Israel. In July 2011, the G250 was renamed G280, as the company had \\"determined that G280 is a more amenable number sequence [than G250] in certain cultures.\\" In Mandarin, the number 250 can be translated as \\"stupid\\" or \\"idiotic\\". After the flight test program, the G280 demonstrated a range of 3,600 nmi (6,667 km) at Mach 0.80 with four passengers and NBAA IFR reserves in 2011. It can fly from London to New York or Singapore to Dubai. Its balanced field length has been reduced to 4,750 feet (1,448 m) from the G200's 4,960 feet (1,512 m). The G280 was provisionally certified in December 2011 by Israel. In July 2012, the US FAA released a report with conditions to ensure no security gaps in the G280's electronic systems. It received full certification from Israel and the US on September 4, 2012. Design The aerodynamic design of its wing and empennage, and design of the interior were performed by Gulfstream; detailed design was performed by IAI to Gulfstream's requirements. It is a Gulfstream designed aircraft under a new type certificate.\\"Gulfstream Scores Double Win with G280, G650 Certification\\". AIN Online, October 2012. G280 cabin The aircraft has several improvements, among them increased cabin length (external fuselage dimensions remain unchanged; the rear fuselage fuel tank was eliminated to add 17 inches (43 cm) of usable interior area). It has a new HTF7250G engine, new T-tail (with larger horizontal and vertical stabilizers), wing anti-ice provided by engine bleed air, cabin with four more windows and access from the cabin to the baggage compartment. It competes against the Bombardier Challenger 300 and the Cessna Citation X+. The fuselage, empennage and landing gear are manufactured by IAI, the wing by Spirit AeroSystems (now by Triumph Group), and the aircraft is assembled in Israel. It is then ferried to Dallas, Texas, for interior finishing and painting. Its wing is a new design, using the Gulfstream G550 airfoil, and has a larger area of 495 ft¬≤ vs. 369 ft¬≤ of the G200. This allows the business jet to climb directly to . Design cruise for the new airfoil is Mach 0.80, vs. Mach 0.75 for the G200 wing.

He was the son of Charles Le Moyne and Catherine Thierry. He died in Quebec City in 1690. History In 1686, Jacques Le Moyne, with his brothers, Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville and Paul Le Moyne de Maricourt, and the Chevalier de Troyes set out for the Hudson Bay to drive out the English, reclaiming it for France. The trip took 85 days up the Ottawa River, Lake Timiskaming, and Abitibi River. They and fourteen other men were successful in attacking a series of forts in the area, in effect, winning back the territory. In 1687, he headed 300 Indians against the Senecas. The Governor of New France, the Marquis de Denonville made him lieutenant. In 1689 the Compagnie du Nord asked Jacques Le Moyne to try out a new route to Hudson Bay. He left with 38 men and British ships seized in Hudson Bay and made the trip in 28 days. In 1690, Governor Louis de Buade de Frontenac counterattacked the English colonies with the raids made by the Iroquois incited by the English. Of the three expeditionary corps he raised, the Montreal detachment was led by Jacques Le Moyne and Nicolas d‚ÄôAilleboust de Manthet. The detachment was composed of 96 Canadians and 114 Frenchmen. In October of that same year, Le Moyne was posted as for the attack by William Phips. With accurate firing, two of Phips's ship retreated and tried to take refuge. The flagship was struck and leaking with many of its crew dead or wounded. Major Jown Walley was prevented from taking Qu√©bec City by gunners and by a detachment of men led by Jacques Le Moyne. However, Le Moyne was wounded in the leg, and the wound became worst after a few days. Sainte-H√©l√®ne was taken to the H√¥tel-Dieu de Qu√©bec hospital where he died at the beginning of December 1690. Jacques Le Moyne de Sainte-H√©l√®ne married Jeanne Dufresnoy Carion in Montreal.

Sometime after his birth, the family moved from the Lower East Side to the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. Berger dropped out of school for financial reasons and became a messenger for a newspaper, The New York World. During World War I, Berger fought with the 106th Infantry, 26th Division and was awarded a Purple Heart and the Silver Star. In 1928, Berger joined the staff of The Times, where, except for a short stint at The New Yorker, he worked until his death in 1959. At The Times Berger soon became the top color writer at The TimesGreatreporters.co.uk (whose 1959 obituary labeled him \\"master of human-interest story\\") writing mostly on local matters including murders, the mob, and the 1939 New York World's Fair. Known for his use of detail and color, Berger's pieces were often used in other media. His report on the first wounded soldiers returning from Europe during World War II became a radio script while another became a documentary. In 1939, he began the column \\"About New York\\". His book about New York, The Eight Million: a journal of a New York correspondent, was published by Simon & Schuster in 1942, as was The Story of the New York Times 1851‚Äì1951 in 1951.

A 28-year-old World War II veteran, Unruh killed 13 people, wounded several others and was arrested after a police standoff at his apartment in Camden. For the report, Berger retraced Unruh's steps and interviewed 50 witnesses. He prepared and typed the 4,000-word article in two- and-a-half hours and it was published unedited in the newspaper the next morning.

British Masters is a three-part BBC television series on 20th century British art, presented by Dr James Fox and first broadcast in July 2011 on BBC Four.British Masters, BBC4 Press Office The series covers the period from 1910 to 1975. The first programme explored the lives and works of Mark Gertler, Lawrence Alma-Tadema, Walter Sickert, Wyndham Lewis, Lawrence Atkinson, David Bomberg, Richard Nevinson, Paul Nash and Stanley Spencer. The second programme explored the works of John Nash, Stanley Spencer, Alfred Munnings, William Coldstream, Paul Nash and John Piper. In the third programme, subtitled 'A New Jerusalem,' Fox explored British art in the aftermath of the 2nd World War, and examined the works of Lucian Freud, Graham Sutherland, Francis Bacon, Richard Hamilton, David Hockney and Keith Vaughan. In this final programme of the series Fox explored how the themes of evil, brutality, dehumanisation, consumerism and optimism can be seen in the works of these postwar artists. Fox contends in this programme that the death of Lucian Freud and the emergence of conceptual art have marginalised, eclipsed and brought to an end the tradition of British figurative painting. In each case, the backgrounds, techniques, subjects and interests of each artist are analysed against a backdrop of the social and political events of their day, especially the two world wars, the decline of Edwardian values and traditions, the poverty and economic turmoil of the 1920s and 1930s and the relative sense of optimism following both wars. The programmes also reflect a personal and national search for security in enduring but elusive British values, beliefs and identity in what Fox depicts as a century of crisis and upheaval, in which much more had perhaps been lost than gained. Fox's provocative approach seems to have divided the critics: The Times called the series \\"superb television;\\"David Chater, \\"Monday's TV: British Masters,\\" The Times 16 July 2011 and The Observer called it \\"absurdly lucid,\\"Euan Ferguson, Rewind TV, The Observer, 17 July 2011 but one critic criticised the series for its \\"grandiose, inflammatory statements,\\"John Preston, British Masters, BBC Four, The Night Watch, BBC Two, review, The Telegraph, 15 July 2011 while Fisun G√ºner described Fox's revisionist case as \\"ludicrous.\\"G√ºner, Fisun, British Masters, BBC Four/ The World's Most Expensive Paintings, BBC One, 12 July 2011  References  External links British Masters: My one big chance to get even, BBC blog Category:British documentary television series Category:BBC television documentaries Category:2010s British documentary television series Category:2011 British television series debuts Category:Documentary television series about art Category:British art ","title":"British Masters (TV series)"},{"id":"32457644","text":"Normal as the Next Guy is the 6th and final album by The Knack, released in 2001.

Its remains lie 5 miles east of Dally Castle. There is no evidence to suggest that any fortification existed on the site before 1157, when the lands were granted as liberty to the King of Scotland. According to sources, a castle and manor house was erected on a mound now known as Hallsfield during the reign of Richard II by a certain Richard De Bellingham of the De Bellingham Family, who were given the estate as well as the title of Baron by the monarch. The estate was then passed on to the Derwentwater's. However due to his joining the rebel cause during the Jacobite Rebellion in 1715 the Earl of Derwentwater was stripped of his title and his estate and after his attainder, the manor was awarded to the Governors of the Greenwich Hospital. By the 13th century all traces of the castle proper and its fortifications had been lost and at present even the exact location of the castle is in doubt, as the raised mound attributed as being the earthworks of the castle has been speculated to be natural, as the round truncated second mound on top of the first cannot be the mound of a defensive tower as it is too small.

It lies west of Bellingham Castle, and west of Bellingham on the Chirdon Burn, a tributary of the North Tyne. Dally Castle House was built in the 18th century next to the castle. Across the road lies a small flour mill used to grind wheat during the Napoleonic War. History Dally Castle was probably built in 1237. On Speed's map of 1611 it is called Dala, and earlier in his Britannia, Camden called it Delaley. Its history is obscure: originally it was an oblong building of two storeys, with two turrets later added to the north corners and a south wing constructed. The stones were used to build Dally Mill and only the foundations can be traced. DaIly Castle also has its tragic legend: the owner's sister fell in love with her brother's enemy, Gilbert of Tarset. During one of their meetings, the couple were surprised by her brother, who pursued Gilbert to the summit of Hareshaw Common. A fight took place and Gilbert was slain. The spot where he felI is known today as Gib's Cross.Pele Towers of the Scottish Borders, p 127 The castle has been identified with the 'house in the form of a tower' that either David de Lindsay, justiciar of Lothian, or his young namesake, the ward of Alexander of Scotland, was building in Tynedale in 1237, to the alarm of the sheriff Hugh of Bolbec; however, for this there is no positive evidence, and as David had been granted Chirdon (commanding a more important crossing of the Chirdon burn than Dally does) and one would have expected him to build there. The castle was at first a simple oblong building, defended at ground floor level by loopholes for bowmen, and having an upper floor, presumably entered by an outside wooden stair. Its date might have been either in the reign of John or in that of his successor, Henry III. Later in the thirteenth century, the building (which may have been left unfinished) was completed with the addition of a north-west corner turret and south wing, and its defence was moved from the ground floor to crenellated parapets at roof level; at that point the loopholes no longer needed to be carefully built up, except one which was enlarged to light a chamber with a fireplace. Later a north-east turret was added, the south-west corner was strengthened, and an enclosure made on the south scarp of the castle hill. The building continued in habitation till the sixteenth century or later, as is proved by the helmet, sword point, and 'fairy' tobacco pipes found under the debris of the north- west turret in 1888; however, it had become a ruin before Camden visited it in the reign of James I. The Armstrongs' map shows it as a ruin, and apparently during the eighteenth century the roofless walls collapsed and all visible and easily accessible stones were removed to help build Dally Mill. At any rate, when John Hodgson visited Dally he could see no masonry above the turf. In 1888, Mr. W. L. Charleton removed enough of the debris to reveal the remains hereafter described, but most unfortunately no proper record was kept of his funds and the owner allowed a set of 'fine columns', probably the supports of the hall roof, to be taken away to build a piggery. Even the plan published seventeen years later in Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne was neither complete nor accurate. An interesting Early English pierced chimney head, one of the very few of that period in existence, was found and removed by Mr. Charleton. Description The upper and lower halves of the valley watered by the Chirdon are separated by a natural barrier in the shape of a high steep-sided ridge or \\"kaim\\" pierced at east end by the stream. The eastern part this ridge has been isolated by cutting a gap through it, as in the similar case of Wark on Tweed. A smaller notch cuts off the extreme eastern point of the ridge, and Dally castle stands along the narrow top of the ridge with its west end overlooking the larger ditch. There are also traces of masonry on the low mound east of the eastern ditch. Floor plan. The castle proper was in two portions, the first a building about east of the main building and not on the same orientation. It is not now possible to state its period or use: it may have been a barn, or even a chapel. The second was an oblong block 56' 6\\" by 26' 8\\" (17.2 by 8.1 m) internally, with attached turrets at the two northern corners and a larger turret or wing on the south. The south wing has entirely disappeared except for short lengths of its walls, and these are certainly additions to the main south wall, to which they have been bonded. The walls of the main block are from thick and contain fish- tailed loopholes as shown on the plan and detail drawings. The loopholes have been very neatly built up with masonry, faced with the same kind of ashlar as that in the rest of the interior; the courses are carefully lined through, though not bonded, and triangular stones are neatly cut out to fit the narrow part of the embrasure and even to fit into the fish-tailed sill. The embrasure of the loophole in the east gable was not entirely blocked; the upper part of it became a cupboard with a giblet check cut in each jamb for its door, and a heavily barred window took the place of a loophole on the westmost bay of the south front. This window was surrounded by quarter-round moulding of radius and the edges of the loopholes are neatly rounded. The west end of the building has marked resemblance in plan to the east end of Haughton Castle. At its north corner there is a turret 9' 7\\" by I3' 10\\" (2.92 by 4.22 m) internally with walls thick, having an external base course which butts irregularly against the double chamfered base of the main building. At the south corner, a narrow door with chamfered jambs and sill gives entrance to what must have been either a mural stair or a small turret; this formed a weak point both structurally and strategically and was twice strengthened and reconstructed. Beside the door is a fireplace resembling (even in its dimensions) that at Haughton, and obviously an insertion as it blocks one of the earlier archery embrasures. Its projecting hood was supported on a pair of plain splayed corbels. Both in the turret and the fireplace there is much thin flat-bedded rubble, a feature also found at Haughton. The north front has two broad buttresses, both of which are additions to the work; one of them has still two weathered courses on its face, and the other is incomplete. From their setting out (see plan) these buttresses were built with the north-west turret but earlier than the north-east one. This north turret seems to have replaced a mural stair or small chamber like that at the south-west corner, and the lower part of the earlier corner can be seen inside it, for it has no door. Its walls are both thinner and rougher than those elsewhere, and internally are of a deep red colour. They have never been plastered, but the whole of the rest of the interior, whether rubble in the turret or ashlar in the central space, has been skimmed with a thin coat of plaster. neatly finished to a straight edge. The north and south sides of the building have double base courses externally, but these are not returned across the gables. From the south-east corner, a wall thick ran down the south scarp of the hill all the way to a ditch which runs in a curve all round castle and hill, passing through the two already mentioned gaps in the kaim. From the existing remains we know that the ground floor of the castle had central pillars caming a longitudinal beam on which the first floor joists rested, their ends being notched to runners supported on corbels (see details). On the upper floor there was a central colonnade, with responds at the ends, supporting either arches or more probably a timber framework to carry the roof. At the west end of the first floor was a fireplace flanked by detached columns with attached moulded caps and bases. Somewhere also at the west end was a neat chimney head with four small outlets for smoke, and if this was really David de Lindsay's stronghold we know from Hugh of Bolbec's description that it had parapet walks round its roof. The existence of parapets is not necessarily confirmed by the presence of several lengths of stone channels, but with the blocking up of the loopholes it became almost essential to provide parapets, if only on the turrets. There is a ford at Dally, but the right bank of the Chirdon is steep and craggy and a narrow pack-horse or foot bridge of timber on stone abutments was thrown across the water, probably at some period when either Dally Castle or Dally Mill was in occupation. The stone abutments are well built of rubble in mortar and have the unusual feature of terminating in semicircular ends facing across the stream.History of Northumberland, Volume 14, Published 1940 Dally Castle was purchased from the Earl of Suffolk in 1664 by William Charlton of the Bower, and in 1841 when the rest of the estate passed to Sir Edward Haggerston.N.C.H. vol. iv.

(1 May 1862 ‚Äì 16 February 1928), was a British Indian attorney, politician, and mayor of Karachi in modern-day Pakistan. He is considered a great Sindhi and ‚Äúthe father of modern Karachi.‚Äù His social, educational, and political services rendered to the people of Sindh are so great that he is now recognised as one of the makers of modern Karachi. He was one of the first six young Sindhi men who graduated from Elphinstone College in Bombay prior to 1887. After completing law in 1885, Harchandrai accepted a junior position in the Shikarpur court, but soon resigned to begin a law practice in Karachi. He was the elected Honorary Secretary of Karachi Bar Association just after its establishment in 1890, and served for a full 38 years. Harchandrai was the elected as a member of Karachi Municipality in 1888, and then served a term of ten years as its president between 1911‚Äì1921. As mayor of Karachi, he oversaw a major beautification project, which involved development of new roads, parks, residential and recreational areas.He was subsequently appointed to the Viceroy's Executive Council and was an Ex officio member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom until his death in 1928.  Early life  Seth Harchandrai Vishandas was born in 1862 in the village of Manjhand in tehsil Kotri, Sindh. He was born into a Bharvani familyknown for its public-spirited members. His received his primary education at a school in Manjhand founded by his father, Seth Vishandas Nihalchand. After completing his primary, Harchandrai was sent to Kotri for middle education at a missionary school, and boarded there in a spacious bungalow. He was subsequently admitted to NJV High School in Karachi. He matriculated in 1878 and went to live with his maternal grandfather. Thereafter, Harchandrai went to Bombay for higher education and read law at Elphinstone College, which he later patronised as his Alma mater. He received his law degree in 1882.  Professional background   Legal field  Harchandrai was a lawyer and a Queen's Counsel under Queen Victoria, and later King‚Äôs Counsel under King Edward VII and King George V. Harchandrai initially took on a subordinate role in Shikarpur court. Persuaded by his father, he soon resigned and began his own law practice in Karachi in 1886. He was elected honorary secretary of the Karachi Bar Association. Mayorship of Karachi Harchandrai was elected mayor of the Karachi Municipal Committee in 1911 until 1921. Under his mayorship, civic improvements led to the installation of gas lamps along the city's streets and the introduction of footpaths. Electricity was introduced in Karachi in 1913 by Mayor Harichand Rai. That‚Äôs why Karachi was called (and still is) ‚Äòcity of lights.‚Äô Interestingly, it didn‚Äôt become common in US till 1920, even though the electric bulb was invented there. He was also responsible for development works which led to shifting the course of the Lyari River, which opened up land for development.  Social services and politics  Seth Harchandrai played a role as a freedom fighter of India. Seth Harchandrai in left with Mahatma Gandhi Harchandrai was the first Sindhi to join the Indian National Congress and served the cause of national independence with dedication. He was influential in Congress; the 28th session of Congress in 1913 was held in Karachi largely due to the efforts of Harchandrai, his father Seth Vishandas and Ghulam Mohamed Bhurgari. He and his father served as chairman and Secretary of reception committee for that session. and he later presided over many Congress conferences in Sindh. Harchandrai was a believer of Hindu-Muslim unity and was a Sufistic. The Theosophical Society made him a member.  Death  Harchandrai Vishandas died on 16 February 1928 in Delhi. When the British Simon Commission was sent to India to dispute and review the working of 1919 reforms, the Congress party pressed for its boycott. Harchandrai's vote was required for that purpose. Thus, he chose to leave Karachi against the advice of his doctor and friends, so determined he was to record his vote against the Simon Commission. However, on his way from the railway station to the Assembly Hall, Harchandrai suddenly died. On 16 February 1934, on his sixth death anniversary, a statue of Harchandrai was unveiled in front of Karachi Municipal Corporation Building. It was removed shortly after the partition of India in 1947.

John M. \\"Confederate Military History, a library of Confederate States\\", Military History: Volume 10.2, Arkansas Clement Anselm Evans, Ed., Page 306, Accessed 21 July 2011, http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2001.05.0254%3Achapter%3D11%3Apage%3D306, They remained at Bowling Green, Kentucky, until the evacuation of that place when they were placed to guard the rear on the retreat. After the losses of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in February 1862, Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston withdrew his forces into western Tennessee, northern Mississippi, and Alabama to reorganize. and then retreated through western Tennessee to Corinth, Mississippi. On March 29, 1862, the Army of Central Kentucky was merged into the Army of Mississippi in preparation for the Battle of Shiloh. Bowen's Brigade, including the 9th and 10th Arkansas Infantry Regiments, was then placed in General Brigadier General John C. Breckinridge's Reserve Corps as part of the Army of Mississippi. It fought gallantly at Shiloh, charging repeatedly upon the \\"Hornet's Nest\\" where it lost Lieutenant Colonel Dunlop. It was through this regiment that General Albert Sidney Johnston rode from the rear to the front, with a tin cup he had appropriated earlier that morning, saying \\"Men of Arkansas, the enemy is stubborn. I want you to show General Beauregard and General Bragg what you can do with your bayonets and toothpicks!\\" The regiment went forward with a cheer and passed him at a run; in five minutes 130 men of their ranks were killed or wounded, but they did not falter. Lieutenant Duckworth was killed at the head of his company, and Captain Wallace was wounded. It closed up and disappeared into the thicket in front, followed by the whole Confederate line, and the enemy was silenced in twenty minutes. General Johnston, however, received a mortal wound while leading this charge, and shortly thereafter bled to death. The unit reported 17 killed and 115 wounded at Shiloh.United States.

After the retreat from Shiloh, the 9th Arkansas returned to Corinth, Mississippi and participated in the Iuka-Corinth Campaign, in the battles of Corinth, and Iuka, Mississippi. They served at the Battle of Coffeeville, where the unit reported 16 casualties. The unit was assigned under Generals Rust, Buford, and Beall in the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana and in the Vicksburg Campaign in the spring and summer of 1863, where they served briefly in the garrisons of Port Hudson, Louisiana, and Jackson, Mississippi, then fought in the Battle of Champion Hill on May 15, 1863. The 9th served in Brigadier General Abraham Buford's brigade of Major General William W. Loring's division of Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton's Confederate Army at Champion Hill, and following that battle, Loring retreated north to join General Joseph E. Johnston's army near Jackson rather than being trapped with the rest of Pemberton's army in the Vicksburg defenses. Johnston had been gathering troops at Jackson, intending to relieve pressure on Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton's beleaguered garrison. Johnston cautiously advanced his 30,000 soldiers toward the rear of Grant's army surrounding Vicksburg.Korn, Jerry, and the Editors of Time-Life Books. War on the Mississippi: Grant's Vicksburg Campaign. Alexandria, VA: Time-Life Books, 1985. , Page 156. In response, Grant ordered Sherman to deal with Johnston's threat. By July 1, 1863, Johnston's force was in position along the Big Black River. Sherman used the newly arrived IX Corps to counter this threat. On July 5, the day after the surrender of Vicksburg was made official; Sherman was free to move against Johnston. Johnston hastily withdrew his force across the Big Black River and Champion's Hill battlefields with Sherman in pursuit. Sherman had with him the IX Corps, XV Corps, XIII Corps, and a detachment of the XVI Corps. On July 10 the Union Army had taken up position around Jackson. The heaviest fighting in the Siege of Jackson came on July 11 during an unsuccessful Union attack, which resulted in heavy casualties.Gue, Benjamin F. History of Iowa From the Earliest Times to the Beginning of the Twentieth Century/4 Vol. 4. Iowa Biography, 1903, p. 164. Instead of risking entrapment, Johnston chose to evacuate the state capital and withdrew on July 16. Sherman's forces occupied the city the following day. In the aftermath of the Vicksburg Campaign, most of Johnston's army was transferred to the Army of Tennessee, arriving just in time for the Battle of Chickamauga. The 9th Arkansas remained in the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana and was eventually assigned to the mostly Alabama brigade of Brigadier General Abraham Buford, of Major General William J. Loring's Division of Lieutenant General Leonidas Polk's Army during the Meridian Campaign in February to March, 1864.United States. War Dept.

After the Meridian Campaign, the unit was assigned to Brigadier General D. H. Reynold's Brigade in the Army of Tennessee, where it would remain for the rest of the war. The unit participated in the campaigns of that army from the Atlanta Campaign at Resaca, New Hope Church, Kennesaw Mountain, Dug Gap, Peachtree Creek, Atlanta, Ezra Church, and the final siege of Atlanta, as well as follow-on action at Lovejoy's Station and Jonesboro, Georgia. After the fall of Atlanta, the regiment participated in the Tennessee campaign that resulted in the battles of Franklin, and Nashville, Tennessee. They continued service with the Army of Tennessee to the close of the war, fighting at Sugar Creek on December 26, 1864, and in the Carolinas Campaign in February to April, 1865.

After the Battle of Nashville, Tennessee, the Arkansas regiments of Reynolds' Brigade marched via Bainbridge, Alabama, Tuscumbia, Iuka and Corinth to Tupelo, Mississippi, where they went into camp on January 10, 1865. They departed Tupelo on January 30 and marched to West Point, Mississippi. From West Point they traveled by rail to Selma, Alabama. From Selma they traveled by steamboat to Montgomery, then by rail to Columbus, Georgia. From Columbus they marched via Macon and Milledgeville to Mayfield, Georgia. From Mayfield they traveled by rail to Augusta, Georgia. From there they marched to Newberry, South Carolina. On March 19, 1865, they fought their last major engagement at the Battle of Bentonville, North Carolina. They then marched to Smithfield, North Carolina, where the entire brigade was consolidated into a single understrength regiment, the 1st Consolidated Mounted Rifles on April 9, 1865.Howerton, Bryan R. \\"Re: 25 Infantry Company C\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 20 March 2005, Accessed 8 February 2012,  National Colors  National Colors (1863‚Äì65) The 9th Arkansas Infantry Regiment's national colors currently reside at the American Civil War Museum at Richmond.

After the surrender, the men were offered free rail transportation (where available) in the direction of their homes, by what was left of the Southern railway companies. Most of the men traveled by rail, where they could. A large number of men were killed or seriously injured in a railroad accident at Flat Creek Bridge, Tennessee, on May 25, 1865.

Sawyer. The first book, Wake, was published through Ace on April 7, 2009 and was followed by the second book, Watch, on April 6, 2010. Synopsis The trilogy follows Caitlin Decter, a brilliant young blind teenager whose disability is more of a benefit when surfing the Internet. A Japanese researcher offers Caitlin the ability to gain her sight via a revolutionary new implant, an offer she eagerly accepts. However, she's surprised when rather than showing her the ordinary world, Caitlin is now able to see the Internet and all it has to offer her. She comes across Webmind, a self-aware consciousness that is growing and evolving through the Internet. The two become friends but WATCH, a secret division of the US National Security Agency, is all too aware of Webmind's existence and is concerned over its potential threat to national security. However, even as Webmind shows how it can benefit mankind, the government believes that it is an entity that should be destroyed at all costs. Books #Wake (2009) #Watch (2010) #Wonder (2011) Development Sawyer was inspired to write the WWW Trilogy after reading an issue of New Scientist that remarked that in the early 21st century the world wide web \\"could have the same number of synapses as the human brain\\", which made him draw comparisons to human evolution. While writing, Sawyer had difficulty writing the character of Caitlin due to the two of them being so different, but stated that he felt that the challenge was \\"fun\\". As such, he conducted research on what it was like to be blind and received input from his nieces, which he used to help build the character of Caitlin. While writing the trilogy Sawyer also consulted a young adult librarian, as he wanted to \\"appeal to both the adult and YA markets with the WWW trilogy\\". He also tried to incorporate various different ethnicities in the work, as he noted that several science fiction works such as Star Wars and 2001 did not contain many or any non-Caucasian characters. Reception Critical reception for the WWW Trilogy has been predominantly positive and the series has received praise from outlets such as Publishers Weekly, SF Site, and SF Signal. Much of the praise centered on its characters and technology, and in their review of Wake, the SF Site commented that \\"Even with such a focus on technology and culture, Sawyer never loses sight of his individual characters.\\" Criticisms of the work tended to stem around Sawyer's usage of the trilogy to champion several different causes, which some reviewers felt detracted from their enjoyment of the work and did not help fully flesh out the characters.

The name translates roughly to English as \\"Workshops and Shipyard of the Loire\\".  Early years  In the eighteenth century Nantes had been the biggest French port, and the Loire had a major shipbuilding industry. A prime example was Dubigeon established in 1760. In the nineteenth century Nantes was surpassed by Le Havre and Marseille. In the first half of the nineteenth century a port was developed at Saint-Nazaire for ships that could no longer reach Nantes. In the second half of the nineteenth century industrialization got under way in Nantes and Saint-Nazaire. In 1861 a Scottish engineer founded the Chantiers de Penho√´t at Saint-Nazaire. Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire (ACL) was formed in 1881 in Nantes by Jollet Babin to take advantage of the expansion of the French Navy. The shipyard was built at Prairie du Lac, near the Dubigeon yard, and the following year, in 1882, a second yard was built at St Nazaire adjacent to the Chantiers de Penho√´t yard. From the outset ACL focused on building warships for the French Navy, laying down capital ships at the Saint-Nazaire site, closer to deep water, and medium‚Äìsized and small ships (cruisers, torpedo boats and, later, destroyers) at Nantes.  The battleship race to World War I  The engine and boiler factory at Saint-Denis In September 1892 ACL Saint-Nazaire laid down its first battleship, Mass√©na. It seemed that the plan to get involved in construction for the French navy had succeeded, but ACL would not lay down another battleship for ten years. In 1901 ACL took over Normandy-Laporte at Rouen and built a factory for marine boilers and marine steam engines at Saint-Denis near Paris. It was located at the confluence of the Seine and the Canal Saint- Denis, and could easily be reached by boat and by train. This might have helped to get back into the construction of battleships. Indeed the ambition to become a leading French builder of battleships started to succeed only a few years later. In November 1902 the Libert√© was laid down in Saint-Nazaire. In 1907 ACL at Saint-Nazaire laid down two of the six Danton-class battleships, Condorcet and Diderot. In 1911 it laid down one of the Courbet- class battleships, and in 1912 one of the three Bretagne-class battleships. A fourth Bretagne-class battleship was laid down for Greece in July 1914, but Vasilefs Konstantinos would never be finished. In between a ship of the Normandie-class had been laid down in April 1913.  World War I  Normandie under construction During the war battleship construction was not a priority, and so many parts of the unfinished ships were used for other ships. As a consequence the last two battleships that had been laid down at ACL were far from complete at the end of the war. By then their design was also a bit outdated, and it was decided not to finish the ships.  Interwar years   Shift to building merchant ships  Already before World War I ACL had started to built ocean liners. In March 1914 it had launched the ocean liner Sphinx (151 m, 11,375 tons) for Messageries Maritimes. After the War it was clear that there would not be many orders for big warships in the near future. The logical alternative use of the slipways at Saint Nazaire would be to continue and expand the construction ocean liners. In 1921 ACL launched SS Lipari (9,954 tons) for Chargeurs R√©unis. In March 1922 ACL launched SS Chantilly (152 m, 10828 tons), in November 1922 her sister SS Compi√®gne, and in November 1923 the third sister SS Fontainebleau. With the construction of these medium sized ocean liners the shipyard had successfully diversified into the market for civilian ships. This was all the more important because the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 made it clear that no more battleships would be built in the near future. Of course ACL wanted to expand in the construction of bigger ocean liners. In the early 1920s there had been abandoned negotiations for an ocean liner with the Dutch Netherland Line or SMN. In 1923 a new tender was held by the SMN, and ACL offered for such a low price that it got the order for MS Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft, an ocean liner of 14.642 tons (21,000 tons displacement). The offer was made possible by an extremely low exchange rate of the French Franc, which had not yet been translated in increased cost. The order was also important for ACL because it was a Motor Ship, driven by Diesel engines P.C. Hooft would twice catch fire on the yard. ACL faced severe troubles to finish the ship in time, and in July 1926 she sailed to Amsterdam to be finished over there. In 1932 she was lost in a fire. In 1929 ACL laid down the ocean liner MS Georges Philippar. She was of a size comparable to that of P.C. Hooft, but profited from advances in Diesel engine technology, making her much faster. Georges Philippar was launched in November 1930, and was burned and lost on the return voyage of her first trip in May 1932.  Diversification  Also in the inter-war years ACL diversified into naval aviation, forming an aircraft manufacturing division in 1925 It became Loire Aviation in 1930. The factory in Saint-Denis would employ up to 1,200 people in the 1920s. It built turrets and other armored parts for the Maginot line.  Re-entry in the battleship market  Before World War II, ACL co-operated with Chantiers de Penho√´t in building two of France‚Äôs four battleships, and had contracts for another, and two aircraft carriers, but these were not completed.  Post World War II  After World War II and a decline in shipbuilding, ACL intensified its links with Chantiers de Penho√´t, and the two companies merged in 1955 to form Chantiers de l'Atlantique.

History and functions The Patria of Constantinople mention an ostiarios named Antiochos in the 6th century at the time of Emperor Justinian I (r. 527‚Äì565), and a 7th-century seal records an ostiarios and koubikoularios (servant of the imperial bedchamber)... As a pure dignity, to be held alongside proper offices, the ostiarios is first recorded in historical sources for the year 787. By this time, the title seems to have become firmly established as a dignity, although there is still mention of it being an active function, such as in Philotheos's Kletorologion of 899 of an \\"imperial ostiarios\\" performing the duties of an usher.. The dignity was an awarded title (Œ¥Œπ·Ω∞ Œ≤œÅŒ±Œ≤ŒµŒØŒøœÖ ·ºÄŒæŒØŒ±, dia brabeiou axia), with a gold band with a jewelled handle as its characteristic insigne, whose award (Œ≤œÅŒ±Œ≤ŒµŒØŒøŒΩ, brabeion) also conferred the dignity. It was the fourth-lowest dignity for eunuchs, above the spatharokoubikoularios and below the primikerios, and was reserved specifically for them.. It was most frequently awarded to mid-level civil functionaries, such as the protonotarioi. The dignity is last mentioned in 1086. Nicolas Oikonomides concludes that it must have disappeared by the end of the 11th century, although another ostiarios is mentioned in 1174 and some seals have been dated to the 12th and possibly even the 13th century.

The Stars were one of the league's initial eight teams. The Stars were defunct after its initial season. To attract fans, the ABA had rosters with former National Basketball Association (NBA) players and past college basketball stars with local ties. The Stars used their territorial draft picks to select Ed O'Bannon and Tyus Edney, who won the 1995 NCAA championship together at UCLA. O'Bannon, a former first-round draft pick in the 1995 NBA Draft, would play for the Stars, while Edney played for the Indiana Pacers in the NBA that season. O'Bannon would be joined on the Stars by former UCLA players Toby Bailey, who also played with O'Bannon on the 1995 championship team, and JaRon Rush. The Stars' head coach was former Los Angeles Lakers and Loyola Marymount head coach Paul Westhead, while former UC Irvine star Scott Brooks was an assistant coach as well as a player on the Stars. Former Lakers star Jamaal Wilkes was hired as vice president of basketball operations. His former college coach at UCLA, the legendary John Wooden, agreed to join the Stars as a consultant at Wilkes' request. The team's record was 28‚Äì13 in 2000‚Äì2001, and their season ended with a 112‚Äì132 first-round playoff loss to the Kansas City Knights.

He has been referred to as Australia's greatest ever wheelchair tennis player. Biography Born in Sydney, Australia, Hall was raised in the New South Wales coastal town of Budgewoi, attending Budgewoi Public School and Northlakes High School. On 11 October 1986, at the age of 16, Hall lost his legs after being hit by a car. After a long period of rehabilitation, Hall began working as a clerk at the local police station. It was around this time that Hall was looking through the local paper and saw a picture of a Terry Mason in a wheelchair playing tennis. Hall had played tennis growing up and at the age of 13 and 14 had been Club Champion at his local tennis club under the coaching supervision of Guy Melmeth. Inspired, Hall began to play and entered his first wheelchair tennis competition, the 'Albury-Wodonga Classic', in 1988. This led to him competing in his first Australian Open in February 1989. Playing in the C division, Hall won. The following year, Hall participated in his first international competition and turned professional in 1993. 1995 saw Hall relocate to the United States. The year culminated with Hall winning the US Open Singles title and being ranked number one in the world. Tennis career Hall serves the ball during 2000 Summer Paralympics match In his career, Hall won all of the major world titles and was ranked as the world number one player for six years. He won Paralympic gold, silver and bronze medals and 18 Super Series titles. He was a member of Australia's World Cup winning teams in 1994, 1996, 2000 and 2002. He was ranked World No 1 for eight of the years between 1995 and 2005. Between 1995 and 2005 he won the Australian Open Wheelchair tennis title nine times, the British Open seven times, the US Open eight times, and the Japan Open eight times. For most of his tennis career, Hall was coached by Rich Berman. He was an Australian Institute of Sport scholarship holder from 1995 to 2000. Professional career Hall played professionally for more than a decade before officially retiring from competition in 2006. He announced his retirement from the NEC Wheelchair Tennis Tour in June 2006. He won the NEC Singles Masters titles in 2002 and 2004. Australian Open Hall won eight Australian Opens in the men's singles wheelchair event. He first won the men's single wheelchair event at the Australian Open in 1996. That same year, he also won the men's doubles with his partner, Mick Connell. He won his first British Open in 1995. British Open Hall won seven British Opens in the men's singles wheelchair event. Japan Open He won the Japan Open eight times. US Open Hall won eight US Opens in the men's singles wheelchair event. Six of these wins were between 1995 and 2002. In 2005, Japan's Shingo Kunieda beat David Hall in the quarter finals of the US Open. Hall was the first non- American to win the U.S. Open Super Series title. He won five of these eight titles in a row between 2000 and 2004. His 2005 run was ended because France's Michael Jeremiasz won that year. Hall did well in 1999, only having been beaten by the American Steve Welch in the finals. Paralympic Games Hall during a match at the 1996 Atlanta Paralympics Hall on the podium celebrating his gold medal win at the 2000 Summer Paralympics Hall represented Australia at the Paralympic Games four times; First in 1992 at Barcelona, Atlanta in 1996, where he won a silver medal in the doubles and a bronze medal in the singles, Sydney in 2000, where he won a gold medal in the singles and a silver medal in the doubles, and Athens in 2004, where he won a silver medal in the singles and a bronze medal in the doubles. He received a Medal of the Order of Australia for his 2000 gold medal. Other Events He competed in more than seventy other tournaments. In 2013, 6-time World Champion David Hall, together with his long-time coach Rich Berman, released a comprehensive video tutorial of all the basics of playing wheelchair tennis titled Let's Roll - Learning Wheelchair Tennis with the Pros. Awards and non-tennis career Hall's accomplishments culminated in him being inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 2010. In 2010, he was one of only three Paralympians to have been given the honour. Hall was inducted into the New South Wales Hall of Champions in 2009. In 2010 Hall was appointed an ambassador for wheelchair tennis by the International Tennis Federation to help promote the sport in Australia and worldwide. In 2011, Hall will sit on the selection panel for the Newcombe Medal Award for Most Outstanding Athlete with a Disability. Hall was a writer for Sports 'n Spokes Magazine. He also works for Tennis Australia in promoting and raising awareness of wheelchair tennis within Australia. As part of a Sydney Morning Herald report in 2009, Hall toured the city of Sydney to explore the city's wheelchair accessibility. Hall highlighted some of the frustrations of using public transport. During the Australian Tennis Open in 2015, he was inducted into the Australian Tennis Hall of Fame. In July 2015, Hall was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame In April 2016, he was awarded the International Tennis Federation's Brad Parks Award for his significant contribution to wheelchair tennis on an international basis.

She is a Distinguished Professor of Chemistry at Texas A&M; University. Her current work focuses on iron hydrogenases and iron nitrosyl complexes. Education Darensbourg received a B.S. in Chemistry from Union College in 1963, and a Ph.D. in inorganic chemistry from the University of Illinois under the guidance of Theodore L. Brown in 1967. Her doctoral work focused on the kinetic studies of organolithium reactions. Career Darensbourg was an assistant professor at Vassar College from 1967‚Äì1969. From 1971‚Äì1982, she taught at Tulane University, attaining the rank of professor. In 1982, Marcetta Darensbourg was appointed professor at Texas A&M; University together with Donald J. Darensbourg. She was subsequently awarded the title of Distinguished Professor in 2010. Her research interests include bimetallic hydrogenase enzymes containing CO and CN ligands. Darensbourg sits on the board of Inorganic Syntheses, where she also served as the editor-in-chief of volume 32. In 2011, she was elected fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.  Research projects  Organolithium chemistry Darensbourg investigated certain kinetic aspects of organolithium compounds. During the course of these studies, the kinetics of the rate-determining step of tert- butyllithium dissociation from tetramer to a dimer were analyzed. Using mass spectroscopy, the existence of cross-association with other organolithium species in the vapor phase could also be observed. 468x468px  Metal carbonyl chemistry  Darensbourg's interest in charge distribution molecules that could be probed with reactivity led to her work on mapping nucleophilic attack on metal carbonyls. Infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance and electronic spectroscopy of some carbene pentacarbonyl complexes of chromium(0) and tungsten(0) indicated that carbene ligands are better sigma donors than a carbonyl ligand, while simultaneously behaving as strong pi acceptors. Substitutions of iron and cobalt sites were made to see how the CO strength force constants affected the nucleophilic attacks. The substitutions illustrated that the nucleophilic attacks always occurred at the CO group with the greater force constant when there is a choice of carbonyl groups present in a molecule.  Hydrogenase mimics  Darensbourg has pioneered the development of synthetic mimics of hydrogenase enzymes. These include synthetic complexes featuring Fe-based organometallics species, which serve as precursor for producing iron only Hydrogenase enzyme active site. These enzymes are capable of carry out reaction even in the absence of the protein- based active site organization or carry out the proton production with high efficiencies. However, these hydrogenase enzymes were found to be highly sensitive with oxygen (O2), which can over oxidize and inactivate them. Even after the oxygen was removed, they do not regain catalytic activity immediately, requiring multiple steps to do so.  Metallodithiolates chemistry 529x529px In the beginning of 2017, Darensbourg shifted her focus to studying the metallodithiolates ligands, which act as building blocks for the synthesis of various bimetallic enzyme active sites. The ligands can act as a catalyst to carry out different reactions, depending on which transition metal being at the center. Darensbourg et al. reported that metallodithiolates ligands with nickel centers can increase the electron density of bonds such as Fe-S, allowing them to be cleaved easily. Darensbourg et al. also determined that this nickel center complex associated with a lead atom also plays an important role in the addition of CO and ethylene in the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction, which couples the organic compounds of boron and the halides, along alkyl halides and alkylboranes. Furthermore, with the cCobalt center, the metallodithiolates ligands can catalyze the transfer of NO and nitrosylate moieties, which allows the glycosidase conjugation of dinitrosyl iron complexes. With this conjugation, other carbohydrates can achieve higher potential in attaching for drug delivery.

The municipalities of Cully, Epesses, Grandvaux, Riex and Villette (Lavaux) merged on 1 July 2011 into the new municipality of Bourg-en-Lavaux.Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz published by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office accessed 17 February 2011 History Aerial view: Villette, Grandvaux (1948) Aerial view, from left to right: Cully, Riex, Epesses (1960) The first written mention of Cully took place in 967 under the name Cusliacum. Epesses is first mentioned in 1453 as Espesses. Grandvaux is first mentioned in 1250 as de Gravaz. In 1445 it was mentioned as Grandvaulx. Riex is first mentioned in 1184 as Ruez. Cully The earliest traces of human activity in Cully comes from the Neolithic, when Lake Geneva was near the modern port of Moratel. During the Roman Empire, the route from Lausanne to Great Saint Bernard ran through the area. From this time, some walls and coins have been found preserved. The first written mention of the place took place in 967 under the name Cusliacum. Later appeared the names Cusliaco (12th century),Custiacum (1154),Cullie (1226),Cully (1275)and Culyer (1383 ). The origin of the name is not clearly understood. It is possibly derived from the Roman family name Coclius. The first document involving Cully, saw it given to the King of Besan√ßon. However, because Cully at the same time was under Villett parishe, which belonged to the bishop of Lausanne, there were constant disputes which led in 1246 to it being given back to the bishop of Lausanne. In the 14th Century the inhabitants the acquired the right to hold a weekly market and fortify the village. With the conquest of Vaud by Bern in 1536, Cully came under the administration of the Bailiwick of Lausanne. After the collapse of the Ancien r√©gime, the village belonged from 1798 to 1803 during the Helvetic Republic to the Canton of L√©man. In 1798 Cully Lavaux became the capital of the district, as it was in the central part of the district. It was not until 1824, that Cully attained the status of an independent political community. A project to merge the independent municipalities Cully, Epesses, Riex, Grandvaux, and Villette (Lavaux) failed in a vote on 27 February 2005 due to the resistance of the population of Grandvaux but was finally complete on 1 July 2011. Epesses Traces of a Roman road and coins finds indicate an early settlement in the municipality. The name Epesses comes from the Latin word spissa (meaning dense, thick) probably in reference to the spruce. With the conquest by Bern of Vaud in 1536, the village came under the administration of the Bailiwick of Lausanne. After the collapse of the ancien r√©gime, between 1798 and 1803 it was part of the Canton of L√©man during the Helvetic Republic and then fell under the Canton of Vaud. In 1798 it was assigned to the district of Lavaux. It was not until 1824, when the community was split from Villette, that Epesses attained the status of an independent political municipality. A project to merge the independent municipalities Cully, Epesses, Riex, Grandvaux, and Villette failed in a vote on 27 February 2005 due to the resistance of the population of Grandvaux, yet it was finally completed on 1 July 2011.

An Imperial force commanded by Aeneas de Caprara was marching towards Heidelberg, in order to join their main army under Alexander von Bournonville. It was intercepted just outside Sinsheim by the French commanded by Turenne; the Imperialists repulsed the first two French assaults but were eventually forced to retreat. Background Turenne, French commander in the Rhineland In the 1667-1668 War of Devolution, France captured most of the Spanish Netherlands and Franche-Comt√©, before the Triple Alliance of the Dutch Republic, England and Sweden forced them to relinquish most of these gains in the 1668 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. Angered by what Louis XIV viewed as Dutch ingratitude for previous French support, in May 1672 French forces invaded the Dutch Republic. They initially seemed to have achieved an overwhelming victory but by late July, the Dutch position had stabilised and they received support from Brandenburg-Prussia, Emperor Leopold and the Spanish Empire. After this was formalised by the August 1673 Treaty of the Hague, a new front opened in the Rhineland and Turenne appointed French commander. At the end of 1673, French troops withdrew from the Dutch Republic; the main objectives for 1674 were to retake Franche-Comt√© and key fortresses along the French border with the Spanish Netherlands. Turenne was tasked with preventing the Imperialists entering Alsace but decided the best way to do that was to attack. On 14 June, he crossed the Rhine near Philippsburg, seeking to intercept an Imperial force under Aeneas de Caprara before it could link up with Alexander von Bournonville. On 16 June, Turenne caught Caprara outside Sinsheim and brought him to battle. Zabecki, David p. 1089 The battle Caprara aligned his infantry along the hedgerows and gardens at the entrance of the village. Turenne deployed his infantry and his dragoons on foot. They forced the outposts, crossed the Elsanz and entered Sinsheim. The Imperials retreated through the village and fell back on the plateau behind the village. To reach the plateau, the French had to climb a narrow passage. Turenne positioned infantry and dragoons in the hedgerows flanking the narrow passage, as well as in the castle and in the vineyard. The French cavalry could then advance through the passage. An enemy counter-attack was stopped by the covering fire of the French infantry. The Imperials were repelled from the plateau and withdrew. Turenne immediately left Sinsheim to monitor the bulk of the Imperial army, stationed on the Moselle. There were 2,000 to 3,000 deaths, according to sources. The city was completely destroyed. Aftermath The battle was only a limited success for Turenne, because both enemy forces succeeded in uniting near Heidelberg. On 1 July the Elector of Brandenburg also took up arms against France, and the Perpetual Diet of Regensburg declared war. Turenne again crossed the Rhine and ravaged the Palatinate (July 1674), depriving the Imperials the resources to attack the Alsace.

The municipalities of Fontanezier, Romairon, Vaugondry and Villars-Burquin merged on 1 July 2011 into the new municipality of T√©venon.Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz published by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office accessed 17 February 2011 History Before 2011, T√©venon, a municipality that is also known as \\"Pied-de-la-C√¥te\\", was made up of 4 different municipalities: Villars-Burquin, Vaugondry, Romairon, and Fontanezier. Romairon and Fontanezier were first mentioned in the 15th century. In 1897, a church was built in Villars-Burquin and a parish was created in the four municipalities in order to bring their populations closer together. Vaugondry and Villars-Burquin were both part of larger places but separated respectively from a lordship in Grandson, Switzerland in 1730 and from \\"M√©tralie de Fiez\\" in 1844 but merged with the other two municipalities, Romairon and Fontanezier in 2011 to form the municipality of T√©venon. In September 2009 the four municipalities voted for a merge. 75% of the population agreed to the merge which was accepted and implemented on 1 July 2011.http://www.vd.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/organisation/gc/fichiers_pdf/256_Decret_adopte_new.pdf One of the main reasons the municipalities wanted to merge was because of the size of each individual municipality. It was hard to find people interested in the political life of each of the municipalities and it was getting hard to run.http://www.faovd.ch/alphabet/index/commune/10_tevenon It is because of these small efforts to create a bond within the region of \\"Pied-de-la-C√¥te\\" that such a large proportion of the population voted yes to the merging of the four municipalities. Geography After the four municipalities fused in 2011 it gave T√©venon a surface area of 1426 ha (14.26 square km). Villars-Burquin had a surface area of 481 ha (4.81 square km), Vaugondry had one of 84 ha (0.84 square km), Romairaon had one of 489 ha (4.89 square km) and Fontanezier had one of 372 ha (3.72 square km). The total surface area put it in 41st place on the list of municipalities in the canton of Vaud by size. Approximately 53% of this area is made up of forests but there are also numerous prairies thanks to T√©venon's high altitude which culminates at 1432m (at la Joux Dessus). T√©venon's lowest point is at 550m giving the municipality an average height of 749m. T√©venon, Switzerland Weather During the coldest months, even the lowest parts of T√©venon get some snow. But, in the spring, the temperatures rise and in the summer, the temperature in T√©venon is usually only 3 to 4 degrees lower than the temperatures in the main land. The yearly average of the temperature in T√©venon in the year of 2014 was 12 ¬∞C. In the winter, the temperatures tended stay at 0 ¬∞C or just below 0 ¬∞C. During the summer, the temperatures weren't very high. In the earlier months of summer, the temperatures of T√©venon were just above 0 ¬∞C,but got up to 9 ¬∞C in the hottest months of the year. Accessibility Villars-Burquin is situated on the cantonal road Grandson ‚Äì Mauborget ‚Äì Sainte-Croix, while Vaugondry and Fontanezier can be reached with the roads coming respectively from Champagne and Bonvillars. Romairon can attained be the road from Fontanezier Religion From the census done in all of the municipalities in 2000, we can conclude that more than half of the population that would have been T√©venon's population had the merge happened sooner, would have been part of the Swiss reformed church at that point in time. http://www.pxweb.bfs.admin.ch/Database/German_40%20-%20Eidgen√∂ssische%20Volksz√§hlung/40.3%20-%202000/40.3%20-%202000.asp?lang=1‚àè=40&secprod;=3&openChild;=true Demographics As of 2009, T√©venon had a population of 696 people (556 in Villars-Burquin, 38 in Vaugondry. 39 in Romairon and 63 in Fontanezier) of which 88% are Swiss and the remaining 12% are of foreign origin. 15% of the total population are under 18 years old.

Villars-Burquin achieved the construction of a fire station, and Fontanezier's budget was devoted to important sums for the installation of a wastewater network for the farms situated on the top of the village. The bill, which has been demanded by the state, was rather difficult to accept for Fontanezier and they're municipality have had to consider a few years of cushioning. Vaugondry and Romairon's municipalities didn't have a very good budget, and therefore were not able to assist in the financial cost of the wastewater network. In the 3 smallest town, the tax rate used to be at 85%, while Villard-Burquin's was at 77%. The biggest town's tax rate became the new one, when they fused together to become T√©venon. This shows how Villars-Burquin's economy and its impact was much more important than the other villages. It has since been changed to 73%. T√©venon's fire station. Sectors of economic activity in 2000 hover to see more details According to the chart, the majority of Romairon's population works in the Primary sector. Whereas, Villars-Burquin had a majority of people working in the Tertiary sector. In fact, Romairon's inhabitants work as farmers in the proximity of their home, while Villard-Burquin's population prefers to work in another city. Contrary to popular belief, T√©venon's population doesn't have a majority of farmers. 77% of the population stated that they worked more than 10 km away from their home, and chose to live there because of its geographical position.\\"Une fusion intercommunale‚Ä¶\\".

She later signed a deal with Caroline Records/Astralwerks, releasing a psychedelic record for Astralwerks and a more folky record for Caroline Records. In her later years she moved to Los Angeles and signed to Alias Records, recording three records for them. Husik disappeared from the music scene until she self-released a new single to digital outlets in 2006.  History  Lida Husik was born in 1963 in Washington, DC. Starting in third grade, she learned violin and performed in her grade school band, Lafayette Elementary School orchestra. Eventually she taught herself how to play the drums and joined the punk band the Mourning Glories. During her brief time with the band, Husik learned about 4-track recording and decided to pursue a career as a solo artist. Eventually Don Fleming, frontman of the Velvet Monkeys, introduced her to producer Kramer. Through Shimmy Disc, Kramer's record label, Husik released her debut album Bozo. At this point she had taught herself how to play several instruments including the guitar, bass guitar, and piano. In 1994, she caught the attention of Beaumont Hannant, a British producer and DJ and collaborated with him on projects.

It is useful for molecules of up to 100 nucleotides, and as of 2003, nearly half of all known RNA structures had been determined by NMR spectroscopy. NMR has advantages over X-ray crystallography, which is the other method for high-resolution nucleic acid structure determination, in that the molecules are being observed in their natural solution state rather than in a crystal lattice that may affect the molecule's structural properties. It is also possible to investigate dynamics with NMR. This comes at the cost of slightly less accurate and detailed structures than crystallography. Nucleic acid NMR uses techniques similar to those of protein NMR, but has several differences. Nucleic acids have a smaller percentage of hydrogen atoms, which are the atoms usually observed in NMR, and because nucleic acid double helices are stiff and roughly linear, they do not fold back on themselves to give \\"long-range\\" correlations. Nucleic acids also tend to have resonances distributed over a smaller range than proteins, making the spectra potentially more crowded and difficult to interpret.  Experimental methods  Two- dimensional NMR methods are almost always used with nucleic acids. These include correlation spectroscopy (COSY) and total coherence transfer spectroscopy (TOCSY) to detect through-bond nuclear couplings, and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) to detect couplings between nuclei that are close to each other in space. The types of NMR usually done with nucleic acids are 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 15N NMR, and 31P NMR. 19F NMR is also useful if nonnatural nucleotides such as 2'-fluoro-2'-deoxyadenosine are incorporated into the nucleic acid strand, as natural nucleic acids do not contain any fluorine atoms. 1H and 31P have near 100% natural abundance, while 13C and 15N have low natural abundances. For these latter two nuclei, there is the capability of isotopically enriching desired atoms within the molecules, either uniformly or in a site-specific manner. Nucleotides uniformly enriched in 13C and/or 15N can be obtained through biochemical methods, by performing polymerase chain reaction using dNTPs or NTPs derived from bacteria grown in an isotopically enriched environment. Site-specific isotope enrichment must be done through chemical synthesis of the labeled nucleoside phosphoramidite monomer and of the full strand; however these are difficult and expensive to synthesize. Because nucleic acids have a relatively large number of protons which are solvent-exchangeable, nucleic acid NMR is generally not done in D2O solvent as is common with other types of NMR. This is because the deuterium in the solvent would replace the exchangeable protons and extinguish their signal. H2O is used as a solvent, and other methods are used to eliminate the strong solvent signal, such as saturating the solvent signal before the normal pulse sequence (\\"presaturation\\"), which works best a low temperature to prevent exchange of the saturated solvent protons with the nucleic acid protons; or exciting only resonances of interest (\\"selective excitation\\"), which has the additional, potentially undesired effect of distorting the peak amplitudes.  Structure determination  The exchangeable and non- exchangeable protons are usually assigned to their specific peaks as two independent groups. For exchangeable protons, which are for the most part the protons involved in base pairing, NOESY can be used to find through-space correlations between on neighboring bases, allowing an entire duplex molecule to be assigned through sequential walking. For nonexchangable protons, many of which are on the sugar moiety of the nucleic acid, COSY and TOCSY are used to identify systems of coupled nuclei, while NOESY is again used to correlate the sugar to the base and each base to its neighboring base. For duplex DNA nonexchangeable protons the H6/H8 protons on the base correlate to their counterparts on neighboring bases and to the H1' proton on the sugar, allowing sequential walking to be done. For RNA, the differences in chemical structure and helix geometry make this assignment more technically difficult, but still possible. The sequential walking methodology is not possible for non-double helical nucleic acid structures, nor for the Z-DNA form, making assignment of resonances more difficult. Parameters taken from the spectrum, mainly NOESY cross-peaks and coupling constants, can be used to determine local structural features such as glycosidic bond angles, dihedral angles (using the Karplus equation), and sugar pucker conformations. The presence or absence of imino proton resonances, or of coupling between 15N atoms across a hydrogen bond, indicates the presence or absence of basepairing. For large-scale structure, these local parameters must be supplemented with other structural assumptions or models, because errors add up as the double helix is traversed, and unlike with proteins, the double helix does not have a compact interior and does not fold back upon itself. However, long-range orientation information can be obtained through residual dipolar coupling experiments in a medium which imposes a weak alignment on the nucleic acid molecules. Recently, solid-state NMR methodology has been introduced for the structure determination of nucleic acids. The protocol implies two approaches: nucleotide-type selective labeling of RNA and usage of heteronuclear correlation experiments. NMR is also useful for investigating nonstandard geometries such as bent helices, non- Watson‚ÄìCrick basepairing, and coaxial stacking. It has been especially useful in probing the structure of natural RNA oligonucleotides, which tend to adopt complex conformations such as stem-loops and pseudoknots. Interactions between RNA and metal ions can be probed by a number of methods, including observing changes in chemical shift upon ion binding, observing line broadening for paramagnetic ion species, and observing intermolecular NOE contacts for organometallic mimics of the metal ions. NMR is also useful for probing the binding of nucleic acid molecules to other molecules, such as proteins or drugs. This can be done by chemical-shift mapping, which is seeing which resonances are shifted upon binding of the other molecule, or by cross- saturation experiments where one of the binding molecules is selectively saturated and, if bound, the saturation transfers to the other molecule in the complex. Dynamic properties such as duplex‚Äìsingle strand equilibria and binding rates of other molecules to duplexes can also be determined by its effect on the spin‚Äìlattice relaxation time T1, but these methods are insensitive to intermediate rates of 104‚Äì108 s‚àí1, which must be investigated with other methods such as solid-state NMR. Dynamics of mechanical properties of a nucleic acid double helix such as bending and twisting can also be studied using NMR. Pulsed field gradient NMR experiments can be used to measure diffusion constants.  History  Nucleic acid NMR studies were performed as early as 1971, and focused on using the low-field imino proton resonances to probe base pairing interactions. These early studies focussed on tRNA because these nucleic acids were the only samples available at that time with low enough molecular weight that the NMR spectral line-widths were practical. The study focussed on the low-field protons because they were the only protons that could be reliably observed in aqueous solution using the best spectrometers available at that time. It was quickly realized that spectra of the low-field imino protons were providing clues to the tertiary structure of tRNA in solution. The first NMR spectrum of a double-helical DNA was published in 1977 using a synthetic, 30-base-pair double helix. To overcome sever line-broadening in native DNA, sheer-degraded natural DNA was prepared and studied to learn about the persistence length of double-helical DNA. At the same time, nucleosome core particles were studied to gain further insight of the flexibility of the double helix. The first NMR spectra reported for a uniform low molecular weight native-sequence DNA, made with restriction enzymes, was reported 1981. This work was also the first report of nucleic acid NMR spectra obtained at high field. Two dimensional NMR studies began to be reported in 1982 and then, with the advent of oligonucleotide synthesis and more sophisticated instrumentation, many detailed structural studies were reported starting in 1983.

Shuttle trains run from Sanayi to Seyrantepe to T√ºrk Telekom Arena. The M2 line has a total length of and has a daily ridership of 320,000 making it the busiest and second longest line of the Istanbul Metro system. Only the M1 line has a longer route length. History Construction for a north-south metro line started on 19 August 1992 when the groundbreaking of the M2 took place. The original route was a wholly underground line between Taksim and 4. Levent. Construction of the tunnels took place in three separate areas; Taksim, ≈ûi≈üli and 4. Levent. These tunnels were connected to each other on 8 July 1994 and were completed on 30 April 1995. The line was completed in early 11 January 1999 and the first rolling stock were lowered into the tunnels. On 25 March 1999 the first test runs began and the line entered service on 16 September 2000 between Taksim and Levent. 4. Levent was opened one month later on 24 October 2000.

City of Los Angeles, 25 June 2010. Web. 19 July 2011. After the study by the Amnesty International Medical Group was completed, Quiroga presented it to the American Psychological Association. This was among the first research on the medical and psychological consequences of torture. Quiroga and Deutsch quickly became known as professionals treating victims of torture. It wasn't until 1987, years after PTV began, that the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment was enforced and torture was legally recognized and defined for the first time Quiroga and Deutsch began to treat clients in local clinics and in their own homes. Partnering with organizations such as Clinica Monse√±or Oscar A. Romero, El Rescate, CARECEN and Amanecer, PTV quickly became well known in the Central American refugee community. Quiroga, having already been a volunteer at Venice Family Clinic for years, formed a partnership in which he was able to use their facilities to see PTV patients. Based in a small apartment at the time, Venice Family Clinic is now the largest community clinic in the U.S. and still home to PTV's medical office. In 1994, PTV received its first grant from the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture and was incorporated as a 501 (c)3 non-profit organization. Several years later, in 2000, PTV received a federal grant for $2 million over a four-year period, allowing PTV to add staff and relocate the administrative office from Ms. Deutsch's home to downtown Los Angeles. With paid staff and a central office, PTV was finally able to expand its scope to include areas like research and evaluation.

(1998). p. 170. His father was a local merchant and businessman. From early on his parents put great emphasis on and were very supportive of his education. They sent him to Christian schools and provided him with tutors. Given the government sanctioned segregation at the time, the type of proactive stance towards education that Beckham‚Äôs parents took was really the only way for an African American to get a quality education. The battle with educational segregation only worsened when Beckham began to look towards higher education. College education in the south was almost not an option for African Americans at this time, moving north was a necessity. In 1915, he graduated from Lincoln University in Chester County, Pennsylvania, with a bachelor's degree, then received a second bachelor's degree from Ohio State University in 1916. He received his master's degree in Psychology in 1917 and subsequently his PhD in psychology from New York University. Beckham eventually earned a Ph.D. in educational psychology and began working for the Institute for Juvenile Research.Graves, Scott (2009) It was working at the institute that he met his wife, Ruth Howard. She, too, was a psychologist working at the institute. Education At the age of 15, Beckham enrolled at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania. At Lincoln, Beckham studied alongside Francis Sumner, graduating with a bachelor's degree in psychology in 1915. Moving quickly through academic paths that had not been traveled by many African Americans before him, Beckham enrolled in Ohio State University where he earned a second bachelor's degree in 1916 and then a master's degree in psychology the following year.Guthrie, (1998) At this point, Beckham‚Äôs education was interrupted by his call to serve his country. From 1917 until 1920, Beckham worked as a professor at Wilberforce University at the direction of U.S. armed forces. In 1921, after concluding his service, Beckham enrolled at Columbia University to pursue a doctorate degree in psychology. After taking some courses at Columbia, Beckham transferred to New York University because it offered better financial aid. Beckham continued his studies at NYU until 1924, when he accepted a position as a professor at Howard University.Guthrie (1998) In 1928, Beckham returned to NYU and continued his doctorate work. In 1930, Beckham was awarded a Ph.D. in educational psychology from New York University‚Äôs School of Education. Career Beckham became a professor of psychology, somewhat unintentionally, at the age of twenty. Beckham did not seek out his first teaching job. Immediately after completing his master's degree, Beckham enlisted in the Air Force with aspirations to be a pilot in World War I. Beckham‚Äôs application came during a time of serious segregation within the armed forces. The Air Force rejected Beckham‚Äôs application; it would be decades before an African American became an Air Force pilot. After persistent inquiry, the Air Force told Beckham that he could best serve his country by being a War Professor of Psychology at Wilberforce University. Beckham remained at Wilberforce, a private university that served African Americans, from 1917 until 1920. From 1920 until 1924, Beckham studied at Columbia University and New York University. During this time he was the editor of a newspaper called the New York City Dispatch, he also worked closely with the New York public schools. In 1924, Beckham took a position as the first psychology professor at Howard University. He began as an instructor but later became an assistant professor, he taught a wide variety of psychology courses at Howard. Beckham‚Äôs greatest impact on the Howard psychology department was the laboratory he founded‚Äîthe first of its kind at a Black university. One of the first and most prominent courses of study in the laboratory regarded intelligence differences in children of different ethnicities. As mainstream psychology made claims about the intellectual inferiority of African American children, Beckham‚Äôs lab conducted research to refute these studies. The laboratory was also used for individual consultations with the school districts in Washington D.C. Beckham‚Äôs work with the school districts helped to establish a relationship between Howard and the surrounding public schools. In 1928, Beckham left Howard to continue his doctorate studies. After earning his doctorate, Beckham took a job the Institute for Juvenile Research, which was devoted to researching and resolving juvenile delinquency. In the time that he was at the institute, Beckham served as a Fellow of the National Committee for Mental Health and as a Senior Assistant Research Psychologist. The organization provided delinquent children with psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers. It was also used to administer tests, provide training for teachers, and evaluate other clinics. Due to pay cuts that were the result of the Great Depression, Beckham left his job at the institute in 1935. The job search proved difficult. Beckham applied to work for the Chicago Board of Education, but there were not many jobs at the time. Additionally, being African American made finding work more difficult. Beckham was the first choice for the board of education, but he was not actually hired until the National Urban League pressured the city to hire him. The director of the board sent him to work at DuSable High School in Chicago. Beckham became the school psychologist at DuSable, establishing one of the first public school psychological clinics. DuSable served primarily African American students. At DuSable. Beckham created a clinic for parents to give them support in raising their adolescents and created programs that involved local churches. In this way he developed a strong community at DuSable, a high school that served a large low-income housing development. Beckham worked for the board of education until his death in 1964 and conducted a great deal of research simultaneously. Additionally, Beckham and his wife, Ruth Howard, had a private practice called the Center for Psychological Services throughout most of their married life. Areas of study Beckham‚Äôs scholarly work largely focused on education; however, he also conducted studies on topics such as albinism, narcolepsy, race attitudes, and life satisfaction Despite never holding a position at a university after completing his doctorate, Beckham was a prolific researcher. Intelligence testing One of Beckham‚Äôs areas of interest was intelligence testing. This came out of necessity because mainstream psychology was claiming that African Americans were intellectually inferior due to the disparities in intelligence test scores in African American and Caucasian children. Beckham‚Äôs generation of African American psychologists had a different relationship to the intelligence test than post-civil rights era psychologists. Beckham and his colleagues saw the intelligence test as a tool that, if used correctly, could debunk the myth of Black inferiority. They did not question the test itself, rather they focused on matching background variables and building rapport between the testers and those taking the test. The majority of the researchers in this time, Beckham included, argued that environmental differences were the cause of the intelligence score disparities. Some of Beckham‚Äôs studies regarding intelligence testing include: ‚ÄúThe intelligence of a Negro high school population in a northern city‚Äù (1939) and ‚ÄúA study of the intelligence of different social-economic status in typical metropolitan areas‚Äù (1933). The 1933 study showed that intelligence scores and social-economic status were significantly correlated. This was an important finding as it detracted support from the theory that African Americans were intellectually inferior. One of Beckham‚Äôs most influential studies regarded intelligence outside of an educational framework. ‚ÄúMinimum intelligence levels for several occupations‚Äù (1930) was a study that looked at the IQ score needed to fulfill certain menial labor positions. Beckham looked at the abilities of people with mental ages from five to twelve and assessed their ability to fulfill certain tasks. For example, Beckham found that boys with a mental age of five could handle cinders and garbage, while boys with a mental age of twelve could be lawn care takers. Beckham executed this by having employers rate their employees and then giving the employees the Stanford Binet intelligence inventory. He found that employees who were rated ‚Äòexcellent‚Äô had, on average, a higher mental age. From this Beckham concluded that a more intelligent worker is a better worker. Additionally, he concluded that a mental age of eight is sufficient for jobs with ‚Äúconsiderable‚Äù amounts of responsibility and that people with a mental age of ten or greater were equipped to handle intelligent responsibility. The high value that this study places on the Stanford Binet intelligence inventory is very indicative of the attitudes of the era in which it was written. The publication of this work was very pertinent because employers were beginning to put more of an emphasis on selecting employees based on intelligence level. This study was published in the Personnel Journal and was used to train the mentally handicapped. Biological studies Beckham was interested in specific medical conditions in African American populations. ‚ÄúAlbinism in Negro children‚Äù (1946) and ‚ÄúNarcolepsy among Negros‚Äù explored these topics. Race-related studies Beckham studied race and the effects of racism. His 1929 study ‚ÄúIs the Negro happy?‚Äù was designed to measure the life satisfaction of African Americans despite racism, segregation, and discrimination. Beckham asked three questions: ‚ÄúIs the Negro happy?‚Äù, ‚ÄúAre you happy as a Negro?‚Äù, and ‚ÄúShould the Negro be happy?‚Äù. He worded the questions in exactly this manner with no disambiguation because he felt that, although there would be different interpretations of these questions, the answers given would reflect a general emotion and attitude. Beckham surveyed 3,443 African-American people who he grouped by occupation: college students, doctors, lawyers, unskilled laborers, preachers, housewives, teachers, and musicians. Overall the study showed that, while the majority of African Americans reported being happy, a majority also reported that African Americans are not and should not be happy. These answers were different within the occupational groups though; in many cases the majority of one group would answer in the opposite way of the majority of another group. Beckham took the overall responses as an indication that African Americans were in the habit of simulating happiness for themselves despite an awareness of their dismal situations, he called this the Negro complex. The conclusions Beckham draws from this study are interesting, however, it is important to recognize that the questions that he asked were not very clear. The way in which he framed these questions leaves them up to a great deal of interpretation. While this was a somewhat intentional, the fact that they are so open-ended means that any conclusions drawn from the answers are very loose. Additionally, in his final analysis, Beckham looks at the total numbers rather than looking proportionately at the occupational groups. This is one way to measure the data, but it would be more accurate to take the proportions into consideration because the groups are uneven in number. Using proportions would give a better indication of African Americans as a whole. While this study was flawed, the concept of examining the psychological impacts of oppression was new and valuable. Beckham did other such studies. ‚ÄúA study of race attitudes in Negro children of adolescent age‚Äù (1934) looked at racial attitudes in a number of different contexts. It looked at the way African American children regarded people of other races and also the way racial prejudice impacted the children. Within these questions, the study examined how these children‚Äôs attitudes differed based on where they lived and whether they had behavioral problems. Mentally disabled and delinquent children Beckham studied abnormality in children and adolescents. Both as a school psychologist and a psychologist at the Institute for Juvenile Research Beckham saw a lot of abnormality in his career.Graves, Scott (2009) Some of his research reflected this. \\"Juvenile crime\\" (1932), \\"Juvenile delinquency and the Negro\\" (1931), and \\"Over- suggestibility in juvenile delinquency\\" (1933) all demonstrated his interest in these issues. Some of Beckham‚Äôs studies on intelligence scores focused on the mentally disabled. One unpublished study entitled \\"A study of retarded children and their mothers\\" explored the relationships between the specific disabilities of children and the intelligence of their mothers Contributions Beckham was a pioneer in the field of Black psychology. He was among the first African Americans to earn a PhD in psychology and was involved in the founding and ground-level of unprecedented programs for African Americans. He taught university students at Wilberforce University and Howard University and provided guidance to thousands of students in the Chicago public school system.Guthrie (1998) His greatest research achievements fall under the headings of intelligence and behavioral disorders. In these fields Beckham provided alternative theories to mainstream psychology‚Äôs suggestions that African Americans were inherently deficient.

In 2009, Brian Michael Bendis, creator of the comic book, confirmed plans to develop a Powers television show on FX as well as his involvement as the writer of the pilot for the show. In February 2011, a greenlit pilot of the show scripted by Charles H. Eglee was announced as a co-production by Sony Pictures Television and FX Networks. Charles S. Dutton became the first cast member in May 2011 when he signed on to play Captain Cross. Imminent filming in Chicago within weeks was announced in June 2011. The following week, Lucy Punch was cast as Deena Pilgrim. Katee Sackhoff had campaigned for the part. Although FX was rumored to be courting Kyle Chandler for the part of Walker, the next day Jason Patric was cast in the part. Later in June, Carly Foulkes was cast as RetroGirl and Bailee Madison was cast as Calista. Filming began in Chicago in early July 2011 and ended in early August. In November 2011, FX announced that it would retool and reshoot the Powers pilot. Bendis tweeted that \\"the reshoots are planned for January and are all about tone and clarity\\". In April 2012, more scripts were ordered and writing continued, but reshoots and recasting were being discussed by the network. On March 19, 2014, it was announced that Powers would become the first original television series on the PlayStation Network, to stream exclusively on PlayStation consoles and potentially stream in December 2014. On July 16, 2014, Susan Heyward, Max Fowler and Adam Godley were cast as Deena Pilgrim, Krispin Stockley and Captain Cross.

Education  Staniford attended Chulmleigh Community College, North Devon, between 2006 and 2007 where he achieved 14 GCSEs. He then went on to study the International Baccalaureate programme at Exeter College. In June 2012 Staniford graduated from the University of Rennes 1 following completion of his Master 1 (mention Droit Europ√©en) degree.

After healing, Staniford continued to ride with Bikin Motion and became increasingly serious about his sport. He was scheduled to represent Great Britain in the 2009 Taipei Deaflympics but unfortunately a crash whilst out training resulted in a broken wrist and head injuries which meant he was unable to attend.

Missing out on the Deaflympics did not discourage Staniford, who soon began investigating para-cycling and managed to attend a second round of British Cycling(BC) para-cycling talent camps and was invited onto the BC Para-cycling Talent Team which develops talented riders and prepares them for transition into higher levels of competition representing Great Britain. Staniford was provisionally put in the C4 class by the UCI; a harsh decision influenced by the scarcity of knowledge about MDP syndrome and its effects, at that time (it wasn't even a recognised condition). As part of the BC Para Talent Team Staniford raced in the 2010 UCI Paracycling World Cup Series in Bilbao (Spain) and the 2010 URT 24 Handisport UCI Para-Cycling World Cup Series in Bayonne (France).

The large hashed area reflects Russia's current extended continental shelf claim The Arctic policy of Russia is the domestic and foreign policy of the Russian Federation with respect to the Russian region of the Arctic. The Russian region of the Arctic is defined in the \\"Russian Arctic Policy\\" as all Russian possessions located north of the Arctic Circle. (About one-fifth of Russia's landmass is north of the Arctic Circle.) Russia is one of five countries bordering the Arctic Ocean. In 2011, out of 4 million inhabitants of the Arctic, roughly 2 million lived in arctic Russia, making it the largest arctic country by population. However, in recent years Russia's Arctic population has been declining. The main goals of Russia in its Arctic policy are to utilize its natural resources, protect its ecosystems, use the seas as a transportation system in Russia's interests, and ensure that it remains a zone of peace and cooperation. Russia currently maintains a military presence in the Arctic and has plans to improve it, as well as strengthen the Border Guard/Coast Guard presence there. Using the Arctic for economic gain has been done by Russia for centuries for shipping and fishing. Russia has plans to exploit the large offshore resource deposits in the Arctic. The Northern Sea Route is of particular importance to Russia for transportation, and the Russian Security Council is considering projects for its development. The Security Council also stated a need for increasing investment in Arctic infrastructure. Russia conducts extensive research in the Arctic region, notably the drifting ice stations and the Arktika 2007 expedition, which was the first to reach the seabed at the North Pole. The research is partly aimed to back up Russia's territorial claims, specifically those related to Russia's extended continental shelf in the Arctic Ocean. History On October 1, 1987, Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, delivered the Murmansk Initiative stating six goals of the Soviet Union's Arctic foreign policy: establish a nuclear-free zone in Northern Europe; reduce military activity in the Baltic, Northern, Norwegian and Greenland Seas; cooperate on resource development; form an international conference on Arctic scientific research coordination; cooperate in environmental protection and management; and open the Northern Sea Route. Geography {alt=Map showing the Kara Sea. alt=Map showing the East Siberian Sea. |} The Russian Ministry of Economic Development has identified eight Arctic Support Zones on which funds and projects will be focused, with the aim of fostering the economic potential of the Northern Sea Route while ensuring that the Russian presence will not be limited to resource extraction. The eight zones are Kola, Arkhangelsk, Nenets, Vorkuta, Yamal-Nenets, Taimyr-Turukhan, North Yakutia and Chukotka. In the North Yakutia area, the project includes reconstruction of the Tiksi sea port and the port of Zelenomysky. In the Arkhangelsk zone, this will include the construction of the . Exploration The first recorded voyage to the Russian Arctic was by the Novgorodian Uleb in 1032, in which he discovered the Kara Sea. From the 11th to the 16th centuries, Russian coastal dwellers of the White Sea, or pomors, gradually explored other parts of the Arctic coastline, going as far as the Ob and Yenisey rivers, establishing trading posts in Mangazeya. Continuing the search of furs and walrus and mammoth ivory, the Siberian Cossacks under Mikhail Stadukhin reached the Kolyma River by 1644. Ivan Moskvitin discovered the Sea of Okhotsk in 1639 and Fedot Alekseyev Popov and Semyon Dezhnyov discovered the Bering Strait in 1648, with Dezhnyov establishing a permanent Russian settlement near the present day Anadyr. After Peter I took the throne, Russia began to develop a navy and use it to continue its Arctic exploration. Vitus Bering explored Kamchatka in 1728, while Bering's aides Ivan Fyodorov and Mikhail Gvozdev discovered Alaska in 1732. The Great Northern Expedition, which lasted from 1733 to 1743, was one of the largest exploration enterprises in history, organized and led by Vitus Bering, Aleksei Chirikov and a number of other major explorers. A party of the expedition personally led by Bering and Chirikov discovered southern Alaska, the Aleutian Islands and the Commander Islands, while the parties led by Stepan Malygin, Dmitry Ovtsyn, Fyodor Minin, Semyon Chelyuskin, Vasily Pronchischev, Khariton Laptev and Dmitry Laptev mapped most of the Arctic coastline of Russia (from the White Sea in Europe to the mouth of Kolyma River in Asia). The expedition resulted in 62 large maps and charts of the Arctic region. Territorial claims Modern Russian territorial claims to the Arctic officially date back to April 15, 1926, when the Soviet Union claimed land between 32¬∞04'35\\"E and 168¬∞49'30\\"W. However, this claim specifically only applied to islands and lands within this region. The first maritime boundary between Russia and Norway, from the Varangerfjord, was signed in 1957. However, tensions resurfaced after both countries made continental shelf claims in the 1960s. Informal talks began in the 1970s about determining a boundary in the Barents Sea to settle differing claims, as Russia wanted the boundary to be a line running straight north from the mainland, more than what it had. On September 15, 2010, Foreign Ministers Jonas Gahr St√∏re and Sergei Lavrov, of Norway and Russia respectively, signed a treaty that effectively divided the disputed territory in half between the two countries, and also agreed to co-manage resources in that region where they overlap national sectors. The two countries had already been co-managing fisheries in the Barents since the 1978 Grey Zone Agreement, which has been renewed annually since it was signed. MIR submersibles were used in the Arktika 2007 expedition to the North Pole. On March 12, 1997, Russia ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which allowed countries to make claims to extended continental shelves. In accordance with UNCLOS, Russia submitted a claim to an extended continental shelf beyond its 200-mile (320 km) exclusive economic zone on December 20, 2001, to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS). Russia claimed that two underwater mountain chains - the Lomonosov and Mendeleev ridges - within the Russian sector of the Arctic were extensions of the Eurasian continent and thus part of the Russian continental shelf. The UN CLCS neither validated nor invalidated the claim but requested Russia to submit additional data to substantiate its claim. Russia planned to submit additional data to the CLCS in 2012. In August 2007, a Russian expedition named Arktika 2007, led by Artur Chilingarov, planted a Russian flag on the seabed at the North Pole. This was done in the course of scientific research to substantiate Russia's 2001 extended continental shelf claim submission. Rock, mud, water, and plant samples at the seabed were collected and brought back to Russia for scientific study. The Natural Resources Ministry of Russia announced that the bottom samples collected from the expedition are similar to those found on continental shelves. Russia is using this to substantiate its claim that the Lomonosov Ridge in its sector is a continuation of the continental shelf that extends from Russia, and that Russia has a legitimate claim to that seabed. The United States and Canada dismissed the flag planting as purely symbolic and legally meaningless. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov agreed, telling reporters: \\"The aim of this expedition is not to stake Russia's claim but to show that our shelf reaches to the North Pole.\\" Russia plants flag on Arctic floor . CNN News. He also confirmed that Arctic territory issues \\"can be tackled solely on the basis of international law, the International Convention on the Law of the Sea and in the framework of the mechanisms that have in accordance with it been created for determining the borders of states which have a continental shelf.\\" In another interview Sergey Lavrov said: \\"I was amazed by my Canadian counterpart‚Äôs statement that we are planting flags around. We‚Äôre not throwing flags around. We just do what other discoverers did. The purpose of the expedition is not to stake whatever rights of Russia, but to prove that our shelf extends to the North Pole. By the way the flag on the Moon, it was the same\\". Foreign Ministers and other officials representing Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia, and the United States met in Ilulissat, Greenland in May 2008, at the Arctic Ocean Conference and announced the Ilulissat Declaration. Among other things the declaration stated that any demarcation issues in the Arctic should be resolved on a bilateral basis between contesting parties. An example of such bilateral agreement was achieved between Russia and Norway in 2010. Military Part of Russia's current Arctic policy includes maintaining a military presence in the region. In 2014,the Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command (Russia) was established. The Russian Northern Fleet, the largest of the four Russian Navy fleets, is headquartered in Severomorsk, in the Kola Gulf on the Barents Sea. The Northern Fleet encompasses two-thirds of Russia's total naval power, and has close to 80 operational ships. As of 2013, this included approximately 35 submarines, six missile cruisers, and the flagship Petr Velikiy (Peter the Great), a nuclear-powered guided missile cruiser. In 2012 the Russian Navy resumed naval patrols of the Northern Sea Route, marked by a 2,000 mile patrol of the Russian Arctic by ten ships led by an icebreaker and the Petr Velikiy. The Russian Military also reportedly announced in June 2008 that it would increase the operational radius of its Northern Fleet submarines. The first nuclear icebreaker, the Lenin, began operating in the Northern Sea Route in July 1960. A total of ten nuclear-powered civilian vessels, including nine icebreakers, have been built in Russia. Three of these have been decommissioned, including the Lenin. Besides its six nuclear icebreakers, Russia also has 19 diesel polar icebreakers. Its nuclear icebreaker fleet includes the 50 Let Pobedy (50 Years of Victory), the largest nuclear icebreaker in the world. There are currently plans to build six more icebreakers, as well as plans to build a $33 billion year-round Arctic port. On September 28, 2011, President Medvedev lifted the ban on the privatization of the nuclear icebreaker fleet with decree No. 1256. This repeal will allow Atomflot, the state company that owns the fleet, to be at least partially owned by private investors. The government is expected to retain a controlling share in the company. Russia says that it has military units specifically trained for Arctic combat. On October 4, 2010, Russian Navy commander Admiral Vladimir Vysotsky was quoted as saying: \\"We are observing the penetration of a host of states which . . . are advancing their interests very intensively, in every possible way, in particular China,\\" and that Russia would \\"not give up a single inch\\" in the Arctic. Russian Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov announced plans on July 16, 2011, for the creation of two brigades that would be stationed in the Arctic. Russia's Arctic policy statement, approved by President Medvedev on September 18, 2008, called for the establishment of improved military forces in the Arctic to \\"ensure military security\\" in that region, as well as the strengthening of existing border guards in the area. Research Russia has conducted research in the Arctic for decades. The country is the only one that uses drift stations- research facilities seasonally deployed on drift ice- and also has other research stations in its Arctic zone. The first drift station, North Pole-1, was established on May 21, 1937, by the Soviet Union. Russian research has focused on the Arctic seabed, marine life, meteorology, exploration, and natural resources, among other topics. Recent research has also been focusing on studying the Lomonosov Ridge to collect evidence that could strengthen Russian territorial claims to the seabed in that region within the Russian sector of the Arctic. The Akademik Fyodorov has been actively used with the new Akademik Tryoshnikov to conduct research in the Arctic. Drifting station North Pole-38 was established in October 2010. In July 2011 the icebreaker Rossiya and the research ship Akademik Fyodorov began conducting seismic studies north of Franz Josef Land to find evidence to back up Russia's territorial claims in the Arctic. The Akademik Fyodorov and the icebreaker Yamal went on a similar mission the year before. The Lena-2011 expedition, a joint Russian-German project headed by J√∂rn Thiede, left for the Laptev Sea and the Lena River in the summer of 2011. It was to study Siberian climate and climate change, as well as gather information about the Russian continental shelf. The head of the expedition, who is also the chairman of the European Arctic Commission, expressed confidence that Russia will gather the evidence needed to confirm its claim to additional parts of the Arctic shelf. Current research stations under construction include one on Samoylovsky Island, which should be completed by mid-2012 and will focus on researching shelf zone permafrost, and one on the Svalbard Islands, which will be finished in 2013 and will focus on geophysical, hydrological, and geological research. Over the summer of 2015, Russia built a large Federal Security Service (Russ. FSB) Border Guard base on Alexandra Land island of the Franz Joseph Land archipelago, expanding on an already established airbase called Nagurskoye, above the 80th parallel. The new complex is made of multiple inter-connected buildings and can house a company of 150 soldiers for up to 18 months without the need of re-supply. Economy Reduction in Arctic ice due to climate change may open up more economic opportunities in the Arctic. Russia's economic interests in the Arctic are based on two things - natural resources and maritime transport. The Northern Sea Route, in use for centuries and officially defined by Russian legislation, is an Arctic shipping lane that stretches from the Barents Sea to the Bering Strait through Arctic waters. Travel along Northern Sea Route takes only one-third the distance needed to go through the Suez Canal, without as high a risk of pirates. The route is currently open for up to eight weeks a year, and studies are predicting that climate change will lead to further reduction in Arctic ice, which can lead to greater use of the route. Even when \\"open\\" this route is not totally ice free and requires Russian icebreaker and navigational support to ensure safety of passage. Currently of goods are transported along the Northern Sea Route every year. Traffic through the Route is expected to increase tenfold by 2020, and six tankers have already gone through in 2010. The Russian government estimates that annual cargo traffic could reach 85 million metric tons, and shipping along the Route could account for a quarter of cargo between Europe and Asia by 2030. However, using the Northern Sea Route extensively will require vast expansion of Russia's current infrastructure in the Arctic, especially ports and naval vessels. In August 2011 Nikolai Patrushev, Secretary of Russia's Security Council, stated that the poor condition of infrastructure in the Arctic hinders development there, reducing the attractiveness of the region's resources for development. The infrastructure is worse in the eastern part of Russia, which also contains more resources. Recent economic sanctions imposed on Russia have additionally weakened the NSR's viability for foreign investors and in 2014 the overall number of voyages across the passage has fallen dramatically from 71 to 53. \\"Sanctions Dull Russia's Arctic Shipping Route \\" The Maritime Executive, 22 January 2015. Accessed: 23 January 2015. The Yamal Peninsula, home to Russia's biggest natural gas reserves, was connected to the rest of Russia by Gazprom through the creation of the Obskaya‚ÄìBovanenkovo Line, which opened in 2010. This was part of Gazprom's Yamal project to develop natural gas resources in the Yamal Peninsula. Russian Railways plans to connect Indiga, which is being considered as a prime location for the construction of a deepwater port, and Amderma, site of the Amderma Airport, to its railway system by 2030. Prime Minister Putin also announced that a year-round port would be constructed on the Yamal Peninsula. But so far, Russia‚Äôs concentration on production of oil and gas on the Yamal Peninsula met with huge challenges. Staun, J√∏rgen. ‚ÄúRussia‚Äôs Strategy in the Arctic. ‚Äù Institute for Strategy, The Royal Danish Defence College. Copenhagen. March 2015. Web. 11 May 2017. In attempting to extract gas and oil in the Arctic region, Gazprom encounter harsh climate and the long lines of communication. So Gazprom requires large investments with high risk and a long investment horizon and is dependent on the energy prices continuing to be high so that the extraction is profitable. International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that the majority of the Arctic fields are not profitable if the world market price of oil is below 120 dollars per barrel. At the time of this writing (May 11, 2017), the price of Brent oil has fallen to around 50 dollars per barrel. Meanwhile, since Russian law only allows for the state energy companies Gazprom (mainly gas) and Rosneft (mainly oil) to extract oil and gas from the continental shelf ‚Äì but since these two firms do not have at their own disposal the necessary technological expertise ‚Äì they have entered into partnerships with a number of foreign firms. The Russian Government is also attempting to increase foreign investment in its Arctic resources. In August 2011 Rosneft, a Russian government-operated oil company, signed a deal with ExxonMobil in which Rosneft received some of Exxon's global oil assets in exchange for the joint development of Russian Arctic resources by both companies. This agreement includes a $3.2 billion hydrocarbon exploration of the Kara and Black seas (although the Black Sea is not in the Arctic), as well as the joint development of ice-resistant drilling platforms and other Arctic technologies. This deal followed a failed attempt at a similar cooperation between Rosneft and BP in May. Chevron is currently in talks with Rosneft about jointly developing Arctic resources. Russia is the only country in the world planning to use floating nuclear power plants. The Akademik Lomonosov, expected to go into operation in 2012, will be one of eight plants that will provide power to Russian coastal cities. There are plans for these plants to also provide power to large gas rigs in the Arctic Ocean in the future. The Prirazlomnoye field, an offshore oilfield in the Pechora Sea that will include up to 40 wells, is currently under construction and drilling is expected to start in early 2012. It will be the world's first ice-resistant oil platform and will also be the first offshore Arctic platform. Russia wants to establish its Arctic possessions as a major resource base by 2020. As climate change makes the Arctic areas more accessible, Russia, along with other countries, is looking to use the Arctic to increase its energy resource production. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, there are of oil and of natural gas north of the Arctic Circle. Overall, about 10% of the world's petroleum resources are estimated to be in the Arctic. The dominant portion of offshore Arctic hydrocarbon (oil and gas), as reflected in the USGS studies, is located within the current uncontested Exclusive Economic Zones of the five nations bordering the Arctic. In September 2013, Gazprom's oil drilling activities in the Arctic have drawn protests from environmental groups particularly Greenpeace. Greenpeace has opposed oil drilling in the Arctic on the grounds that oil drilling would cause damage to the Arctic ecosystem and that there are no safety plans in place to prevent oil spills. On September 18, the Greenpeace vessel MV Arctic Sunrise staged a protest and attempted to board Gazprom's Prirazlomnaya platform. In response, the Russian Coast Guard seized control of the ship, and arrested the activists. Phil Radford, executive director of Greenpeace USA, stated that the arrest of the Arctic 30 is the stiffest response that Greenpeace has encountered from a government since the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior in 1985 by the \\"action\\" branch of the French foreign intelligence services, the Direction g√©n√©rale de la s√©curit√© ext√©rieure (DGSE). Earlier in August 2012, Greenpeace had also staged similar protests against the same oil rig. The Russian government has intended to charge the Greenpeace activists with piracy, which carries a maximum penalty of fifteen years of imprisonment. Thirty members of the crew of \\"Arctic Sunrise\\" have been detained for 48 hours by authorities in Murmansk. The crew members come from 19 countries. Several members were arrested after having assaulted the Prirazlomnaya drill rig in the Pechora Sea.Interfax-AVN Moscow Online (English) 0825 GMT 25 September 2013 See also *Arctic Cooperation and Politics *Arctic Council *Extreme North (Russia) *Continental shelf of Russia *Chief Directorate of the Northern Sea Route *Greenpeace Arctic Sunrise ship case References  External links  * Russian Federation Policy for the Arctic to 2020  Literature  * Lagutina M.

Born in Ettrick, Virginia to Charles James and Carrie Daniel, he was the sixth of eight children.  Personal life  In September 1929, Daniel married Blanche Ardell Taylor of Richmond. Taylor died before her husband, and in December 1966, Daniel remarried to North Carolina socialite Marie Plummer Orsot. Academic career Robert P. Daniel graduated magna cum laude from Virginia Union University with a Bachelor of Arts in 1924. He was valedictorian and his class secretary. Upon graduation, he worked as an instructor of mathematics and freshman English for two years, and in 1926 he worked as an assistant professor of education. Daniel attended Columbia University for his graduate schooling, receiving a master's degree in education in 1928 and a Ph.D. in educational psychology in 1932. Concurrently and until 1936, he worked as a professor of education and psychology and Director of the Extension Division at Virginia Union University.Guthrie, R. V., & Grier, W. H. (2003). Even the Rat Was White: A Historical View of Psychology (2nd ed.). Boston, MA: Allyn and Bacon. p. 173 Between 1932 and 1936, Daniel worked at Virginia Union University as Director of the Division of Educational Psychology and Philosophy. During the summers of 1935 and 1936, Daniel worked as a visiting professor of education at Hampton Institute in Virginia. In 1936, at 33 years old, Daniel became President of Shaw University in North Carolina. In 1950, the Virginia State Board of Education elected Daniel as president of Virginia State College, where he worked until his death in 1968. Notable scholarship Robert P. Daniel made significant contributions to educational psychology and Black psychology throughout his career. His premier scholarship \\"A Psychological Study of Delinquent Negro Boys\\" was published in 1932 in The Journal of Negro Education. The first contribution in its field, Daniel's discusses perceived differences in character and personality traits of \\"behavior-problem\\" and \\"non-problem\\" Black boys. He administered seven tests which measured mental ability, neurotic instability, personality, personal aptitudes, moral knowledge, and trustworthiness. By comparing the results of the aforementioned tests between the problems and non-problem boys, he concludes that the two groups exhibited differences in the things they do and the degree they feel. Daniel's aimed for his work to be a foundation in the field of Black youth delinquency and personality traits. Daniel coauthored the article \\"The Curriculum of the Negro College,\\" with his brother Walter G. Daniel. They review Black education and discuss an inconsistency apparent in Black schools: as a group, they are ten to thirty years behind American educational norms, but their courses are almost identical to those offered at White colleges. Daniel and Daniel argue that the college accreditation process prevents Black higher education from experimenting with different methods and course structure for Black students. Daniel and Daniel fault America's racial caste system for hindering Black students' success and argue for the need for differentiation from White educational norms in Black college education. They suggest increased financial support, institutional resources and professional leadership in Black colleges to achieve the highest quality of work, learning, and scholarship. In 1960, as President of Virginia State College, Daniel published \\"Relationship of the Negro Public College and the Negro Private and Church- Related College,\\" which describes the status of Black higher education . Private and college-related colleges, first established by White missionaries during Reconstruction, preceded publicly funded Black institutions. Publicly funded colleges, while having a slower establishment, became the choice higher education option for the majority of Blacks by the mid-1940s. In examining this change, Daniel explains that lower cost, more extensive curricula, and better faculties and facilities than specialized private- or church-related colleges explain the rise in enrollment at publicly funded Black colleges. Daniel concludes that despite the different routes Black youth take in attaining higher education, their success in life is dependent on an individual's ability to make their lives \\"count for good.\\" He charges Black institutions with being adept at handling a nation and world that is constantly changing and work to excel in all academic fields.

He succeeded his uncle Pedro, whose episcopate, and life, had ended in exile after the Battle of Candespina (1111).Diego's relationship with Pedro is established by a royal charter dated 27 March 1122, cf. Fletcher, 69 n. 174. After a brief usurpation by Archbishop Maurice of Braga, Diego was elected to replace Pedro.For the usurpation of Le√≥n by the bishop of Braga, cf. P.

Diego spent much of his episcopate repairing his diocese from the damage wrought by the civil war between the supporters of Queen Urraca and Alfonso the Battler. There is evidence from 1120 and from a royal charter of 4 November 1123 of Diego \\"exploiting new sources of revenue, restoring the property of the chapter and the ecclesiastical routine of the cathedral, settling a dispute with his chapter.\\" He continued his uncle's struggle for independence from the archdiocese of Toledo, at which he was not initially successful. In 1121 Pope Calixtus II declared Le√≥n a suffragan of Toledo. In 1125 Honorius II confirmed it, but by 1130 Diego had succeeded in getting this decision reversed and regained his prior exemption.Fletcher, 69 n. 177: \\"All direct evidence of this is lost, but it may be inferred from [Pope] Innocent II's reactions in 1130.\\" He did not have it for long. He was deposed by a synod held in Carri√≥n de los Condes in 1130, probably at the instigation of his Toledan opponents. His successor, Arias, was illegally consecrated by the archbishop of Toledo.

It has since been released on several Simon & Garfunkel compilation albums. It has also been recorded by the London Pops Orchestra and Joe Chindamo trio. Art Garfunkel has stated that the origin of the song came from his request that Paul Simon write a song about the famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright while Simon has stated that he wrote the song, despite not knowing who Wright was. Garfunkel sings lead on the majority of the song while Simon sings on the bridge. Background The lyrics of \\"So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright\\" have multiple meanings: on one level, the song praises the famous architect, who died in 1959. However, the lyrics also refer to the upcoming breakup of the Simon and Garfunkel duo. Art Garfunkel had studied to become an architect, so on this level the lyrics can be taken as a farewell from Paul Simon to his friend and partner Garfunkel like another song on Bridge over Troubled Water, \\"The Only Living Boy in New York.\\" While Garfunkel sings the song's fadeout to the words \\"so long,\\" producer and engineer Roy Halee is heard on the recording calling out \\"So long already Artie!\\" Other lyrics of the song refer to the creative process, such as referring to the singer not having learned the tune and to the nights when the singer and Frank Lloyd Wright would \\"harmonize 'til dawn.\\" The lyrics also refer to the singer thinking of Wright when looking for inspiration. The accompaniment includes congas, strings, a flute uncredited on the liner notes, bass and a classical guitar part played in bossa nova style, primarily using seventh chords. The song has a stately melody and the tune incorporates varied rhythms and syncopations. The song's key alternates between G-flat major and G major. Simon has recalled that he had been listening to Brazilian music, probably Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim, when he wrote the tune for \\"So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright.\\" Author Walter Everett suggests that the repeating note section of the bridge about one minute into the song effectively suggests the ordinariness of other architects, and also suggests some of Wright's architectural signatures. Garfunkel did not realise that Simon had intended the song to refer to their partnership until many years after the album had been released. In an interview he remarked that Simon \\"never let me in on that\\" secret. He added that \\"I find that a secretive and unpleasant thing to have done to you.\\" However, he has come to terms with the song, as he states in the liner notes to his 2012 compilation The Singer, in which \\"So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright\\" was included, that he can ignore this subtext, since the song is \\"just so much fun to sing\\", and writes about Paul Simon that \\"one loves the giver of a beautiful gift\\".

York Rodeo  The annual York Rodeo is held at Ormand Kinning Memorial Park on the second weekend of August. First held in 1963, it was the idea of York resident Ormond Kinning. Beer and food were originally sold there from tents. When a tornado destroyed the Kinnings's barn, the first food stand was built with lumber salvaged from the barn. This was used until 1972, when committee members decided to replace it with a new one, which was later reinforced with steel sides and used as a shelter. Rodeo weekend includes many activities. On Saturday, a coed softball tournament begins, with its championship game held Sunday. On Saturday afternoon, there is an antique tractor ride from the schoolhouse to the park, followed by the Gymkhana, then a lip-sync singing contest. Saturday evening finishes with a dance, with music provided by a local band. Sunday begins with a grand parade in the morning, from the schoolhouse to the park. It is followed by games for kids and adults, including bingo and a dunk tank. The rodeo then begins, with sheep and steer riding, egg tosses, sack races, chicken- and pig-catching, and a coin find. There is also a horseshoe tournament open to everyone. The weekend concludes with a raffle for $1,000 and fireworks. The York Bar The York Bar was built in the early 1900s by Theodore Larson. It was originally the York Grocery Store, which owners Tom and Bernice Larson bought from Emil Neprud in November, 1935. The Larsons obtained their first beer license in July, 1936. A kitchen, added to the building's south side in 1943, sold donuts, cakes and lunches to workers and town visitors. Until the 1950s, patrons used an outhouse behind the building. Indoor bathrooms and bar room were added in the 1950s. The York Grocery Store tried to provide a little bit of everything, including work gloves, women‚Äôs stockings, school supplies, notions, cigarettes and snuff, fresh eggs, a meat counter, groceries, and ice cream. In the 1960s, larger grocery stores opened in the area, drawing shoppers away from York. This motivated the Larsons to obtain a liquor license in 1967, which increased their business significantly. The store was open from 7:00 AM to midnight Monday through Saturday, and from 7:00 AM to 1:00 PM on Sundays. In July, 1973, the store was sold to Rodney and Joanne Steig. They operated it for several years before selling it to Roger and Sharon Severson, who in turn sold it to Michael Rogstad and Ronnie Moe. The Moes then sold the store to Lawrence Bloom, who sold it to its current owner, Jamie Pfaff, in 2003.Faldet, Dianne. ‚ÄúHistory of the York Bar.‚Äù Northfield Township Celebrates Its Heritage 1857‚Äì2007. 2007. 61‚Äì62.

Qahtaba was a Khurasani Arab, belonging to the Tayy tribe. He had journeyed to Mecca, where the imam of the Hashimiyya Ibrahim ibn Muhammad appointed him as the military leader for the upcoming anti-Umayyad uprising in Khorasan. This appointment was accepted by the main Abbasid leader, Abu Muslim, and following the fall of Merv to the Abbasids and their supporters in February 748, Qahtaba was placed in command of the Abbasid forces that pursued the last Umayyad governor of Khurasan, Nasr ibn Sayyar. His army took Nishapur, where Nasr had sought refuge, defeated a 10,000-strong Umayyad force at Gurgan in August and subsequently took Rayy. There he wintered, and in March 749 he defeated a larger Umayyad army under Amir ibn Djubara, allegedly 50,000 strong, near Isfahan. Nihavand fell after a short siege and the Abbasid army began moving towards Iraq. Qahtaba's army advanced swiftly with the aim of taking Kufa, but was confronted by the Umayyad governor, Yazid ibn Hubayra. Qahtaba was able to launch a surprise night attack on the Umayyad camp, forcing Yazid and his troops to flee to Wasit. Qahtaba himself fell in this battle, but his son al-Hasan ibn Qahtaba assumed command and took possession of Kufa on 2 September. Both al-Hasan and his brother, Humayd ibn Qahtaba, were important military leaders in the early decades of the Abbasid regime.

It is significant to the Hindu sect of Saivism as one of the temples associated with the nine planet elements, the Navagraha Stalas, and specifically Rahu. Shiva is worshiped as Naganathar, and is represented by the lingam. His consort Parvati is depicted as Piraisoodi Amman. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. It houses four gateway towers known as gopurams. The temple has numerous shrines, with those of Naganathar, Rahu and Piraisoodi Amman being the most prominent. The temple complex houses many halls; the most notable is the ornamental entrance hall built during the Nayak period. The temple has six daily rituals at various times from 5:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., and twelve yearly festivals on its calendar.  Legend  One of the shrines in the temple around the second precinct Thirunageswaram is one of the many temple towns in the state which is named after the grooves, clusters or forests dominated by a particular variety of a tree or shrub and the same variety of tree or shrub sheltering the presiding deity. The region is believed to have been covered with Chamapaka forest and hence called Chamapakavanam. Many serpents, including Adishesha, Takshaka and Karkotaka, worshipped Shiva at this place, leading to the name \\"Tirunageswaram\\". As per Hindu legend, the king of snakes, Adisesha did penance at this place, called Senbaranya Kshetram on account of the presence of large number of Senbaga trees. Shiva was pleased by the penance and appeared to him. Since Shiva gave a boon to the king of Serpents, he is called Naganathar. A Goddess Girigujambal is believed to be worshipping Shiva here with goddesses Lakshmi, Saraswathi, Ganesha, Muruga, and Shasta. Maha Bhairava is still believed to be guarding and assisting the divine mother during her prayers. The Goddess is said to be Swayambu as she is present in the form of Meru. Hence, no abhishekam (ablution) is performed for the image. As per a Hindu legend, Indra was cursed by sage Gautama as he misbehaved with the latter's wife Ahalya. To obtain deliverance from the sage's curse, it is said that Indra worshipped Giri-Gujambigai with a scented material termed Punugu for 45 days. Sages like Gautama and Parashara and kings like Bhagiratha and Nala are said to have worshipped Naganathar at this place. The name \\"Kumbakonam\\", roughly translated in English as the \\"Jug's Corner\\", is believed to be an allusion to the mythical pot (kumbha) of the Hindu god Brahma that contained the seed of all living beings on earth. The kumbha is believed to have been displaced by a pralaya (dissolution of the universe) and ultimately came to rest at the spot where the town of Kumbakonam now stands. The drops of nectar are believed to have fallen onto five shrines around Kumbakonam, namely Mahlingeswarar temple at Tiruvidaimarudur, Tirudharasuram, Naganathar Temple at Tirunageswaram, Tiruvorgam and Tirupadalavanam. Architecture Representation of the three Devis as in the sanctum of Piraisoodi Ambal The temple is another masterpiece which exhibits the Chola style of architecture. It is believed to have been built by Aditya Chola I in the 10th century A.D. Later rulers have modified the temple with their own additions. The temple has a separate shrine for Rahu. The temple is located on the southern bank of the river Kaveri 7 km from Kumbakonam. The temple campus encompasses exclusive shrines for Naganatha Swamy (Shiva), Pirayani Amman (Parvathi), Giri-Gujambigai (Parvathi) and Rahu with his divine spouses. Goddess Girigujambal has a separate shrine inside the temple campus as it is believed that the goddess is in thava kolam (mode of deep penance). The temple covers an area of South-North and East-West with concentric sub lanes and four major streets around the four sides. There are four gateways along the four sides with entry towers (gopuram) and a surrounding compound wall. In the broad pathway on the third precinct, there is a flower garden on the northern side. The Vinayaka shrine, Bali Peetam, Nandikeshwara hall and flag post are located in the eastern entrance.This Ganapathy shrine is said to have been installed by the great saint Sadasiva Brahmendra along with a Ganapathy yantra. An inscription in the temple bears testimony to this fact. The temple tank is called Sula Theertham, a dip in which, is believed to clear sins committed by human beings. The temple tank is located in the southern side and has a hundred pillared hall. The second precinct has a granite floor and enshrines the Rahu shrine in the north eastern corner. The path leading to the main shrine in the second precinct has a hall decorated with Nayak style pillars with yalis. The hall was constructed by Govinda Dikshitar, the minister of successive Nayak rulers, Achuthappa Nayak (1560‚Äì1614) and Raghunatha Nayak (1600‚Äì34). In the front hall on the eastern side, artistic pillar with \\"older and nine horses\\" design is found, while similar pillars are found on the southern side as well. There is a hall in the northern side with pillars decorated with yalis used for staging idols during the festive occasions. The renovation work in the western walls was done during 1929 with artistic inscriptions. In the path way to main shrine, there are art works depicting Veda nayakas, king Sambumali and penance pose of Ambal. The Dwarapalaga images on each side at the entrance of Naganathar shrine are made of chunam clay. View of the temple Worship and religious practises Image of the temple entrance The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. Like other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Shaivaite community, a Brahmin sub- caste. The temple rituals are performed six times a day; Ushathkalam at 6:00 a.m., Kalasanthi at 9:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 1:00 p.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m., Irandamkalam at 7:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 9:00 p.m. There is a separate calendar for the Rahu Abhishekam (sacred ablution): it is performed twice in a day at 11:30 a.m and 5:30 p.m. and additionally twice at various times in the day. Each ritual comprises four steps: abhisheka (sacred bath), alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Annamalaiyar and Unnamulai Amman. The worship is held amidst music with nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument), religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) read by priests and prostration by worshippers in front of the temple mast. There are weekly rituals like ' and ', fortnightly rituals like pradosham and monthly festivals like amavasai (new moon day), kiruthigai, pournami (full moon day) and sathurthi. The Brahmotsvam or prime festival is celebrated for ten days in the Tamil month of Karthigai (November‚ÄìDecember). There is a procession in silver vehicle, marriage festival of the presiding deity, another procession around the streets of Tirunageswarm in temple chariot, sanctification in temple tank and concludes with Vidayathri (farewell function) when a flower palanquin takes the images of the temple deities around the temple. The festival is celebrated amidst music with nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument) and religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) and Tevaram read by priests. Kandasashti festival is celebrated for six during October or November every year when Murugan, the son of Shiva, symbolically kills the demon Surapadma. The scene is enacted in the South street of the temple during the festival. As per local legend, Rahu got relieved of his pains praying to Naganathar during a Shivaratri day and the day is celebrated in the temple. Navarathri festival is celebrated for nine days for Girigujambigai and the images of Naganathar and Girigujambigai is taken in horse chariot on Vijayadasami, the concluding day of the festival. Sekkizhar Vaikasi Pooja is celebrated from 1969 on the birth date of Sekkizhar, the author of Periya Puranam, the epic describing the life history of the 63 nayanars. Rahu Peyarchi is a festival celebrated once every 1.5 years on the star when Rahu switches its planetary position from one raasi (galaxy) to the other. Religious significance The temple tank The ablution of the image of Rahu during Rahukaalam with milk turning to blue colour in this temple is considered to be a miracle and attracts devotees from distant places. As per Hindu belief, people troubled by Sarpa-dosha or Malefic effects Rahu-Kethu seek a relief by offering prayers in a single day to Kudanthai or Kumbakonam Nageshwarar in the morning, Thirunageshwaram Naganathar at the noon, Thirupamburam Pambureswarar in the evening and Nagoor Nageshwarar or Naganathar temple at night. Tirugnana Sambandar, a 7th-century Tamil Saivite poet, venerated Naganathar in ten verses in Tevaram, compiled as the First Tirumurai. Appar, a contemporary of Sambandar, also venerated Annamalaiyar in 10 verses in Tevaram, compiled as the Fifth Tirumurai. As the temple is revered in Tevaram, it is classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, one of the 275 temples that find mention in the Saiva canon. The temple is one of the most visited temples in the district.

She spent her time in British service on the North American station based in Halifax, Nova Scotia. During the War of 1812, Colibri served mostly in blockading the American coast and capturing privateers and merchant ships. She foundered in 1813 in Port Royal Sound, South Carolina, but without loss of life. French service Between 1 October and 14 December 1808, Colibri was under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Deslandes, who sailed her from Havre to Cherbourg. In December or January he then left Cherbourg for San Domingo.Fonds, Vol. 1, pp. 379 & 404. Capture On 16 January 1809 Melampus, under Captain Edward Hawker, captured Colibri off Barbuda, after her captain had the \\"temerity\\" to put up a fight as Melampus was sailing alongside. Colibri was armed with fourteen 24-pounder carronades and two 8-pounder guns, and had a crew of 92 men. In the engagement, Colibri had three men killed and 11 wounded before she struck. She was sailing from Cherbourg with a cargo of 570 barrels of flour and a great quantity of gunpowder intended for the relief of San Domingo. On her way she had captured and sunk two British brigs that had been sailing from Newfoundland to Lisbon, the Hannibal and the Priscilla, both of Dartmouth. The Royal Navy took Colibri into service under her existing name. British service The British commissioned Colibri in October under Lieutenant Henry Jane. He received his promotion to Commander, a rank more in keeping with the size of his vessel, on 10 May 1810. In October 1809, Commander John Thomson replaced Jane. He remained in command until her loss in August 1813 apart from a short period between December 1812 and February 1813 when he acted as Port Captain in Halifax and George Brooke-Pechell held acting command.Dictionary of National Biography, Pechell, Sir George Richard Brooke Colibri was in company with on 9 October 1810 when she captured Fortuna. On 15 March 1811, Colibri captured the American slaver Carolina (alias Atrevido) off Amelia Island with some 200 slaves. Atrevido, Ponce de Leon, master, was sailing from Loanga to Amelia Island; Colibri sent her into Nassau.Lloyd's List, 28 May 1811, - accessed 22 November 2013. Later, the Vice Admiralty Court in Bermuda appears to have decided that the vessel‚Äôs putative Spanish nationality was fraudulent and that she was, in fact, American. The number of slaves freed at Nassau turned out to be 204. On 25 March 1811, captured the Spanish vessel Empressa. Colibri was either accompanying Little Belt or in sight of the capture and so shared in the prize money. On 28 June 1812 Colibri was despatched from Halifax under a flag of truce to New York, carrying news that the Orders in Council had been repealed. On 9 July she anchored off Sandy-Hook, and three days later sailed on her return with a copy of the declaration of war, the British ambassador, Mr. Foster, and consul, Colonel Barclay. She then arrived in Halifax eight days later. On 19 July Colibrie recaptured Fanny, Colleton, master, which had been sailing from Port Glasgow to St Johns when originally captured. Her cargo was valued at ¬£7,800. On 23 July Colibri captured the U.S. privateer sloop Gleaner, of Kennebunk, Maine, off Cape Sable. Gleaner was armed with six guns and had a crew of 40 men under the command of Captain N. Lord. She was on her first cruise. On 24 July 1812, Colibri sighted three vessels off Cape Sable and gave chase to one, a schooner. When Colibri got close she exchanged signals with the schooner, which turned to be . Colibri then chased and took two other vessels, which turned out to be an American privateer and a bark, her prize. The privateer was the Catherine; eight days out of Boston; she had taken only the bark. Catherine, under the command of Francis A. Burnham, was pierced for 16 guns but mounted fourteen 6-pounder guns and had a crew of 88 men. She had suffered one man killed and one wounded before she surrendered after a 15-minute action. Her casualties were low as the crew had taken refuge below decks. In contrast to Thomson‚Äôs official report, one American newspaper reported that the action had lasted one and a half hours and that Colibri had six men killed and several wounded.Niles register, Vol 2, pp.415. On 2 August 1812 Colibri met up with and reported that an American privateer was said to be sheltering nearby. The two set out together and as they approached the coast Emulous suddenly grounded. During the efforts to get her off, Colibri took off all non-essential crew and the prisoners she had on board. Shortly thereafter Emulous fell over onto her beam-ends and became unsalvageable. Her position was some 19 miles from Cape Sable Island, Nova Scotia. This incident coincidentally foreshadowed Colibris own fate the following year. On 11 August 1812 Colibri captured the American privateer schooner Polly in the Bay of Fundy. Polly was armed with four guns and had a crew of with 35 men. That same day, Colibri was in company with for the capture of the American privateer Buckskin. The next day Colibri captured two more small American privateers, both off Cape Sable. One was the schooner Regulator. She was armed with just one gun and had a crew of 40 men. The second was the Dolphin, for which Colibri shared the capture with . Dolphin had two guns and a crew of 48 men. On 13 August Colibri shared with Maidstone, and in the capture of the American vessel John. Ten days later, Colibri captured the ship Monk, of 253 tons. She was sailing from Rio de Janeiro to Salem with a cargo of sugar, hides, and horns. San Domingo, Dragon, Statira and Colibri shared the capture of three vessels at the beginning of 1813. These were the American schooners Scyron (16 January) and American Eagle (18 January), and the Swedish brig Hanosand (13 February). On 10 February Statira shared with five other warships in the capture of the St. Michael. However, Statira had to divide up her portion because she was in a prize-money sharing agreement with Colibri, , and . Then Colibri captured 10 small merchantmen, most of them American. *Brig Commerce, of 120 tons and 11 men, carrying lumber, from Rhode Island to Havana, captured on 14 March and burnt. *Schooner Female, of 95 tons and six men, carrying flour, butter, and lard, from Baltimore to La Guira, captured 27 March and sent to Bermuda. *Swedish schooner Minerva, of 130 tons and 13 men, carrying molasses and sugar from Charleston to St. Bartholomew, captured on 29 March and sent to Providence. *Schooner Portsmouth, carrying lumber, from Cuba to Rhode Island, captured on 16 April and sent to Providence. *Schooner Eliza, of 95 tons, carrying sundries from Wilmington to Savannah,' captured 1 May and sent to Bermuda. *Schooner Nancy carrying sundries from Georgetown to Savannah, captured 1 May, burnt after the transfer of her cargo to the Eliza. *Schooner Sampit, carrying sundries from Georgetown to Savannah, captured 1 May and burnt after the transfer of her cargo to the Eliza. *Schooner Wingaw, carrying sundries from Georgtown to Savannah, captured 1 May, burnt after the transfer of her cargo to the Eliza. *Spanish ship El de Padato in Cortes, of 160 tons and 14 men, carrying molasses, sugar, etc. from New York to Matanza‚Äôs, captured 27 May and sent to Providence. *Swedish schooner Gustava, of 140 tons and 8 men, carrying flour, meal, &c.; from Carthagena to Savannah, captured 17 June and sent to Providence. Colibri shared with in the capture of the American vessel Minerva on 2 April. Fate In August 1813, Colibri and were blockading the U.S. coast between Charleston and Georgetown. There was little shipping so the pair conducted a number of boat raids along the coast. They then decided to sail south of Charleston and on August they entered Port Royal Sound, South Carolina (not Port Royal, Jamaica as stated in some sources),. They anchored, but resistance by the local militia, which had erected shore batteries, forestalled any raids. Colibri and Moselle then decided to return to sea on August 23. However, the weather was poor and Colibri grounded on a sandbar as she led Moselle out. Attempts to lighten her and get her off were unsuccessful and as the tide went out she fell over to larboard. Her crew cut away her masts, but she was stuck fast. Moselle then rescued Colibris crew, who abandoned the wreck. A hurricane on 27 August 1813 destroyed Colibri and her boats. Moselle was able to find a passage and navigate across the bar to the open sea on 29 August. Thomson and his officers and crew were subsequently acquitted of any wrongdoing at the court martial into the loss of Colibri.

Lautenberg Letter On July 21, 2011, it was reported that representatives of the United States Department of Justice and the FBI had begun investigation into the Floorgraphics allegations.Michael Isikoff, US looks into alleged hacking by News Corp.'s ad arm, NBC News, July 21, 2011 * In 2010, the News Corporation paid $500 million to settle a case brought against it by Valassis Communications, after that company had won a $300 million verdict in state court in Michigan. The lawsuit by Valassis was based on claims that News America had gained market share by forcing its packaged- goods customers to sign long-term insert contracts or risk huge price increases on their in-store advertising displays The settlement included News America entering into a 10-year shared mail distribution agreement with Valassis Direct Mail, a Valassis subsidiary. * At the beginning of 2011, in a case in Minnesota brought by Insignia Systems, News America faced more than $600 million in fines. The News Corporation paid out $125 million to settle the allegations of anticompetitive behavior and violations of antitrust laws. This was the third time that the two companies had been involved in lawsuits. In August 2000, Insignia was sued by News America regarding exclusive promotional agreements with several major supermarket retailers, a suit that was settled confidentially in November 2002. In November 2003 Insignia was sued again, regarding Insignia's right to market in-store advertising and promotional services. In late 2011, the District Court of Atlanta granted a permanent injunction prohibiting Robert Emmel, a former News America Marketing executive, from sharing News America Marketing's confidential information and found that Emmel was not a whistleblower and was therefore not entitled to whistleblower protection under the Dodd-Frank Act, as he had claimed. In the court's ruling, it stated that far from harassing, or acting in a retaliatory manner towards him, News America Marketing ‚Äúactually assisted Emmel in obtaining new employment after it terminated him.‚Äù  References   External links  *News America Marketing official website *SmartSource official website *SmartSource.ca official website *Profile at Bloomberg Businessweek Category:Mass media companies of the United States Category:Companies based in New York City Category:News Corporation subsidiaries ","title":"News America Marketing"},{"id":"32459393","text":"This is a list of festivals in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

The roots of the 187th Fighter Wing date back to 1952 when the Alabama Air National Guard organized the 160th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron in Birmingham, Alabama equipped with the RF-51 Mustang. The squadron moved to Dannelly Field on January 1, 1953, and entered the jet age with the arrival of the RF-80 Shooting Star in 1955. Within a year the 160th transitioned to the RF-84 Thunderflash aircraft, which served as the squadron's primary aircraft for the next 15 years. The squadron was mobilized during the Berlin Crisis in 1961-1962 and deployed to Toul- Rosieres Air Base, France. In August 1962, the squadron returned to normal peacetime status and was reorganized. It was then officially designated the 187th Reconnaissance Group. In 1971, the Thunderflash was replaced by the RF-4C Phantom II, which was flown for 17 years. From 1971-1982, the group remained in the reconnaissance role. The 187th won many honors during this timeframe, including the best reconnaissance unit in the nation in the Photo Finish \\"81\\" competition. In 1982, the 187th changed missions from reconnaissance to the multi-purpose fighter role after acquiring the F-4D. The Group established itself as a premier tactical fighter unit by capturing overall top honors in the ANG Fangsmoke competition in 1987. In October 1988, the Group converted to the F-16 aircraft. In October 1995, the Group was designated a Wing under Air Force reorganization; becoming the 187th Fighter Wing.

It operates a bus rapid transit system in Lahore. However, the BRTs do not have dedicated lanes and right of privilege.  History  LTC was established under the Companies Ordinance of 1984, with intention of merging several transport companies operating in Lahore together under one company. In December 2001 LTC successfully merged the various transport companies of Lahore, with the aim to develop high quality, safe, efficient, environment friendly and affordable urban transport to Lahore city residents.http://www.ltc.gop.pk/plans.php Since December 2009, LTC has taken over the infrastructure and regulation responsibilities from the DRTA. LTC identified various inefficiencies in the existing routes and their alignments as they existed. Re-alignment for better management and efficiency has required an extensive survey transport study of Lahore. International consultants GTZ were selected by the Government of Punjab and completed its study in 2011.  Services  LTC has planned over 53 routes for the city of Lahore, of which 30 are now operational. Lahore Transport Company has a fleet of over 650 TransLahore buses which run throughout the city. The remaining non-operational routes are being serviced by unlicensed wagons, rickshaws and qingqi's. LTC intends to reclaim all routes through affordable and efficient bus transport services. At the moment, bus transport service in Lahore is being provided by a fleet of 650 buses, almost all of which are 6 year or older in manufacturing terms. Although LTC will be replacing the entire lot of old buses with new buses, yet LTC is aware that the induction of more than 2000 buses will take some time to replace the existing Buses. In order to provide comfortable service during this intermediary switching time, LTC has planned to refurbish the existing Buses and to increase their number of each route according to a careful planned study carried out by the LTC Operations and Planning wing. LTC also issues students \\"Green Cards\\" for affordable travel.http://ltc.gop.pk/greencard/  Cards and Android Phone Application  TransLahore issues Green Card for students and Free Bus Card for elderly persons.

Bogorodica or Church of the Assumption of the Holy Mother of God) is located in Piva, Montenegro near the source of the Piva River in northern Montenegro. Built between 1573 and 1586, it was rebuilt in another location in 1982. It is the largest Serbian Orthodox church constructed during the Ottoman occupation in the 16th and 17th centuries. Noted for its frescoes, the monastery's treasures also include ritual objects, rare liturgical books, art, objects of precious metals and a psalm from the Crnojeviƒái printing press (1493‚Äì96), which was the first in the Balkans. These are displayed in the monastery's museum. History Founded in 1573, or 1575, and completed in 1586 through the expenditures of the Metropolitan bishop of Zahumlje and Herzegovina Savatije Sokoloviƒá, who later became the Serbian Orthodox patriarch, the monastery is dedicated to the Dormition of the Theotokos. The construction workers were brothers named Gavrilo and Vuka≈°in. Piva Monastery is included within the Eparchy of Budimlja-Nik≈°iƒá. In 1982, a new reservoir, created by the Piva Hydro Electric Project, required moving the monastery. Stone by stone it was moved to the village of Goransko near Lake Mratinje. Geography Location in relation to the Piva River, E-762 road, and villages of Goransko and Plu≈æine Piva Monastery is located in the village of Piva, just south of Goransko in northern Montenegro. It is accessible along the E-762 road, on the way to Srbinje. It lies approximately from Nik≈°iƒá and is south of Plu≈æine. The monastery was originally located at the source of the Piva River, approximately away from and below the junction of the proposed Mratinje Dam, a hydroelectric plant. Begun in 1969 and completed in 1982, the monastery was moved to its current position, which included the removal and replacement of over 1000 fresco fragments, covering .Ambassador's Fund Helps Preserve Frescos of Piva Monastery U.S. Embassy in Podgorica and Montenegro (2008) Piva has the unique distinction of having been built with the permission of the Ottoman rulers over a period of a little more than a decade, from 1573 to 1586. Its founder, the Serbian Metropolitan of Herzegovina, later the Serbian Patriarch, Savatije Sokoloviƒá, was a kinsman of the Grand Vizier, Mehmed Pasha Sokoloviƒá (also known as Sokollu Mehmed Pasha), who was kidnapped from his Serbian home as a boy and rose to become one of the most renowned statesmen to three sultans -- Suleiman the Magnificent, Selim I and Murad III. As a result, the church at Piva monastery contains a fresco depicting Savatije and Sokollu Mehmed Pasha, a rarity for a Christian church adorned with a portrait of a convert. Architecture and fittings Piva is a small stone structure. Its construction includes three naves with a taller middle nave. There is no cupola. The monastery contains archives, a library, and a treasury with 183 books and nearly 280 other items reported in 1991, including ritual objects, rare liturgical books, art and objects of precious metals. Also featured is a psalm from the Crnojeviƒái printing press (1493‚Äì1496), which was the first printing press in the Balkans. It is dated to 1494 and was discovered by chance among other papers in the library of the monastery. Much of the church was decorated by Greek painters between 1604 and 1606 and contains many frescoes. However, the upper porch area was painted by a local priest Strahinja from Budimlje; this included Akathist to the Mother of God. Other parts of the church, dating from 1626, were painted by Kozma who also painted many of the icons on the iconostasis. The icons of St. George and the Dormition of the Virgin are dated to about 1638‚Äì1639. The artist Zograf Longin painted the throne icons of the Mother of God, Christ and Assumption of the Mother of God.

Biography  King was born and grew up outside of Reading, Pennsylvania. She recalls that due to a particular seventh grade teacher, she gave up on achieving good grades and instead played basketball and worked. She then moved to Ireland landing in Dublin first for two years, then to Tipperary, Ireland where she and her husband renovated a farm and she worked with adult literacy students. While in Dublin, before she could obtain a work permit, she read a book a day, often classics she thought she would have read if she studied writing, including \\"a lot of surrealist fiction.\\" She began writing novels while in Dublin. She returned to Pennsylvania in 2004. Writing King wrote seven novels, as well as poetry and short stories, before she published her first novel, and collected more than 400 rejection letters. Her first published work was actually poetry to some university journals in the United States. She was unaware of the young adult market and wrote about adult characters, but the stories often started earlier in the characters' lives and she states, \\"What I was always doing was trying to help teenagers better understand the adults in their lives, and vice versa.\\" King does not plan her novels; she often starts with a character and discovers their personality and their stories as she writes, and then edits heavily. She also often includes magical realism and unconventional structures. Even with an agent, King faced difficulty publishing because it was hard to categorize her work; it was not until an editor asked for \\"something weird\\" that she received a deal and learned about the young adult market. The novel, The Dust of 100 Dogs, was published by the small young adult press Flux in 2009. Since there was already a writer named Amy King, she chose to write with the initials \\"A.S.\\"; the S stands for her maiden name, Sarig. She found this pen name appropriate as she writes gender-neutral novels and it spelled \\"asking\\". Her second novel, Please Ignore Vera Dietz, was bid on by seven different publishing houses. King chose Knopf because of editor Michelle Frey's \\"vision\\" for the novel; other publishing houses wanted to remove the adults in the book. Please Ignore Vera Dietz was a 2011 Michael L. Printz Award Honor Book and an Edgar Allan Poe Award nominee for \\"Best Young Adult\\". Her third young- adult novel, Everybody Sees the Ants, was named one of the Top Ten Books for Young Adults in 2012 and was an Andre Norton Award finalist. Her fourth young- adult novel, Ask the Passengers (2012), won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize. It was also a Lambda Literary Award finalist, and a Library Journal Best YA Books for Adults selection. This was followed by Reality Boy in 2013, which was inspired by wondering if some children on reality television that were presented as entertainment were subject to abuse. Her 2014 novel, Glory O'Brien's History of the Future, follows a character who is actually the daughter of the protagonist in an unpublished novel King wrote in 2004, called Why People Take Pictures. Her short fiction for adults has been published in Washington Square, Contrary, Quality Women's Fiction, Eclectica Magazine, Word Riot, Amarillo Bay, Literary Mama, Underground Voices, The Huffington Post, Lit103.3 and FRiGG. A collection of twelve of her short stories, titled Monica Never Shuts Up, was published in 2012 in ebook format and later in print from Createspace. Little, Brown has announced that King's seventh novel, I Crawl Through It, is forthcoming in September 2015. This will be King's first surrealist novel, a genre she feels she has been moving toward over her writing career. It has also been announced that she will have two novels coming out in 2016 and 2017 respectively, this time with Dutton Children's Books. She will be working with Andrew Karre, who bought her first published book. Expected to be published in 2017 will also be King's first middle grade novel, Finding Marvin Gardens. It will be published by Arthur A. Levine Books (an imprint of Scholastic) and will be written under the name of Amy Sarig King. Awards and recognition King won the 2011 Michael L. Printz Award Honor for Please Ignore Vera Dietz. Ask the Passengers won the annual Los Angeles Times Book Prize for young-adult literature in 2012. In 2015, she was named the \\"Outstanding Pennsylvania Author\\" for that year by the Pennsylvania School Librarians Associations; all of her novels have taken place in the state. King's 2019 novel Dig won the 2020 Michael L.

They criticized the lack of a change view feature (which had by that time become standard for racing games) and the absence of graphical detail, but praised the split-screen multiplayer, highly responsive controls, and the choice of an intense, simplistic arcade mode and a simulation mode which demands careful, thoughtful decision-making from the player. They assessed the Super NES version to be not as good due to the less dramatic visuals and less realistic engine sounds.

The Auckland Rugby League's minor premiership, the Rukutai Shield, is named after him. Early years Rukutai was born at KƒÅwhia and affiliated to the NgƒÅti Hikairo hap≈´ of NgƒÅti Maniapoto. He was educated at St Stephen's School. He started his career playing rugby union and was part of George A. Gillett's Goldfields team that defeated Auckland in 1906. Rukutai was working as a miner at the time. Playing career Rukutai played for the City Rovers in the 1910 and 1911 Auckland Rugby League competition and also toured Australia with the New Zealand MƒÅori team.Coffey, John and Bernie Wood Auckland, 100 years of rugby league, 1909‚Äì2009, 2009. . He first made the New Zealand side in 1911, alongside former Union teammate George Gillett. He only played a handful of matches in his first two season with City Rovers because he was away on tours for Auckland, and New Zealand several times. Rukutai was the first captain of the Manukau Magpies when they entered the Auckland Rugby League competition in 1912. The Manukau senior team disbanded during the 1913 season and he moved back to the City Rovers club were he played until 1919. During the 1913 season he was thought to have contracted Smallpox and at the time he was the only known patient. He was living in Onehunga and was placed in the hospital at Point Chevalier in the isolation ward. His house in Onehunge was \\"thoroughly disinfected\\". It then turned out that he had actually been suffering from a severe case of chicken pox and he recovered well. This was not the end of his health issues in 1913. He fell from a horse on 16 November 1913 and broke his leg just above the right ankle in Mangere. The horse stumbled and fell on to him. He toured Australia with New Zealand in 1911 and 1912 and his career continued after the War when he again toured Australia in 1919. However, Rukutai played in no Test matches as during this time New Zealand played matches against New South Wales and Queensland. In 1923 Rukutai requested to resume his playing career in the Mangere first junior team as a means to \\"coaching in a practical manner\\" however in the Auckland Rugby League Management Committee meeting on 13 June his request was denied. However the following year he was part of the Mangere United team which was a team made from the Manukau and Mangere teams which had been competing in the 2nd grade. Coaching career Rukutai coached New Zealand during their 1921 tour of Australia. He remains New Zealand's youngest ever national coach.Superleague, Volume 6, Issue 4, Edition 28 2011. He also coached New Zealand MƒÅori between 1922 and 1937. In 1937 he coached the New Zealand MƒÅori to an upset win over Australia. Later years and death In 1932 Rukutai served on the Auckland Rugby League board as the Clubs' delegate. He then served as the first chairman of the New Zealand MƒÅori Rugby League Board when it was formed in 1934. Rukutai died at his daughter's residence in the Auckland suburb of Onehunga in 1940, aged 62 years.

He is best known for his work in special education and the psychology of African Americans.http://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/ethnicity- health/psychologists/jones.aspx Early life and family Jones was born in Clearwater, Florida on January 21, 1931 to his mother, Naomi Henry, a homemaker, and his father, Moses Jones, a musician. His parents were never married and he had a younger half-brother and half-sister, both of whom were the children of his mother and stepfather. During his childhood, Florida was still racially segregated and experiences with discrimination were common. Nevertheless, Jones grew up with a supportive community of neighbors and family members. Jones and his family were avid readers of two Black newspapers, the Pittsburgh Courier and the Miami Times. He grew up surrounded by frequent discussions on race, racial differences, and the accomplishments of notable Black figures. Jones also recalls spending summers visiting Pennsylvania, where his father would fervently introduce him to all kinds of people as an attempt to educate him in the \\"ways of the world.\\" His exposure to diverse issues of race and humanity would go on to inform his career and professional interests. Jones was married twice. He first married to Johnette Turner, an artist he met at Ohio State University, and had three daughters with her. In 1988, he married his second wife, Michele Woods, and was the stepfather to her two children.Williams, R. L. (2008). A history of the Association of Black Psychologists: Early formation and development. History of the Association of Black Psychologists: Profiles of Outstanding Black Psychologists, 1. Education Jones grew up attending a Black public elementary school and went to Booker T. Washington High School. He enrolled in Morehouse College in 1948 for his undergraduate education, intending to major in chemistry. However, after a semester of chemistry courses, Jones discovered his interest and talent for psychology. Evelyn Barnett was the only Psychology professor at Morehouse and was one of Jones's first influencers in his psychology career. Jones was also able to take several off-campus courses at Spelman College, Atlanta University, and Clark College. In 1952, he received his bachelor's degree in Psychology from Morehouse. Afterwards he enrolled for the graduate clinical psychology program at Wayne University and completed his thesis on ethnocentrism within White individuals. After completing his MA, in 1954, he was drafted into the U.S. Army as a clinical psychologist. During his two years in the army, Jones was stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky and Bad Cannstatt, Germany. Jones then enrolled in the doctoral program in the Department of Psychology and Educational Psychology at Ohio State University. He was advised by John Horrocks, a developmental psychologist. Jones attributes his expertise to the program's comprehensiveness and breadth, which allowed him to apply psychological principles to his more specialized research in Black psychology and special education. He received his Ph.D in psychology from Ohio State University in 1959. Career Jones was employed at 9 different higher education institutions during his 33-year academic career. Immediately after receiving his Ph.D, he chose to accept a Research Assistant Professor position at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. In 1963, he moved to Fisk University in Nashville to become an Assistant Professor of Psychology. He stayed for a year and advises the master's theses of William Hayes, Moses Johnson, and Angela Owens. He had a brief summer appointment with Indiana University before moving to UCLA in 1964 as an Assistant Professor of Education. There, Jones worked with Frank M. Hewett to develop a Ph.D program in special education. Until then, there was no doctoral program in special education at any of the University of California campuses. Jones helped develop and teach courses in areas of gifted and retarded education, recruit faculty for the program, and form partnerships with California State University, Los Angeles. In 1966, he returned to Ohio State University as an Associate Professor of Psychology. After just two years, he was promoted to full professorship with tenure and was also appointed to Vice Chair for Staff Development. Jones then accepted professorship at University of California, Riverside in their new School of Education. He was a faculty member for two years before becoming the Department Chair. In 1971, Jones moved his career abroad to become Director of the University Testing Center at Halle Sellassie I University in Ethiopia. He spent his two years there mostly responsible for developing admissions tests to the university. He then accepted a position as Professor of African American Studies and Education at the University of California, Berkeley where he spent 17 years - the longest he spent at any one university. In addition to being a professor, he eventually held other academic and administrative positions at UC Berkeley. Finally, he left UC Berkeley in 1991 and Jones ended his career at Hampton University as a Department Chair and Professor of Psychology. He stayed at Hampton until 2001 when he decided to retire. Jones's primary research interests were the education of exceptional children and the psychology of African Americans. His extensive experience at numerous universities helped lay the groundwork for both fields. Apart from his career as a professor, Jones was also one of the founding members of the Association of Black Psychologists and the Association's president from 1971 to 1972. As a leader in establishing Black psychology, Jones was active in pushing the American Psychological Association to provide more support for Black students, faculty, and the community at large. He was highly successful in receiving grants to support minority students and special education research. Jones also contributed to the public sector by being part of President-elect Bill Clinton's Council of Advisors's Education Transition Team, and President Nixon's Task Force on Mental Health.http://www.apa.org/divisions/div45/images/ReginaldJonesCitation.pdf Historical context Jones's influence in Black psychology came at a time when the Black Power Movement sought Black empowerment and recognition for the Black community. In mainstream psychology, studies often concluded that Black- White differences were due to deficiencies in Black people. In an interview, Jones explains the problem with this framework: > Now, the research always has the middle-class black child compared to the > lower-class white child. Nobody ever talked about the middle-class blacks or > upper middle-class blacks. Everything was lower class, and that‚Äôs a problem > of methodology. It‚Äôs a methodological flaw in the research because you need > to have comparable social classes and comparable races to make a valid > comparison. That was never done. So, what happened, since the government was > pouring tens of millions of dollars into studying the black child in > relationship to the middle-class white child‚Äîthere were hundreds, probably > thousands, of research studies‚Äîthey all concluded that on whatever dimension > was studied, practically, the black child was deficient in some way. (Jones, > 2003) Thus, the impetus for establishing the Association of Black Psychologists and for writing Black Psychology was to re-evaluate these biases and legitimize Black psychology as a field created by and for the Black community. Black Psychology First published in 1972, Jones wrote Black Psychology an anthology of works from prominent Black psychologists such as Joseph White, Adelbert Jenkins, and Robert Williams, that seemed \\"positive and relevant to what might be called black psychology.\\".African American Faculty and Senior Staff Oral History Project (2003) http://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/roho/ucb/text/jones_reginald.pdf This seminal book presented the major approaches to establishing Black psychology, and called for rejecting using the White middle class as the psychological norm and for studying the strengths instead of the weaknesses of Black people. Later editions of the book would shift from critiquing mainstream psychology to including more original theory and research. In the third edition, published in 1991, a section called \\"Deconstruction\\" was devoted to critically evaluating the accuracy and validity of mainstream literature. At the time, hundreds of studies concluded that African Americans have an external locus of control and had less ability to delay gratification, meaning that African Americans have less control of their impulses.Zytkoskee, A., Strickland, B. R., & Watson, J. (1971). Delay of gratification and internal versus external control among adolescents of low socioeconomic status. Developmental Psychology, 4(1, Pt.1), 93-98Lefcourt, H. M., & Ladwig, G. W. (1965). The American Negro: A problem in expectancies. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 1(4), 377.Battle, E. S., & Rotter, J. B. (1963). Children's feelings of personal control as related to social class and ethnic group. Journal of personality. Articles in \\"Deconstruction\\" presented studies that debunked these conclusions.Jones, R. L. (1991). Black psychology . Cobb & Henry Publishers. On the contrary, a section titled \\"Reconstruction\\" was devoted to analyzing the strengths of Black people and maintaining psychological well-being while living in a racist society. The fourth edition introduced more research with an Afrocentric perspective, the idea that African culture is ultimately what forms the basis for African American culture and psychology.

It was restructured to form TBfree New Zealand, the title of the programme for which it was responsible for managing before the formation of OSPRI. The Biosecurity Act 1993 allowed any entity to apply for funding for a National Pest Management Strategy (NPMS). The Animal Health Board submitted a proposal to the New Zealand government for a 5-year National Pest Management Strategy (NPMS) for bovine TB in 1995; this was approved in 1998.  Governance and funding  Governance of the AHB was managed by a Board of Directors, appointed by the member organisations through the AHB Representatives‚Äô Committee. It was funded by central government, regional council contributions and the farming sector. TBfree The successor to AHB, TBfree New Zealand and the national animal identification and tracing (NAIT) scheme, are both wholly owned subsidiaries of OSPRI (Operational Solutions for Primary Industries). OSPRI plans to leverage off the capabilities of each of its programmes to help protect and enhance the reputation of New Zealand's primary industries. Like the AHB, OSPRI continues to derive its powers from the Biosecurity Act 1993. OSPRI's mission statement, \\"To protect and enhance the reputation of New Zealand's primary industries\\" is inclusive of its TB eradication efforts and animal traceability work through its NAIT programme. OSPRI is made up of representatives from the farming sector as well as central and local government. It is accountable to its member organisations and also had responsibilities to the Minister for Primary Industries. The TBfree programme is responsible for the AHB's applied research and development programme which, as of July 2013, operated on a budget of approximately $2.5 million per annum.
