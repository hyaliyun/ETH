Goguen, 415 U.S. 566 (1974), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that flag desecration laws that prohibit \\"contemptuous\\" treatment of the flag are overly broad.  Background  Goguen, a teenager from Massachusetts, was arrested by police for wearing a small cloth US flag on the seat of his pants. When arrested, Goguen was standing on the sidewalk, talking; he was not engaged in any demonstration. Goguen was convicted and sentenced to 6 months in jail for violating a flag desecration law encompassing anyone who treats the flag \\"contemptuously\\". His conviction was upheld by the Massachusetts Supreme Court. Assisted by the ACLU, Goguen appealed to the Federal court, and the Federal court overturned his conviction. Massachusetts appealed to the US Supreme Court.  Opinion of the Court  The Supreme Court, in a 6 to 3 decision, sided with Goguen, and ruled that the statute was too vague. The Court partially relied on prior decisions which prohibited states from compelling people to salute the flag: \\"neither the United States nor any State may require any individual to salute or express favorable attitudes toward the flag.\\"  See also  * West Virginia Board of Education v.

Early life Valder was born in Southampton, Hampshire, England, in 1862, the son of Mary Collingridge and George Valder, a corn merchant. He went to a church school in Winchester.  Business  Valder arrived in 1881 and worked as a labourer in the King Country before joining John William Ellis as a partner in his Kihikihi store in 1884. They later set up stores at Otorohanga, Tokaanu and Taupo. By the mid 1890s, Valder was managing the general store of Ellis Brothers and Valder at Hunterville, where main trunk railway construction had boosted the local economy. In 1900 he sold his interest in the stores and returned to England, but returned next year. Valder renewed his business links with J. W. Ellis, becoming managing director of Ellis and Burnand from 1908 until 1932 and chairman of the board from 1918 to 1942. Like Ellis, he had taught himself MƒÅori, gaining his interpreter's licence in 1889. They used their many MƒÅori contacts to acquire rights to fell and mill native bush. Valder was also a long-time district representative and vice president (1917‚Äì26) on the Dominion Federated Sawmillers' Association.  Social work  In 1922, Valder promoted industrial partnership by publishing a plan to give employees shares in profits and directors on boards in a co-partnerships. The result was the 1924 Companies Empowering Act. He founded the Employee‚ÄìPartnership Institute in 1927, but couldn't get enough support from his co-directors to convert Ellis and Burnand to such a model. In 1927 the Waikato and King Country Press (now absorbed by Waitomo News) was one of the few to use the legislation. In 1940 Henry financed a fellowship which produced a 'Report on industrial relations in New Zealand' in 1946. Valder was also founder president of the Rotary Club of Hamilton in 1923, chaired the Waikato Social Welfare League in 1932, co- founded the Waikato Land Settlement Society and, in 1940, helped Te Puea Herangi buy Turangawaewae. These works gained him the Reconnaissance fran√ßaise and, in the 1948 New Year Honours, Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services in promoting industrial relations.  Family life  Whilst briefly in England, Valder married Ellen (Nellie) Green on 17 January 1901 at Edingthorpe. Later that year they sailed back to live in Auckland, before moving to Hamilton three years later. They had three daughters, Ellen Mary (Mollie), Norah Winifred and Lilian.Miropiko Reserve was created about 1980. Valder's youngest daughter, Lilian, died on 5 August 2001, aged 90. She went to Sonning School and St. Cuthbert's College, was a secretary and, from 1930 to 1963, developed a farm from bush below Mt Pirongia with her sister Mollie. Lilian retired to Waihi Beach in 1963, where she volunteered for St. John in their beach first aid caravan, meals on wheels and driving patients to Thames, Waikato and Tauranga Hospitals. In 1989 she set up the Valder Ohinemuri Charitable Trust for youth, people at risk and the elderly. In the 1993 New Year Honours, she was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the community. Her sister, Norah Winifred Howell, had earlier set up a charitable trust in 1984. Henry Valder planted many native trees in the grounds of his Hamilton riverside home, Edingthorpe. He was a keen follower of cricket and enjoyed social tennis. Although not a religious man he attended the Anglican church because of the commitment of his wife, Ellen. She died on 2 June 1931. Valder married a widow, Marie (Daisy) Herbert (formerly Quelch) in Thames on 11 April 1934. He died suddenly at home on 12 February 1950, survived by his three daughters and second wife.

The complex consists of two buildings: Irving Hall and Columbian Hall. Irving Hall is the older building, dating from about 1856. It is a three-story, \\"U\\"-shaped brick building with wood trim in the Italianate style. An extension to the building was built about 1900. Columbian Hall, built in 1893, is a three-story, rectangular brick building with a wood frame addition. It is in a combined Italianate / Spanish Renaissance Revival style. It features a projecting stair tower with a semi-conical roof. Both Irving Hall and Columbian Hall were converted to apartments in the late-1930s. The complex formerly included a third building, known as \\"Argyle,\\" which was the home of the Irving College president. Built in 1911, it was a rectangular Spanish Renaissance Revival style dwelling, with a low hipped roof and wraparound verandah. Note: This includes \\"Argyle\\" was demolished in 1991 to make room for expansion of Seidle Hospital.Reppert, Byron L., Mechanicsburg, Arcadia Publishing, 2010, p. 80. The Irving College complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. History Irving Female College was established in 1856, at a time when educational opportunities were expanding for women across the United States. Its founder was Mechanicsburg businessman Solomon Gorgas, who named the college in honor of the noted American author Washington Irving.Leinaweaver, Chad A., \\"Irving College: Its Life, Its Study, Its Women,\\" master's thesis, Northeastern University, 1998, pp. 19, 21. Irving offered a traditional liberal arts education, culminating in either a Bachelor of Arts or a less rigorous \\"Mistress of English Literature\\" degree. Like many women's colleges of the era, Irving ran preparatory classes for those who could not meet the academic requirements for admission.Leinaweaver, \\"Irving College,\\" pp. 184, 187. Low enrollment and poor management forced a temporary closure of the college in 1883. It reopened in 1888 and prospered under the leadership of E.E. Campbell, who became president in 1891 and purchased the college outright in 1898.Leinaweaver, Chad, \\"The Deterioration of the Seminary Rule System at Irving College, 1909-1926,\\" Cumberland County History, Summer 1998, p. 51; Leinaweaver, \\"Irving College,\\" 45-46. For the next two decades, enrollment stayed consistently at or above 100 ‚Äì residential, commuting and part-time students. In 1895 the college added a music department and changed its name to Irving College and Conservatory of Music.Leinaweaver, \\"Irving College,\\" 47, 51. The curriculum later expanded to include shorter secretarial and home economics courses, to appeal to new career fields opening up to women.Leinaweaver, \\"Seminary Rule,\\" p. 51. Most graduates who found paid employment outside the home gravitated toward teaching. Two of the most notable chose less typical pursuits: Ida Kast, Class of 1892, became the first woman admitted to the practice of law in Cumberland County; Jane Deeter Rippon '02 worked first as a social worker in New York, then rose to be national executive director of the Girl Scouts.Leinaweaver, \\"Irving College,\\" p. 175. In the 1920s, Irving College suffered from limited financial resources, competition from coeducational schools, and an inability to meet increasingly rigorous standards for higher education. It closed permanently after the 1929 graduation.Leinaweaver, \\"Irving College,\\" p. 84. Alumnae held regular reunions into the 1990s. They donated their collection of college memorabilia to the Joseph T. Simpson Public Library in Mechanicsburg.Brosious, Patricia A., \\"Irving College,\\" Pennsylvania Magazine, March‚ÄìApril 1994, p. 31.

Since its 2003 inception, the movement has been repeatedly harassed by security officials as an illegal political organization, the Cuban Communist Party being Cuba's only legal organization. Arrest At a protest in Havana on November 30, 2010, Malleza was arrested along with her husband Ignacio Mart√≠nez Montejo. She and her husband were holding a banner reading \\"Stop hunger, misery and poverty in Cuba\\" in Havana's Fraternity Park. Two police officers confiscated the banner, handcuffed her and Mart√≠nez, and put them into a police vehicle as a surrounding crowd demanded their release. When onlooker and fellow protester Isabel Haydee Alvarez Mosqueda objected to their arrest, she was detained as well. Malleza and Alvarez were both transferred to Havana's Manto Negro women‚Äôs jail. The three prisoners were held without charge, though their relatives were told the three were being investigated for \\"public disorder\\".

The company made models for the Carlo Biscaretti di Ruffia Automobile Museum in Turin (Museo dell'automobile Carlo Biscaretti di Ruffia, Torino). They were made from approximately 1961‚Äì1975, and perhaps a few years longer. History and rationale In the early 1960s, Bartolomeo Chiodo, an auto enthusiast, named his company Dugu from the name of one of the two districts of Varallo Sesia that was Mr. Chiodo's home ‚Äì 'Dugu' means owl (the other district was 'falcet' ‚Äì meaning falcon; Castellarin 2002). So, 'Owl Models' was born in 1961 and the logo for the company became a stylized angular owl with large round yellow eyes (Ralston 2009, p. 63). This follows somewhat of a tradition of other European toy companies naming named their lines after cute or diminutive animals (e.g. Corgi, Husky, or Budgie). The first Dugu Miniautotoys were made by Stampopolastica for a year, and like the name some of the first Dugus were molded in plastic (Spano 2016). In 1962, Stampopolastica started making its own models under the Rio name). Chiodo then started making his own models and thus the Dugu line was similar in concept to Rio Models, Brumm, or Minialuxe. Later a new line made Italian makes for the Ruffia Automobile Museum (Force 1992, p. 131-135). These models were mostly vehicles featured in the museum and sold in the museum store. 1970s collector Cecil Gibson stated that normal Dugus for retail sale were more complex, while the ones available for the Museum (the 'Museo' series) were less detailed, which seems 'cart before the horse' (Force 1992; p. 131; Gibson 1971, p. 49). Still, the company was similar to the German Cursor Models or French RAMI by J.M.K. which mainly made models for the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Germany and, respectively, models in the Malartre collection in the Ch√¢teau de Rochetaill√©e-sur-Sa√¥ne in France. Dugu and Rio, thus were two of the earliest model makers of veteran age cars, setting the stage for Solido, Corgi, Brumm and several other manufacturers to make toys representing the nascent auto era (Richardson 1999, p. 134). Marques Marques reproduced were mainly Italian, like FIAT, Lancia, Itala, SAME and FIAT tractors, Legnano, Brixia, Cisitalia, and Bernardi, but French and German makes like Peugeot, Darracq, DeDion, and Benz were also produced (Castellarin 2002). A couple of Duesenbergs also appeared, with the input and encouragement of American diecast marketer, David Sinclair, who was responsible for introducing many of these more obscure European brands to American soil (Sinclair 1979, p. 387). In the Dugu catalog, the Bernardi was proudly hailed as the first Italian motorized vehicle, made in 1896, and the 1899 FIAT 3.5 hp heralded as the first FIAT produced ‚Äì ever (Dugu catalog). Also, though most models were of vehicles made before 1930, a few like the Cisitalia, the Fiat 500 Topolino, and the SAME Centauro tractor were post war representations (Dugu catalog; Ralston 2009, p. 66). As with Rio and Brumm, many models were made in 'top up' or 'top down' versions, though Dugu models, while respected, were generally not seen as quite up to the standards of Rio (Sinclair 1979, p. 387). The 1911 FIAT 4 was listed as giving important service in World War I. The tractor and truck models (probably not made for the museum) were produced in 1:15 scale. Apparently, with the urging of the Pennsylvanian model collector and importer David Sinclair, two American models were also made ‚Äì a Duesenberg town car and a Cord 812 (Sinclair 1979, p. 387). At least one model was announced, but never produced. This was the 1923 FIAT Eldridge 'Mefistofele' record car, a model later made by Zeppelin. The Cisitalia 202 An analysis of one nice Dugu offering is the 1946 Cisitalia 202 by Pininfarina ‚Äì a sleek car that was to completely change sports car design during the 1950s (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, p. 36). Like most Dugus it was offered in 1:43 scale about the year 1974. The shape of the car is perfectly rendered in miniature with some details very strikingly portrayed while others seem overgeneralized (Richardson 1999, p. 134). The Cisitalia grille is oversimplified with large chrome bars. Though the hood is a separate piece ‚Äì it does not open and there is no engine detail. Dugus were more crude and simplistic than colorful Safirs, all metal RAMI or Rio Models which commonly had opening parts. One author called Dugu models \\"dainty\\", probably for all the veteran era details (Rixon 2005, p. 72). The Cisitalia's exhaust port tubes on the front fenders behind the wheel wells were impressively blacked out and the Pininfarina logo just below them was accurately portrayed in blue and white, if made a bit large in order to catch the eye on this small model. The interior is black plastic, as is the base for the chassis. The interior is not very detailed, but it is not very visible in any case. With the instrument cowell on the right side, the car modeled appears to have been right hand drive. The body paint is shiny, but slightly uneven. The wire wheels are plastic unlike those of the Politoys M series, but they are authentic looking being darkened between the spokes and with 'spinner' caps, though the plastic of their rims is not finished smoothly or evenly. The car's bulb-like headlights are clear plastic which is usually realistic and probably better than the gemstone approach taken by Dinky and Corgi, but though glass-like, on close inspection they protrude, fish-like and make the car look nearsighted. Authentic looking license plates top it all off. It is a very effective model if one doesn't gripe about the details. Other details were finer than those of models produced by other companies. Sometimes detailed chains were seen in drive systems. Steering wheels were accurate to the real vehicles portrayed and in the case of the 1907 FIAT F2 race car, copper wiring was actually used to show copper tubing to and from the fuel tank of the actual vehicle. Packaging The Dugu museum models' packaging is intriguing and apparently done to mimic other 1:43 scale modelers, but also to be appropriate for museum sales. The Cisitalia's box panels alternate in blue and yellow with the name of the museum on the blue sides. The round seal of the museum appears on the end flaps with a representation of the 1899 'first' FIAT. The flat yellow sides of the box show the Cisistalia in profile and the opposite side names the car with bookman- like type font in blue. The overall packaging effect looks more like something from the 1950s than the 1970s. This box design rather mimics blue and yellow themes seen with other 1:43 diecast producers like Corgi, but lacks much marketing ornamentation or flair ‚Äì perhaps emphasizing that this model was to be more of an 'official' museum offering. Also the Dugu owl logo only appears in one place on the yellow boxes. Later models were packaged under more clear plastic and the earlier yellow and blue or yellow and green packaging colors gave way to more of a subtle and less toy-like black, white and minimalist yellow paper colors under clear plastic display cases usually with black plastic bases (Spano 2016). The black cardboard boxes usually had circular clear plastic windows. Demise The Dugu company apparently changed its name to Sispla in 1974, but lasted only until 1975. Some of the last models appeared without the Dugu name neither on box nor model (Force 1992, p. 131). The reason for this may have been that the last were announced by Dugu, but made by other local manufacturers. A model or two found continued production with other companies, like the Eldridge 1923 FIAT which was announced by Dugu, but then later produced by a Milan shop named Zeppelin (Spano 2016). Zeppelin made one thousand copies of the race car. Some of the Dugu Models also appeared later in the series of the brand Oldcars (Force 1992, p. 131). References * Castellarin, Danilo. 2002.

Born in England, he and his brother emigrated in New Zealand in 1895 and worked as farm labourers. In 1900, he joined the New Zealand military to serve in South Africa during the Boer War. He wrote extensively of life as a soldier and many of his letters were published in newspapers. After his service ended, he began farming and also was active in the Legion of Frontiersmen, eventually becoming its New Zealand commandant. During the First World War, he served at Gallipoli, on the Western Front and in Palestine. He died of wounds received in an action in Palestine. Early life Francis Morphet Twisleton, known as Frank, was born on 17 February 1873 in Settle, Yorkshire, England to a farmer and his wife. After completing his education, he went farming in Yorkshire. In 1895, he emigrated in New Zealand with his brother Thomas, and worked his way around the country as a farm labourer. Boer War In January 1900 he joined the Second New Zealand Contingent, which was being raised for service in the Boer War. He arrived in South Africa the following month. Thomas followed him to South Africa as part of the Fourth New Zealand Contingent but was killed in action in 1901. Frank served as a mounted soldier in the country until May 1901. He wrote home regularly and his letters were published in a number of newspapers in New Zealand. Following his return to New Zealand, these letters formed the basis of a book, entitled With the New Zealanders at the front: a story of twelve months' campaigning in South Africa. In the book, he commented extensively on the competence of British Army officers as well as the treatment of soldiers. Interwar period Twisleton based himself near Gisborne and took up farming. In 1905, he married Emily Mary Speedy, and the couple would go on to have two daughters. In 1911 he became involved with the Legion of Frontiersmen, an organisation which found favour with many veterans of the Boer War like Twisleton. It was run along military lines with imperialist sympathies with an aim to provide men with military skills should they be required for service in the British Empire. Twisleton was involved in organising and training of a squadron of horsemen for the Legion's Poverty Bay branch. He eventually was appointed the New Zealand commandant of the Legion. First World War After the Legion's offer of the services of two squadrons of horsemen was rejected by the New Zealand government following the outbreak of the First World War, Twisleton enlisted in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force. He was assigned to the Otago Mounted Rifles Regiment, with which he landed at Gallipoli nearly a month after the Landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915. A lieutenant, he continued his letter writing habits of the Boer War, regularly describing life in the trenches in correspondence home. As with his previous writing, British officers were often the subject of criticism. He was awarded the Military Cross for his services during the Gallipoli Campaign, which saw him involved in the Battle of Hill 60. He was also mentioned in despatches. He became ill with dysentery and was evacuated from Gallipoli in September 1915. After recovering his health, Twisleton was posted to the New Zealand Pioneer Battalion, which was a mainly MƒÅori unit but with a company drawn from the Otago Mounted Rifles. Promoted to captain, Twisleton served with the battalion on the Western Front from March 1916 to August 1917. His wife and daughters had moved to England and he was able to regularly see them when on leave. In October 1917 he was transferred to the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment, which was serving in the Palestine Theatre of Operations and shortly afterwards was promoted to major and given command of a squadron of horsemen. On 14 November 1917, he was involved in the Battle of Ayun Kara and was severely wounded. He died of his wounds the next day.Powles, 1922, p. 148 He is buried at Ramleh War Cemetery, in Israel. After Twisleton's death, the Legion of Frontiersmen recognised his services with the Pioneer Axe, its highest award. His widow was made an honorary lieutenant of the Legion.

The dynasty was founded in 1843 by Rabbi Shlomo Hakohen Rabinowicz (the Tiferes Shlomo), one of the great Hasidic masters of 19th-century Poland. His son, grandson and great-grandson led the dynasty in turn, attracting thousands of followers. On the eve of World War II, Radomsk was the third largest Hasidic dynasty in Poland, after Ger and Alexander. The town of Radomsko was destroyed and most of its Jews deported and killed during the German occupation of Poland in World War II. The fourth Radomsker Rebbe, Rabbi Shlomo Chanoch Hakohen Rabinowicz, was murdered by the Nazis in the Warsaw Ghetto in 1942, bringing the father-to-son dynasty to an end. In 1965, Radomsker Hasidim who had survived the Holocaust and were living in Israel asked Rabbi Menachem Shlomo Bornsztain, the fifth Sochatchover Rebbe and a descendant of the first Radomsker Rebbe, to become their Rebbe as well, and he agreed. Bornsztain's son, Rabbi Avrohom Nosson Bornsztain, is the current Rav of the Radomsker shul in Bnei Brak.. History Leadership Great Synagogue in Radomsk The founder of the dynasty was Rabbi Shlomo Hakohen Rabinowicz (the Tiferes Shlomo) (1801-1866), who had begun serving as Rav of Radomsko (Radomsk) in 1834. Under his leadership, the Jewish community of Radomsk grew both in prestige and population. When Grand Rabbi Moshe Biderman of Lelov moved to the Land of Israel and instructed his Hasidim to follow Rabinowicz, the latter's influence as a Rebbe grew significantly and Radomsk became a major Hasidic center. The masses revered their Rebbe for his lofty prayers, beautiful singing voice, and benevolence towards their needs, while the more scholarly Hasidim admired his profound discourses in Halakha and Kabbalah. Rabinowicz's discourses on the Chumash and Jewish holidays were published posthumously in Warsaw in 1867-1869 as the two-volume Tiferes Shlomo. This work, considered a textbook of Hasidic thought, met with widespread acclaim and has been continuously reprinted.Finkel, Kabbalah, p. 349. Upon the Rebbe's death in 1866, his youngest son, Avraham Yissachar Dov Hakohen Rabinowicz (1843-1892), succeeded him. Rabbi Avraham Yissachar Dov was also a great Torah scholar and was musically gifted. After he became Rebbe, he attracted many Hasidim from Poland and Galicia. He suffered from diabetes and died in Radomsk a year shy of his fiftieth birthday. His Torah teachings were compiled under the title Chesed L'Avraham, published in Piotrkow in 1893. He was succeeded as Rebbe by his second son, Rabbi Yechezkel Hakohen Rabinowicz (1864-1910), who had initially served as Rav of Novipola. The third Radomsker Rebbe was known for his dedication to Torah study, his extreme modesty, and powerful sermons. He suffered from diabetes like his father and also died before the age of 50. An estimated 25,000 people attended his funeral from all over Poland and Galicia. His Torah teachings were compiled under the title Kenesses Yechezkel, published in 1913. His eldest son, Rabbi Shlomo Chanoch Hakohen Rabinowicz (1882-1942), succeeded him. The fourth Radomsker Rebbe was a dynamic and charismatic leader. Thousands of Hasidim attended his court on Shabbat and Jewish holidays. The Rebbe was also quite wealthy. He owned a glass factory and homes in Berlin, Warsaw, and Sosnowiec; he re-established his court in the latter city after World War I. He also amassed a huge personal collection of old manuscripts and prints that was said to be the second-largest private library in Poland after that of the Gerrer Rebbe. Keser Torah yeshiva network The fourth Radomsker Rebbe innovated a new trend in Hasidic education in Poland. Until World War I, Hasidic youth traditionally studied Torah and learned the customs and lore of their dynasties in shtiebelach (small houses of prayer and study) across Poland. As the war uprooted hundreds of thousands of Jews and decimated established communities, the shtiebelach lost their central place in Hasidic life. In 1926, the Rebbe announced his plan to create a network of yeshivas called Keser Torah (Crown of Torah). By 1930, nine yeshivas were functioning in major Polish cities, together with a \\"Kibbutz Govoha\\" (high-level study group) for advanced students and avreichim (married students) in Sosnowiec. The Rebbe appointed his new son-in-law, Rabbi Dovid Moshe Hakohen Rabinowicz (1906-1942), to serve as rosh yeshiva for the entire network. By 1939, there were 36 Keser Torah yeshivas enrolling over 4,000 students in Poland and Galicia. The Rebbe paid for the entire operation, including staff salaries, food, and student lodging, out of his own pocket. World War II Memorial to Rabbi Shlomo Chanoch Rabinowicz in the Warsaw Jewish cemetery. On the eve of World War II, Radomsk was the third largest Hasidic dynasty in Poland, after Ger and Alexander. In Krak√≥w, there were more Radomsker shtiebelach than Gerrer shtiebelach. Following the German invasion of Poland, the Keser Torah yeshivas disbanded and the Rebbe escaped to the town of Alexander, but from there was most likely sent by the Nazis into the Warsaw Ghetto. His son-in- law, Rabbi Dovid Moshe Rabinowicz, was also incarcerated in the Warsaw Ghetto, where he continued to deliver shiurim to Keser Torah students. The Rebbe and all the members of his family, including his only daughter, son-in-law, and their infant son, were shot to death during the Aktion of 1 August 1942. They were buried in a mass grave in Warsaw's main cemetery. With the Rebbe's death, the father-to-son lineage of Radomsker rebbes came to an end. (The Rebbe's brother, Rabbi Elimelech Aryeh Hakohen Rabinowicz, died in Mauthausen.Rabinowicz, Tzvi, The World of Hasidism, p. 175.) Rebirth in Israel After World War II, Radomsker Hasidim and Keser Torah yeshiva students who had survived the Holocaust established Kollel Keser Torah in Bnei Brak, Israel. In 1965 they approached Rabbi Menachem Shlomo Bornsztain, son of the Sochatchover Rebbe and a nephew of Rabbi David Moshe Rabinowicz, to lead the kollel (Bornsztain was also a direct descendant of the first Radomsker Rebbe, as his grandfather, the second Sochatchover Rebbe, married the daughter of the first Radomsker Rebbe.) Bornsztain accepted the offer and commuted from his home in Tel Aviv to Bnei Brak.Growise, Yisroel Alter. \\"The Sochatchover Rebbe, Harav Menachem Shlomo Bornstein, zt\\"l, 40 Years Since His Tragic Passing\\". Hamodia Features section, 27 August 2009, pp. C4-5. When Bornsztain acceded to the leadership of the Sochatchov dynasty in 1965, the Radomsker Hasidim asked him to become their Rebbe as well, and he officially became known as the Sochatchover-Radomsker Rebbe. Following Bornsztain's untimely death in 1969, his eldest son, Rabbi Shmuel Bornsztain, became the Sochatchover Rebbe and another son, Avrohom Nosson Bornsztain, was appointed as the rav of the Radomsker shul in Bnei Brak. Today Radomsker communities exist in Jerusalem and Bnei Brak, Israel; Brooklyn, New York; Lakewood, New Jersey; and Montreal, Canada. The Radomsker Rav of Boro Park, Rabbi Leibish Frand, heads a Radomsker beis medrash in Brooklyn. Music of Radomsk The first Radomsker Rebbe, Rabbi Shlomo Hakohen Rabinowicz, had a beautiful singing voice and was renowned as a hazzan and composer of Hasidic music. He composed and sang new nigunim (melodies) each year for the High Holy days and Jewish holidays. He also sent money to one of his Hasidim in Safed, Israel so the latter would organize a Radomsker Shalosh Seudos meal every Shabbat at which his niggunim would be sung. The second Radomsker Rebbe was also musically gifted, and the niggunim of the first two Radomsker Rebbes were sung in all Radomsker courts. Rabbi Chaskel Besser, a prominent Radomsker Hasid in New York after World War II, produced an album titled Niggunei Radomsk (Melodies of Radomsk) to preserve the music of the dynasty.

History Construction St. Ebba's was the third hospital to be built within the Epsom Cluster, opening in 1904. The colony was designed for the London County Council by William C. Clifford Smith and constructed at a cost of ¬£98,000 to house a total of 326 epileptic patients, 60 of whom were female. The hospital consisted of eight free-standing villas housing 38 patients each centered on a central block containing administrative offices, a recreation hall and other hospital services as well as a 32-bed admission ward for female patients. Epileptic colony Thorn Villa, one of the wards remaining open in 2010. In the hospital's first year 315 patients were admitted, 25% of whom had attempted suicide at one time. Nearly 50% were regarded as of faulty heredity. A well-defined history of head injury or severe falls was found in 14% and a further 14% had arteriosclerosis. Patients received regular treatment including doses of bromide of strontium and a specially regulated diet. By the end of the year 17 of the 315 patients had died. In 1918 the hospital became the Ewell War Hospital for treating neurasthenic ex-servicemen returning from the First World War, administered by the Ministry of Pensions. Psychiatric hospital In 1927 the hospital was returned to the LCC for use as a mental hospital. It was renamed the Ewell Mental Hospital and under the Mental Treatment Act 1930, became one of the first ever voluntary admission public mental hospitals. The LCC made special provision for patients with acute or recent illnesses to be admitted on a voluntary basis for no more than two years before being transferred elsewhere. Medical students from various London teaching hospitals attended the hospital on rotation, while consultant staff from the hospital held out-patient clinics in London. The Hospital also established a working relationship with nearby HMP Wandsworth, providing treatment to prisoners with mental health problems when necessary. Between 1935 and 1938 the hospital was expanded to provide 933 beds and in 1938 it was renamed St. Ebba's Hospital. By the late 1940s, some 95‚Äì97% of patients at the hospital had been admitted voluntarily and in 1948 the Hospital joined the National Health Service as part of the South West Metropolitan Regional Board. Unlike the other hospitals in the Epsom Cluster, patients continued to be admitted from all of the London Metropolitan Regions, except for the North West. In 1949 an adolescent unit was established for patients aged between 12‚Äì17 years and at the same time an occupational therapy department opened: Able-bodied patients worked in the laundry and workshops, while those too ill to leave the wards practised handicrafts. Patients could also attend discussion groups and classes in music appreciation, art, drama, dancing and dress-making or produce plays, make use of the social club or even contribute to 'Trees' the hospital's own weekly magazine. Mental handicap hospital In 1962, the hospital changed use to cater for mentally subnormal patients. Most of the psychiatric patients were sent to hospitals nearer their homes and the wards were renovated to provide 470 beds: 183 for the mentally ill and 287 for the mentally retarded. Later the remaining psychiatric patients were transferred to other hospitals and the Adolescent Unit moved to Long Grove Hospital. In 1969 an Industrial Training Unit opened in one of the villas which provided training in skills and handicrafts for 200 patients. A cement products factory opened in 1971 which employed patients to produce paving slabs in a variety of sizes and colours. By 1979 St. Ebba's Hospital had 629 beds, making it the largest hospital for the mentally handicapped in the district. Decline and redevelopment Service block and water tower during redevelopment in 2010. By 1987 patient numbers were declining and a Parents and Relatives Group was formed to campaign for the retention of the site as a village for people with learning disabilities. By 1995 the Hospital had 484 beds and patients were being rehoused in community homes. In 2004 work began to convert and upgrade some of the old buildings for 55 long-stay handicapped patients. In 2008 a purpose-built Therapy Suite with a new hydrotherapy pool was opened by the Mayor of Epsom and Ewell. As of 2011, most of the hospital buildings were being redeveloped with only a small number of patients remaining on site.

The name was originally coined for a network of 36 yeshivas in pre-war Poland founded by the fourth Radomsker Rebbe, Rabbi Shlomo Chanoch Hakohen Rabinowicz and led by his son-in-law, Rabbi David Moshe Hakohen Rabinowicz . Establishment in Poland World War I uprooted hundreds of thousands of Eastern European Jews and decimated established communities. Thousands of shtiebelach (small houses of prayer and study) in which Hasidic youth traditionally learned the customs and lore of their dynasties were destroyed. On Lag BaOmer 1926, Rabbi Shlomo Chanoch Hakohen Rabinowicz, the fourth Radomsker Rebbe and a prominent Polish Hasidic leader, announced his plan to innovate a new trend in Hasidic education before a gathering of Radomsker Hasidim. He declared: > \\"The time has come to found yeshivas where the younger generation will be > able to learn and toil in Torah. We must plant the light of Torah in every > city in Poland. Until now, everybody learned where he desired and what he > desired. Times have changed and today the necessity is to set up organized > yeshivas and appoint roshei yeshivas who will educate our youth. The > yeshivas will be called Keser Torah\\". Soon after the Rebbe's announcement, eight yeshivas were opened - in Bƒôdzin, Podg√≥rze, Chrzan√≥w, Wolbrom, O≈õwiƒôcim, Czƒôstochowa, ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and Krak√≥w. In the city of Sosnowiec, the Rebbe also founded Kibbutz Govoha, a high-level study group exclusively for advanced students and avreichim (married students). He appointed his new son-in-law, Rabbi David Moshe Hakohen Rabinowicz (1906-1942), a brilliant Torah scholar, to head it. Rabbi David Moshe, a first cousin of the Rebbe, married the Rebbe's only daughter in 1929. He also served as rosh yeshiva of the entire Keser Torah network, monitoring students' progress, delivering shiurim, and administering the end of the semester tests. By 1930, nine yeshivas and the kibbutz were functioning. Over the following decade, more yeshivas were added. On the eve of World War II, there were 36 Keser Torah yeshivas enrolling over 4,000 students in Poland. Though Hasidic in nature, the yeshivas did not promote Radomsker Hasidism, nor were students and staff exclusively Radomsker Hasidim. (In Sosnowiec, for example, the rosh yeshiva was a Ger Hasid.) Each yeshiva had its own rosh yeshiva and initially studied its own masechta (section of the Talmud); later, all the yeshivas studied the same masechta at the same time. To encourage a high level of learning, the yeshiva network also produced its own Torah journal containing the best chidushim (original Torah thoughts) by students, together with shiurim by the rosh yeshivas. The Radomsker Rebbe paid for the entire operation, including staff salaries, food, and student lodging, out of his own pocket. With the German invasion of Poland in 1939, the yeshivas disbanded. The Radomsker Rebbe and Rabbi Dovid Moshe Rabinowicz were both incarcerated in the Warsaw Ghetto, where the latter continued to give regular shiurim. The Rebbe and all the members of his family, including his only daughter, son-in- law, and their infant son, were shot to death during the Aktion of 1 August 1942. Rebirth in Israel After World War II, Radomsker Hasidim and Keser Torah yeshiva students who had survived the Holocaust founded Kollel Keser Torah in Bnei Brak, Israel. In 1965 they asked Rabbi Menachem Shlomo Bornsztain, son of the Sochatchover Rebbe and a nephew of Rabbi David Moshe Rabinowicz, to head the kollel. Bornsztain, who became known as the Sochatchover-Radomsker Rebbe, died in an automobile accident in 1969.Growise, Yisroel Alter. \\"The Sochatchover Rebbe, Harav Menachem Shlomo Bornstein, zt\\"l, 40 Years Since His Tragic Passing\\".

Her efforts, since then, along with volunteers, members, doctors, professionals and others, have been devoted to work towards the eradication of this disease. Goals and objectives Disease control Awareness: by holding lectures and distributing free pamphlets about Meningitis in Jordan. Vaccine: Vaccination is the only public health tool available to prevent the vast majority of HIB disease. There is no vaccine yet available against all strains of Meningitis. Research continues in many countries abroad to develop vaccines against the most common strains and to find better ways of controlling the disease. Over 40 countries have included HIB vaccines in their expanded programs of immunization. In October 1998, the JMF received a grant, generously provided by the Embassy of Japan in Jordan, to purchase Hib vaccine. Through this grass-root grant, a first step was taken to establish a pilot project in East Amman with plans for expansion into a second rural area. The pilot project would protect approximately 10,000 children from the HIB disease. Research: Jordanian Meningitis Foundation supports research and studies which help in controlling the disease.COST EFFECTIVENESS STUDY OF HIB VACCINATION FOR CHILDREN BELOW 5 YEARS IN JORDAN Caring for victims of meningitis * Financial aid for the low income households to take care of disabled Meningitis victims. * Increase access to aid tools and medication for disabled Meningitis victims. * Ensure specialized services to disabled Meningitis victims, both through institutions and through the community based on training. * Opportunities in education and training for lucky survivors of Meningitis.

The tariff on the duty on imported wheat is lowered from 75 lire a tonne to 50 lire. In 1897 the wheat harvest in Italy was substantially lower than the years before; it fell from on average 3.5 million tons in 1891‚Äì95 to 2.4 million tons that year.

In order to try to diminish the rising prices the government of Antonio Di Rudin√¨ was urged to abolish the duty on imported wheat. The lowering of the tariff is generally considered to be too little and too late. Street demonstrations demanding \\"bread and work\\" began in the South of Italy, which already had seen widespread revolts by the Fasci Siciliani in 1893‚Äì94. In towns like Bari and Naples rioting could be suppressed, while Florence was controlled by demonstrators for a whole day.\\"Riots at Milan\\", in The Cambridge Modern History (1904) The situation escalated when demonstrators were shot by nervous policemen, and rioting increased.

It is the third and final single that was released from the album. Like Clapton's \\"Strange Brew\\", the song was originally recorded with other lyrics. The original version, titled \\"She Rides\\", is available on the expanded edition of the album. Composition AllMusic writer Matthew Greenwald notes, the song is \\"led by a striking electric guitar riff\\" with \\"the melody [being] woven elegantly around the simple, almost folk-like chord changes\\". Speaking to the lyrics, the critic recalled \\"the clever use of \\"rain\\" and \\"reign\\" regarding the power of love is the core here\\" and thinks that \\"Clapton and Bramlett utilize it quite well\\". Regarding the instrumental music work on the title, Greenwald finishes his song analysis by stating the \\"song has some striking instrumental sections, including a lovely, brief section by Stephen Stills\\". The song is in the key of D major. The melody has a strong resemblance to that of Stills's own song \\"Questions\\", recorded by both Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. Release The song was released with the B-side of \\"Easy Now\\" in 1972 on a 7\\" vinyl gramophone record. Besides being released as a single in 1972 and on the original album in 1970, the song is featured on various compilation albums, including Eric Clapton at His Best (1972), Backtrackin' (1984), Crossroads (1988), The Cream of Clapton (1995) and Complete Clapton (2007). A live interpretation of the track can be found on the video album Live at Montreux 1986, released on September 19, 2006. In total, the track has been released on over 15 albums. Live concert versions by Derek & the Dominoes are featured on their albums In Concert (1973) and Live at the Fillmore (1994). Critical reception In his review of Clapton's debut album, AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine likes that the title \\"features extended solos\\". He also notes, that the song consists of a \\"pop element\\". Fellow critic Greenwald recalls the piece as \\"one of Eric Clapton's first self-written classics\\" and goes on to say the song \\"showcased the influence that Delaney Bramlett\\" had on Clapton at the time.

Alabama, 294 U.S. 600 (1935), was a United States Supreme Court case which held that an African-American defendant is denied due process rights if the jury pool excludes African-Americans. Background This case was the second landmark decision arising out of the Scottsboro Boys trials (the first was the 1932 case, Powell v. Alabama). Haywood Patterson, along with several other African-American defendants, were tried for raping two white women in 1931 in Scottsboro, Alabama. The trials were rushed, there was virtually no legal counsel, and no African-Americans were permitted in the jury. All defendants, including Patterson, were convicted. The Communist Party of the United States assisted the defendants and appealed to the Supreme Court, which overturned the convictions in 1932 (in the Powell v. Alabama decision) due to lack of legal counsel. A second set of trials was then held in Decatur, Alabama. In spite of lack of evidence, the jury convicted Patterson to death in the electric chair. Judge James Edwin Horton overturned the verdict, and a third trial was held in 1933. The third trial also resulted in a death penalty verdict. No African Americans were present in any of the juries, nor were any ever considered for jury duty in Alabama. This decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, on the basis that the absence of African Americans from the jury pool denied the defendants due process. The Supreme Court agreed, and the convictions were overturned. In 1936, the defendants were tried, some for the fourth time, again for rape. In this trial, the verdicts were again guilty, but sentences were long prison terms, rather than the death penalty. Notes and references * External links  * Norris v.

The parson who has been brought in to marry them, however, is in fact Vainlove's friend Belmour, who has assumed the disguise for the purpose of an intrigue with Laetitia, the young wife of an uxorious old banker, Fondlewife; and Heartwell is relieved to discover that the marriage was a pretence.A.G.

Brown. The work develops themes explored by Brown in his previous book, Life Against Death (1959). The book was first published in the United States by Random House.  Summary  Brown describes Love's Body as a continuation of his project in his previous work, Life Against Death (1959), noting that its themes were foreshadowed by the last chapter of that work, \\"The Resurrection of the Body\\". In Love's Body, Brown discusses the work of Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, in relation to philosophy and the theory of the social contract. He compares Freud's views in Moses and Monotheism (1939) to those of the philosopher Sir Robert Filmer in Patriarcha (1680), arguing that Freud and Filmer both identified \\"patriarchy and monarchy, political and paternal power.\\" He also discusses the philosopher John Locke.  Publication history  Love's Body was first published in 1966 by Random House. The book was republished in 1990 by the University of California Press.  Reception  Love's Body was criticized by the philosopher Herbert Marcuse in the February 1967 issue of Commentary. Marcuse criticized Brown's use of religious symbolism, arguing that while Brown tried to give it a sexual significance, it resulted in the \\"spiritualization of sexuality\\" and the reduction of sexuality to something symbolic. Brown's reply to Marcuse appeared in the March 1967 issue of Commentary. The author Sam Keen noted that Love's Body is very different in approach and style from Life Against Death, in that it abandoned \\"rational arguments\\" for \\"aphorism, poetry, and free association\\". Brown commented that while writing Love's Body, he felt an obligation to \\"undo what I had done in Life Against Death\\" and to \\"release any followers I had acquired or at least to confuse them\\". The historian Paul Robinson maintained that Love's Body reveals that psychoanalysis was only a stage in Brown's development toward religious mysticism. He observed that while the book contains \\"a racy (and confusing) display of sexual rhetoric\\", its erotic language is \\"largely metaphorical\\". He argued that Love's Body made explicit the \\"antipolitical assumptions\\" implicit in Life Against Death.

He was born in Christiania as a son of judge Edvard Omsen Heiberg (1829‚Äì1884) and Minna Rode (1836‚Äì1917). He was a brother of Gunnar and Jakob Vilhelm Rode Heiberg, as well as a first cousin of Eivind and Gustav Adolf Lammers Heiberg and a first cousin once removed of Bernt, Axel and Edvard Heiberg, and uncle of Hans Heiberg. He took the examen artium in 1879 and enrolled in medicine studies. After leading a social life among the \\"Kristiania boh√™me\\", being engaged to Bokken Lasson for some years, he graduated with the cand.med. degree in 1893. He tried his luck as a general practitioner in Aalesund, but quit after three years. He was hired as a physician in Congo Free State (from 1908: Belgian Congo) in 1897, and remained here until 1920, except for a study leave at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) in 1902‚Äì03. He assisted an LSTM team that arrived in the Congo Free State on 23 September 1903 to assess public health, and sleeping sickness (African trypanosomiasis) in particular. The members were Cuthbert Christy, Joseph Everett Dutton and John Lancelot Todd. The team spent nine months in the Lower Congo, then on 30 June 1904 began investigating upstream as far as Kasongo. In Congo, he lived in Lado and Ibembo before moving to Boma when promoted to M√©dicin en chef (director of medicine) in 1911. Among his professional endeavors was to fight the \\"sleeping sickness\\", but he also believed a certain degree of corporal punishment of the natives to be necessary as a part of disciplining and civilizing.

Brentano's best known book, it established his reputation as a philosopher, helped to establish psychology as a scientific discipline, and influenced Husserlian phenomenology, analytic philosophy, gestalt psychology, and the philosopher Alexius Meinong's theory of objects. It has been called Brentano's greatest work, and compared to the physician Wilhelm Wundt's Grundz√ºge der physiologischen Psychologie and the Project for a Scientific Psychology of Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. Summary Discussing the philosopher Eduard von Hartmann's Philosophy of the Unconscious (1869), Brentano comments that Hartmann \\"uses the term 'consciousness' to refer to something different from what we do. He defines consciousness as 'the emancipation of the idea from the will...and the opposition of the will to this emancipation,' and as 'the bewilderment of the will over the existence of the idea, which existence the will does not want but which, nevertheless, is sensibly present.' Brentano suggests that Hartmann's definition of consciousness perhaps refers to \\"something purely imaginary\\", and certainly does not agree with Brentano's definition. Background and publication history Brentano was at work on Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint in 1873, while travelling in Europe after leaving the Roman Catholic Church and resigning from his position at the University of W√ºrzburg. He completed the first two books of the work in March 1874. Brentano originally intended to produce a large work consisting of six books, the first five of which would cover psychology as a science, mental phenomena in general, and their three basic classes, while the sixth would deal with the mind-body problem, the soul, and immortality. However, Brentano was ill with smallpox after publishing the first two books. The work remained incomplete. In 1911, Brentano published book two of Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint under the new title Von der Klassifikation der psychischen Ph√§nomene, with the addition of remarks explaining his later views, where they differed from those he held in 1874. Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint was first published as Psychologie vom empirischen Standpunkte, but subsequent editions were published as Psychologie vom empirischen Standpunkt, which is the more commonly cited name. The first edition was designated Volume 1, but this was also abandoned in later editions. In 1924, after Brentano's death, the book was published in a new edition, which included explanatory notes by the philosopher Oskar Kraus. Reception Psychology from an Empirical Stanpoint is Brentano's best-known book, and much has been written about its \\"intentionality passage\\". Brentano reintroduced the concept of intentionality into the philosophy of mind. However, the philosopher Roger Scruton describes the intentionality passage of Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint as both obscure and hesitant. Scruton believes that the obscurity of the passage is \\"compounded by Brentano's description of intentionality as the mark which distinguishes mental phenomena from physical phenomena, the latter being described, not as objective features of the natural world, but as appearances.\\" According to Scruton, while in later editions of Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint Brentano described intentionality as a property of mental activity, and characterized it as a kind of \\"mental reference\\", Brentano never makes clear precisely what kind of property he believes it to be anywhere in his writings. Scruton has commented that none of the volumes of Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint \\"fulfil the promise made in the book's title\\", adding that Brentano eventually came to doubt that an empirical science of the mental is likely to be invented. Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint has been compared to Sigmund Freud's early metapsychology, especially as expressed in his Project for a Scientific Psychology. The psychologist Paul Vitz, who calls Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint Brentano's greatest work, notes that while Brentano rejected the unconscious, \\"his answer followed largely from his definitions of consciousness and unconsciousness, and the evidence subsequently available to Freud did not, of course, figure in Brentano's thought.\\" The philosopher Clark Glymour writes that Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint \\"gave Freud one vision of what psychology should seek to know, and of what methods it should use.\\" According to Glymour, Brentano believed that \\"psychology should have exact laws, and that the goal of psychology should be to find such laws...Brentano held that there are exact laws that refer only to the mental, and do not need to appeal to physical circumstances.\\" In Glymour's view, while Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint \\"contains lively criticism\\", Brentano nevertheless \\"had no laws of any interest to propose\\" and when Brentano tries to produce results from his method \\"the product is deadly dull and nearly vacuous.\\" Glymour considers Brentano's efforts \\"lame\\" in comparison to the work of the physician Carl Wernicke, who produced a new analysis of the capacity for language. The philosopher Barry Smith writes that Brentano's thesis about intentionality has \\"proved to be one of the most influential in all of contemporary philosophy. It gave rise to Husserlian phenomenology, but it also lies at the root of much of the thinking of analytic philosophers on meaning and reference and on the relations of language and mind. In addition, the notion of intentionality, and Brentano's use of this notion as a criterion for the demarcation of the psychological realm, pervades much contemporary philosophizing within the realm of cognitive science.\\" According to the philosopher Peter Simons, Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint \\"forged Franz Brentano's reputation and it remains his most important and influential single work...it helped to establish psychology as a scientific discipline in its own right. Through Brentano's illustrious circle of students it exerted a wide influence on philosophy and psychology, especially in Austria, Germany, Poland, and Italy.\\" Simons compares the influence of Brentano's work to that of Wilhelm Wundt's Grundz√ºge der physiologischen Psychologie, also published in 1874. Simons lists gestalt psychology and Alexius Meinong's theory of objects as additional developments related to Brentano's work, noting that \\"The course of the Psychology's influence has yet to be fully run.\\" Simons comments that Kraus's notes on Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint \\"are frequently shrill and intrusive.\\" Simons writes that while passages in chapter one \\"clearly accord mental phenomena an epistemological advantage over physical phenomena\\", Kraus \\"cannot forbear intervening several times to explain how Brentano expresses himself misleadingly, how this conflicts with other things he says elsewhere, and so on.\\" Simons believes that the purpose of Kraus's notes is to harmonize Brentano's views in Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint with views he adopted subsequently.

Alabama, 294 U.S. 587 (1935), was one of the cases decided by the United States Supreme Court that arose out of the trial of the Scottsboro Boys. This was a case in which nine African-American teenagers were accused of raping two white women in 1931. The Scottsboro Trial Jury had no African- American members. Several cases were brought to the Supreme Court to debate the constitutionality of all-white juries. Norris v. Alabama centered around Clarence Norris, one of the Scottsboro Boys, and his claim that the jury selection had systematically excluded black members due to racial prejudice. On April 1, 1935, an 8‚Äì0 court decision reversed the conviction of Clarence Norris on the grounds that evidence proved that African-Americans were unlawfully excluded from the jury. The lack of dissent characterizes the shift of national opinion on the ideas of race within the criminal justice system. The court opinion states that though Alabama had no direct laws prohibiting African-American involvement in juries, its practices essentially accomplished such. The Supreme Court held that the systematic exclusion of African Americans from jury service violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case was a significant advance in the Supreme Court's criminal procedure jurisprudence. Building on the existing precedent of Strauder v. West Virginia (1880) and Neal v. Delaware (1882), the Supreme Court addressed an Alabama statute that was facially neutral, but held that a criminal defendant could establish a prima facie (that is, accepted as true unless proven otherwise) claim of discrimination by showing that a substantial number of African Americans live in a community and that African Americans have been excluded from serving on juries. The prima facie evidence in this case was the disproportionality in the number of African-Americans who lived in the county compared to the number of African-Americans represented on juries. Clarence Norris, though sentenced to death twice, died of old age in the year 1989. He was paroled in 1943 and pardoned by the Alabama Governor George Wallace in 1976. He spent 15 years in prison and 30 years as a fugitive running from his parole. During this period as a runaway, Norris worked in New York as a warehouse employee. He was forced to change his name upon arrival because the stigma of being a Scottsboro Boy was too difficult to live with. Also during his time in New York, Norris unsuccessfully fought for $10,000 in reparations for the injustices against him. Though each of the Scottsboro Boys but the youngest received the death penalty, none of them was actually executed. Clarence Norris was the last survivor out of the group of nine. The ultimate impact of the Norris v. Alabama case is its direct effect on how racial discrimination is viewed constitutionally. Prior to this judgment, all- white juries were commonplace and not considered unconstitutional. This Supreme Court opinion made racial diversity and proportionality an expectation in the courtroom. It relied upon the principles of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, the Equal Protection Clause, which states that the law should protect every American in an equal manner.

The church began construction in 1848 and finished ten years later in 1958. It is located on a small parcel heavily planted with trees and flowers in the plantation town of Waihee. The church was established for Waihee's missionary congregation. Johnathan S. Green first established the church by building a thatch and pole meeting house on the present site in 1803. Early records indicated that between 100 and 300 Hawaiians attended the early meetings. The church is significant for its architecture. It was built with lava rock and has a limestone foundation and wooden siding. A wooden bell tower originally topped the building; however, it was removed in 1987 due to termite and storm damage. In 1930, the church was devastated by a flash flood cascading from the mountains at the back of the church property. It is still standing today but most of the church records were destroyed. Waihee Church is a historic landmark and museum. The church became an official branch of the Kaahumanu Church in Wailuku in 1868. . Over a hundred years later the church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.

He was an accomplished carver including working on the Hinerupe meeting house (Wharenui) at Te Araroa. While Turei embraced Christianity, he acquired an understanding of old Maori religion and traditional learning from Pita Kapiti, a tohunga, at Te Tapere-Nui-ƒÅ-Whatonga. He spent his childhood at Te Kautuku near Rangitukia near the mouth of the Waiapu River. By 1839, a school was opened at Rangitukia, which Tueri is believed to have attended. He later attended the Waerenga-ƒÅ-hika school at the mission of the Church Missionary Society (CMS), which had been established by the Rev. William Williams in the Gisborne area. T≈´eri attended the first synod of the Diocese of Waiapu at Waerenga-ƒÅ-hika on 3 December 1861. He undertook theological study at St. Stephen's College in Auckland. He was appointed a deacon on 25 September 1864 and appointed as the first minita (minister) at Waiap≈´ Pariha (parish), which was the third Anglican parish established by the Ngati Porou. Hikurangi Pariha was established by the chief Ropata Wahawaha and Reverend Raniera Kawhia in 1860 and Tokomaru Pariha was established by the chief Henare Potae and Reverend Matiaha Pahewa in 1863. In 1865 there were fourteen clergymen - six European and eight MƒÅori - in the Diocese of Waiapu. The MƒÅori were: at Tokomaru, Matiaha Pahewa; at Wairoa, Tamihana Huata; at Turanga, Hare Tawhaa; at Waiapu, Rota Waitoa, Raniera Kawhia and Mohi Turei; at Table Cape, Watene Moeka; at Maketu, Ihaia Te Ahu. The Waiapu Maori Church, representing the district from Hicks Bay to Table Cape (Kahutara Point), MƒÅhia Peninsula, met at Turanganui on 30 October 1870. There were eight clergymen present, seven of whom were MƒÅori, as well as MƒÅori laymen. William Williams, who had been appointed the Bishop of Waiap≈´, ordained T≈´rei, and Hare Tawhaa of Turanganui, as priests, and Wi Paraire of Hicks Bay and Hone Pohutu, as deacons. T≈´rei opposed the Pai MƒÅrire movement (commonly known as Hauhau) when its missionaries were active on the East Coast by 1865. T≈´rei accompanied the Ngati Porou warriors who defeated the Hauhau forces at Waerenga-ƒÅ-hika in November 1865. On 13 July 1897, T≈´rei together with Matiaha Pahewa, Eruera Kawhia and Piripi Awarau, assisted the Rev. H. Williams in conducting the burial service for Ropata Wahawaha, who had fought the Hauhau. In 1904 T≈´rei was appointed the first vicar of Waiap≈´. He supervised the building of the second St John's Church, to replace the church that was burnt by the Hauhau. He was the minister at Rangitukia until 1909, when he retired as he had become bed-ridden with paralysis.

Early life  Turbott was born in Auckland on 5 August 1899, moving to Hamilton as a child where he attended Hamilton Boys High School. He was dux of the school and went on to study medicine at the University of Otago, qualifying in 1923 after topping the class in midwifery.  Career  Turbott's first job was as a house surgeon at Waikato Hospital; he intended to become a surgeon. In 1923 he was persuaded that experience in India and China would be valuable and he went to work in a hospital near Canton (Guangzhou). While in China he spent three months researching hookworm for the Rockefeller Foundation, followed by a course in radiology in Beijing (Peking). By the time he returned to New Zealand he had decided on a career in public health but as graduates from Britain were preferred in the field he returned to Dunedin to lecture in bacteriology and to complete a diploma in public health. In 1927 he became assistant medical officer of health (MoH) in Auckland. He was able to initiate a diphtheria immunisation programme for school children to quell an epidemic. Later in 1927 he was appointed MoH in Gisborne. This was interrupted by a period in 1928 when he was in Western Samoa with the expeditionary force to quell the Mau uprising. As MoH in Gisborne Turbott recognised the problems causing Maori ill health: infectious diseases, poor housing, and inadequate water supplies and waste disposal. In 1933 he worked on tuberculosis in Maori on a fellowship from the British Medical Research Council. The community was resistant to the project so Turbott sought the assistance of Sir Apirana Ngata who was Minister of Maori Affairs. Turbott was able to instigate isolation shelters for the home treatment of tuberculosis patients. From 1935‚Äì1936 Turbott was chief medical officer in Western Samoa where there was a need to tackle tropical diseases and infant welfare. Returning to Auckland in 1936 he became MoH in South Auckland. There was high Maori mortality and diphtheria, typhoid and tuberculosis were rife. In 1940 Turbott's campaign for public health, particularly better sanitation, was recognised by the prime minister Peter Fraser and government allocated 40,000 for the construction of privies and water tanks. This initiative was supported by Princess Te Puea. In 1940 Turbott took up the position of director of school hygiene in the Department of Health where he promoted the public health nursing service. In 1947 he became deputy director general of health (public health) and director general of health in 1959. His appointment to director general was marred by an appeal by Dr AWS Thompson who then sued Turbott for damages because of comments Turbott made during the appeal process.  Radio doctor  Turbott became the radio doctor from 1943 to 1984 broadcasting a seven-minute talk on health every week, taking on the position from Colin Scrimgeour. The radio doctor talks were viewed with some suspicion by his colleagues but later grudgingly accepted.  Other activities  Turbott was president of the World Health Organisation from 1960‚Äì1961 and chairman from 1964‚Äì1965. He served on the Wellington Hospital Board from 1968‚Äì1983. He also served on other organisations: the local drainage board, the Traffic Institute and the Old People's Welfare Council. Honours In the 1959 Queen's Birthday Honours, Turbott was appointed a Companion of the Imperial Service Order. Personal life He married his first wife Eveline Arthur in 1923. After their divorce he married Robinetta Jamieson in 1938. He had one daughter and two sons one of whom was Harry Turbott, a New Zealand architect. Turbott died on 16 March 1988 in the Hutt Hospital, Lower Hutt.  Publications      * References  Further reading  Dow, Derek. (2003). The long locum: health propaganda in New Zealand.

It is not included in the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) or the upcoming ICD-11. Simple-type schizophrenia is characterized by negative (\\"deficit\\") symptoms, such as avolition, apathy, anhedonia, reduced affect display, lack of initiative, lack of motivation, low activity; with absence of hallucinations or delusions of any kind. Simple schizophrenia was included as a proposed diagnosis for further study in the appendix of the former DSM-IV. Signs and symptoms It has possibly the earliest onset compared to all other schizophrenias, considered to begin in some within childhood. Symptoms of schizophrenia simplex include an absence of will, impoverished thinking and flattening of affect. There is a gradual deterioration of functioning with increased amotivation and reduced socialization.Description of Simple Schizophrenia in DSM-IV-TR, provided by Brown University. p.5-6. It is considered to be rarely diagnosed and is a schizophrenia without psychotic symptoms. In a study of patients in a Massachusetts hospital, persons suffering with simple schizophrenia were found to make attempts at reality fulfillment with respect to the more primitive needs; tending toward the achievement of fulfillment of these needs rather than engaging in fantasy as is typically found as a reaction to environmental stimuli by the psychotic person. Causes A progressive state of simple dementia results often in cases of adolescent onset juvenile general paresis. Paresis is caused by placental-foetal transfer of infection and results in intellectual (mental) subnormality. Occurrence of this type of paresis is altogether uncommon (Lishman 1998). Diagnosis Classification  ICD  The WHO first listed the condition in the 6th revision of the International Classification of Diseases ICD-6 (1949) and it stayed in the manual until the present version ICD-10.Donata Lukosiute (2016). \\"The diagnostic challenge of simple schizophrenia: a case report.\\" AND PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY biologinƒó psichiatrija ir psichofarmakologija: 22. = ICD-9 = The ICD-9 simple-type schizophrenia description: = ICD-10 = These are the current criteria: The ICD is currently in revision 10, and the ICD-11 was accepted in May 2019 will come into effect in 2022. In the ICD-11, there is no longer a diagnostic category of simple schizophrenia, and all subtypes of schizophrenia have been eliminated.ICD-11 Beta Draft (February 2017)  DSM  Simple-type schizophrenia also appeared in the first two editions of the DSM as an official diagnosis: But after that, it was omitted in later versions and has since then never returned as a formal diagnosis in any DSM. However, DSM-IV (1994) and DSM-IV-TR (2000) included Simple Schizophrenia in the appendix under the proposed category of simple deteriorative disorder. The provisional research criteria for it were: Treatment The use of antipsychotic medication is commonly the first line of treatment; however, the effectiveness after treatment is in question. L-DOPA is effective against reduced affect display and emotional withdrawal, aloofness from society, apathy. History  The early idea that a person with schizophrenia might present solely with symptoms and indications of deterioration (i.e. presenting with no accessory symptoms Health.am (2009): Early schizophrenia concepts.James E. Maddux, Barbara A. Winstead Psychopathology: foundations for a contemporary understanding Routledge, 2005 Retrieved 2012-02-06) was identified as dementia simplex. ICD-10 specifies the continuation of symptoms for a period of two years in the diagnosis of simple schizophrenia. This is because of disagreement on the classification validity of the sub-type, that having been retained by the ICD classification, has been omitted from DSM classifications.Armenian Medical Network - subtypes-of-schizophrenia Retrieved 2012-01-31 [content is found under heading Course and sub-types of schizophrenia] Symptoms identified earlier to dementia simplex are now DSM- attributed by way of improvements in diagnostic technique to other classifications such as neurodegenerative disorders.Daniel R.

Bailli√®re, 1838. (original from the Complutense University of Madrid) In 1860, B√©n√©dict Morel introduced the term dementia pr√©coce and Langdon Down provided in 1887 the most complete description to that date of the clinical manifestation that Charpentier described in 1890 as dementia pr√©coce simple des enfant normaux.Joseph Zelmanowits - A Historical Note on the Simple Dementing Form of Schizophrenia Proc R Soc Med. 1953 November; 46(11): 931‚Äì933. Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine Retrieved 2012-02-01 The description of simple schizophrenia is inter-changeable with describing symptoms as a form of dementia praecox known as simple dementing, at least in the time when the Swiss psychiatrists Otto Diem and Eugen Bleuler were studying it.J.K. Wing and N. Agrawal (ed, S. R. Hirsch. - Professor of Psychiatry Emeritus, D. R. Weinberger - Chief, Clinical Brain Disorders Branch Intramural Research Program Retrieved 2012-01-31 In 1893, Emil Kraepelin considered there were four types of schizophrenia,Ben Green 2009 - Problem- Based Psychiatry - 253 pages Radcliffe Publishing, 2009 Retrieved 2012-01-22 and was amongst the first to identify three of them (dementia hebephrenica, dementia paranoides, dementia catatonica). The simplex type was added by Eugen Bleuler to the earlier ones identified by Kraepelin in 1899 and subsequently given a basic outline in 1903 by Otto Diem publishing a monograph on dementia praecox in the simple dementing form.John Cutting, Michael Shepherd: The clinical roots of the schizophrenia concept. Article by Otto Diem, 1903. This was based on a survey of two males having had a relatively normal childhood but who then fell into patterns of living tending towards vagrancy. A description of a cerebral disorder in relation to organic factors and in the context of general paralysis of the insane only; with no reference to schizophrenia, shows a disorder with features of generalized dementia (Lishman 1998). In 1951, a film was made showing the clinical characteristics of simple-type schizophrenia.Canadian Medical Association Journal - Schizophrenia: Simple-type Deteriorated‚Äî1951; Sound; B & W; 11 minutes - Can Med Assoc J. 1959 September 15; 81(6): 499.

The diagnosis was discontinued in the DSM system, although it was recommended for reinclusion. It was subsequently confirmed as having imprecise diagnostic criteria based on collective descriptions lacking in agreement. However, in an experiment with a small sample size, five patients with a diagnosis of simple deteriorative disorder (DSM-IV) were found to have grey matter deficits, atrophy and reduced cerebral perfusion in the frontal areas. Whitwell et al. found justification to retain the classification on the basis of fulfillment of \\"dimensional\\" considerations of classification, as opposed to criticisms resulting from disagreement in considerations of classification using orientation from other categories.

The capital of the state, where the governor and state parliament is located, is in Bor town, which is situated on the Nile River at the western end of the state. Pochalla is to the extreme east of the state, located on the border with Ethiopia. Much of the County is sandwiched between two rivers, the Akobo, which forms the national boundary to the east, and the Oboth to the west. The dominant people group are the Anuak who border the Murle to the west and the Nuer to the North, both of whom are cattle keeping tribes, who have a culture of raiding to increase their cattle numbers. To the east in Ethiopia, the Anuak have had tensions with the government, so communications are weak. With the exception of a few administrators and soldiers in the barracks, the entire population of Pochalla County is made up of Anuak. The Anuak are agricultural Nilotes, closely related to the Shilluk in the north and the Acholi, Alur and Luo to the south. Their culture and language is similar to the other agricultural Nilotes, but very different from the agropastoral Nilotes, the Dinka and Nuer. The Anuak people group span the international boundary, and are recognised as being in both Ethiopia and South Sudan. According to the 2008 Census, the total population of Pochalla County was 66,201.

Of MƒÅori descent, he identified with the NgƒÅti Kahungunu and RangitƒÅne iwi. He was born in Whakatomotomo, Wairarapa, New Zealand in about 1843. From 1892, he was a member of Te Kotahitanga, the autonomous MƒÅori Parliament. One of six candidates in the for the Eastern Maori electorate, he came second to the incumbent, Wi Pere. He was one of the owners of Lake Wairarapa and took a stance supportive of the government's view of land ownership. His support was acknowledged by him being appointed captain of a volunteer force, and he was to train 18 MƒÅori as a guard of honour for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. Richard Seddon, Tunuiarangi, and his guard of honour travelled to London on the Ruahine. In conjunction with Wi Pere and James Carroll, he had secretly prepared a petition concerning the remaining land held by MƒÅori to remain in their ownership in perpetuity. Scottish MP John McAusland Denny presented the petition on Tunuiarangi's behalf to Joseph Chamberlain, and Tunuiarangi received an invitation from the Parliament of the United Kingdom to explain his concerns. The petition caused great embarrassment to the Liberal Government of New Zealand, and is regarded as one of the reasons of the government passing the Native Lands Settlement and Administration Bill 1898, the precursor to the Maori Lands Administration Act 1900. From 1912, he lived in Carterton. After a long illness, he died on 29 March 1933, and was survived by a daughter and son from the first of his three wives.

Biography Speed was born in Mecklenburg County, Virginia, on July 20, 1803, and his family moved to Caroline, New York, in 1807. Speed was educated in Caroline and became a farmer before relocating to Ithaca to become a merchant. In 1832 he married Anne Sophia Morrell, an aunt of Theodore L. Cuyler. He was active in the New York Militia in the 1820s and 1830s, and became commander of a regiment with the rank of colonel. A Whig in politics, in 1832 he was elected to the New York State Assembly, and in 1838 he was elected a trustee of the village of Ithaca as well as Town Supervisor of the town of Ithaca. In 1843 he was elected President of the village trustees. In 1840 he was a presidential elector, and cast his ballot for William Henry Harrison and John Tyler. Speed lost his mercantile fortune in the Panic of 1837 and turned to telegraphy to recover. In the 1840s he experimented with both visual and electric telegraphs.Taliferro P. Shaffner, \\"The Telegraphic Manual\\" In Ithaca he was friends with Ezra Cornell and together they became agents for Samuel Morse's partner Francis Ormand Jonathan Smith, who had become the agent for the Morse patent in the states of Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin. Smith contracted with Cornell and Speed in 1847 to build a line from Buffalo to Detroit, Chicago and Milwaukee, and Speed moved to Detroit. Speed built the section from Detroit west. He made a sub- contract with Jeptha Wade for the construction of a line from Detroit to Jackson, the first line completed west of Buffalo in the summer of 1847.Robert L. Thompson \\"Wiring A Continent\\" Princeton University Press, 1947 When the line reached Chicago it was organized at the Erie and Michigan Telegraph Company with Speed as President. Direct contact was established between Chicago and Buffalo in January, 1849. However, the line was not well constructed and revenues were initially small. Speed and Taliferro Shaffner connected the eastern and western hemispheres with a line from Greenland, Iceland and the Faroe Islands. During the American Civil War he constructed a telegraph line from Washington, D.C. to Portland, Maine. He continued to invent, and received patents for his improvements to the telegraph. In his later years he left the telegraph business and became involved in iron manufacturing.

The first of the Epsom Cluster to open on the Horton Manor estate, the Manor Hospital was developed around the existing Horton Manor House between 1896 and 1899 to the design of William C. Clifford-Smith, Architect to the London County Council. The redbrick manor house was used for the administration offices, with similarly styled buildings built for staff quarters. The storerooms, kitchens and laundry were also built from red brick, with curved gables and slate roofs. Porter's lodges were built at the entrances on Horton Lane and Christchurch Road. Initially, 700 harmless chronic female patients lived in single-storey pavilions of wood and corrugated iron radiating from the main corridor. Further pavilions were built to the north of the manor house, one of which served as a chapel. An isolation hospital was built in the southwest part of the site and an existing farm bordering Horton Lane provided work for the patients and helped the asylum to maintain self-sufficiency. In 1901 accommodation was added to the site for 100 male patients who were to provide labour for the Horton Estate's Central Pumping and Power Station. By 1909 ten permanent brick buildings had been added. Wartime use In 1916, the asylum was requisitioned by the Army Council and became the Manor War Hospital. All mental patients were transferred to other institutions and the hospital used to treat soldiers wounded in the First World War. Mental handicap hospital After West Park Hospital opened in 1921, the hospital was redesignated as a Certified Institution for Mental Defectives. The new patients continued to provide labour in the workshops making brushes, shoes, baskets and clothing and learning carpentry and sewing. In the 1930s Horton Lodge, a large Georgian era mansion on Christchurch Road, was purchased by the LCC as an annexe for the Manor and West Park Hospitals. It was renamed Hollywood Lodge, to avoid confusion with Horton Hospital. The hospital joined the National Health Service in 1948, and continued to care for moderately mentally handicapped young adults and disturbed adolescents. The hospital gained an international reputation for industrial and behavioural therapy and by 1951 it had 1417 beds. In 1971 there were 1067 beds, 25 of which were in locked wards. By this time the state of the pavilions was causing concern: despite having been built with a life expectancy of 15 years, they were still in use 70 years later. Subsequently, the Hospital was redeveloped with large single-storey redbrick bungalows units with flat roofs replacing the old huts. In 1973 the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Banstead Woods, formerly a children's hospital, became a satellite of the Hospital. The Hospital by this time had 1042 beds, including those in Hollywood Lodge, Aldingbourne House (a 60-bed unit near Chichester where patients would be sent for seaside holidays) and the Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Decline and redevelopment Following the introduction of Care in the Community, the hospital was gradually reduced in size as patients were moved into alternative accommodation: by 1990 only 454 beds remained. The hospital closed in 1996 although the garden centre and Pine Lodge, a community-based day centre for adults with learning disabilities remained open. The bungalow villas have since been demolished and replaced by a new housing estate called 'Manor Park'. The Manor House, Medical Superintendent's house, three of the service blocks and both porter's lodges have been converted to residential use.

Its products are composed of operational fleet management services. It was founded in 1963. It has more than 14% of its approximately 6,600 employees working out of the Netherlands. The company is owned by LP Group B.V., a consortium including Stichting Pensioenfonds Zorg en Welzijn, Arbejdsmarkedets Till√¶gspension, GIC Private Limited, TDR Capital and Luxinva S.A. of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.  History  Founded in the Netherlands in 1963 following a joint venture between a bank and a company providing services to drivers, LeasePlan initially specialised in the open-book management model (an actual costs management system). LeasePlan expanded internationally in the 1970s by establishing operations in Belgium, Germany, France, and Great Britain. In 1985, the banking group ABN-Amro acquired 100% of the shares in LeasePlan and founded a holding company named ABN-Amro Lease Holding. LeasePlan diversified its offer by introducing an online fleet management software package (Plan8, now called FleetReporting). Responding to the trend in market consolidation, LeasePlan acquired several companies in the years following 2000 (Dial in Great Britain, in France, and in Italy, and CSC in the United States). In 2003, the holding company of the LeasePlan Group was renamed LeasePlan Corporation. In 2004, ABN-Amro sold LeasePlan Corporation to a consortium consisting of the Volkswagen Group (50%), Olayan Group (25%), and Mubadala Development Company (25%). On 21 March 2016, an international consortium led by the Dutch Stichting Pensioenfonds Zorg en Welzijn pension fund completed its acquisition of the company. In 2017, the company announced it was exploring strategic alternatives for the business, that included a potential initial public offering.

It now serves as the Ashland City Hall, which is what most people know it as, and refer to it as. It houses the offices of city government. It was designed by the noted federal architect Willoughby J. Edbrooke, and constructed in 1892-93 under the supervision of local architect H.P. Padley. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 for its architectural significance. The building is designed in the Richardsonian Romanesque architectural style, and constructed entirely of brownstone. The building is of special historic interest, and is a contributing resource within the West Second Street Historic District, of downtown Ashland. With It is the tallest building in the Historic District, and one of the best local examples of fine architecture. The monumental three- story building features a prominent four-story tower, with a pyramidal-shaped roof. The tower no longer contains its bell, although the original bell still exists and is owned by the city, but kept in storage. The first story windows have brownstone voussoirs, and archivolt moldings. The second story windows are rectangular, and the third story windows and tower openings are arched at the top. The main entrance has a large foliated arch supported by clusters of short columns, all in the Richardsonian Romanesque style. A very old flat- roofed addition on the back (north) side is made of matching materials, and matches the exact style. This addition houses the present-day City Council meeting room. A highlight of the interior is a fine oak staircase, which leads to each floor, and up to the tower. The stairwell also has paneled wainscoting, which has been nicely restored. The building was made with locally quarried Apostle Island brownstone of excellent quality. However, there are signs of deterioration due to recent sand-blasting that occurred while the building, once a vocational school, was renovated for use as the City Hall. In the 2010s, the building was made handicap accessible, with a new ramp on the west side.

It became virtually extinct in the 20th century, but the population is recovering. It is a quite different breed from the Valdarnese, which originates in the upper Valdarno, and is white. History The Valdarno chicken takes its name from the Valdarno, the valley of the Arno river. It was in the past extensively raised in the lower part of the valley between Florence and the Tyrrhenian Sea and in the plains surrounding Pisa, in the areas of comuni such as Cerreto Guidi, Pontedera, Empoli, Poggibonsi and San Miniato. The first description of the Valdarno chicken is that given by Pochini, who recommends it above all others as suitable for both small- and large-scale rearing, for its rapid growth and the maternal instinct of the hens, but who notes that it requires space and does not adapt well to close confinement. He illustrates four colour varieties, black, white, buff, and cuckoo, and notes that the black and the white are the most common. The first breed standard was presented by Maggi at a conference in Mantua in 1905; the author believed the breed to date from before 1848 and noted the predominance of the black variety, as evidenced by the local saying \\"pollo nero, pollo vero\\", or \\"black chicken, real chicken\\". The breed was described by both Pascal and Faelli in the same year. In the following years the Valdarno then became the subject of extended and heated discussion of its authenticity, and of whether it should be considered a variety of the Livornese. Although its authenticity was eventually recognised, its numbers declined owing to competition from the White Leghorn, and despite various attempts by breeders to preserve it, continued to decline through most of the 20th century until it had virtually disappeared. Recent reconstitution and recovery of the breed was based on a small number of autochthonous birds found in the Sienese countryside, with out-crossing to Bresse and Castellana Negra. The first results were presented at Reggio Emilia in 1998, and were well received. Although numbers remain low, the Valdarno is bred to the 1905 standard, and is included in the official standard of the Federazione Italiana Associazioni Avicole, the federation of Italian poultry associations, which is the authority governing poultry breeding in Italy. Breed numbers remain low. A study published in 2007 used a figure of approximately 200 for the total breeding stock, of which approximately 50 were cocks. Characteristics The Valdarno is black, with dark green lights. The legs are a dark slate colour, and the beak is black. The skin is white. The comb is medium-large, with 5‚Äì6 points. The wattles are medium-long and red, the ear-lobes oval and porcelain white. Average weight is for cocks, for hens. The eggs are white and weigh at least 55 g. Ring size is 18 mm for cocks, 16 mm for hens.

It is owned by the Tzec Maun Foundation, a private astronomical organization. Built in 1962, and known as the Cloudcroft Electro-Optical Research Facility, it was owned by the U.S. Air Force (USAF) until 1982, and initially operated by the Air Force Avionics Laboratory (AFAL). It was used as part of a project to develop new techniques for detecting satellites with electronic imaging devices, which were eventually to replace Project Space Track's Baker-Nunn photographic system. From 1995 to 2002, he facility was known as the NASA Orbital Debris Observatory and hosted two telescopes funded and operated by NASA.  History  The site near Cloudcroft was selected by AFAL in 1961 after several months of site characterization, and construction began in 1962. First light of the Electro-Optical Surveillance Telescope (EOST) was achieved in 1964. The device was a Newtonian telescope on a three-axis mount. The azimuth-elevation-azimuth configuration simplified tracking and allowed for good imaging of objects at zenith. Aiming at poorly constrained targets was assisted by two small Naval sight guns placed in domes on opposite corners of the building. The first automated detection system, the FSR-2, was located at the site in the late 1960s in a separate building. It only operated for one year due to technical and financial reasons. AFAL continued Space Object Identification (SOI) research at Cloudcroft until 1975. At that time the facility was transferred to USAF Space and Missile Systems Organization (SAMSO). In the late 1970s the facility came under control of the Air Force Geophysical Laboratory, which contracted with Sacramento Peak Observatory to perform various research. Guest researchers also had the opportunity to use the facility. The facility was deactivated in 1982, and in the late 1980s the telescope was transferred to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Table Mountain Observatory. In 1995, NASA began using the facility, which was renamed as NASA Orbital Debris Observatory. A liquid-mirror telescope was built in the main dome, and operated from 1996 to 2001. The facility has since been disposed of by the government, and is now owned by a private astronomical organization, the Tzec Maun Foundation. , a reflecting telescope was being tested in the main dome.

They intergrade in some regions. These subspecies are sometimes called varieties. In general, this plant is a deciduous shrub growing 0.5 to 1.5 meters (20‚Äì60 inches) in height. The ssp. hendersonii is sometimes smaller at maturity. The branches are covered in prickles and there are spines up to 1.3 centimeters long at stem nodes. Flowers are solitary or borne in pairs or threes. They are white or pinkish in color. The fruit is a berry up to 1.6 centimeters wide. It is reddish, greenish, purple, or black in color. This shrub grows in many types of habitat. It is a riparian species, growing on riverbanks and riparian woodlands. It grows in boreal forest habitat, often among conifers at lower elevations. Some subspecies occur at higher elevations, such as the dwarf ssp. hendersonii, which can be found in mountain talus. This plant is an alternate host for the white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola), the vector of a pine tree disease. It is sometimes eradicated in attempts to control the rust. Small amounts of this shrub and its fruit are present in the diets of wildlife species such as grizzly bear and mule deer. Humans find it \\"more or less palatable\\". Many Native American groups collected and stored it for food. The Ojibwa cooked and ate it with sweet corn and made it into preserves, for example. The root was used medicinally.Ribes oxyacanthoides.

The battle began on 21 January 2012, after Free Syrian Army fighters changed their tactics from attack and retreat guerrilla warfare in the suburbs of Damascus to all-out assault on army units. Earlier in January, the FSA had taken the town of Zabadani, and consequently gained control over large portions of Douma. After a general offensive in the suburbs, Douma was retaken by the Syrian army at the same time as the other rebelling suburbs. In the fall of 2012, the FSA mounted an offensive and took back Douma by late October.  Background   Battle   Opposition controls Douma  According to activists in touch with Reuters, the Free Syrian Army erected barriers of sandbags in the streets of Douma and took effective control of the city on 21 January. According to both activists on the ground and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) by the end of the day the whole city had fallen under the control of the rebel army and was effectively cut off from the rest of the world. However, the Local Coordination Committees dismissed claims of the FSA having firm control of the city as there were reports by activists that security forces withdrew but may return. The next day, the Syrian Revolution General Commission (SRGC) told Al Jazeera that Syrian army troops re-entered several areas of the suburb and shelled some of them. The SRGC said that limited clashes took place between government troops and FSA fighters, and that explosions could be heard on Mesraba Bridge and Aleppo Street. The group also reported that troops used heavy machine guns to fire on homes in several areas of Douma, including Jisr Mesraba, and al-Hal market. At least one person was killed during the violence. The clashes that broke out outside Douma between security forces and defectors appeared to be a bid by government troops to recapture the town, according to the Syrian Observatory For Human Rights. A video reportedly by the FSA said that if the Syrian army stormed Douma they would fire rockets at the presidential palace and execute 5 senior officers they captured. That same day in the afternoon, a video showed FSA fighters patrolling the streets while activists inside the city reported that fighting had moved to the outskirts where the army was preparing to recapture the city by using tanks. By the end of the day, An opposition activist and a rebel fighter in Douma told Reuters by telephone the fighting had eased and the rebels held about two thirds of the city's main streets. Fighters had set up checkpoints and a funeral procession, for five civilians killed by security forces during the fighting, was passing through the town, they reported. The funeral procession attracted over 150,000 protesters, according to activists.  Government counteroffensive  On 25 January BBC reporter, Jeremy Bowen, filed an audio-report from Douma, reporting that the centre of Douma was in the hands of the opposition. In his report, Bowen spoke to protesters and to armed opposition forces manning checkpoints. The next day, the Syrian army stormed Douma, entering the city from all sides, conducting house to house raids to arrest opponents according to activists, who added that the army was meeting no resistance. However, reports varied about the opposition government forces faced in Douma and also other towns in the Damascus suburbs of Arbin, Zamalka, Jisreen, and Harasta. According to some reports, government soldiers met heavy resistance from the armed opposition, and Hussein Makhlouf, the governor of rural Damascus, was quoted by Reuters as saying that the government was planning on discussing a ceasefire with the opposition controlled suburbs as was done in Zabadani. At the police hospital in Harasta, the staff said that most of the Damascus suburbs were out of government control and that opposition fighters were targeting individuals related to the government. They also claimed that snipers had made their nest in some of the minarets. Some veiled women in government controlled parts of Harasta also claimed that the opposition fighters in the suburb did not belong to Free Syrian Army, however, given the fighting conditions it was impossible to verify either the opposition or government claims.  Government reasserts control  On 29 January, an estimated 2,000 government troops backed by tanks attempted to retake the rebellious Damascus suburbs. At least 19 people were reported killed, including fourteen civilians and five rebels during the government crackdown on the Damascus suburbs, in what locals described as \\"urban warfare.\\" On the next day, the cities of Douma, Harasta and Saqba were under siege, with government checkpoints blocking all roads into the suburbs and soldiers manning checkpoints every 300 meters in these cities. A resident of Damascus claimed that region was partly out of government control. On 2 February, it was confirmed that the Syrian Army had retaken Douma a few days earlier and that the FSA had fled. Hundreds of troops were controlling the mostly deserted streets and had, according to activists, arrested hundreds of people in Douma. In the evening, a crowd assembled outside a mosque for a funeral and vowed to continue their protest. Complete and decisive victory was achieved on 30 June when Syrian army troops entered all parts of Douma.  Aftermath  On 15 October, 6 rebels were killed, mostly in the bombardment of the rebel suburb of Harasta. 24 civilians were killed in artillery bombardments by the military, 11 of them in the suburb of Douma. Clashes were reported in Zamalka, with 3 soldiers being killed. Widespread clashes were reported the next day, on 16 October, with the towns Hamurya and al-Ghuta al-Sharqiya outside Damascus being in rebel hands with clashes in other suburbs. 12 rebels and 4 soldiers were reported killed as well as 16 civilians who mostly died at military checkpoints or through artillery bombardment. On 17 October, clashes and shelling were reported in Douma, which had been seized by the army in June, with 3 rebels and 6 soldiers being killed in the new clashes. According to activists in the al-Ghouta area, 6 civilians, including children, were shot and killed by the military. A local Government official was assassinated in Damascus city. On 18 October, a New York Times reporter visited Douma and reported that it was under rebel control once more. On 25 October, the Syrian Army fired heavy tank and rocket barrages into the Damascus suburb of Harasta following the rebel capture of two army checkpoints on the edge of that town. On 26 October, a temporary ceasefire to mark the Muslim holiday of Eid ended within hours. Fighting occurred across the country with Harasta being shelled with heavy artillery, killing at least 10. On 27 October, it was reported that 8 were killed by an airstrike on the rebel-controlled suburb of Irbeen. Airstrikes also targeted other suburbs of Damascus such as Zamalka and Harasta, meanwhile rebels took control of three army outposts on the outskirts of Douma, killing 4 soldiers.

He has been credited with integrating Fremont's economy and workforce with into the larger Silicon Valley during his tenures as mayor and a city councilman. Biography Early life Wasserman was born in Gary, Indiana, on January 12, 1934, to Morris and Alice Wasserman. He moved with his family to Los Angeles when he was three years old, and attended schools in the city. Wasserman served in the U.S. Army National Guard in 1949 when he was just 16 years old. He falsely told the army recruiter that he was 18 years old at the time of his enlistment. He was honorably discharged in 1952 after serving in the Korean War. Following his discharge, Wasserman joined the California National Guard, where he served as a military police inspector and rose to the rank of sergeant first class. Wasserman continued his education during the early 1950s. He obtained a bachelor's degree in political science and administration from California State University, Los Angeles. Wasserman also received a master's degree in public administration from the University of Southern California. Wasserman met his future wife, Linda, while working for the Montebello, California, police department. (She was also a Montebello municipal employee at the time). They married at a ceremony at the Montebello city hall in 1958 and had two children: Daniel, born in 1963, and Jill, born in 1966. Career Wasserman began his career in law enforcement when he joined the Montebello, California, Police Department as a police officer in 1953. He held positions in police departments throughout Southern California during the 1950s, 60s and 70s. Wasserman moved to San Carlos, California in 1969 to become the chief of the San Carlos Police Department. He and his family returned to Southern California in 1972 to become police chief of the Brea Police Department, which encompassed Brea and Yorba Linda. Wasserman was hired as the police chief of Fremont, California, in 1976. He remained in the position until his retirement in 1992. Former Fremont Police Captain Mike Lanam noted in 2012 that Wasserman, \\"took a fledgling department and brought it to state and national prominence.\\" Wasserman was named Law Enforcement Executive of the Year and served as president of the California Peace Officers‚Äô Association. In the 1980s, Wasserman was appointed to a national law enforcement task force by U.S. President Ronald Reagan. Wasserman launched a political career after his retirement from police work. He was first elected to the Fremont city council in 1992. During the 1990s and 2000s, Wasserman watched Fremont transition to an integral part of the Silicon Valley from a quiet, small East Bay city. By 1999, 750 high tech companies were headquartered in Fremont, including Lam Research, Cirrus Logic and Premisys Communications. Fifteen of top one hundred fastest growing companies in the San Francisco Bay Area were also located in Fremont by the same year. Wasserman and other members of the city government were credited with attracting them to Fremont. Mayor of Fremont In 2004, incumbent Mayor Gus Morrison was term limited from seeking re-election. Wasserman, a member of the city council, announced his candidacy for mayor. Wasserman won the mayoral election on November 2, 2004, with 26,763 votes, or 52.6 percent of the popular vote, defeating fellow city councilman, Bill Pease. He was inaugurated in December 2004. He was re-elected to a second, four-year term on November 4, 2008. Wasserman won the 2008 election with 42% of the vote, defeating city councilman Steve Cho, who took 32%, and former Mayor Gus Morrison, who garnered 21%. Wasserman has been credited with developing a new general plan for the city. He recruited technology corporations from Silicon Valley, as well as companies from other industries, to move into Fremont. He also spearheaded efforts to build a Bay Area Rapid Transit station in the Warm Springs District of Fremont, which under construction, as of 2012. Other major projects attributed to Wasserman included the completion of the Pacific Commons shopping center, the Niles Town Plaza, the Aqua Adventure Water Park and the Washington Grade Separation. A new skatepark, which Wasserman supported is also under construction near Fremont Central Park. In 2005, Wasserman, a Democrat, appointed Republican Dirk Lorenz to the Fremont Planning Commission, despite Lorenz's past opposition to Wasserman's mayoral candidacy. Wasserman was a strong proponent of moving the Oakland A's Major League Baseball team from Oakland to Fremont. In 2006, Wasserman and Alameda County Supervisor Scott Haggerty sent a joint letter to Oakland A's co-owner Lew Wolff asking him to move the team to a proposed stadium in Fremont, to be called Cisco Field. However, the proposal fell through in 2009 through a combination of opposition from Fremont residents and business groups, as well as the unfolding economic crisis. The proposed stadium's proximity to the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge and San Francisco Bay also drew criticism from critics. Under pressure, Wolff withdrew from the plans, which would have included the construction of a new $1.8 billion, 32,000 seat baseball stadium, on February 24, 2009. Wasserman lobbied to keep the New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc (NUMMI) from closing in 2010. However, the NUMMI factory, a joint venture between General Motors and Toyota, closed on April 1, 2010, leading to job losses. Wasserman facilitated efforts to find new owners for the plant. The city successfully recruited Tesla Motors to open a production facility, called the Tesla Factory, at the plant later in 2010. Tesla now uses a portion of the land at the Tesla Factory to manufacture the Tesla Model S, an electric vehicle sedan. The mayor helped pass a city council resolution in opposition to California Proposition 8, a state ballot initiative which banned same sex marriage, in 2008. Final years Wasserman had been hospitalized for pneumonia in 2005 and 2008. After the 2008 hospitalization, he brought an oxygen tank with him to city council meetings. Wasserman died of respiratory complications at the age of 77 on December 29, 2011, at Kaiser Hospital in Fremont. He had been in the hospital for the treatment of respiratory problems. He was survived by his wife of 53 years, Linda, and their two children, Jill and Dan. A funeral for the mayor, attended by 1,200 people, was held at the Harbor Light Church in Fremont on January 6, 2012. Dignitaries included state Sen. Ellen Corbett, law enforcement officers from throughout the region, mayors, business and political leaders, and the Alameda County Board of Supervisors. Fremont Vice Mayor Anu Natarajan became interim Mayor until the city council could name a permanent replacement.

The leader of the group was an organiser and he or she possessed no theoretical qualifications. * People supplemented their group studies by attending lectures or meetings. * Circle members had no previous theoretical qualifications, but a good deal of practical experience. * They learnt to discuss, argue, show consideration for others, accept defeat and share responsibility. * They experienced a sense of community and identity. * The knowledge they acquired could be directly related to their everyday lives. * Studies began at the initial cognitive level of the members and were guided by their needs. It became apparent that the study circles were a way of empowering and emancipating the working class, as higher education was not a possibility for them due to financial reasons and the need for the young generations to provide for the whole family as soon as they were physically able to.

The book was first published in the United States by the University of California Press. Gr√ºnbaum evaluates the status of psychoanalysis as a natural science, criticizes the method of free association and Freud's theory of dreams, and discusses the psychoanalytic theory of paranoia. He argues that Freud, in his efforts to defend psychoanalysis as a method of clinical investigation, employed an argument that Gr√ºnbaum refers to as the \\"Tally Argument\\"; according to Gr√ºnbaum, it rests on the premises that only psychoanalysis can provide patients with correct insight into the unconscious pathogens of their psychoneuroses and that such insight is necessary for successful treatment of neurotic patients. Gr√ºnbaum argues that the argument suffers from major problems. Gr√ºnbaum also criticizes the views of psychoanalysis put forward by other philosophers, including the hermeneutic interpretations propounded by J√ºrgen Habermas and Paul Ric≈ìur, as well as Karl Popper's position that psychoanalytic propositions cannot be disconfirmed and that psychoanalysis is therefore a pseudoscience. The book received positive reviews and became influential. It was seen as a turning point in the debate over psychoanalysis and was regarded by some critics of Freud as a masterpiece. Gr√ºnbaum was credited with providing the most important philosophical critique of Freud, refuting the views of Habermas, Ric≈ìur, and Popper, convincingly criticizing free association and Freud's theory of dreams, and demonstrating that the validation of Freud's hypotheses must come mainly from extra-clinical studies. Some reviewers suggested that his arguments helped to show that the psychoanalytic approach to homosexuality is flawed. However, critics described the book as poorly written, and faulted Gr√ºnbaum's discussion of the \\"Tally Argument\\", questioning whether it was ever actually employed by Freud; they also rejected or disputed Gr√ºnbaum's conclusions about the method of free association and the psychoanalytic theory of paranoia. Some commentators believed that Gr√ºnbaum devoted too much space to criticizing hermeneutic interpretations of Freud and others saw a hermeneutic understanding of psychoanalysis as having more merit than he was willing to allow. Psychoanalysts have given Gr√ºnbaum greater attention than other critics of psychoanalysis, but have criticized him for his treatment of psychoanalytic theory. Summary Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. Gr√ºnbaum criticizes Freud's theories from a philosophical standpoint. Gr√ºnbaum offers a \\"philosophical critique of the foundations of Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis\\" and reevaluates Freud's view that psychoanalysis is a natural science. He criticizes the hermeneutic interpretation of psychoanalysis propounded by the philosophers J√ºrgen Habermas, in Knowledge and Human Interests (1968), and Paul Ric≈ìur, in Freud and Philosophy (1965) and Hermeneutics and the Human Sciences (1981). He maintains that they base their arguments on a mistaken interpretation of Freud's writings, as well as on misunderstandings of the methods of natural sciences. According to Gr√ºnbaum, Freud made his claim that psychoanalysis is a natural science primarily on behalf of his clinical theory, which was concerned with personality, psychopathology, and therapy, and which Freud considered its most essential part, rather than for its metapsychology, which was admittedly speculative, and which in Freud's view could be abandoned if necessary. He maintains that Freud has been misunderstood by Habermas and Ric≈ìur as having based his claim that the clinical theory is a natural science on reduction of its hypotheses to those of the metapsychology. Gr√ºnbaum argues that Habermas's conclusions about the therapeutic effects of psychoanalytic treatment are incoherent, and incompatible with Freud's hypotheses. He maintains that Habermas, based on his own limited understanding of science, puts forward a mistaken contrast between the human sciences and sciences such as physics. He rejects Habermas's view that it is the acceptance of psychoanalytic interpretations by patients in analytic treatment that establishes their validity, and accuses him of quoting Freud out of context to help him make his case. He argues that Ric≈ìur incorrectly limits the relevance of psychoanalytic theory to verbal statements made during analytic therapy. He accuses Ric≈ìur of being motivated by the desire to protect his hermeneutic understanding of psychoanalysis from scientific examination and criticism, and maintains that his arguments rest on an untenable dichotomy between theory and observation and that he takes a reductive form of behaviorism as his model of scientific psychology. He also argues that Ric≈ìur's view that psychoanalysis provides a \\"semantics of desire\\" mistakenly equates symptoms with linguistic representations of their causes, and accuses Ric≈ìur of endorsing the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan's view that a symptom resembles \\"a language whose speech must be realized\\". He maintains that such a view is mistaken, arguing that if it were appropriate for neurotic symptoms, it would also be applicable to both psychosomatic and somatic symptoms. However, he gives Ric≈ìur some credit for later reassessing his views. He criticizes the philosopher Karl Popper's view that psychoanalytic claims in general cannot be falsified. Gr√ºnbaum argues that the psychoanalytic theory of paranoia is in principle falsifiable, since Freud's view that repressed homosexuality is a necessary cause of paranoia entails the testable claim that a decline in social sanctions against homosexuality should result in a decline in paranoia. Gr√ºnbaum also discusses the work of the philosopher Clark Glymour. The philosopher J√ºrgen Habermas. Gr√ºnbaum criticizes Habermas's hermeneutic interpretation of psychoanalysis. Gr√ºnbaum argues that Freud, in a 1917 lecture on \\"Analytic Therapy\\", advanced a defense of psychoanalysis as a method of clinical investigation that went unnoticed in scholarly literature until Gr√ºnbaum drew attention to it in papers published in 1979 and 1980. Gr√ºnbaum refers to this defense as the \\"Tally Argument\\", and maintains that Freud used it to justify the claim that durable therapeutic success guarantees that the interpretations made in the course of therapy are accurate. He summarizes its two premises as being that \\"only the psychoanalytic method of interpretation and treatment can yield or mediate to the patient correct insight into the unconscious pathogens of his psychoneurosis\\" and that the correct insight of a patient into \\"the etiology of his affliction and into the unconscious dynamics of his character\\" is \\"causally necessary for the therapeutic conquest of his neurosis.\\" According to Gr√ºnbaum, these premises together entail that there is no spontaneous remission of psychoneuroses, and that, if their cure is ever accomplished, psychoanalysis is \\"uniquely therapeutic for such disorders\\" as compared to rival therapies. Gr√ºnbaum criticizes the \\"Tally Argument\\", arguing that it suffers from major problems. Referring to the work of the psychiatrists Allan Hobson and Robert McCarley, he criticizes the theory of dreams Freud propounded in The Interpretation of Dreams (1899). He also criticizes the method of free association, the theory of Freudian slips Freud propounded in The Psychopathology of Everyday Life (1901), and Freud's metapsychology, and discusses the transference. The philosopher Karl Popper. Gr√ºnbaum criticizes Popper's claim that psychoanalytic propositions cannot be disconfirmed and that psychoanalysis is pseudoscientific. Background and publication history According to Gr√ºnbaum, his initial motivation for his critical examination of psychoanalysis came from his questioning of Karl Popper's philosophy of science: he suspected that Popper's argument that psychoanalysis is unfalsifiable misrepresents its faults. The critic Frederick Crews read the draft of The Foundations of Psychoanalysis in 1977 and helped Gr√ºnbaum to obtain a publication offer from the University of California Press. The book was first published in 1984 by the University of California Press. A paperback edition of The Foundations of Psychoanalysis followed in 1985. The book was published in German translation by Philipp Reclam in 1988, and in French translation by Presses Universitaires de France in 1996. Reception Overview The Foundations of Psychoanalysis was influential. Seen as a turning point in debates over psychoanalysis, the book is considered the most important philosophical critique of Freud. Those influenced by the book include psychoanalysts, who have given Gr√ºnbaum greater attention than other critics of psychoanalysis from outside their discipline. The book became regarded as a masterpiece by some critics of Freud. Authors who have endorsed Gr√ºnbaum's crtique of psychoanalysis, in whole or in part, include the psychologist Theodore Millon, the historian Edward Shorter, and the psychologist Morris N. Eagle. In Eagle's view, developments in psychoanalysis subsequent to Freud do not provide an answer to Gr√ºnbaum's critique of the discipline. The historians Paul Robinson and Peter Gay have both credited Gr√ºnbaum with convincingly criticizing Popper, although Robinson believed that Gr√ºnbaum too readily dismissed Popper's charge that Freud's theories cannot be falsified. Gr√ºnbaum's criticism of hermeneutic interpretations of psychoanalysis has received praise, although Gr√ºnbaum has also been criticized for devoting an excessive amount of space to criticizing such interpretations. The psychiatrist Stephen H. Richmond, who credited Gr√ºnbaum with carefully criticizing Freud, considered Gr√ºnbaum correct to stress that a valid science must employ well-designed experimental studies rather than depending on case studies. According to Richmond, the neuroscientist Eric Kandel maintained in 2005 that Gr√ºnbaum's critique of psychoanalysis had \\"stood essentially unchallenged to the present day.\\" Authors supportive of psychoanalysis have criticized The Foundations of Psychoanalysis. The psychologist Margaret Chernack Beaudoin, the philosopher Gregory A. Trotter, and the scholar of rhetoric Alan G. Gross, have criticized its treatment of Ric≈ìur. Beaudoin maintained that Gr√ºnbaum was mistaken to attribute to Ric≈ìur the view that language is primary for psychoanalysis and that symptoms should be assimilated to linguistic expressions. She also argued that Gr√ºnbaum mistakenly claimed that Ricoeur endorsed Lacan's views and quoted Freud out of context to support \\"a purely causal interpretation of Freudian theory\\". Trotter maintained that Gr√ºnbaum mistakenly denied that \\"psychical reality is sufficiently different from material reality as to warrant different epistemic standards\\", and accused him of misunderstanding Ric≈ìur. The psychiatrist Edwin R. Wallace IV criticized the work for its discussion of suggestion and understanding of analytic practice, as well as its reliance on a \\"positivistic vision of science.\\" The philosopher Jonathan Lear argued that Gr√ºnbaum's arguments about the scientific status of psychoanalysis, like most criticisms and defenses of psychoanalysis, are irrelevant. He considered Gr√ºnbaum's account of Freud tendentious. The psychoanalyst W. W. Meissner argued that Gr√ºnbaum \\"forces psychoanalytic propositions into artificial positions that do not reflect the actuality of analytic practice.\\" He suggested that Gr√ºnbaum's standard of verification was impossible not only for psychoanalysis but for \\"all forms of psychological knowledge\\". He credited Gr√ºnbaum with providing \\"informed criticism of the philosophical bases of psychoanalysis\\", but concluded that the \\"value of his argument falls short of providing a useful basis for advancing psychoanalytic knowledge and particularly for promoting the quest for pertinent standards of validation within psychoanalysis.\\" The philosopher James Hopkins argued that Gr√ºnbaum's criticism of Freud's theory of dreams is based on a misunderstanding of Freud, and that the modes of inquiry he endorses are inapplicable to motive and therefore inappropriate to assessing psychoanalysis. The philosopher Richard Wollheim criticized Gr√ºnbaum's style of writing, rejected his view that Freud employed the \\"Tally Argument\\", criticized his understanding of psychoanalytic practice, and accused him of ignoring the fact that clinical testing presupposes \\"a considerable body of extraclinical propositions.\\" Robinson considered The Foundations of Psychoanalysis rigorous, but also poorly organized and difficult to understand for those without a background in philosophy, something that in his view had limited its influence. Though he believed that Gr√ºnbaum had great knowledge of Freud's writings, he argued that Freud may never have used the \\"Tally Argument\\". He also criticized Gr√ºnbaum's discussions of The Interpretations of Dreams and The Psychopathology of Everyday Life. The philosopher Thomas Nagel argued that Gr√ºnbaum neglects \\"the distinctively inner character of psychological insight\\". The philosopher John Forrester described Gr√ºnbaum's understanding of science as ahistorical and unrealistic, and argued that Gr√ºnbaum misunderstood Freud's view of psychoanalysis. He accused Gr√ºnbaum of quoting Freud selectively to support his case, and of ignoring passages in Freud's writings that suggested a hermeneutic understanding of psychoanalysis. The psychologist Michael Billig noted that, in contrast to Gr√ºnbaum, psychologists such as Seymour Fisher, Roger P. Greenberg, and Paul Kline, \\"argue that the main elements of Freudian theory have been confirmed.\\" The psychotherapist D. Patrick Zimmerman wrote that Gr√ºnbaum's conclusions about psychoanalysis have been applied by others to psychodynamic and other forms of verbal psychotherapy. He wrote that critical responses to Gr√ºnbaum have not had the same effect on the public as criticism of Freud. He argued that while Gr√ºnbaum's arguments were \\"bolstered by a reliance upon techniques and findings extrapolated from the field of physics ... his positions were sometimes flawed by basic misunderstandings about either the methods or the conclusions of physics\\", and that Gr√ºnbaum's criticisms of psychoanalysis applied only to \\"classical Freudian\\" views and not to more recent \\"psychodynamic conceptions\\". The philosopher Paul Fusella credited Gr√ºnbaum with exposing some of the weaknesses of Habermas's and Ric≈ìur's interpretations of psychoanalysis. Though maintaining that psychoanalysis \\"remains relevant\\", he argued that the book left it unclear whether psychoanalysis would be considered pseudoscientific or an empirical science. Gr√ºnbaum has also received criticism from some authors critical of psychoanalysis. Popper, responding to a description of Gr√ºnbaum's arguments provided to him by the journalist Daniel Goleman, denied that psychoanalysis can provide testable predictions. His comments were published in Behavioral and Brain Sciences. The journal's editor questioned whether it is worthwhile to attempt to test Freud's claims, comparing it to attempting to test astrology or creationism. The psychologist Malcolm Macmillan argued that Gr√ºnbaum's critique of free association is insufficiently convincing. Crews criticized Gr√ºnbaum for focusing on Freud's clinical theory while neglecting Freud's metapsychology, and for accepting Freud's claims to \\"methodological sophistication.\\" The author Richard Webster argued that The Foundations of Psychoanalysis has been overvalued because of its abstract style of argument and has distracted attention away from issues such as Freud's character. The author Allen Esterson argued both that the \\"Tally Argument\\" is defective and also that it was not invoked by Freud. The philosopher Frank Cioffi criticized Gr√ºnbaum's treatment of Popper. The literature scholar Robert Wilcocks considered Gr√ºnbaum in some ways too favorable to Freud. He criticized Gr√ºnbaum for giving insufficient attention to Freud's use of cocaine and his treatment of Emma Eckstein. The philosopher Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen and the psychologist Sonu Shamdasani argued that Gr√ºnbaum's position that Freud was a \\"sophisticated scientific methodologist\\" who attempted to deal with the possible effects of suggestion on his patients through the \\"Tally Argument\\" is unjustified, since the argument presupposes, but does not prove, non- suggestibility. They rejected his view that Freud abandoned the seduction theory because of adverse evidence, maintaining that Freud could not have had any such evidence. Popular press reviews The Foundations of Psychoanalysis received positive reviews from Robert Hoffman in Library Journal and Crews in The New Republic, and a mixed review from the philosopher Jonathan Lieberson in The New York Review of Books. Hoffman described the book as a careful and important work. Crews credited Gr√ºnbaum with showing that clinical evidence does not support Freud's ideas, convincingly criticizing the \\"Tally Argument\\" and the method of free association, and establishing that more recent versions of psychoanalysis suffer from the same problem as Freud's version, as well as discrediting Habermas and Ric≈ìur's interpretations of psychoanalysis. He described it as an \\"epoch-making\\" work that was fair and rigorous, and wrote that it exposed psychoanalysis as a \\"speculative cult\\" and would inevitably lead to the discrediting of psychoanalytic therapy and its associated theory. However, he predicted that psychoanalysts would be slow to appreciate its importance and noted that Gr√ºnbaum's discussion of Habermas and Ric≈ìur would be difficult for many readers to understand. Lieberson described the book as \\"strangely organized\\" and \\"difficult\\" and compared it to \\"a string of scholarly articles to which vast accretions of evidence and afterthoughts have been added.\\" He suggested that The Foundations of Psychoanalysis was so much a reaction to other interpreters of Freud that it was only incidentally a book about Freud himself, noting that a third of it was devoted to criticizing the hermeneutic approach to psychoanalysis. Though convinced by Gr√ºnbaum's criticism of the hermeneutic approach to psychoanalysis, he criticized his poor writing and rejected his view that it is important to establish a criterion to distinguish between scientific and unscientific statements. He considered his criticism of Popper less important than his attempt to identify the main obstacles to finding empirical support for psychoanalysis, crediting him with carefully exposing the flaws of Freud's argument that the therapeutic success of psychoanalysis confirms the interpretations made by analysts. Academic reviews The Foundations of Psychoanalysis received positive reviews from the psychiatrist Allan Hobson in The Sciences, the psychoanalyst Carlo Strenger in The International Journal of Psychoanalysis, Eagle in Philosophy of Science, the psychologist George Butterworth in Government and Opposition, the psychiatrist Nathaniel Laor in the American Journal of Psychiatry, Wallace in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, and the philosopher Alessandro Pagnini in The Philosophical Quarterly. In Behavioral and Brain Sciences, The Foundations of Psychoanalysis received positive reviews from the bioethicist Arthur Caplan, Eagle, the philosopher Edward Erwin, the psychologist Hans Eysenck, the philosopher Owen Flanagan, Greenberg, Hobson, the psychologist Robert R. Holt, the psychologist Horst K√§chele, the psychiatrist Gerald Klerman, the philosopher Valerii Leibin, the psychologist Lester Luborsky, the psychoanalyst Judd Marmor, the psychologist Joseph Masling, Pagnini, the psychoanalyst Morton F. Reiser, the philosopher Michael Ruse, the psychoanalyst Irwin Savodnik, the psychoanalyst Howard Shevrin, the psychiatrist Anthony Storr, the philosopher Frederick Suppe, the philosopher Barbara Von Eckardt, the sociologist Murray L. Wax, and the psychologist Robert L. Woolfolk. The book received mixed reviews from the philosopher Howard Ruttenberg in Ethics, Kline in the British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, the philosopher M. A. Notturno and the psychiatrist Paul R. McHugh in Metaphilosophy, and the philosopher David Sachs in The Philosophical Review. In Behavioral and Brain Sciences, it received mixed reviews from Peter Caws, Cioffi, the psychoanalyst Marshall Edelson, the philosopher B. A. Farrell, Kline, Notturno and McHugh, George H. Pollock, the psychiatrist Donald P. Spence, the psychologist Hans Herrman Strupp, and the psychologist Paul L. Wachtel. The book received negative reviews from the sociologist Donald L. Carveth in Philosophy of the Social Sciences, Forrester, and the psychologist William R. Woodward, in Isis, and, in Behavioral and Brain Sciences, from the psychologist Matthew Hugh Erdelyi, the philosopher Arthur Fine, writing with Micky Forbes, and the psychologist Alan Gauld, writing with John Shotter. Hobson, writing in The Sciences, described The Foundations of Psychoanalysis as the most important book about \\"Freud's status as a scientist\\" and compared it to the psychologist Frank Sulloway's Freud, Biologist of the Mind (1979). He credited Gr√ºnbaum with damaging psychoanalysis by showing the failure of psychoanalysts to refute the charge that free association is contaminated by suggestion, and using detailed textual analysis to criticize The Interpretation of Dreams, and with carefully re-evaluating Popper's position on psychoanalysis. However, he predicted that The Foundations of Psychoanalysis would \\"find difficult acceptance because his arguments will be unwelcome to Freud's loyalists\\", and that many uncommitted students of psychoanalysis would \\"find Gr√ºnbaum's dense prose and leaden language too high a price for the beauty of his inexorable logic.\\" Nevertheless, he concluded that psychoanalysts should \\"welcome Gr√ºnbaum's award of tentative scientific status to psychoanalysis as a ray of hope for their embattled enterprise.\\" Strenger described the book as an impressive attempt to examine psychoanalytic theory in detail, and wrote that Gr√ºnbaum \\"displays a remarkable knowledge of psychoanalytic literature and his arguments are lucid and well documented, which allows for fruitful discussion and critique.\\" Eagle, writing in Philosophy of Science, described The Foundations of Psychoanalysis as the most careful examination of the logical and philosophical foundations of Freudian theory to date. He considered Gr√ºnbaum's assessment of psychoanalysis superior to that of Popper. He praised Gr√ºnbaum's familiarity with Freud's writings and his criticism of Freud's theory of dreams, and credited him with demonstrating that there is no good evidence for the causal role of repression in the etiology of neurosis and with providing a convincing critique of hermeneutic interpretations of psychoanalysis. He believed that Gr√ºnbaum showed that clinical data by itself is insufficient to support the main propositions of psychoanalysis, but that he did not comprehensively discredit psychoanalysis. Butterworth described Gr√ºnbaum's case that psychoanalysis can be tested as convincing. Laor described the book as \\"an admirably erudite and scholarly authoritative study\\". He credited Gr√ºnbaum with showing that Freud was aware of many of the problems with his theories. However, he criticized Gr√ºnbaum for failing to distinguish between psychoanalysts' reports and attempts at theorizing. Wallace described the book as important. He credited Gr√ºnbaum with convincingly criticizing hermeneutic interpretations of psychoanalysis. Pagnini, writing in The Philosophical Quarterly, credited Gr√ºnbaum with providing a careful analysis of the views of Habermas and Ric≈ìur, convincingly criticizing Popper's accounts of both psychoanalysis and empirical testability, and \\"convincing evidence of the falsifiability of many Freudian theories\\". He also credited Gr√ºnbaum with showing that \\"the various formulations given by Freud of his theory of repression ... are based on spurious evidence and are weakened by serious logical defects\\". He wrote that Gr√ºnbaum could be criticized for ignoring some of the most important contemporary advocates of Freudian theories, but suggested that Gr√ºnbaum's \\"arguments against psychoanalysis can be extended with very few exceptions to the theories of these authors.\\" He endorsed Gr√ºnbaum's view that Freud's main hypotheses could be validated only by extra-clinical studies, and believed that his work demonstrated the power and continued importance of analytic philosophy. However, he noted that The Foundations of Psychoanalysis was difficult to read. Caplan considered the book important but difficult. He endorsed Gr√ºnbaum's criticisms of Habermas, Ric≈ìur, and Popper. He praised Gr√ºnbaum's discussion of the \\"Tally Argument\\", arguing that it helped to show that the use of \\"extraclinical methods for verifying psychoanalysis\\" involves abandoning \\"the Freudian research strategy or program.\\" He concluded that any hypotheses that could be verified through such methods would have \\"little relation\\" to the theory of Freud and his early followers. Eagle, writing in Behavioral and Brain Sciences, described The Foundations of Psychoanalysis as a \\"major contribution\\" to understanding both psychoanalysis and human behavior generally, and praised Gr√ºnbaum's critique of hermeneutic versions of psychoanalysis. Erwin credited Gr√ºnbaum with providing \\"a serious challenge to those who believe that they have rational grounds for accepting Freudian doctrines.\\" He agreed with Gr√ºnbaum that changes in psychoanalytic theory made since Freud's work do not provide an answer to Gr√ºnbaum's critique. Eysenck praised Gr√ºnbaum's discussion of the \\"Tally Argument\\". He also complimented Gr√ºnbaum's critique of hermeneutic interpretations of psychoanalysis. Flanagan credited Gr√ºnbaum with showing that there is no reliable evidence for the claims of psychoanalysis and that its scientific merit had not been established. He believed that if psychoanalysts acknowledged its importance, Gr√ºnbaum's critique would affect how psychoanalysis is viewed, including by psychoanalysts themselves. Greenberg credited Gr√ºnbaum with presenting a detailed examination of the arguments Freud used to justify his theories. He agreed with him that it is questionable to rely on case studies to assess Freud's ideas. Hobson, writing in Behavioral and Brain Sciences, described The Foundations of Psychoanalysis as an \\"epochal work\\" and credited Gr√ºnbaum with accurately describing his ideas about the neurophysiology of dreaming, providing a convincing critique of Freud's theory of dreams, and exposing the flaws of free association. Holt credited Gr√ºnbaum with providing the most powerful and subtle philosophical evaluation of psychoanalysis and \\"the most substantial indictment of Freud as a scientist that we have yet seen.\\" However, he believed that Gr√ºnbaum exaggerated \\"the dearth of supportive evidence for Freud's theories\\" as well as the problems facing contemporary psychoanalysis and the extent to which free association was undermined by suggestion. K√§chele agreed with Gr√ºnbaum that clinical evidence could not be used to make definitive claims about the causes of neuroses. However, he believed that Gr√ºnbaum's criticism of \\"clinical wisdom\\" ignored the effectiveness of psychoanalytic theory. Klerman considered the book important. He credited Gr√ºnbaum with refuting hermeneutic interpretations of psychoanalysis, as well as with refuting Popper's views, and showing that psychoanalysts could not rely on clinical evidence to support psychoanalytic propositions. He concluded that the work showed that the scientific status of psychoanalysis had not been established. Leibin credited Gr√ºnbaum with providing a useful discussion of a range of views on psychoanalysis. He agreed with him that the views of Habermas, Ric≈ìur, and Popper are flawed. However, he argued that Freud provided multiple definitions of psychoanalysis, some of which could be understood as viewing it as a form of hermeneutics. Luborsky praised Gr√ºnbaum's openness to \\"cogent evidence\\" and agreed with him that inferences by therapists about their patients' past were questionable. Marmor credited Gr√ºnbaum with extensive knowledge of psychoanalytic literature in general and Freud's work in particular, with showing that free association, as well as other aspects of psychoanalytic theory, were scientifically unsupported, and with summarizing much evidence against the view that the success of psychoanalysis or other forms of therapy establishes the correctness of their underlying theories. However, he criticized his style of writing. He also believed that the idea that conflict played a role in the causation of psychopathology retained some validity and noted that Gr√ºnbaum failed to discuss this issue, or to explore \\"the issue of causality as a multifactorial rather than a unifactorial phenomenon\\". Masling agreed with Gr√ºnbaum that cases histories cannot serve as the sole support for psychoanalytic theory. However, he criticized Gr√ºnbaum for failing to fully discuss relevant experimental evidence. Pagnini, writing in Behavioral and Brain Sciences, agreed with Gr√ºnbaum that Freud understood psychoanalysis as a natural science and that hermeneutic interpretations of psychoanalysis are incorrect. Reiser praised Gr√ºnbaum's discussion of the \\"Tally Argument\\" and agreed with him that validation of psychoanalytic claims had to be based ultimately on extraclinical findings. Ruse called the work insightful. He endorsed Gr√ºnbaum's criticisms of Popper, and argued that he helped to show that the testing of psychoanalytic hypotheses about homosexuality was suspect. Savodnik described the book as the most important critique of psychoanalysis. Shevrin complimented Gr√ºnbaum for his \\"critique of the psychoanalytic clinical method\\", but believed the work was likely to be misunderstood as an attack on psychoanalysis rather than an attempt at suggesting how it could be given a better empirical basis. He also believed that Gr√ºnbaum went too far in his rejection of clinical method. Storr credited Gr√ºnbaum with convincingly criticizing free association, Freud's theory of dreams, and Popper, and with showing that attempts to validate psychoanalytic claims must be based on extraclinical testing. However, he believed that The Foundations of Psychoanalysis was poorly written. Suppe praised Gr√ºnbaum's discussion of the \\"Tally Argument\\", and argued that Gr√ºnbaum's critique of psychoanalysis had implications for psychoanalytic approaches to homosexuality. Von Eckardt praised Gr√ºnbaum's discussion of the \\"Tally Argument\\", but considered The Foundations of Psychoanalysis poorly written. Wax considered Gr√ºnbaum's approach objective, but believed he presented only one possible interpretation of Freud. Woolfolk credited Gr√ºnbaum with convincingly criticizing hermeneutic interpretations of psychoanalysis, but argued that he left some issues unexplored. Ruttenberg considered the book carefully argued, and wrote that Gr√ºnbaum made a brilliant case that psychoanalytic hypotheses should be tested by normal scientific procedures. However, he believed Gr√ºnbaum overstated the case against psychoanalysis. Kline, writing in the British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, credited Gr√ºnbaum with making a powerful case against the idea that repression is pathogenic for neurosis and with demonstrating that clinical data cannot support psychoanalytic theory. He also considered Gr√ºnbaum's case against hermeneutic interpretations of psychoanalysis convincing, and believed he exposed shortcomings of Popper's views. However, he maintained that Gr√ºnbaum, without justification, rejected experimental evidence held to support Freudian theory. He suggested that Gr√ºnbaum, as a philosopher, lacked the competence to evaluate such evidence. Notturno and McHugh, writing in Metaphilosophy, agreed with Gr√ºnbaum that the clinical evidence held to provide the empirical basis for psychoanalysis is weak and that the validation of Freud's main hypotheses must come mainly from extra- clinical studies, but found these points consistent with the critiques of psychoanalysis made by Popper, Habermas, and Ric≈ìur and as such unsurprising. They argued that, notwithstanding Gr√ºnbaum's critique of Popper, parts of his analysis of psychoanalysis support Popper's critique of psychoanalysis; they also argued that Gr√ºnbaum misunderstood Popper's epistemology and faulted him for neglecting Popper's The Logic of Scientific Discovery (1959) and Realism and the Aims of Science (1983). Though believing that it raised important issues, they questioned his argument that the psychoanalytic theory of paranoia is falsifiable. They also questioned his view that Popper was largely ignorant of Freud's writings and disputed his position that Freud was open to the possibility of his theories being falsified. Sachs described the book as a \\"provocative\\" work that had received respectful attention because of Gr√ºnbaum's knowledge of Freud's work and developments in psychoanalysis after Freud. Though he considered it an important criticism of psychoanalysis, he suggested that too much of it was devoted to criticizing Habermas and Ric≈ìur, that Gr√ºnbaum misunderstood some of Freud's claims, falsely attributed the \\"Tally Argument\\" to Freud, overstated the extent to which Freud's theories depended on clinical data, provided a vague discussion of suggestion and ignored some of Freud's responses to the charge that his clinical data were unreliable, and unconvincingly criticized free association. He faulted his treatment of The Interpretation of Dreams and The Psychopathology of Everyday Life, arguing that he ignored interrelations between them and some of Freud's other works. Caws believed Gr√ºnbaum exposed the inadequacies of psychoanalysis. He praised his discussion of the \\"Tally Argument\\", and endorsed Gr√ºnbaum's criticisms of Habermas. Cioffi described the book as \\"ambitious and illuminating\\", but criticized Grunbaum's view that Freud relied on the \\"Tally Argument\\". He accused Grunbaum of making selective use of Freud's writings to defend his position. Edelson considered the book sophisticated. He believed that Gr√ºnbaum's discussion of the \\"Tally Argument\\" helped to show that psychoanalysts are mistaken to rely on clinical data to make causal claims. Nevertheless, he believed that Gr√ºnbaum went too far by rejecting any use of clinical evidence by psychoanalysts to support its causal claims. While he agreed with Gr√ºnbaum's call for studies to test psychoanalytic hypotheses, he argued that Gr√ºnbaum ignored inherent problems with studies of the kind he advocated. He also faulted Gr√ºnbaum's discussions of free association and the possibility of testing the psychoanalytic theory of paranoia. Farrell agreed with Gr√ºnbaum's argument against Freud's method of clinical observation, but nevertheless found it \\"vague and obscure\\" and believed that it had \\"serious limitations\\" that would lead to its rejection by psychoanalysts. Kline, writing in Behavioral and Brain Sciences, credited Gr√ºnbaum with convincingly criticizing both Freud's clinical method and hermeneutic interpretations of psychoanalysis. However, he rejected Gr√ºnbaum's view that if the theory of repression can be invalidated, this would discredit psychoanalytic theory in general. Kline also accused Gr√ºnbaum of misunderstanding his arguments for the existence of repression, ignoring relevant evidence, and citing weak evidence. Notturno and McHugh, writing in Behavioral and Brain Sciences, endorsed Gr√ºnbaum's view that the clinical evidence used as a basis for psychoanalysis is weak and that validation of Freud's claims must be based on extraclinical studies. However, they rejected his view that psychoanalysis is falsifiable, criticized his discussion of the psychoanalytic theory of paranoia, and disputed his position that Freud was open to the possibility of his theories being falsified. Pollock believed that it was constructive for Gr√ºnbaum to criticize psychoanalysis, but that there were convincing responses to his arguments. He also argued that Gr√ºnbaum failed to sufficiently distinguish between Freud's work and psychoanalysis generally. Spence argued that Gr√ºnbaum's charge that free association is undermined by suggestion might be correct, but that the evidence necessary to draw that conclusion was unavailable. Strupp saw Gr√ºnbaum's discussion of Freud as having merit, but criticized his discussion of psychotherapy. Wachtel considered the book to be of lasting value, but criticized Gr√ºnbaum's discussions of the development of Freud's work, the psychoanalytic theory of paranoia, and the \\"Tally Argument\\". Carveth described the book as more balanced than several other critiques of Freud. However, although he considered Gr√ºnbaum correct in some of his criticisms of Habermas and Ric≈ìur, he maintained that Gr√ºnbaum failed to deal adequately with the argument that Freud may have been mistaken to view psychoanalysis as a natural science. He argued that Gr√ºnbaum's challenge to the hermeneutic approach to psychoanalysis more broadly was flawed. He also criticized his discussion of the issues involved in testing the psychoanalytic theory of paranoia. Forrester described the book as poorly written and organized. He argued that the view that Freud considered psychoanalysis only a natural science is an oversimplification and that Gr√ºnbaum misinterpreted Habermas and misrepresented Ric≈ìur. He criticized Gr√ºnbaum's discussion of the \\"Tally Argument\\", arguing that Gr√ºnbaum incorrectly maintained that Freud viewed therapeutic success as the only source of evidence for the accuracy of his theories. He also criticized his discussions of repression and free association. Woodward considered Gr√ºnbaum correct to point to \\"the need for empirical testing of psychoanalytic concepts\\". However, he accused him of presenting a \\"caricature\\" of psychoanalysis and ignored important aspects of psychoanalytic theory. He criticized Gr√ºnbaum's discussion of the \\"Tally Argument\\". Erdelyi questioned whether Freud actually employed the \\"Tally Argument\\" and maintained that neither the failure of the argument nor the existence of spontaneous remission of symptoms damaged psychoanalysis. He argued that Gr√ºnbaum failed to take fully into account developments in psychoanalysis, over-emphasized its clinical aspects, and had a questionable understanding of psychoanalytic theory. Fine and Forbes maintained that Gr√ºnbaum mistakenly claimed that Freud's causal hypotheses are unsupported by clinical data and incorrectly judged \\"individual causal hypotheses separately\\". They also faulted his discussions of suggestion and free association. Gauld and Shotter accused Gr√ºnbaum of misrepresenting them.

He published the first English language anarchist periodical in Britain and is credited, in 1913, with introducing the Edison disc into the country. Biography Seymour was born in Hayes, Bromley, on 28 January 1860. He married Clara Elizabeth Spice on 2 November 1880. Seymour first came to prominence in 1882, while living in Tunbridge Wells, Kent. Seymour was appointed the secretary of the Tunbridge Wells Secular Society and he was convicted in the summer of 1882 of blasphemy. The events leading to his prosecution involved the publication of a placard advertising a meeting of the society. In 1885, Seymour published the first English-language individualist anarchist periodical in Britain, The Anarchist. He began work on the first issue while still living in Tunbridge Wells, although it was not published until he completed his move to Islington, London. The paper was produced from 1885‚Äì1888 and was briefly co-edited by Peter Kropotkin and Charlotte Wilson, both of whom went on to form Freedom following disagreements between the three. As well as producing The Anarchist, Seymour published a wide range of pamphlets and tracts, and he printed handbills for other groups, including the Tunbridge Wells branch of the SDF.\\"Social Democratic Federation handbill\\", 1888 image. HenryAlbertSeymour.com. The SDF pamphlet was published by the \\"International Publishing Company\\", owned by Seymour. Seymour is important in the history of British anarchism, particularly individualist anarchism a branch of anarchism which has dwindled in influence in Britain since the early 20th century. Seymour published a wide range of works on anarchist subjects. He was involved in the late 19th century radical community in London and it seems likely that Seymour printed material for many individuals and groups. Seymour was involved in many groups and causes during the latter 1900s. He was a founding member of Free Currency Propaganda and produced a pamphlet called The Monomaniacs: A Fable in Finance. Seymour took over editorship of The Adult: A Journal for the Advancement of freedom in Sexual Relationships, following the arrest of George Bedborough, the previous editor. In the early 20th century, Seymour became involved in the nascent gramophone industry. He introduced Edison's phonograph to Britain in 1913, and wrote about it in Sound Wave magazine. He wrote The Reproduction of Sound in 1917, described as \\"acknowledged as the standard work on the subject\\" in the industry at the time. He produced a gramophone called the Superphone and was responsible for many innovations in gramophone technology. Seymour was key in the development of EMG Gramophones and produced parts for the early production models. In his later life Seymour became involved in the Francis Bacon Society, and was the editor of the society's journal, Baconiana. His wife died in 1934. Seymour died in Islington, on 3 February 1938, at the age of 78.

Koch was born in the town of Laichingen in the state of W√ºrttemberg. His father was a general practitioner physician who headed his own private insane asylum. Koch worked as a chemist for several years and then studied medicine in T√ºbingen from 1863 to 1867. He subsequently worked as a physician, later joining a psychiatric hospital. In 1874 he became director of the state mental hospital in Zwiefalten (W√ºrttemberg). Described as deeply rooted in a Christian faith, Koch's first works were philosophically-minded. In 1882 he published \\"Epistomological Investigations\\" (Erkenntnistheoretische Untersuchungen), and in 1885 \\"Outline of Philosophy\\" (Grundriss der Philosophie). In 1886 his \\"Reality and its Knowledge\\" (Die Wirklichkeit und ihre Erkenntnis) was an attempt to join the philosophy of Immanuel Kant with Christian theories. Koch argued that the body and soul are part of the natural material world, while the mind (geist) is the way through which freedom, but also a moral claim by God, are exercised. He felt that philosophical trends against the Christianity of a nation would lead to afflictions and dangers. Overall his philosophy has been described as homespun and quite dogmatic, especially with regard to the religious elements.  Psychiatry  From 1887, Koch focused more on clinical psychiatric issues. In 1888, he published a Short Textbook of Psychiatry (Kurzgefa√üter Leitfaden der Psychiatrie). There he introduced his concept of \\"psychopathic inferiority\\" (Psychopathische Minderwertigkeiten). Between 1891 and 1893, Koch published in three parts Die psychopathischen Minderwertigkeiten (Psychopathic Inferiorities). This work provided more detail on what he intended to be a morally non-judgemental concept of individuals with various mental dysfunctions. Such conditions might have been otherwise labeled at the time as forms of moral insanity. Psychopathic inferiority was differentiated from other forms of psychopathology such as insanity with delusions or hallucinations, or gross intellectual deficit ('idiocy'). He divided the psychopathies into congenital and acquired forms, and each of those categories into forms of increasing severity. Psychopathic \\"disposition\\" meant a recognizable mental infirmity. Psychopathic \\"defect\\" or \\"taint\\" (Belastung), meant \\"anomalies in excitability, a lack of harmony, an eccentric, contradictory self, peculiarities, primordial instinctive impulses and outbursts and something periodic in their behavior\\". Psychopathic \\"degeneration\\" meant \\"a habitual mental weakness either mainly in the intellectual or mainly in the moral realm or in both\\". The use of the term 'degeneration' was in the context of the pseudo-genetic religiously-inspired degeneration theory that was prevalent at the time. However, Koch argued that individuals with these conditions should not be punished as severely and that there should be special institutions for them. This was on the basis that, although they were not certifiably 'insane', they had diminished responsibility. Koch's comments on free will and determinism, in both his philosophical and psychiatric work, are said to be so similar to the current debate on free will and neuroscience that some passages do not even appear historical. Koch wrote an essay in 1894 entitled Die Frage nach dem geborenen Verbrecher (The question of the born criminal). He generally divided habitual criminals into the mentally healthy and the mentally abnormal, the latter being the 'psychopathic' criminal types. He suggested there could be acquired and congenital types. He speculated that there could be a weakness to be provoked into crime in certain environments, or a compelling drive towards crime. A criminal inclination, Koch thought, would always be accompanied by other mental symptoms. However, he thought it could occur in otherwise highly respectable people, as occasional aberrations, as a 'specific stimulus to crime.' Nevertheless, laymen in Germany soon used the term, or its shortened version 'inferiors', to refer to any individual who supposedly suffered from a constitutional inclination toward crime.Richard F. Wetzell (2000) Inventing the criminal: a history of German criminology, 1880-1945 Pg 50 Koch retired in 1898. Legacy In Germany, Koch's term was generally shortened to 'minderwertigkeit' (inferiors), used interchangeably with 'degenerate', and applied mainly to criminal types. After World War I psychiatrists dropped that term and used psychopathisch instead, and its derivatives Psychopathie and Psychopathen. This was actually an attempt to avoid assumptions of biological, moral or social inferiority, and instead be neutral and 'scientific'. Koch's theories had been only loosely linked to degeneration theory and so survived the declining popularity of that theory after the war. The concept of psychopathy initially referred to not just antisocial behaviors but to a wide range of issues which later were classified in the category of 'personality disorders'. The term 'constitutional psychopathic inferiority' eventually caught on in the US by the 1920s. The idea of 'constitutional' meant within the make-up of the person, within their physical or psychological nature. It was used by psychiatrists to classify, for example, 'the unfit or partially fit who furnish the recruiting material for so many of the neuroses and psychoses'. This included individuals who suffered shell shock during war, as well as those who simply didn't seem able to function in modern society, or who committed crimes. Some psychiatrists preferred the term 'psychopathic personality'.William House Constitutional Psychopathic Inferiority Cal State J Med. 1923 January; 21(1): 26‚Äì29. Around the same time, Austrian Alfred Adler was developing his idea of the inferiority complex, which became widely known. Some of the psychopathic inferiorities were later recast as abnormal personalities by Kurt Schneider, and a number of the conditions have ended up known today as personality disorders. The term psychopathy itself gained a specific and notorious meaning of a condition of amorality and anti-social or violent behaviour. Such a morally pejorative concept is said to have not been intended by Koch; he had applied the term 'psychopathic' to mean originating from an organic defect in the brain, and the term inferiority to simply refer to dysfunction. However, it was probably his concept and terminology that provided the unfortunate conglomeration of aspects of inferiority, amorality and socially harmful behavior.Milton, T. & Birket-Smith, M.

It is used to project partial information about random variables and other quantities through mathematical expressions. For instance, it computes sure bounds on the distribution of a sum, product, or more complex function, given only sure bounds on the distributions of the inputs. Such bounds are called probability boxes, and constrain cumulative probability distributions (rather than densities or mass functions). This bounding approach permits analysts to make calculations without requiring overly precise assumptions about parameter values, dependence among variables, or even distribution shape. Probability bounds analysis is essentially a combination of the methods of standard interval analysis and classical probability theory. Probability bounds analysis gives the same answer as interval analysis does when only range information is available. It also gives the same answers as Monte Carlo simulation does when information is abundant enough to precisely specify input distributions and their dependencies. Thus, it is a generalization of both interval analysis and probability theory. The diverse methods comprising probability bounds analysis provide algorithms to evaluate mathematical expressions when there is uncertainty about the input values, their dependencies, or even the form of mathematical expression itself. The calculations yield results that are guaranteed to enclose all possible distributions of the output variable if the input p-boxes were also sure to enclose their respective distributions. In some cases, a calculated p-box will also be best-possible in the sense that the bounds could be no tighter without excluding some of the possible distributions. P-boxes are usually merely bounds on possible distributions. The bounds often also enclose distributions that are not themselves possible. For instance, the set of probability distributions that could result from adding random values without the independence assumption from two (precise) distributions is generally a proper subset of all the distributions enclosed by the p-box computed for the sum. That is, there are distributions within the output p-box that could not arise under any dependence between the two input distributions. The output p-box will, however, always contain all distributions that are possible, so long as the input p-boxes were sure to enclose their respective underlying distributions. This property often suffices for use in risk analysis and other fields requiring calculations under uncertainty. History of bounding probability The idea of bounding probability has a very long tradition throughout the history of probability theory. Indeed, in 1854 George Boole used the notion of interval bounds on probability in his The Laws of Thought. Also dating from the latter half of the 19th century, the inequality attributed to Chebyshev described bounds on a distribution when only the mean and variance of the variable are known, and the related inequality attributed to Markov found bounds on a positive variable when only the mean is known. KyburgKyburg, H.E., Jr. (1999). Interval valued probabilities. SIPTA Documention on Imprecise Probability. reviewed the history of interval probabilities and traced the development of the critical ideas through the 20th century, including the important notion of incomparable probabilities favored by Keynes. Of particular note is Fr√©chet's derivation in the 1930s of bounds on calculations involving total probabilities without dependence assumptions. Bounding probabilities has continued to the present day (e.g., Walley's theory of imprecise probability.) The methods of probability bounds analysis that could be routinely used in risk assessments were developed in the 1980s. Hailperin described a computational scheme for bounding logical calculations extending the ideas of Boole. YagerYager, R.R. (1986). Arithmetic and other operations on Dempster‚ÄìShafer structures. International Journal of Man-machine Studies 25: 357‚Äì366. described the elementary procedures by which bounds on convolutions can be computed under an assumption of independence.

Since that time, formulas and algorithms for sums have been generalized and extended to differences, products, quotients and other binary and unary functions under various dependence assumptions.Williamson, R.C., and T.

Sandia National Laboratories, SAND2004-3072, Albuquerque, NM. Arithmetic expressions Arithmetic expressions involving operations such as additions, subtractions, multiplications, divisions, minima, maxima, powers, exponentials, logarithms, square roots, absolute values, etc., are commonly used in risk analyses and uncertainty modeling. Convolution is the operation of finding the probability distribution of a sum of independent random variables specified by probability distributions. We can extend the term to finding distributions of other mathematical functions (products, differences, quotients, and more complex functions) and other assumptions about the intervariable dependencies. There are convenient algorithms for computing these generalized convolutions under a variety of assumptions about the dependencies among the inputs. Mathematical details Let \\\\mathbb{D} denote the space of distribution functions on the real numbers \\\\R, i.e., : \\\\mathbb{D} = \\\\\\\\{ D D: \\\\R \\\\to [0,1], D(x) \\\\leq D(y) \\\\text{ for all } x < y \\\\\\\\}. A p-box is a quintuple :\\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\overline{F}, \\\\underline{F}, m, v, \\\\mathbf{F} \\\\right \\\\\\\\}, where \\\\overline{F}, \\\\underline{F} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{D}, m, v are real intervals, and \\\\mathbf{F} \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{D}. This quintuple denotes the set of distribution functions F \\\\in \\\\mathbf{F} \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{D} such that: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\forall x \\\\in \\\\R: \\\\qquad &\\\\overline{F}(x) \\\\leq F(x) \\\\leq \\\\underline{F}(x) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &\\\\int_\\\\R x dF(x) \\\\in m && \\\\text{expectation condition} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\int_\\\\R x^2 dF(x) - \\\\left ( \\\\int_\\\\R x dF(x) \\\\right )^2 \\\\in v && \\\\text{variance condition} \\\\end{align} If a function satisfies all the conditions above it is said to be inside the p-box. In some cases, there may be no information about the moments or distribution family other than what is encoded in the two distribution functions that constitute the edges of the p-box. Then the quintuple representing the p-box \\\\\\\\{B_1, B_2, [-\\\\infty, \\\\infty], [0, \\\\infty], \\\\mathbb{D}\\\\\\\\} can be denoted more compactly as [B1, B2]. This notation harkens to that of intervals on the real line, except that the endpoints are distributions rather than points. The notation X \\\\sim F denotes the fact that X \\\\in \\\\R is a random variable governed by the distribution function F, that is, :\\\\begin{cases} F: \\\\R \\\\to [0,1] \\\\\\\\\\\\ x \\\\mapsto \\\\Pr (X \\\\leq x) \\\\end{cases} Let us generalize the tilde notation for use with p-boxes. We will write X ~ B to mean that X is a random variable whose distribution function is unknown except that it is inside B. Thus, X ~ F ‚àà B can be contracted to X ~ B without mentioning the distribution function explicitly. If X and Y are independent random variables with distributions F and G respectively, then X + Y = Z ~ H given by :H(z) = \\\\int_{z=x+y} F(x) G(y) dz = \\\\int_{\\\\R} F(x) G(z-x) dx = F * G. This operation is called a convolution on F and G. The analogous operation on p-boxes is straightforward for sums. Suppose :X \\\\sim A = [A_1, A_2], \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad Y \\\\sim B = [B_1, B_2]. If X and Y are stochastically independent, then the distribution of Z = X + Y is inside the p-box : \\\\left [A_1 * B_1, A_2 * B_2 \\\\right ]. Finding bounds on the distribution of sums Z = X + Y without making any assumption about the dependence between X and Y is actually easier than the problem assuming independence. Makarov showed that :Z \\\\sim \\\\left [ \\\\sup_{z=x+y} \\\\max ( F(x) +G(y) -1, 0), \\\\inf_{z=x+y} \\\\min (F(x)+G(y), 1) \\\\right ] These bounds are implied by the Fr√©chet‚ÄìHoeffding copula bounds. The problem can also be solved using the methods of mathematical programming. The convolution under the intermediate assumption that X and Y have positive dependence is likewise easy to compute, as is the convolution under the extreme assumptions of perfect positive or perfect negative dependency between X and Y. Generalized convolutions for other operations such as subtraction, multiplication, division, etc., can be derived using transformations. For instance, p-box subtraction A ‚àí B can be defined as A + (‚àíB), where the negative of a p-box B = [B1, B2] is [B2(‚àíx), B1(‚àíx)]. Logical expressions Logical or Boolean expressions involving conjunctions (AND operations), disjunctions (OR operations), exclusive disjunctions, equivalences, conditionals, etc. arise in the analysis of fault trees and event trees common in risk assessments. If the probabilities of events are characterized by intervals, as suggested by Boole and Keynes among others, these binary operations are straightforward to evaluate. For example, if the probability of an event A is in the interval P(A) = a = [0.2, 0.25], and the probability of the event B is in P(B) = b = [0.1, 0.3], then the probability of the conjunction is surely in the interval : P(A & B) = a √ó b :::: = [0.2, 0.25] √ó [0.1, 0.3] :::: = [0.2 √ó 0.1, 0.25 √ó 0.3] :::: = [0.02, 0.075] so long as A and B can be assumed to be independent events. If they are not independent, we can still bound the conjunction using the classical Fr√©chet inequality. In this case, we can infer at least that the probability of the joint event A & B is surely within the interval : P(A & B) = env(max(0, a+b‚àí1), min(a, b)) :::: = env(max(0, [0.2, 0.25]+[0.1, 0.3]‚àí1), min([0.2, 0.25], [0.1, 0.3])) :::: = env([max(0, 0.2+0.1‚Äì1), max(0, 0.25+0.3‚Äì1)], [min(0.2,0.1), min(0.25, 0.3)]) :::: = env([0,0], [0.1, 0.25]) :::: = [0, 0.25] where env([x1,x2], [y1,y2]) is [min(x1,y1), max(x2,y2)]. Likewise, the probability of the disjunction is surely in the interval : P(A v B) = a + b ‚àí a √ó b = 1 ‚àí (1 ‚àí a) √ó (1 ‚àí b) :::: = 1 ‚àí (1 ‚àí [0.2, 0.25]) √ó (1 ‚àí [0.1, 0.3]) :::: = 1 ‚àí [0.75, 0.8] √ó [0.7, 0.9] :::: = 1 ‚àí [0.525, 0.72] :::: = [0.28, 0.475] if A and B are independent events. If they are not independent, the Fr√©chet inequality bounds the disjunction : P(A v B) = env(max(a, b), min(1, a + b)) :::: = env(max([0.2, 0.25], [0.1, 0.3]), min(1, [0.2, 0.25] + [0.1, 0.3])) :::: = env([0.2, 0.3], [0.3, 0.55]) :::: = [0.2, 0.55]. It is also possible to compute interval bounds on the conjunction or disjunction under other assumptions about the dependence between A and B. For instance, one might assume they are positively dependent, in which case the resulting interval is not as tight as the answer assuming independence but tighter than the answer given by the Fr√©chet inequality. Comparable calculations are used for other logical functions such as negation, exclusive disjunction, etc. When the Boolean expression to be evaluated becomes complex, it may be necessary to evaluate it using the methods of mathematical programming to get best-possible bounds on the expression. A similar problem one presents in the case of probabilistic logic (see for example Gerla 1994). If the probabilities of the events are characterized by probability distributions or p-boxes rather than intervals, then analogous calculations can be done to obtain distributional or p-box results characterizing the probability of the top event. Magnitude comparisons The probability that an uncertain number represented by a p-box D is less than zero is the interval Pr(D < 0) = [ _F_ (0), FÃÖ(0)], where FÃÖ(0) is the left bound of the probability box D and _F_ (0) is its right bound, both evaluated at zero. Two uncertain numbers represented by probability boxes may then be compared for numerical magnitude with the following encodings: :A < B = Pr(A ‚àí B < 0), :A > B = Pr(B ‚àí A < 0), :A ‚â§ B = Pr(A ‚àí B ‚â§ 0), and :A ‚â• B = Pr(B ‚àí A ‚â§ 0). Thus the probability that A is less than B is the same as the probability that their difference is less than zero, and this probability can be said to be the value of the expression A < B. Like arithmetic and logical operations, these magnitude comparisons generally depend on the stochastic dependence between A and B, and the subtraction in the encoding should reflect that dependence. If their dependence is unknown, the difference can be computed without making any assumption using the Fr√©chet operation. Sampling-based computation Some analystsAlvarez, D. A., 2006.

These approaches cannot assure mathematical rigor in the result because such simulation methods are approximations, although their performance can generally be improved simply by increasing the number of replications in the simulation. Thus, unlike the analytical theorems or methods based on mathematical programming, sampling- based calculations usually cannot produce verified computations. However, sampling-based methods can be very useful in addressing a variety of problems which are computationally difficult to solve analytically or even to rigorously bound. One important example is the use of Cauchy-deviate sampling to avoid the curse of dimensionality in propagating interval uncertainty through high-dimensional problems.Trejo, R., Kreinovich, V.

Relationship to other uncertainty propagation approaches PBA belongs to a class of methods that use imprecise probabilities to simultaneously represent aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. PBA is a generalization of both interval analysis and probabilistic convolution such as is commonly implemented with Monte Carlo simulation. PBA is also closely related to robust Bayes analysis, which is sometimes called Bayesian sensitivity analysis. PBA is an alternative to second-order Monte Carlo simulation.

Construction began after a cornerstone-laying ceremony on 6 November 1890, at which the main speaker was former President of the United States and Fremont resident Rutherford B. Hayes. Architecture By the time that the sheriff's house and jail was completed in the following year, the county had paid approximately $40,000 for its new building; three stories tall, it was built of sandstone on a foundation of limestone with a slate roof and substantial wooden elements., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2012-01-21. Divided into two segments ‚Äì one for the sheriff's residence and the other for housing prisoners ‚Äì the building was designed in a combination of the Romanesque Revival and Queen Anne styles of architecture. Because of the influence of President Hayes, who was the president of an organization founded to advocate for prison reform, the new sheriff's house and jail included features to ensure that its criminal inmates would be treated appropriately. Besides providing fourteen individual cells for prisoners (eight for men and six for women), the jail's design enabled the sheriff to separate longtime criminals from those deemed to be of less danger. The design was the work of Fremont resident John Carlton Johnson, who had already established himself as a designer of public buildings; among his previous commissions were the Defiance County Courthouse in northwestern Ohio, multiple Indiana courthouses, Fremont's city hall, and several other sheriff's-house-and-jail combination buildings. The styles that he chose for his buildings varied by type, with courthouses using the Second Empire style, jails typically employing the Romanesque Revival and houses featuring mixes of Queen Anne and Italianate.Gallow, Elizabeth, and Beth Sullebarger.

It is generally associated with a public perception that crime is out of control and tends to manifest at general elections when politicians put forward hard-line policies which would remand more offenders into prison prior to sentencing and impose longer sentences. Penal populism generally reflects the disenchantment felt by a distinct segment of society ‚Äî crime victims and their representatives ‚Äî who believe they have been left out, or simply forgotten, by justice processes which focus on the offender. Origins of the term According to John Pratt, a criminologist at Victoria University, Wellington and international authority on penal populism, the original concept began in the work of Sir Anthony Bottoms a criminologist at Cambridge University. In 1995 Sir Anthony coined the term ‚Äòpopulist punitiveness‚Äô to describe one of the key influences which he saw at work on contemporary criminal justice and penal systems. It was intended to convey the notion of politicians tapping into and using for their own purposes, what he believed to be the public‚Äôs generally punitive stance towards anyone committing crime. The term changed to 'penal populism' when Julian V. Roberts of Oxford University stated that ‚Äòpenal populists allow the electoral advantage of a policy to take precedence over its penal effectiveness.‚Äù In France, this concept was popularized by Denis Salas, judge and university fellow, who defines it as a \\"sympathetic discourse towards the victims\\", which leads to a perversion of justice.By siding with the victims, Sarkozy perverts justice, Augustin Scalbert, Rue 89. Salas says that in France, penal populism has led to a plethora of new laws designed to achieve an unrealistic or utopian goal ‚Äî a society where there is no risk. He says many new criminal statutes have been passed which can be traced to their impact on public opinion, rather than their actual effectiveness at reducing crime. Theory of deterrence Underlying calls for a tougher approach on crime is a belief in the theory of deterrence - that the tougher the punishment is for a particular offence, the less likely people are to commit that particular crime. Programs such as boot camps and ‚Äúscared straight‚Äù programs provide 'tough' punishment for teenage offenders ‚Äî relying on deterrence theory. \\"Three strikes\\" policies in New Zealand and the United States are also based on the threat, and on actual, long term incarceration of offenders.Deterrence Theory, John Dilulio, p 236 Belief in the theory of deterrence also requires belief in the ability of potential offenders to make rational choices. 'Rational choice theory' argues that an individual will only be deterred against a particular course of action if they weigh up the pros and cons and realise that the severe punishment that lies in wait (combined with an assessment of the likelihood of being caught) makes the crime not worth committing. However, the evidence suggests that increasing the severity of a punishment does not have much deterrent effect on crime, while increasing the certainty of punishment does.\\"Deterrence in Criminal Justice: Evaluating Certainty vs. Severity of Punishment\\", Wright, Valerie (November 2010), The Sentencing Project. Clearly, enhancing the severity of punishment will have little impact on people who do not believe they will be apprehended for their actions. A study by Canadian criminologist Paul Gendreau brought together the results of 50 different studies of the deterrent effect of imprisonment involving over 300,000 offenders. The report said: \\"None of the analyses found imprisonment reduced recidivism. The recidivism rate for offenders who were imprisoned as opposed to given a community sanction was similar. In addition, longer sentences were not associated with reduced recidivism. In fact the opposite was found. Longer sentences were associated with a 3% increase in recidivism. This finding suggests some support for the (opposing) theory that prison may serve as a ‚Äòschool for crime‚Äô for some offenders\\".Gendreau, P, Goggin, C, Cullen FT, The effects of prison sentences on recidivism, User Report: Office of the Solicitor General, Canada, 1999, p24. The rise of victims' movement Until the 1960s, criminal justice in western democracies involved primarily only two parties, the state and the offender. The rise of victims' movements in the second half of the twentieth century thrust a new, and until now largely forgotten, player into the justice arena. Initially, victims' groups provided support and counselling services to victims of crime, while the state began providing financial compensation and restitution. As the movement became more organised, the views of victims' groups became institutionalised through a variety of mechanisms such as victim impact statements and victim involvement in parole board hearings. In the United States, notification schemes such as Megan's Law, which requires authorities to make information available to the public regarding registered sex offenders, were also part of the process.Penal Populism and Public Opinion: Lessons from Five Countries.(Book Review) Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology 1 August 2003 Groups like Citizens United for Safety and Justice in Canada, Justice For All in the United States and the Sensible Sentencing Trust in New Zealand were often strident and vociferous although their spokespeople generally represent only a minority of crime victims ‚Äî usually those in sensational murder cases.The Power of Penal Populism: Public Influences on Penal and Sentencing Policy from 1999 to 2008, Tess Bartlett, Victoria University of Wellington, June 2009, p 16. Such groups rely on populist appeals to 'common sense‚Äô rather than evidence, research and analysis ‚Äî which makes them attractive to the sensational approach increasingly adopted by the media. In New Zealand, the Sensible Sentencing Trust has had a significant impact in the media and on the political process ‚Äî although the Trust does not mention victims in its mission statement which is about protecting the 'safety for all New Zealanders from violent and criminal offending'. The Trust is headed by Garth McVicar, a farmer from Napier. Role of the media Full front pages of Japanese newspapers about the 2014 AKB48 handsaw assault The role of the media is pivotal in shaping perceptions about the level of crime in society and promoting populist causes. In Anglo-Saxon countries in particular, the tabloid media tend to focus on stories about violent crime, especially when there are lurid or unusual circumstances. In Britain, the extensive coverage given to the ten-year-old killers of James Bulger is a typical example. In New Zealand, 12-year-old Bailey Junior Kurariki received similar media attention for yearsKim Workman, Politics and Punitiveness ‚Äî Overcoming the criminal justice dilemma http://www.rethinking.org.nz/assets/Media%20and%20Crime/Politics%20and%20Punitiveness%20.pdf after his involvement in the death of Michael Choy, who was bashed to death as he delivered a pizza. Professor Pratt argues that the way in which penal populism takes hold is through an array of law and order lobby groups making use of high-profile murders like these to generate fear and push for tougher sentences. The outcome is that the tabloid press, talkback radio hosts and callers, right-wing think-tanks, victims groups and some evangelising police chiefs spread the message that the solution to crime is 'zero tolerance'. As these groups gain access in the media, they have become increasingly influential on government policy. New kinds of technology, including social media have also played a role. Increasingly information is conveyed in brief 'sound bites' so that it becomes something between information and entertainment. This makes 'the news' more susceptible to simplistic and populist explanations at the expense of more in-depth analysis and the seemingly indigestible opinions of academics and experts. Pratt argues that as a result, the influence of academics, senior civil servants, penal reform groups and judges who collectively make up the 'criminal justice establishment' has steadily declined.John Pratt, When penal populism stops: legitimacy, scandal and the power to punish in New Zealand, Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology, December 1, 2008. https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-190794149 Generating fear of crime The media enables concerned citizens to pick up images of criminal events ‚Äî the perpetrators, the victims, motives, and sensational details of violent crimes; interpersonal communication and internet based social networks add to the dissemination of information. Fear may be generated if the individual identifies with the described victim, or feels that their own neighbourhood bears resemblance to the one described; then the image of risk may be taken up, personalised and translated into personal safety concerns.Winkel, F. W. & Vrij, A. (1990). Fear of crime and mass media crime reports: Testing similarity hypotheses. International Review of Victimology, 1, 251-265. The media sometimes reports fear of crime through broader concerns about neighbourhood breakdown, the loss of moral authority, and the crumbling of civility and social capital.Lee, M. (2001). The Genesis of Fear of Crime.Theoretical Criminology (5) 4 Often there is a noticeable difference between the perceived risk of becoming a victim of crime and the statistical probability. However, hearing about events in the media or knowing others who have been victimised increases public perception of the risk of victimisation.Tyler, T. R. (1984) ‚ÄòAssessing the risk of crime victimization: The integration of personal victimization experience and socially transmitted information.‚Äô Journal of Social Issues, 40, 27-38. In some western countries, crime accounts for up to 25% of news coverage.Maguire, M. Morgan, R. and Reiner, R. (1997). Oxford Handbook of Criminology. Oxford University Press, Oxford. The formation of a ‚Äòfear of crime' feedback loop allows more citizens to be surveyed as fearful, more politicians to be able to use crime fear as a political issue, in an ever increasing spiral that crime is out of control.Lee, M. (2007). Inventing Fear of Crime: Criminology and the Politics of Anxiety. Willan, Collumpton. See Fear of crime for more information. Impact on the prison population Total incarceration in the United States by year In those countries where penal populism occurs, it generally leads to an increase in the prison population. According to Pratt, countries such as New Zealand, Great Britain and the United States have been particularly affected by penal populism.Penal Populism, John Pratt, Routledge, London and New York, 2007, p 15. Roberts reports that it has also had a significant impact in Canada and Australia.Penal Populism and public opinion ‚Äî lessons from five countries, Julian Roberts, OUP 2003: https://books.google.com/books?id=9ExuP6ve4MAC&pg;=PA3 Over the last 25 years, prison populations have increased significantly in these countries despite widespread declines in reported crime, evident in both recorded crime statistics and victim surveys. In the United States for instance, the rate of imprisonment has risen dramatically despite a National Crime Victimisation Survey in 2007 which showed that property and violent crime rates in the United States were the lowest they had been since 1973. In England and Wales, between 2006 and 2008 the prison population increased by 7% despite the British Crime Survey revealing in 2008 that crime was the lowest it had been in since 1981 when the victim survey was first published. In New Zealand the prison population went from about 60 people per 100,000 of population in 1950 to nearly 200 per 100,000 in March 2011. It escalated dramatically from 2000 onwards leading to the building of five new prisons. This happened at a time when New Zealand's crime rate was declining and number of murders committed each year halved.NZ's murder rate halved in past 20 years, NZ Herald, April 7, 2009.

Hoover quoted by Morgan. Powers, p 215.  Start of the trial  Foley Square federal courthouse in Manhattan. The 1949 trial was held in New York City at the Foley Square federal courthouse of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Judge Harold Medina, a former Columbia University professor who had been on the bench for 18 months when the hearing began, presided.Morgan, p 314. Sabin, p 41. Before becoming a judge, Medina successfully argued the case of Cramer v. United States before the Supreme Court, defending a German-American charged with treason.Cramer v. United States, 325 U.S. 1, 1945. The trial opened on November 1, 1948, and preliminary proceedings and jury selection lasted until January 17, 1949; the defendants first appeared in court on March 7, and the case concluded on October 14, 1949.Morgan, p 315. Although later trials surpassed it, in 1949 it was the longest federal trial in US history.Longer trials have been held since then, for example a 20-month trial in 1988 (Longest Mob Trial Ends, Los Angeles Times, August 27, 1988. Retrieved June 10, 2012). The trial was one of the country's most contentious legal proceedings and sometimes had a \\"circus-like atmosphere\\".Walker, p 185. Morgan, p 315. Sabin, pp 44‚Äì45. \\"Circus-like\\" are Sabin's words. Four hundred police officers were assigned to the site on the opening day of the trial.

Public opinion  The opinion of the American public and the news media was overwhelming in favor of conviction.Belknap (1994), p 217. Belknap quotes an editorial from the left-leaning The New Republic, written after the prosecution rested on May 19, 1949: \\"[the prosecution] failed to make out the overwhelming case that many people anticipated before the trial began\\". Magazines, newspapers, and radio reported on the case heavily; Time magazine featured the trial on its cover twice with stories titled \\"Communists: The Presence of Evil\\" and \\"Communists: The Little Commissar\\" (referring to Eugene Dennis). Most American newspapers supported the prosecution, such as the New York World-Telegram which reported that the Communist Party would soon be punished.Martelle, p 76. Martelle states that Shirer's statement was published in the New York Star. The New York Times, in an editorial, felt that the trial was warranted and denied assertions of the Party that the trial was a provocation comparable to the Reichstag fire. The Christian Science Monitor took a more detached view in an editorial: \\"The outcome of the case will be watched by government and political parties around the world as to how the United States, as an outstanding exponent of democratic government, intends to share the benefits of its civil liberties and yet protect them if and when they appear to be abused by enemies from within\\". Support for the prosecutions was not universal, however. During the proceedings, there were days when several thousand picketers protested in Foley Square outside the courthouse, chanting slogans like \\"Adolf Hitler never died / He's sitting at Medina's side\\". In response, the US House of Representatives passed a bill in August to outlaw picketing near federal courthouses, but the Senate did not vote on it before the end of the trial.Walker, p 186. Journalist William L. Shirer was skeptical of the trial, writing \\"no overt act of trying to forcibly overthrow our government is charged ... The government's case is simply that by being members and leaders of the Communist Party, its doctrines and tactics being what they are, the accused are guilty of conspiracy\\". The Washington Post wrote that the purpose of the government's legal attack on the CPUSA was \\"not so much the protection and security of the state as the exploitation of justice for the purpose of propaganda.\\"Belknap (1994), p 214. Washington Post quoted by Belknap. Third-party presidential candidate Henry A. Wallace claimed that the trial was an effort by the Truman administration to create an atmosphere of fear, writing \\"we Americans have far more to fear from those actions which are intended to suppress political freedom than from the teaching of ideas with which we are in disagreement.\\" Farrell Dobbs of the SWP wrotedespite the fact that the CPUSA had supported Dobbs' prosecution under the Smith Act in 1941\\"I want to state in no uncertain terms that I as well as the Socialist Workers Party support their struggle against the obnoxious Smith Act, as well as against the indictments under that act\\".; letter dated July 22, 1948 Before the trial began, supporters of the defendants decided on a campaign of letter-writing and demonstrations: the CPUSA urged its members to bombard Truman with letters requesting that the charges be dropped.Belknap (1994), p 212. Later, supporters similarly flooded Judge Medina with telegrams and letters urging him to dismiss the charges.Redish, p 82. The defense was not optimistic about the probability of success. After the trial was over, defendant Gates wrote: \\"The anti-communist hysteria was so intense, and most Americans were so frightened by the Communist issue, that we were convicted before our trial even started\\".Belknap (1994), p 208.  Prosecution  Prosecutor John McGohey did not assert that the defendants had a specific plan to violently overthrow the US government, but rather alleged that the CPUSA's philosophy generally advocated the violent overthrow of governments. The prosecution called witnesses who were either undercover informants, such as Angela Calomiris and Herbert Philbrick, or former communists who had become disenchanted with the CPUSA, such as Louis Budenz.Belknap (1994), pp 216‚Äì217. The prosecution witnesses testified about the goals and policies of the CPUSA, and they interpreted the statements of pamphlets and books (including The Communist Manifesto) and works by such authors as Karl Marx and Joseph Stalin.Belknap (1994), p 214. Belknap (1994), p 209. The prosecution argued that the texts advocated violent revolution, and that by adopting the texts as their political foundation, the defendants were guilty of advocating violent overthrow of the government. Calomiris was recruited by the FBI in 1942 and infiltrated the CPUSA, gaining access to a membership roster.Mahoney, M.H., Women in Espionage: A Biographical Dictionary, Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 1993, pp 37‚Äì39. She received a salary from the FBI during her seven years as an informant. Calomiris identified four of the defendants as members of the CPUSA and provided information about its organization.\\"Girl Official of Party Stuns Reds at Trial\\", Chicago Daily Tribune, April 27, 1949, p 21. She testified that the CPUSA espoused violent revolution against the government, and that the CPUSAacting on instructions from Moscowhad attempted to recruit members working in key war industries.Martelle, pp.148‚Äì149. Budenz, a former communist, was another important witness for the prosecution who testified that the CPUSA subscribed to a philosophy of violent overthrow of the government. He also testified that the clauses of the constitution of the CPUSA that disavowed violence were decoys written in \\"Aesopian language\\" which were put in place specifically to protect the CPUSA from prosecution.  Defense  George W. Crockett Jr., Richard Gladstein, Harry Sacher, and Louis F. McCabe. The five attorneys who volunteered to defend the communists were familiar with leftist causes and supported the defendants' rights to espouse socialist viewpoints. They were Abraham Isserman, George W. Crockett Jr., Richard Gladstein, Harry Sacher, and Louis F. McCabe.\\"Communist Trial Ends with 11 Guilty\\", Life, October 24, 1949, p 31.Sabin, p 42. Attorney Maurice Sugar participated in an advisory role. Defendant Eugene Dennis represented himself. The ACLU was dominated by anti-communist leaders during the 1940s, and did not enthusiastically support persons indicted under the Smith Act; but it did submit an amicus brief endorsing a motion for dismissal of the charges.Walker, pp 185‚Äì187. Many local affiliates of the ACLU supported second-tier communist defendants in the 1950s. The defense employed a three-pronged strategy: First, they sought to portray the CPUSA as a conventional political party, which promoted socialism by peaceful means; second, they attacked the trial as a capitalist venture which could never provide a fair outcome for proletarian defendants; and third, they used the trial as an opportunity to publicize CPUSA policies.Walker, p 185. Belknap (1994), p 217. Sabin, pp 44‚Äì46. The defense made pre-trial motions arguing that the defendants' right to trial by a jury of their peers had been denied because, at that time, a potential grand juror had to meet a minimum property requirement, effectively eliminating the less affluent from service.Belknap (1994), p 213. Walker, p 185. Starobin, p 206. Medina's ruling on the jury selection issue is 83 F.Supp. 197 (1949). The issue was addressed by the appeals court in 183 F.2d 201 (2d Cir. 1950). The defense also argued that the jury selection process for the trial was similarly flawed.Belknap (1994), p 213. Their objections to the jury selection process were not successful and jurors included four African Americans and consisted primarily of working-class citizens.Belknap (1994), p 214. A primary theme of the defense was that the CPUSA sought to convert the US to socialism by education, not by force.Belknap (1994), p 219. The defense claimed that most of the prosecution's documentary evidence came from older texts that pre- dated the 1935 Seventh World Congress of the Comintern, after which the CPUSA rejected violence as a means of change.Belknap (1994), pp 219‚Äì220. Starobin, p 207. The defense attempted to introduce documents into evidence which represented the CPUSA's advocacy of peace, claiming that these policies superseded the older texts that the prosecution had introduced which emphasized violence. Medina excluded most of the material proposed by the defense because it did not directly pertain to the specific documents the prosecution had produced. As a result, the defense complained that they were unable to portray the totality of their belief system to the jury.Belknap (1994), p 220. The defense attorneys developed a \\"labor defense\\" strategy, by which they attacked the entire trial process, including the prosecutor, the judge, and the jury selection process.Redish, pp 81‚Äì82. The strategy involved verbally disparaging the judge and the prosecutors, and may have been an attempt to provoke a mistrial.Sabin, p 46. \\"Mutual hostility\\" is Sabin's characterization. Another aspect of the labor defense was an effort to rally popular support to free the defendants, in the hope that public pressure would help achieve acquittals. Throughout the course of the trial, thousands of supporters of the defendants flooded the judge with protests, and marched outside the courthouse in Foley Square. The defense used the trial as an opportunity to educate the public about their beliefs, so they focused their defense around the political aspects of communism, rather than rebutting the legal aspects of the prosecution's evidence.Belknap (1994), p 218. Defendant Dennis chose to represent himself so he could, in his role as attorney, directly address the jury and explain communist principles.  Courtroom atmosphere  The trial was one of the country's most contentious legal proceedings and sometimes had a \\"circus-like atmosphere\\". Four hundred police officers were assigned to the site on the opening day of the trial. The defense deliberately antagonized the judge by making a large number of objections and motions, which led to numerous bitter engagements between the attorneys and Judge Medina.Redish, p 82. Sabin, p 46. Despite the aggressive defense tactics and a voluminous letter- writing campaign directed at Medina, he stated \\"I will not be intimidated\\".Belknap (1994), p 218. Medina quoted by Belknap. Out of the chaos, an atmosphere of \\"mutual hostility\\" arose between the judge and attorneys. Judge Medina attempted to maintain order by removing disorderly defendants. In the course of the trial, Medina sent five of the defendants to jail for outbursts, including Hall because he shouted \\"I've heard more law in a kangaroo court\\", and Winstonan African Americanfor shouting \\"more than five thousand Negroes have been lynched in this country\\".Sabin, pp 46‚Äì47. Sabin writes that only four defendants were cited. Morgan, p 315 (Morgan erroneously quotes Winston as saying 500the correct quote is 5,000). Martelle, p 175. Several times in July and August, the judge held defense attorneys in contempt of court, and told them their punishment would be meted out upon conclusion of the trial.Martelle, p 190. Fellow judge James L. Oakes described Medina as a fair and reasonable judge, and wrote that \\"after the judge saw what the lawyers were doing, he gave them a little bit of their own medicine, too.\\"Oakes, p 1460. Legal scholar and historian Michal Belknap writes that Medina was \\"unfriendly\\" to the defense, and that \\"there is reason to believe that Medina was biased against the defendants\\", citing a statement Medina made before the trial: \\"If we let them do that sort of thing [postpone the trial start], they'll destroy the government\\".Belknap (1994), pp 212, 220. According to Belknap, Medina's behavior towards the defense may have been exacerbated by the fact that another federal judge had died of a heart attack during the 1943 trial involving the Smith Act.Belknap (2001), p 860. Some historians speculate that Medina came to believe that the defense was deliberately trying to provoke him into committing a legal error with the goal of achieving a mistrial.  Events outside the courtroom  Paul Robeson gave a concert to raise defense funds.Martelle, p 193. During the ten-month trial, several events occurred in America that intensified the nation's anti- communist sentiment: The Judith Coplon Soviet espionage case was in progress; former government employee Alger Hiss was tried for perjury stemming from accusations that he was a communist (a trial also held at the Foley Square courthouse); labor leader Harry Bridges was accused of perjury when he denied being a communist; and the ACLU passed an anti-communist resolution.Sabin, p 45.Johnson, John W., \\"Icons of the Cold War: The Hiss‚ÄìChambers Case\\", in Historic U.S. Court Cases: An Encyclopedia (Vol 1), (John W. Johnson, Ed.), Taylor & Francis, 2001, p 79, (Hiss in same building). Two events during the final month of the trial may have been particularly influential: On September 23, 1949, Truman announced that the Soviet Union detonated its first nuclear bomb; and on October 1, 1949, the Communist Party of China prevailed in the Chinese Civil War. Defendants Irving Potash and Benjamin J. Davis were among the audience members attacked as they left a September 4 concert headlined by Paul Robeson in Peekskill, New York. It was given to benefit the Civil Rights Congress (CRC), which was funding the defendants' legal expenses. Hundreds lined the roads leaving the performance grounds and threw rocks and bottles at the departing vehicles without interference by the police.Martelle, pp 197‚Äì204. Over 140 people suffered injuries, including Potash, whose eyes were struck by glass from a broken windshield.Belknap (1977), p 105. The trial was suspended for two days while Potash recovered from his injuries.Martelle, pp 204‚Äì205.  Convictions and sentencing  Defendants' supporters, onlookers, and police outside the Foley Square courthouse during the 1949 trial:.Martelle, p 217. On October 14, 1949, after the defense rested their case, the judge gave the jury instructions to guide them in reaching a verdict. He instructed the jury that the prosecution was not required to prove that the danger of violence was \\"clear and present\\"; instead, the jury should consider if the defendants had advocated communist policy as a \\"rule or principle of action\\" with the intention of inciting overthrow by violence \\"as speedily as circumstances would permit\\". This instruction was in response to the defendants, who endorsed the \\"clear and present danger\\" test, yet that test was not adopted as law by the Supreme Court. The judge's instructions included the phrase \\"I find as a matter of law that there is sufficient danger of a substantive evil ...\\" which would later be challenged by the defense during their appeals.Sabin, p 45. Belknap (1994), p 221. Redish, p 87. One instruction from Medina to the jury was \\"I find as a matter of law that there is sufficient danger of a substantive evil that the Congress had a right to prevent, to justify the application of the statute under the First Amendment of the Constitution.\\" After deliberating for seven and one-half hours, the jury returned guilty verdicts against all eleven defendants.Belknap (1994), p 221. The judge sentenced ten defendants to five years and a $10,000 fine each ($ in dollars). The eleventh defendant, Robert G. Thompsona veteran of World War IIwas sentenced to three years in consideration of his wartime service.Morgan, p 317. Thompson said that he took \\"no pleasure that this Wall Street judicial flunky has seen fit to equate my possession of the Distinguished Service Cross to two years in prison.\\"Belknap (1994), p 221. Morgan, p 317. Thompson quoted by Morgan. Immediately after the jury rendered a verdict, Medina turned to the defense attorneys saying he had some \\"unfinished business\\" and he held them in contempt of court, and sentenced all of them to jail terms ranging from 30 days to six months; Dennis, acting as his own attorney, was also cited.Attorney Maurice Sugar, who participated in an advisory role, was not cited for contempt. Since the contempt sentences were based on behavior witnessed by the judge, no hearings were required for the contempt charges, and the attorneys were immediately handcuffed and led to jail.Sabin, p 47.The regulation governing the contempt sentences was Rule 42(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Some of the contempt sentences were postponed pending appeal; for instance, Crockett served four months in an Ashland, Kentucky, Federal prison in 1952. See Smith, Jessie Carney, Notable Black American Men, Volume 1, Gale, 1998, p 236, .  Public reaction  The vast majority of the public, and most news media, endorsed the verdict. Typical was a letter to the New York Times: \\"The Communist Party may prove to be a hydra-headed monster unless we can discover how to kill the body as well as how to cut off its heads.\\"; letter dated October 16, 1949 The day of the convictions, New York Gov. Thomas E. Dewey and Senator John Foster Dulles praised the verdicts. Some vocal supporters of the defendants spoke out in their defense. A New York resident wrote: \\"I am not afraid of communism ... I am only afraid of the trend in our country today away from the principles of democracy.\\"; letter written October 14, 1949 Another wrote: \\"the trial was a political trial ... Does not the Soviet Union inspire fear in the world at large precisely because masses of human beings have no confidence in the justice of its criminal procedures against dissidents? ... I trust that the Supreme Court will be able to correct a grave error in the operation of our political machinery by finding the ... Smith bill unconstitutional.\\"; letter written October 16, 1949 William Z. Foster wrote: \\"every democratic movement in the United States is menaced by this reactionary verdict ... The Communist Party will not be dismayed by this scandalous verdict, which belies our whole national democratic traditions. It will carry the fight to the higher courts, to the broad masses of the people.\\" Vito Marcantonio of the American Labor Party wrote that the verdict was \\"a sharp and instant challenge to the freedom of every American.\\" The ACLU issued a statement reiterating its opposition to the Smith Act, because it felt the act criminalized political advocacy. Abroad, the trial received little mention in mainstream press, but Communist newspapers were unanimous in their condemnation. The Moscow press wrote that Medina showed \\"extraordinary prejudice\\"; the London communist newspaper wrote that the defendants had been convicted only of \\"being communists\\"; and in France, a paper decried the convictions as \\"a step on the road that leads to war.\\" On October 21, President Truman appointed prosecutor John McGohey to serve as a US District Court judge.\\"McGohey, John F. X.\\", Biographical Directory of Federal Judges, Federal Judicial Center. Retrieved February 20, 2012. Judge Medina was hailed as a national hero and received 50,000 letters congratulating him on the trial outcome.Belknap (1994) p 221 (50,000 letters). Oakes, p 1460 (\\"national hero\\"). On October 24, Time magazine featured Medina on its cover,Time, October 24, 1949. Retrieved January 31, 2012. and soon thereafter he was asked to consider running for governor of New York.Oakes, p 1460. Medina chose to not run for governor. On June 11, 1951, Truman nominated Medina to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, where he served until 1980.  Bail and prison  After sentencing, the defendants posted bail, enabling them to remain free during the appeal process. The $260,000 bail ($ in dollars) was provided by Civil Rights Congress, a non-profit trust fund which was created to assist CPUSA members with legal expenses.Belknap (1977), p 123. While out on bail, Hall was appointed to a position in the secretariat within the CPUSA. Eugene Dennis wasin addition to his Smith Act chargesfighting contempt of Congress charges stemming from an incident in 1947 when he refused to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee. He appealed the contempt charge, but the Supreme Court upheld his conviction for contempt in March 1950, and he began to serve a one-year term at that time.Associated Press, \\"Justices Uphold Red Conviction\\", Spokesman-Review, March 28, 1950. The conviction was upheld in Dennis v. United States, 339 U.S. 162 (1950). While waiting for their legal appeals to be heard, the CPUSA leaders became convinced that the government would undertake the prosecution of many additional Party officers. To ensure continuity of their leadership, they decided that four of the defendants should go into hiding and lead the CPUSA from outside prison.Belknap (1994), pp 224‚Äì225. The defendants were ordered to report to prison on July 2, 1951, after the Supreme Court upheld their convictions and their legal appeals were exhausted. When July arrived, only seven defendants reported to prison, and four (Winston, Green, Thompson, and Hall) went into hiding, forfeiting $80,000 bail ($ in dollars). Hall was captured in Mexico in 1951, trying to flee to the Soviet Union. Thompson was captured in California in 1952. Both had three years added to their five-year sentences. Winston and Green surrendered voluntarily in 1956 after they felt that anti-communist hysteria had diminished. Some of the defendants did not fare well in prison: Thompson was attacked by an anti-communist inmate; Winston became blind because a brain tumor was not treated promptly; Gates was put into solitary confinement because he refused to lock the cells of fellow inmates; and Davis was ordered to mop floors because he protested against racial segregation in prison.Martelle, pp 256‚Äì257.  Perception of communism after the trial  Senator Joseph McCarthy was a prominent anti-communist. After the convictions, the Cold War continued in the international arena. In December 1950, Truman declared a national emergency in response to the Korean War. The First Indochina War continued in Vietnam, in which communist forces in the north fought against French Union forces in the south. The US expanded the Radio Free Europe broadcasting system in an effort to promote Western political ideals in Eastern Europe. In March 1951, American communists Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted of spying for the Soviet Union. In 1952, the US exploded its first hydrogen bomb, and the Soviet Union followed suit in 1953.Gregory, Ross, Cold War America, 1946 to 1990, Infobase Publishing, 2003, pp 48‚Äì53, . Kort, Michael, The Columbia Guide to the Cold War, Columbia University Press, 2001, . Walker, Martin, The Cold War: a History, Macmillan, 1995, . Domestically, the Cold War was in the forefront of national consciousness. In February 1950, Senator Joseph McCarthy rose suddenly to national fame when he claimed \\"I have here in my hand a list\\" of over 200 communists who were employed in the State Department. McCarthy made the claim in The Wheeling speech. In September 1950, the US Congress passed the McCarran Internal Security Act, which required communist organizations to register with the government, and formed the Subversive Activities Control Board to investigate persons suspected of engaging in subversive activities. High-profile hearings involving alleged communists included the 1950 conviction of Alger Hiss, the 1951 trial of the Rosenbergs, and the 1954 investigation of J. Robert Oppenheimer. The convictions in the 1949 trial encouraged the Department of Justice to prepare for additional prosecutions of CPUSA leaders. Three months after the trial, in January 1950, a representative of the Justice Department testified before Congress during appropriation hearings to justify an increase in funding to support Smith Act prosecutions.Sabin, p 56. See also Fast, Howard, \\"The Big Finger\\", Masses & Mainstream, March, 1950, pp 62‚Äì68. He testified that there were 21,105 potential persons that could be indicted under the Smith Act, and that 12,000 of those would be indicted if the Smith Act was upheld as constitutional. The FBI had compiled a list of 200,000 persons in its Communist Index; since the CPUSA had only around 32,000 members in 1950, the FBI explained the disparity by asserting that for every official Party member, there were ten persons who were loyal to the CPUSA and ready to carry out its orders.Sabin, p 56 (200,000 figure). Navasky, p 26 (32,000 figure). Seven months after the convictions, in May 1950, Hoover gave a radio address in which he declared \\"communists have been and are today at work within the very gates of America.... Wherever they may be, they have in common one diabolic ambition: to weaken and to eventually destroy American democracy by stealth and cunning.\\"Heale, M. J., American Anticommunism: Combating the Enemy Within, 1830‚Äì1970, JHU Press, 1990, p 162, . Hoover quoted by Heale. Sabin, p 56. Other federal government agencies also worked to undermine organizations, such as the CPUSA, they considered subversive: The Internal Revenue Service investigated 81 organizations that were deemed to be subversive, threatening to revoke their tax exempt status; Congress passed a law prohibiting members of subversive organizations from obtaining federal housing benefits; and attempts were made to deny Social Security benefits, veterans benefits, and unemployment benefits to communist sympathizers.Sabin, p 60.  Legal appeals of 1949 trial  The 1949 trial defendants appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in 1950. In the appeal they raised issues about the use of informant witnesses, the impartiality of the jury and judge, the judge's conduct, and free speech.Belknap (2005), pp 258‚Äì259. Their free speech arguments raised important constitutional issues: they asserted that their political advocacy was protected by the First Amendment, because the CPUSA did not advocate imminent violence, but instead merely promoted revolution as an abstract concept.  Free speech law  One of the major issues raised on appeal was that the defendants' political advocacy was protected by the First Amendment, because the CPUSA did not advocate imminent violence, but instead merely promoted revolution as an abstract concept. In the early twentieth century, the primary legal test used in the United States to determine if speech could be criminalized was the bad tendency test.Rabban, pp 132‚Äì134, 190‚Äì199. Rooted in English common law, the test permitted speech to be outlawed if it had a tendency to harm public welfare. One of the earliest cases in which the Supreme Court addressed punishment after material was published was Patterson v. Colorado (1907) in which the Court used the bad tendency test to uphold contempt charges against a newspaper publisher who accused Colorado judges of acting on behalf of local utility companies.Patterson v. Colorado, 205 U.S. 454 (1907). Anti-war protests during World War I gave rise to several important free speech cases related to sedition and inciting violence. In the 1919 case Schenck v. United States the Supreme Court held that an anti-war activist did not have a First Amendment right to speak out against the draft.Killian, p 1093.Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47 (1919). In his majority opinion, Justice Holmes introduced the clear and present danger test, which would become an important concept in First Amendment law; but the Schenck decision did not formally adopt the test. Holmes later wrote that he intended the clear and present danger test to refine, not replace, the bad tendency test.Rabban, pp 285‚Äì286. Although sometimes mentioned in subsequent rulings, the clear and present danger test was never endorsed by the Supreme Court as a test to be used by lower courts when evaluating the constitutionality of legislation that regulated speech.Killian, pp 1096, 1100. Currie, David P., The Constitution in the Supreme Court: The Second Century, 1888‚Äì1986, Volume 2, University of Chicago Press, 1994, p 269, . Konvitz, Milton Ridvad, Fundamental Liberties of a Free People: Religion, Speech, Press, Assembly, Transaction Publishers, 2003, p 304, . Eastland, p 47.The Court would adopt the imminent lawless action test in 1969's Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969), which some commentators view as a modified version of the clear and present danger test. The Court continued to use the bad tendency test during the early twentieth century in cases such as 1919's Abrams v. United States which upheld the conviction of anti-war activists who passed out leaflets encouraging workers to impede the war effort.Abrams v. United States, 250 U.S. 616 (1919). The bad tendency test was also used in Frohwerk v. United States, 249 U.S. 204 (1919); Debs v. United States, 249 U.S. 211 (1919); and Schaefer v. United States, 251 U.S. 466 (1920). See Rabban, David, \\"Clear and Present Danger Test\\", in The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States, p 183, 2005, . In Abrams, Holmes and Justice Brandeis dissented and encouraged the use of the clear and present test, which provided more protection for speech.Killian, p. 1094. Rabban, p 346. Redish, p 102. In 1925's Gitlow v. New York, the Court extended the First Amendment to the states, and upheld the conviction of Gitlow for publishing the \\"Left Wing Manifesto\\".Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S. 652 (1925). Gitlow was decided based on the bad tendency test, but the majority decision acknowledged the validity of the clear and present danger test, yet concluded that its use was limited to Schenck-like situations where the speech was not specifically outlawed by the legislature.Redish, p 102. Kemper, p 653. Brandeis and Holmes again promoted the clear and present danger test, this time in a concurring opinion in 1927's Whitney v. California decision.Dunlap, William V., \\"National Security and Freedom of Speech\\", in Finkelman (vol 1), pp 1072‚Äì1074.Whitney v. California 274 U.S. 357 (1927). The majority did not adopt or use the clear and present danger test, but the concurring opinion encouraged the Court to support greater protections for speech, and it suggested that \\"imminent danger\\"a more restrictive wording than \\"present danger\\"should be required before speech can be outlawed.Redish pp 102‚Äì104. Killian, p 1095. After Whitney, bad tendency tests continued to be used by the Court in cases such 1931's Stromberg v. California, which held that a 1919 California statute banning red flags was unconstitutional.Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. 359 (1931). Killian, p 1096. Another case from that era that used the bad tendency test was Fiske v. Kansas, 274 U.S. 380 (1927). The clear and present danger test was invoked by the majority in the 1940 Thornhill v. Alabama decision in which a state anti- picketing law was invalidated.Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U.S. 88 (1940). Although the Court referred to the clear and present danger test in a few decisions following Thornhill,Including Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296 (1940): \\"When clear and present danger of riot, disorder, interference with traffic upon the public streets, or other immediate threat to public safety, peace, or order appears, the power of the State to prevent or punish is obvious.‚Ä¶ we think that, in the absence of a statute narrowly drawn to define and punish specific conduct as constituting a clear and present danger to a substantial interest of the State, the petitioner's communication, considered in the light of the constitutional guarantees, raised no such clear and present menace to public peace and order as to render him liable to conviction of the common law offense in question.\\" And Bridges v. California, 314 U.S. 252 (1941): \\"And, very recently [in Thornhill] we have also suggested that 'clear and present danger' is an appropriate guide in determining the constitutionality of restrictions upon expression ‚Ä¶ What finally emerges from the 'clear and present danger' cases is a working principle that the substantive evil must be extremely serious, and the degree of imminence extremely high, before utterances can be punished.\\" the bad tendency test was not explicitly overruled, and the clear and present danger test was not applied in several subsequent free speech cases involving incitment to violence.Antieu, Chester James, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, Wm. S. Hein Publishing, 1998, p 219, . Antieu names Feiner v. New York, 340 U.S. 315 (1951); Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire 315 U.S. 568 (1942); and Kovacs v. Cooper, 335 U.S. 77 (1949).  Appeal to the federal Court of Appeals  In May 1950, one month before the appeals court heard oral arguments in the CPUSA case, the Supreme Court ruled on free speech issues in American Communications Association v. Douds. In that case the Court considered the clear and present danger test, but rejected it as too mechanical and instead introduced a balancing test.Eastland, p 47. Killian, p 1101. American Communications Association v. Douds 339 U.S. 382 (1950). The federal appeals court heard oral arguments in the CPUSA case on June 21‚Äì23, 1950. Two days later, on June 25, South Korea was invaded by forces from communist North Korea, marking the start of the Korean War; during the two months that the appeals court judges were forging their opinions, the Korean War dominated the headlines.Belknap (1994), p 222. On August 1, 1950, the appeals court unanimously upheld the convictions in an opinion written by Judge Learned Hand. Judge Hand considered the clear and present danger test, but his opinion adopted a balancing approach similar to that suggested in American Communications Association v. Douds.Eastland, pp 96, 112‚Äì113. Sabin, p 79. O'Brien, pp 7‚Äì8. Belknap (1994), p 222. Walker, p 187. Belknap, Michal, The Vinson Court: Justices, Rulings, and Legacy, ABC-CLIO, 2004, p 109, . Kemper, p 655. In his opinion, Hand wrote: > In each case they [the courts] must ask whether the gravity of the 'evil', > discounted by its improbability, justifies such invasion of free speech as > is necessary to avoid the danger.... The American Communist Party, of which > the defendants are the controlling spirits, is a highly articulated, well > contrived, far spread organization, numbering thousands of adherents, > rigidly and ruthlessly disciplined, many of whom are infused with a > passionate Utopian faith that is to redeem mankind....

Dennis et al (183 F.2d 201) Justia. Retrieved March 20, 2012. The opinion specifically mentioned the contemporary dangers of communism worldwide, with emphasis on the Berlin Airlift.Smith, J. Y., \\"Harold R. Medina, 102, Dies; Ran 1949 Conspiracy Trial\\", The Washington Post, March 17, 1990. Sabin, p 79 (Cold War in Dennis case).  Appeal to the Supreme Court  Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson wrote the opinion in Dennis v. United States. The defendants appealed the Second Circuit's decision to the Supreme Court in Dennis v. United States. During the Supreme Court appeal, the defendants were assisted by the National Lawyers Guild and the ACLU. The Supreme Court limited its consideration to the questions of the constitutionality of the Smith Act and the jury instructions, and did not rule on the issues of impartiality, jury composition, or informant witnesses. The 6‚Äì2 decision was issued on June 4, 1951, and upheld Hand's decision. Chief Justice Fred Vinson's opinion stated that the First Amendment does not require that the government must wait \\"until the putsch is about to be executed, the plans have been laid and the signal is awaited\\" before it interrupts seditious plots.Belknap (1994), p 223. Vinson quoted by Belknap. In his opinion, Vinson endorsed the balancing approach used by Judge Hand:Dennis v. United States ‚Äì 341 U.S. 494 (1951) Justia. Retrieved March 20, 2012.Killian, p 1100. Kemper, pp 654‚Äì655. Vinson's opinion also addressed the contention that Medina's jury instructions were faulty. The defendants claimed that Medina's statement that \\"as matter of law that there is sufficient danger of a substantive evil that the Congress has a right to prevent to justify the application of the statute under the First Amendment of the Constitution\\" was erroneous, but Vinson concluded that the instructions were an appropriate interpretation of the Smith Act. The Supreme Court was, in one historian's words, \\"bitterly divided\\" on the First Amendment issues presented by Dennis.O'Brien, pp 7‚Äì8 Justices Hugo Black and William O. Douglas dissented from the majority opinion. In his dissent, Black wrote \\"public opinion being what it now is, few will protest the conviction of these Communist petitioners. There is hope, however, that, in calmer times, when present pressures, passions and fears subside, this or some later Court will restore the First Amendment liberties to the high preferred place where they belong in a free society.\\"Sabin, p 84. Black quoted by Sabin. Morgan, pp 317‚Äì318. Following the Dennis decision, the Court utilized balancing tests for free speech cases, and rarely invoked the clear and present danger test.Killian, p 1103. Eastland, p 112.  Appeal of contempt sentences  The defense attorneys appealed their contempt sentences, which were handed out by Judge Medina under Rule 42 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.Rule 42(a), Fed.Rules Crim.Proc., 18 U.S.C.A. The attorneys raised a variety of issues on appeal, including the purported misconduct of the judge, and the claim that they were deprived of due process because there was no hearing to evaluate the merits of the contempt charge. They argued that the contempt charges would prevent future CPUSA defendants from obtaining counsel, because attorneys would be afraid of judicial retaliation.From Sacher's majority opinion: \\"We are urged that these sentences will have an intimidating effect on the legal profession, whose members hereafter will decline to appear in trials where 'defendants are objects of hostility of those in power,' or will do so under a 'cloud of fear' which \\"threatens the right of the American people to be represented fearlessly and vigorously by counsel'.\\" The initial appeal to the federal appeals court was not successful: The court reviewed Medina's actions, and reversed some specifications of contempt, but affirmed the convictions.Sacher v. United States 343 U.S. 1 (1952). Retrieved March 20, 2012.The appeals case was United States v. Sacher, 2 Cir., 182 F.2d 416. The attorneys then appealed to the Supreme Court which denied the initial petition, but later reconsidered and accepted the appeal.The initial appeal was 341 U.S. 952, 71 S.Ct. 1010, 95 L.Ed. 1374. The Supreme Court limited their review to the question, \\"was the charge of contempt, as and when certified, one which the accusing judge was authorized under Rule 42(a) to determine and punish himself; or was it one to be adjudged and punished under Rule 42(b) only by a judge other than the accusing one and after notice, hearing, and opportunity to defend?\\". The Supreme Court, in an opinion written by Justice Robert Jackson, upheld the contempt sentences by a 5‚Äì3 vote. Jackson's opinion stated that \\"summary punishment always, and rightly, is regarded with disfavor, and, if imposed in passion or pettiness, brings discredit to a court as certainly as the conduct it penalizes. But the very practical reasons which have led every system of law to vest a contempt power in one who presides over judicial proceedings also are the reasons which account for it being made summary.\\"Sacher v. United States. Justia. Retrieved March 20, 2012.  Trials of \\"second-tier\\" officials  Elizabeth Gurley Flynn was one of the second-tier defendants. After the 1949 convictions, prosecutors waited until the constitutional issues were settled by the Supreme Court before they tried additional leaders of the CPUSA. When the 1951 Dennis decision upholding the convictions was announced, prosecutors initiated indictments of 132 additional CPUSA leaders, called \\"second string\\" or \\"second-tier\\" defendants.Sabin p 59 (the 132 were in addition to the twelve from 1949).

The second-tier defendants were prosecuted in three waves: 1951, 1954, and 1956. Their trials were held in more than a dozen cities, including Los Angeles (15 CPUSA defendants, including Dorothy Healey, leader of the California branch of the CPUSA); New York (21 defendants, including National Committee members Claudia Jones and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn); Honolulu, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Baltimore, Seattle, Detroit, St. Louis, Denver, Boston, Puerto Rico, and New Haven.Edson, Peter, \\"New Anti-Red Laws Requested\\", Lawrence Journal-World, July 15, 1954, p 4. Navasky, p 33. Belknap (1994) p 225.Other CPUSA members indicted included: Robert Klonsky (Philadelphia); and Alexander Bittelman, Alexander Trachtenberg, V. J. Jerome, and Betty Garrett (New York). The second-tier defendants had a difficult time finding lawyers to represent them. The five defense attorneys at the 1949 trial had been jailed for contempt of court, and both Abraham J. Isserman and Harry Sacher were disbarred.Sabin, pp 47‚Äì48. Attorneys for other Smith Act defendants routinely found themselves attacked by courts, attorneys' groups, and licensing boards, leading many defense attorneys to shun Smith Act cases.Sabin, p 48. Auerbach , p 245‚Äì248. Rabinowitz, Victor, A History of the National Lawyers Guild: 1937‚Äì1987, National Lawyers Guild Foundation, 1987, p 28. Some defendants were forced to contact more than one hundred attorneys before finding one who would take their case;Auerbach, p 248. defendant Steve Nelson could not find a lawyer in Pennsylvania who would represent him in his Smith Act trial, so he was forced to represent himself.Auerbach, p 249. Judges sometimes had to appoint unwilling counsel for defendants who could not find a lawyer to take their cases.Navasky, p 37. The National Lawyers Guild provided some lawyers to the defendants, but in 1953 Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr. threatened to list the Guild as a subversive organization, causing half its members to leave.Brown, Sarah Hart, Standing Against Dragons: Three Southern Lawyers in an Era of Fear, LSU Press, 2000, pp 21‚Äì22, . Navasky, p 37. Some second-tier defendants were unable to post bail because the government refused to permit the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) legal defense fund to provide bail funding.Sabin, pp 49‚Äì50.The California defendants challenged their $50,000 bail ($ in dollars) as excessively high, and won in the Stack v. Boyle 342 U.S. 1 (1951) Supreme Court case. The CRC had run afoul of the judicial system because it had posted bail for the 1949 trial defendants, and four of those defendants skipped bail in 1951. Leaders of the CRC were called before a grand jury and asked to identify the donors who had contributed money to the bail fund. Novelist Dashiell Hammett, a manager of the CRC fund, invoked the Fifth Amendment, refused to identify donors, and was sentenced to six months in prison. To supply witnesses for the second-tier trials, the Justice Department relied on a dozen informants, who traveled full-time from trial to trial, testifying about communism and the CPUSA. The informants were paid for their time; for example, Budenz earned $70,000 ($ in dollars) from his activities as a witness.Oshinsky, David M., A Conspiracy So Immense: the World of Joe McCarthy, Oxford University Press, 2005, p 149, (discusses Budenz's income, which includes revenue from lectures and books, as well as compensation from the government for testifying). Navasky, pp 33, 38. Sabin, pp 62‚Äì63.  California convictions reversed  Earl Warren, Chief Justice when Yates was decided in 1957. The federal appeals courts upheld all convictions of second-tier officials. The Supreme Court refused to hear their appeals until 1956, when it agreed to hear the appeal of the California defendants; this led to the landmark Yates v. United States decision.Starobin, p 208. Levin, p 1488. Fourteen second-tier CPUSA officials from California who had been convicted of Smith Act violations appealed, and on June 17, 1957, known as \\"Red Monday\\", the Supreme Court reversed their convictions. By the time the Court ruled 6‚Äì1 in Yates v. United States, four of the Supreme Court Justices who had supported the 1951 Dennis decision had been replaced, including Chief Justice Vinson. He was replaced by Chief Justice Earl Warren. The decision in Yates undermined the 1951 Dennis decision by holding that contemplation of abstract, future violence may not be prohibited by law, but that urging others to act in violent ways may be outlawed.Belknap (2001), p 869 (defines the term \\"Red Monday\\"; on that day, a companion case, Watkins v. United States, was also decided). Sabin, p 10. Writing for the majority, Justice John Marshall Harlan introduced the notion of balancing society's right of self-preservation against the right to free speech. He wrote:Yates v.

But governmental suppression of causes and beliefs seems to me to be the very antithesis of what our Constitution stands for.

Membership clause  Four years after the Yates decision, the Supreme Court reversed the conviction of another second-tier CPUSA leader, John Francis Noto of New York, in the 1961 Noto v. United States case.Noto v. United States 367 U.S. 290 (1961) Justia. Retrieved March 20, 2012. The preceding federal appeals case, which upheld the conviction, was United States v. John Francis Noto, 262 F.2d 501 (2d Cir. 1958) Noto was convicted under the membership clause of the Smith Act, and he challenged the constitutionality of that clause on appeal. The membership clause was in the portion of the Smith Act that made it a crime \\"to organize or help to organize any society, group, or assembly of persons who teach, advocate, or encourage the overthrow or destruction of any government in the United States by force or violence; or to be or become a member of, or affiliate with, any such society, group, or assembly of persons, knowing the purposes thereof ...\\". In a unanimous decision, the court reversed the conviction because the evidence presented at trial was not sufficient to demonstrate that the Party was advocating action (as opposed to mere doctrine) of forcible overthrow of the government.Konvitz, \\"Noto v. United States\\", p 697: \\"There must be substantial evidence, direct or circumstantial, of a call to violence 'now or in the future' that is both 'sufficiently strong and sufficiently persuasive' to lend color to the 'ambiguous theoretical material' regarding Communist party teaching ... and also substantial evidence to justify the reasonable inference that the call to violence may fairly be imputed to the party as a whole and not merely to a narrow segment of it.\\" On behalf of the majority, Justice Harlan wrote:Noto v.

In their concurring opinions, Justices Black and Douglas argued that the membership clause of the Smith Act was unconstitutional on its face as a violation of the First Amendment, with Douglas writing that \\"the utterances, attitudes, and associations in this case ... are, in my view, wholly protected by the First Amendment, and not subject to inquiry, examination, or prosecution by the Federal Government.\\"  Final conviction  In 1958 at his second trial, Junius Scales, the leader of the North Carolina branch of the CPUSA, became the final CPUSA member convicted under the Smith Act. He was the only one convicted after the Yates decision.Scales was initially convicted in 1955, but the sentence was overturned on appeal due to procedural mistakes by the prosecution; and he was retried in 1958. The 1957 reversal is Scales v. U. S., 355 U.S. 1, 78 S.Ct. 9, 2 L.Ed.2d 19 FindLaw. Retrieved March 20, 2012. Prosecutors pursued Scales' case because he specifically advocated violent political action and gave demonstrations of martial arts skills. Scales was accused of violating the membership clause of the Smith Act, not the clause prohibiting advocacy of violence against the government.Goldstein, Robert Justin, Political Repression in Modern America, (University of Illinois Press, 1978, 2001) p.417, . Other CPUSA leaders, such as Noto, were convicted under the membership clause, but Scales was the only one whose conviction was not overturned on appeal. In his appeal to the Supreme Court, Scales contended that the 1950 McCarran Internal Security Act rendered the Smith Act's membership clause ineffective, because the McCarran Act explicitly stated that membership in a communist party does not constitute a per se violation of any criminal statute.Scales v. United States, 367 U.S. 203 (1961), Oyez. Retrieved March 20, 2012.The federal appeals case preceding the Supreme Court appeal was 260 F.2d 21 (1958). In 1961, the Supreme Court, in a 5‚Äì4 decision, upheld Scales' conviction, finding that the Smith Act membership clause was not obviated by the McCarran Act, because the Smith Act required prosecutors to prove first, that there was direct advocacy of violence; and second, that the defendant's membership was substantial and active, not merely passive or technical.Willis, Clyde, Student's Guide to Landmark Congressional Laws on the First Amendment, Greenwood, 2002, p 47, .Konvitz, \\"Scales v. United States\\", p 882: \\"Since the Communist party was considered an organization that engaged in criminal activity, the Court saw no constitutional obstacle to the prosecution of a person who actively and knowingly works in its ranks with intent to contribute to the success of its illegal objectives. Even though the evidence disclosed no advocacy for immediate overthrow of the government, the Court held that present advocacy of future action satisfied statutory and constitutional requirements no less than advocacy of immediate action.\\" Two Justices of the Supreme Court who had supported the Yates decision in 1957, Harlan and Frankfurter, voted to uphold Scales' conviction. Scales was the only defendant convicted under the membership clause. All others were convicted of conspiring to overthrow the government. President Kennedy commuted his sentence on Christmas Eve, 1962, making Scales the final Smith Act defendant released from prison.. See also: and Sabin, p 60. Scales is the only Supreme Court decision to uphold a conviction based solely upon membership in a political party.Tate, Cindy L., Mersky, Roy M., Hartman, Gary R., \\"Scales v. United States\\", in Landmark Supreme Court Cases, Infobase Publishing, 2004, pp 428‚Äì429, .  Aftermath  The Yates and Noto decisions undermined the Smith Act and marked the beginning of the end of CPUSA membership inquiries.Walker, pp 240‚Äì242. When the trials came to an end in 1958, 144 people had been indicted, resulting in 105 convictions, with cumulative sentences totaling 418 years and $435,500 ($ in dollars) in fines.Belknap (1994), pp 225‚Äì226. Sabin, p 60. Not all indictments led to convictions: ten were acquitted, one died, three did not go to trial due to ill health, and one had a hung jury (Belknap (1994) p 225). Fewer than half the convicted communists served jail time. The Smith Act, , though amended several times, has not been repealed.Wolf, Adam B., \\"Anti-Anarchy and Anti-Syndicalism Statutes\\", in Finkelman (vol 1), p 68. The provision requiring registration was revoked in 1982. See Murphy, Paul, \\"Alien Registration Act 54 Stat. 670 (1940)\\", in Encyclopedia of the American Constitution, Volume 1, Macmillan Reference USA, 2000, p 68, . For two decades after the Dennis decision, free speech issues related to advocacy of violence were decided using balancing tests such as the one initially articulated in Dennis.Including cases such as Konigsberg v. State Bar of California, 366 U.S. 36 (1961). Killian, pp 1101‚Äì1103. In 1969, the court established stronger protections for speech in the landmark case Brandenburg v. Ohio which held that \\"the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action\\".Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969).Redish pp 104‚Äì106. Killian, pp 1109‚Äì1110. Brandenburg is now the standard applied by the Court to free speech issues related to advocacy of violence.E.g. in cases such as Hess v. Indiana, 414 U.S. 105 (1973). Redish, p 105. Kemper, p 653. The Smith Act trials decimated the leadership ranks of the CPUSA. Immediately after the 1949 trial, the CPUSAalarmed at the undercover informants that had testified for the prosecutioninitiated efforts to identify and exclude informers from its membership. The FBI encouraged these suspicions by planting fabricated evidence which suggested that many innocent Party members were FBI informants.Powers, p 216. Dennis attempted to provide leadership from inside the Atlanta penitentiary, but prison officials censored his mail and successfully isolated him from the outside world. Prison officials from the Lewisburg prison prevented Williamson from writing to anyone other than immediate family members. Lacking leadership, the CPUSA suffered from internal dissension and disorder, and by 1953 the CPUSA's leadership structure was inoperative.Belknap (1994), p 226. In 1956, Nikita Khrushchev revealed the reality of Stalin's purges, causing many remaining CPUSA members to quit in disillusionment.Martelle, p 255. By the late 1950s, the CPUSA's membership had dwindled to 5,000, of whom over 1,000 may have been FBI informants.Gentry, Kurt, J. Edgar Hoover: The Man and the Secrets, W. W. Norton & Company, 1991, p 442, . Defendant Gus Hall ran for president four times after being released from prison. The defendants at the 1949 trial were released from prison in the mid-1950s. Gus Hall served as a Party leader for another 40 years; he supported the policies of the Soviet Union, and ran for president four times from 1972 to 1984. Eugene Dennis continued to be involved in the CPUSA and died in 1961. Benjamin J. Davis died in 1964. Jack Stachel, who continued working on the Daily Worker, died in 1966. John Gates became disillusioned with the CPUSA after the revelation of Stalin's Great Purge; he quit the Party in 1958 and later gave a television interview to Mike Wallace in which he blamed the CPUSA's \\"unshaken faith\\" in the Soviet Union for the organization's downfall.Martelle, p 255. Gates quoted by Martelle. Mike Wallace interview of John Gates, January 18, 1958. University of Texas at Austin. Henry Winston became co-chair of the CPUSA (with Hall) in 1966 and was awarded the Order of the October Revolution by the Soviet Union in 1976. After leaving prison, Carl Winter resumed Party activities, became editor of the Daily Worker in 1966, and died in 1991. Gil Green was released from Leavenworth prison in 1961 and continued working with the CPUSA to oppose the Vietnam War. Party leader William Z. Foster, 69 years old at the time of the 1949 trial, was never tried due to ill health; he retired from the Party in 1957 and died in Moscow in 1961.Buhle, Mari Jo, The American Radical, Psychology Press, 1994, p 202, . John Williamson was released early, in 1955, and deported to England, although he had lived in the United States since the age of ten.Martelle, p 254. Irving Potash moved to Poland after his release from prison, then re-entered the United States illegally in 1957, and was arrested and sentenced to two years for violating immigration laws. Robert G.

History of the Garrison Church The Church is approached by way of Old Contemptibles Avenue In January 1854 some 25,000 acres of Aldershot Heath were purchased with the view to setting up a permanent military camp in the area. The outbreak of the Crimean War later in the same year led to a military mobilisation and in 1855 12,000 huts were constructed in the Aldershot area to house the 20,000 militia who had been called up. It was soon apparent that the size of Camp that Aldershot had become by this time would need a Church, so a small iron building was commissioned; this was the only Church in the Camp at Aldershot from 1855 until 1863 and was on the site now occupied by the Garrison Church of St Andrew on Queens Avenue. When Parliament decided to make Aldershot a permanent Camp in 1857 a new site was chosen for the building of a permanent Garrison Church near to the Royal Pavilion, and this is the Garrison Church we see today.Lt.

The 1st Division went into action at High Wood in September 1916 and over the next few days saw some of the bloodiest hand-to-hand fighting during the Battle of the Somme which left the trenches thick with British and German dead. After the battle the 1st Division engineers put up a memorial cross at High Wood using wood taken from the ruins of Bazentin village. As after the War there was a permanent stone memorial to the 1st Division at Le Cateau the cross at High Wood had to be removed or left to decay; instead, it was brought back to the UK. The cross was re-erected in 1927 outside the 1st Division Headquarters in Pennefather‚Äôs Road in Aldershot. In January 1939, to protect it from the elements, the Somme Cross was moved from Pennefather‚Äôs Road into the south porch, which then became the 1st Division Porchway and where it has remained ever since. Furnishings The Great East Window The Chancel showing the Great East Window The biggest stained glass window in the church, it was commissioned by the 37th Hampshires to commemorate the officers, non- commissioned officers and men of the regiment who had been killed during the Indian Mutiny of 1857 to 1859. It was designed in the Geometric style of architecture as found in churches built during the period c.1307-1337. The central panel shows the Resurrection with Christ emerging victorious from his tomb carrying a flag to symbolise his victory over death. The two panels on the left show Joshua while the two on the right depict Gideon.Adams et al (ibid) p4 The Altar Both the main altars at the east end of the church are of wood and were originally without any form of hangings. The carving on the front of the main altar is very fine; it was presented to the Church by the All Saints Branch of the Guild of St Helene. The various frontals and hangings used on the altar throughout the Church Year have been received from various donors.Adams et al (ibid) p5 The Organ The organ was built by Brindley and Foster in 1900, and is the second instrument to stand in the Church. It has 1749 pipes and three manuals and pedals and eighteen speaking stops, with provision for another twenty-two stops which have subsequently been added plus an additional three. The gilded pipes on the north aisle screen are only dummies, and are not connected to the organ in any way.Adams et al (ibid) p8 The Pulpit font The carved oak pulpit is a memorial to Sir James Alleyn, RA and dates to 1899. In the four quatrefoils at the base of the pulpit are the traditional symbols of the Four Evangelists: the eagle for St John; the lion for St Mark; the bull for St Luke, and the angel for St Matthew.Adams et al (ibid) p8 The Font The font is rather plain and heavy in design but is unusual in that, unlike most fonts, it is square in shape. On the outside are the symbols of the Four Evangelists with their names in Latin: Sanctus Joannes, Sanctus Marcus, Sanctus Lucas and Sanctus Mattheus.Adams et al (ibid) p17 The Parachute Regiment Kneelers Since 1967 the church has been the \\"spiritual home of The Paras\\".Adams et al (ibid) p24 All the soldiers from the regiment who died during World War Two are remembered with their own individual kneeler. Wall memorials Memorial to James Yorke Scarlett There are many eminent soldiers commemorated: among them Frederick Arthur Montague Browning, James Yorke Scarlett, James Hope Grant, Henry Renny, Henry Jenner Scobell and Neil Douglas Findlay Scarlett's memorial includes a bronze bust of Scarlett flanked by two full-size bronze cavalry troopers of his former regiments, the 18th Hussars and 5th Dragoon Guards, wearing VCs, four-bar Crimean War medals and Long Service and Good Conduct medals.

It was originally the a hound-whelp of the smith or the king of Iruaith (Ioruath, Hiruaidhe, etc.). Later on, Lugh's Failinis (var. Fer Mac) belonged to a foreign threesome from Iruaith that came to Ireland, and encountered by the F√≠anna led by Fionn mac Cumhaill in the Fenian cycle.  Name variants  The puppy is referred to as the \\"whelp of the royal smith of Ioruath\\" but otherwise unnamed in the 12th century Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn (\\"Book of Invasions\\") version of the story of the sorrows of the sons of Tuireann. It is named in the lengthier, romance version of this story, Fate of the Children of Tuireann ed., tr. Fate of the Children of Tuireann Aoidhe Chloinne Tuireann. or Oidheadh Chloinne Tuireann, abbreviated OCT of much later date, with the earliest manuscript dating to the 17th century. Eugene O'Curry hypothesized the name Failinis to be a transposition of \\"Inis F√°il (Island of Fail)\\", an ancient name for Ireland; ed., tr., Fate of the Children of Tuireann, p. 190, n201. R. A. S. Macalister also stating that the name \\"sounds like an extra-ordinary mythlogical mix-up\\". However this \\"mix-up\\" was far from modern. As Rudolf Thurneysen noted, a virtually identical name for the pup, Failinis or , occurs in a medieval 11th or early 12th century ballad from the Fenian cycle., cited by , notes, pp. 302‚Äì303. The dog's name is Fer Mac (Fermac) in the prose version of the ballad's story in The Colloquy with the Ancients of the Fenian Cycle. Although names and circumstances differ, the link between the ballad and the Acallam have been made by A. G. van Hamel and Richard M. Scowcroft.  General description  The hound was invincible in battle, caught every wild beast it encountered, and could magically change any running water it bathed in into wine. It held dominion over all beasts, or hunted all sorts of game including fish. The dog's ability to magically produce wine occurs in several sources. The ability to turn water into wine is mentioned in the \\"Book of Invasions\\" and the ballad, but not in the OCT. In the ballad, \\"mead or wine\\" emanated from the spring water that Failinis bathed in, whereas Fer Mac magically disgorged liquor from its mouth., roga gacha lenna \\"choicest of every kind of liquor\\". . Failinis of the ballad was a \\"hound of the loveliest color\\", mighty and wonderful, while Fer Mac was described as parti-colored, displaying shades of every color including white, black, and blue., The hound of ballad was huge by day (able to \\"overcome fifty men\\"), but was a \\"thunderbolt, ball of fire\\" () by night. translates as \\"ball of fire\\", Stern as \\"\\". Cf. also \\"c√°er\\", eDIL which gives 'meteor, thunderbolt' and 'fireballs'. Similarly, Fer Mac was normally huge, of greater size than any hound, but when dispensing liquor from its mouth it dwindled to the size of a \\"pine marten on a queen's lap\\".Rendered \\"ferret\\" in and a \\"lapdog\\" in , but the original text is (Acall. 5573 , ), and under \\"crann\\" in the DIL the term is glossed as 'pine marten'. Fer Mac also vomited quantities of gold and silver as needed. Its gender is not consistently translated: c√∫ of the ballad has been rendered as a \\"male dog\\" (), but Fer Mac is given as either a \\"bitch\\" or a \\"hound\\".  Change of ownership  It was one of the prized treasures exacted by Lugh L√°mhfhada from the children of Tuireann (Br√≠an, Iuchar and Iucharba) as reparation for the slaying of Lugh's father Cian. The hound was originally owned either by the royal smith of Iruaid or by the King of Iruaid in the Mythological Cycle. This Iruaid, variously spelled, is a mythical Scandinavian kingdom.\\"hirotae\\", Onomasticon Goedelicum The hound was taken by the children of Tuireann (Brian, Iuchar and Iucharba) and delivered over to Lugh L√°mhfhada as part of reparations. ed., tr., Fate of the Children of Tuireann, pp. 212‚Äì215. The same hound Failinis (Shalinnis) that once belonged to Lugh of the Mantles () that the sons of Tuireann () took from the king of Iruaid figures in the Fenian cycle, repackaged as a dog owned by a certain threesome from a foreign land. The owners are Sela, Dorait, Domn√°n in the ballad, and Dub ('Dark'), √Åg ('Batttle') and Ilar ('Eagle') from \\"Ir√∫aith in the East\\", in fact, three princes of Ir√∫aith according to the prose work The Colloquy of the Elders.  Strife and demise  In both the ballad and prose versions of the Fenian cycle story, the threesome slew the warrior(s) of the F√≠anna who spied on them when they were secretly making their wine or heavy drink using their dog. The condemned peepers are Dub√°n mac Bresail in the ballad, and Donn and Dub√°n the two sons of the King of Ulster in The Colloquy. In the ballad, Finn mac Cumhal uses the \\"tooth of wisdom\\" () and discovers the threesome (Sela, Dorait, Domn√°n) to be responsible for Dub√°n's death, and the threesome forfeit the dog Failinis as compensation. The threesome take a solemn oath never to transport the dog alive out of Ireland, but then they kill the hound and flay its hide (, ), and carry it off into foreign lands. In The Colloquy, the F√≠anna form search parties of nine warriors and nine gillies each but fail to discover the whereabouts of the two Ulidian princes. And the threesome and the dog obtain Finn mac Cumhal's protection, even though some of the F√≠anna had entertained designs on eliminating them. \\"The Story of the Oakgrove of Conspiracy\\". The dog Fer Mac's modes of attack are elaborated upon in The Colloquy. It reacted to the spying Ultonian princes at its masters' bidding, summoning a wind of druidry by lifting its tail, causing the two spies to drop shield, spear and sword. The three warriors of Ir√∫aith then killed the Ulstermen, and the bitch blew its breath on the bodies, turning them into dust and ashes, with neither blood nor flesh nor bone remaining. Later, the threesome and the dog provided mercenary work for the F√≠anna, dispatching the three sons of U√°r who were becoming a menace. After Dub of Ir√∫aith pronounced a banishing Incantation, the dog raised a magic wind its tail that sent the enemies to sea, and the enemies were forced by the magic spell to fight one another, receiving fatal sword cuts to their heads. \\"The Story of the Little Rath of the Incantation\\". Attestations Book of Invasions In the Lebor Gabala Erenn (\\"Book of Invasions\\") version of the sorrows of the children of Tuireann, one of Lugh's demanded reparation is an unnamed pup or whelp that belonged to the royal smith of Ioruath (), a legendary Scandinavian kingdom. The textual source(s) here has been dubbed \\"Imthechta Clainne Tuirill (ICT)\\" by T. F. O'Rahilly, a designation which includes the Poem LXVI \\"Etsid in senchas sluagach..\\" and the later prose summary of it which begins \\"Imthechta Clainne Tuirill.. \\" in ¬ß319 of Macalister's edition of the LGE. The poem also sings of the whelp of \\"Luachra Lia\\",. Lebor Gabhala, Poem no. LXVI, stanzas 14. and 15. pp. 286‚Äì287 probably some Scandinavian region (Lochlann), that was a hound by night and sheep by day. Thurneysen was of the opinion that this was a different whelp, but the attributes of these two dogs were melded into one by the prosifier, so that in the prose it was \\"a hound by night and a sheep by day\\" and whatever pool of water touched its hide or pelt () turned to wine.. Lebor Gabhala, ¬ß 319 √©raic 5. pp. 136‚Äì137 and notes, pp. 302‚Äì303. Oidheadh Chloinne Tuireann The hound's name Failinis appears in the full romance version of The Fate of the Children of Tuireann (Oidheadh Chloinne Tuireann), which only survives in manuscripts from the 17th century and later. Failinis belonged to the King of Ioruaidhe () or Hiruath,Oidheadh Cloinne Tuireann (OCT) apud , notes, pp. 302‚Äì303. etc., in this romance version, ed., tr., Fate of the Children of Tuireann, pp. 190, 191 and about this hound it was said that \\"all the wild beasts of the world .. would fall down out of their standing\\" (i.e., prostrate themselves) and that it was \\"more splendid than the sun in his fiery wheels\\". ed., tr., Fate of the Children of Tuireann, pp. 162, 163 The plot is more developed in the romance concerning the brothers' acquisition of the hound. After completing the quest for the pigs of Asal, accompany the sons of Tuireann so he can advise his son-in-law, the King of Ioruaidhe to relinquish the hound without a fight. The counsel is refused, and a battle ensues culminating in a single combat between Brian son of Tuireann and the King of Ioruaidhe, the king is defeated and bound, and forfeits the hound for his release. ed., tr., Fate of the Children of Tuireann, pp. 210‚Äì215 12th- century ballad The name of Lugh's dog Failinis is recorded in medieval manuscripts in a certain \\"ballad\\" (), nominally titled (\\"They came here as a band of three\\") from its initial line. It has been characterized by as an Ossianic ballad of the 12th century, i.e., a pseudepigraphic poem pretended to be written by Ois√≠n reminiscing on the Fianna's past. The ballad relates how a threesome from Iruaid (\\"Hiruath\\", \\"Hiruaithe\\",) brings along a magical dog ( or Failinis) which turns any fresh water (spring water) it touches into mead or wine. The dog once belonged to Lugh of the mantles (, a corruption of Lugh's matronymic \\"Lugh mac Ethlenn\\", as pointed out by Stern. The threesome is using the dog to turn spring water into wine and drinking it, when one of the Fianna (Dub√°n mac Bresail) intrudes, so the three kill Dub√°n. Finn mac Cumhal, by (placing his thumb under\\"d√©t\\", DIL. \\"d.¬§ fiss Fionn's wisdom-tooth under which he placed his thumb when seeking inspiration\\".) his tooth of wisdom () discovers the threesome (Sela, Dorait, Domn√°n) to be responsible for Dub√°n's death, and the threesome forfeit the dog Failinis as compensation, swearing by the sun and the moon they would never take it alive out of Ireland, but then they kill the hound and flay it, carrying off the dog's hide its hide across the sea, north-eastwards or eastwards. The Fianna's pursuit ensues, to no avail. The Colloquy of the Elders The stories relating to the three princes of Ior√∫aithe and their wonder-dog in the Acallam na Sen√≥rach (The Colloquy of the Ancients) are closely summarized by A. G. van Hamel., endnote 2. And van Hamel has noted that gaps in the story of the hound in The Colloquy can be filled with the use of the Fenian ballad, as well as noting connections to the hound the LGE tract and romance about the sons of Tuireann. Richard M. Scowcroft also connects the ballad to The Colloquy. The story of is written in the form of a frame story where Ca√≠lte who is a survivor of the F√≠anna into the age of Saint Patrick the \\"Adze-Head\\" recount various adventures of the F√≠anna relating to various place names (onomastics). Thus the arrival of the three men who are sons of the King of Ior√∫aith, accompanied by the dog occurs in the story of the Little Fort of the Wonders ().; \\"the little rath of wonders\\"Acall. 5448, The spying by the two princes of Ulster and their killing by the men and hound occurs in the explanation regarding the two landmark graves, and it is within this episode that the hound's name is revealed to be Fer Mac or Fermac.; \\"two great graves\\" in Munster. The Fianna deliberate on the fate of the three in the story of the Oakwood of the Conspiracy (), within which Ca√≠lte plays advocate and defend the three men, extolled the virtues of their skill as well as the hound's hunting prowess. And the three and the hound defeating three red-haired sons of U√°r (on behalf of the F√≠anna) occurs in the story of the Little Fort of the Incantations ().

Early life John Daniel Tate was born on November 10, 1955 to David Munroe Tate Jr. and Hazel Ella Tate in Beaumont, Texas. At 6 years old, Tate's family moved to Camden, Arkansas where his father, a music minister, accepted a position at a new church. There, he spent his formative years absorbing the musical and religious influences of a classic small town setting. In 1974, Tate left home to attend college, where he studied under the renowned composer and conductor, William Francis McBeth. Tate graduated Who's Who in American Colleges and Universities and is a member of Mensa. In 1989 Governor Bill Clinton appointed Tate \\"Arkansas Traveler\\"-Ambassador of Good Will. Career After graduating with a Bachelor of Music in Music Theory and Composition in 1978, Tate found work as a solo performer for the High School Assembly Service out of Chicago, Illinois. Touring continuously on a grueling schedule, Tate performed a combination of popular radio hits, his own songs, and told stories in a one-man show designed for High School students. From 1978 to 1980, Tate performed 600 shows in 3 semesters and had the most successful ratings and sales in the Service's 50-year history. Later in 1980, Tate moved to Nashville with intentions of making a name for himself in the music industry. His big break came when a friend cornered Rick Springfield in a club restroom and handed him a cassette tape of Tate's song \\"Superman\\" which immediately caught Springfield's ear. Tate wrote off the exchange as an impossible probability until he received a phone call from Springfield's manager, who requested the use of a substantial and extremely infectious part of the song. After a melding of minds, the writers came up with the co-written song which morphed into the runaway hit, Affair of the Heart. Springfield's recording of the song peaked at #9 on Billboard charts,Whitburn, Joel (2004). The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits (8th Edition).

Cisalpine Gaul was later added, but was not considered part of Italy in 218 BC. The Roman expansion in Italy covers a series of conflicts in which Rome grew from being a small Italian city-state to be the ruler of the Italian peninsula. Roman tradition attributes to the Roman kings the first war against the Sabines and the first conquests around the Alban Hills and down to the coast of Latium. The birth of the Roman Republic after the overthrow of the Etruscan monarch of Rome in 509 BC began a series of major wars between the Romans and the Etruscans. In 390 BC, Gauls from the north of Italy sacked Rome. In the second half of the 4th century BC Rome clashed repeatedly with the Samnites, a powerful tribal coalition of the Apennine region. By the end of these wars, Rome had become the most powerful state in central Italy and began to expand to the north and to the south. The last threat to Roman hegemony came during the Pyrrhic war (280-275 BC) when Tarentum enlisted the aid of the Greek king Pyrrhus of Epirus to campaign in the South of Italy. Resistance in Etruria was finally crushed in 265-264 BC, the same year the first punic war began and brought Roman forces outside of the peninsula for the first time. Conquered territories were incorporated into the growing Roman state in a number of ways: land confiscations, the establishment of coloniae, granting of full or partial Roman citizenship and military alliances with nominally independent states. The successful conquest of Italy gave Rome access to a manpower pool unrivaled by any contemporary state and paved the way to the eventual Roman domination of the entire Mediterranean world.  Sources  The single most important source on early Roman history is the Roman historian Titus Livius (59 BC ‚Äì 17 AD), usually called Livy in English literature, who wrote a history known as Ab Urbe Condita (From the Foundation of the City) covering the entirety of Rome's history from her mythical origins up to his own times in 142 books. Of these only books 1-10 and 21-45 have survived down to our times, covering the years from the foundation up to 293 and 220‚Äì167 BC. However summaries of the lost books have been preserved, and later historians such as Florus, Eutropius and Orosius used Livy as their source, so that we do have some knowledge of the contents of the lost books. Independently of Livy the Greek historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus (c. 60 ‚Äì after 7 BC) wrote Roman Antiquities in 20 books covering from Rome's origins to 264 BC, with emphasis on the earlier period. Of these the 11 first books have survived, covering the period down to 443. For the latter nine books only fragments exist. Slightly earlier than Livy and Dionysius, the Sicilian Diodorus Siculus (flourished between 60 and 30 BC) wrote Bibliotheca historica a universal history of the Mediterranean world in 46 books. From the historical section of this work books 11‚Äì20 survive intact, covering the years 480‚Äì302 BC. In these books Diodorus chiefly focuses on events in Sicily and the Eastern Mediterranean, but occasionally also refers to Roman history. During the Roman Empire Livy became the standard account on early Roman history, most later histories are therefore ultimately derived from him and of little independent value. Cassius Dio (c. 150 ‚Äì 235 AD) appears to have been an exception, frequently providing details not found in Livy or Dionysius. His books covering early Roman history survive only in fragments, but his work was summarized by the 12th century monk Zonaras. Finally the Greek philosopher Plutarch (c. 46 ‚Äì 120 AD) wrote a series of biographies on famous Greeks and Romans, the Parallel Lives, several of which deal with early Roman history. Of particular importance is his biography of king Pyrrhus of Epirus (319/318 ‚Äì 272 BC) since for the years 292‚Äì264 BC no other substantial narrative has survived.  Reliability of the sources  Livy and Dionysius were born 200 years after the completion of Rome's conquest of Italy and had to rely on earlier, now lost, historians as their sources. The Roman Republic of their times was in many ways fundamentally different from the one that conquered Italy. In antiquity history was primarily a literary genre where strict historical accuracy could be sacrificed in return for a more entertaining or stylistically impressive account. While modern historians generally agree that the sources contain a core of historical information, it is also clear that much of the material surviving to our time suffer from misinterpretations or the outright inventions of the ancient writers. Just how much, and which parts, date back to authentic records remains a matter of some dispute. Another problem is that, except for the Pyrrhic War, all the sources are written from a predominantly Roman point of view. We therefore possess little knowledge of the motivations and internal politics of Rome's many enemies.  Chronology  Rather than assigning an increasing number to each year, like the modern Gregorian calendar, the ancient Romans usually used an eponymous dating system where events were dated by the names of Rome's chief magistrates (typically two consuls). Roman magistrates were elected for one year; as long as the sequence of magistrates (called a fasti) and its synchronization with the modern calendar are known, dates can be converted from one dating system to the other. Thus the year when Marcus Tullius Cicero and Gaius Antonius Hybrida were consuls becomes 63 BC. During the late 1st Century BC Roman scholars worked out a complete chronology of Roman history, dating the foundation of Rome to 753 BC and the beginning of the Roman Republic to 509 BC. Today known as the Varronian Chronology (from one of its early adopters, the famous antiquarian Marcus Terentius Varro), this chronology was made official by the early Roman Empire and has remained the standard ever since. However, for the years prior to 300 BC the Varronian Chronology is no longer considered correct. According to the respected Greek historian Polybius (ca. 200‚Äì118 BC) the sack of Rome by a Gaulish warband took place in the same year as the Peace of Antalcidas which was concluded in 387/386 BC. But according to the Varronian Chronology the Gaulish Sack happened three or four years earlier, in 390 BC. The Varronian Chronology also claims that for five years, 375-371 BC, civil unrest and anarchy in Rome prevented any magistrates from being elected, and in four years, 333, 324, 309 and 301 BC, a dictator, rather than two consuls, was elected to govern Rome for an entire year (the normal maximum term for a dictator was six months). Historians now believe both the lengthy anarchy and the dictator years to be unhistorical. It is likely that Roman scholars who knew that the Gallic Sack and the Peace of Antalicidas were supposed to be synchronous discovered that their list of magistrates, due to errors in transmission, fell short. They then invented an extended anarchy and dictator years to pad out their chronologies to the desired length. By adopting both the anarchy and dictator years the Varronian Chronology has thereby corrected the same problem twice and ended up being too long. Despite these acknowledged errors, academic literature continues, by old convention, to number years according to the Varronian Chronology; this is therefore also the convention adopted in this article.  Early Roman wars  According to traditional accounts Rome was first ruled by seven kings, Romulus, Numa Pompilius, Tullus Hostilius, Ancus Marcius, Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, Servius Tullius, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, all of which, except Numa, are recorded as fighting successful wars against Rome's neighbours. The historicity of these accounts is extremely doubtful. However, Rome must at some point in the regal period have extended her territory to include the Alban hills (traditionally attributed to Tullus Hostilius) and down to the coast (traditionally attributed to Ancus Marcius). These expansions made Rome by far the largest city-state in Latium. Roman territory c. 500 BC has been estimated to about , more than twice as large as the second largest Latin city, Tibur, at . The last king of Rome, Tarquinius Superbus, is portrayed by the sources as a powerful, but tyrannical, king. He is said to have taken Pometia by storm and Gabii by ruse, colonized Signia and Circeii, and to have organized the Latin states into an alliance under his own leadership. However Tarquinius was deposed by a conspiracy led by two of his relatives, Lucius Junius Brutus and Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus. These two then founded the Roman Republic with themselves as its first two consuls; traditionally the overthrow of the monarchy has been dated to 509 BC. Tarquinius is supposed to have sought refuge with king Lars Porsenna of Clusium, who marched against Rome to reinstate the king. After various heroic acts by brave defenders of Rome, Porsenna gave up and instead attacked Aricia, but was defeated by an alliance of Latin cities and the Greek colony of Cumae. Modern historians have had difficulties accepting this tale and have instead proposed that Porsenna actually captured Rome and deposed Tarquinius and replaced him with two leading aristocrats. With leadership of the city divided, Rome would have been easier for Porsenna to control. With the departure of Porsenna, war broke out between Rome and the other Latin states leading to the Battle of Lake Regillus in either 499 or 496 BC. In 493 BC a treaty, the Foedus Cassianum, was concluded, establishing a mutual military alliance between the Latin cities with Rome as the leading partner. A second people, the Hernici, joined the alliance sometime later. While the precise workings of the Latin League remains uncertain, its overall purpose seems clear. During the 5th century the Latins were threatened by invasion from the Aequi and the Volsci, as part of a larger pattern of Sabellian-speaking peoples migrating out of the Apennines and into the plains. Several peripheral Latin communities appear to have been overrun, and the ancient sources record fighting against either the Aequi, the Volsci, or both almost every year during the first half of the 5th century BC. This annual warfare would have been dominated by raids and counter-raids rather than the pitched battles described by the ancient sources.  The beginnings of Roman expansion  The Mars of Todi, a life-sized Etruscan bronze sculpture of a soldier making a votive offering, late 5th to early 5th century BC During the second half of the 5th century BC, the Romans and the Latins appear to have stemmed the tide. The sources record the founding of several Roman colonies during this era, while mention of wars against the Aequi and Volsci become less frequent. At about the same time Rome brought her ancient rivalry with the Etruscan city- state of Veii to a decisive end. In 426 BC Rome captured Fidenae, Veii's foothold on the southern side of the Tiber and in 396 BC Veii fell to Roman arms, supposedly after a ten-year siege. Rome annexed Veii's territory and enrolled her citizens as Roman citizens, significantly increasing Roman territory and manpower. In 390 BC a Gaulish warband first defeated the Roman army at the Battle of Allia and then sacked Rome. Despite ancient sources' emphasis on the severity of the destruction, this appears to have been only a temporary setback for Rome. The records for the first half of the 4th century BC are confused, but Rome appears to have embarked on a deliberate policy of aggression against the Volsci. Fear of Roman expansionism increasingly brought the Latin cities into alliance with the Volsci in a complete reversal of the situation during the 5th century BC. During the same time period Rome also fought wars against her neighbours in southern Etruria, the city-states of Caere, Tarquinii and Falerii, as well as fending off the occasional Gaulish incursion.  The Samnite wars  Samnite infantry and cavalry, fresco from a tomb frieze in Nola, 4th century BC The years 343 - 290 BC were dominated by a series of conflicts between Rome and the Samnites, a powerful coalition of Oscan-speaking peoples. Rome and the Samnites had concluded a treaty of alliance in 354 BC, but overlapping spheres of interest eventually brought them to war. The chief result of the First Samnite War, 343 - 341 BC, was the expansion of Roman influence into Campania with an alliance with the important city-state of Capua. This war was closely followed by the Latin War, 340 - 338 BC, where the Latins and the Volsci made a final bid to shake off Roman dominion. Once again Rome was victorious. In the peace settlement that followed, Rome annexed some states outright, other remained autonomous Latin states, but the Latin League was dissolved. Instead the surviving Latin states were bound to Rome by separate bilateral treaties. The Campanians, who had sided with the Latins, were organized as civitas sine suffragio - citizenship without a vote - which gave them all the rights and duties of a Roman citizen, including that of military service, except the right to vote in the Roman assemblies. This peace settlement was to become a template for how Rome later dealt with other defeated states. Rome spent the next years consolidating her latest conquests. In 328 BC war broke out between Rome and Neapolis, originally a Greek city state which by this date also had a significant Oscan population. This war ended when a pro-Roman faction among the Neapolitans took control of the city and concluded a treaty on favourable terms. Neapolis would remain a faithful Roman ally to the end of the Republic. This war is also notable for the first securely attested case of prorogation when one of the consuls of 327 BC had his command extended into the next year. The Roman alliance with Neapolis and colonization of Fregellae appear to have provoked the Samnites enough to cause the outbreak of the Second Samnite War in 326 BC. In 321 BC Rome suffered a severe defeat when a Roman army had to surrender at the Caudine Forks and were forced to accept a truce with the Samnites. According to traditional accounts the Roman people at once repudiated the truce (concluded by the defeated consuls in the field) and in the next two years completely reversed the Caudine disaster by a series of impressive victories, followed by a two-year truce 318 - 317 BC. Modern historians have put little credence in this, instead believing Roman victories of 320 and 319 BC were later inventions and that Rome and the Samnites were at peace from 320 to 317 BC. Hostilities broke out again in 316 BC. After another reversal at the Battle of Lautulae (an indecisive battle according to Livy, a Roman defeat according to modern historians), the Romans gradually gained the upper hand. After the Roman capture of Bovianum, one of the Samnites' principal towns, the Samnites were forced to sue for peace in 304 BC. Towards the end Second Samnite War, Roman military superiority was great enough that Rome could afford to at the same time launch campaigns into Etruria and Umbria in 311 - 309 BC. In 304 BC Rome also won crushing victories against the Hernici and Aequi and in the following years concluding treaties with the tribes of the Paeligni, Marrucini, Frentani and Vestini, extending her reach to the Adriatic. The Third Samnite War broke out in 298 BC, apparently after the Samnites had attempted to ally with the Lucanians. When this failed, the Samnite commander Gellius Egnatius led his army north to form a coalition with the Etruscans, Umbrians and Gauls. 295 BC turned out to be the turning point of the war. The Romans managed to detach the Etruscan and Umbrian contingents by invading their homelands and then defeated the combined Samnite-Gaulish army at the battle of Sentinum. After suffering from a series of defeats and invasions, the Samnites were in 290 BC forced to accept an alliance on terms imposed by Rome.  Roman hegemony  Bust of Pyrrhus of Epirus at the National Archaeological Museum of Naples The loss of Livy's Books XI - XV means that much less information is available for the years 292 - 264 BC than the preceding decades. It is however clear that Roman expansion continued at an increasing pace, leading to the Roman Republic growing from being the dominant state of central Italy to becoming the hegemon of the entire peninsula. In 290 BC the Roman consul Manius Curius Dentatus conquered the Sabines, who were annexed into the Roman state as citizens without a vote. During 284 - 280 BC the Romans fought a war against the Etruscans and Gauls in northern Italy. After first being defeated at the battle of Arretium, Rome won a decisive victory against the Gauls at the battle of Lake Vadimo leading to the Roman annexation of the ager Gallicus. Simultaneous with these wars Rome's influence in the south was growing. In 285 or 284 BC the Greek city of Thurii appealed to Rome for aid against the Lucanians and Bruttians. In 284 BC, after defeating the Lucanians and Bruttians in battle, Rome installed a garrison in Thurii, supported by a small Roman fleet. This provoked the city of Tarentum, who had long considered herself the dominant Greek city in Magna Graecia. The Tarentines sunk the Roman fleet and captured Thurii, but having drawn the wrath of Rome, realized they needed allies to have any hopes of standing against Rome. Their choice fell on Pyrrhus, king of Epirus and a famous general. Pyrrhus crossed the sea to Italy with his army in 280 BC and that same year defeated the Romans at the battle of Heraclea and again the next year at the battle of Ausculum. These victories however proved to be strategically indecisive when they failed to convince Rome to accept peace on Pyrrhus' terms. With no end in sight Pyrrhus in 278 BC departed for Sicily to aid the Greek cities there against Carthage. He returned to Italy in 275 BC, but this time was defeated by the Romans at the battle of Beneventum. Pyrrhus then left Italy for Greece and after his death in 272 BC the Epirote garrison at Tarentum surrendered the city to the Romans, bringing the Pyrrhic war to an end. While details on these campaigns are scarce, there must also in these years have been extensive fighting between Rome and the Samnites, Lucanians and Bruttians. Roman victories against various combinations of these three peoples are recorded for every single year from 282 to 272 BC. In the years following the Pyrrhic War, Rome completed the conquest of Italy by subduing the Umbrians and Picentes in the north and the Sallentini and Messapii in the south-east. In 264 BC the consul Marcus Fulvius Flaccus put down a social uprising in the Etruscan city of Volsinii and reinstalled the old ruling families in power. That same year his colleague Appius Claudius Caudex led a Roman army across to Sicily, starting the First Punic War and a new phase in the history of the Roman Republic.

Early life She was born in Manea, Cambridgeshire, England on 22 July 1869 to Mary Ann (nee Green) and her husband, Frederick Thurston, a pharmaceutical chemist. She emigrated to New Zealand in 1901 and trained as a nurse at Wellington District Hospital, which meant working 11 hour long days, seven days a week. After passing her examinations and became a registered nurse in December 1904 she stayed on for another year as a sister, before in 1906 she was appointed matron of Grey River Hospital. In 1908 she was appointed matron (also known as lady superintendent) of Christchurch Hospital where she proved to be a popular and capable manager. While in Christchurch took an active part in the Canterbury Trained Nurses' Association from its inception in October 1908 and subsequently became a leading member of the national association. She was president from 1914 to 1916 of the Canterbury branch Canterbury Trained Nurses' Association which required her to confront issues such as the conflict between trained and untrained nurses as well as the employment by doctors of untrained women to care for their private patients. She was responsible for ensuring the establishment of a benevolent fund to support trained nurses during periods of sickness or financial hardship. World War I In March 1915 following the resignation of Annie Tombe as matron of No. 2 New Zealand General Hospital due poor health, Thurston was offered the position and she immediately decided to accept subject to the consent of the North Canterbury Hospital and Charitable Aid Board, even though it paid little more than half of her previous salary. The board unanimously agreed to grant Thurston leave of absence with Frederick C. Horrell, chairman of the board, and Mr H. B. Sorensen, chairman of the Hospital Committee, expressing their appreciation for her service, especially in the training of nurses, and voiced the opinion that her appointment would be an honour to the hospital and the board, as well as to Miss Thurston herself. Sub-matron Sister Rose Muir was promoted to act as matron during Thurston's absence. Thurston took up her new position at the end of June 1915. On 17 August 1916 Thurston also took on the additional duties of being in charge of the New Zealand Army Nursing Service (NZANS) in the United Kingdom, until in February 1917 she was appointed Matron-in-Chief of the NZANS. At this point Fanny Wilson took over Thurston‚Äôs duties as matron at Walton-on Thames. From January 1917 she worked full time from NZEF headquarters in London. Thurston role as matron-in-chief made her responsible for NZANS nurses on active duty in the United Kingdom, France and Egypt, as well as organising the supply of nurses and Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) personnel to New Zealand‚Äôs military hospitals in the United Kingdom. Once she had seen the benefits of massage treatment she used her position as Matron-in- Chief to successfully push for the establishment of a physio-therapy school to teach New Zealand nurses in the various techniques at the New Zealand Convalescent Hospital at Hornchurch, which opened in March 1918. Inter-war At the end of August 1918 the North Canterbury Hospital and Charitable Aid Board wrote to her advising that they were terminating her employment as Matron of Christchurch Hospital as her long absence had adversely affected the hospital due to a lack of a co-ordinated nursing service. The letter also implied that the acting matron had turned down offers of other jobs in her desire to remain in the post vacated by Thurston. Thurston responded by saying that she had understood leave had been granted for the duration of the war and that she intended to return to New Zealand as soon as it ended. At a meeting of concerned citizens in Christchurch called to chastise the board for its treatment of returning war workers, comments were made about the way it was treating Mabel Thurston. Despite letters of support from Colonel William Parkes (who had been director of the New Zealand Medical Corps in the latter half of the war) and Brigadier-General George Richardson and others the board remained unmoved and terminated her appointment. In addition to paying her six months salary in lieu of notice the board also ended up paying her an additional amount of approximately ¬£166 as due to the outbreak of the war she had been unable to take up the eight months of leave of absence on full pay that they had granted her in 1914. This drew the attention of the Audit Office who requested that each member of the Hospital Board contribute to reimbursing the board as they had voted money to Thurston after she had ceased to be in the board's employ. She returned to New Zealand in January 1920 and by March of that same year had taken up the position of matron at the King George V Military Hospital at Rotorua. From February 1923 to 1924 she was matron of Queen Mary Hospital, Hanmer Springs. In 1924 she applied for the position of matron of Dunedin Hospital and director of nursing with the Otago Hospital Board and was appointed to the position on 11 September 1924. However a member of the public approached a board member and told him that she was not in the best of health and didn‚Äôt meet the board‚Äôs requirement that applicants be no more than 45 years of age, though a candidate of up to 50 years would he considered if they had special qualifications. Thurston had stated she was 49 years old on her application. The board subsequently asked for her to provide a satisfactory certificate of health and a certificate of age. Thurston declined to provide the requested certificates and withdrew her application. She was 55 years old at the time. While Dunedin had concerns about her age it didn‚Äôt stop her serving as matron at Pukeora Sanatorium in Waipukurau from 1924 to early 1927, after which she retired to England in that same year. World War II Although by now retired, she was elected to the committee of the New Zealand War Services Association when it was formed in the early days of World War II and worked as an official visitor for the association for the duration of the war. With the exception of one period when she became ill from overwork, she traveled an average of 1,000 miles a month visiting New Zealand soldiers, airmen and sailors in British hospitals during the week as well as on weekend writing letters on their behalf to their parents. Originally, she made her visits by train, carrying heavy loads of gifts until the association provided her with a car and a female driver (first, A. Bauchop and later Betty Forsyth). Thurston died in London on 23 July 1960. Personal life She never married. Honors In 1917, she was awarded the Royal Red Cross, first class. She was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1919 Birthday Honours for her services during the First World War. Thurston is honored by a stained-glass window titled \\"The Conversion of St Paul\\" in the Nurses' Memorial Chapel Christchurch. In her will she left ¬£75 to the chapel, which may have partially paid for the window. The window was commissioned by former nurses who had trained under her and by many former patients and friends. Bishop Warren dedicated the window at the Florence Nightingale service on 10 May 1964. The window shows a saint as a soldier on the road to Damascus dedicating his sword to God.

He was born in Birkenhead, Cheshire, England in 1857 and died in Auckland, New Zealand in 1937. He is best known for his early research (1880‚Äì83) into the life cycle of the sheep liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica), a distinction he shared with the German zoologist Rudolf Leuckart, his report on the eruption of Tarawera (1888) and his contribution to the development of New Zealand pedagogy.  Background and education  Thomas was born in Birkenhead, Cheshire, on 3 June 1857, the sixth child and second son of Edith Withiell Phillips (1826‚Äì1909) and her husband John Withiell Thomas (1823‚Äì1909), an accountant and, later, senior partner in the Manchester practice Thomas, Wade, Guthrie & Co.Chartered accountants in England and Wales: a guide to historical records, ed. by W Habgood (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1994), pp. 120; 203. Both his parents came from Redruth in Cornwall. His elder brother Ernest Chester Thomas, (1850‚Äì1892), a Gray's Inn barrister by profession, obtained early recognition as Librarian of the Oxford Union (1874) and, subsequently, for his work as secretary of the Library Association of the United Kingdom (1878‚Äì1890) and for his 1888 edition of The philobiblon of Richard de Bury. Two of his elder sisters, Clara Irene Thomas (1852‚Äì1919) and Lilias Landon Thomas (1854‚Äì1929), actively promoted secondary education for women, notably as foundation headmistresses respectively of Sydenham High School (1887) and Edgbaston Church of England College for Girls (1886). In 1861, Thomas' family moved to Manchester where he was educated privately before being sent as a boarder to Ockbrook School in Derby. He subsequently followed his brother to Manchester Grammar School. Inclined to scientific studies from an early age, Thomas profited from his attendance at Manchester Grammar during the regime of its reforming high master, Frederick Walker who had a reputation for ensuring that his pupils achieved the highest academic distinctions. Awarded a Brackenbury Natural Science Scholarship by Balliol College, he matriculated at Oxford on 20 October 1874, aged 17. Studying under Robert Clifton (physics), Henry Smith (mathematics), Joseph Prestwich (geology), WW Fisher (chemistry), Henry Acland (human anatomy) and George Rolleston (biology), he obtained a second in mathematical honour moderations in 1876 and a first in natural sciences in the honour finals in 1877, taking his BA in 1878. In 1879 he was awarded a Burdett-Coutts scholarship in geology, undertaking post-graduate study in Italy (Stazione Zoologica, Naples), France, Switzerland and Germany (Philipps-Universit√§t Marburg). He took his MA in 1881. In late 1879, Rolleston, the Linacre professor of anatomy and physiology, appointed Thomas junior demonstrator in human and comparative anatomy at the University Museum, Oxford, succeeding Edward Bagnall Poulton. His responsibilities included practical teaching of microscopic preparations, dissecting and practical classes in embryology as well as lecturing; his pupils included Frank Beddard (1858‚Äì1925) and Halford Mackinder (1861‚Äì1947). Under Rolleston's somewhat erratic supervision ‚Äì his health was failing ‚Äì Thomas was commissioned by the Royal Agricultural Society to investigate the sheep liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica), a parasite flatworm that in the winter of 1879‚Äì80 had caused the loss of some three million sheep in England. Thomas' preliminary results, which, critically, established the basic life cycle of the parasite, were published in 1881 and 1882, with his analysis and conclusions appearing in 1883.E B Poulton, John Viriamu Jones and other Oxford memories (London: Longmans, Green & Co, 1911), pp. 207‚Äì213. A more recent assessment is found in D Grove, A history of human helminthology (Oxford: CAB International, 1990), pp. 110‚Äì114. He was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society of London in 1882.  Emigration to New Zealand  Notwithstanding his father's relative wealth, his academic success and the overt support of Acland and the master of Balliol, Benjamin Jowett, Thomas was unclear as to where he might gain more remunerative employment subsequent to his appointment to the museum. In October 1882, flowing a number of disappointments, he applied successfully for the professorship of natural science at the soon-to-be-formed Auckland University College (AUC), a constituent college of the University of New Zealand. Selected on the recommendations of Thomas Huxley and Archibald Geikie, he delivered his first professorial lecture, 'a special discourse \\"On the Liver-parasite in Sheep\\"' alongside Acland at the University of Oxford in February 1883.H W Acland and AP Thomas, On infective and 'contagium diseases and parasites in man and animals and on the rot or parasitic liver disease in sheep (London: W Clowes & Sons, 1883). Thomas, accompanied by his younger sister Lucie Vernon Thomas (1862-1932), departed from London on 8 March 1883 on the SS Orient. Transferring to the SS Rotomahana in Melbourne, they arrived in Auckland on 1 May 1883 to find that, contrary to what Thomas had been led to believe at his interview, facilities were somewhat less than rudimentary.'The professors of the Auckland University', New Zealand Herald, vol. 20, no 6675 (10 April 1883), p. 5. Until 1885 when Parliament passed the Auckland University College Reserves Act, AUC was the only university college in New Zealand without either an endowment or a dedicated campus.http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/hist_act/aucra188549v1885n1502/ As well as having to establish a new department encompassing geology, botany and zoology in - to quote Beatrice Webb - 'quaint ramshackle wooden buildings', Thomas was also required to teach mathematics following the drowning of George Walker, the professor of mathematics.M J O'Sullivan, Algernon Phillips Withiel Thomas: educationalist, scientist, horticulturalist (Auckland: [N R W Thomas, 1968]), pp. 11‚Äì14.B Webb, The Webbs in New Zealand 1898, ed. by D Hamer (Wellington: Price Milburn, 1974), p. 22. Not only was Auckland the physical and intellectual antithesis of Oxford but there was also considerable antagonism to the very existence of the college among Auckland's dominant commercial class with the Auckland Chamber of Commerce calling for its funding to be diverted to more profitable purposes on the grounds that 'a University is for the few and that consequently its usefulness is circumscribed.'[Editorial], New Zealand Herald (24 August 1888), pp. 4‚Äì5. Aside from having to lecture and research, the scientific professorial staff were also required to locate suitable premises, assemble books, specimen, apparatus and teaching materials, establish laboratories, undertake fieldwork and, notwithstanding the absence of any support staff, administer their departments. Thomas was also elected chair of the Professorial Board and in that capacity delivered the inaugural address at the opening of AUC on 21 May 1883.University of Auckland Library, Special Collections, Thomas papers. MSS & Archives A-54, item 1/1 In addition, there was an expectation that they would also examine secondary students, give public lectures, provide reports on scientific matters to various branches of government and be active participants in the city's intellectual life. Thomas joined the Auckland Institute and Museum in June 1883, and was elected to its council in 1884 and its presidency in 1886, a position he held again in 1895 and between 1903 and 1905. In his first year of membership he delivered two lectures at the Institute: 'Remarks on specimens from the Naples Zoological Station' and 'Remarks on Mr Caldwell's researches on the development of the lower mammals of Australia' and for the next decade he continued to deliver up to three lectures a year. Subsequently, he was appointed chairman of the Trustees of the Museum and, in that position, played a significant role both in establishing the museum's scientific reputation and in ensuring it was suitably housed and maintained. In the summer vacation following his arrival, between January and March 1884, Thomas travelled throughout New Zealand meeting colleagues at the other two university establishments, notably Thomas Jeffery Parker (1850‚Äì1897), professor of biology and curator of the University Museum at the University of Otago and Frederick Hutton (1836‚Äì1905), professor of biology at Canterbury University College. The visit both enabled him to assess the status of science in the country and provided him with the empirical basis on which he developed a teaching programme best suited to the needs of his students. It also opened up an informal network of local scientific researchers; he became particularly close to Parker with whom he initiated a research project focussing on the embryology of the Tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus).A P W Thomas, 'Preliminary note on development of Tuatara', Proceedings of the Royal Society, London, vol. 48 (1890), p. 152. While Thomas had good relations with his peers, his connection with the New Zealand scientific establishment, as embodied by James Hector, director of both the Colonial Museum and the New Zealand Geological Survey, manager of the New Zealand Institute and editor of its Transactions, was less congenial. Hector seems to have avoided meeting Thomas during his first visit to Wellington, leaving Thomas to observe merely that the Colonial Museum was 'old-fashioned' in appearance.Auckland War Memorial Museum Library, Ms 304/2 The influential Hector, a medical doctor by training, distrusted university- trained natural scientists recently arrived from the metropolis, such as Thomas and Parker. It was a view shared by James McKerrow, the surveyor general and a prot√©g√© of Hector's, who observed of Thomas and his colleague Frederick Douglas Brown, the professor of chemistry at AUC, that 'They are I fancy like some other learned men I have seen from Home, who have to unlearn a good deal after they come to the colony, and get quit of a deal of self- complacency. A very common notion of new arrivals, is, that Colonials are a sort of unkempt inferior race which it is the privilege and duty of them ‚Äì the learned men ‚Äì to make stepping stones of.'Letter from L McKerrow to S P Smith, cited in R F Keam, Tarawera: the volcanic eruption of 10 June 1886 (Auckland, R F Keam, 1988), p. 331. For their part, Parker, Thomas and Brown were not so much keen to step on 'colonials', but rather unimpressed by the descriptive, unanalytical, nature of the prevailing scientific methodology and sceptical of the rigour of its practitioners, many of them self-trained. Hector's animus against the academic scientists is suggested by his failure to publish many of the papers submitted to him in his capacity as editor of the Transactions and Proceedings of the New Zealand Institute.Report of the Auckland Institute and Museum (1888‚Äì89), p. 7. These tensions coalesced in June 1886 when the largest volcanic event in modern New Zealand history occurred at Mount Tarawera, 24 kilometres south east of Rotorua in the North Island. Following the eruption, the government commissioned Hector to provide a scientific report on the occurrence and its consequences. Undertaking a fleeting visit around the site he produced a report arguing that the eruption was, essentially, non-volcanic and of little scientific interest. As R F Keam remarks, 'No geologist today would accept Hector's model of the occurrence' and, even then, the deficiencies of the Hector report aroused criticism. In an effort to defuse the matter William Lanarch, the minister of mines, commissioned Hutton, Thomas and Brown to further report on the eruption. While Hutton evinced a degree of impatience in promulgating his opinion, Thomas was more circumspect and thorough in his fieldwork and his report, published two years later and separately from that of Hutton, was, in Keam's opinion, 'the polished product of meticulous research'; he further notes that 'Thomas would have been glad that he had distanced himself from Hutton's ideas on the matter'.Keam, op. cit., p. 334.  Research and teaching  Notwithstanding the topicality of and his interest in geological matters, the wide scope of Thomas's academic responsibilities made it impossible for him to specialise. Almost immediately after his arrival he was requested by both colonial and municipal authorities to undertake investigations into a diverse range of biological and geological subjects ranging from parasitic diseases affecting rabbits in the Wairarapa district and the life history of flounder to analyses of water quality in Auckland. In a discussion of Thomas' report on the rabbit control problem, Paul Star notes that while he 'did not find a satisfactory disease, ... the publication of his reports introduced many colonists to a scientific approach'.P. Star, '\\"Nature's trump card\\": confronting the rabbit problem in southern New Zealand, 1867‚Äì1897', Environment and Nature in New Zealand, vol. 1, no. 2 (2006), 3‚Äì9, p. 8. Thomas' lack of specialisation has led some New Zealand historians, such as Keith Sinclair, to assert that he was not a researcher of any significance.K Sinclair, A history of the University of Auckland (Auckland: Auckland University Press, 1983), pp. 82‚Äì83. Much of this argument is anachronistic and demonstrates a failure either to comprehend the aims, purpose and function of applied scientific research at the end of the nineteenth century or to understand the circumstances under which Thomas would have been able to research at the level he had become accustomed to in Europe. Nonetheless, Thomas did produce significant research outputs, particularly during his first two decades at the university; between 1883 and 1903 he published thirteen scientific papers ranging in scope from observations on volcanic rocks of the Taupo district, notes on Tuatara embryology and an account of the prothallium of Phylloglossum. Although not present for the preliminary meeting of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) held in Sydney in November 1886 he was a foundation member and in 1888 was elected an ordinary member of the Association's ruling body and, with Parker, Honorary Local Secretary for New Zealand. At the AAAS conference held in Melbourne in 1890 he presided over the biological section, delivering an address lamenting the deficient state of scientific pedagogy, particularly at secondary level, the need for public scientific research and the failure of museums in some of the Australasian colonies to recognise their public role noting that 'It is over 30 years since Darwin pointed out how important and intimate were the relations of living beings to their environment. His teaching infused new life into the study of Biology but the enthusiasm does not seem to have extended to museums. One would think that the Origin of Species had never entered the doors of a museum. Most museums seem to be arranged chiefly, though most inadequately, with regard to the wants of the specialist, and the general public are scarcely thought of.A P W Thomas, 'Presidential address ‚Äì section 4 biology' in Report of the second meeting of the Australasian Association of Science, ed by W Baldwin Spencer (Sydney: the Association, 1890), 100-109, p. 104. It was, effectively, a statement of what Thomas hoped to achieve in his work in New Zealand. Tuatara and their eggs raised by Algernon Thomas in his Auckland 'lizard house', about 1890. Thomas' primary focus at AUC was on teaching and his research clearly informed his pedagogy. While University of New Zealand degrees were initially set and examined in the United Kingdom, he developed courses in both biology and geology that focussed on the local condition and emphasised fieldwork. His early students effectively developed those areas in which he had undertaken preliminary research. Thomas appears to have been an inspiring teacher. Alan Mason notes with respect to his teaching of geology that he was responsible 'for an explosion of talent, noting that of the six senior scholars in geology between 1894 and 1903, five of them were from Auckland. Moreover, 'the Auckland achievement becomes even greater when we realise that of the three colleges in existence ... the Auckland college was the smallest and the poorest. The success came from a student base of less than forty i.e. an average of four first year students entering the department each year. Furthermore, in contrast to his southern counterparts, Thomas was the sole teacher of botany, zoology and geology.'A Mason, 'The golden years of Auckland University geology', Geological Society of New Zealand Historical Studies Group Newsletter, no. 16 (1998), 29‚Äì36, p. 29. Thomas's success as a teacher was not restricted to geology. His zoology students included Richard William Allen, MA (1899), Wooldridge Memorial Scholar in Physiology (1902) at Guys Hospital, gold medalist material medica, University of London (1902), Gull student in pathology (1904), MB BS University of London (1905), who became 'a brilliant Harley Street specialist' and author of Vaccine therapy; its theory and practice (1910). In botany, John Ernest Holloway FRS, MSc (1905), DSc (1917) developed and extended Thomas's initial investigation into primitive ferns; and Kathleen Maisey Curtis, BA (1913) was the first New Zealand woman to win an 1851 Scholarship for study at the University of London where she was awarded a DSc in 1919. A mycologist at the Cawthorn Institute in Nelson, she was the first female fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand. Other students who distinguishing themselves included Elsie Mary Griffin, MA (1906), subsequently a key figure in the YWCA in both New Zealand and Australia. Writing to Thomas in 1912, Griffin observed that while he might think her 'a horrid \\"suffragette\\"' indulging in 'all kinds of bold & \\"unwomanly\\" things', she found her 'scientific training of immense value' in her work.Thomas Papers, letter from E M Griffin to A P W Thomas, 14 June 1912.  Conservation and horticulture  Thomas' pragmatic approach to his teaching anticipated the development of an understanding of New Zealand's natural environment based on scientific method rather than on the fragmented observation of phenomena. Moreover, Thomas was not averse to criticising the focus of the British-set examinations conducted under the aegis of the University of New Zealand, arguing for example with A H Green, Prestwich's successor as professor of geology at Oxford, that while a general knowledge of British geology was useful for New Zealand students of the subject, the focus should be on the geology of their country.University of Auckland Library, Special Collections, A-54/1/1, letter from [A H] Green to A P W Thomas, 19 February 1890. Thomas' recognition of the unique qualities of New Zealand biota paved the way for his advocacy of environmental conservation measures; while far from being the first to propose the preservation of the country's indigenous fauna and flora, his methodological approach laid the foundation for more scientific assessments of what had hitherto been proposed for preservation on the basis of 'natural curiosities'. As early as 1886 he was among those arguing at the Auckland Institute the necessity of introducing measures to conserve the rapidly diminishing indigenous bird population.'Auckland Institute', Auckland Star (17 November 1886), p. 6. In 1891, Thomas moved a resolution at the Christchurch meeting of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science, seconded by G M Thomson, encouraging the preservation of the native fauna and flora of New Zealand. His motion declared the need for 'the formation of one or more Reserves where the fauna (and also the flora) could be protected from the destruction which, it is well known, is overtaking so many of the rare and more interesting species'.A P W Thomas, 'The preservation of the native fauna and flora of New Zealand', New Zealand Journal of Science, 2nd series, col. 1, no. 2 (1891), p. 93. After considerable legislative inertia, his lobbying led to the formation of a conservation reserve on Hauturu-o-Toi (Little Barrier Island) in October 1894 'as a reserve for birds in time of peace, and for defence purposes in time of fighting'.New Zealand. Parliament. Legislative Council, New Zealand Parliamentary Debates (1894) vol. 86, p. 974. In April 1894, emboldened by the success of this move, he advocated the preservation of the native flora and fauna of the nearby WaitƒÅkere Ranges and subsequently was the chief speaker in a delegation that sought to persuade the Auckland City Council to acquire the region as a scenic reserve.'The Waitakerei Bush: a scheme to preserve it', Auckland Star (3 April 1894), p. 2. He was supporter and later chairman of the Auckland Scenery Preservation Society (1899), one of the earliest conservation pressure groups in the country.'Scenery preservation society', Auckland Star (1 August 1899), p. 2. View of the pond garden at Trewithiel, Algernon Thomas' Auckland property, about 1935. Algernon Thomas' design for a rock garden at the entrance to the new Auckland Grammar School building, about 1916. On taking up his appointment at AUC, Thomas initiated a scheme where, in the absence of any such facility in Auckland, the college grounds ‚Äì such as they were ‚Äì would be developed as a precursor botanical garden of indigenous flora. This engagement with applied science prompted an interest in horticulture and in 1890 he acquired a denuded ten acre (4 hectares) section in the Auckland suburb of Epsom which he and his wife Emily developed into an extensive garden while retaining its key geological feature, a remnant lava field of the nearby Maungawhau volcanic cone. Thomas designed a garden that with its winding paths, lookouts and naturalistic arrangement, while echoing the form and structure of gardens he had observed in southern Italy during his 1879 visit, was planted primarily with New Zealand flora. It seems probable that this was among the first pakeha gardens to employ indigenous flora as the dominant feature of a horticultural landscape. Thomas' initiative in reintroducing indigenous planting was emulated by a number of his neighbours, such as the surgeon Sir Carrick Robertson and the businessman Sir William Goodfellow, and encouraged the preservation of the remnant Almorah lava forest, named for a nearby street.M Smale and R Gardner, 'Survival of Mount Eden bush, an urban forest remnant in Auckland, New Zealand', Pacific Conservation Biology (1999), vol. 5, pp. 83‚Äì93; E K Cameron, 'Mt Eden rock forests, Auckland city', Auckland Botanical Society Journal (1999), vol. 54, pp. 46‚Äì53. Thomas was also responsible for designing the grounds of the nearby Auckland Grammar School (1916) and, most probably, was involved in the design of the grounds of Auckland's other grammar schools. As a development of his interest in applied botany, Thomas also became interested in the hybridisation of daffodils for which he gained both local and international recognition.G L Wilson, 'Our frontispiece: Sir Algernon Thomas', The Daffodil Yearbook (1938), vol. 9, pp. 1‚Äì2.  Educational developments  From the time of his arrival in Auckland, Thomas evinced a particular interest in educational issues outside of his college responsibilities. He was keenly interested in technical education matters, notably agricultural science. In 1888 he addressed these issue in a series of provocative lectures and articles published in newspapers throughout the country in which he argued that given its dependence on mining and agriculture, New Zealand could only benefit from the proper teaching of agricultural botany and chemistry at primary, secondary and tertiary levels. His articles in the New Zealand Herald suggest both an awareness of the work of Arthur Acland's educational reform lobby group, the National Association for the Promotion of Technical and Secondary Education and a recognition that this work had significant relevance to New Zealand. The association was an Oxford creation ‚Äì Acland himself was an honorary fellow of Balliol College ‚Äì and many of those involved with it had served as lecturers with the university extension programme at Toynbee Hall in London's East End. In a statement that retains contemporary significance, Thomas opined that 'The true way ... to protect the interests of the working classes is to afford them opportunities of acquiring such knowledge and skill as will enable them to hold their own in competition with the rest of the world.'A Thomas, 'Technical education, no 1', New Zealand Herald (20 July 1888), p. 6. Perhaps surprisingly given its conservative ideology, the Herald editorialised its support for Thomas' progressive proposals, observing that 'Professor Thomas is distinctly of the present and of the future, as indeed his colleagues are, and it is on the fact that our professors have thoroughly caught the temper of the times, and have brought themselves in touch with the onward spirit of colonial life, that the best hopes are based that our University institutions will prove to be the most influential and valuable of our educational agencies.'[Editorial], New Zealand Herald (14 August 1888), p. 4. He also initiated a series of lectures on agricultural science at the AUC specifically aimed at teachers and farmers. For some years after, in the absence of any official activity, he provided advice and delivered lectures on agricultural matters to a wide range of agricultural organisations throughout the country.For example, the lectures he delivered at Cambridge, Te Awamutu and Hamilton in March 1890. See: 'Science lectures', Auckland Star (5 March 1890), p. 4. Thomas, along with Brown, was also behind an ultimately successful move to establish a school of mines at AUC in 1906. By 1910 the AUC school had morphed into what Sinclair describes as 'a covert School of Engineering', a move that despite opposition from the University of New Zealand became official in 1923.Sinclair, op. cit., pp. 112‚Äì117. Thomas's educational concerns prompted his appointment to the Auckland Grammar School Board in 1899, chaired by George Maurice O'Rourke who was also chairman of the AUC council. He was immediately elected vice-chairman and, in 1916, chairman. Thomas' chairmanship of the board coincided with the last six years of James Tibbs' long period as headmaster of Auckland Grammar School. The younger Thomas had been a contemporary of Tibbs at Oxford and, given that both took mathematics honours, they were probably acquainted. But where Tibbs chafed under the provisions of the 1914 Education Act, Thomas seems to have relished the opportunity it provided to develop the Grammar Schools as intellectual powerhouses. Under Thomas' dominant influence the Board expanded the number of schools under its control from one, housed on an inadequate inner-city site, to five, all housed in new, well-equipped premises: Auckland Girls' Grammar School (1909); Auckland Grammar School (1915); Epsom Girls' Grammar School (1917); Mt Albert Grammar School (1922); and Takapuna Grammar School (1927). In contrast to his successors as chair of the Auckland Grammar School Board, Thomas played a highly visible role in the activities of the schools until his death. He was a vice-chairman of the Dilworth Trust Board, the body responsible for Dilworth School, between 1906 and 1937 and a member of the Auckland Teachers' Training College Committee of Advice between 1906 and 1914. Thomas was a member of the Senate of the University of New Zealand between 1899 and 1903 and, again, between 1921 and 1933. He was also a member of the AUC council between 1919 and 1925. He was the Bishop of Waiapu's nominated member of the St John's Theological College Board of Governors between 1910 and 1911.  Public science  In October 1913, a newly elected Reform government introduced legislation into the New Zealand Parliament creating a governmental scientific advisory body, the Board of Science and Art.New Zealand. Parliament, Board of Science and Art Act, 1913. Ross Galbreath asserts that the government intended that the board's primary function was to manage the Dominion (formerly Colonial) Museum and to publish scientific journals and reports, but its members appear to have had greater ambitions.R Galbreath, DSIR: making science work for New Zealand (Wellington: Victoria University Press, 1998), p. 13. Along with six others, Thomas was appointed to the board by an Order in Council in 1915. He appears to have played a significant role in galvanising its activities, notably in calling for 'a central advisory board' for science and industry.M Hoare, 'The Board of Science and Art 1913‚Äì30: a precursor to the DSIR' in In search of New Zealand's scientific heritage, ed. by M Hoare and L Bell (Wellington: Royal Society of New Zealand, 1984), 25‚Äì48, p. 35. But early moves to establish a scientific advisory body modelled on the British Department of Scientific and Industrial Research failed due to the absence of any significant political support. It was only with the visit in 1926 of Frank Heath, permanent secretary of the British DSIR, along with a decision by the British Empire Marketing Board to fund agricultural research in New Zealand, that a body to advise on the promotion of science in industry, also known as the DSIR, was formed.(Henry) Frank Heath (1863‚Äì1946) advised on the formation of the British DSIR in 1914 and in 1916 was appointed its first permanent secretary. In 1925 he was invited by the Australian federal government to advise on the formation of a similar body and he subsequently undertook a similar process in New Zealand although this was largely based on a report prepared by the Board of Science and Art. Heath was accompanied on his visit from Australia by Edward Sievers (1864‚Äì1932), formerly valuer general of NSW, and Thomas' brother-in- law. See: Thomas papers, letter from E J Sievers to A P W Thomas, 5 February 1926.  Personal life  Notwithstanding the suggestion of Francis Dillon Bell, the New Zealand Agent General in London 'that a Mrs Professor would be a very great addition to the colony', Thomas arrived in New Zealand a bachelor although there are indications he had an unsuccessful shipboard romance on the outward voyage. He was accompanied by his younger sister Lucie Vernon Thomas (1862‚Äì1932) who would act as his hostess and housekeeper until February 1885. Soon after his arrival, he purchased a villa at Narrow Neck on Auckland's North Shore. On 19 November 1887 he married Emily Sarah Nolan Russell (1867‚Äì1950), the third of six daughters of Mary Ann Nolan (1834‚Äì1931) and her husband John Benjamin Russell (1834‚Äì1894), an Auckland solicitor. The Russells were a well-connected Auckland family: J B Russell's practice, Russell & Campbell, was ‚Äì and, as Russell McVeagh, remains ‚Äì one of Auckland's leading legal firms; his eldest brother was the lawyer, politician and financier Thomas Russell. Emily Thomas was a well-educated, travelled, woman of progressive ideas; in 1895 she was nominated unsuccessfully by the Auckland, Devonport and Ponsonby Schools Committees for a seat on the Auckland Education Board. Unfortunately in 1905 and, again, in 1908 she experienced a specific acute reactive disorder that led to her being admitted to Ashburn Hall, a private asylum in Dunedin. She remained there until March 1950 when she was transferred to Kingseat Hospital near Auckland, shortly before her death. Thomas, a lifelong cigarette smoker, died suddenly in Auckland on 28 December 1937. The Thomases had four children: three sons, Acland Withiel (1888‚Äì1962), Norman Russell Withiel (1891‚Äì1969), Arthur Edward Withiel (1904‚Äì1992); and a daughter, Mary Wynfrida Withiel (1893‚Äì1974).  Honours  Besides being a fellow of the Linnean Society of London (FLS, 1882), Thomas was a fellow of the Geological Society (FGS, 1888), a fellow of the New Zealand Institute (1905), and after its transmogrification from an Institute into a royal society, an original fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand, (FRSNZ, 1919) and an honorary fellow of the New Zealand Institute of Horticulture (1936). Following his resignation from the chair of biology and geology at Auckland University College in 1913 he was made professor emeritus by the college senate. He was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal in 1935.https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP19350506.2.12 In the 1937 George VI Coronation Honours Thomas was made Knight Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) for services to education, a then extraordinary distinction for a New Zealander.https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/34396/supplement/3082 Pallbearers at his funeral included the Hon Peter Fraser, minister of education and later prime minister in the first Labour administration.http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi- bin/paperspast?a=d&cl;=search&d;=NZH19371231.2.134&srpos;=17&e;=--1937---1938 --10--11----0professor+thomas+KCMG-- The Austrian naturalist and explorer Andreas Reischek named New Zealand's westernmost lake in Fiordland (45¬∞59'14.3\\"S 166¬∞30'09.8\\"E) after Thomas in 1887.A.

See: http://rsnz.natlib.govt.nz/volume/rsnz_20/rsnz_20_00_006830.html Following his death, the executors of his estate gifted 100 acres (42 hectares) of land at Piha to the Auckland City Council; this was supplemented in 1963 by the gift of Lion Rock (Te Piha), an eroded 16-million-year-old volcanic neck, that was acquired by two of his sons, Acland and Norman, from Te Kawerau in 1941.http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi- bin/paperspast?a=d&cl;=search&d;=AS19380202.2.78.1&srpos;=18&e;=--1937---1938 --10--11----0professor+thomas+KCMG-- These gifts were commemorated in 2008 with the naming of a part of the gift as the Sir Algernon Thomas Green. In 1968, largely on the initiative of Sir Douglas Robb, chancellor of the University of Auckland, the university's new biological sciences building was named in his honour. Following the subdivision of his garden, a road formed through the property (primarily through what had been his 'cow paddock') was named Withiel Drive in his memory, as was a 0.7 hectare reserve donated to the Auckland City Council in 1949 by his son Norman, which was based on a remnant of the Maungawhau lava field that he had preserved, Withiel Thomas Park.

Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. Chuck Taylor made the first boys' high school basketball All-American selections in 1949. The ESPN RISE boys' high school basketball All-American (2009-2011), formerly EA Sports boys' high school basketball All-American (2005-2008) and Student Sports boys' high school basketball All-American (1989-2004) is an annual honorary list that includes twenty first team All-American selections of the best high school basketball players for a given season. Each season the team is determined by the ESPN HS staff based solely on high school accomplishment, regardless of professional potential. A second team of thirty additional players is also chosen. Additionally, a single person has been recognized as Mr. Basketball USA since 1996. This is considered to be one of the four current major boys' high school basketball All-American teams along with the Parade All-America and USA Today All-USA high school basketball teams, which are chosen after each season, as well as the preseason Street & Smith All- American team. Student Sports Magazine's executive editor Mark Tennis began overseeing All-America selections by the magazine in 1989, with a process that also chooses All-American teams by class (seniors, juniors, sophomores and freshmen).

Music career Falco's professional musical career began in 1996 with the band Best. After a few line-up changes and release of a 3-track single Huwuno on London-based label Seriously Groovy, Best changed its name to Mclusky in 1999. The line-up consisted of Falco fronting the band, serving as its main songwriter along with Mat Harding on drums and Jon Chapple on bass/backing vocals. Falco and Mclusky released its first album My Pain and Sadness is More Sad and Painful Than Yours in 2000 on the Fuzzbox imprint before drawing international attention with their critically praised second album Mclusky Do Dallas in 2002. Harding left the group in 2003 with Falco telling The Telegraph \\"It was due to differences on just about every imaginable level ‚Äì personal, musical and professional.\\". Mclusky recruited drummer Jack Egglestone for their 2004 album The Difference Between Me and You Is That I'm Not on Fire. On 7 January 2005, Mclusky announced its break-up. Falco released this announcement on the band's website on three days later: :The three piece rock band known as mclusky have disbanded, as of Friday 7 January 2005. The reason for this parting is private, though probably not as entertaining as you'd imagine. Personally, I would like to thank all the people, places and times that occurred on or near us. I'm grateful for the love and to a lesser degree, the hate. There'll be more music soon, from all of us. Little was said of the reasons behind Mclusky's split, but it later emerged that tensions had arisen between Falco and Chapple. Falco did not stay silent for long, in 2006, he announced the formation of Future Of The Left with Mclusky drummer Jack Egglestone and former Jarcrew frontman Kelson Mathias assuming bass duties. Their first release was a single, \\"Fingers Become Thumbs\\". It came out to minimal fanfare but paved the way for their first CD release Curses on Too Pure Records in September 2007. They followed-up with Travels With Myself And Another on June 2009 on 4AD. NME ranked Future of the Left's 2009 live album Last Night I Saved Her from Vampires at No. 42 on their list of 50 Greatest Live Records of all Time. and Pedestrian TV calling Future of the Left one of the greatest live bands of all time. In a 2010 interview with NME Falco stated that Mathias was no longer in the band and bassist Julia Ruzicka (also his then girlfriend, now wife) and guitarist Jimmy Watkins have joined the group as a quartet. In late 2011, the band announced they signed to Xtra Mile Records and released the EP Polymers Are Forever and the album The Plot Against Common Sense. In 2013, the band released the album How to Stop Your Brain in an Accident and in 2016 they released the album The Peace and Truce of Future of the Left. In 2014, Falco released an album under the moniker Christian Fitness titled I Am Scared of Everything That Isn't Me, and in 2015 the follow-up album, Love Letters in the Age of Steam. Christian Fitness's third album, This Taco Is Not Correct, was released on Bandcamp on 12 September 2016. A title revealed on an appearance on Conan Neutron's Protonic Reversal to be random placeholder text from the designer (Aesthetic Apparatus) that he felt made a fitting title. \\"...that appealed to me that (the random text) would become meaningful and the silhouetted angel is pondering something that is ridiculous, racked with anguish over nothing. As much as all value tacos in their correct context, it just seemed perfect\\". Christian Fitness's fourth album, Slap Bass Hunks, was released - also via Bandcamp and the label Prescriptions Music, on 19 April 2017. Falco vs. illegal music downloading Falco became a surprise player in the debate over illegal musical file sharing when the second Future of the Left album Travels With Myself And Another was leaked online in late April 2009, more than two months before its official release. Falco took to the web and released a seething open letter to those that chose to leak the album, stated that continuing to illegally share music will make it harder for legitimate musicians to continue to make music. In his letter, Falco stated: :Please be careful, or we'll get the world we all deserve. Hobby bands who can tour once every few years if they're lucky, and the superstars, freed from such inconvenient baggage as integrity and conscience, running the corporate sponsored marathon of ¬£80-a-ticket arena tours and television adverts til their loveless hearts explode in an orgy of oppressive branding and self-regard. Some of us, in all honestly, just want to make the music we love and play it around the world without living in poverty. UK Music decided to take out a full-page advert in The Guardian, reprinting Falco's letter making him an advocate for bands and sparking further debate on behalf of artists. Later, in an interview during a 2011 Australian tour, Falco stated that his \\"problem comes when people try to say it's a fight against the oppressor\\", a mentality of sticking it to some faceless entity. He continued to say he's encountered people complaining about paying money to see a band and the cost of an album, but would then turn around and spend more money on a round of drinks at the show.

A soft-drink bottler in the state of Oregon for nearly six decades, Pastega was elected to the Beverage World Hall of Fame in 2002. Pastega is best remembered as a patron of education and as the funder and namesake of the Mario Pastega House, a hostel in Corvallis, Oregon offering low cost or free accommodations to families of hospitalized patients in that town.  Biography  Early years Mario Pastega was born 12 December 1916 in Weed, California. He was the son of a cobbler named Romano Pastega and his wife, the former Giuseppina Cunial, who worked as a maid.Ed Langlois, \\"Going Like a House on Fire,\\" The Catholic Sentinel, www.catholicsentinel.org/ 19 August 2011. His parents emigrated from a town in the Italian Alps to the United States in 1907, eventually making their way west to open up a shoe repair shop in Weed. Mario worked for his father in the shoe repair store from the age of 12. Pastega grew up in the home speaking Italian as his first language, learning English only after being enrolled in school in Weed. Pastega was raised a Roman Catholic and remained an active member of the Catholic Church throughout his life. Pastega trained as a legal transcriptionist, working variously as a court clerk and court reporter, taking trial transcriptions.Elizabeth Uriarte, \\"Mario Pastega: Owner of Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. Believes, 'If Life has been good to you, you have to give something back,\\" Winners Within Us, winnerswithinus.com/ 15 June 2007. Pastega married the former Alma Solari (1917‚Äì2008) in April 1938.Michael Booth, \\"Corvallis Philanthropist Alma Pastega Dies at Age 90,\\" Albany Democrat-Herald, 24 February 2008. Together the couple raised five children. The couple's three sons each followed their father into the soda bottling business, each managing one of the company's three plants. Career In 1948 Pastega began his ultimate career path when he purchased a half share in the Pepsi-Cola bottling plant of Klamath Falls, Oregon from his wife's brother.Bennett Hall, \\"Pastega Never Quit Working for Community He Loved,\\" Corvallis Gazette-Times, 21 January 2012, pp. A1, A4. The Pastega family remained in that Southern Oregon town until 1961, when the family's bottling empire was expanded through purchase of the Pepsi-Cola bottling plant in Corvallis, Oregon. Pastega and his family subsequently moved to Corvallis to manage that facility. Pastega subsequently sold his share of the Klamath Falls bottling operation and used the proceeds to purchase additional Pepsi bottling plants in the Oregon towns of Tillamook and Medford. In the early 1980s, Pastega launched a new business, the Mount Angel Beverage Company, in Mount Angel, Oregon. Over the course of his life Pastega personally met every president in the history of the Pepsi-Cola Company. In December 2010 Pepsi CEO Donald M. Kendall flew to Oregon to attend Pastega's 94th birthday celebration. In 2002 Pastega was honored by election to membership in the Beverage World Hall of Fame for his career efforts in the soft drink bottling industry.\\"About Mario Pastega,\\" Samaritan Health Services, www.samhealth.org/ Philanthropic efforts Beginning in 1980 Pastega turned the Corvallis Pepsi bottling plant into a community landmark each winter through its extravagant decoration with Christmas lights. The display, which included a number of mechanized characters, was created by Ole Brensdal, a career employee at Pastega's Corvallis facility. The display has been an annual tradition for over three decades, save for one year when the plant was closed for construction. Although Pastega sold the bottling company in the spring of 2011 to the Pepsi Beverages Co. of Westchester County, New York, continuation of the now-traditional Christmas display which Pastega launched was preserved.Bennett Hall, \\"Pastega Selling Pepsi Plant,\\" Corvallis Gazette- Times, 20 April 2011. \\"That's part of the contract ‚Äì thou shalt keep it open every year. That's a guarantee,\\" Pastega said at the time of sale. Pastega became a trustee of the Good Samaritan Hospital Foundation in 1981. In this capacity he headed several seven-figure fundraising drives for hospital expansion projects. In 2004 Pastega became the major benefactor and chief fundraiser for the Mario Pastega House, an endowed 12-room guest hostel for out-of-town family members of patients receiving treatment at Good Samaritan Hospital. In addition to the rooms, 3 full service RV hook ups are available. Those needing use of the facility may stay at it for $20 per night, a fee waived for those in financial need. During the facility's first five years of operations it provided accommodations equivalent to 26,164 motel rooms.Kyle Odegard, \\"Pastega House Celebrates Fifth Year,\\" Corvallis Gazette-Times, 20 September 2009. In addition to his leading role in ongoing fundraising campaigns on behalf of the project, Pastega and his wife personally gave between $500,000 and $600,000 to the project over the years. Pastega was also a trustee of the Oregon State University Foundation as well as a founding trustee of the Corvallis Public Schools Foundation, established in 1996. As a donor he endowed the Golden Apple Awards, presented each year to three of the Corvallis School District's teachers and one member of the district's staff. Pastega and his late wife Alma also created and endowed the Mario and Alma Pastega Awards, awards for exceptional scholarship granted each year to two deserving members of the faculty of Western Oregon University in Monmouth, Oregon.\\"Faculty and Staff Recognized for Outstanding Commitment and Dedication to WOU,\\" Western Oregon University, www.wou.edu/ 10 June 2009. Pastega also sponsored a student award program for students at Mount Angel Abbey. Death and legacy Mario Pastega died 20 January 2012 at Overlake Hospital in Bellevue, Washington following a month-long battle with pneumonia. Pastega's philanthropic efforts were recognized in 2004 when Pastega received the Oregon Philanthropy Award and in 2009 when he received the Oregon Ethics in Business Award.

Early Life Cook was born on February 5, 1856, in Salt Lake City, Utah to John and Margaretta Gratrix Cook. Her mother, Margaretta, left her father due to his stinginess and his belief in polygamy. In 1870, Eliza, her mother, and Eliza‚Äôs sister Rebecca moved to Sheridan, Nevada. Without a school to attend, Eliza was educated by her mother and whatever books she could find. One book, the title of which is unknown, was about home remedies and got her interested in medicine.  Medical Career  A doctor, H. W. Smith, hired Cook to help nurse his wife when she had puerperal fever. Cook‚Äôs skills impressed him so much that he hired her as his assistant. This gave her access to his medical library, where she read everything she could. Cook received her Medical Degree in 1884 from Cooper Medical College in San Francisco, and her Nevada medical license in April 1899, the first year that they were issued by the state. As a doctor, she performed surgeries, set broken limbs, and delivered many babies. She also worked as a pharmacist and wrote articles about health issues for magazines and medical journals.  Women's Suffrage  Cook was a member of the American Woman Suffrage Association and the Women's Christian Temperance Union. She served as Vice President of the Nevada Equal Suffrage Association. Never married, she resided in Mottsville, Carson Valley, and Douglas County. Cook died on October 2, 1947.

Life Moroi was self-taught in composition while studying at the Tokyo Imperial University before moving in 1932 to Germany to study in the Berlin Musikhochschule under Leo Schrattenholz and Walter Gmeindl. While Moroi had been active in the Tokyo musical scene, forming with other colleagues a society named Surya, he claimed that his creative life truly started from his Berlin days. Returning to Japan in 1934, he built a successful career in subsequent years. His work was part of the music event in the art competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics. Soon after completing his Symphony No. 3 in 1944 he was called up by the Japanese Army to serve in the Pacific War. Following the country's surrender he focused on teaching and writing books on music theory, composing just eight works in the following three decades, including two more symphonies. In his last works he turned to the twelve-tone system. Pupils of Moroi include Ikuma Dan, Toriro Miki, Toshiharu Ichikawa (Â∏ÇÂ∑ùÈÉΩÂøóÊò•), Yoshir≈ç Irino, Kunio Toda (Êà∏Áî∞ÈÇ¶ÈõÑ), Minao Shibata, S≈çkichi Ozaki (Â∞æÂ¥éÂÆóÂêâ), Akio Yashiro and Ch≈´ji Kinoshita (Êú®‰∏ãÂø†Âè∏).

They were the most successful of the publishers of \\"Canadian Whites\\", and published comics such as Adrian Dingle's Nelvana of the Northern Lights. Founded in 1939 as a commercial art business, the company found success when it started publishing comics in September 1941, and changed its name to Bell Features in 1942. It folded in 1953 under increasing competition from American publishers. History Brothers Gene and Cy Bell ran a commercial art business in Toronto called Commercial Signs of Canada. They had previously been approached by Edmund Legault, who was looking for a publishing outlet for his comic books. When the War Exchange Conservation Act passed in December 1940, the importation of American comic books was cut off. Cy Bell saw an opportunity and contacted Legault. With capital invested by John Ezrin, the result was Wow Comics in September 1941 a colour comic which soon switched to the black-and-white format common at the time that became known amongst collectors as \\"Canadian Whites\\". More titles were added, including Active, Commando, Dime, The Funny Comics and Joke. The comics initially carried the Commercial Signs label, but switched to labeling them as Bell Features in 1942. In April 1942, the company picked up Adrian Dingle from his own Hillborough Studios. He brought with him most of the Hillborough staff, as well as his popular Nelvana of the Northern Lights, one of the earliest female superheroes in North America, who was inspired by Inuit legends. Canada's second superhero, Leo Bachle's Johnny Canuck, appeared in Dime Comics #1 in February 1942. Bachle had been spotted by Ezrin in late 1941, when he was 16. Ezrin asked for Bachle's opinion on the Bell comics he was browsing, and Bachle was critical of them. Ezrin challenged him to draw two men fighting, and the results were impressive enough that Ezrin invited him to come up with a character and bring it to the Bell offices the next day. Johnny Canuck was a hit, and Bachle's talents were considerable enough that he was snatched up by New York publishers in 1944. Johnny Canuck's serial adventures continued with art by Andr√© Kulbach and Paul Dak. Other characters that were popular for the company were another Dingle creation called the Penguin (no relation to the Batman villain), Legault's Dixon of the Mounted, Jerry Lazare's Phantom Rider, Edmond Good's Rex Baxter, and Fred Kelly's Doc Stearne. Bell was the most prolific of the Canadian publishers, issuing nearly twenty titles, and its comics were a big success, achieving combined weekly sales of 100,000 copies by the end of 1943. Bell provided work for over fifty freelance creators, including Ren√© Kulbach, Ted Steele, Manny Easson, Jack Tremblay, Mel Crawford, Lou Skuce, Doris Slater and Patricia Joudrey. After the war ended in 1945, trade restrictions were loosened, and American comics once again flooded the Canadian market. With better distribution, colour interiors and glossy covers, Canadian publishers found it hard to compete in such a small market. Nelvana's last issue came out in 1947, and Bell ceased operations in 1953.

The courthouse and adjacent annex are designated a Michigan State Historic Site. , the courthouse operates courtrooms for the 12th Circuit Court, 97th District Court, and Baraga County Probate Court. History On February 19, 1875, Baraga County was established with L'Anse as the county seat. Until the construction of a county jail in 1883, the county operated in rented commercial space. The courthouse was built from 1884 through 1885 at a bid price of $11,945. It was designed by architect William Appleyard and built with John B. Sweatt as contractor. Adjacent to the building is the courthouse annex, which was built as the replacement jail in 1912. At some later point, the jail was condemned and converted to county offices. The property, including the courthouse and annex, was designated a Michigan State Historic Site on June 21, 1985. A special election was held on August 2, 2011, to decide a millage to move the courthouse to the former Baraga County Memorial Hospital or a new facility. The poor condition of the building and maintenance expenses were cited as reasons to change facilities. However, the proposal was rejected 923 to 507. On February 28, 2012, a second ballot considering the issue was rejected 1195 to 541. After purchasing the hospital was rejected, the county decided to purchase the former L'Anse Pharmacy building, located about a block from the courthouse. The building was acquired in June 2012 and the county secured financing for the purchase in August. Several offices are scheduled to be moved to the pharmacy in September. The annex will be demolished, though a time has not yet been set. Description The courthouse is a two-story red brick structure in the Late Victorian style topped by a hip-and-gable roof. The first story windows are round-head while the second story's are square- head. The adjacent two-story annex is a long and narrow hip-roofed structure. The buildings are atop a small hill.

Built as the home of one of the area's richest men, it has been designated a historic site. Born in 1832, Frederick Fabing became one of Sandusky County's leading businessmen by the late nineteenth century. At the age of thirty, he joined three other local businessmen to buy a dying gasworks, steamfitting, and plumbing company in Fremont; they succeeded in making it profitable, and it remained in business for several decades. For nearly thirty years, Fabing worked for the company, rising from a superintendent's position to the presidency.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1229. Fabing arranged for the construction of the present house in 1859, before he entered into the gasworks business. Three stories tall and built of brick,, Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2012-01-21. Fabing's house is one of the most distinctive pieces of architecture in the city. Most surviving buildings in Fremont are no older than the late nineteenth century, and various vernacular styles are prevalent; the 1850s Second Empire architecture of the Fabing House is radically different from many surrounding structures. Among its prominent features are a square tower with a mansard roof, an ornamental overdoor, a large bracketed cornice with dentils, elaborate metalwork and dormer windows, a multi-part frieze, and decorative hoodmolds. By the late twentieth century, Fabing's house was no longer exclusively a residence; it had become both home and office for a local physician. While serving as such, the house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in mid-1983; it qualified for inclusion both because of its distinctive architecture and because of its place as the home of a leading local citizen. It is one of thirteen Sandusky County sites on the Register and one of three in a two-block stretch of Park Avenue.

In a career that lasted from April 1827 to October 1829 he ran thirteen times and won seven races. Unraced as a two-year-old, he proved himself to be one of the best colts of his generation in 1827 when he won The Derby and finished second in the St Leger. Both races were surrounded by allegations of race-fixing and corruption. Mameluke raced with some success at four and five before retiring to stud. He was not a great success as a stallion. Background Mameluke was a \\"leggy and powerfully-quartered\\" bay colt with a white blaze and one white foot, bred in Northamptonshire by Mr R. C. Elwes He was bought as a yearling by Lord Jersey. Mameluke was sired by Partisan, one of the leading stallions of the time, whose other offspring included the Classic winners Patron (2000 Guineas), Cyprian (Epsom Oaks) and Zeal (1000 Guineas) as well as the successful sires Gladiator and Venison. Mameluke's dam, Miss Sophia, was a half-sister of the 1000 Guineas winner Charlotte. Racing career 1827: three-year-old season Mameluke's career began in controversy when he made his debut at Newmarket in April. He ran in the Riddlesworth Stakes, which at that time had a prestige almost equal to the Classics. Mameluke finished second to an unnamed filly by Partisan (later named Donna Maria), but the judge mistakenly awarded second place to his stable companion Glenartney, who was carrying the same colours. This error would have been unimportant if the winner had not then been disqualified for carrying the wrong weight. Glenartney, rather than Mameluke, was therefore credited as the official winner of the race. Mameluke was then able to take two valuable prizes without having to gallop for them. On 20 April he was allowed to walk over for a Sweepstakes at Newmarket when his opponents were withdrawn. He was next scheduled to take part in a match race on 30 April, but collected the ¬£200 forfeit money without running when his opponent, a filly later named as \\"Mulebird\\" failed to appear. Mameluke's next race was the Derby at Epsom, for which he started at odds of 9/1 and was ridden by James \\"Jemmy\\" Robinson. Glenartney was also in the field and started at 5/1 but Lord Jersey, who owned both colts, declined to announce a public preference for either and insisted that each horse would run on its merits. After three false starts the race got under way and Harry Edwards quickly sent Glenartney into the lead and set an extremely strong pace. With half a mile to run, most of the runners were struggling but Mameluke had moved easily into second place and the two Jersey colts raced into the straight clear of the rest of the field. After running alongside Glenartney as if taking part in an exercise gallop at home, Robinson sent Mameluke into the lead and he won comfortably, while Edwards seemed to make little effort to challenge him. It was widely believed that Glenartney had been \\"pulled\\" (deliberately restrained) by his jockey in the closing stages to allow his stable companion to win: it was known that Edwards had placed a large bet on Mameluke. Lord Jersey himself, despite his public statements, was suspected of involvement as he was also reported to have backed Mameluke heavily. The 1827 St Leger: Matilda beats Mameluke. Following the Derby, Mameluke was sold for 4,000 guineas to John Gully a former prize- fighter who had become a successful businessman and professional gambler. Gully, who moved the horse to the stable of a trainer named Sykes at Hambledon, aimed the horse for the St Leger at Doncaster and wagered heavily on his success. He reportedly stood to make more than ¬£40,000 if the colt won, and the potential losers included unscrupulous gamblers and bookmakers such as Robert Ridsdale and William Crockford. At Doncaster, the start of the St Leger was chaotic with numerous false starts: according to one source there were twenty-seven of them and the race was run in near darkness. When the starter, Mr. Lockwood finally allowed the race to begin, a filly named Matilda was well in front of the other runners, while Mameluke, who had become increasingly upset by the situation and was facing in the wrong direction, was left at least sixty yards behind. Mameluke made up the ground but had to be taken round the outside of the field by his rider Sam Chifney as rival jockeys attempted to block him. He moved up to challenge the filly in the straight, but Matilda pulled ahead again and won by a length. It was later revealed that Lockwood, who was subsequently dismissed, had been bribed to engineer the start so as to ruin Mameluke's chances. It was also reported that several of the jockeys had been bribed to delay and disrupt the proceedings as much as possible. Gully attempted to recoup some of his losses by challenging Matilda's owners to a match race two days later, but his offer was declined. A less cynical view of the 1827 St Leger was offered by Henry Hall Dixon (\\"The Druid\\") who suggested that the trouble at the start was caused by the large number of inexperienced and incompetent jockeys, and that Mameluke's defeat was primarily due to the poor conditioning he had received after his transfer to Sykes. A writer in The Sportsman on the other hand, laid the blame for Mameluke's defeat on Chifney for a lack of alertness at the start and poor judgement in making up the lost ground too quickly. Despite his defeat at Doncaster, the Farmer's Magazine called Mameluke \\"beyond all question the best horse of his year\\". 1828: four-year-old season Mameluke reappeared as a four-year-old at the Craven meeting at Newmarket in April. He won the Oatlands Handicap on 8 April and then defeated Amphion in a two-runner race for the Port Stakes. For the second successive year at Newmarket's Second Spring meeting his owner was able to claim forfeit money for a match race, when his scheduled opponent, the 1826 Epsom Oaks winner Babel (formerly known as Lilias) was withdrawn. Mameluke's return to Doncaster in September ended in disappointment as he finished unplaced behind Laurel in the Doncaster Cup. 1829: five-year-old season On his first start of 1829, Mameluke beat the four-year-old Rough Robin by two lengths in a match race at Newmarket on 8 May and then ran well in defeat in his next two races. In June he came second to the favourite Zinganee in a very strong field for the Ascot Gold Cup, finishing ahead of the Classic winners Cadland (Derby), The Colonel (St Leger) and Green Mantle (Oaks). His jockey, Will Wheatley tracked the favourite throughout but Mameluke was unable to match Zinganee's acceleration in the straight and he was beaten two lengths. According to the leading sporting correspondent Ben Marshall, Mameluke's performance established him as the second-best horse in England. He then finished second to the filly Fleur de Lis, whom he had beaten at Ascot, in the Goodwood Cup in July. In this race he was considered a very unlucky loser after Wheatley temporarily lost his way in a thick fog. In Autumn, Mameluke ran at Newmarket. At the second October meeting he was unplaced behind Lucetta in the Garden Stakes and then raced for The Whip, a four-mile challenge race for a trophy fashioned from the mane and tail of Eclipse. Mameluke captured The Whip for Gully by beating the six-year- old \\"holder\\", Lamplighter. On his final start on 26 October, Mameluke carried top weight to victory in a ¬£100 Newmarket Handicap at the Houghton meeting. Stud career At the end of his racing career, Gully sold Mameluke to William Theobald who based the stallion at his Stockwell stud in Surrey. Gully later attempted to buy the horse back, but Theobald refused. Mameluke made little impact as a stallion although some of his daughters had some influence as broodmares. At the end of 1837 it was reported that Mameluke had been sold to French breeders and was to be exported to stand as a stallion at Aurillac. He died in 1849 at age 25. Pedigree *Mameluke's pedigree contained a good deal of inbreeding.

His father was Bolo Annie of NgƒÅti HauƒÅ and his mother was Te Kahurangi. As a small child Te Waharoa lived at Maungakawa, north-east of Cambridge. A group of Te Arawa attacked Maungakawa and Te Waharoa was taken to the Rotorua district where he spent his childhood among Te Arawa. He returned to NgƒÅti HauƒÅ when he was a young man. He took part in fights during the Musket Wars, when NgƒÅti HauƒÅ supported Waikato and NgƒÅti Maniapoto tribes against Te Rauparaha and NgƒÅti Toa, until NgƒÅti Toa were driven from KƒÅwhia in 1821. Te Waharoa became the leading chief of NgƒÅti HauƒÅ. He led his tribe in preserving their territory from occupation by other tribes, including driving out NgƒÅti Maru in the 1820s, after they outstayed their welcome by weight of numbers, building 15 pa in Ngati Haua territory and the overtaxing of local food resources, when taking refuge from NgƒÅpuhi attacks on the Hauraki area. The final act that drove Te Waharoa to desperate measures was when Ngati Maru built Kaipaki pa very close to his own at Maungakawa. He spread the news that he was leaving the rohe for Tauranga so Ngati Maru would lower their guard. He then returned at night and launched a successful surprise attack on the much larger iwi. 200 people in Kaipaki pa were either eaten or enslaved.Musket Wars.p177-178 R Crosby. Reed.1999 After expelling NgƒÅti Maru from Matamata pƒÅ, near the present-day settlement of Waharoa (rather than the present-day town of Matamata), Te Waharoa made it his main pƒÅ. He also drove NgƒÅti Maru from the Horotiu district along the Waikato River and the Maungatautari district. Te Waharoa maintained military and trade links with the NgƒÅi Te Rangi and NgƒÅti Ranginui tribes who lived in the Tauranga district, across NgƒÅti HauƒÅ's eastern boundary, the Kaimai Range. When the Tauranga tribes were threatened by a NgƒÅpuhi war party led by Te Haramiti in 1831, Te Waharoa and NgƒÅti HauƒÅ went to the aid of Tupaea and the Tauranga people, and together they defeated the NgƒÅpuhi party. Also in December 1831 Te Wahoroa joined with a huge Waikato force estimated at 2,500 to 4,000 warriors under Te Whero whero who launched an assault on North Taranaki tribes Ngati Tama and Ngati Mutanga. In January 1832 the Waikato taua with Te Wahaoroa launched further assaults against Pukerangiora Pa which held 4,000 people. The besieged ran out of food and a large group of Taranaki children, women and older people fled at night. Most were caught by Waikato and killed,with only a few escaping. Two weeks later the men ran out of food and tried to escape at night in a sudden rush. In their weakened state they were easily overcome and many jumped over cliffs to avoid the Waikato slaughter. In all between 1,000 and 1500 people were killed. As was usual prisoner were killed and eaten with prisoners \\" being decapitated, disembowelled ,cooked and eaten\\". The battle was noted for its savagery with Waikato going down to the bottom of the cliffs and killing those who had survived the leap.The Musket Wars . p242-245. When Anglican missionaries came to his region, Te Waharoa wished to have a missionary resident there and a mission station was established near Matamata pƒÅ in 1835. One of the first students at the mission school was Te Waharoa's son Tarapipipi, later known as Wiremu Tamihana. After a relative of Te Waharoa was murdered by a Te Arawa man, there were a number of skirmishes with Te Arawa in 1836. NgƒÅti HauƒÅ, with support from other tribes, attacked and destroyed a Te Arawa pƒÅ and Phillip Tapsell's trading station at Maketu in March. Then in August NgƒÅti HauƒÅ attacked NgƒÅti Whakaue at Ohinemutu in Rotorua. Helead his warriors against neighbouring tribes with the fighting, which continued into 1836, extended from Rotorua, Matamata to Tauranga. Te Waharoa fell ill in 1838. He probably had erysipelas, which his principal wife Rangi Te Wiwini died of at the time. Te Waharoa died at Matamata in early September 1838. Te Arahi, the eldest son of Te Waharoa and Rangi Te Wiwini, became the leader of NgƒÅti HauƒÅ, before his younger brother Wiremu Tamihana Tarapipipi rose to prominence.

Kong is a prominent Chinese media figure, known for his vulgar and often brusque critiques on political issues and various individuals and groups. Kong has often been portrayed in the media as a figure of the Chinese New Left, calling for a reversal of Chinese economic reforms and a return to Mao-style policies. Biography Kong was born to a worker's family during the Cultural Revolution era,and was devoted to studying Lu Xun early in his academic career. Kong first achieved fame as the author of various books describing his graduate student life in Peking University, in which the self-described \\"Drunkard of Peking University\\" commentated on many Chinese social issues. An avid reader and researcher of Chinese wuxia fiction, Kong briefly lectured on wuxia author Jin Yong on CCTV's Lecture Room series, as well as giving a talk on the Chinese essayist and language reformer Lu Xun on the same series. Kong Qingdong was a participant in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, and after he was named a professor of Chinese studies by Peking University, Kong began publishing essays in which he espoused Chinese patriotism and communist orthodoxy. Kong has praised the North Korean government on various occasions, claiming that the Koreans \\"will surely die off\\", if not for \\"the great leader (Kim Jong-il) and his Workers' Party\\". Additionally, Kong has organized study groups on juche, the official ideology in North Korea, at Peking University; some sources, such as Southern Metropolis Daily, accuse the group of providing intelligence to North Korea. In the 2000s, Kong spent 2 years in South Korea, teaching at the Ewha Womans University. Kong hosts a talk show program and his microblog has a large following. Involvement with the Confucius Peace Prize Kong Qingdong has been involved in the Confucius Peace Prize, a Chinese prize set up in response to Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded to the Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo amid China's protest. Kong claims that the prize, which was awarded to Lien Chan and Vladimir Putin in its first two years (none of whom accepted it), accurately reflects Confucius's vision of peace. Political views Kong, in addition to being described as a nationalist, has also been described as a figure of the Chinese New Left, a political faction that believes China's economic reforms have gone too far and the country needs to revert to a more socialist and egalitarian society with heavy state control. He was a supporter of quasi-Maoist political figure Bo Xilai prior to and after the politician's disgrace. He has criticized the Chinese government, calling it \\"shameless\\", ostensibly for its pursuit of capitalist-style policies. Controversies Kong is notorious for numerous forthright and expletive-ridden rants against a number of groups and individuals, and his polarizing views have frequently generated controversy, but have also rallied supporters. Personal Attacks Kong once called former United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton a \\"bitch\\", and performing artist Jiang Kun a xiasanlan (), a derogatory term for \\"three dirty professions\\" of prostitution, beggars, and street artists). Attacks on Media Kong has repeatedly criticized China's liberal media, particularly Southern Chinese journals and newspapers, as \\"hanjian media\\". Kong has also called CCTV \\"inhuman\\". In November 2011, Southern Weekly, described as a 'beachhead' for China's liberal media, reached out to Kong for an interview. Rejecting the request, Kong published on his microblog that \\"the treasonous newspaper has harassed me once again by asking to interview me\\"; Kong answered the request with a Chinese expression of profanity using the word 'mom' three times (). The use of profanity drew Kong considerable criticism online, to the point of calling for his resignation, although he also received widespread support, with some online straw polls turning out in favor of Kong. Commentators pointed out that Kong's popularity is a symptom of the widespread resentment of the elite liberal media, which often run editorials critical of poor people and make economic arguments to justify the increasing wealth gap. Kong himself asserted he used the expletives deliberately to 'lure out' his enemies in the liberal Chinese media, having predicted that they would respond to him vehemently with what he called \\"counterrevolutionary encirclement.\\" Some eighty media outlets reportedly criticized Kong for his remarks. Following the barrage of negative media attention, Kong then directly criticized the state-run Xinhua News Agency, saying that it was no longer under the control of the Party's Central Committee but taking orders from Guangdong party chief Wang Yang, seen as the representative of China's political 'right.' The journalist in question later defended Kong, claiming that the profanity is \\"a later embellishment when Kong published his microblog post\\". Overseas media speculated that Kong's remarks was merely part of a much larger battle between the political left and right in China. His singling out of Wang Yang by name was cited as evidence of the intensifying struggle for China's future political direction. Attack on Journalist In November 2008, Qian Liexian (pen name of Xu Lai), a journalist at New Beijing, a newspaper affiliated with Southern Daily at the time, alleged in his blog that Kong Qingdong has been interrogated by the Beijing police for spying for North Korea. A few months later, in February 2009, Qian was assaulted and stabbed by Yang Chun, a personal assistant of Kong Qingdong, who accused Qian of offending \\"a friend\\". Southern Metropolis Daily, another newspaper affiliated with Southern Daily, criticized Kong Qingdong's involvement in the affairs. Attacks on Government Kong has criticized the Shenzhen municipal government as \\"reactionary\\", and the Chinese government \\"shameless.\\" Support for Bo Xilai In March 2012, upon the dismissal of Bo Xilai, a renowned leftist figure in China, Kong showered Bo with praise on his talk show, calling Bo a \\"mob-fighting hero.\\" Kong called Bo's dismissal by the Chinese authorities \\"a counterrevolutionary coup.\\" Kong also took a moment to \\"criticize the people, the masses... what have you done to construct socialism? What have you done for Chongqing, for China? If you are a supporter of Bo Xilai, then what have you done to support Bo Xilai? What have you done to save the country from sinking into the abyss of capitalism? Don't just sit there waiting for a lecture from professor Kong and lament the state of affairs, this world isn't just for heroes to save!\\" North Korea Kong has expressed admiration for the North Korean Juche ideology, in addition to its late leader Kim Jong-il. Western Culture Kong is critical of Western culture. He has supported a boycott of the film Kung Fu Panda 2, calling it an instrument of cultural invasion by the West. After the Apple Inc. co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs died in 2011, Kong remarked that \\"the more people like Steve Jobs die, the better\\". Anti-Rightist Movement In 2007, the liberal writer Zhang Yihe (, daughter of Zhang Bojun, a notable Chinese intellectual and victim of Mao Zedong's Anti-Rightist Movement) published the now banned Past Histories of Peking Opera Stars, in which she criticized the Anti- Rightist Movement and affirmed that she \\"will not give up the defense of my basic civil rights, because it affects the dignity and conscience of a person\\". Kong fiercely attacked Zhang in a lecture, referring to Zhang's social class as \\"the enemy of our government.\\" Kong further defended the Anti- Rightist Movement and addressed to the \\"Old rightists\\" that \\"you (the rightists) think that you are proper heroes, so why are you asking the Communist Party for vindication? ‚Ä¶ our cases have been overturned after the reforms began, but why do the big rightists want to demand hundreds more times in compensation from the people?\\" Hong Kong In January 2012, Kong commented on a viral video on his talk show. In the video, a Mainland Chinese mother on a Hong Kong MTR train engaged in an argument with a fellow passenger, a native Hong Konger who tried to stop her young child from eating on the train. Kong lashed out on the Hong Kong passenger, criticizing the man's use of Cantonese (as opposed to the Mandarin used in Mainland China) and calling him a \\"colonial elitist\\" and a \\"bastard.\\" He went on to make sweeping remarks about Hong Kong people in general, saying multiple times that \\"many Hong Kongers\\" are \\"bastards,\\" and \\"dogs.\\" Kong further claimed that the Hong Kong people are \\"willing dogs of the British ‚Ä¶ To this day they think that they are dogs, not people\\". Kong stated that in their purported 'colonial mentality,' Hong Kong people are \\"dogs in front of the British, but wolves in front of the Chinese,\\" comparing them to Korean and Taiwanese supporters of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. Kong pointed out that the reaction on the MTR would not have been the same had a white person, i.e., a Briton or an American, been in the same situation, rather than a person from Mainland Chinese. Kong asserted that Hong Kong had some \\"positive traits,\\" one of which is rule of law, which was enforced only because \\"the British spanked them [Hong Kongers]\\" if they broke the law; and, in response to Hong Kong's society, Kong said of Hong Kong people: \\"your society's order is maintained by law, which means that you have no self-restraint, which means that you are a vile ([] ji√†n) people\\". The remarks circulated widely on social media sites in Hong Kong and became the focus of controversy and protests in the territory in early 2012, causing further tensions in what were already strained Mainland Chinese-Hong Kong relations. Two candidates of the 2012 Hong Kong Chief Executive election, Leung Chun-Ying and Henry Tang, criticized Kong. Reactions were mixed in Mainland China to Kong's remarks. Some prominent Chinese academics came out to criticize Kong, but he also received support on the internet. Several days later, Kong fired back at the criticism leveled at him, saying that the media and internet users were on a witch hunt to 'cherry pick' his words in order to attack him, asserting that he did not mean to say that Hong Kong people are dogs, or that non-Mandarin Chinese-speakers are dogs. He also said that he was confident the \\"majority of Hong Kongers\\" were not critical of him and that the internet backlash to be part of a well-executed conspiracy by fringe activists to silence him. In his defence, he stated that \\"there are good people and bad people everywhere; there are dogs everywhere. Some Beijing people are dogs.\\" Singapore Kong has called a female Singaporean journalist \\"a whore\\", in addition to criticizing Singaporeans as \\"completely ignorant\\". Kong was quoted as saying \\"I've been to Singapore. Those people from Singapore... they basically don't know anything.\\" Taiwanese election On 28 January 2012, Kong asserted on a Chinese television program that the 2012 presidential election in Taiwan is \\"fake democracy\\" and is \\"comparable to a soap opera.\\" He remarked that he did not see \\"much progress\\" in Taiwan during the four years of Ma Ying-jeou's term in Taiwan, and that Ma's winning of six million votes was not impressive, \\"not even half the population of Beijing.\\" Kong said that Ma's razor-thin margin of victory over his rival Tsai Ing-wen was comparable to the population of Zhongguancun, a neighbourhood of Beijing, and that it still reflected a deeply divided Taiwanese society. Both the incumbent Kuomintang and the Democratic Progressive Party have rebuked Kong's remarks. Michelle Obama In early 2014, during the U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama's state visit to China, Kong alleged on his Sina Weibo account that Michelle Obama was successfully confronted and rebuked by a Peking University student while giving a speech supporting free speech. The student supposedly asked Michelle Obama, \\"is America‚Äôs strength a result of the U.S. secret services listening to the voices of its citizens? Could you tell me in America what the difference is between ‚Äòlistening to‚Äô and ‚Äòlistening in‚Äô?‚Äù in a reference to the NSA spying scandal. Kong further described Michelle Obama's response as ‚Äúdumbfounded by the question, Michelle Obama eventually replied that she was not there to talk about politics.\\" After Kong had made his allegations, reporters and students present at Michelle Obama's speech denied that the confrontation took place. Kong was subsequently widely panned for having fabricated the entire story, which critics have noted can subject him to arrest under the same criteria with which the police had arrested hundreds of people accused of spreading rumors online in mid-2013. In response, Kong simply called the critics \\"dogs of America\\" and \\"traitors to China.\\" \\"Is Kong Qingdong a savage\\" incident Wu Xiaoping (Âê¥ÊôìÂπ≥), host with Nanjing Television, analyzed a case surrounding Kong Qingdong on the former's show Tingwo Shaoshao (Âê¨ÊàëÈü∂Èü∂), with the provocative title \\"Kong Qingdong: Is he a Jiaoshou (ÊïôÊéà, \\"professor\\") or Yeshou (ÈáéÂÖΩ \\"savage\\").\\" Kong, insulted that he was called a \\"savage\\", responded by attempting to sue Wu for libel in a Beijing court, seeking damages of 200,000 yuan, accusing Wu of tarnishing his reputation. However, the Beijing court ruled against Kong upon first review, stating that the news media has an interest in the \\"public good\\" since restricting news commentary to use only 'civilized' language would unduly restrict for what is permissible on air and limit \\"sharp commentary\\" used to make valid points.

It is patterned after the SIG 55x series rifles that fire 5.56x45mm centerfire cartridges. The 522 fires .22 LR ammunition and serves as a training rifle for its larger counterparts due to mostly identical controls and features. It differs from its centerfire counterpart in a number of ways. The 522 series has no adjustable gas block as the 55x series does. Instead, a mock gas block is installed. SIG refers to this as a storage container. Instead of 30-round magazines, the 522 series accepts 10-round or 25-round magazines that are manufactured by Black Dog Machine and re-branded for distribution with the SIG 522. Black Dog also produces a 50 round drum magazine for the 522. Variants 522 Classic The SIG 522 Classic has a standard polymer handguard, M1913 Picatinny rail on top of the receiver, and folding and telescoping stock. A flash hider modeled after the M16-A2 style \\"Bird Cage\\" flash suppressor is installed. Options include SIG Sauer iron sights and a SIG-branded mini red dot sight that mounts on top of the Picatinny rail.

Weight is 6 lb, 6oz, and the SWAT has the same flash hider as the Classic. 522 Commando The 522 Commando features a folding stock and mock suppressor mounted to 1/2 √ó 28 TPI threads. It has the standard non-railed polymer handguards. It weighs 6 lbs, 2oz. 522 SWAT Commando The 522 SWAT Commando features the same mock suppressor mounted to the 522 Commando, but adds a shorter version of the SWAT's aluminum railed front end. It weighs the same as the 522 Commando at 6 lb, 2oz. 522 Target The newest in the 522 lineup, the SIG Sauer 522 Target has an aluminum tube front end that is free floated from the barrel to increase accuracy.

The Royal Navy took her into service as HMS Surinam, as there was already an . The Dutch captured her in 1803, naming her Suriname, but the British recaptured her in 1807 and sent her to Britain. Thereafter she never again served on active duty. She disappeared from the Navy lists in 1809, but her fate is unknown. Capture On 20 August 1799, a British force under the command of Lieutenant-General Thomas Trigge and Vice Admiral the Right Honourable Lord Hugh Seymour captured the Dutch colony of Suriname. Among the various items of booty was the French corvette Hussar. The American ships (24) and (12), searching for French vessels that had been preying on American merchantmen, had blockaded Hussar for two months in the Suriname River.DANFS: Scammel. Eventually, Hussar surrendered to the Americans, who removed her crew. Shortly thereafter the British arrived and captured Suriname. The Americans agreed that the British had rights to Hussar herself as she had been in inland waters upon the surrender of Suriname. (The British also captured the Dutch brig- sloop Kemphaan, which they took into service under the name Camphaan.) The letter reporting the corvette's capture describes her as \\"The French Corvette L'Hussar, a very fine Vessel, only Seven Months old; mounts Twenty Nine- Pounders\\". The British renamed her Surinam and Lieutenant Christopher Cole, of was appointed to command her. British service Surinam then served on the Leeward Islands station. Over the period from late March to early April 1800 Cole captured two French privateers and recaptured a merchant schooner. First, on 24 March, he captured the sloop Consolateur, of one gun and 35 men. She too left Point-√†-Pitre, Guadeloupe on a cruise. Second, two days later he captured the sloop Renard, of three guns and 15 men. She two had left Point-√†-Pitre. Lastly, on 3 April re recaptured the schooner Lack. Cole also introduced new regulations aboard his ship that kept his men in good health in the Caribbean Sea. In 1801, Seymour died from a fever, but Cole's activities had already been noticed by Sir John Thomas Duckworth who replaced Seymour and Cole was made a post captain on 30 June 1801 in Duckworth's flagship . Cole's replacement was Lieutenant Randall MacDonnell. His replacement, in 1803, was Commander Robert Tucker (acting). Commodore Sir Samuel Hood sent Tucker and Surinam on a mission to Saint-Domingue to try to secure the release of two British officers reportedly in the hands of the rebels at Gona√Øves. On discovering that one of the officers had already been executed and that the other had escaped, Tucker then sailed to Jacmel, where he assisted the besieged French garrison. Two days after leaving Jacmel, Surinam sustained damage and Tucker then put in at Cura√ßao for repairs.Marshall (1832), Vol. 3, Part 2, pp.385-91. Capture by the Dutch While Tucker was at St Anna Bay, Cura√ßao, the Dutch found out, from a prize that Tucker had sent to Jamaica for news and that had returned, that war had been declared between Britain and Holland. The Dutch then seized Tucker and Surinam on 23 June, despite Tucker's best efforts to escape. The Dutch first released Surinams crew, and then Tucker and his officers, in hopes of an exchange of prisoners. Tucker himself spent some four months in close confinement in a dungeon. At his subsequent court-martial, Tucker was acquitted of all blame for the loss. However, the court-martial did reprimand Tucker for unofficerlike conduct in his dealings with the Dutch authorities. It ordered him to be put at the bottom of the list of Commanders; thereafter he never again was employed in the Royal Navy. The Dutch took Surinam into service as Suriname. Recapture and fate The capture of Cura√ßao, depicted by Thomas Whitcombe On 1 January 1807 , , , , and captured Cura√ßao, and with it Suriname. The Dutch resisted, and Suriname suffered five men wounded, including her captain, Jan Van Ness; one of the wounded died later. The British described her as having 22 guns. The British also captured the Dutch frigate \\"Kenau Hasselaar\\", which they took into service as (or Halstaar). Her captain, Cornelius J. Evertz, had also commanded the Dutch naval force in Cura√ßao. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issue of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Curacoa 1 Jany. 1807\\" to the 65 surviving claimants from the action. Captain Charles Brisbane, captain of Arethusa and commander of the squadron, also received a gold medal. In February 1807 Commander Henry Higman was appointed to command Surinam on the Jamaica station. Towards the end of the year he sailed her back to Britain. In 1806, Higman had briefly been captain of another . Some records suggest that Suriname was later renamed Sasnarang, the Navy having already commissioned another Surinam. A more likely name is Samarang, Sir Edward Pellew in Psyche having captured several Dutch vessels at Samarang in August. Surinam (or Samarang or Sasnarang) saw no further active service. She remained on the Navy lists until 1809, but her eventual disposition is unknown.

Description The size of the shell varies between 27 mm and 44 mm. (Original description by H.Pilsbry) The shell is slender and lengthened, the diameter somewhat exceeding one-third of the length. The high straight-sided spire occupies two- fifths the length of the shell. The apex is broken. The 12 whorls remaining are flat, with the smooth peripheral angle immediately above the suture, but scarcely projecting, a little more prominent on the upper than on the lower whorls. The surface of each whorl is a trifle concave, and sculptured with about 6 low, unequal spiral cords. Below the peripheral angle the body whorl is sculptured with about 25 spiral grooves, weaker above, stronger and closer below; and the growth-striae curve strongly backward near the angle. The aperture is very narrow, and of equal width throughout, and two-thirds as long as the shell.Pilsbry, Henry A., Sc.D.

(16 December 2008) Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of \\"stinging\\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.  Taxonomic relation  Conus vautieri was originally named as a subspecies of Conus pulicarius Hwass in Brugui√®re, 1792, but has been recognized as a valid species, alternative representation in the genus Puncticulis. Description The size of the shell varies between 27 mm and 75 mm. The spire is tuberculate. The sides of the body whorl are nearly direct. The color of the shell is white, with chestnut spots, overlaid here and there by lighter chestnut clouds.G.W.

Considered the standard-bearer for modern Malagasy poetry,Auzias & Labourdette (2008), p. 142 Rajaonarison's published poetry anthologies earned him international recognition and have been translated into French and English. Biography Elie Rajaonarison was born on November 15, 1951 in Ambatondrazaka, a town in the central highlands of Madagascar. His marriage to Mamisoa Ramananarivo as a young man produced three daughters. A prolific poet and advocate for Malagasy traditional culture and the arts, Rajaonarison founded the Malagasy poetry association Faribolana Sandratra to advance the development of poetry among Madagascar's youth. He was credited with inspiring a new generation of Malagasy poets and artists through his advocacy and highly attended public performances of his works, which were regularly held at the Centre Germano-Malgache (CGM) in Antananarivo. Provocative folk-fusion singer Samo√´la referenced Elie Rajaonarison in a song entitled \\"Soly\\" on his first album, Mampirevy (1997), advising those with troubled hearts to find solace in his poetry (\\"Omeko anao ny tononkalon'i Elie Rajaonarison...\\"). Rajaonarison has also translated several poems by Jacques Prevert from French into Malagasy. Rajaonarison was an active advocate for preserving and advancing Madagascar's wide range of performing arts. He developed a theatrical piece in partnership with the Centre Culturel Francais called Tana-Cergy, which was performed by a troupe of Malagasy and French actors and toured widely in France to positive reviews. In the interest of exposing Malagasy people to the wider world of theater, Rajaonarison successfully undertook the translation of Bernard-Marie Kolt√®s' works from French into Malagasy. His photography, a second passion, earned him accolades in artistic circles. He wrote and directed several films, and worked with other concerned artists to found the Malagasy National Committee of ICOMOS (International Council on Monuments and Sites) to advocate for the protection of Madagascar's tangible cultural and historic heritage. Rajaonarison served as Secretary General to the Minister of Culture in the 1990s under President Albert Zafy, and was formerly a member of the AVI political party of Norbert Ratsirahonana. A faculty member of the University of Madagascar at Ankatso, Antananarivo, for over 25 years, Rajaonarison was promoted mid-career to head the Department of Sociology. His classes and research explored Malagasy culture, history, arts and world view. He was noted for his strong convictions, love of Madagascar and warm personality. On November 27, 2010, Rajaonarison died of food poisoning at the age of 57. He received state honors and his death was widely mourned in Madagascar.

It was composed by A.B. Quintanilla‚Äîher brother and principal record producer, whose intention was to showcase Selena's diverse musical abilities. Selena included it on the album to help her cross over into the English-speaking market. Critics praised her emotive enunciation in the song. After Selena was murdered in 1995, a posthumous music video made for VH1 was released to promote the triple box-set Anthology (1998). \\"Missing My Baby\\" is a mid-tempo R&B; ballad influenced by urban and soul music. The lyrics describe the love felt by the narrator, who reminisces of rhapsodic events she has shared with her lover. In some parts of the song, the narrator experiences loneliness and anguish because of the absence of her boyfriend. Although never intended to be released as a single, the track peaked at number 22 on the US Rhythmic Top 40 chart in 1995 after Selena's death.  Background and development  \\"Missing My Baby\\" was written by Selena's brother and the song's principal record producer A.B. Quintanilla. It was created for Selena's 1992 album Entre a Mi Mundo, to showcase her diverse musical abilities and to add to the album's variety of musical styles, which include Mexican pop and traditional Mexican songs, whereas \\"Missing My Baby\\" is in the style of contemporary R&B.; After the release of Selena's full- length Spanish albums Selena (1989) and Ven Conmigo (1990), which included Tejano and other Mexican pop styles, she decided that her next recording would feature an English-language song. She believed that such a song would convince EMI Records' chairman Charles Koppelman that she was ready to release a crossover album. EMI had wanted her to acquire a larger fan base before launching her crossover career. In spite of this, Selena included the song on Entre a Mi Mundo. Quintanilla III wrote \\"Missing My Baby\\" in a week, and three weeks later, in late 1991, it was recorded at Sun Valley, Los Angeles. EMI Latin wanted R&B; duo Full Force to perform a remixed version of the recording. Quintanilla III and Selena met with the group at their Brooklyn recording studio, and Full Force agreed to add backing vocals, which they recorded in two days. EMI Latin, the record label Selena belongs to, chose Full Force's version of \\"Missing My Baby\\" instead of Selena's solo version of the song.  Composition  \\"Missing My Baby\\" is a mid-tempo R&B; ballad with influences of urban and soul music. It is in the key of D major, at 144 beats per minute in common time. The recording incorporates melisma, with sung poetry during the downtempo part of the song. The melody is accompanied by backing vocals, and instrumentation is provided by an electric piano, drums, a keyboard, a synthesizer and strings. Contemporary music critics praised Selena's emotive enunciation, which emphasized the song's title and central theme. R&B; duo Full Force were the backing vocalists for the original and remix versions of \\"Missing My Baby\\". J.R. Reynolds, formerly of Billboard, called \\"Missing My Baby\\" a \\"dreamy ballad\\" with an \\"R&B-styled; melody under Selena's pop vocals\\". Ramiro Burr of the Austin American-Statesman described it as a soul ballad. Jerry Johnston of the Deseret News thought that Selena displayed a \\" baby-voice\\" in \\"Missing My Baby\\" and that she \\"displays a wonderful suppleness in her voice\\". The Virginian-Pilot said that the song was built on hooks that recall Diana Ross's \\"Missing You\\", which is a tribute to Marvin Gaye, and the Beach Boys' \\"Good to My Baby\\". The song begins with a drum solo before the other instruments enter to form the musical foundation. Selena sings to her absent lover about how much she misses him, saying that he is \\"always on [her] mind\\" and that she feels lonely when he is not with her. Three times she sings, \\"I often think of the happy times we spent together / And I just can't wait to tell you that I love you\\". In the chorus, she sings of wanting to hold him tight and feel his heartbeat.  Critical reception and legacy  \\"Missing My Baby\\" received positive reviews from critics. Vibe magazine reported that Full Force was awarded gold and platinum discs for \\"Missing My Baby\\" and \\"Techno Cumbia\\", and described \\"Missing My Baby\\" as giving a \\"hint of her aspirations\\". After it was remixed by Quintanilla III and later produced for the 1995 album Dreaming of You, the Hi XD said that it was the best English-language song on the album. Chris Riemenschneider and John T. Davis of the Austin American-Statesman wrote that \\"Missing My Baby can sound as fluffy as the Big M's \\"Crazy for You\\". Cary Clack of the San Antonio Express-News wrote that \\"Missing My Baby\\" was played on non-Tejano radio stations and that he thought it might become a posthumous hit, while commenting that the recording \\"displays [Selena's] wonderful vocal and emotional range\\". However, Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News believed that \\"Missing My Baby\\" and other tracks were added to Entre a Mi Mundo \\"for good measure\\". \\"Missing My Baby\\" was one of the first Selena songs to be played on radio stations after she was murdered by Yolanda Sald√≠var, her friend and former manager of her Selena Etc. boutiques. A music video of the song, incorporating footage from Selena's personal home videos, was released for VH1 in 1998 to promote the triple box-set Anthology. Billboard reported that the video was the 47th most played music video for that channel in the week ending 5 April 1998.

Route The main railway would run 146 km from Lothair in Mpumalanga in South Africa to Sidvokodvo Junction in Eswatini. This would reduce the pressure on the Richards Bay line, removing general freight traffic, hence allowing more coal export trains and reducing the volume of coal transported by road. There are also plans for 600 km of connecting railways, and this route fits with several other Transnet infrastructure projects which concentrate on coal transport. This would also allow further development of the railway which takes coal from the Waterberg Coalfield via Ermelo to Richards Bay; the Waterberg coalfields have South Africa's biggest undeveloped coal reserves. Project The project officially began in January 2012 and was initially expected to cost between R15bn and R17bn, with the South African government paying up to R12bn. The Swazi government suggested that PPP would be used, or another source of external funding. The Lothair - Sidvokodvo line itself was forecast to cost R7.3 billion, and another R8.6 billion would be spent on connecting railways. The first trains were expected to start running in 2015 or 2016. In July 2014, Swazi Railways estimated that the link would cost R17 billion and could enter service in 2017.

It aired on February 13, 2012. Plot Because Ted asked him to be his wingman, Barney meets a woman named Quinn who sees through all of his plays. To compensate for the poor night out, Barney insists that he and Ted try their luck on the late-night \\"Drunk Train\\", the last train out of the city, which is filled with the drunkest, most desperate bridge and tunnel people. The duo runs into difficulty scoring on the train, but they succeed on their third attempt when they find a solution: getting drunk themselves, until Barney reveals that he and Quinn had hooked up that first night. Ted realizes that Barney keeps thinking about Quinn, and tells him that if he feels something for her he should go after her, as it is Valentine's Day and such opportunities are rare. Ted admits that he is disappointed that he still has no-one he cannot stop thinking about. At the end of the night, Barney takes a cab ride with a woman but stops himself short of having sex with her. When she asks if he has a girlfriend, he replies that maybe someday he will. On a couples retreat for Valentine's Day, Marshall and Lily try to show Robin and Kevin that the success to a long-term relationship is not to \\"keep score\\". Lily and Marshall eventually end up bickering over the issue, but when they return home they decide, as impending parents, that they should work together as a team and no longer keep score. On the weekend trip Kevin proposes to Robin, who wants to accept but must decide how to tell him that she cannot have children and does not ever want them. After consulting Marshall and Lily, she tells Kevin, who still wants to marry her. However, because Robin does not want Kevin to regret marrying her, she firmly tells him that she does not want to have children ever, not even by adoption, forcing Kevin to truly reflect on the issue. He then takes back the proposal and they break up. When Ted and Robin meet on the roof, Robin explains everything to him and confesses that she finally feels ready to have a serious relationship but believes she will not be able to find someone who can accept her now. In response, Ted says that he could and tells her he loves her. Meanwhile, unknown to Barney, Quinn is revealed to be a dancer at the Lusty Leopard strip club and comments that he should have recognized her earlier due to his frequent visits. Quinn is actually the stripper 'Karma' whom Barney knew. Critical response Donna Bowman of the A.V. Club gave the episode a B, stating that Marshall and Lily's story inter- cutting with Kevin and Robin's made it a \\"return to form\\" after the disappointment of the previous episode. Alan Sepinwall of Hitfix.com said Robin's breakup with Kevin and Ted's admission of feelings for her is part of Victoria's warning at the end of \\"Ducky Tie\\" coming true. Ethan Alter of Television Without Pity gave the episode a C‚àí, stating that he dreaded the consequences of Ted's confession to Robin for the rest of the season. Audience reviews were reported to be similarly negative, with criticism levelled at the way Ted still had feelings for Robin after 152 episodes despite the pilot explicitly stating that there was no future for them.

In 1966 he was killed in the Yarmouk Camp in Damascus during an attempt to ease tensions between Palestinian leaders Yasser Arafat and Ahmed Jibril. Military career Urabi served as a major for one of the regular Palestinian Liberation Army (PLA) units within the Syrian Army. He sympathized with Ba'athism, an ideology promoting pan-Arabism and socialism and was a close military adviser and friend of Hafez al-Assad.Rapoport, p.467.Rubin, p.34. Urabi enlisted with al-Assifa, the armed wing of Fatah, in the late 1950s.Joint Publications Research Service, 1993, p.12. Al-Assad, who was Defense Minister at the time, selected Urabi in 1966 to head the operations of Fatah‚Äîwhich was based in Syria‚Äîand instructed Yasser Arafat and other Fatah leaders to recognize Urabi's authority.Kiernan, p.211. Death On 5 May 1966, during a meeting chaired by Urabi to alleviate tensions between Arafat and Ahmed Jibril in the Yarmouk Refugee Camp, Urabi was assassinated. Consequently, Arafat along with his aide Khalil al-Wazir and several other Fatah officials were arrested and imprisoned on al-Assad's orders. Al-Assad personally interrogated al-Wazir and the officials who denied being present at the scene. The circumstances of Urabi's killing at Yarmouk are disputed. Al- Wazir claimed that al-Assad, Jibril and the Military Intelligence Directorate had planned to assassinate Arafat using Urabi to lure the latter into a trap. Jibril aborted the meeting at the last minute and Arafat also did not attend without notifying Jibril. Instead, the former sent a Palestinian Syrian Army officer named Adnan and the latter sent a colleague, Mohammed Hishme with bodyguard Abdul Majib Zahmud who was to remain outside of the meeting. According to Zahmud, a loud argument took place with Adnan yelling at Urabi. Then, Adnan allegedly shot and killed both Urabi and Hishme before fleeing the scene. Arafat and al-Wazir were arrested, but both claimed they were not present at the scene because of an emergency meeting with another intelligence officer, Ahmed Sweidani. They were later pardoned by President Salah Jadid after Sweidany confirmed their statement.Hart, pp.204-205 In contrast, according to Palestinian writer Said Aburish, Urabi was defenestrated from a third-floor window and died immediately. While Arafat was not present when Syrian police arrived to the crime scene, he had sought refuge in a Syrian police coronel house. He then pleaded President Jedid for protection, but was subsequently detained by police on al-Assad orders. Arafat and al-Wazir were moved to the Mezzah prison and kept in solitary confinement. Assad appointed a three-man jury to investigate the case, which found Arafat guilty, sentencing him to death. But finally Jedid released Arafat and closed the file.Aburish, pp.63 References Bibliography    * Category:1966 deaths Category:Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party ‚Äì Syria Region politicians Category:Fatah military commanders Category:Syrian military personnel Category:Suicides by defenestration Category:Year of birth missing Category:Palestinian Arab nationalists ","title":"Yusef Urabi"},{"id":"34453536","title":"List of number-one hits of 2011 (Denmark)"},{"id":"34453554","text":"The Illinois State Senate Election of 2012 was held on November 6th, 2012.

He was selected for the 1985 Ashes squad but did not appear in any of the Test matches on the tour. Career Phillips made his club debut in 1971 aged 15. He toured Sri Lanka in 1971 with the Australian Schoolboys and played for NSW Colts for three years. His first job after school was working for Bert Oldfield. First Class Cricketer Phillips played three games for NSW but Steve Rixon was blocking his path so he moved to Queensland in 1979. Phillips scored his debut first class century in 1981‚Äì82. After Marsh retired in 1984, Phillips was considered a candidate for the keeping position for the tour of the West Indies. However the selectors preferred Roger Woolley, who had a better batting record, with Wayne Phillips as a backup. When Woolley was injured the selectors went for Wayne Phillips. Wayne Phillips impressed enough on the tour to be kept as Australian keeper for the 1984‚Äì85 summer. When he was injured, selectors relied on Steve Rixon. Rixon and Wayne Phillips were selected as the keepers on the 1985 Ashes tour. Rixon had to drop out when it was revealed he had signed to tour South Africa and Ray Phillips was selected in his place. In the 1984‚Äì85 Sheffield Shield final, Phillips scored 53 and 47 in Queensland's one wicket loss.https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/45/45733.html Ashes Tourist Ray Phillips was the reserve keeper on the tour and did not play in any test matches. He played 7 first class games taking 13 catches with a top score of 39, against Worcestershire, where he took part in a 96 run stand with Alan Border.https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/45/45828.html Later career Wayne Phillips' keeping declined over the 1985‚Äì86 summer and there were some calls to replace him with Ray Phillips. However, when Wayne was dropped as keeper in 1986, the selectors went for Tim Zoehrer. Phillips' last first glass game was the 1985‚Äì86 Sheffield Shield final, which Queensland lost. Ray Phillips retired from all forms of cricket in August 1986. He was replaced as Queensland's wicketkeeper by Peter Anderson. Post cricket career Phillips commentated cricket matches for ABC radio. He was also a selector for the Queensland cricket team. Phillips gained notoriety on social media site Reddit after commentating on a Cricket Australia live stream where he proceeded to complain about aspects of cricket and life in general including players performing hand shakes and high fives, players taking unscheduled drinks breaks, toasters, and his views that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation had become too one-sided.

Both sites are referred to as nature reserves by the owner, the Scottish Wildlife Trust. They are also both contributing reserves to the Clyde Valley Woodlands National Nature Reserve. Lower Nethan Gorge The Lower Nethan Gorge reserve, located near Lanark, is one of the best examples of semi-natural woodland still surviving in the Clyde Valley. Ash and elm woodlands grow on its steep slopes. The gorge is home to many species of flora and fauna, including green woodpeckers, otters, and badgers. Lower Nethan Gorge was declared a part of the Clyde Valley Woodlands National Nature Reserve in 2007. Upper Nethan Gorge The Upper Nethan Gorge reserve, located near Blackwood and Lesmahagow, is part of the Clyde and Avon Valley Landscape Partnership and the Clyde Valley Woodlands National Nature Reserve. The reserve's woodlands support a large range of species, including locally uncommon plants such as broad-leaved helleborine (Epipactis helleborine), wood melick (Melica uniflora), and meadow saxifrage (Saxifraga granulata).

Formed in 2006, the lineup consisted of Chris Keene (lead vocals, guitar), Aurore Ounjian (lead guitar, backing vocals), Mikey Holland (drums), and Kevin Macdonald (bass). The band released four albums over the course of their career. History Formation and name (2006) Vocalists Chris Keene and Aurore Ounjian had previously toured together as a folk duo, before working together on what would later become Mean Creek. After adding drummer Mikey Holland and bassist Erik Wormwood in 2006, the lineup was complete. \\"This is the final incarnation of the band,\\" says Holland. \\"We're going to release 10 records whether or not anyone gives a shit.\\" The band derives their name from the 2004 film starring Rory Culkin, stating that they related to the emotional overtures of the film. \\"We felt that the tone, and the mood of the movie fit the kind of music we wanted to write.\\" Keene has said. \\"I saw the movie as being about how complicated people are, and how that can make us all feel alienated, alone, and confused a lot of the time. It can make us do crazy things, especially when you‚Äôre young and trying to figure out who you are and your place in the world.\\" Early years, Around the Bend (2007-2009) Mean Creek‚Äôs first studio record utilized just Keene & Ounjian. \\"Keene and Ounjian released the band‚Äôs debut, Around the Bend in the fall of 2007, and drummer Mikey Holland and bassist Erik Wormwood (former members of the Boston grunge outfit Tulsa) joined up in time for their sophomore effort, 2009‚Äôs The Sky (Or the Underground).\\" The complete group toured with the bands Dead Confederate and Catfish Haven in 2008. During 2009, Mean Creek appeared at the SXSW Music festival and toured with Cotton Jones, The Everyday Visuals, The Whigs, and The Features. During 2008, the band was listed as one of the \\"10 Bands to Check Out\\" by The Improper Bostonian, and was nominated for, \\"Outstanding Americana Act,\\" by the Boston Music Awards. Rising success, The Sky (Or the Underground) (2009-2010) The 2009 release of The Sky (Or Underground) garnered the band critical success and favorable reviews, including a win as \\"New Act of the Year\\" at the Boston Music Awards. The Boston Globe said that it was \\"destined to be one of the best local releases of the year.\\" In July 2010, they released their new single (The Comedian) digitally and on limited edition 7\\" vinyl, and had four of their songs featured on the popular MTV show \\"Teen Mom.\\" Later that year, the band was dubbed \\"Boston‚Äôs Best Act\\" by The Boston Phoenix and nominated for \\"Song of the Year\\" and \\"Album of the Year\\" at the 2010 Boston Music Awards. During this time, Mean Creek toured with Bettie Serveert, and again with Dead Confederate. Continued notoriety (2011) 2011 included a tour with the band Buffalo Tom, and another appearance at the SXSW Music festival. The band released a 4-song EP, Hemophiliac (produced by John Agnello, known for his work with such acts as Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr., and The Hold Steady) as well as a new single, The Land Of Hopes & Dreams. The EP was originally intended to be a full-length release, but due to a loss of funding, the band was required to scale back and ended up personally financing it. It was then distributed via Bandcamp, where fans were able to download utilizing the \\"pay what you can\\" format popularized by such artists as Radiohead and Amanda Palmer. This decision was announced through their blog, where they stated \\"We were originally planning on going into the studio to record a full length album, until about a month ago we found out that we weren‚Äôt going to have any financial support for the recording. We decided to record what we could afford to record ourselves. This release is entirely self-funded, and we want to give it away to anyone that is interested in listening. If you feel so inclined, you can 'name your own price' and pay us whatever money you see fit for it.\\" The release earned the band numerous awards and nominations including wins for \\"Best Act\\" from The Boston Phoenix, and \\"Album/EP of the Year\\" at the Boston Music Awards. As the year drew to a close, the band announced plans for their forthcoming third studio recording. Youth Companion (2012-2013) Mean Creek announced via their social networks that they had entered the recording studio on December 28, 2011 to begin recording their next full-length album at 1867 Studios with Chris McLaughlin. Tracking was completed on January 14, and mixing began on January 18. The album, named Youth Companion, was released in 2012. Local Losers (2013-2014) Almost a year after the release of Youth Companion, the band announced that they would be working on a new studio album called Local Losers. The lead single from the album, \\"Cool Town\\", was released a few months later, followed by the second single, \\"My Madeline\\", in early 2014. The album is due for release on April 8, 2014. It has also appeared that former bassist Erik Wormwood was replaced by a new member of the band, Kevin Macdonald. Erik left to focus on family and the arrival of his first child. Disbanding (2015) On May 4, 2015, the band announced they would be disbanding following a concert on July 25 at The Middle East in Boston. Following the band's split, multi instrumentalist Mikey Holland stepped out from the drums into the spotlight fronting his rock 'n' roll band The Dazies. He has released several EP's including \\"Levon Helm\\" 2015, \\"Love/Joy\\" 2015, \\"Hungover & Weird\\" 2016 with an LP \\"Panic All The Time\\" and a split 10\\" with Boston rockers Courters all due 2017.

She acted in movies like Meenakshi, where she played the lead. A contemporary of Uday Shankar, in the 1930s she staged a number of ballets in Kolkata, including Bhookh on Bengal famine which was a pioneering work in presenting contemporary themes on stage and Omar Khayyam. Timir Baran, having left Uday Shankar's team, composed music for his performances and Tapas Sen did lighting design for her productions. Personal life Born Sadhana Sen, she was the grand daughter of Keshab Chandra Sen, a social reformer and Brahmo Samaj member and daughter of Saral Sen. She later married film director Madhu Bose, son of Pramatha Nath Bose, a pioneering geologist and paleontologist in 1929.Biography IMDb. She was so popular as a glamorous heroine of the silver screen in the 1930s and 1940s that her face appeared in the Otene snow to enhance its brand value in the market during interwar years. Her younger sister Naina Devi (original name Nilina Sen) was a legendary classical singer. Her two paternal aunts were Maharanis of two well known princely states of Eastern India: Maharani Sunity Devi of Cooch Behar and Maharani Sucharu Devi of Mayurbhanj. Granddaughter of Brahmakesari Keshab Chandra Sen, Sadhona was born in a prosperous Brahmo family and received education as was common with Brahmo girls of those days. Her father was Saral Chandra Sen and she was the second of his three daughters. Her elder sister Binita was married into a royal family of Chittagong (now in Bangladesh) and settled to household life, while the youngest Nilina pursued a career in Indian Classical music and earned herself a position of eminence and was known in record circles as Naina Devi. Sadhona married Madhu Bose, film maker working in Bengal, British India, at a young age, and joined the Calcutta Art Players, a theatrical company owned by husband Modhu Bose and took part as heroine in the plays produced by the unit. Later on Sadhona joined films and played Marjina in Alibaba (1937), made in Bengali under the banner of Bharatlakshmi Pictures. This film was a runaway hit and is remembered well by film enthusiasts. Modhu Bose had earlier directed a number of films but he tasted real success with Alibaba. For Sadhona this film meant a permanent place in the history of Bengali films. This was followed with Abhinoy (Bengali-1938), another major success for the couple. They migrated to Bombay and again created history with the immensely popular Kumkum (1940), made in two languages, Hindi and Bengali and thereafter went on to create the first triple version (English, Bengali, Hindi) film of India, Rajnartaki (1941). Sadhona did come back to Calcutta for a double version Bengali movie Meenakshi (1942)with the handsome Jyoti Prakash as the hero. Going back to Bombay soon after the completion of this film where she starred in major films like Shankar Parvati, Vishkanya, Paigham and others and firmly established herself as a heroine in her own right without the backing of husband Modhu Bose. In fact they had separated by the mid forties. Sadhona started living a life of abandon, drinking and partying. She came back to calcutta after a reconciliation with Modhu Bose but had by this time lost her magic hold over the audiences and acted in films again directed by her husband like Shesher Kabita and Maa O Chhele, without much success. Sadhona was a good dancer and almost all her film successes were in dancing roles. She was also a very fine actress and singer, too. She sang her own songs in some of her films including her first Alibaba. With film offers becoming too infrequent, she formed a dance troupe of her own and made all India tours with plays like Wither now, Hunger and others and met with success again. She passed into oblivion slowly. Even in retired life she could not part with the bottle and without any income worth the name she found herself in the most difficult conditions financially. Modhu bose was ill and it was difficult to get treatment for him. She lost her husband in 1969 and had no money to sustain herself and thereafter came the greatest tragic period of her life when she had to resort to begging in the streets, in and around Park Street of calcutta. It was during this phase of her life that passers by and street walkers came across an old lady, looking distinguished, dressed in clothes that were expensive at one time but now showing the wear and tear asking for help. Some recognised her and gave her enough to go on for some days while some others gave her a rude rebuff. She took all that with a smile. Just before her death she got appointed as dance trainer in Calcutta's prestigious Star Theatre, courtesy her one time boy friend Timir Baran. She trained junior artistes for the play Janapad Badhu and once again her name featured in the newspapers in the advertisements of the play. However, the end had come very near and she passed away in September,1973. A very tragic and unfortunate way indeed for an all India star who at a time had captured the heart and imagination of millions.

American Civil War service Henry Harrison Walker resigned from the U.S. Army on May 3, 1861. He had already been appointed a captain in the infantry of the Army of the Confederate States (the regular army of the Confederate States) on March 16, 1861 or, according to other versions, was appointed to this position soon after his resignation from the U.S. Army.The March 16, 1861 date may have been a backdated date of rank to give Walker seniority over some others also appointed to the same grade. In November 1861, Walker was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the 40th Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He was promoted to colonel of the regiment in June 1862 and led the men in the Seven Days Battles. On June 27, 1862, he was wounded twice at the Battle of Gaines Mill. He was assigned to command of a convalescent camp and then to the Defenses of Richmond, Virginia between September 1862 and July 1, 1863. During the Gettysburg campaign, Walker armed hundreds of the convalescents and helped guard Richmond while almost all healthy troops were on the campaign. On July 1, 1863, Walker was promoted to brigadier general and after the Gettysburg campaign was assigned to Major General Henry Heth's division of III Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia, initially commanding Heth's former brigade, then Brigadier General James J. Archer's brigade as well, after Archer's grievous wounding. Walker served as a brigade commander under Heth until he lost his left foot in the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House on May 10, 1864. He participated in the Battle of Bristoe Station on October 14, 1863, in the Battle of Mine Run and, after serving in the Shenandoah Valley during the winter of 1864-1864, at the Battle of the Wilderness before his wounding at Spotsylvania Court House. Walker served on court martial duty in the Department of Richmond from November 7, 1864. He was assigned to the defense of the Richmond and Danville Railroad during the Siege of Petersburg from February 1865 to the evacuation of Richmond on the night of April 2, 1865 after the fall of the defenses of Petersburg, Virginia at the Battle of Five Forks and the Third Battle of Petersburg. He was reported to have brought the news of the surrender of General Robert E. Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865 to Confederate President Jefferson Davis at Danville, Virginia. Davis ordered Walker to take the Confederate troops at Danville to join the force of General Joseph E. Johnston in North Carolina but Walker apparently did not comply with the futile order or was unable to comply with it before Johnston surrendered to Union Major General William Tecumseh Sherman on April 18, 1865 (officially April 26, 1865). Walker was paroled at Richmond, Virginia on May 7, 1865. Aftermath After the Civil War, Walker moved to New Jersey and became a stockbroker. Henry Harrison Walker died at Morristown, New Jersey on March 22, 1912. He is buried in Evergreen Cemetery at Morristown.

The equation was originally published by Peter Guthrie Tait in 1888 in the form : \\\\frac{V_0 - V}{(P - P_0) V_0} = -\\\\frac{1}{V_0}\\\\frac{\\\\Delta V}{\\\\Delta P} = \\\\frac{A}{\\\\Pi + (P - P_0)} where P_0 is the reference pressure (taken to be 1 atmosphere), P is the current pressure, V_0 is the volume of fresh water at the reference pressure, V is the volume at the current pressure, and A, \\\\Pi are experimentally determined parameters.  Popular form of the Tait equation  Around 1895, the original isothermal Tait equation was replaced by Tammann with an equation of the form : -\\\\frac{1}{V}\\\\,\\\\frac{dV}{dP} = \\\\frac{A}{V (B + P)} \\\\,. The temperature- dependent version of the above equation is popularly known as the Tait equation and is commonly written as : \\\\beta = -\\\\frac{1}{V} \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial P} \\\\right )_T = \\\\frac{0.4343 C}{V(B+P)} or in the integrated form : V = V_0 - C \\\\log_{10} \\\\left(\\\\frac{B+P}{B+P_0}\\\\right) where * \\\\beta is the compressibility of the substance (often, water) (in units of bar‚àí1 or Pa) * V \\\\ is the specific volume of the substance (in units of ml/g or m3/kg) * V_0 is the specific volume at P = P_0 = 1 bar * B \\\\ and C \\\\ are functions of temperature that are independent of pressure  Pressure formula  The expression for the pressure in terms of the specific volume is : P = (B + P_0)\\\\,10^\\\\left[-\\\\cfrac{V - V_0}{C}\\\\right] - B \\\\,.

Each book entails a sci-fi twist on an old fairy tale, including Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel, and Snow White. The story takes place in a futuristic world where earthens, cyborgs, androids, and a race of moon colonists all coexist. Books Cinder Cinder is the first book in The Lunar Chronicles and second chronologically. It was published on January 3, 2012. Linh Cinder (based on Cinderella), a cyborg living with her step mother and her two stepsisters in New Beijing of the Eastern Commonwealth, works as a mechanic in a booth at the market place, where she meets Prince Kai, who requests that she fix his personal android. After Cinder's stepsister, Peony, comes into contact with the plague, Cinder is forcibly volunteered for cure testing. As a result, many previously unknown things regarding Cinder's origins surface. At the same time, tensions between Earth and Luna, a lunar colony where most of the citizens have special abilities, are rising with Prince Kai caught in the middle. Scarlet Scarlet is the second book in The Lunar Chronicles and third chronologically. It was published on February 3, 2013. Scarlet Benoit (based on Little Red Riding Hood) is the granddaughter of Michelle Benoit, a farmer and former military pilot who has suddenly disappeared. On Scarlet's journey to find her grandmother, she works hesitantly with a street fighter named Wolf, who is a genetically altered lunar warrior. Unfortunately, as Scarlet's trust for Wolf grows, his old Lunar pack puts them in unusual circumstances, testing Wolf's loyalties. Deeper connections surface as the pack's malicious intent is finally exposed. Simultaneously, Cinder joins forces with the convict, Carswell Thorne. As the search continues, Scarlet meets Cinder and becomes an ally in her plan to stop the tyranny of Queen Levana and her thaumaturge, Sybil Mira. Cress Cress is the third book in The Lunar Chronicles. It was published on February 4, 2014. Crescent Moon, or \\"Cress\\" Darnel (based on Rapunzel), is an imprisoned shell (a Lunar without special abilities and a Lunar that cannot be affected by mind manipulation) working with Sybil to help Lunar ships. Living alone on a satellite and harbouring an enormous crush on Carswell Thorne, she secretly works to sabotage the wicked Lunar queen, and eventually, Cress teams up with Cinder and becomes entangled in her plot to save Earth. As complications arise and the crew is separated, they must do everything they can to prevent a royal wedding from putting Earth into Queen Levana's hands. And all the while, the plague has begun to mutate and even the Lunars are not safe. Fairest Fairest is the fifth book in The Lunar Chronicles and first chronologically. It was published on January 27, 2015. Fairest is a prequel to the other books in the series, telling the backstory and past of Queen Levana (based on the Evil Queen from Snow White). Fairest begins when Levana is around 15 years old and covers about ten years of her life, ending about a decade before Cinder is set. Levana has grown up in a poisonous household and has a cruel older sister who has been mentally and physically abusive to her throughout her entire life. After her parents are murdered by a Lunar assassin (a shell), Levana's sister, Channary, is set to become queen. Channary's reign is short-lived, and with Channary's ascension, Levana begins an unexpected downward spiral to becoming heartless when it comes to anything but her people. She is a tyrant. Winter Winter is the fourth book in The Lunar Chronicles and fifth chronologically. It was published on November 10, 2015. Winter (based on Snow White) is Queen Levana's stepdaughter. She has lived on Luna in the palace and has been raised by her stepmother. She has seen how Levana's use of glamour has turned her into a heartless tyrant. Winter decided to never use her gift, so she has not used her Lunar \\"glamour\\" since she was twelve. A side effect of not using glamour causes loss of sanity for Lunars and Winter is afflicted with bad visions. She often sees blood on the walls of the palace. As the book goes on, her mental state starts to slowly deteriorate. Winter's only source of comfort from the hallucinations is her guard, childhood friend and crush, Jacin. Princess Winter and Scarlet become very close friends during the book. Princess Winter is admired by the Lunar people for her grace and kindness, and despite the scars that mar her face, her beauty is said to be even more breathtaking than that of her stepmother, Queen Levana. Winter despises her stepmother, and knows Levana will not approve of her feelings for Jacin. But Winter is not as weak as Levana believes her to be and she has been undermining her stepmother's wishes for years. Together with the cyborg mechanic, Cinder, and her allies, Winter might even have the power to launch a revolution and win a war that has been raging for far too long. Short story collection Stars Above Stars Above is a collection of short stories set in The Lunar Chronicles universe. It was published on February 2, 2016. It includes five novellas previously released individually and four originals: * The Keeper: A prequel to The Lunar Chronicles, showing a young Scarlet and how Princess Selene came into the care of Michelle Benoit. * Glitches: A short story that takes place before the events of Cinder about Cinder coming to live with her new family at age 11, and the death of Linh Garan, Cinder's stepfather. It was released on January 27, 2014. * The Queen's Army: A short story about Wolf and his brother Ran's past before Scarlet. It was released on November 20, 2012. * Carswell's Guide to Being Lucky: A short story detailing the incident between Carswell Thorne and Kate Fallow and the retrieval of her portscreen mentioned in Cress. A glimpse at the young Carswell Thorne, his family life, and his teenage years. It was released on February 4, 2014. * After Sunshine Passes By: A prequel to Cress, showing how a nine-year-old Cress ended up alone on a satellite, spying on Earth for Luna. * The Princess and The Guard: A short story about Winter and Jacin's friendship during their childhood. * The Little Android: A retelling of The Little Mermaid that takes place before the events of Cinder. It was released on January 27, 2014. * The Mechanic: A short story about the first meeting of Linh Cinder and Prince Kaito, from Kaito's perspective. * Something Old, Something New: A short story set about 2 years after Winter during Scarlet and Wolf's wedding, in which Kai proposes to Cinder.  Reception  The series is the retelling of old fairytales where the female protagonists were themselves the passive participants. Due to the portrayal of strong female characters as an alternate to the conventional fairytale characters throughout its four books, this series is now considered as a part of the Feminist literature. Sequel Wires and Nerves is a graphic novel series written by Meyer also based in the world of The Lunar Chronicles. Set after the events of the Lunar Chronicles but before the Stars Above epilogue, it features many of the same characters, with Iko as the protagonist. The first book, Wires and Nerve, Volume 1, illustrated by Douglas Holgate, was released on January 31, 2017. The second book, Wires and Nerve, Volume 2, illustrated by Stephen Gilpin, was released on January 30, 2018.

He lives in Ibadan. He has declared himself to be a Living Perfect Master, Guru Maharaj Ji, and is also called the \\"Black Jesus\\". He says that he has power over all illnesses and all problems affecting humanity. Biography Ji was born in Oyo State, Nigeria. He worked for Nigeria Airways and travelled between Africa and London. Ji leads a communitarian group with various names, such as One Love Family; the One Love Mission; One Love, One Family; and the Divine Love Family. The group has an ashram, \\"Satguru Maharaj Ji Village\\", on a lonely stretch of the Ibadan-Lagos Expressway near Ibadan. Its members are vegetarians and wear badges as signs of their loyalty. In 1989, former members claimed that 200 bodies were buried around the ashram. Ji was arrested, but the charges were dropped when no bodies were found. In 1999, the ashram was burned down by youths connected to the Iju Youths Progressive Union who were angered by the alleged killing of a Ghanaian man by devotees. Ji was charged with the crime along with twelve of his disciples, and was kept in jail for several months. He was again acquitted in 2000. While incarcerated he received an average of 25 visitors a day. The judge criticized the prosecution for its lack of diligence. A state governor tried to shut down the ashram and acquire the property, but Ji was able to prove ownership in court. In 2000, he asserted that a visit by US President Bill Clinton to Nigeria was part of an American plan to open a military base in Nigeria and to take control of Africa. In 2003, he said the re-election of Olusegun Obasanjo as president of Nigeria was part of a \\"Golden Change\\", for which he was responsible. In 2004, he predicted that John Kerry would defeat George W. Bush. The same year he held a press conference warning church leaders to use contributions in accordance with biblical principles, such as feeding the poor, or else they would face the wrath of God. At a press conference in 2008, he expressed his strong support for Nuhu Ribadu as chair of Nigeria's anti- corruption Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), saying, \\"The fight against corruption must be seen as a genuine effort to stabilize Nigeria and give meaning to all\\". During the Coronavirus pandemic in 2020, Ji at a press conference said Nigerians must move away from religion and the \\"Holy Ghost syndrome\\" and embrace divine knowledge instead in order to win the fight against the pandemic. Those who have sought spiritual guidance from him include Mohammed Abacha and Hamza al-Mustapha.

A part of the War in Afghanistan, it involved a force of 1,100 troops, including 750 or 800 members of the French Foreign Legion, 200 United States Special Forces and Afghan National Army (ANA) soldiers. Background Sixteen months before the operation, the Uzbin Valley ambush, on August 18, 2008, by the Taliban in the area of Surobi, Afghanistan, had killed ten French soldiers and wounded twenty-one. Goals The operation's purpose was \\"reaffirming the sovereignty of Afghan security forces in the north of the Uzbeen Valley\\", according to a French military spokesperson, as well as to plant the Afghan flag in what was called a key strategic village. (While 75 percent of the Uzbin Valley had been under ISAF control, the rest of the valley had been under the control of the Taliban.) Fighting During more than 90 minutes of combat, several US soldiers were wounded, including three serious injuries. The Taliban fighters attacked with rocket-propelled grenades, mortars and heavy machine gun fire; for the coalition forces, the French troops used shells, backed up by French Tigre and US Apache helicopters and fighter jets. At least one Taliban fighter was killed and three were injured, according to Lieutenant-Colonel Herv√© Wallerand, who led the operation. Strategy The French employed what was called the \\"Mikado strategy\\" (la strat√©gie du Mikado), after the game Mikado (known in North America as \\"pick-up sticks\\"), because of the need to plan every move carefully with constant awareness that one wrong step could risk everything being lost. In particular, the Mikado strategy emphasizes consulting with local inhabitants in a shura (or consultation) to minimize the risk of local civilians conspiring against the ANA and ISAF forces. For this reason the operation was preceded by \\"weeks of negotiations with local villagers\\", according to the BBC News. Aftermath In July 2011, the Croix de la Valeur Militaire (\\"cross of military valour\\"), a French military decoration, was presented to five Americans ‚Äì Cpt. Thomas Harper, Master Sgt.

Moraingy (Malagasy) or Moringue (French) is a weaponless, bare-fisted striking style of traditional martial art that originated during the Maroseranana dynasty (1675‚Äì1896) of the Sakalava Kingdom of western coastal Madagascar. It has since become popularized throughout Madagascar, but particularly in coastal regions, and has spread to neighboring Indian Ocean islands including R√©union, Mayotte, Comoros, Seychelles and Mauritius. Participation in this form of combat was originally limited to young men, allowing elders to judge their physical fitness and strength while providing an opportunity for the youth to gain prestige and test their abilities. Today, while the average age of participants is still between 10 and 35, young people of both genders may practice the sport. Participants are called kidabolahy (young men) or kidabo mpanao moraingy (young people who practice moraingy) and are widely respected and even feared by fellow villagers. In the North, they are called Fagnorolahy, and the assistants, magnafo. Moraingy matches must by tradition be accompanied by music (often salegy) to induce a trance-like state in the fighters and participants, contributing to the spiritual and communal experience of the fight. As part of this experience, participants typically engage in dances during and between the matches that are meant to provoke the supporters of the opposing party, while the crowd cheers and jeers loudly.Ratsimbazafy (2010), pp. 14-18 Fighting style A typical moraingy competition consists of a series of matches pitting two fighters, typically from different villages, against one another. Prior to the fight, all the fighters parade around in the outdoor arena (typically a soccer field) to size up and select their potential adversaries, while the spectators who ring the field cheer, sing and attempt to provoke the fighters. The matches are announced and each clan sings its own chant in support of the fighter from its village. Each match lasts only one round and ends when one of the fighters exits the arena, faints, is no longer able to defend himself, is clearly unequal to the other, or is determined to be seriously injured. The judges of the match declare a victor and no contesting of the determination is permitted; both participants are cheered by the spectators for their efforts in the match. Moraingy is considered a half-distance or long-range fighting sport with punches predominating but with some kicks permitted. Types of punches include straight punches (mitso), hooks (mandraoky), downward slanting punches (vangofary) and a punch similar to an uppercut (vangomioriky). Defenses include guarding and sidesteps, but neither the attacks nor defenses are standardized, creating higher variability among individual fighters and between regions than in international boxing.  Spread  Although moraingy is primarily concentrated in the coastal regions of Madagascar where it was historically popularized, Malagasy migrants took the sport with them when traveling overseas. In Reunion Island, a French territory 500 kilometers east of Madagascar, where a large number of Malagasy people were brought by the French to work as slave laborers on sugar plantations, the sport took root under the name moringue, or batay kreol. Originally limited to the laborer's quarters of the sugar plantations, in 2005 it was recognized by the Reunion government as an official sport of the island. The popularization of the sport is in part due to a growing acknowledgement of the Malagasy and African origins of the island's Creole community. The Reunionais form of moraingy is less violent and more inspired by the choreography and acrobatics of Brazilian capoeira than the original Malagasy form. The use of jumps and stomping makes it spectacular. As in Madagascar, music is played throughout moringue matches, typically consisting of percussion or Reunionais maloya music. The government recognition of the sport was intended to foster a sense of pride and identity for the large Creole youth population of Reunion island. Moringue is now organized like other mainstream sports, with about 1000 licencees, and receives local media attention. The most celebrated Reunionais moringue athlete is Jean-Rene Dreinaza.

It is the first volume of a three-volume work, also referred to by the same title, which is modeled after John Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion (1536). Together with Rushdoony's other writings, the book is the basis of Christian reconstructionism. Summary Rushdoony expounds the Ten Commandments, adopting a theonomic perspective. He maintains that almost all of the Old Testament civil law is normative for civil governments. Rushdoony provides an outline of a program for establishing a Christian theocracy. Reception The theologian John Frame gave The Institutes of Biblical Law a mixed review in Westminster Theological Journal, writing that the book convinced him that \\"Rushdoony is one of the most important Christian social critics alive today\\", but also criticizing it on various grounds. Frame credited Rushdoony with cogently arguing against attempts to replace scripture with natural law, with showing a broad and deep knowledge of scripture, and with \\"a remarkably detailed grasp of the historical background and present condition of human culture.\\" However, he found the book \\"a bit rough-hewn\\", noting that it \\"began as a series of lectures\\" and in some respects still resembles one, and that it contained \\"considerable repetition\\". Overall, Frame concluded that the book had \\"great strengths and great weaknesses\\", noting that he had tried \\"to keep this review balanced between strong praise and strong criticism.\\" The journalist M. Stanton Evans described The Institutes of Biblical Law as \\"a work of prodigious scope and erudition\\" and a \\"thoughtful book\\" in National Review. Joe Bageant suggests that if the United States experiences a fourth \\"Great Awakening\\", historians may one day \\"document it as beginning in 1973 with the publication of R. J. Rushdoony's seminal The Institutes of Biblical Law.\\" Peter Montgomery of the Public Eye Magazine describes The Institutes of Biblical Law as Rushdoony's \\"magnum opus\\", and identifies it and Rushdoony's other writings as providing the basis for Christian reconstructionism.

Family and early life The son of Richard Eliot (1546 ‚Äì 22 June 1609) and Bridget Carswell (c. 1542 ‚Äì March 1617), he was born at Cuddenbeak, a farm on his father's Port Eliot estate in St Germans, Cornwall. He was baptised on 20 April at St German's Priory, immediately next to Port Eliot. The Eliot family were an old Devon family that had settled in Cornwall. John Eliot was educated at Blundell's School, Tiverton, and matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, on 4 December 1607, and, leaving the university after three years, he studied law at one of the Inns of Court. He also spent some months travelling in France, Spain and Italy, in company, for part of the time, with young George Villiers, afterwards 1st Duke of Buckingham. Parliamentary career Eliot was only twenty-two when he began his parliamentary career as Member of Parliament for St Germans in the \\"Addled Parliament\\" of 1614. In May 1618, he was knighted, and next year through the patronage of Buckingham he obtained the appointment of Vice-Admiral of Devon, with large powers for the defence and control of the commerce of the county. It was not long before the characteristic energy with which he performed the duties in his office involved him in difficulties. After many attempts, in 1623, he succeeded by a clever but dangerous manoeuvre in entrapping the famous pirate John Nutt, who had for years plagued the southern coast, inflicting immense damage upon English commerce. However, the pirate, having a powerful protector at court in Sir George Calvert, the secretary of state, was pardoned; while the Vice-Admiral, upon charges which could not be substantiated, was flung into the Marshalsea prison, and detained there nearly four months. A few weeks after his release, Eliot was elected Member of Parliament for NewportConrad Russell, 'Eliot, Sir John (1592‚Äì1632)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edn, October 2006 accessed 16 December 2007 (February 1624). On 27 February, he delivered his first speech, in which he at once revealed his great powers as an orator, demanding boldly that the liberties and privileges of Parliament, repudiated by James I in the former Parliament, should be secured. In the first Parliament of Charles I, in 1625, he urged the enforcement of the laws against the Roman Catholics. Meanwhile, he had continued the friend and supporter of Buckingham and greatly approved of the war with Spain. Buckingham's incompetence, however, and the bad faith with which both he and the King continued to treat the parliament, alienated Eliot. Distrust of his former friend quickly grew in Eliot's mind to a certainty of his criminal ambition. Returned to the parliament of 1626 as Member for St Germans and in the absence of other leaders of the opposition whom the King had secured by nominating them sheriffs, Eliot found himself the leader of the House. He immediately demanded an inquiry into the recent disaster at C√°diz. On 27 March, he made an open and daring attack upon Buckingham and his administration. He was not intimidated by the King's threatening intervention on 29 March, and persuaded the House to defer the actual grant of the subsidies and to present a remonstrance to the King, declaring its right to examine the conduct of ministers. On 8 May, he was one of the managers who carried Buckingham's impeachment to the Lords and, on 10 May, he delivered the charges against him, comparing him in the course of his speech to Sejanus. Next day, Eliot was sent to the Tower. When the Commons declined to proceed with business as long as Eliot and Sir Dudley Digges (who had been imprisoned with him) were in confinement, they were released, and Parliament was dissolved on 15 June. Eliot was immediately dismissed from his office of Vice- Admiral of Devon, and, in 1627, he was again imprisoned for refusing to pay a forced loan, but liberated shortly before the assembling of the Parliament of 1628, to which he was returned as Member for Cornwall. He joined in the resistance now organised to arbitrary taxation, was foremost in the promotion of the Petition of Right, continued his outspoken censure of Buckingham, and after the latter's assassination in August, led the attack, in the session of 1629, on the ritualists and Arminians. In February the great question of the right of the King to levy tonnage and poundage came up for discussion. On the King ordering an adjournment of Parliament, the speaker, Sir John Finch, was held down in the chair by Denzil Holles and Benjamin Valentine while Eliot's resolutions against illegal taxation and innovations in religion were read to the House. In consequence, Eliot, with eight other members, was imprisoned on 4 March in the Tower. He refused to answer in his examination, relying on his parliamentary privilege and, on 29 October, was again sent to the Marshalsea. On 26 January, he appeared at the bar of the King's Bench, in front of Lord Chief Justice Sir Nicholas Hyde, with Holles and Valentine, to answer a charge of conspiracy to resist the King's order, and refusing to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the court (see R v. Eliot, Hollis and Valentine.) He was fined ¬£2000 and ordered to be imprisoned during the King's pleasure and till he had made submission. This he steadfastly refused. While some of the prisoners appear to have had certain liberty allowed to them, Eliot's confinement in the Tower was made exceptionally severe. Charles's anger had always been directed chiefly against him, not only as his own political antagonist but also as the prosecutor and bitter enemy of Buckingham; \\"an outlawed man,\\" he described him, \\"desperate in mind and fortune.\\" Death and burial In the spring of 1632, he fell into a decline. In October he petitioned Charles for permission to go into the country, but leave could be obtained only at the price of submission and was finally refused. He died of consumption on 27 November 1632, and was buried at St Peter's Ad Vincula Church within the Tower. When his son requested permission to move the body to St Germans, Charles refused, saying: \\"Let Sir John Eliot be buried in the church of that parish where he died.\\" The suspicious manner of Eliot's death, as the result of the King's implacability and severe treatment, had more effect, probably, than any other single incident in embittering and precipitating the dispute between King and parliament. Eliot was a great orator, inspired by enthusiasm and high ideals, which he was able to communicate to his hearers by his eloquence. In 1668, the House of Lords reversed his conviction, restating the law in Strode's case, affirming that the conviction \\"...was an illegal judgment, and against the freedom and privilege of Parliament\\". Works Eliot languished in prison for some time, during which he wrote several works: *Negotium posterorum, an account of the parliament in 1625; *The Monarchie of Man, a political treatise; *De jure majestatis, a Political Treatise of Government, which is in large part a summary of a work by Henning Arnisaeus;J. P. Sommerville, Politics and Ideology in England 1603‚Äì1640 (1986), p. 158. *An Apology for Socrates, his own defence. Family In 1611, Eliot married Radigund (or Rhadagund), (c. 1595 ‚Äì June 1628), daughter of Richard Gedie of Trebursye in Cornwall, by whom he had five sons and four daughters: # John Eliot (18 October 1612 ‚Äì March 1685), who married Honora Norton # Richard Eliot (c. 1614 ‚Äì unknown) # Elizabeth Eliot (c. December 1616 ‚Äì unknown), who married Nathaniel Fiennes # Edward Eliot (c. July 1618 ‚Äì 1710), who married Anna Fortescue # Bridget Eliot (c. April 1620 ‚Äì unknown), who married Peter Fortescue # Radigunda Eliot (c. October 1622 ‚Äì unknown) # Susanna Eliot (c. October 1624 ‚Äì unknown), who married Edward Norton # Thomas Eliot (c. September 1626 ‚Äì unknown) # Nicholas Eliot (c. June 1628 ‚Äì unknown), who married a Miss Prideaux The current Earls of St Germans (1815 creation) are descended from the youngest son, Nicholas. Richard Eliot Richard Eliot was the wayward second son of Sir John Eliot and Rhadigund Geddy. Richard went to the University of Oxford at his father's suggestion, but did not fare well with academic life. He became embroiled at Oxford in various difficulties, which are mentioned without further detail in his father's writings. Further problems ensued when Richard failed or refused to visit his father in the Tower. As a result, Richard seems to have disappeared compared to his siblings. It is known that he went to the Low Countries under Sir Edward Howard around February 1632. Richard died before 1669 when his brothers, John and Edward, argued over the inheritance of Richard's lands in Cornwall. General Granville Elliott (1713 - 1759) spent much time and effort trying to prove that Richard Eliot had married Catherine Killigrew (1618 - 1689), and had a child George Elliott born around 1636. However, documents survive that show that Richard died 'ob cael', i.e. a bachelor, and that, in 1656, Catherine was known as a spinster aged 38. It is likely, however, that George Elliott was the illegitimate son of Richard and Catherine. References Sources * Life of Sir J.

Smolensko raced for two years and was retired to stud in 1815. He stood for seven years for his breeder, Charles Bunbury, and spent the remainder of his stud career in Surrey and Suffolk. Before his death at age 19 in 1829, he sired the filly Gulnare (winner of the 1827 Epsom Oaks) and the colt Jerry (winner of the 1824 St. Leger Stakes). Background Smolensko was foaled in 1810 at Barton Hall near Bury St. Edmunds, the ancestral home of his breeder Charles Bunbury. His sire, Sorcerer, was also bred by Bunbury and was a half-brother of the 1801 Derby winning mare Eleanor. Sorcerer was a large black horse that was a successful racer and sire. Smolensko's dam, Wowski, was bred by Sir Ferdinando Poole, owned by Mr Hallett, and was a half-sister of the important sire Waxy. Another of Wowski's offspring was Smolensko's full-brother Thunderbolt, a successful racer but short-lived sire. Wowski produced thirteen foals between 1802 and 1822. Smolensko was her fifth foal and she produced seven full-brothers to Smolensko who all inherited the black coat of their parents. Smolensko was a black colt with a coat mixed with a \\"few white hairs,\\" a small white star and a sock on his right hind foot. He was \\"about sixteen and a half hands high\\" and had a calm and docile temperament. A German count visiting Sir Charles in 1818 described him as, \\"... a brilliant animal with a beautiful high and formed neck and excellent shoulders and withers. His legs on contrary are in proportion to rest of the body rather longer than those of his father and his arms and hocks are not so broad as those of his parent however notwithstanding his considerable performances his legs are perfectly free from all blemishes.\\" Racing career Smolensko did not run as a two-year-old. In his two-year racing career, he ran eight times and won seven races, finishing third once and forfeiting a race due to injury. His most important wins were in the 1813 Epsom Derby and 2,000 Guineas Stakes. He ran only twice as a four-year-old before being retired to Bunbury's stud in 1815. 1813: three-year-old season Spring On the first start of Smolensko's racing career at the First Spring Meeting at Newmarket, he won the 2,000 Guineas Stakes on 4 May, beating The Oaks winning filly Music and nine other horses. The next day, Smolensko won the Newmarket Stakes from the filly Scheherazade in a ten horse field that included the fillies Music and Wilful (sired by Waxy). Summer On 3 June, Smolensko started in the Derby Stakes held at Epsom against a field of eleven other horses. Before the race, Smolensko was paraded before the assembled crowd and there \\"was a burst of admiration on all sides\\" with Sporting Magazine commenting on his \\"fine eye, the splendid symmetry of his limbs, the grace and power of his action and his perfect docility\\" before the race. Smolensko bruised the sole of one of his hooves during a training run on the Friday before the Derby and his regular shoes were replaced with solid metal plates for the running. At three o'clock, the race began with Smolensko soon taking the lead, followed closely by Lord Jersey's colt Caterpillar. At Tadnor's Point (Tattenham Corner, a sharp turn in the track) Caterpillar took the lead from Smolensko, but one hundred yards from the finish, Smolensko, under jockey Goodisson's command, \\"shot past Caterpillar like lightning, winning easily by a length.\\" The excitement of Smolensko's Derby win led to a few accidents in the crowd with commentary in Sporting Magazine reporting that, \\"Many falls took place, some few persons were run over, and of consequence a few accidents occurred.\\" In the most serious occurrence, \\"a phaeton was unfortunately overthrown, and a lady who was in it much injured, and a gentleman who endeavoured to prevent the accident, had his arm broken.\\" At Egham on 25 August, Smolensko won the 175-guinea Magna Charta Stakes from the Duke of York's colt Eurus. Autumn At the First October Meeting at Newmarket, Smolensko finished third in a ¬£96 sweepstakes race to the colts The Corporal and Macedonian. He was injured during the race, straining \\"one of his back sinews.\\" With Smolensko still recovering from his injury at Newmarket, his connections forfeited an 18 October match race with the colt Benedict, paying 80 guineas to Lord Foley. On 1 November at the Houghton Meeting, Smolensko beat Grosvenor's colt Redmond in a match race. 1814: four-year-old season Smolensko only started twice in 1814. At the Newmarket-Craven meeting on 12 April, Smolensko won a match race against the colt Tiger. At the First Spring Meeting on 29 April at Newmarket, Smolensko won a 450-guinea sweepstakes race against four other horses, beating the colts Pyramus and Punic. Smolensko retired from racing in 1814 and became a breeding stallion for Charles Bunbury the following year. Stud career Smolensko was retired to stud in 1815 and stood at Great Barton until 1 March when he was relocated to the Oatlands stud in Surrey where he commanded a 20-guinea stud fee and a 1-guinea groom fee. Charles Bunbury died on 31 March 1821, and upon his death, the landlord (Nathaniel Garland) of one of Bunbury's leased estates claimed 14 horses from Bunbury's stable as a heriot. Smolensko had recently been sent to a stable in Yorkshire and was not present at Barton Hall during the incident. Garland later sued in court for the right to claim and include Smolensko as one of the 14 horses in the heriot. The court ruled that since Smolensko was not initially included in the list, Garland did not have a right to him stating: \\"in consequence of the bailiff's saying he had enough when he took the list, the horse Smolensko is therefore not included.\\" Smolensko was bought after Bunbury's death in 1821 by Richard Wilson for approximately 1,300 guineas and was relocated to Bildeston, Suffolk. Wilson sold Smolensko to John Theobald and he was relocated to Stockwell, Surrey where he stood for 10 guineas per mare and a half guinea groom's fee. Smolensko died on 10 January 1829 at the age of 19 yearsStaff.

Unlike the Sea Cloud, the Sea Cloud II is a newbuilding. The contract for her construction was awarded to the Spanish shipbuilder Astilleros Gond√°n, SA. The keel laying was held there on 24 June 1998. The rigging was planned and produced by Navicom in Wolgast. The 23 sails were made in Poland. Sea Cloud II was launched on 18 March 1999. However, the owner's exacting demands in relation to interior fitout caused delivery problems and personnel problems. This led to a roughly one-year delay. The ship was eventually handed over to Sea Cloud Cruises on 29 December 2000, in a not yet completely finished state. On 22 January 2001, the final work was completed. The Sea Cloud II was christened on 6 February 2001 in Las Palmas, Canary Islands. The sponsor was Sabine Christiansen. Description Hull The Sea Cloud II has an overall length of . Her maximum beam is and her draught is described as . Her hull is built of standard shipbuilding steel, and is fitted with eight watertight bulkheads. Three of the Sea Cloud II's decks are continuous. She has a , and is equipped with three anchors, weighing a total of . Decks The ship has five decks. The bridge deck is used as a sun deck behind the superstructure. Below it is the main deck, which is called the lido deck. It has a bar, lounge, the Owner Suites and the library. The promenade deck, or first sub-deck, houses the reception area, restaurant, boutique, and the junior suites. Outside the windows of the suites is a promenade; no balconies are available. Externally, the Sea Cloud II is recognizable by the long \\"cutouts\\" in her hull. The cabin deck is the second sub-deck. As its name suggests, it houses the cabins, but also a fitness room, sauna and a room for medical care. On the lowest deck are cabins for the crew members, along with the kitchen and other service facilities. A freight elevator connects the decks. There is no pool aboard the Sea Cloud II. Instead, she has a foldable platform, which facilitates sea-based watersports. Cabins and suites In the cabins and suites, a maximum of 96 passengers can be accommodated. The interior of the Sea Cloud II is air conditioned, and in the cabins and suites, the temperature can be regulated. There are 27 outside cabins with portholes. By price category, the room sizes range from to . They are always equipped with two beds, and a TV, safe, shower, toilet and marble vanity tops with gold-plated taps, amongst other features. In the three interior cabins, the lowest category, there are bunk beds. The 16 \\"junior suites\\" are in size, and are equipped with large windows. They also have more luxurious furnishings and interior decorations. The bathrooms are slightly larger than in the cabins and have a bath. The two so-called \\"owner suites\\" differ from the \\"junior suites\\" by having a room size of , more extensive furnishings (including a four-poster bed) and a much larger bathroom with tub and separate shower. Sea Cloud II in Pula, Croatia, 2011. Rigging The Sea Cloud II is a square-rigger with fore-mast, main-mast and mizzen-mast. The top of her main-mast is above deck. Her 23 sails have a total area of approximately . She is sailed traditionally by hand, as is common, for example, on sail training ships. Machinery The vessel's main power plants consist of two four-stroke diesel engines made by Krupp MaK Maschinenbau GmbH, each developing at 900 revolutions/minute. The propeller is driven via a gear mechanism. Using this means of propulsion, the Sea Cloud II achieves a top speed of about 13 knots. Additionally, she is equipped with a bow thruster. Three main generators developing a total of generate the on-board voltage of 380/220 V AC, 50 Hz. There is also a emergency generator. Service history Cruise regions The Sea Cloud II sails mainly in the Mediterranean in summer and in the Caribbean in winter. Her Atlantic crossings between these two regions are also marketed as cruises. Rating Comfort, service and cuisine are at the highest level on the Sea Cloud II. In 2004, the Berlitz Complete Guide to Cruising & Cruise Ships therefore gave her a five star rating.

It was used by Native Americans to reach Ute Pass and was an area that oxen trains traveled to reach Colorado Springs. Templeton Ranch was operated by A.J. Templeton, for whom the feature is named. During heavy rains, water pools in a basin about the city and funnels through the gap and has resulted in devastating floods. The Templeton Gap Floodway was built in 1949 to divert waters and reduce the likelihood of flooding. The city operates a trail named Templeton Gap trail. Geography Templeton Gap is a narrow outlet below a semicircular range of rocky hills that is about higher in elevation than the city of Colorado Springs. It is located between the hills and bluffs north of the intersection of Union Boulevard and Austin Bluffs Parkway. History The main trail used by Native Americans to cross into the mountains by Pike's Peak was through Templeton Gap, across Monument Creek, across the Mesa, and then down to and along Fountain Creek to the present Manitou Springs. From there, it joined the original Ute Pass trail. Templeton Gap is named for A.J. (Jack) Templeton who operated a ranch and helped deliver babies, colts, and calves in Templeton Gap beginning in the 1860s. Templeton signed up to fight against Native Americans at Sand Creek in 1864 (Sand Creek massacre). It was through this gap that many oxen wagon trains entered into Colorado Springs. A road through Templeton Gap was the most direct route to get lumber from Pinery, now Black Forest. In the 1860s, it was one of the few locations in the state of Colorado that began to collect and document weather information. Others were Fountain, Colorado City, Golden, and Fort Morgan, Colorado. The project was sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution, and led by Joseph Henry, the first federal meteorologist. In 1871, the observer was A. M. Merriam, who sheared 3,200 sheep the following year. In the 1880s, large herds of sheep were raised in Templeton Gap. In 1922, there was significant hail and rain that flowed through Templeton Gap and flooded Papeton with four feet of water. It destroyed barns, fences, and roads in Papeton and railroad tracks beyond Papeton. It was estimated to be the worst storm to hit Templeton Gap in 50 years. A more severe flood occurred in July 1932. The Colorado Springs Country Club was built on Templeton Gap Road on property originally the site of the McKnight Dairy Farm. It was chartered as a member-owned country club in 1954. Floodway The Templeton Gap Floodway is a levee to Monument Creek from just east of Union Boulevard in the Pikeview neighborhood. It was built in 1949 by the US Army Corps of Engineers to divert floodwater away from Shooks Run, which flows to Fountain Creek, to Monument Creek. The floodway was seen as a way of mitigating significant floods, such as those in the late 1800s and early 1900s that had done significant damage to the city. It is owned and maintained by the City of Colorado Springs and is designed to carry 13,500 cubic feet of flood water per second. Trail The Templeton Gap Trail crosses through Templeton Gap, connects with Sinton Trail, and connects to the Pikes Peak Greenway, Palmer Park, the Greencrest trail, Goose Gossage Sports Complex, Portal Park, and the Union Meadows Open Space. The trail begins at a trail head for the Greencrest Trail on the north side of Palmer Park and ends at the Goose Gossage Sports Complex.

Biography Legend says that he was born in his father‚Äôs boathouse at Putney, but he was actually born close to Lambert Pier in London. He spent his whole life on or by the Thames, and became a waterman's apprentice in 1882, which was the year he won the Putney Badge. In 1887, Bill won the Doggett's Coat and Badge Race, and in 1891, he won the English Sculling Championship. However he never defended this title. He also stroked in the winning Champion Fours in the National Regattas of 1890 and 1891, and also won the Champion Pairs. Seven years later, in 1898, he was appointed a waterman to Queen Victoria. He retired from professional sculling about 1903/04. In June 1906, he became the Royal Bargemaster to King Edward VII. Bill seems to have been a very popular person on the Thames and was early on connected to Cambridge University Boat Club, to train and coach the crews. In 1904, he published the ‚Äòhow-to‚Äô book Rowing and Sculling. Bill East coached Trinity Hall‚Äôs famous rower and sculler, the American Benjamin Hunting Howell to victories in the Wingfield Sculls in 1898 and 1899; the same years Howell also won the Diamond Challenge Sculls at Henley-on-Thames. Like many other champion scullers he later in life became a publican. He ran the Prince‚Äôs Head hotel and then the Pigeon Hotel at Richmond. Bill East died in December 1932.

Background and education Ritchie's parents moved to Hallandale, Florida from the Caribbean where his father had owned a fruit stand. His father died before Ritchie completed high school. At the age of 17, he enrolled in Florida A & M University (FAMU), where he became founder and editor of the school newspaper. The great depression of 1929 derailed his college career. He dropped out of college and joined a local band that went on the road, with him playing banjo. In Chicago, Illinois, he met his wife Edith and they had their only child, George. Long after the band stopped, the family remained in Chicago. Ritchie worked odd jobs for a few years and eventually got a job as a porter in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1933, he got a job in Massillon, Ohio, working at Republic Steel. By 1942 he was back in school, this time at the predominantly White Kent State University in Ohio. He initially studied pre-law but switched to sociology and graduated in 1946, with a B.S. in Sociology, while working a full-time job at a steel mill in Massillon. Career He immediately enrolled in a graduate program at Kent and so impressed the chairman of the Sociology department, James T. Laing, that he was given a teaching position in 1947, taking over from former faculty member Harley Preston. He was working as a full-time faculty member, something that was quite unusual for a graduate student. During the summer of 1947 he attended the Yale Institute of Alcoholic Studies on a scholarship and earned enough transferable credits to graduate from Kent State that summer.Oscar Ritchie's Master of Arts diploma, issued by Kent State University, August 29, 1947. He made such an impression on the Yale faculty that his master's thesis, \\"A Sociological Analysis of Alcoholics Anonymous,\\"Quarterly Journal of Studies on Alcohol, Vol. 9, 119-156, 1948. \\"A Sociological Analysis of Alcoholics Anonymous\\", Oscar W. Ritchie, M.A. was published in the Yale Quarterly Journal of Alcoholic Studies. By fall 1947, Ritchie was appointed full-time faculty member in the Sociology Department, then located in Lowry Hall. This appointment made him the first African American faculty member at a predominantly White university in the state of Ohio. University president Bowman, liberal as he may have been in making Ritchie's appointment to the faculty, considered the NAACP to be \\"a radical organization\\", and refused to allow the students to form a local chapter in 1954. The university had its own discriminatory housing policies, which Ritchie fought and eventually forced the university to change in 1963. The Sociology and English departments led the way by protesting and threatening to walk out, finally prevailing. Scholarship Ritchie received a scholarship to the Yale Institute of Alcoholic Studies. He was awarded the Julius Rosenwald Scholarship in 1948, which is given \\"solely for the well-being of mankind.\\" He was the first Kent State graduate to win this award. He also received the Guggenheim Award awarded to graduate students for advanced study. On his way to achieving his doctorate, Ritchie took a year off from Kent State and studied at the University of Wisconsin after which, in 1949, he resumed his academic duties and he gave the Scholarship Day address in May 1952. Ritchie received his PhD in Sociology from New York University in 1958. His dissertation was titled \\"Male Delinquents' Assessments of an Industrial School: A Study of the Relationship between Assessments and Length of Residence.\\" He summarizes his study in the following manner in the dissertation's abstract (L.C. Card No. Mic 58-7262). Shortly before his death, he was elected by his colleagues to the chairmanship of the Sociology Department. Mentorship Ritchie was not averse to interacting with the student body and worked with a number of the Greek organizations on campus as an adviser, including Kappa Alpha Psi and Alpha Phi Alpha fraternities, which he advised from 1955 to 1956 and 1958-1962 respectively. He also assisted in the establishment of the Alpha Phi Alpha Education Foundation, which offered a scholarship as early as 1965.\\"Cash for College Careers.\\" Ebony Magazine, April 1965, Vol. 20, No. 6: 42. His work with the Alphas won him the honor of being named Director of Educational Activities for Alpha Phi Alpha's national chapter, an appointment he held from 1966 until his death in 1967. Community involvement Ritchie was a lifelong musician. Although he did not play with a band as he had in Florida, he did direct musical groups, outside of the university. From reports in the local papers it appears that he revived the Massillon Community Chorus in 1938, which developed into a full-blown 40-member choir by 1941. During that three-year period they toured more than 50 Ohio cities. The group was \\"composed of mill workers, garage mechanics, house maids, and WPA laborers.\\"\\"Massillon Negro Chorus On WHBC Today.\\" Canton Repository, January 12, 1941: 25. The amateur chorus donated all of their earnings to the Urban League \\"for the purchase of music, choir robes and a recording machine.\\" With his wife Edith in the choir and him on piano, he managed to keep his musical ambitions alive by presenting Negro spirituals a la Frederick and Harriet Loudin of the neighboring town of Ravenna, Ohio, who led the Fisk Jubilee Singers, for nearly 30 years. In concert with some of his colleagues at Kent State he also co-founded the Portage County Family Planning, Counseling and Mental Health Center in Ravenna, Ohio, with Dr. Dwight I. Arnold, a KSU Emeritus professor, and Dr. John Guidabaldi (Chairman, Associate Professor, Early Childhood Ed.), in 1962. He was also an active member of the Massillon Urban League and the Canton NAACP, which recognized his work as the leader of their local recruitment drive in the 1950s, that nearly doubled the size of their local membership. Considering the attitude of KSU President Bowman towards these types of organizations, these were bold moves. He was also involved with protests against housing discrimination on the Kent State campus, a feature of university policy, and discrimination off campus in Kent and surrounding communities. Ritchie also spoke out about injustices in the juvenile justice system. Recognition and legacy In recognition of his 29 years' service to the university a building on the Kent University campus was named the Oliver W Ritchie Hall on June 16, 1967. The Oscar W. Ritchie Four-Year Scholarship Fund was established in 1977 with an endowment of $450,000. It grants $2,000 to $8,000 per year to qualifying African American students who intend to attend Kent State University. A grant of $250 is made to all applicants. Death Ritchie died on June 16, 1967, in Ravenna, Ohio's Robinson Memorial Hospital, of lesions on the liver and lung. He was survived by his wife Edith, brother Alfred, sister Mary, son George and three grandchildren, Jocelyn, Victoria, and Bradford. Published journal articles * Ritchie, O.W.

While a teenager, he became a notorious horse thief in the area. He was convicted and sentenced to serve time on Cockatoo Island near Sydney, where he met Frank Gardiner. In December 1860, Peisley gained his ticket of leave, on the condition that he remain in the Hunter River Valley area.

Two parties were formed: Bright and Hall went to the back of the hut and were stationed in the creek, while Hales and King were stationed at the front of the hut. :As Hales and King approached the hut, the dogs started barking. Bushrangers ran out the back of the hut firing their guns, and kept up the fire as they got through a bush fence that led to the creek. They positioned themselves behind a large tree. Gilbert fired his revolving rifle at Hales and Bright, but it misfired. Meanwhile, King and Hall took up positions. Dunn and Gilbert started firing their revolvers at Hall and King and ran down to the creek.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. It is a frequently visited historical site. History and origin A photo of the cemetery in the late 1800s The cemetery traces its origins to a Catholic mission, started in 1835 by a Catholic missionary named Frederic Baraga. Fr. Baraga came to La Pointe from Europe in the summer of 1835, to evangelize the Native American population. The mission was dedicated on August 9, 1835, under the name St. Joseph's Chapel. It was made of logs, and was located about 100 feet south of the current graveyard. The graveyard was consecrated the following year as the official burial place of the Catholic mission. However, earlier burials probably already existed at this location, as later archaeological studies have revealed several earlier ancient graves in the vicinity. There are several notable historical people buried in the cemetery. Lake Superior Chippewa Chief Kechewaishke, also known as Great Buffalo, is perhaps the most recognizable. Also buried in the cemetery is Madeline Cadotte, whom Madeline Island is named after. Name The name Indian Cemetery is a misnomer. Although many Native American people are buried in the cemetery, it is actually also the burial place for many of the island's original white settlers. There is much ethnic diversity among those laid to rest at the cemetery, which includes all those who were associated with the Catholic mission. In reality, the more correct name for the cemetery is St. Joseph Mission Cemetery, which it used to be called, up until the middle of the twentieth century. In the 1950s, Madeline Island tourist literature described the cemetery as \\"the old Indian burial grounds\\", in an attempt to market the place as a historical tourist site. And while not actually being an only- Native American cemetery, the name \\"Indian Cemetery\\" stuck, despite being somewhat misleading. Although not strictly a Native American cemetery, Native spirituality is given a nod, in certain aspects of the cemetery. In honoring an Ojibwe custom, many graves of Ojibwe people are covered with a \\"Spirit House\\". Such a grave covering is designed to protect the deceased buried there. Relatives would place food and other items inside the small shelter, to aid the soul of the dead on their journey to the afterlife. The cemetery today Current photo By the 1950s, shoreline erosion was threatening the piece of lakeside land that the cemetery sits on. To help stabilize the historic site, a plan was set in motion by a local congressman to have a breakwater built. Thus, at the time, the Roman Catholic Church transferred ownership of the cemetery to the federal government, so federal funds could be spent on preserving the historically important site. For many decades, the cemetery has been a major attraction for summer visitors interested in learning about the island's history. But the site hasn't been without controversy. In the 1960s, many visitors and island residents were concerned about what many thought was neglect for the cemetery's condition. Being overgrown with grass and brush, and suffering from litter dropped by some tourists, the cemetery was described by some as being in deplorable condition. Some disappointed visitors went so far as to contact the Wisconsin Historical Society and insist that they seek some solution to help improve the historical site. In 1977, the cemetery became listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Maintenance and landscaping has vastly improved in recent decades. Due to past problems with vandalism, visitors are no longer granted admission inside of the cemetery gates. While visitors are still welcome and encouraged to see the site, visitors are asked to observe the cemetery from outside the metal gate, where there is a historical marker displaying the history of the site. The only exception to this rule is that of family descendants who may need access to a relative's plot. The history and significance of the cemetery is discussed in the book, ‚ÄúBadger Boneyards‚Äù, by author Dennis McCann, on pages 135-139. () There is a regional folklore that exists, regarding paranormal activity that occurs at the cemetery. Anecdotes about the paranormal occurrences might not be substantiated scientifically, but have surfaced in the form of popular tales told about the cemetery. The cemetery continues to be a sacred site for descendants and relatives of those interred within. History of other Native American burials on Madeline Island Madeline Island has been inhabited for centuries by Native Americans. And as one might expect, there are other places on the island that have been used as burial grounds, throughout the centuries. While lacking any kind of grave markers, unknown by the general public, and totally lacking any type of marker to identify the locations, many ancient burial grounds on Madeline Island are mostly known by a few in the local Native community.

It is situated just inland from the eastern coast of the South Island. The town is reached via a short detour west when travelling on State Highway One, the main North/South road. Waimate is 45.7 km south of Timaru, Canterbury's second city, 20 km north of the Waitaki River, which forms the border between Canterbury and the Otago province to the south and 47.5 km north of Oamaru, the main town of the Waitaki District. The population of the Waimate District was recorded in the 2006 census as 7,206 people. The district's area of 3,582.19 square kilometres forms the southern section of the agriculturally rich Canterbury Plains. Waimate is well known for its population of Bennett's wallabies. These marsupials were introduced from Australia and now live wild in the countryside surrounding the town. It is also recognised for the White Horse Monument which is a silhouette of a white horse that can be seen on the hills behind the town. It commemorates the Clydesdale horses that helped breaking in the land in earlier days. Visitors to the monument's lookout are rewarded with panoramic views of the town and the district's green plains out towards the Pacific Ocean.  History  From 1877 until 1966, Waimate was served by the Waimate Branch, a branch line railway that connected with the Main South Line some seven kilometres east in Studholme. For roughly seventy years ending in 1953, the line ran beyond Waimate to Waihao Downs. When the branch line was closed on 31 March 1966, Waimate became the first major town in New Zealand to lose its railway connection.  Geography  The Waimate District is bounded by the Waitaki River in the south, the Pareora River in the north and the Hakataramea Valley to the west. The district is a very productive agricultural area with a mix of pastoral, cropping, dairy farming, fruit and vegetable growing. The Waihao River, which starts in the Hunter Hills catchment area runs eastwards on the southern side of the Waimate township joining with the Waimate Creek. They both eventually end up discharging very close to the sea into the Wainono Dead Arm, which then flows into the Wainono Lagoon near Studholme.  Nearby communities  *Glenavy *Hook *Hunter *Ikawai *Makikihi *Morven *Otaio *Saint Andrews *Studholme *Waihao Downs *Waihaorunga *Waituna Panorama of the view from the White Horse overlooking Waimate township.  Economy  Like much of rural New Zealand, Waimate suffered from an economic downturn in the 1980s, with the closure of the dairy factory and a number of sawmills. For the last decade of the 20th century the biggest employers in the district were two furniture manufacturers, a vegetable processing plant and a factory making French fries and other potato products at Makikihi. All but the latter closed within the first few years of the 21st century. However, a newly developed large scale sawmill and the development of a large milk powder factory, coupled with the wealth of dairy farms and the nationwide real estate bubble of 2003-2007, saw a renewed confidence in Waimate.

Early modern discourses  German Romanticism  Johann Herder called attention to national cultures. The German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724‚Äì1804) has formulated an individualist definition of \\"enlightenment\\" similar to the concept of bildung: \\"Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity.\\"Immanuel Kant 1784 \\"Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment?\\" (German: \\"Beantwortung der Frage: Was ist Aufkl√§rung?\\") Berlinische Monatsschrift, December (Berlin Monthly) He argued that this immaturity comes not from a lack of understanding, but from a lack of courage to think independently. Against this intellectual cowardice, Kant urged: Sapere aude, \\"Dare to be wise!\\" In reaction to Kant, German scholars such as Johann Gottfried Herder (1744‚Äì1803) argued that human creativity, which necessarily takes unpredictable and highly diverse forms, is as important as human rationality. Moreover, Herder proposed a collective form of bildung: \\"For Herder, Bildung was the totality of experiences that provide a coherent identity, and sense of common destiny, to a people.\\"Michael Eldridge, \\"The German Bildung Tradition\\" UNC Charlotte Adolf Bastian developed a universal model of culture. In 1795, the great linguist and philosopher Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767‚Äì1835) called for an anthropology that would synthesize Kant's and Herder's interests. During the Romantic era, scholars in Germany, especially those concerned with nationalist movements‚Äîsuch as the nationalist struggle to create a \\"Germany\\" out of diverse principalities, and the nationalist struggles by ethnic minorities against the Austro-Hungarian Empire‚Äîdeveloped a more inclusive notion of culture as \\"worldview\\"(Weltanschauung). According to this school of thought, each ethnic group has a distinct worldview that is incommensurable with the worldviews of other groups. Although more inclusive than earlier views, this approach to culture still allowed for distinctions between \\"civilized\\" and \\"primitive\\" or \\"tribal\\" cultures. In 1860, Adolf Bastian (1826‚Äì1905) argued for \\"the psychic unity of mankind\\". He proposed that a scientific comparison of all human societies would reveal that distinct worldviews consisted of the same basic elements. According to Bastian, all human societies share a set of \\"elementary ideas\\" (Elementargedanken); different cultures, or different \\"folk ideas\\" (V√∂lkergedanken), are local modifications of the elementary ideas.\\"Adolf Bastian\\", Today in Science History; \\"Adolf Bastian\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica This view paved the way for the modern understanding of culture. Franz Boas (1858‚Äì1942) was trained in this tradition, and he brought it with him when he left Germany for the United States.  English Romanticism  British poet and critic Matthew Arnold viewed \\"culture\\" as the cultivation of the humanist ideal. In the 19th century, humanists such as English poet and essayist Matthew Arnold (1822‚Äì1888) used the word \\"culture\\" to refer to an ideal of individual human refinement, of \\"the best that has been thought and said in the world.\\"Arnold, Matthew. 1869. Culture and Anarchy. This concept of culture is comparable to the German concept of bildung: \\"...culture being a pursuit of our total perfection by means of getting to know, on all the matters which most concern us, the best which has been thought and said in the world.\\" In practice, culture referred to an √©lite ideal and was associated with such activities as art, classical music, and haute cuisine.Williams (1983), p.90. Cited in Shuker, Roy (1994). Understanding Popular Music, p.5. . argues that contemporary definitions of culture fall into three possibilities or mixture of the following three: * \\"a general process of intellectual, spiritual, and aesthetic development\\" * \\"a particular way of life, whether of a people, period, or a group\\" * \\"the works and practices of intellectual and especially artistic activity\\". As these forms were associated with urban life, \\"culture\\" was identified with \\"civilization\\" (from lat. civitas, city). Another facet of the Romantic movement was an interest in folklore, which led to identifying a \\"culture\\" among non-elites. This distinction is often characterized as that between high culture, namely that of the ruling social group, and low culture. In other words, the idea of \\"culture\\" that developed in Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries reflected inequalities within European societies.Bakhtin 1981, p.4 British anthropologist Edward Tylor was one of the first English-speaking scholars to use the term culture in an inclusive and universal sense. Matthew Arnold contrasted \\"culture\\" with anarchy; other Europeans, following philosophers Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, contrasted \\"culture\\" with \\"the state of nature\\". According to Hobbes and Rousseau, the Native Americans who were being conquered by Europeans from the 16th centuries on were living in a state of nature; this opposition was expressed through the contrast between \\"civilized\\" and \\"uncivilized.\\" According to this way of thinking, one could classify some countries and nations as more civilized than others and some people as more cultured than others. This contrast led to Herbert Spencer's theory of Social Darwinism and Lewis Henry Morgan's theory of cultural evolution. Just as some critics have argued that the distinction between high and low cultures is really an expression of the conflict between European elites and non-elites, some critics have argued that the distinction between civilized and uncivilized people is really an expression of the conflict between European colonial powers and their colonial subjects. Other 19th-century critics, following Rousseau have accepted this differentiation between higher and lower culture, but have seen the refinement and sophistication of high culture as corrupting and unnatural developments that obscure and distort people's essential nature. These critics considered folk music (as produced by \\"the folk\\", i.e., rural, illiterate, peasants) to honestly express a natural way of life, while classical music seemed superficial and decadent. Equally, this view often portrayed indigenous peoples as \\"noble savages\\" living authentic and unblemished lives, uncomplicated and uncorrupted by the highly stratified capitalist systems of the West. In 1870 the anthropologist Edward Tylor (1832‚Äì1917) applied these ideas of higher versus lower culture to propose a theory of the evolution of religion. According to this theory, religion evolves from more polytheistic to more monotheistic forms.McClenon, pp.528-529 In the process, he redefined culture as a diverse set of activities characteristic of all human societies. This view paved the way for the modern understanding of culture.

The settlement has a long history, having been mentioned for the first time in 1303 as a Catholic parish. The town was prior to the Kosovo War (1998‚Äì99) inhabited by a majority of Croats, known by their demonym as Janjevci, who since have left massively for Croatia. Geography Janjevo is described as a village or small town, located in Lipljan municipality, by Gornja Gu≈°terica and Teƒçe. History Middle Ages Forts and settlements in late antiquity Kosovo Janjevo was first mentioned in 1303. Although only a Catholic parish is mentioned, and no information on mining activity, it is assumed that the Catholic community in fact drew from miners, gathered in such numbers to constitute a parish. Whether these Catholics were Ragusans or Saxons is unknown; with the opening of mines in medieval Serbia, Saxons (Sasi) are mentioned as mining specialists; although they are not mentioned as inhabiting Janjevo, they most likely did, as the settlement ≈†a≈°kovac located less than 1 km from Janjevo points to. In 1346, the Pope sent a letter to Stefan Du≈°an regarding churches that belonged to the Diocese of Kotor, in which Janjevo is mentioned. In the first half of the 15th century, when the area was still part of a Serbian state, a Ragusan colony appeared in Janjevo. At this time, Janjevo, along with Novo Brdo and Trepƒça, were the most important mines in Serbia. Out of 15 manholes only two produced qualitative ore. From 1455 a coin mint was active in Janjevo. The local Catholic church, dedicated to St. Nicholas, was built in the 15th century. In a tablet dating to 1425, Stephanus Marci, a priest of the Janjevo parish, is mentioned. In 1441, priest Andreas was the head of the Janjevo parish, based in that church. The population of this Catholic parish of Janjevo were mainly members of a Ragusan colony (to which Andreas also belonged). Janjevo most likely fell to the Ottoman Empire after the Ottoman conquest of Novo Brdo (1455). Ottoman period In 1530‚Äì31 there were six Christian and one Muslim neighbourhoods (mahala) in Janjevo. In 1569‚Äì70 it became an imperial estate with revenue (hass). There were at that time seven neighbourhoods. Marino Bizzi (1570‚Äì1624), the Archbishop of Bar, listed 120 Latin (Catholic), 200 schismatic (Orthodox), and 180 Turkish (Muslim) homes, during his journey in Ottoman Serbia in 1610.Relatione della visita fatta da me, Marino Bizzi, Arcivescovo d'Antivari, nelle parti della Turchia, Antivari, Albania et Servia alla santit√† di nostro Signore papa Paolo V.

Contemporary In 1922, Henry Baerlein noted that the Austrians had for thirty years tried to albanianize the Janjevo population. In 1997, the Croatian government began resettling declared Croats from the village to Kistanje in Croatia. During the Kosovo War (1998‚Äì99), the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) attacked the village. As of 2011, only 270 out of the pre-war 1500 Croats remain in the village. Population The population of Janjevci has decreased since the 1970s. Since 1971, the Janjevci have immigrated from Janjevo to Zagreb and Kistanje, causing a decline in the population of the Janjevci. There is a Catholic church (St. Nikola) located in the town about 100 meters from the main mosque. Anthropology In the Middle Ages, Ragusans and likely Saxons (Sasi) inhabited the village. The inhabitants of Janjevo have in the past called themselves and been called \\"Latins\\" (). Anthropologist A. Uro≈°eviƒá noted during field study, published in 1935, that many Janjevans lacked national consciousness. They spoke a Kosovan dialect, as the Serbs, but called it Janjevan. As the Serbs, they had family feast days (slava). In 1991, the most numerous families were the Paliƒá (Matiƒá and Ruciƒá), Glasnoviƒá (Tomkiƒá and Topaloviƒá), ƒÜibariƒá, Beri≈°iƒá (Anciƒá, Mazarekiƒá and Golomejiƒá), Macukiƒá, and Cirimotiƒá.

For convenience both in speech and in the written word the term is often shortened to its acronym LGAP (and pronounced 'ell-gap'). The establishment of an LGAP typically follows the carrying out of a RIGS audit for the area concerned. RIGS are those localities within an area which have been determined to be 'regionally significant geodiversity sites' (this term is tending to replace the earlier, and somewhat clumsy, 'regionally significant geological and geomorphological sites'. The plans are analogous to the Local Biodiversity Action Plans (or 'LBAPs') which have been created in respect of the fauna, flora and habitats of areas of England and Wales. The production of such plans is promoted and assisted by the statutory nature conservation bodies for England, Scotland and Wales, respectively Natural England, Scottish Natural Heritage and the Natural Resources Wales. A similar approach is being taken by certain companies to prepare plans for their landholdings. Examples By way of example, an LGAP was prepared for the county of Lancashire by the GeoLancashire RIGS group and another is in preparation for the Clwydian Hills AONB by a partnership involving NEWRIGS (North East Wales Regionally Important Geodiversity Sites group)http://www.clwydianrangeaonb.org.uk/files/296566208-LGAP_Report_ENGLISH.pdf whilst an LGAP for Edinburgh incorporates an LGAP.

In November 1886, she sank due to bad weather in Lake Superior, off Long Island in Chequamegon Bay. The site of the wreck was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. History Lucerne was launched on April 23, 1873. She was nearly long and reportedly cost $55,000 to build. On November 15, 1886, Lucerne was loaded with 1,200 tons of iron ore at her home port, Ashland, Wisconsin. The load was consigned to Little, Oglebay and Company of Cleveland, Ohio. After the delivery, the captain and crew began a voyage back to Ashland. With new canvas sails and a light wind blowing, all the signs pointed to a speedy voyage home. However, a November snowstorm on the lake began developing that night. On November 17 or 18, 1886, Lucerne succumbed to the violent storm, and sank off Long Island. At the height of the storm, the captain of the ship Fred Kelly had been sighted Lucerne, but Fred Kelly unfortunately could not offer any help to the distressed ship under the circumstances. Nobody witnessed Lucerne's final minutes, and none of the crew survived. William Mack, part owner of Lucerne, became worried when the ship never arrived back Ashland. He telegraphed Bayfield, Wisconsin, and asked for a search vessel to be sent. The boat S. B. Barker was dispatched for the purpose, but did not have to go far to find the wreckage of Lucerne. The S. B. Barker‚Ä≤s crew discovered three masts sticking out of the water. Upon closer inspection, they saw three of the ship's crew members there, frozen solid in three inches (76 mm) of ice.

The first passengers to arrive via railway to Pugwash was a group of Cumberland County school teachers, October 28, 1890. It is built of brick and is described as \\"restrained gothic style, two stories, cross gable roof with 6 hip gable dormers and decorative faces\\". The railway station was listed on September 11, 1996 as a Municipally Registered Property under the Heritage Property Act, and as a Provincially Registered Property under the same statute in 2009. The Pugwash railway station is one of only two stations designed by Fleming still standing in Nova Scotia. The station is also famous for its part in the Thinkers Conference. Pugwash native Cyrus Eaton used the station to transport and house those who attended conference.  Fires of 1926 and 1929  The devastating fires of 1926 and 1929 destroyed the pugwash hotels, so luxury railcars were parked at the station and used as accommodations.

Some musicians only use the term guajeo for ostinato patterns played specifically by a tres, piano, an instrument of the violin family, or saxophones. Piano guajeos are one of the most recognizable elements of modern- day salsa. Piano guajeos are also known as montunos in North America, or tumbaos in the contemporary Cuban dance music timba. Playing guajeos on guitar and tres in Cuban son music (1925). __TOC__ History The guajeo shares rhythmic, melodic and harmonic similarities with the short ostinato figures played on marimbas, lamellophones, and string instruments in sub-Saharan Africa. The guajeo is a seamless blend of African and European musical sensibilities, and was first played as accompaniment on the tres in the Afro-Cuban son and related music. The tres is a Cuban guitar- like instrument, consisting of three sets of double strings. Tres cubano Chang√º√≠ The guajeo emerged in Cuba during the 19th century, in the genres known as chang√º√≠ and son.Lapidus, Ben (2008). Origins of Cuban Music and Dance; Chang√º√≠ p. 16-18.

Clave Clave motif 3-2 clave Most guajeos have a binary structure, with a specific alignment to the guide pattern known as clave. As Kevin Moore explains: \\"There are two common ways that the three-side is expressed in Cuban popular music. The first to come into regular use, which David Pe√±alosa calls 'clave motif,' is based on the decorated version of the three-side of the clave rhythm.\\"Moore 2011 p. 32. Understanding Clave and Clave Changes. Santa Cruz, CA: Moore Music/Timba.com. The following guajeo example is based on a clave motif. The three-side (first measure) consists of the tresillo variant known as cinquillo. Because the chord progression begins on the three-side, this guajeo is said to be in a three-two clave sequence. 3-2 Piano guajeo: clave motif () 2-3 clave A chord progression can begin on either side of clave. \\"One\\" can therefore be on either the three- side, or the two-side, because the harmonic progression, rather than the rhythmic progression is the primary referent.Pe√±alosa 2010 p. 136. The Clave Matrix; Afro-Cuban Rhythm: Its Principles and African Origins. Redway, CA: Bembe Inc. . When a chord progression begins on the two-side of clave, the music is said to be in two-three clave. The following guajeo is based on the clave motif in a two-three sequence. The cinquillo rhythm is now in the second measure. 2-3 piano guajeo: clave motif () Offbeat/onbeat motif 3-2 clave Moore: \\"By the 1940s [there was] a trend toward the use of what Pe√±alosa calls the 'offbeat/onbeat motif.' Today, the offbeat/onbeat motif method is much more common.\\"Moore 2011 p. 32. Understanding Clave. Santa Cruz, CA: Moore Music/Timba.com. . With this type of guajeo motif, the three-side of clave is expressed with all offbeats. The following I IV V IV progression is in a three-two clave sequence. It begins with an offbeat pick-up on the pulse immediately before beat 1. With some guajeos, offbeats at the end of the two- side, or onbeats at the end of the three-side serve as pick-ups leading into the next measure (when clave is written in two measures). 3-2 guajeo: offbeat/onbeat motif (). 2-3 clave This guajeo is in two-three clave because it begins on the downbeat, emphasizing the onbeat quality of the two- side. The figure has the same exact harmonic sequence as the previous example, but rhythmically, the attack-point sequence of the two measures is reversed. Most salsa music is in two-three clave, and most salsa piano guajeos are based on the two-three onbeat/offbeat motif. 2-3 guajeo: onbeat/offbeat motif (). Ponchando Ponchando is a term for a type of non-arpeggiated guajeo using block chords. The sequence of attack-points is emphasized, rather than a sequence of different pitches. As a form of accompaniment it can be played in a strictly repetitive fashion or as a varied motif akin to jazz comping.Pe√±alosa, David 2010. The Clave Matrix; Afro-Cuban Rhythm: Its Principles and African Origins p. 256. Redway, CA: Bembe Inc. . Clave is written in two measures. 2-3 clave (top) with ponchando figure (bottom). This ponchando pattern is familiar to many as Santana's \\"Oye Como Va\\". Moore states: \\"Hip fans will often flaunt their knowledge by pointing out that the song was originally recorded by Tito Puente in 1963, and before that by Arca√±o y sus Maravillas as \\"Chanchullo\\" in 1957, but it goes all the way back to Cachao's \\"Rareza de Melit√≥n\\" in 1942.Moore, Kevin (2009: 16). Beyond Salsa Piano; The Cuban Timba Piano Revolution v.2 Early Cuban Piano Tumbao (1940‚Äì59). Santa Cruz, CA: Moore Music/Timba.com. Ponchando figure originally used in \\"Rareza de Melit√≥n\\" (1942) by Arcano y Sus Maravillas (). Mo√±as A mo√±a is a horn guajeo, which can be written or improvised. A section of layered, contrapuntal horn guajeos is also referred to sometimes as a mo√±a. Mo√±as differ from typical rhythm section guajeos in that they often will rest for a beat or two within their cycle. Those beats within a measure not sounded by the mo√±a are often \\"filled\\" by a chorus, or counter mo√±a. What's known as the Cuban t√≠pico style of soloing on trombone draws upon the technique of stringing together mo√±a variations. The following example shows five different variants of a 2‚Äì3 trombone mo√±a improvised by Jos√© Rodr√≠gues on \\"Bilongo\\" (c. 1969), performed by Eddie Palmieri. The examples are written in cut-time (2/2); there are two main beats per measure. Mo√±a 1 sounds every stroke of 2‚Äì3 clave except the first stroke of the three-side. Melodic variety is created by transposing the module in accordance to the harmonic sequence, as Rick Davies observes in his detailed analysis of the first mo√±a: > The mo√±a consists of a two-measure module and its repetition, which is > altered to reflect the montuno chord progression. The module begins with > four ascending eighth-notes starting on the second [quarter-note of the > measure]. This configuration emphasizes the ... two-side of the clave. In > both of the modules, these four notes move from G3 to Eb4. Although the > first, third, and fourth notes (G3, C4, and Eb4) are identical in both > modules, the second note reflects the change in harmony. In the first > module, this note is the Bb3 third of the tonic harmony; in the module > repetition, the A3 is the fifth of the dominant. Of the final five notes in > the module, the first four are [offbeats]; the final D4 is on the [last > quarter-note] in the second measure of the module. Along with the final D4, > the initial D4 on the [last offbeat] in the first measure of the module and > the Eb4 on the [offbeat] immediately preceding the final note of the module > are identical in both modules. The [offbeats] in the second-module measure > reflect the harmonic changes. The first version of the module is over the > dominant chord and contains the pitches A3 (the fifth) and C4 (the seventh). > A Bb3 is sounded twice on the two [offbeats] in the module's repetition and > represents the third G minor tonic chord.Davies, Rick (2003: 149). Trompeta; > Chappott√≠n, Chocolate, and the Afro-Cuban Trumpet Style. . Piano Son montuno When the piano was added to the son conjunto, the harmonic possibilities were widened, facilitating the adaptation of jazz chords into guajeos in the 1940s. As Rebeca Maule√≥n points out though, the main \\"role of the pianist in Afro-Cuban music is a more rhythmic one.\\"Maule√≥n, Rebeca (1993) Salsa Guidebook for Piano and Ensemble. p. 117. Petaluma, California: Sher Music. . The piano guajeos of Arsenio Rodr√≠guez's group were innovative for their binary rhythmic structure, reflecting clave. The piano guajeo for \\"Dame un cachito pa' huele\\" (1946) completely departs from both the generic son guajeo and the song's melody. The pattern marks the clave by accenting the backbeat on the two-side. Moore observes: \\"Like so many aspects of Arsenio's music, this miniature composition is decades ahead of its time. It would be forty years before groups began to consistently apply this much creative variation at the guajeo level of the arranging process\\" (2009: 41).Moore 2009. p. 41. Voicings The typical voicings for piano guajeos is octaves. Sonny Bravo explains: > \\"You can play it in octaves‚Äîsingle notes in both hands. Or you could double > it up. When you're backing a singer, you don't want to get too intense. But > when the horns come in on the mambo, you've got to cut through a little > more.

Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press. 2-3 piano guajeo in octaves. Mambo In the late 1940s D√°maso P√©rez Prado popularized the mambo, a genre which had been by that time, evolving for a decade. P√©rez Prado moved to Mexico City in 1948 and started his own band, where he composed and recorded his most famous mambos.Le√≥n, Javier F. \\"Mambo.\\" Encyclopedia of Latino Popular Culture. Ed. Cordelia Ch√°vez Candelaria, Arturo J. Aldama, Peter J. Garc√≠a, Alma √Ålvarez-Smith. 2 vols. Connecticut: Praeger, 2004: 510 While in Mexico, P√©rez Prado earned the title El Rey del Mambo ('King of the Mambo'), and he appeared in several Mexican films. P√©rez Prado's recordings were meant for the Latin American and U.S. Latino markets, but some of his most celebrated mambos, such as \\"Mambo No. 5\\" quickly \\"crossed-over\\" in the United States.Le√≥n, Javier F. \\"Mambo.\\" Encyclopedia of Latino Popular Culture. Ed. Cordelia Ch√°vez Candelaria, Arturo J. Aldama, Peter J. Garc√≠a, Alma √Ålvarez-Smith. 2 vols. Connecticut: Praeger, 2004: 510. A \\"mambo craze\\" swept North America in the 1950s. Descarga The right hand of the \\"Tanga\\" piano guajeo is another example of a ponchando pattern. \\"Tanga\\" was initially a descarga (Cuban jam session) with jazz solos superimposed, spontaneously composed by Mario Bauz√° at a rehearsal (May 29, 1943). Descargas were the \\"laboratories\\" where instrumentalists honed their skill of soloing in-clave. \\"Tanga\\" was, over time, arranged with more complexity, and is generally considered the first original Latin jazz, or more correctly Afro-Cuban jazz tune. The following example is in the style of a 1949 recording by Machito, with Ren√© Hern√°ndez on piano.Moore, Kevin (2009).

Jazz Guajeo motifs Guajeos or guajeo fragments are commonly used motifs in Latin jazz melodies. For example, the A section of \\"Sabor\\" is a 2‚Äì3 onbeat/offbeat guajeo, minus some notes. A section of \\"Sabor\\" by Jo√£o Donato, as arranged by Mark Levine, and performed by Cal Tjader. Jazz voicings Just as guajeo patterns entered jazz, jazz harmonies were in turn, adopted into the piano guajeos of dance music. The exchange between Cuban popular music styles and jazz became a two-way street. > From jazz came a harmonic vocabulary based on extended harmonies of altered > and unaltered ninths, elevenths and thirteenths, as well as quartal > harmony‚Äîchords built on fourths.

Chachach√° The chachach√° can be thought of as a rare \\"de-Africanizing\\" step in Cuban popular music's trajectory in the mid-20th century because it involves unison singing, instead of call-and-response. > Although the term, dance step, and popular mania of chachach√° took hold in > 1951, its key musical elements were already in place in Arca√±o's group of > 1948, including Enrique Jorr√≠n, the violinist‚Äêcomposer who would later be > credited as the \\"inventor\\" of the genre.

Generic chachach√° piano guajeo (c. late 1940s) Mozambique Cuban- style Pello el Afrok√°n's mozambique was the first post‚Äêrevolution Cuban popular dance genre (1963). It was the first Cuban popular music to systematically use rumba clave as its guide pattern. Although the rhythm shares many characteristics with Sub-Saharan African music traditions, it does not have anything to do with music from the African nation of Mozambique. The Cuban mozambique features conga drums, bombos (bass drums), cowbells, and trombones. See: \\"Mozambique Lesson in Cuba, 1985\\" (Pello el Afrokan), and \\"Mozambique Rhythm from Cuba\\" (Kim Atkinson). Pello's mozambique \\"Mar√≠a Caracoles\\" was recorded by Carlos Santana. In terms of density and the way it marks the clave, the \\"Mar√≠a Caracoles\\" guajeo is closer in style to a bass tumbao than to a typical piano guajeo.Moore, Kevin (2010: 14). Beyond Salsa Piano; The Cuban Timba Piano Revolution v.3 Early Cuban Piano Tumbao (1960‚Äì79). Santa Cruz, CA: Moore Music/Timba.com. New York-style In New York City during the 1960s Eddie Palmieri created a rhythm called mozambique that was inspired by Pello's invention of the same name.Mozambique Palmieri, Eddie. Tico CD 1126 (1965). While both rhythms are based on conga de comparsa, they are in fact, two separate, distinct rhythms that do not share any common parts. [See: \\"The History of the New York-Style Mozambique\\" (Andy Gonz√°lez interviews Manny Oquendo).] Even the clave patterns are different; Pello's rhythm uses rumba clave, while the Palmieri version uses son clave. Pello's mozambiques are, for the most part, in major keys. Palmieri's mozambiques are mostly in minor keys.Sanabria, Bobby \\"Re: mozambique.\\" Latinjazz Yahoo Group. 17 Sept. 2002. However, both groups primarily use chord progressions in a 2-3 clave sequence, and a trombone horn section. The following piano guajeo is in the New York mozambique style. NY-style 2-3 mozambique piano guajeo by Rebeca Maule√≥n. Maule√≥n makes the point that since the Cuban mozambique originally began in what was essentially a percussion ensemble with trombones, there is no set piano part for the rhythm.Maule√≥n (1993: 214) It is worth noting that while Pello created specific percussion parts for his mozambique, the only specific percussion part in the New York style is the bell pattern.

Songo Juan Formel's initial songo experiments in Los Van Van used piano guajeos with an on-beat feel, as a way of simulating rock. On \\"Con el bate de aluminio\\" (1979), the right hand plays steady onbeats, sounding a rock‚Äêinfluenced imi ‚Äì bVII ‚Äì bVI chord progression.Moore Kevin (2011: 33).

Timba The Cuban jazz pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba developed a technique of pattern and harmonic displacement in the 1980s, which was adopted into timba guajeos in the 1990s. The following guajeo for Issac Delgado's \\"La tem√°tica\\" (1997) demonstrates some of the innovations of timba piano. A series of repeated octaves invoke a characteristic metric ambiguity. The following guajeo (or piano tumbao), created by Iv√°n \\"Mel√≥n\\" Lewis is from \\"No me mires a los ojos\\" (Issac Delgado 1995). It is a prime example of one of the most critical timba piano innovations‚Äîthe idea that the piano tumbao be a ‚Äúhook‚Äù by which the song can be identified and that contributes greatly to the song‚Äôs popularity. There are three places where the left hand adds an extra note between two right hand notes, a technique never used before in timba, which has become a major timba piano innovation. Mel√≥n was the first to use it as a central part of his style.Moore, Kevin (2010: 22) Beyond Salsa Piano v. 9 Iv√°n ‚ÄúMel√≥n‚Äù Lewis, pt. 6. . Listen: \\"No me Mires a los ojos\\" by Issac Delgado. Lewis's piano guajeo on Delgado's \\"La tem√°tica\\" incorporates the technique of pattern displacement. A series of repeated octaves invoke a characteristic metric ambiguity (Moore 2010: pt. 4. 96-108). Layered guajeos Diablo Arsenio Rodr√≠guez introduced the idea of layered guajeos‚Äîan interlocking structure consisting of multiple contrapuntal parts. The concept, which he began developing in his conjunto in 1934, reached full maturity in 1938.Max Salazar 1992. \\"Who Invented the Mambo?\\" part 2. Latin Beat Magazine. v. 2 n. 9: 8. p. 11. This aspect of the son's modernization can be thought of as a matter of \\"re-Africanizing\\" the music. Helio Orovio recalls: \\"Arsenio once said his trumpets played figurations the 'Oriente' tres-guitarists played during the improvisational part of el son\\" (1992: 11).Helio Orovio quoted by Max Salazar 1992. \\"Who Invented the Mambo?\\" part 2. Latin Beat Magazine. v. 2 n. 9: 8. p. 11. The \\"Oriente\\" is the name given to the eastern end of Cuba, where the son was born. It is common practice for treseros to play a series of guajeo variations during their solos. Perhaps it was only natural then that it was Rodr√≠guez the tres master, who conceived of the idea of layering these variations on top of each other. The following example is from the \\"diablo\\" section of Rodr√≠guez's son montuno \\"Kile, Kike y Chocolate\\" (1950).Garc√≠a, David (2006: 52). Arsenio Rodr√≠guez and the transnational flows of Latin popular music. Philadelphia. The excerpt consists of four interlocking guajeos: piano (bottom line), tres (second line), 2nd and 3rd trumpets (third line), and 1st trumpet (fourth line). 2-3 Clave is shown for reference (top line). Notice that the piano plays a single celled (single measure) guajeo, while the other guajeos are two-celled. It is common practice to combine single and double-celled guajeos in Afro-Cuban music. > During the 1940s, the conjunto instrumentation was in full swing, as were > the groups who incorporated the jazz band (or big band) instrumentation in > the ensemble, guajeos (vamp-like lines) could be divided among each > instrument section, such as saxes and brass; this became even more > subdivided, featuring three or more independent riffs for smaller sections > within the ensemble.

Chachach√° Orquesta Arag√≥n creatively juxtaposed a counter violin guajeo over the piano on \\"No me molesto\\" (1955). Here is another example of guajeo counterpoint (1957). The violins echo the E ‚Äì F ‚Äì F# piano figure. The bass plays a chachach√° figure that would be used extensively in timba during the 1990s.Moore (2009: 40). Mo√±as One very effective technique used in mambos and descargas is the use of layered, varying mo√±as. The trumpet and trombone mo√±as shown below (\\"Bilongo\\") can be repeated verbatim, or altered. Improvisation is within a framework of repetition and the melodic contour of the mo√±as. In this way, multiple instrumentalists can improvise simultaneously while reinforcing the rhythmic/melodic momentum of the rhythm section.Davies, Rick (2003: 149). Trompeta; Chappott√≠n, Chocolate, and the Afro-Cuban Trumpet Style. . 2-3 trumpet and trombone mo√±as, \\"Bilongo\\" (c. 1969) Top: trumpet; bottom: trombone. The next mo√±a layers are from the descarga \\"Guatacando\\" (1968). The trumpet figure is one clave in length, while the trombone figure is two claves. This is a classic example of how mo√±as are layered. The trombone Mo√±a consists of two parts, a call-and-response structure. The trumpet mo√±a begins on the last note of first half of the trombone mo√±a. The second half of the trombone mo√±a begins on the pulse (subdivision) immediately following the last note of the trumpet mo√±a. 2-3 trumpet and trombone mo√±as, \\"Guatacando\\" (1968). 1. trumpets; 2. trombones. Songo \\"Fallaste al sacar\\" (1982) by Los Van Van is an example of creative guajeo counterpoint. Moore states: \\"Pupy's arrangement pushes the envelope ... by expanding the violin part from the usual sparse rhythmic loop to a long and constantly varying melody, pitted against an almost equally inventive piano [guajeo]. The violin part is active and creative enough to stand alone as a mambo section, but it is used as the underpinning for an equally complex and interesting coro. The violin part could also be nicely adapted for use in a 1990s‚Äêstyle timba piano [guajeo].\\"Moore (2011: 61). Beyond Sala Piano: The Cuban Timba Revolution v. 10 The Music of Los Van Van Part 1.

R&B;, funk, and rock New Orleans has a long history of absorbing Afro-Cuban musical influences, going back at least to the mid-19th century.

Professor Longhair In the 1940s New Orleans pianist \\"Professor Longhair\\" (Henry Roeland Byrd) was playing with Caribbean musicians, listening a lot to Perez Prado's mambo records, and absorbing and experimenting with it all.Palmer, Robert (1979: 14). A Tale of Two Cities: Memphis Rock and New Orleans Roll. Brooklyn. He was especially enamored with Cuban music. Michael Campbell states: \\"Rhythm and blues influenced by Afro-Cuban music first surfaced in New Orleans. Professor Longhair's influence was ... far reaching.Campbell, Michael, and James Brody (2007: 83). Rock and Roll: An Introduction. Schirmer. Longhair's style was known locally as rumba-boogie.Stewart, Alexander (2000: 298). \\"Funky Drummer: New Orleans, James Brown and the Rhythmic Transformation of American Popular Music.\\" Popular Music, v. 19, n. 3.

In his composition \\"Misery,\\" Longhair plays a habanera-like figure in his left hand.

One of Longhair's great contributions was the adaptation of two-celled, clave-based patterns in New Orleans blues. Campbell: \\"In several of his early recordings, Professor Longhair blended Afro-Cuban rhythms with rhythm and blues. The most explicit is \\"Longhair's Blues Rhumba,\\" where he overlays a straightforward blues with a clave rhythm. According to Dr. John (Malcolm John \\"Mac\\" Rebennack, Jr.), the Professor \\"put funk into music ... Longhair's thing had a direct bearing I'd say on a large portion of the funk music that evolved in New Orleans.\\"Dr. John quoted by Stewart (2000: 297). The guajeo-like piano part for the Professor Longhair rumba-boogie \\"Mardi Gras in New Orleans\\" (1949), employs the 2‚Äì3 clave onbeat/offbeat motif. 2-3 clave is written above the piano excerpt for reference. Piano excerpt from the rumba boogie \\"Mardi Gras in New Orleans\\" (1949) by Professor Longhair. 2-3 clave is written above for rhythmic reference. Johnny Otis Johnny Otis released the R&B; mambo \\"Mambo Boogie\\" in January 1951, featuring congas, maracas, claves, and mambo saxophone guajeos in a blues progression.Boggs, Vernon (1993: 30-31). \\"Johnny Otis R&B;/Mambo Pioneer\\" Latin Beat Magazine. v. 3 n. 9. Nov. Listen: \\"Mambo Boogie\\" by Johnny Otis (1951). This is a syncopated, but straight subdivision feel of Cuban music (as opposed to swung subdivisions). Alexander Stewart states that this popular feel was passed along from \\"New Orleans‚Äîthrough James Brown's music, to the popular music of the 1970s,\\" adding: \\"The singular style of rhythm & blues that emerged from New Orleans in the years after World War II played an important role in the development of funk. In a related development, the underlying rhythms of American popular music underwent a basic, yet generally unacknowledged transition from triplet or shuffle feel to even or straight eighth notes.Stewart (2000: 293). Concerning funk motifs, Stewart states: \\"This model, it should be noted, is different from a time line (such as clave and tresillo) in that it is not an exact pattern, but more of a loose organizing principle.\\"Stewart (2000: 306). James Brown The onbeat/offbeat motif is the basis for a great deal of funk music. Blues scales give these rhythmic figures their own distinct quality. The main guitar riff for James Brown's \\"Bring It Up\\" is an example of an onbeat/offbeat motif. Rhythmically, the pattern is similar to the typical Cuban guajeo structure, but tonally, it is unmistakably funky.\\"John Storm Roberts cites many examples of Latin-tinged 1950s rhythm and blues, from artists such as Professor Longhair, Ruth Brown, Clyde McPhatter and Ray Charles. Roberts believes that R&B; became a 'vehicle for the return of the Latin tinge to mass popular music'\\"‚ÄîStewart (2000: 295). Bongos are used on the 1967 version. The rhythm is slightly swung. \\"Ain't It Funky Now\\" has a 2‚Äì3 guitar riff (c. late 1960s). \\"Give It Up or Turnit a Loose\\" (1969) has a similarly funky 2‚Äì3 structure. The tonal structure has a bare bones simplicity, emphasizing the pattern of attack-points. Beatles The onbeat/offbeat motif has been a part of rock 'n' roll since the inception of that genre. The guitar riff of the Beatles' \\"I Feel Fine\\" is built on the onbeat/offbeat motif. It fits perfectly with 2‚Äì3 clave. Today, the 2‚Äì3 onbeat/offbeat motif is a staple of North American popular music, even popular music worldwide. It is a motif that originated in sub-Saharan Africa, arrived in the United States in the form of Afro-Cuban music, was absorbed, and reconstituted, then spread globally in the form of rock 'n' roll. African electric guitar: reinterpreting Afro-Cuban guajeos Cuban music has been popular in sub-Saharan Africa since the mid 20th century. To the Africans, clave-based Cuban popular music sounded both familiar and exotic.Nigerian musician Segun Bucknor: \\"Latin American music and our music is virtually the same\\"‚Äîquoted by Collins, John (1992: 62). West African Pop Roots. Philadelphia: Temple University Press. The Encyclopedia of Africa v. 1. states: > \\"Beginning in the 1940s, Afro-Cuban [son] groups such as Septeto Habanero > and Trio Matamoros gained widespread popularity in the Congo region as a > result of airplay over Radio Congo Belge, a powerful radio station based in > L√©opoldville (now Kinshasa DRC).

Banning Eyre distills down the Congolese guitar style to this skeletal figure, where clave is sounded by the bass notes (notated with downward stems).After Banning Eyre (2006: 13). \\"Highlife guitar example\\" Africa: Your Passport to a New World of Music. Alfred Pub. Congolese \\"rumba\\" Congolese bands started doing Cuban covers and singing the lyrics phonetically. Eventually they created their own original Cuban-like compositions, with lyrics sung in French or Lingala, a lingua franca of the western Congo region. The Africans adapted guajeos to electric guitars, and gave them their own regional flavor. The Congolese called this new music rumba, although it was really based on the son. The following example is from the Congolese \\"rumba\\" \\"Passi ya boloko\\" by Franco (Luambo Makiadi) and O.K. Jazz (c. mid-1950s).Stone, Ruth. Ed. (1998: 360). The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music. v. 1 Africa. New York: Garland. The bass is playing a tresillo-based tumbao, typical of son montuno. The rhythm guitar plays all of the offbeats, the exact pattern of the rhythm guitar in Cuban son. According to the Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, the lead guitar part \\"recalls the blue-tinged guitar solos heard in bluegrass and rockabilly music of the 1950s, with its characteristic insistence on the opposition of the major-third and minor-third degrees of the scale.\\"Stone, Ruth. Ed. (1998: 361). The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music. v. 1 Africa. \\"Passi ya boloko\\" by Franco (c. mid-1950s). From top: lead guitar; rhythm guitar; bass guitar. Congolese soukous The guitar-based music gradually spread out from the Congo, increasingly taking on local sensibilities. This process eventually resulted in the establishment of several different distinct regional genres, such as soukous.Roberts, John Storm. Afro-Cuban Comes Home: The Birth and Growth of Congo Music. Original Music cassette tape (1986). Some African guitar genres such as Zimbabwean chimurenga (created by Thomas Mapfumo), are a direct adaptation of traditional ostinatos, in this case mbira music. Most genres though, maintain to some degree, a guajeo template upon which indigenous elements were grafted. Congolese soukous is an example of the latter case. The horn guajeos of Cuban popular music were adapted by soukous guitars.Roberts, Afro-Cuban Comes Home (1986). In a densely textured seben section of a soukous song (below), the three interlocking guitar parts are reminiscent of the Cuban practice of layering guajeos.Stone, Ruth. Ed. (1998: 365).

This arpeggiated highlife guitar part is essentially a guajeo.Eyre, Banning (2006: 9). \\"Highlife guitar example\\" Africa: Your Passport to a New World of Music. Alfred Pub. The rhythmic pattern is known in Cuba as baqueteo. The pattern of attack-points is nearly identical to the 3-2 clave motif guajeo shown earlier in this article. The bell pattern known in Cuba as clave, is indigenous to Ghana and Nigeria, and is used in highlife.Pe√±alosa (2010: 247). The Clave Matrix; Afro-Cuban Rhythm: Its Principles and African Origins. Redway, CA: Bembe Inc. . Top: clave. Bottom highlife guitar part (). Nigerian afrobeat Afrobeat is a combination of traditional Yoruba music, highlife, jazz, and funk, popularised in Africa in the 1970s. The Nigerian multi-instrumentalist and bandleader Fela Kuti, who gave it its name, used it to revolutionise musical structure as well as the political context in his native Nigeria. Kuti coined the term \\"afrobeat\\" upon his return from a U.S. tour with his group Nigeria '70 (formerly Koola Lobitos). The following afrobeat guitar part is a variant of the 2-3 onbeat/offbeat motif.Graff, Folo (2001: 17). \\"Afrobeat\\" by Folo Graff. African Guitar Styles. Lawndale CA: ADG Productions.

Cuban popular music played a major role in the development of many contemporary genres of African popular music. John Storm Roberts states: \\"It was the Cuban connection ... that provided the major and enduring influences‚Äîthe ones that went deeper than earlier imitation or passing fashion. The Cuban connection began very early and was to last at least twenty years, being gradually absorbed and re-Africanized.\\"Roberts 1986. 20: 50. Afro-Cuban Comes Home: The Birth and Growth of Congo Music. The re- working of Afro-Cuban rhythmic patterns by Africans brings the rhythms full circle. The re-working of the harmonic patterns reveals a striking difference in perception. The I IV V IV harmonic progression, so common in Cuban music, is heard in pop music all across the African continent, thanks to the influence of Cuban music. Those chords move in accordance with the basic tenets of Western music theory. However, as Gerhard Kubik points out, performers of African popular music do not necessarily perceive these progressions in the same way: \\"The harmonic cycle of C-F-G-F [I-IV-V-IV] prominent in Congo/Zaire popular music simply cannot be defined as a progression from tonic to subdominant to dominant and back to subdominant (on which it ends) because in the performer's appreciation they are of equal status, and not in any hierarchical order as in Western music.\\"Kubik, Gerhard (1999: 105).

First war with Rome The Latins first went to war with Rome in the 7th century BC during the reign of the Roman king Ancus Marcius. According to Livy the war was commenced by the Latins who anticipated Ancus would follow the pious pursuit of peace adopted by his grandfather, Numa Pompilius. The Latins initially made an incursion on Roman lands. When a Roman embassy sought restitution for the damage, the Latins gave a contemptuous reply. Ancus accordingly declared war on the Latins. The declaration is notable since, according to Livy, it was the first time that the Romans had declared war by means of the rites of the fetials.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1:32 Ancus Marcius marched from Rome with a newly levied army and took the Latin town of Politorium by storm. Its residents were removed to settle on the Aventine Hill in Rome as new citizens, following the Roman traditions from wars with the Sabines and Albans. When the other Latins subsequently occupied the empty town of Politorium, Ancus took the town again and demolished it.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1:33 Further citizens were removed to Rome when Ancus conquered the Latin towns of Telleni and Ficana. The war then focused on the Latin town of Medullia. The town had a strong garrison and was well fortified. Several engagements took place outside the town and the Romans were eventually victorious. Ancus returned to Rome with much loot. More Latins were brought to Rome as citizens and were settled at the foot of the Aventine near the Palatine Hill, by the temple of Murcia. War with Rome under Tarquinius Priscus When Rome was ruled by Lucius Tarquinius Priscus the Latins went to war with Rome on two occasions. On the first, which according to the Fasti Triumphales occurred prior to 588 BC, Tarquinius took the Latin town of Apiolae by storm, and from there brought back a great amount of loot to Rome.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1:35 On the second occasion, Tarquinius subdued the entirety of Latium, and took a number of towns that belonged to the Latins or which had revolted to them: Corniculum, old Ficulea, Cameria, Crustumerium, Ameriola, Medullia and Nomentum, before agreeing to peace.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1:38 War between Clusium and Aricia In 508 BC, Lars Porsena king of Clusium (at that time reputed to be one of the most powerful cities of Etruria) departed Rome after ending his war against Rome by peace treaty. Porsena split his forces, and sent part of the Clusian army with his son Aruns to besiege the Latin city of Aricia. The Aricians sent for assistance from the Latin League, and also from the Greek city of Cumae. When support arrived, the Arician army ventured beyond the walls of the city, and the combined armies met the Clusian forces in battle. According to Livy, the Clusians initially routed the Arician forces, but the Cumaean troops allowed the Clusians to pass by, then attacked from the rear, gaining victory against the Clusians. Livy says the Clusian army was destroyed.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2.14 The Pometian revolt In 503 BC two Latin towns, Pometia and Cora, said by Livy to be colonies of Rome, revolted against Rome. They had the assistance of the southern Aurunci tribe. Livy says that a Roman army led by the consuls Agrippa Menenius Lanatus and Publius Postumius Tubertus met the enemy on the frontiers and was victorious, after which Livy says the war was confined to Pometia. Livy says many enemy prisoners were slaughtered by each side.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2.16 Livy also says that the consuls celebrated a triumph, however the Fasti Triumphales record that an ovation was celebrated by Postumius and a triumph by Menenius, both over the Sabines. In the following year the consuls were Opiter Virginius and Sp. Cassius. Livy says that they attempted to take Pometia by storm, but then resorted to siege engines. However the Aurunci launched a successful sally, destroying the siege engines, wounding many, and nearly killing one of the consuls. The Romans retreated to Rome, recruited additional troops, and returned to Pometia. They rebuilt the siege engines and when they were about to take the town, the Pometians surrendered. The Aurunci leaders were beheaded, the Pometians sold into slavery, the town razed and the land sold. Livy says the consuls celebrated a triumph as a result of the victory.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2.17 The Fasti Triumphales record only one triumph, by Cassius (possibly over the Sabines although the inscription is unclear). The battle of Lake Regillus and the foedus Cassianum In 501 BC word reached Rome that thirty of the Latin cities had joined in league against Rome, at the instigation of Octavius Mamilius of Tusculum. Because of this (and also because of a dispute with the Sabines), Titus Lartius was appointed as Rome's first dictator, with Spurius Cassius as his magister equitum.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2:18 However war with the Latins did not come to pass until at least two years later. In 499 BC, or possibly 496 BC, war broke out. At first Fidenae was besieged (although it is not clear by whom), Crustumerium was captured (again it is not clear by whom), and Praeneste defected to the Romans. Aulus Postumius was appointed dictator, with Titus Aebutius Elva as his magister equitum. With the Roman army, they marched into the Latin territory and were victorious at the Battle of Lake Regillus.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2:19‚Äì20 Shortly afterwards, in 495 BC, the Latins resisted calls from the Volsci to join with them to attack Rome, and went so far as to deliver the Volscian ambassadors to Rome. The Roman senate, in gratitude, granted freedom to 6,000 Latin prisoners, and in return the Latins sent a crown of gold to the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus in Rome. A great crowd formed, including the freed Latin prisoners, who thanked their captors. Great bonds of friendship were said to have arisen between the Romans and the Latins as a result of this event. The Latins also warned Rome of the Volscian invasion which occurred shortly after in the same yearLivy, Ab urbe condita, 2.22, 24 In 493 a treaty, the Foedus Cassianum, was concluded, establishing a mutual military alliance between the Latin cities with Rome as the leading partner. A second people, the Hernici, joined the alliance sometime later. While the precise workings of the Latin League remains uncertain, its overall purpose seems clear. During the 5th century the Latins were threatened by invasion from the Aequi and the Volsci, as part of a larger pattern of Sabellian-speaking peoples migrating out of the Apennines and into the plains. Several peripheral Latin communities appear to have been overrun, and the ancient sources record fighting against either the Aequi, the Volsci, or both almost every year during the first half of the 5th century. This annual warfare would have been dominated by raids and counter-raids rather than the pitched battles described by the ancient sources. Defection of the Latins from Rome (389‚Äì385) In 390 a Gaulish warband first defeated the Roman army at the Battle of the Allia and then sacked Rome. According to Livy the Latins and Hernici, after a hundred years of loyal friendship with Rome, used this opportunity to break their treaty with Rome in 389.Livy, 6.2.3‚Äì4; Plutarch, Camillus 33.1 (who does not mention the Hernici) In his narrative of the years that followed, Livy describes a steady deterioration of relations between Rome and the Latins. In 387 the situation with Latins and Hernici was brought up in the Roman senate, but the matter was dropped when news reached Rome that Etruria was in arms.Livy, 6.6.2‚Äì3 In 386 the Antiates invaded the Pomptine territory and it was reported in Rome that the Latins had sent warriors to assist them. The Latins claimed they had not sent aid to the Antiates, but had not prohibited individuals from volunteering for such service.Livy, 6.6.4‚Äì5 A Roman army under Marcus Furius Camillus and P. Valerius Potitus Poplicola met the Antiates at Satricum. In addition to Volscians the Antiates had brought a large number of Latins and Hernicians to the field.Livy, 7.7.1 In the battle that followed the Romans were victorious and the Volscians were slaughtered in great number. The Latins and Hernicians now abandoned the Volscians, and Satricum fell to Camillus.Livy, 6.8.4‚Äì10 The Romans demanded to know from the Latins and Hernici why for the last few years' wars they had not furnished any contingents. They claimed not to have been able to supply troops due to fear of Volscian incursions. The Roman senate considered this defence to be insufficient, but that time was not right for war.Livy, 6.10.6‚Äì9 In 385 the Romans appointed Aulus Cornelius Cossus Dictator to deal with the Volscian war.Livy, 6.11.9 The Dictator marched his army into the Pomptine territory, which he had heard was being invaded by the Volscians.Livy, 6.12.1 The Volscian army was once again swelled by Latins and Hernici, including contingents from the Roman colonies of Circeii and Velitrae, and in the battle that followed the Romans were once again victorious. The majority of the captives were found to be Hernici and Latins, including men of high rank, which the Romans took as proof that their states were formally assisting the Volscians.Livy, 6.12.6‚Äì11 & 6.13.1‚Äì8 However the sedition of Marcus Manlius Capitolinus prevented Rome from declaring war on the Latins.Livy, 6.14.1 When the Latins, Hernici, and the colonists of Circeii and Velitrae tried to persuade the Romans to release those of their countrymen who had been made prisoner, they were refused.Livy, 6.17.7‚Äì8 That same year Satricum was colonized with 2,000 Roman citizens, each to receive two and a half jugera of land.Livy, 6.15.2 Some modern historians have questioned Livy's portrayal of the Latins as rebelling from Rome. Cornell (1995) believes that there was no armed uprising of Latins, rather the military alliance between Rome and the other Latin towns seems to have been allowed to wither. In the preceding decades Rome had grown considerably in power, especially with the conquest of Veii, and the Romans might now have preferred freedom of action to the obligations of the alliance. Also, several Latin towns appear to have remain allied to Rome; based on later events these would have included at least Tusculum and Lanuvium to which Cornell adds Aricia, Lavinium and Ardea. The colonies of Circeii and Velitrae are likely to have remained partly inhabited by Volsci, which helps explain their rebellion, but these two settlements more than any other Latin towns would have felt vulnerable to Rome's aggressive designs for the Pomptine region. Division among the Latins is also the stance taken by Oakley (1997) who substantially accepts Cornell's analysis. The continued loyalty of Ardea, Aricia, Gabii, Labicum, Lanuvium and Lavinium would help explain how Roman armies could operate in the Pomptine region. In their writings on the early Roman Republic Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus often mention men from states formally at peace with Rome fighting in the armies of Rome's enemies in a private capacity. Though this might genuinely reflect Italic warfare of this era, Livy appears here to be using it as a literary motif to bring continuity to his narrative of the 380s.Oakley, pp. 446‚Äì447 War between Rome and Praeneste (383‚Äì379) In the last years of the 380s Praeneste emerged as the leading Latin city in opposition to Rome. In terms of territory Praeneste was the third largest city in Latium, but between 499 and 383 Praeneste is wholly absent from the sources and much of the fighting against the Aequi by Rome and the Latin League appear to have taken place to the south of her territory. Modern historians have therefore proposed that Praeneste was overrun or at least came to some kind of understanding with the Aequi. If this was the case Praeneste would not have been part of the Latin League for most of the 5th century. The end of the Aequan threat by the early 4th century freed Praeneste to move against Rome.Cornell, pp. 306, 322‚Äì323Oakley, p. 338 Outbreak Livy records that in 383 Lanuvium, which had so far been loyal to Rome, rebelled. In Rome, on the advice of the senate, the tribes unanimously declared for war on Velitrae after five commissioners had been appointed to distribute the Pomptine territory and three to settle a colony at Nepete. However, there was pestilence in Rome throughout the year and no campaign was launched. Among the revolting colonists a peace party was in favour of asking Rome for pardon, but the war party continued to hold the population's favour and a raid was launched into Roman territory, effectively ending all talk of peace. There was also a rumour that Praeneste had revolted, and the peoples of Tusculum, Gabii and Labici complained that their territories had been invaded, but the Roman senate refused to believe these charges.Livy, 6.21.2‚Äì9 In 382 consular tribunes Sp. and L. Papirius marched against Velitrae, their four colleagues being left to defend Rome. The Romans defeated the Veliternian army, which included a large number of Praenestine auxiliaries, but refrained from storming the place, doubting whether a storm would be successful and not wanting to destroy the colony. Based on the report of the tribunes, Rome declared war on Praeneste.Livy, 6.22.1‚Äì3 Of all the old Latin towns, Lanuvium was closest to Pomptine plain; it is therefore no surprise that she now joined the struggle against Rome.Cornell, p. 322 Rumours of wars about to break out are common in Livy's writings, but of doubtful historicity; such rumours would have been easy inventions for the annalists seeking to bring life to their narratives. However, some of them may be based on authentic records; if this is the case here, it may represent an attempt by Praeneste to win over the Latin cities still loyal to Rome.Oakley, pp. 356, 573‚Äì574 While the details provided by Livy for the campaign of 382 are plausible, the original records likely only stated there was fighting against Praeneste and Velitrae.Oakley, p. 357 Livy and Plutarch provide parallel narratives for 381. In that year the Volsci and Praenestines are said to have joined forces and, according to Livy, successfully stormed the Roman colony of Satricum. In response the Romans elected M. Furius Camillus as consular tribune for the sixth time. Camillus was assigned the Volscian war by special senatorial decree. His fellow tribune L. Furius Medullinus was chosen by lot to be his colleague in this undertaking.Livy, 6.22.3‚Äì4; Plutarch, Camillus 37.2 There are some differences between Livy and Plutarch in their accounts of the campaign that followed. According to Livy the tribunes marched out from the Esquiline Gate for Satricum with an army of four legions, each consisting of 4000 men. At Satricum they met an army considerably superior in number and eager for battle. Camillus however refused to engage the enemy, seeking instead to protract the war. This exasperated his colleague, L. Furius, who claimed that Camillus had become too old and slow and soon won over the whole army to his side. While his colleague prepared for battle, Camillus formed a strong reserve and awaited the outcome of the battle. The Volsci started to retire soon after the battle had started, and, as they had planned, the Romans were drawn into following them up the rising ground toward the Volscian camp. Here the Volsci had placed several cohorts in reserve and these joined the battle. Fighting uphill against superior numbers, the Romans started to flee. However Camillus brought up the reserves and rallied the fleeing soldiers to stand their ground. With the infantry wavering, the Roman cavalry, now led by L. Furius, dismounted and attacked the enemy on foot. As a result, the Volsci were defeated and fled in panic, and their camp was taken. A large number of Volsci were killed and an even larger number taken prisoners.Livy, 6.22.7‚Äì24.11 According to Plutarch, a sick Camillus was waiting in the camp while his colleague engaged the enemy. When he heard that Romans had been routed, he sprung from his couch, rallied the soldiers and stopped the enemy pursuit. Then, on the second day, Camillus led his forces out, defeated the enemy in battle and took their camp. Camillus then learned that Satricum had been taken by the Etruscans and all the Roman colonists there slaughtered. He sent the bulk of his forces back to Rome, while he and the youngest men fell upon the Etruscans and expelled them from Satricum.Plutarch, Camillus 37.3‚Äì5 Of the two versions of this battle that have been preserved, Plutarch's is thought to be closer to the earlier annalists than that of Livy. Notably, Livy presents a more noble picture of Camillus than Plutarch, and he has also compressed all the fighting into one day rather than two.Okley, p. 580 That the Praenestines should have joined with the Volsci at Satricum and been defeated there by Camillus is credible enough; however, most, if not all, the details surrounding the battle, including the supposed quarrel between Camillus and L. Furius, are today considered to be later inventions. Especially the scale of the battle and the Roman victory have been vastly exaggerated. Roman annexation of Tusculum Having described Camillus' victory against the Volsci, Livy and Plutarch move on to a conflict with Tusculum. According to Livy, Camillus found Tusculans among the prisoners taken in the battle against the Volscians. Camillus brought these back to Rome, and after the prisoners had been examined, war was declared on Tusculum.Livy, 6.25.1‚Äì5 According to Plutarch, Camillus had just returned to Rome with the spoils when it was reported that the Tusculans were about to rebel.Plutarch, Camillus 38.1 The conduct of the war was entrusted to Camillus, who chose L. Furius as his colleague. Tusculum, however, offered no resistance whatsoever, and when Camillus entered the city he found everyone going about their daily life as if there was no war. Camillus ordered the leading men of Tusculum to go to Rome and plead their case. This they did with the dictator of Tusculum as the spokesman. The Romans granted Tusculum peace and not long after full citizenship.Livy, 6.25.5‚Äì26.8; D.H. xiv 6; Plutarch, Camillus 38.1‚Äì4; Cass. fr. 28.2 By 381 Tusculum was almost surrounded by Roman territory and her annexation was a logical step for Rome. Besides increasing Roman territory and manpower, this had the additional benefit of separating Tibur and Praeneste from the cities on the Alban hills.Cornell, p. 323, Oakley p. 357 Tusculum became the first Roman municipium, a self-governing city of Roman citizens. Some modern historians have argued that this episode has been invented or is a retrojection of later events. Cornell (1995) Oakley (1998) and Forsythe (2005) accept the incorporation of Tusculum in 381 as historical. Livy and other later writers portrayed the annexation of Tusculum as a benevolent act, but this view more properly reflect their own times, when Roman citizenship was highly sought after. In the 4th century when the Latin cities struggled to maintain their independence from Rome, it would have been seen as an aggressive act. Later events reveal that Tusculum was not yet firmly in Roman hands.Cornell, p. 323-324, Oakley p. 357 In the Roman period the chief magistrates of Tusuclum had the title of aedile, but it is possible, as Livy claims, that in 381 Tusculum was governed by a dictator.Oakley p. 603-604 Dictatorship of T. Quinctius Cincinnatus Roman military campaign against Praeneste and Velitrae by T.Quinctus Cincinnatus Capitolinus in 380 BC Livy provides the only full narrative for 380. After a failed census in Rome, the plebeian tribunes started agitating for debt relief and obstructed the enrollment of fresh legions for the war against Praeneste. Not even the news that the Praenestines had advanced into the district of Gabii deterred the tribunes. Learning that Rome had no army in the field, the Praenestine army pushed on until it stood before the Colline Gate. Alarmed, the Romans appointed T. Quinctius Cincinnatus as Dictator with A. Sempronius Atratinus as his Master of the Horse and assembled the army. In response the Praenestines withdrew to the Allia where they set up camp, hoping that memories of their earlier defeat against the Gauls at the same place would cause dread among the Romans. The Romans, however, recalled their previous victories against the Latins and relished the chance of wiping out previous defeats. The Dictator ordered A. Sempronius to charge the Praenestine center with the cavalry; the Dictator would then attack the disordered enemy with the legions. The Praenestines broke at the first charge. In the panic they abandoned their camp, the flight not stopping until they were within sight of Praeneste. At first unwilling to abandon the countryside to the Romans, the Praenestines established a second camp, but on the arrival of the Romans this second camp was also abandoned and the Praenestines retreated behind the walls of their city. The Romans first captured eight towns subordinated to Praeneste and then marched on Velitrae which was stormed. When the Roman army arrived before Praeneste the Praenestines surrendered. Having defeated the enemy in battle and captured two camps and nine towns, Titus Quinctius returned to Rome in triumph, carrying with him from Praeneste a statue of Jupiter Imperator. This statue was set up on the Capitol between the shrines of Jupiter and Minerva with the inscription \\"Jupiter and all the gods granted that the dictator Titus Quinctius should capture nine towns\\". Titus Quinctius laid down his office on the twentieth day after his appointment.Livy, 6.27.3‚Äì29.10 According to D.H. and Festus the nine towns were captured in nine days.D.H., XIV 5 Festus further adds that Quinctius captured Praeneste on the tenth and dedicated a golden crown weighing two and one third of a pound.Fest. 498L s.v. trientem tertium D.S. also records a Roman victory in battle against the Praenestines in this year, but does not provide any details.D.S, xv.47.8 According to Livy, the next year, 379, the Praenestines renewed hostilities by instigating revolts among the Latins;Livy, 6.30.8 however, apart from this notice Praeneste is not mentioned again in the sources until 358. Modern historians generally accept the core of Livy's account of Titus Quinctius' dictatorship and its dating to 380. Thus that he captured nine towns subordinated to Praeneste and forced the Praenestines to sue for peace is considered historical.Cornell, p. 323; Oakley, p. 358; Forsythe, p. 258 Oakley (1998) also believes Quinctius' victory in pitched battle could be historical, and maybe also his capture of Velitrae as well. No fighting is reported against Velitrae until 369, but this could also be a later invention. However, the claims that the Praenestines marched on Rome via Gabii and the placement of the battle at the Allia are of very doubtful historicity.Oakley, pp. 358, 608‚Äì609 With regards to the discrepancies between Livy and Festus, Oakley believes that Festus, while mistaken when claiming that Praeneste was stormed, was correct in stating that T, Quinctius dedicated a crown rather than, more magnificently, bringing back a statue from Praeneste. Titus Quinctius Flamininus is said to have brought back a statue of Jupiter from Macedonia after his victories in the Second Macedonian War two centuries later and these two events have become then confused.Oakley, p. 608 This view is accepted by Forsythe (2005).Forsythe, p. 258 Forsythe considers T. Quinctius Cincinnatus' inscription to be origin of the more famous, but in Forsythe's view fictitious, story of Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus' dictatorship and victory against the Aequi in 458 BC.Forsythe, p. 206 Destruction of Satricum (377) According to Livy, in 377 the Volsci and Latins united their forces at Satricum. The Roman army, commanded by consular tribunes P. Valerius Potitus Poplicola and L. Aemilius Mamercinus, marched against them. The battle that followed was interrupted on the first day by a rainstorm. On the second the Latin resisted the Romans for some time, being familiar with their tactics, but a cavalry charge disrupted their ranks and when the Roman infantry followed up with a fresh attack they were routed. The Volsci and Latins retreated first to Satricum and thence to Antium. The Romans pursued, but lacked the equipment to lay siege to Antium. After a quarrel whether to continue the war or sue for peace, the Latin forces departed and the Antiates surrendered their city to the Romans. In fury the Latins set fire to Satricum and burned the whole city down except the temple of Mater Matuta ‚Äì a voice coming from the temple is said to have threatened terrible punishment if the fire was not kept away from the shrine. Next the Latins attacked Tusculum. Taken by surprise, the whole city fell except the citadel. A Roman army under consular tribunes L. Quinctius Cincinnatus and Ser. Sulpicius Rufus marched to the Tusculans' relief. The Latins attempted to defend the walls, but caught between the Roman assault and the Tusculans sallying from the citadel they were all killed.Livy, 6.32.4‚Äì33.12 Mater Matuta was a deity originally connected with the early morning light, and the temple at Satricum was the chief centre of her cult.Oakley, pp. 642‚Äì643 However, Livy also records the burning of Satricum, except the temple of Mater Matuta, in 346, this time by the Romans. Modern historians agree that this twice burning of Satricum in 377 and 346 is a doublet. Beloch, believing that the Romans would not have recorded a Latin attack on Satricum, considered the burning in 377 a retrojection of the events of 346. Oakley (1997) takes the opposite view, believing that the ancient historians are less likely to have invented the burning by the Latins than the burning by the Romans. Though the twice miraculous saving of the temple is discarded as a doublet, it does not automatically follow that hotly contested Satricum could not have been captured both in 377 and 346.Oakley, p. 352 Latin displeasure with Tusculum's annexation by Rome could explain why they might also have acted in support of an anti-Roman revolt.Oakley, p. 359 War between Rome and Tibur (361‚Äì354) Tibur was one of the largest Latin cities, but is only scarcely attested in the sources. Like Praeneste, Tibur might therefore have been overrun or detached from the Latin League by the Aequi in the 5th century. Livy then records a long war between Rome and Tibur lasting from 361 to 354. Two triumphs connected to this war are recorded in the Fasti Triumphales. From a notice in Diodorus Siculus, it appears that also Praeneste was at war with Rome in this time period, but, except in connection with the Gallic invasion of 358, Praeneste is nowhere mentioned in Livy's account of this time period.Oakley, p. 5-6 Tibur allies with the Gauls According to Livy the immediate cause for this war came in 361 when the Tiburtes closed their gates against a Roman army returning from a campaign a Q. Servilius Ahala as dictator. The dictator defeated the Gauls in a battle near the Colline Gate. The Gauls fled towards Tibur, but were intercepted by the consul. The Tiburtes sallied in a failed attempt to assist their allies, and both the Tiburtes and Gauls were driven within the gates. The dictator praised the consuls and laid down his office. Poetilius celebrated a double triumph over the Gauls and the Tiburtes, but the Tiburtes belittled the achievements of the Romans.Livy, 7.11.2‚Äì11 The Fasti Triumphales records that C. Poetelius Libo Visolus, consul, celebrated a triumph over the Gauls and Tiburtes on 29 July. According to Livy in 359 the Tiburtes marched at night against the City of Rome. The Romans were at first alarmed, but when daylight revealed a comparatively small force, the consuls attacked from two separate gates and the Tiburtines were routed.Livy, 7.12.1‚Äì5 There are some inconsistencies in what caused the war between Rome and Tibur, and much of the details for these years are likely invented. The historicity of this Gallic war is itself somewhat dubious; this, along with the fact that both Livy and F.T. assign the triumph to the consul, have led to doubts about the historicity of Servilius' dictatorship as well.Oakley, pp. 7, 151 Renewed alliance between Roman and the Latins In 358 Latium was again threatened by invasion from the Gauls. Livy records that the Romans granted a new treaty to the Latins on their request. The Latins sent a strong contingent to fight against the Gauls, who had reached Praeneste and settled in the country round Pedum, in accordance with the old treaty which for many years had not been observed.Livy, 7.12.7 Led by the Roman dictator C. Sulpicius Peticus, the Roman-Latin army defeated the Gauls. In this year Rome also established the Pomptina tribe.Livy, 7.15.12 We have no knowledge precisely who these Latins were, or if they had been at war with Rome in the preceding years. The other Latin states cannot have been pleased with the now-permanent Roman presence in the Pomptine region, but the seriousness of the Gallic threat would have provided motive for resuming their alliance with Rome. However, Tibur and Praeneste evidently remained hostile to Rome.Cornell p.324; Oakley, p. 5 None of the other Latin states are recorded as hostile to Rome and presumably continued to supply contingents after 358, and this might be one of the reasons behind the increased pace of Roman expansion during the 350s and 340s.Oakley, p. 7 Conclusion of the war Livy only provides brief descriptions of the final years of this war. In 356, consul M. Popilius Laenas commanded against the Tiburtes. He drove them into their city and ravaged their fields.Livy, 7.17.2 In 355, the Romans took Empulum from the Tiburtes without serious fighting. According to some of the writers consulted by Livy, both consuls, C. Sulpicius Peticus and M. Valerius Poplicola, commanded against the Tiburtes; according to others, it was only Valerius, while Sulpicius campaigned against the Tarquinienses.Livy, 7.18.1‚Äì2 Then, in 354, the Romans took Sassula from Tibur. After this, the Tiburtes surrendered and the war was brought to a conclusion. A triumph was celebrated against the Tiburtes.Livy, 7.19.1‚Äì2 The Fasti Triumphales records that M. Fabius Ambustus, consul, triumphed over the Tiburtes on 3 June. D.S. records that Rome made peace with Praeneste this year.D.S., xvi.45.8 This is the only recorded mention of Empulum and Sassula. They must have been small towns located in territory controlled by Tibur, but their precise locations are unknown. Modern historians consider the capture of such obscure sites unlikely to be invented; they might here ultimately derive from pontifical records of captured towns.Oakley, pp. 6, 193, 196; Forsythe p. 277 While not all the fighting recorded in this war appears to have been very serious, Tribur and Praeneste must have been worn down by continuous warfare when they sued for peace in 354. They are not heard from again before the outbreak of the great Latin War in 340.Oakley, p. 6 The Latin War (340‚Äì338) With the Latin War the Latins and the Volsci made a final bid to shake off Roman dominion. Once again Rome was victorious. In the peace settlement that followed, Rome annexed some states outright, while others remained autonomous Latin states, but the Latin League was dissolved. Instead the surviving Latin states were bound to Rome by separate bilateral treaties. The Campanians, who had sided with the Latins, were organized as civitas sine suffragio ‚Äì citizenship without a vote ‚Äì which gave them all the rights and duties of a Roman citizen, including that of military service, except the right to vote in the Roman assemblies. This peace settlement was to become a template for how Rome later dealt with other defeated states.

Walker served at Weldon, North Carolina from October 29, 1864 to May 1, 1865 and was in command in North Carolina at the end of the war. He was paroled at Greensboro, North Carolina on May 1, 1865. Aftermath After the Civil War, Walker moved to Georgia. William Stephen Walker died at Atlanta Georgia on June 7, 1899. He is buried in Oakland Cemetery at Atlanta.

The wreck site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. History Noquebay was built in 1872. Although originally built as a schooner, she later was modified for use as a towable barge for hauling lumber. Noquebay, along with another ship named Mautenee, was towed by the steamship Lizzie Madden. T. H. Madden, operator of the Madden Company, owned all three vessels. On October 3, 1905, the Comstock and Wilcox Company of Ashland, Wisconsin, loaded Noquebay with 600,000 board- feet of hemlock lumber. There she waited six days for Mautenee and Lizzie Madden to return from Duluth, Minnesota. On the morning of October 9, the three vessels pulled away from nearby Bayfield, Wisconsin, heading to Buffalo, New York, to deliver their cargo. Shortly after their departure, a fire was discovered aboard Noquebay. The fire apparently started in the compartment containing the donkey boiler. Because the fire was too severe to extinguish, the crew threw some cargo overboard to save it, and jumped from the burning ship. All of them climbed safely aboard Lizzie Madden. There was nothing Lizzie Madden could do but abandon the burning ship and continue on the journey towing Mautenee. When they reached the Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, they wired ahead to Buffalo, then contacted Ashland with the news.

He is celebrated for his raids against the Byzantines.  Life  Yazaman appears for the first time in September/October 882. At the time he was a servant (mawla) of al-Fath ibn Khaqan, and was attacked and imprisoned by the governor of the Cilician borderlands, Khalaf al-Farghani, who had been appointed by Ahmad ibn Tulun, the autonomous ruler of Egypt and Syria. Yazaman was freed by the local people, who then rose up and rejected Tulunid rule, appointing Yazaman as their leader instead and returning to Abbasid allegiance. Ibn Tulun then marched on Tarsus, but the inhabitants opened the sluice gates and flooded the plain around the city, forcing Ibn Tulun to return to Damascus without achieving anything. In 883, Yazaman faced a large Byzantine army sent against Tarsus, under the command of the Domestic of the Schools, Kesta Stypeiotes. Yazaman attacked the Byzantine camp at Bab Qalamyah, some 12 km from Tarsus, during the night of 11 September, catching the Byzantines by surprise. The Byzantine forces scattered, Stypeiotes and the strategoi of Anatolikon and Cappadocia were killed, and much booty was captured. Yazaman led a major naval raid soon thereafter against the fortress of Euripos (Chalkis), comprising 30 large ships (of the type called koumbaria in Greek), but it was beaten off with great loss by the local governor of Hellas, Oineiates. The historian al-Tabari records that Yazaman also led a land raid in January/February 886 up to al- Maskanin (unidentified), and returned to Tarsus with no casualties but with much booty and captives. Probably in the summer of the same year, he also led a naval raid that captured four Byzantine ships. Despite his earlier opposition to them, in 890 Yazaman swore allegiance to the Tulunids, under Ibn Tulun's son Khumarawayh. On 4 October 891, a Tulunid officer, Ahmad ibn Tughan al-Ujayfi, arrived at Tarsus. Together with him, Yazaman led another raid against Byzantine territories. The Muslims laid siege to the Byzantine fortress of Salandu, but on 22 October Yazaman was wounded by a stone thrown by a catapult. This caused the Muslims to break off the siege, and he died on the next day on the way back. His troops carried him to Tarsus, and buried him at the \\"Gate of Jihad\\". He was succeeded by Ahmad ibn Tughan al-Ujayfi. Tarsus remained under Tulunid control until 897, when it was recovered by the Abbasids. Yazaman's death was a keenly felt loss for the Muslims, who considered him as one of their most valiant champions, alongside Umar al-Aqta and Ali al-Armani. The Arab sources report that the mariners under his command were renowned for their boldness. According to the 10th-century account of al- Mas'udi (The Meadows of Gold, VIII, 74‚Äì75) a Greek convert to Islam reported to him that Yazaman was among the ten illustrious Muslims whose portraits were displayed in some Byzantine churches in recognition of their valour.

Built in Germany just before World War II, it was intended as a record breaker and duly set a new world out-and-return distance record in 1938. Design and development The Akademische Fliegergruppe of the Technical University of Darmstadt (Akaflieg Darmstadt) was first formed in 1921. It was, and is, a group of aeronautical students who design and construct aircraft as part of their studies and with the help and encouragement of their University. Before the Cirrus their sailplanes designs, whilst often advanced, had all been constructed from wood and fabric. It was well known that high performance required large lift to drag ratios, and that these were obtained by using high aspect ratio wings. The 20 m (65 ft 7 in) span wings of the Cirrus had an aspect ratio of 33.6, the highest of any aircraft built at the time, and such slender structures could not be built entirely from wood. Instead, a single, wide, tapering duralumin spar was built up out of corrugated sheets, with upper and lower skins that formed about one third of each wing surface at the root and more at the tip. Ahead and aft of the spar the wing profile was shaped with wooden ribs and plywood skinned. It was straight tapered in plan, constructed from an inner 10 m (32 ft 10 in) centre section and two outer panels each 5 m (16 ft 5 in) long, with a high taper ratio of 4 and with squared off tips. Strongly tapered wings have a lift distribution which falls rapidly along the span, so the angle of incidence of the wings of the Cirrus initially increased along the span (wash-in), then decreased towards the tips (wash-out), producing a better approximation of the lift distribution to that of the aerodynamically ideal elliptical wing. The outer panels had ailerons along the whole of their trailing edges, and the inner section similarly carried flaps. The ailerons were of the differential type and were interconnected to the rudder to simplify yaw correction. Mid- chord spoilers were fitted on the centre section. Apart from its span and aspect ratio, the wing had two other unusual features. A combination of the then new NACA profiles used gave the wing more camber at the tip. Since higher camber airfoils stall at greater angles of attack measured from the zero-lift line, the combination of higher camber and washout means that the stall develops inboard and that the ailerons, on the unstalled outer wing, retain lateral control and can prevent entry into a spin. This is now a standard sailplane design feature but was new in the 1930s. The other unusual and possibly unique wing feature was that the dihedral of the outer panels (there was none inboard) could be varied in flight though large angles (+8.5/-4.4). The intention was to investigate the effects of outer wing dihedral on handling. The wing was set on top of the forward fuselage or pod, which ended just aft of the trailing edge. The pilot's seat was ahead of the leading edge, with a canopy that ran back into the wing. The canopy and part of the surrounding upper fuselage was removed for access. There was a shallow landing skid under most of the pod. Take-offs were made from a four-wheeled dolly, left behind after launch. A slender, light magnesium alloy (electron metal) tube ran aft from the top of the pod, carrying the empennage, which had ply covered fixed surfaces and fabric covered control surfaces. The horizontal surfaces, set forward of the fin were straight tapered with rounded tips; the fin, which extended above and below the boom carried a large, almost semi- circular rudder. Operational history The Cirrus, flown by Bernard Flinsch, set a new world record out and return distance in 1938, flying 306 km (190 mi) from Bremen to L√ºbeck and back. Damaged in a launch accident, it was rebuilt with a revised pod and redesignated the D-30B. In June 1939 Flinsch flew it 406 km (252 mi). The Cirrus did not survive World War II.

Photographic and artistic circles of the world attributed Marko Modic a special place because of his unique and colorful works of art.  Biography  In 1976 he got his first camera Praktica from his father. At the beginning he worked in black and white photographs and later embarked on a more complex photo-montage that he uses also in his work today. Photograph is used occasionally as a basis on which then he draws a picture. In his work are photographs, paintings, books, as well as performances. Modic's enigmatic photographic works show an extreme sensibility towards perception and use of colors. He captures details of everyday objects or places and uncommonly presents them in insolation, neither in a content nor in perspective-evoking ambiguous interpretation and curiosity... In 1988 Marko Modic won \\"Zlata ptica\\" [\\"Golden Bird\\"], a Slovenian award for extraordinary achievements in the fields of cultural creation. Marko Modic has exhibited his photographs widely at home, in Italy, Ecuador, Argentina, UK, Canada... In 2011 he had an exhibition \\"Written on skin of the Earth\\" in Tivoli Park in Ljubljana, Slovenia and in Whyte Museum of the Canadian Rockies, Banff, Canada. At the end of 70's and in the early 80's he was an active member of Ljubljana Cave Exploration Society (DZRJL), took part in high mountain deep cave exploration, was the editor of the society's journal Glas podzemlja [Voice of the Underground] and contributed to design and contents of other caving publications.

In response, Hatami traveled to Tabriz, Azerbaijan, and played a significant role in the creation of an army for the Democrat Party. After the Democrat Party was defeated, he escaped the country and went to the Soviet Union. From 1947 to 1974, he was a member of the Science Academy for the Socialist Republic of Azerbaijan. After the Iranian Revolution, he returned to Iran and continued his writings as a member of the Central Committee of the Tudeh Party of Iran. The Tudeh Party had been created in 1941. The Tudeh's ideology was Marxist‚ÄìLeninist, and it supported policies of the former Soviet Union. The Party had played a major role in Iran's political scene until it was banned for the second time following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Tudeh Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists, and actively supported the new government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of government attacks in 1982, and most of the Party's leaders and members were imprisoned.  Arrest and detention  The circumstances of Hatami's arrest and detention are not known.  Trial  According to the book The Tudeh Martyrs, Mr. Hatami was tried and condemned to life imprisonment. No information about the trial, or the retrials that led to the executions, has become available. The relatives of the political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In an open letter to then-Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi in 1988, they argued that the official secrecy surrounding these executions was proof of their illegality. They noted that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they either were serving or had completed when they were retried and sentenced to death.  Charges  No charge was ever levelled publicly against Hatami. In their letters to the Minister of Justice in 1988, and to the U.N. Special Rapporteur visiting Iran in February 2003, the families of the victims stated that authorities' accusations against the prisoners had included being \\"counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti- Islam,\\" as well as being \\"associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders.\\" An edict by Ayatollah Khomeini - reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor - corroborated these claims. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini referred to the members of the People's Mujahedin of Iran (PMOI) as \\"hypocrites\\" who do not believe in Islam and \\"wage war against God.\\" He also decreed that prisoners who still approved of the PMOI's positions were also \\"waging war against God\\" and should be sentenced to death.  Evidence of guilt  The report of his execution contains no evidence provided against Hatami.  Defence  In their open letter, the families of the prisoners stated that the defendants were not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that prisoners were associated with guerrillas operating near the borders, the families submitted the isolation of their relatives from the outside during their detention: \\"Our children lived in most difficult conditions. Visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider through a telephone every two weeks. We witnessed, over the past seven years, that they were denied access to anything that would have allowed them to establish contacts outside their prisons' walls.\\" Under such conditions, the families argued, it would be impossible for these prisoners to engage with political groups outside Iran, as the authorities claimed.  Death No specific information is available about Hatami's death sentence. He was hanged in September 1988, at age 74.

The main changes from 1635-1666 were commissioned by confraternity of St Joseph, and elevated the nave, and constructed a presbytery, dome, and chapel dedicated to the named saint. The nave ceiling is frescoed with episodes of the Infancy of Jesus and the Life of St. Joseph, painted by Giovanni Maria Conti, called della Camera, and his assistants Francesco Reti and Antonio Lombardi. The altar has wooden polychrome statues of the Holy Family carved by Angelo Fontana and of the saints Apollonia and Lucia, by Giovanni Battista Merano.

It is used to make the release of the bowstring quicker and reducing the amount of torque put onto the bowstring from the archer's fingers. Use Archers using compound bows most commonly use a release aid to hold the string and release it precisely, although finger tabs are also popular with compound bows, especially among older archers who have used finger tabs when shooting recurve bows. The release aid attaches to the bowstring just below the nocking point or at the D loop and permits the archer to release the string by the use of some form of trigger. When such a device was first invented (patent filed in USA, 1879) it was known as a \\"clutch\\".Elmer R.P. Target Archery 1952 page 297 The trigger may be an actual trigger lever which is depressed by a finger or thumb (positive), or held and then released (negative); there are numerous types. Hydraulic and mechanical time delay triggers have been used, as have \\"back tension\\" triggers which are operated by either a change in the position of the release or \\"true back tension\\"; the release triggers when a pre-determined draw weight is reached. A mechanical release permits a single point of contact on the string instead of three fingers as most commonly used with finger tabs. This allows less deformity in the string at full draw, as well as providing a more consistent release. This is primarily because the most successful types operate with positive pressure, whereas the conventional 'fingers' release is negative pressure. Some archers prefer three fingers under the arrow with a finger tab, whereas the split-finger approach, having one finger above the arrow and two fingers below the arrow is the most commonly used finger shooting method amongst English and modern North American archers, who do not use mechanical release aids. The mechanical release retains the string by a gate or loop of cord. The gate or cord is released by operation of the trigger, allowing the string to push open the gate or cord. Consequently, any sideways movement of the string, and hence arrow nock, is likely to be less than if fingers were used, although, if a consistent finger tab release is performed, the differences are often negligible in terms of practical hunting accuracy at ranges up to 30 yards. Advantages The first advantage of using a release aid is the drastic decrease in chance of dry firing a compound bow. Doing this runs the risk of damaging the bow, and can result in the injury of the user. Using a release aid can also make it easier to group arrows tighter together, due to a consistent release that is put on the bowstring every time, rather than using finger muscles to hold back the weight of the bow, which makes the release of the bowstring harder to replicate consistently. This is true not only under high pressure situations, but also in any regular practice. If used with a wrist strap, the release allows one to pull the draw weight of the bow with the arm muscles instead of all the tension being put on the fingers. Lastly, many modern compound bows are designed to be shot using a release aid. They are designed with solid limb stops and fine planes of motion. This increases the chance of the bow string \\"jumping\\" off the cams if a release aid is not used. Disadvantages As any mechanical device, it can and will break eventually. An archer who does not have an extra release may end up shooting with his fingers, which changes draw length and accuracy. Release styles Wrist triggers are the most popular releases, used mostly by hunters and casual recreational shooters. These are the easiest releases to use because of the familiarity most people have with pulling a trigger. These releases consist of a thick wrist band and a rod with the mechanism at the end of it. They are popular with hunters mainly because the wristband lessens the chance of it falling from a tree stand. T-handled releases are hand-held releases that rely on the strength of one's fingers. The release is held in the fist, with the mechanism usually poking out between index and middle finger. A handled release uses one of two different styles of a mechanism either by using a back tension or a thumb switch. These styles of releases are most popular with tournament archers and sometimes in tree stands. Release mechanisms Caliper style releases are most popular with the wrist trigger style of releases, due to the fact that the trigger mechanism near the head of the release makes it simple to actuate the caliper open and closed in an efficient manner. With only one or a few moving parts, this release is simple and dependable. Thumb switch release aids are the most complicated, with the most moving parts of the three most common releases. They work on the depression of a thumb switch that is mounted to a T-handle's style of release. The attraction to these release aids are that they are a good midpoint between a caliper and back tension style of release aids, making the transition from one to the other a little smoother over a longer period of time. Back tension release aids are the simplest mechanically, with only one moving part. However, as a result of this, they are the hardest style of release to learn how to use. The aid relies on the muscle tension through the forearms and back in order to release the latch at the end of the T-handle's leg. These releases are known for their accuracy and dependability on the tournament archery scene. They depend on the fulcrum of a lever over a half-moon-shaped piece of metal in order for the release to go off. Release attachment A D loop is the most popular way of attaching your release to the bowstring because it causes the least amount of torque on the bowstring itself. It consists of a small-diameter piece of nylon cord tied to the string of the bow, using two reverse facing half hitch knots. It is named for the resulting \\"D\\" shape. Under nock is when one directly attaches the release to the bowstring under the bottom of the nock of the arrow. This is popular with older archers who have not yet adopted the D loop. This style of attachment puts the most amount of stress not only on the bow but also on the arrow itself on top on the release mechanism. Alternatives In Arab archery as in Central Asia and the Middle East, thumb rings are used for string retention and release. The arrow must be positioned on the other side of the bow (on the right hand side of the bow for a right-handed shooter) to properly use a thumb ring, to allow the arrow to flex properly, since the thumb opens in the opposite direction to the fingers.Elmer, R. P. (1952). Target Archery. pp. 345‚Äì349. The choice of a mechanical release aid versus a finger tab must be accounted for in a compound bow's tuning and sighting, as finger-released arrows will group in a different spot when using a mechanical release aid versus a finger tab. Likewise, the choice of arrow rest for a compound bow depends on whether a finger release archery tab or mechanical release aid is used. For a finger-released arrow, a plunger pin is most commonly used as the arrow rest, to impart a tuned impulse laterally to the arrow at the moment of release to improve point-of-impact groupings. In contrast, for a release aid configuration, a Whisker-biscuit arrow rest is very commonly used with a compound bow.

Stabilisers help reduce inconsistencies of the archer's release by increasing the moment of inertia of the bow.Charles E. Phelps Archery Stabilizers ‚Äì Theory and Practice 2006 If the shooting technique of the archer were perfect, no stabilisers would be required. Precision comes from repeatability. The reduction of inadvertent movements enhances repeatability. The various types of stabilisers are each designed to minimise a particular direction of movement. These movements are those that may occur between the instant of true aim/string release, and the arrow flying free: not \\"follow- through\\" and similar activities, which merely indicate what went before. All weight added to the centre section will reduce trembling or shake during the aim, but energy to hold the bow against gravity will obviously increase. Also, the addition of weight will change the shooting characteristics and matching of the arrows to the bow. The successful addition of stabilisers can only be achieved by actual testing and precise groupings. All bodies have inertia, and it is static inertia and non-static inertia that bow-weights \\"use\\", which means that they resist movement. Consequently, on the application of any force on the bow, e.g. (1) muscular force, whether voluntary or involuntary: (2) the reaction of the bow to the acceleration of the bow limbs, string and arrow: (3) the further reaction of the bow as the string becomes taut and the arrow flies free: the actual physical movement of the bow centre section will be less with the addition of weights than it would have been without. Clearly, the forces acting on the centre section are potentially the same on any shot, and by increasing the static inertia, movement will be reduced. Poker stabiliser A bow with long-rod and reverse stabilisers A long-rod stabiliser holds a weight in front of the bow. It is usually fitted into the centre section in line with the bow arm, or just below the hand position. The addition of this weight moves the centre of gravity of the bow forwards, with two results. First, \\"torque\\" effect (sideways twisting of the bow-hand) movement is reduced. At full draw, the string prevents the bow from twisting, but on release, the bow can turn sideways to some degree, directing the arrow to the left or right.Elmer R.P., Target Archery, 1952 But with the forward centre of gravity, the effect is reduced. Similarly, \\"topping\\" (upwards) or \\"heeling\\" (downwards) inconsistencies of the bow-hand are reduced. Second, with actual movement of the bow-hand sideways, up, down, or any combination, because the centre of gravity is in front of the hand, the bow will turn in the opposite direction, to correct, to some degree, the archer's error. There is also an effect that does not actually give enhanced accuracy or precision, but there are times when this can still be helpful except in the mind of the archer: the pleasing \\"forward roll\\" of the bow, as part of the follow-through, with a relaxed bow-hand and forward centre of gravity. Twin or limb stabilisers Fitted above and below the bow-hand, normally close to where the limbs meet the centre section, these have similar effects to the single long- rod, but also have a third effect. Because of their positioning, the twin weights also resist rotation instigated by a bow-hand error. If this error were not reduced, left or right shots would occur, because the aiming of the arrow takes gravity into account to gauge the trajectory. Consequently, with perfect aim, if the bow rotates on release, the effect will be the same as not holding the bow vertically, i.e. left or right. Similarly to the long-rod, a \\"forward roll\\" will be induced on release and, in addition, because the twin stabilisers are positioned at the base of the limbs, depending on the rigidity of the mounts, some vibration may be damped, giving a smoother feel to the shot. Reverse or counterbalance stabilisers Fitted usually below the bow- hand on the centre section, because they point back towards the archer, they bring the Center of Gravity backwards. Consequently, they are typically used in conjunction with a long-rod stabiliser, the long-rod having sufficient turning moment to exceed the negative effect of the reverse weights, and so keep the forward roll of the bow on release, this being generally accepted as a desirable feature. Hence, the forward centre of gravity effect will not be as great, but, because the reverse weight or weights are extended horizontally from the vertical centre section, their effect is to reduce vertical turning caused by bow-hand torque. This is, of course, in addition to any long-rod stabiliser anti-torque effect. Use and summary Consider the bow as being potentially on a pivot at the pressure point of the bow-hand. If the archer applies inadvertent pressure off centre of the pressure point, then inadvertent movement of the bow will result, with loss of precision. By careful study of the bow's movement, the appropriate positioning and addition of weight(s) may be tried, to reduce errors, although prevention is better than cure. Further, various types of mount have been used, to allow some degree of flexure between the bow and the stabiliser weight. Similarly, the weight may be on an extension rod that may flex in itself. The object of the exercise should be kept in mind, and that object is to reduce bow inadvertent movement. Any flexure will allow some movement of the bow, without similar movement of the weight, hence lessening the weight inertia. However, many archers have found an apparent improvement in their precision with the use of flex / mounts. The weight in hand remains unchanged, and so may contribute to steadiness of aim. Also, the flexing gives a \\"rubbery\\" feeling, as though the bow wants to remain steady on aim. Consequently, it may be that such effect helps the archer's feeling of confidence on the shot, thereby contributing to precision.

Gifford's work was largely for humour strips in British comics, often for L. Miller & Son. He was a highly influential comics historian, particularly of British comics from the 19th century to the 1940s. Gifford was also a committed comic collector of British and US comics, and owned what has been called the \\"world's largest collection of British comics.\\" Comics art and scriptwriting: Marvelman titles Gifford wrote, drew and often created a wide selection of back-up strips that featured in a number of the Marvelman titles, usually one-page humour strips, as well as the Marvelman Family strip in its own title. Gifford used a variety of pen-names for the work, including Belteshazzar Oakworm, Clubtwee Gleeb and 'Fred Granule Bepp'., Joe King, Jack Upp and Belle Tupp. These humour strips may have been reprinted across a number of titles in the L. Miller & Son stable. * Young Joey; in Marvelman #185, #188 (1957), #300 (c. 1960), #341 (Sept 1960) #368 (Dec 1962) and others; L.

Most notable was probably his co- creation with Bob Monkhouse of the superhero Streamline and the Streamline Comics title, but his short-lived Ally Sloper title was a significant if unsuccessful attempt to blend nostalgia for British comics with the more adult approach of the Modern Age to reach new audiences. Gifford and Monkhouse also combined to form Streamline Publications, specialising mostly in reprints of US comics and pulp novels. * Streamline; Streamline Comics #1 (1947); Cardal Publishing - co-creator/art/cover art/script * Terry Traylor (cover); Streamline Comics #2 (1947); Cardal Publishing - co-creator/cover art * Bully Beef; Streamline Comics (issue unknown) (1947); Cardal Publishing - creator/art * Super Worm; Streamline Comics (issue unknown) (1947); Cardal Publishing - creator/art * Search for the Secret City (repr. in Black Tower Gold Collection vol. 3); Streamline Comics #4 (1947); Cardal Publishing - art/script * Inky the Imp of the Inkpot; Streamline Comics #4 (1947); Cardal Publishing - creator/art/script * Panto Pranks; Panto Pranks #1 (of 1) (1949); Hotspur Publishing -creator/art/script * Little Red Riding Hood and the Hungry Wolf; Panto Pranks #1 (of 1) (1949); Hotspur Publishing - creator/art/script * Cinders and her Sour Sisters; Panto Pranks #1 (of 1) (1949); Hotspur Publishing - creator/art/script * The Klever Kids; Panto Pranks #1 (of 1) (1949); Hotspur Publishing - creator/art/script * Jest and Lest; Panto Pranks #1 (of 1) (1949); Hotspur Publishing - creator/art/script * Raddled Riddles and Red Riding Hood 'Dot to Dot'; Panto Pranks #1 (of 1) (1949); Hotspur Publishing - creator/art/script * Panto Pranks Playtime; Panto Pranks #1 (of 1) (1949); Hotspur Publishing - creator/art/script * Simple Simon Christmas Crackers; Panto Pranks #1 (of 1) (1949); Hotspur Publishing - creator/art/script * Puss in Boots; Panto Pranks #1 (of 1) (1949); Hotspur Publishing - creator/art/script * Various strips; Panto Pranks #1 (of 1) (1949); Hotspur Publishing - creator/art/script * Fizz Comics #1 (of 1) (April 1949); Modern Fiction - script/editor * Tiger-Man; Ray Regan #1 (of 1) (April 1949); Modern Fiction - creator/art/script/editor * Various strips; Ray Regan #1 (of 1) (April 1949); Modern Fiction - script/editor [25] * Tobor the Great; Star Comics #1‚Äì2 (1954); D Publications - script (art by James Bleach) * Jill Day; Star Comics (unknown issue) (1954); D Publications - script/ art * Various strips; Star Comics #1‚Äì2 (1954); D Publications - ed./art * Various strips; Ally Sloper #1‚Äì4 (of 4) (1976); Alan Class Publishing - editor * Political Fun; Ally Sloper #2 (1976); Alan Class Publishing - script (art by Terry Wakefield) * Various strips; Comics 101 #1 (of 1) (1976); Convention souvenir comic - art * Sheerluck Jones, Super Sleuth; Melvin's Money Fun #1‚Äì2 (Sept 1981‚Äì1982); Department for National Savings - creator/art/script * Koo- koo Korner; Melvin's Money Fun #1 (and #2?)

It was first awarded in 1948 in several fields of art. Since 1971, it has been awarded by the Academy of Arts (Akademie der K√ºnste) on behalf of the Senate of Berlin. Annually one of its six sections, fine arts, architecture, music, literature, performing arts and film and media arts, gives the great prize, endowed with ‚Ç¨15,000, whereas the other five sections annually award prizes endowed with ‚Ç¨5,000. History The Berlin Art Prize has been awarded since 1948 in commemoration of the March Revolution of 1848. The official name then, Berliner Kunstpreis ‚Äì Jubil√§umsstiftung 1848/1948 (Berlin Art Prize - 1848/1948 Jubilee Foundation), was used until 1969, the ceremony was held by the Mayor in the Charlottenburg Palace. The prize was planned to be awarded first on 18 March 1948 by the City Berlinale, to commemorate the March Revolution and the revolutionaries who fell for a new state (f√ºr einen neuen Staat gefallenen Revolution√§re). The first prize winners of 1948, shortly before the currency reform, who received awards of 10,000 Mark, were the sculptor Ren√©e Sintenis and the composers Ernst Pepping and Wolfgang Fortner. The then-Senator of Education awarded the prize without consulting a jury. In 1949 a constitution was drafted. The prize (per section DM 3,000.00) should be awarded annually for achievements in literature, music, painting, graphic and performing arts. As a result, changes were made regarding the divisions, the division between several winners and the award criteria. From the mid-1950s, the ceremony was always accompanied by criticism. Since 1971, the prize is awarded by the Academy of Arts. The Academy awards the prize annually in alternating intervals of its six sections in the order of fine arts, architecture, music, literature, performing arts and film and media arts. The Arts Award for \\"Film and Media Arts\\" award since 1984 and from 1956 to 1983, there were instead the Arts Award for \\"Radio- Television-Film.\\" The prize, awarded every six years by the literature section was named in 2010 the Fontane Prize.

She moved to the University of Chicago where she completed a Master of Arts in socio-cultural anthropology in August 1999. She was awarded her Ph.D in socio-cultural anthropology for her dissertation The Social Construction of Freedom in Free and Open Source Software: Hackers, Ethics, and the Liberal Tradition in 2005. Academic career Coleman held positions including a postdoctoral fellowship at the Center for Cultural Analysis, Rutgers University and the Izaak Walton Killam Memorial Postdoctoral Fellowship, Program in Science, Technology & Society, University of Alberta before being appointed assistant professor of media, culture and communication at New York University in September 2007. During 2010-2011, Coleman spent some time working at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton as the recipient of the \\"2010‚Äì11 Ginny and Robert Loughlin Founders' Circle Member in the School of Social Science\\". In January 2012, she moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada to take up the Wolfe Chair in Scientific & Technological Literacy at McGill University. The same year, she also spoke at Webstock 2012 in Wellington, New Zealand.Gabriella Coleman Speakers Webstock 2012 ‚Äî 13th-17th February 2012 Study of Anonymous Coleman's work on Anonymous has led to her becoming a regular media commentator in addition to her academic publications. In July 2010, Coleman made reference to the Anonymous \\"project\\" or \\"operation\\" Chanology against the Church of Scientology and uses what would become a central motif in her descriptions of the group, the \\"trickster archetype\\", which she argues is \\"often not being a very clean and savory character, but perhaps vital for social renewal\\". Coleman states that she had \\"been thinking about the linkages between the trickster and hackers\\" for \\"a few years\\" before a stay in hospital led her to read Trickster Makes This World: Mischief, Myth, and Art by Lewis Hyde: Coleman's theory concerning Anonymous (and associated groups such as 4chan) as the trickster has moved from academia to the mainstream media. Recent references include the three- part series on Anonymous in Wired magazine and the New York Times. Coleman has also been critical of some of the mainstream coverage of Anonymous. In Is it a Crime? The Transgressive Politics of Hacking in Anonymous (with Michael Ralph), Coleman responds to an article on the group by Joseph Menn in the Financial Times noting: Our Weirdness Is Free: The logic of Anonymous ‚Äî online army, agent of chaos, and seeker of justice, Triple Canopy 2012 January, is Coleman's first major piece of length on the group and draws from a range of observations of those she describes as \\"everything and nothing at once\\". Even Coleman admits she does not fully understand Anonymous, she told the BBC: Coleman's multi-year ethnographic research on Anonymous culminated in the publication of Hacker Hoaxer Whistleblower Spy: The Many Faces of Anonymous. Awarded the American Anthropological Association's Diane Forsythe prize and described by Alan Moore, the co-author of V for Vendetta as ‚Äúbrilliantly lucid‚Äù, the book charts the history, rise, and impact of the Anonymous movement. Even though the book deploys journalistic writing conventions, Coleman continues to analytically frame the activity of trolling and Anonymous in terms of tricksterism. She argues in her book that tricksters ‚Äúare well positioned to impart lessons‚Äîregardless of their intent.‚Äù. And continues to note: > ‚ÄúTheir actions need not be accepted, much less endorsed, to extract positive > value. We may see them as edifying us with liberating or terrifying > perspectives, symptomatic of underlying problems that deserve scrutiny, > functioning as a positive force toward renewal, or as distorting and > confusing shadows.‚Äù The white nationalist troll weev, also treated as a foil to Anonymous, is presented as an example of the terrifying side of trickstermism, while Anonymous, argues Coleman, represents a more positive side, a force for political hope and renewal. The issues of tricksters, trolls and Anonymous was further explored by a group of anthropologists in special issue of the Journal Hau that reviewed Coleman's book.

Career Mills was a trainee at Port Vale and was also at Leek Town as a youth player. He joined Newcastle Town in July 2007, turning down a deal with Leek and in September 2008 joined former club Leek, initially on loan. However, the decision by Newcastle to take Mills off contract to enable him to play for Leek backfired on the club, after the player decided to remain with Leek and sign with them. In March 2009 he turned down moves to Stafford Rangers and to Tamworth and Hednesford Town. opting to remain with Leek for the remainder of the season. In July did sign for Stafford, with an opportunity to play at two steps higher in the football pyramid. He then spent time with Alfreton Town before returning for a second spell at Stafford Rangers. In the 2011/12 season he played for Nantwich Town, including featuring for the club in their 6‚Äì0 defeat by MK Dons in the FA Cup in November 2011. He moved to Macclesfield Town in January 2012 and made his Football League debut on 14 January in a League Two game against Torquay. In August 2012 he joined Chester on loan, scoring nine goals in the seven appearances he made for the club during his loan spell, including a hat-trick in a 4‚Äì0 victory over Guiseley. Whilst Mills was keen to join Chester if the right deal could be made Macclesfield initially rejected Chester's offer but then indicated they would be willing to accept their bid, however Chester manager Neil Young chose not to continue negotiations due to a tight transfer budget. After his return from loan he made his first appearance for Macclesfield in the Conference National in October 2012. In November 2012, with a lack of first team football, Mills transferred back to Chester on a permanent basis, despite being reluctant on a move to part-time football 2 months earlier. The move was funded by donations from Chester fans. Struggling with injuries and form he was loaned to Altrincham, scoring once in four games. He sustained an injury which ended his season. He returned to Chester for the start of the 2013‚Äì14 season but only managed to score once within eleven appearances and left the club in October 2013. After spells with Brackley Town, Leek Town and Newcastle Town he signed for Witton Albion in August 2015.

It dates to 1767, when it was called the Hamburger Gewerbeschule; later it became known as Landeskunstschule Hamburg. The main building, located in the Uhlenhorst quarter of Hamburg-Nord borough, was designed by architect Fritz Schumacher, and built between 1911 and 1913. In 1970, it was accredited as an artistic-scientific university. History The Hamburger Gewerbeschule (Hamburg Vocational School) was founded in 1767 by the Patriotische Gesellschaft (Patriotic Society). It was named the Staatliche Kunstgewerbeschule in 1896, later the Landeskunstschule (State School of Art). Fritz Schumacher designed the main building especially for the art school. Located at Am Lerchenfeld 2 in Uhlenhorst, a quarter of Hamburg-Nord, it was built between 1911 and 1913. After World War II, it re-opened as the Landeskunstschule by Friedrich Ahlers-Hestermann, who had previously been a professor at the K√∂lner Werkschulen (Cologne Academy of Fine Arts). He was succeeded by architect Gustav Hassenpflug, who changed the institution to the Hochschule f√ºr bildende K√ºnste Hamburg. The school was accredited as a university in 1970. Introduction of tuition sparks protest In July 2007, a scandal occurred when the university administration under Martin K√∂ttering came under political pressure to expel students for having protested newly introduced tuition fees.

It was built on the hill whose name was Balez. The settlement originated in Roman times. During Byzantine rule over the area, it was part of the Dyrrhachium theme. Later it was a seat of a ≈æupa of the Kingdom of Duklja, and later still of the Lordship of Zeta. Baleƒç suffered much damage during the Second Scutari War between the Serbian Despotate and the Republic of Venice. After the Republic of Venice gained control over it at the beginning of the 15th century, its size was reduced to a small pronoia with only 25 houses, and the fortress was abandoned and fell to ruin. Skanderbeg's forces rebuilt the fortress during his war with Venice in 1448 and established a strong garrison in it, but the Venetian forces soon drove them away and demolished the fortress. Ottoman plans to rebuild Baleƒç and populate it with Turkish settlers were never implemented and Baleƒç remained in ruins, which can still be seen today.  Bal≈°iƒái family name  Some authors derive the name of the Bal≈°iƒá noble family () from the name of this town. Alternative names for this family include Balesium, Balezza, Balezum, Balezo and Barizi. According to another opinion, the root of the Bal≈°iƒá anthroponym (which emerged in its actual form in 1455) is the name of village Balovc near Podujevo, derived from Balin Potok.  History   Roman Empire  Ancient Roman road from Skodra to Doclea, and position of medieval Balec It is thought that Balec comes from Illyrian, and might be connected with the Albanian word \\"ball√´\\". The first who came to this conclusion was Milan Sufflay. Baleƒç was built on the site of a former settlement of the Roman period, that was destroyed by Avars and Slavs. Its fortress has a Roman origin. Baleƒç was near the road that led from Shkod√´r to Duklja and Onogo≈°t (modern day Nik≈°iƒá), near several important settlements and water resources.  Duklja and Zeta  Baleƒç was part of Byzantine Dyrrhachium until the Kingdom of Duklja, under Stefan Vojislav (1018‚Äì1043), captured it and made it the capital of the ≈æupa of Barezi. According to the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, after the death of Stefan Vojislav in 1044 control over Baleƒç and the Barezi ≈æupa was inherited by his son Mihailo I Vojislavljeviƒá. In the 14th century, control over the region, including Baleƒç, passed to the Lordship of Zeta, ruled by the Bal≈°iƒá family.  Venetian Republic  At the beginning of the 15th century, the Venetian Republic took control of Baleƒç, which became a pronoia, whose pronoiarios (the person to whom the pronoia was granted) lay under obligation to recognize the rights of the bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Balecium, if were to return and claim them. Radiƒç Humoj, a member of Humoj family, was appointed by the governor of Scutari as pronoier over Baleƒç in period 1402‚Äî1403, which was confirmed by decision of Venetian Senate on 16 September 1404. Venetian census of 1417 shows that Baleƒç pronoia was directly subordinated to the governor of Scutari and had 25 houses. After Radiƒç's death, the Venetian governor of Scutari gave the Baleƒç pronoia to Radiƒá's brother Andrija (who was then voivoda of the area north of the Shkod√´r) and his son Kojƒçin. Decision of Scutari's governor was confirmed by Venetian Senate on 13 February 1419.  Rebuilding and destruction of the fortress during Skanderbeg's rebellion  Position of Baleƒç in 1448 In December 1447 Skanderbeg began his war against Venice and besieged Dagnum. When he realised that his siege was unsuccessful he ordered the rebuilding of the fortress of Baleƒç, which was unoccupied and in ruins. The main purpose of placing a garrison at Baleƒç was to cut the supply routes to besieged Dagnum and to gain control over the lands around Shkod√´r. The 2,000 soldiers of the Baleƒç garrison were under the command of Skanderbeg's nephew Hamza Kastrioti and Marin Spani, but Kastrioti was ordered to attack Drivast, leaving Spani in sole command. Marin found the newly rebuilt fortress insecure and, when his relative Peter Spani informed him that a large Venetian force was heading there, he immediately retreated with his soldiers to Danj. The Venetian forces retook the fortress, burned the wooden parts and demolished the rebuilt walls. Andrija and Kojƒçin Humoj, together with Simeon Vulkata, led the pro-Venetian alliance against Skanderbeg, fighting particularly fiercely for control over Baleƒç and Drivast in 1447. Although the Baleƒç area was under firm Venetian control since the beginning of the 15th century, Baleƒç slowly became impoverished and had ceased to exist as a town long before 1448, when the rebuilt fortress was destroyed by the Venetians and the town was already only a memory.  Aftermath  At the beginning of 1474 the whole region around Shkod√´r, including the abandoned Baleƒç, came under Ottoman rule. According to some sources the Ottoman sultan had intentions to rebuild Podgorica and Baleƒç in 1474 and to settle them with 5,000 Turkish families in order to establish an additional obstacle for cooperation of Crnojeviƒá's Zeta and besieged Venetian Shkod√´r. However the plans about Balec were not realized and later Marin Barleti described Balec as ruins.  Religion  :For (Latin) ecclesiastical history see Roman Catholic Diocese of Balecium There were many Orthodox churches in Baleƒç and surrounding villages. There are records about an Orthodox monastery in the village Kupinik () almost completely populated by Slavs, which owned a mill on the river Rioli near Baleƒç. There are ruins of two churches in Baleƒç with their altars orientated toward East. In 1879 Russian consul Ivan Stepanoviƒç Jastrebov, published his notes about his visit to Shkod√´r, which also included visit to ruins of Baleƒç. Jastrebov described the ruins of two Orthodox churches in Baleƒç, whose ruins belonged to the territory of Rioli tribe. He explained that the first church was a cathedral with dimensions of 25 times 10 steps, and a narthex with dimensions 17 times 10 steps. Jastrebov described another church on the southern side of Baleƒç as smaller and built in the same stile as cathedral. At the beginning of the 14th century, Baleƒç was the seat of a small Catholic diocese. In 1356, Bishop Andreas Citer complained that his bishopric was full of schismatics. The diocese had been laid waste and impoverished by \\"the schismatics of the kingdom of Rascia\\", who had completely destroyed the monastery situated 5000 paces from the cathedral. In response, Pope Innocent VI granted him in commendam, on 26 September of the same year, the Benedictine monastery of St. John in Drivast..Wissenschaftliche Mitteilungen aus Bosnien und der Hercegowina, Volume 10 (1907), p. 6. Quote: ... welches Kloster als \\"ab regni Rasciae schismaticis quasi totaliter dissipatum\\" bezeichnet wird; die Verleihung dieser Pfr√ºnde erfolgte, weil die Di√∂zese von Balecium von den Schismatikern verw√ºstet worden und verarmt war.

One of many film variations of Daniel Defoe's 1719 novel Robinson Crusoe, it features a female castaway. Plot On September 28, 1659, a ship founders. The captain's daughter and cabin boy, Robin Crusoe (Amanda Blake), and a sailor named Sykes reach a deserted island. When Sykes tries to force Robin to show her appreciation for his efforts, she flees up a hill. In the ensuing struggle, he falls over a cliff and is killed. She soon settles in, building herself a tree house. When a group of savages shows up with two women captives, she watches from hiding as they execute one in gruesome fashion. She then rescues the other (Rosalind Hayes), and the two fight off the men with the aid of her flintlock. She names her new companion Friday, as that was the day of her rescue. The two women become friends. In December, Royal Navy officer Jonathan (George Nader) washes ashore. Robin's experiences with lecherous sailors and her cruel father have embittered her against men, and she is hostile and suspicious at first. When Jonathan learns that she is repairing a longboat that can hold only two, he suggests that the \\"fittest\\" take it, and send help back for Friday. Robin, however, insists she and Friday will use the boat. Eventually, Robin overcomes her prejudice against him, and they spend the night together. The next morning, she awakens to find he has stolen the longboat and is sailing away. When he returns, she assumes he is a coward, and sets out to kill him. He informs her that he turned back for her. Before she can shoot him, however, the savages return and capture Friday. Robin and Jonathan rescue her, but are surrounded. When all seems lost, Robin admits she wants to marry Jonathan. Just then, a warship appears and bombards the attackers, enabling the trio to steal an outrigger canoe and reach the safety of the ship. Cast * Amanda Blake as Miss Robin Crusoe * George Nader as Jonathan * Rosalind Hayes as Friday Production Miss Robin Crusoe had the working title \\"Miss Robinson Crusoe\\". When producer Eugene Franke attempted to register that title with the Motion Picture Registration Bureau, there were objections raised by √ìscar Danciger, who had recently completed a film called Robinson Crusoe in Mexico, and M-G-M, which was planning a film to be called \\"Robinson Crusoe\\" starring Spencer Tracy. The MPRB decided in September 1953 that Franke could use either \\"Miss Robin Crusoe\\" or \\"Miss Robinson Crusoe\\". Danciger re-titled his film Adventures of Robinson Crusoe. The director originally slated to helm the film was E. A Dupont. Production of the film - which was shot in Path√©color - ended October 14, 1952 at Samuel Goldwyn Studios. Location shooting took place in Palos Verdes, California, in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.LoBianco, Lorraine \\"Miss Robin Crusoe (1953)\\" Turner Classic Movies Although Miss Robin Crusoe was a low-budget film, its score is by the noted film composer Elmer Bernstein, who, like many others in Hollywood during the witch hunt for Communists by the House Un- American Activities Committee, found it hard to get work. Bernstein had not been blacklisted, but had been what he referred to as \\"graylisted\\", saying \\"I wasn't one of the big wheels of the Communist Party or anything, but I'd done enough left-wing things that between about 1953 and 1955, the major studios would have been very loathe to employ me.\\" Bernstein was forced to take work that he would not have previously accepted, such as this film, as well as others such as Robot Monster and Cat-Women of the Moon.O'Toole, Finton (October 28, 1990) \\"Elmer Bernstein Finds Himself in Tune With Movies\\" The New York Times Critical response The film was not well received. Critic Win Fanning wrote in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: \\"As it is quite impossible to believe that a number of grown men and women could seriously go about the making of a movie called Miss Robin Crusoe, it must be assumed some sort of joke is intended. It isn't a very good joke, but it has its moments of hilarity.\\" References  External links    Category:1954 films Category:American adventure drama films Category:American films Category:Films based on Robinson Crusoe Category:Films about survivors of seafaring accidents or incidents Category:1950s adventure films Category:20th Century Fox films ","title":"Miss Robin Crusoe"},{"id":"34456332","title":"Should've Known Better (Soluna Samay song)"},{"id":"34456334","title":"La La Love"},{"id":"34456453","text":"The New Bongaigaon‚ÄìGuwahati section of the Barauni‚ÄìGuwahati line connects New Bongagaon and Guwahati in the Indian state of Assam. History Early developments within Assam The Assam Railway and Trading Company played a pioneering role in laying railway tracks in Assam. The first railway line in Assam, 15 miles long, was laid in 1882 between Amolapatty, Dibrugarh and Dinjam Stream for transportation of tea. It was extended up to Makum collieries at Margherita in 1884. The company also established the first passenger railway ‚Äì Dibru Sadiya Railway. Assam links pre-independence During British rule, rail links from Assam to the rest of India were through the eastern part of Bengal. In pre-independence days, there were basically two linkages. On the western side, a metre gauge line running via Radhikapur, Biral, Parbatipur, Tista, Gitaldaha and Golokganj connected Fakiragram in Assam with Katihar in Bihar. On the eastern side, Assam was linked to Chittagong through the Akhaura‚ÄìKulaura‚ÄìChhatak line and Akhaura‚ÄìLaksam‚ÄìChittagong line. Assam was linked to numerous other towns in the eastern part of Bengal through what is now the Mahisasan-Shahbajpur defunct transit point. The eastern line had been constructed in response to the demand of the Assam tea planters for a railway link to Chittagong port. Assam Bengal Railway started construction of a railway track on the eastern side of Bengal in 1891. A track between Chittagong and Comilla was opened to traffic in 1895. The Comilla-Akhaura-Kulaura-Badarpur section was opened in 1896-1898 and finally extended to Lumding in 1903. The Assam Bengal Railway constructed a branch line to Guwahati, connecting the city to the eastern line in 1900. During the 1900-1910 period, the Eastern Bengal Railway built the Golakganj-Amingaon branch line, thus connecting the western bank of the Brahmaputra to the western line. Apart from the eastern and western lines, there was another link. In 1908, Eastern Bengal Railway extended the Kaunia‚ÄìDharlla line to Amingaon. Assam Link Project With the partition of India in 1947, all the three links were lost and for a short period the railway system in Assam was delinked from the rest of India. Indian Railways took up the Assam Link Project in 1948 to build a rail link between Fakiragram and Kishanganj. Fakiragram was connected to the Indian railway system in 1950 through the Indian portion of North Bengal with a metre-gauge track. The New Bongaigaon‚ÄìGuwahati section was converted to broad gauge. Broad gauge reached Guwahati in 1984. Saraighat Bridge The construction of the 1.49 km long Saraighat Bridge, the first rail-cum-road bridge across the Brahmaputra, was an event of great excitement. Jawaharlal Nehru, India‚Äôs first prime minister formally laid the foundation stone on 10 January 1960 and it was completed in 1962, connecting the two parts of the metre gauge railways in Assam. Siliguri-Jogihopa-Kamakhya line The long wide broad gauge Siliguri- Jogihopa line was constructed between 1963 and 1965. The Naranarayan Setu was constructed in 1998, thereby paving the way for linking Jogihopa with Kamakhya.  Dudhnoi-Mendipathar branch line  The line between Dudhnoi in Assam and Deepa in Meghalaya was proposed in the Rail budget of 1992‚Äì93. Later the alignment was changed to Dudhnoi-Mendipathar in 2007 due to opposition of local people. Due to late handover of land to railways in Assam and Meghalaya, the progress of work was slow up to 2013. Acquisition of land was completed by March 2013. This rail line is the first foray of Indian Railways into Meghalaya. Mendipathar railway station was inaugurated by the Prime minister of India, Narendra Modi on 30 November 2014, through a video feed to the ceremony gathering at Mendipathar. Electrification Electrification of the entire Katihar‚ÄìGuwahati route is planned to be executed by 2014.

History To commemorate the 250th anniversary of Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) in 1920, founded in 1670 and then an undisputed leader of the international fur trade, the company decided to bookmark and document its 250 years of journey as part of written history, gramophone recording, and as a feature film. To make the promotional feature film, advertising the company's working history and commercial land holdings in Canada's North, HBC hired two cameramen from New York City and sent them on board HBC's ice-breaker. This 'silent' film later became known as The Romance of the Far Fur Country.Background to The Romance of the Far Fur Country The film crew sailed from Montreal to Arctic circle. As reported in a BBC article, in the next course of nine months, they captured extraordinary footage never done before. They captured more than 75,000 feet of film equivalent to 8 hours of viewing time. It is reported that the crew filmed the documentary by walking laboriously on land, across the ice, and traveling by dogsled over a frozen river. The crew filmed from canoes on the Abitibi river and had to portage canoes over their shoulders. The film was premiered in Allen theatre at Winnipeg on May 23, 1920. It was later released across western Canada and in London. Memorable scenes As reported by the BBC, the documentary portrays scenes never shown before. In one scene, an Inuit man named 'Inqmilayuk' talks with the captain of the RMS Nascopie (which carried supplies bound for Arctic fur trade posts), Edmund Mack, with titles reading \\"I was but a youth when I learned to hunt, as my fathers did before me.\\" In another scene, Inqmilayuk's romantic partner 'Innotseak' is introduced with titles: \\"She told me that she loved me.\\" And in the final scene, Inqmilayuk and Innotseak are shown walking into the horizon as lovebirds. In words of Peter Geller, a Canadian visual historian, these scenes places the Romance of the Far Fur Country in the context of the history of documentary films. The narrative and filmic techniques used in HBC's film were later employed by Robert J. Flaherty, who made the commercially successful Nanook of the North and is hailed as father of documentary films by John Grierson.

The octopus's colour is yellowish or reddish-orange to reddish-brown dorsally with diffuse rust-brown patches, and white on the underside. The skin is covered with very fine, closely set granulations, interspersed with larger warts. The relatively short arms have a single series of suckers on them and at rest are held with the tips lightly curled, hence the species's common name.Wilson, Emily (2008) \\"Eledone cirrhosa. Curled octopus\\". Marine Life Information Network: Biology and Sensitivity Key Information Sub-programme. Plymouth: Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom. Retrieved 24/01/2012 This species maximum weight is in the more southerly parts of its distribution and in the northern part. Oral and ventral view Habitat and distribution The curled octopus is mainly found at depths between and may occur down to . It lives in the northeast Atlantic Ocean, including the English Channel, the North Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea. In recent years the North Sea populations have increased, probably due to overfishing of large predatory fish such as Atlantic cod. This has had a knock on effect on crab and lobster fisheries as the curled octopus readily enters pots to take the bait or the catch. In seas of Scotland, E. cirrhosa is infrequently caught when trawling over rocky substrates and are more frequently captured when fishing over sandy or muddy substrates. A survey using different methods found that Eledone cirrhosa was common and widespread throughout the Scottish inshore waters covered by fishing activity, from the shoreline down to 140m, on substrates ranging through rocky, stoney, sandy and muddy. Specimens were caught throughout the year but is most common in inshore waters during the summer months and moves further offshore to the trawling grounds in October‚ÄìDecember. Diet The curled octopus feeds on crabs and other large crustaceans, as well as fish. Serological analysis of the crop of specimens sampled in the Moray Firth and Sound of Jura revealed the main prey to be Liocarcinus spp, Nephrops norvegicus, Cancer pagurus , Crangon crangon and Carcinus maenas, although a large proportion of the samples analysed did not react in the tests suggesting they had consumed alternative prey. It is cited as a significant predator of such commercially important species as Homarus gammarus (European lobster), Nephrops norvegicus (Norway lobster), and Cancer pagurus (edible crab) from traps. When preying on crabs, it immobilises the crab by injecting toxins into the body of the crab through a hole created in its shell using the octopus's radula. The octopus then injects saliva into the crab and the digestive enzymes contained in that saliva break down the crab's internal attachments to its shell, allowing the octopus to easily remove the carapace. Biology The growth rate of the curled octopus is quite rapid and its life span is generally short at 1‚Äì5 years, although there may be some variation between warmer and colder areas. The curled octopus matures at around 1 year (on reaching a total length of for females, slightly smaller for males) and with 1,000‚Äì5,000 eggs laid on average. The females normally attain sexual maturity when they reach a body size of between 400‚Äì1000 g but some females weighing up to 1000‚Äì1200 g show no evidence of enlargement of the ovaries. The males reach just over 600g and typically have well-developed reproductive organs from around 200g. It breeds at a lower rate than the partially sympatric Octopus vulgaris (common octopus). Populations are apparently at their lowest density in the autumn, probably due to post-spawning die off as reproduction involves females laying eggs, guarding them and dying once the eggs hatch. Curled octopuses are solitary animals, generally inhabiting depths of less than , and more common in shallow water, but they have been found down to . Breeding activity of the curled octopus peaks between July and September and there are many juveniles present in October. In 2017 Storm Brian was followed by reports of many curled octopus on beaches and rock pools around the island of Anglesey and the Llyn Peninsula in north Wales. These were mostly juveniles which with their weaker suction than the adults were more affected by waves created by the storm, swept away from their hiding places among the rocks and stranded. Analysis carried out on the stomach contents of stranded Risso‚Äôs dolphins demonstrates that the most important species fed on in Scottish waters is the curled octopus. Fisheries The curled octopus is taken as bycatch in trawl fisheries for other species. It is also captured in earthenware pots in the Mediterranean, although the fishery for curled octopuses is less important than that of the common octopus. International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) catch data for both the curled octopus and common octopus, from all ICES regions (NE Atlantic) in 2006, indicated around 8,999 tonnes, but more recent estimates indicate a substantial increase to around 19,000 tonnes in 2008 (ICES WGCEPH, 2010). Nearly all landings of both species within these regions are taken by Portugal and Spain, with Spain taking the vast majority, although most of these will be of the common octopus. Curled octopus at Fish online Neither species is subject to either stock assessment or quota controls in Europe and in the case of the curled octopus there is no minimum size for landing. In the Adriatic this species is caught and sold alongside Eledone moschata but is the less numerous of the two. It is not regarded as a commercially viable species in Scotland and any caught are normally discarded. right References External links * Curled octopus Category:Cephalopods described in 1798 Category:Marine molluscs of Europe Category:European Cephalopods ","title":"Curled octopus"},{"id":"34456632","text":"Mae Tam may refer to several places in Thailand: * Mae Tam, Chiang Rai *Mae Tam, Phayao ","title":"Mae Tam"},{"id":"34456635","text":"Encouraging or assisting a crime is itself a crime in English law, by virtue of the Serious Crime Act 2007. It is one of the inchoate offences of English law. Definition Inchoate means \\"just begun\\" or \\"undeveloped\\", and is used in English criminal law to refer to situations where, although a substantial offence has not been committed, the defendant has taken steps to commit it, or encouraged others to do so.Herring (2008). p. 771. As in all inchoate offences, the defendant \\"has not himself performed the actus reus but is sufficiently close to doing so, or persuading others to do so, for the law to find it appropriate to punish him\\".Herring (2008). p. 772. Actus reus The offences of encouraging or assisting crime under the Serious Crime Act 2007 are inchoate offences.Ormerod, David. Smith and Hogan's Criminal Law. Thirteenth Edition. Oxford University Press. 2011. p. 402. In each case, the actus reus requirement is that the defendant carry out an act capable of \\"encouraging or assisting\\" the commission of another offence. An offence is committed under section 44, if this is done with intent to do the same; under section 45 if it is done \\"believing that the offence will be committed and that the act will encourage or assist its commission\\"; or under section 46 where there are multiple possible offences being encouraged or assisted, and at least one is foreseen.Simester et al. (2010). p. 287. In contrast to statutory crimes still reliant on incitement, there is no need for the defendant to have communicated his thoughts to anyone else. For example, the act is when a letter is posted; it is not reliant on it being received by the person being incited. Since this is very wide, the courts will have to narrow it by some criterion, probably by reference to the remoteness of the encouragement to the crime. Failing to act when under a duty to do so would also qualify.Simester et al. (2010). p. 291. \\"Encouraging\\" is not defined in the statute and can be considered in the same way as the previous crime of incitement. It does not matter if the encouragement or assistance has no effect.Simester et al. (2010). p. 288. In Invicta Plastics Ltd v Clare,[1976] RTR 251 (DC) a company sold a device to detect radar traps used by the police; using such a device is illegal. The case also confirmed that there is no need for the incitement to be aimed at a specific person ‚Äì addressing it to the world at large still constitutes incitement.Herring (2008). p. 793. It was advertised illustrating its use in an illegal fashion.Simester et al. (2010) p. 289. However, in R v. James(1985) 82 Crim LR 897 (CA) the selling of \\"black boxes\\" solely capable of illegally tapping mains electricity sources was not found to incite a crime. In R v. Marlow[1997] Crim LR 897 (CA) providing information on the growing of cannabis was found to constitute an offence. \\"Assisting\\" is likely to be considered similar to \\"aiding\\" in accessorial liability. Assistance can be provided indirectly, for example through a third person.Simester et al. (2010). p. 290. Whereas incitement can only be committed when the defendant incites the principal offender, the crime of \\"encouraging or assisting\\" includes helping an accessory.Simester et al. (2010). p. 292. Whilst a section 44 offence can be committed in relation to other inchoate offences (including itself), sections 45 and 46 cannot. Crimes which are, in fact rather than law, impossible to commit yet - but will be - also fall under this offence.Simester et al. (2010). p. 293. Mens rea In terms of mens rea, any form of recklessness, including virtual certainty, is insufficient for an offence under Section 44, in part due to the existence of Section 45 and 46 which aid its interpretation. Offences under Sections 45 and 46 are only committed if the defendant believes that both the crime will be committed, and that the act will encourage or assist the offender: that they might do so is not enough.Simester et al. (2010.) p. 294. However, it is also possible to commit these offences if the defendant commits an act capable of encouraging or assisting the commission of a crime, intending or believing that the principal offender would carry out the \\"act\\", where that may not in itself constitute a crime. However, it is necessary that the defendant intend or be reckless to any required circumstances or consequences - for example, that death was a result. Additionally, the prosecution must show that the defendant believed that (or was reckless as to) whether the act would be done with the required mens rea, or that the defendant himself has the required mens rea for the offence.Simester et al. (2010). p. 295. These amount to very complex provisions.Simester et al. (2010). p. 296. Specific defences There is no defence of later withdrawing from the act; however, there is one of \\"acting reasonably\\" under Section 50. This takes two forms: either that the acts themselves were reasonable; or that the defendant reasonably believed in circumstances which did not exist and acted reasonably under those circumstances. The existence of this defence has been attacked by Andrew Simester and Bob Sullivan on the grounds it may be acting as a \\"sop\\" to counteract excess brevity in other sections of the act.Simester et al. (2010). p. 298-99. Victims are extended the \\"Tyrell\\" defence - that one cannot aid, abet, counsel or procure an offence against oneself - although exactly when a victim is protected can be unclear.Simester et al. (2010). p. 299-300.

P. Robson) (1808 - 1870) was a Tyneside poet and writer of the 19th century. His most famous works are The Pitman‚Äôs Happy Times and \\"The Pawnshop Bleezin‚Äô\\" a comic description of the reactions of the various customers to the pawnshop going up in flames. He was a contemporary of other Geordie songwriters like George \\"Geordie\\" Ridley and Joe Wilson.  Early life  Joseph Philip Robson was born 24 September 1808 in Bailiffgate, Newcastle upon Tyne. His father was preparing for priesthood at Stonyhurst College when he suffered ill health, resulting in his inability to complete his training, and he became a Roman Catholic School teacher. Both of his parents died when he was very young, his mother when he was 6 and his father 2 years later, when he was only 8. J P Robson himself was apprenticed as a plane maker, but severely injured himself while lifting a heavy log. He was well educated and changed career directions, becoming, like his father, a schoolmaster. He took to poetry at an early age and had his first works published in 1831.  Marriage  He was married on 21 September 1830 at St Andrew Church, Newcastle upon Tyne to Isabella Stobbs. (Isabella was born in 1811 in Newcastle, and had worked as a Plain Sewer. She died in the early months of 1875 in Newcastle upon Tyne, aged 65). They had one daughter and three sons.  Later life  He became a celebrated poet and a friend of many prominent poets of the day. He was persuaded by two of his musical friends to start writing in the dialect, which he did, with great success. He received a commission from Prince Louis Lucien Bonaparte (1813-1891), to create a version of the Song of Solomon in the Tyneside dialect. In 1849-50 he moved on to editing, being involved in the book of \\"The Bards of the Tyne\\" which was a collection of local songs, including some of his own songs. In 1854 he left Newcastle and settled in Sunderland, where he assisted in the compilation of a shipping register. He later returned to Newcastle. After the publication of \\"Hermione\\" in 1857 he received,(through Lord Palmerston), a grant of ¬£20 from the Civil List. Towards the summer of 1869 while arranging for the publication of \\"Evangeline\\" he had a stroke. Although he did improve, this eventually led to his death. He died on 26 August 1870 in Clayton Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, aged 62 and was buried in Jesmond Old Cemetery, Newcastle upon Tyne.
