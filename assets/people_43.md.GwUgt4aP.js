It is a dependency of Vatopedi Monastery and is the site of the Athonias Ecclesiastical Academy. The Skete of Saint Andrew in Karyes, Mount Athos History The Skete (a smaller, dependent monastic house) had its origins when Patriarch Athanasius II of Constantinople retired to Mount Athos in the mid fifteenth century after the Fall of Constantinople and settled in a Monastic House on the site of the old Monastery of Xistrou that was dedicated to St. Anthony the Great. A brief history of Saint Andrew‚Äôs Skete This house later became the foundation of the Skete. In 1761, Patriarch Seraphim II of Constantinople also retired to Mount Athos and replaced the old house with a new building that he dedicated to the Apostle Andrew as well as St. Anthony. In 1841 Seraphim's house was given by the Monastery of Vatopaidion to two Russian monks, Bessarion and Barsanouphios. Initially known as the Cell of St. Anthony, in 1842, the monastics, under the sponsorship of Tsar Nicolas I of Russia, began expanding their residence. With its expansion, Patriarch Anthimus IV of Constantinople recognized the St. Anthony Cell as a Skete in 1849. The Skete was called that way because the customs and statute of Mount Athos precludes the establishment of new monasteries besides those of the Byzantine era. With the continued growth of the Skete in monastic numbers, a central church, dedicated to Saint Andrew, was built in 1867 and consecrated in 1900 by Patriarch Joachim III of Constantinople. The church is the largest on Mount Athos and is amongst the largest in the Balkans. =Twentieth century= As the twentieth century began the Skete had grown greatly. Prior to World War I the population of the Skete included 700 to 800 Russian monks. The Skete of Saint Andrew Anthony Bulatovich One of these monks, Hieromonk Anthony Bulatovich, was regarded as the main proponent of the Imiaslavie doctrine, a dogmatic doctrine which asserts that the Name of God is God Himself. The doctrine was condemned by the Russian Orthodox Church in 1913, Bulatovich published a few books on the subject. In January 1913 a monk called David, a supporter of imiaslavie, was elected as the hegumen of the skete, taking the place of the monk Hieronim who was an opponent of it. Hieronim did not recognize the results of the elections and complained to the Russian Embassy in Greece. The Imperial Government insisted on changing the hegumen back to Hieronim. In June 1913 a small Russian fleet, consisting of the gunboat Donets and the transport ships Tsar and Kherson, delivered the archbishop of Vologda, Nikon (Rozhdestvensky), and a number of troops to Mount Athos. The archbishop visited both St. Panteleimon Monastery and the Skete of Saint Andrew, where he tried to convince supporters of imiaslavie to change their beliefs voluntarily, but was unsuccessful. On July 31 the troops stormed the St. Panteleimon Monastery. Although the monks were not armed and did not actively resist, the troops showed very heavy- handed tactics. They set up two machine guns and a number of water cannons, and the soldiers were ordered to beat the monks with their bayonets and rifle butts. Allegedly, four monks were killed and at least forty-eight were wounded. After the storming of St. Panteleimon Monastery the monks from the Skete of Saint Andrew surrendered voluntarily. The military transport Kherson was converted into a prison ship. It took 628 monks to Russia and on July 9 set sail to Odessa. Forty monks were left in the Mount Athos hospital, judged unable to survive the transportation. On July 14 the steamship Chikhachev delivered another 212 monks from Mount Athos. The rest of the monks signed papers that they rejected the imiaslavie. After interrogation in Odessa, 8 imprisoned monks were returned to Athos, 40 were put into jail, and the rest were defrocked and exiled to different areas of the Russian Empire according to their propiska. Bulatovich was sent to his family estate in the village Lebedinka of Kharkov gubernia, to where many imiaslavtsy moved. This, and the further events of World War I and its aftermath, brought disastrous results as the potential for monks from Russia disappeared. In 1958, the western wing of the Skete and library were destroyed by fire and, in 1971, the last monk of the old community died. The community became deserted. In 1992 a new, Greek- speaking brotherhood brought new life to the Skete. In 2001, young monks joined in community and deal with the preservation of the icons and the maintenance of the premises.

After studying English and philosophy at California State University, Chico (BA, 1970), Couzens moved to Oakland, where she worked at a law school, explored San Francisco's bohemian scene, and took classes at California College of Arts and Crafts; an early work was part of the Crocker-Kingsley competition at the Crocker Art Museum in 1972. After moving to Sacramento in 1977, Couzens studied art at City College, California State University, Sacramento (MA, 1987) and University of California (UC), Davis (MFA, 1990), where she worked with Robert Arneson, Squeak Carnwath, Manuel Neri, Cornelia Schulz, and Wayne Thiebaud.Belt, Debra, \\"Breathing Space,\\" Sacramento Bee, September 6, 1992. p. 9, 13. Her studies were interrupted by an accident in 1989 that forced a long recovery in a wheelchair and crutches and shifted her art from large abstractions using unconventional materials to small charcoal drawings she could do in her lap. They led to her first mature work, atmospheric charcoal drawings that fused abstraction and figuration. During and after graduate studies, Couzens drew attention for her art in shows at the Christopher Grimes (Santa Monica), Jeremy Stone (San Francisco) and Michael Himovitz (Sacramento) galleries; the Oakland Museum and Yale University also acquired works.Kandel, Susan, \\"Psychological Space: Julia Couzens,\\" Los Angeles Times, December 16, 1993.

The intricate whorls and linear patterns of the lace suggested webs, nests, veins and fingerprints, leading her work to attend more to natural forces beyond the body and cultural issues involving domesticity and power.

Their assortment of visual reference points‚Äîspider webs, seaweed, dense underbrush, crochet, networks‚Äîsignaled a departure from distinct objects to more ambiguous, shifting matrices of nature and culture unraveling, ensnaring or conjoining that emphasized fragility, ephemerality and tenuousness.Muchnic, Suzanne. \\"Fancies,\\" The Davis Enterprise, November 6, 2003.

Board of Education, the \\"mother of all impact litigation\\". Impact litigation or strategic litigation is the practice of bringing lawsuits intended to effect societal change. Impact litigation cases may be class action lawsuits or individual claims with broader significance, and may rely on statutory law arguments or on constitutional claims. Such litigation has been widely and successfully used to influence public policy, especially by left-leaning groups, and often attracts significant media attention. History In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the American Civil Liberties Union and National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (at times though its Legal Defense Fund) both pursued legal action to advance and protect civil rights in the United States. The ACLU followed a primarily \\"defensive\\" strategy, fighting individual violations of rights when they were identified. The NAACP, in contrast, developed a more coordinated plan to actively file suits to challenge discrimination, known as \\"affirmative\\" or \\"strategic\\" litigation. The NAACP's model became the pattern for \\"impact litigation\\" strategies, which applied similar tactics in contexts other than racial discrimination. Important early impact litigation cases included Brown v. Board of Education and Roe v. Wade. Brown, a 1954 U.S. school desegregation decision, was carefully prepared by Thurgood Marshall and other NAACP lawyers so that the eventual Supreme Court ruling invalidated official racial discrimination throughout the U.S. government. Many cases since then have closely imitated it, in the course of seeking greater protections for other disadvantaged groups. Scope Impact litigation has played a major role in the development of American desegregation, abortion, tobacco regulation policy and gay marriage. Since the 1980s, impact litigation has been used to seek the reform of U.S. child welfare law, following earlier work which involved the courts in jail and mental hospital reforms, and in school desegregation. Strategic impact litigation, among other things, has also been used in Nigeria to push for convictions of perpetrators of police brutality and to defeat legal attacks on the freedom of the press. In a few jurisdictions where attorneys are prohibited from bringing class action lawsuits, citizens have filed \\"grassroots impact litigation\\" cases and successfully represented their own claims. Debate Impact litigation has been criticized by legal scholars and politicians on the bases of judicial legitimacy and competence. The legitimacy argument holds that, in countries with a constitutional separation of powers, societal changes are to be enacted by democratically elected bodies and are outside the purview of individual judges. The competence argument claims that institutional limitations on the amount and quality of information that can be made available in a court proceeding make the courts poorly prepared to handle complex policy issues. Another version of this argument points out that courts are limited in the scope of their responses, relative to legislative bodies. These debates overlap with those concerning so-called \\"judicial activism\\".

It was first published in 1963 in the inaugural issue of The Classic, a South African literary journal founded by Nat Nakasa and Nadine Gordimer. On publication, the story was banned by the apartheid regime. \\"The Suit\\" was adapted for the stage by Mothobi Mutloatse and Barney Simon in 1994, and has been adapted into a short film of the same name, written and directed by Jarryd Coetsee and premiered in 2016. The story  The story takes places in Sophiatown, a township of Johannesburg, in the early 1950s, shortly before the apartheid regime forcibly removed non-whites from the area to make way for white resettlement under the Group Areas Act and the Natives Resettlement Act, 1954. Philemon, a doting husband who works for a lawyer, prepares breakfast in bed for his beautiful wife, Matilda whom he calls Tilly. He does this every day, taking deep pleasure in serving his wife rather than the whites whom he is obliged to serve under apartheid. Every morning is much the same: he readies himself, cooks and wakes Matilda, who refuses to let him wait around to clean up after her. Philemon and Matilda share a communal lavatory with thirty other people who live in a backyard slum which was typical in Sophiatown. Once dressed, Philemon leaves to catch his bus. This morning, Philemon meets up with his friend, old Mr. Maphikela, in town. Maphikela reluctantly informs Philemon that Matilda has been visited by a young man every morning for the last three months. Devastated, Philemon takes the bus back to Sophiatown and discovers Matilda in bed with her young lover. Philemon pretends not to acknowledge the discovery and scratches through the cupboard, telling Matilda that he was almost at work when he realised that he had left his pass at home and thus returned to fetch it. Matilda‚Äôs lover leaps out of the window and flees naked down the street ‚Äî leaving his suit draped over a chair. Philemon regards the suit and tells Matilda that he notices that they have a visitor. Philemon commands Matlida to treat the suit with the same hospitality that she would show to a guest: it will share meals with them, it will share their bedroom, it will go for walks with them, etc. If she refuses, he says that he will kill her. For the first time in his life, Philemon goes to a shebeen (an illegal speakeasy), where he stays all day, leaving Matilda alone with her thoughts and fears. When Philemon returns, he finds that Matilda has cleaned and spruced up their dingy home. She even wears a beautiful new dress and has prepared dinner. Unmoved, Philemon scolds his wife: where is their visitor? Matilda retrieves the suit and prepares a plate of food for it. This is how it should be from now on, Philemon tells her. Time passes, and Matilda‚Äôs continued punishment wears on her. Desperate for an escape, she joins a cultural club organized by the local Anglican Mission at the Church of Christ the King in Ray Street (incidentally the same street in which the writer Can Themba lived at Number 111). She finds catharsis among the other married women in the club. She invites her new friends to come to her home the following Sunday. She spends the entire week preparing for the party. Just before Matilda serves the meal, Philemon orders her to bring out the party‚Äôs guest of honor: the suit. As her guests chitter about this odd behavior, Matilda begs her husband to put her punishment on hold, but he refuses. After she is properly embarrassed, Philemon goes with her friends to a shebeen. When he returns home, he is devastated to find Matilda curled up with the suit, dead. Adaptations  \\"The Suit\\" has been adapted for the stage and film. =Theatre= South African writer and publisher Mothobi Mutloatse and playwright Barney Simon adapted the story into a play by the same name, first presenting it in November of 1994 at Johannesburg‚Äôs Market Theatre. Marie- H√©l√®ne Estienne and Peter Brook presented their French translation/adaptation of the play, Le costume, at Th√©√¢tre des Bouffes du Nord in Paris in 1999; the production toured the world.

Beardsworth, Luke (5 August 2016)Everything You Need To Know. Lai gained his wealth through his position as general manager and shareholder of Palm Eco-Town Development Company, which he developed from a small plant nursery business into China's largest landscape development and construction firm over his two decade long stewardship. Following his departure from Palm Lai has focused on private investment, but remains heavily connected to the company and serves as a director of a number of its subsidiaries.

A largely elusive figure, little is known publicly known about Lai, however according to a report by the Birmingham Post a conservative estimate of his total wealth put the figure at ¬£2.8 billion. Lai resides in Guangzhou, a city in the Guangdong province of China, and only attends West Bromwich Albion club matches occasionally, leaving the day to day running of the club in the hands of long term associates Li Piyue who serves as the club's chairman, and Ke Xu who is the club's Chief Executive Officer.Brown, Graeme (26 January 2017). Life and career Lai was born in Meizhou, Guangdong, China in 1974, however almost nothing is known about his childhood. Lai served as General Manager of Palm Eco-Town Development Company Limited for over 20 years. He helped grow the company from a plant nursery into one of China's largest and most successful landscape development and construction companies. Lai stepped down from this role in 2014 to focus on private investment projects, yet retains a close link with Palm and remains director of a number of subsidiaries including Belt Collins International (HK) Limited, Palm Landscape (Hong Kong) Limited, Hangzhou Nanyue Palm Landscape Construction Limited and PALM Design Holding.Express and Star (5 August 2016) West Brom Takeover - Who Is Guochuan Lai? =West Bromwich Albion= In July 2016, Lai agreed to purchase West Bromwich Albion F.C. from Jeremy Peace for a figure reported to be ¬£200m, the deal was completed on 15 September 2016 and lai appointed former Blackburn Rovers chairman John Williams as the new chairman of the club. The Yunyi Guokai (Shanghai) Sports Development Limited group was formed with the purchase of the club in mind, with the groups funding coming from three different sources; the majority of the funds equating to 59% of the total were provided by Lai himself, 23% of the funds were provided by Chinese investment group Yunyi Investment and the remaining 18% were provided by Lai's former firm Palm who later acted as the club's shirt sponsor for the 2017-18 season (before this deal prematurely ended with the club's relegation in that season), and are the current sponsors of the club's training ground, which has been renamed the Palm Training Ground. Taylor, Louise (5 August 2016) West Brom Takeover Chinese Investment Group Lai's first season as Albion owner was a largely successful one, with the club managing a 10th place finish and Lai personally endearing himself to fans in the early days of his ownership, through his decision to give every fan at the first home game of the season a free scarf, and every fan travelling to the first away game of the season a free drink Express and Star (5 August 2016) . However the following season was marred by various issues both on and off the field; including opposition from the fans towards the Head Coach Tony Pulis due to the style of football the club exhibited under his leadership and a decline in results, and the failures associated with the tenure of his successor Alan Pardew. Pardew was unable to arrest the slide in results that the club had been experiencing and presided over embarrassing off field controversies, most notably what became known as 'Taxi Gate', when four senior players were alleged to have stolen a taxi during a mid-season training break in Barcelona Express and Star (26 April 2019) , these failures contributed to an overwhelmingly negative season which ultimately culminated in the club's relegation to the Championship. Chairman John Williams, CEO Martin Goodman and Technical Director Nick Hammond were sacked by Lai due to issues relating to transfers in the build up to the 2017-18 season, and their decision to appoint Alan Pardew as manager which proved to be an overwhelming failure. Following relegation to the Championship efforts were made to address longstanding fan opposition towards the style of football the club had become known for in the years before their relegation. Prior to their first season in the Championship club legend Darren Moore who had enjoyed a successful playing career with the club (gaining promotion to the Premier League in the 2001-02 and 2003-04 seasons) was appointed as the club's new Head Coach (following a spell as caretaker manager towards the end of the club's relegation season during which Albion had gone unbeaten, and enjoyed victories over Tottenham Hotspur at the Hawthorns and Manchester United at Old Trafford only narrowly missing out on survival in the Premier League) and Li Piyue an associate of Lai's was appointed Chairman of the club. These decisions were part of the club's desire to re-establish a connection with the fans and establish greater control over proceedings at the club, coming alongside a promise to return to an attacking style of football. However Moore was controversially sacked during the 2018-19 season with the club sitting in 4th place in the Championship table, the club was then led by First Team Coach James Shan for the remainder of the season, with Albion being beaten in the play-off Semi-Finals by rivals Aston Villa.

Three years later she returned with her husband to Germany, where she was involved in the Munich municipality. Grimm and her husband divorced in 1983. On April 1, 1984, she married the widowed German convert Abdulkarim Grimm (1933-2009) and moved to Hamburg with him.R√ºckblick auf ein bewegtes Leben: die IZ im Gespr√§ch mit Fatima Grimm. In: Islamische Zeitung, 27. Juli 2010 (online)http://www.islamische-zeitung.de/?id=13585 online In the following decades, Grimm wrote and translated several books and wrote numerous articles, some of which appeared in the Al-Islam magazine. For several years Grimm was also in charge of the magazine.Lebenslauf Fatima Grimm vom Zentralrat der Muslime in Deutschland e.V., 24. November 2013 (online). As a journalist Grimm devoted herself mainly to issues such as education and the role of women in Islam. A short-lived children's magazine, You and Islam,ZDB-ID 1245133-2) was managed by her. In addition, Grimm worked on a German translation of the Qur'an by a group of mostly women, including Halima Frills and Eva-Maria El- Shabassy.). The group planned a re-translation of the English translation of the Qur'an by Abdullah Yusuf Ali.Ahmad von Denffer (Islamisches Zentrum M√ºnchen): History of the Translation of the Meanings of the Qur‚Äôan in Germany up to the Year 2000.

The translation contained detailed comments from Abdullah Yusuf Ali, Muhammad Asad, al-Qurtubi, Sayyid Qutb, Daryabadi, Ibn Katheer, Mawdudi, al-Suyuti, and Abdul Hameed Siddiqi, that have been adopted and translated directly to comments from Sufis or Shiites.Murad Wilfried Hofmann: German Translations of the Holy Qur'ƒÅn.

She worked for almost 16 years on 24 booklets of Al-Islam and in five volumes in SKD Bavaria, which the publisher of Abdel-Halim Khafagy published. Grimm's translation belongs alongside that of Muhammad Rassoul. Muhammed, who was from Central Council of Muslims in Germany(ZMD), wrote a guide for translating the Qur'an in 1999.Irka-Christin Mohr: Islamischer Religionsunterricht in Europa.

The website of the ZMD, islam.de, called Hamida Behr Grimm's Koran translation, which was accompanied by contemporary comments, her \\"probably greatest legacy.\\" It states that it is the first jointly Sunnis and Shiite- developed Koran translation into German. \\"Islamic scholar not with her work dealt,\\" but \\"in the new departments for Islamic theology\\" says their comments.Fatima Grimm: Ihr Leben kommentiert den Koran ‚Äì Nachruf von Hamida Behr. islam.de, 13.

At his grave, his daughter gave the funeral prayer in the presence of representatives of the Islamic Center Munich(ICM). From April 1999, Grimm was an honorary member of the advisory board of the ZMD.Gremien und Mitglieder des ZMD. Stand: 1999 (online). In addition, she and her husband Abdul KarimLiberal-Islamischer Bund e.V.: Zum Tode unseres Mitglieds Fatima Grimm, 7.

This effort (jihad), can presently be carried out both with the sword and with the feather, with the blade as with a scalpel, or even with a sewing machine or a wooden spoon. Jihad is a struggle against all forces who attack Islam from within and without.

Its world premiere was given by the San Francisco Symphony conducted by Pablo Heras-Casado on April 27, 2016. The piece is dedicated to Larry and Mich√®le Corash. Composition =Background= Auditorium has a duration of approximately 20 minutes. The piece is scored for a small orchestra accompanied by a processed pre-recording of a smaller ensemble performing an original neo-Baroque composition by Bates. In the score program notes, Bates remarked, \\"Auditorium begins with the premise that an orchestra, like a person, can be possessed. The work haunts the San Francisco Symphony with ghostly processed recordings of a Baroque ensemble, with the electronic part consisting entirely of original neo-Baroque music created for the San Francisco Conservatory's Baroque ensemble, conducted by Corey Jamason.\\" He added, \\"Essentially it is a work for two orchestras‚Äîone live, one dead.\\" Bates had only recently taken an interest in Baroque music, about which he said in a pre-premiere interview with the San Francisco Classical Voice, \\"Michael (Tilson Thomas) gave me a list of names to explore. Auditorium rises out of my love for 18th century music, which I'd not delved into until recently.\\" =Instrumentation= The instrumentation of Auditorium consists of two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani, and strings. The instrumentation of the pre-recorded ensemble comprises flauto traverso, Baroque oboe, Baroque bassoon, natural horn, natural trumpet, theorbo, harpsichord, and strings. In accordance with the era, the Baroque ensemble is tuned a half-step lower than the orchestra. Reception Reviewing the world premiere, Joshua Kosman of the San Francisco Chronicle said the piece \\"felt oddly undercooked ‚Äî more like a 15-minute storyboarded mockup than a fully formed creation.\\" He added, \\"Perhaps the biggest disappointment in Auditorium is how little it shares the orchestrational virtuosity of Bates' earlier works, including Alternative Energy and the recent phenomenal Anthology of Fantastic Zoology. Here he seems too busy bouncing back and forth between the two musical modes, old and new, to give either of them the requisite color or sheen.\\" Conversely, Steven Winn of the San Francisco Classical Voice called it \\"ingratiating and good-natured work\\" and wrote, \\"What gave the piece its immediate currency was the conversation he set up between old and new, natural and recorded sound.\\" Winn also noted an enthusiastic response from the audience, remarking, \\"A significant portion of Friday night's audience was on their feet and cheering, summoning Bates and conductor Pablo Heras-Casado out for multiple curtain calls.

Design  The light fixture was designed by J.J.P. Oud as a unique wedding gift for Dutch painter and ceramist Harm Kamerlingh Onnes and his wife Titia Easton. Its asymmetrical, cantilevered design makes it suitable to be used on top of a piano, illuminating the keyboard and sheet music. The fixture consists of a cylindrical metal tube which contains the lamp, attached to a thin shaft mounted on a flat round base. A spherical counterweight at the other side of the shaft provides balance. The sphere is executed in shiny metal, while the rest of the lamp has a matte metal surface. The whole fixture is 10.6 cm high, 19.5 cm wide and 28.5 cm long. With its simple and very functional forms, the lamp looks like a small abstract sculpture. It is inspired by the avant-garde art movement De Stijl, of which Oud was a member till 1922, and by the geometric forms used by the Bauhaus. In this sense, it is slightly related to Gerrit Rietveld's table lamp from 1925, but the fixture designed by Oud is more dramatic in terms of balance and asymmetry.  Manufacturing  For the actual construction of the lamp, Oud turned to the manufacturing firm of Willem Hendrik Gispen. The latter may have provided some creative input in the construction of the lamp, but this is not certain, as no design or construction drawings remain. Gispen may have felt intellectual ownership of the design, as he took the lamp into mass production by his firm in 1928. J.J.P. Oud was not consulted about this and felt indignated, but he did not sue Gispen; both men remained friends. Gispen named the lamp Giso 404. Materials, size and execution of the lamp varied slightly throughout the years and it received different names (Giso 5011 in 1936, Giso 5201 in 1939). The asymmetry of the design was mirrored in 1939 and from that date the lamp also had a push-button switch in its foot.  Reception  Although most Gispen designs were mainly influential and popular in the Netherlands and not so much abroad, the Giso 404 is part of many museum collections worldwide ‚Äì including the MoMA, Cooper Hewitt, Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Dutch Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen and Gemeentemuseum Den Haag.

Sang Chul Lee is a leading taekwondo innovator and missionary and has played an instrumental role in the promotion and development of Taekwondo throughout the United States and the world.Lee, Jay. The 25th Year History of the US Taekwondo Center. Colorado Springs: n.p., 2011. Print. 15-17. He is the longest-tenured US National Taekwondo Team coach, serving from 1979 to 1988. In Taekwondo sparring, Lee is credited with innovating the Ax Kick. During his coaching tenure, he is credited with developing a more versatile fighting stance and developing steps for his athletes to be more fluid in their movements. Lee was the US Olympic Taekwondo Head Coach at the Seoul Olympics in 1988. Although a demonstration sport, the 1988 US Taekwondo Olympic team is the most decorated of any US Taekwondo Olympic team. Lee's athletes won 11 medals, including 3 golds and finished second to the South Korean team, which at the time was the best in the world. Lee has been passionately involved in the promotion of Taekwondo throughout the United States and served as USA Taekwondo (formerly US Taekwondo Union) president from 1997 to 2004. In 1992, Lee established the US Open Taekwondo Championships and founded the US Open Hanmadang in 2009.  Early life  Sang Chul Lee was born in Korea in 1948 and was the youngest of six children. The young Lee grew up in the war-torn Korean town of Mangyeong near Gunsan, which is Southwest of Seoul and not far from the coast of the East China Sea (today there is a US Airforce Base at Gunsan).O'Hare, Michael. Lee Interview. Colorado Springs: USTC, 25 Aug. 2015. MP4. The family lived in a one-room thatched hut at the base of an acre plot where his father scratched out a living as a farmer in the Mangyeong rice fields. In the summer of 1950, when Lee was 2 years old, the North Korean Army invaded South Korea. The Lee family felt the brunt of the civil war. Lee's oldest sister had married a man from the North near the 38th parallel. When the North Korean Army invaded, the Lees lost contact with their daughter. The family never heard from her again. South Korean refugees mid-1950 The family struggled against hunger and starvation, which was pervasive throughout South Korea. The toddler Lee was malnourished and he developed a bad rash, most likely erysipelas, which spread all over his body. The sores bled and would not go away. The Korean doctors tried many types of remedies, to no avail. In desperation, his mother took him to an American M.A.S.H unit stationed nearby. The American doctors gave him penicillin and his rash was cured overnight. This was the first encounter Lee had with the Americans, who would play such a pivotal role in his life.O'Hare, Interview, August 25, 2015. Lee's martial arts training began at age 11, when he joined his first dojang. His school was a style of Taekwondo called Jidokwan, roughly translated to 'the way of wisdom'. Lee's Master was Grand Master Il Sup Chun, whose brother, Sang Sup Chun, had developed this style of martial art in 1946. Unfortunately, like Lee's sister, Sang Sup Chun was kidnapped by the North during the Korean War. However, his brother maintained the school and contributed heavily to the development of modern-day Taekwondo and many of the techniques found in Olympic Taekwondo Sparring.Cole, Alan, trans. \\"The History of the Ji Do Kwon: Interview with Chong Woo Lee.\\" World Taekwondo August (1997): n. pag. Print. The young Lee was quite adept at Jidokwan, earning his black belt within 2 years. He had a reputation as a top martial arts fighter. Like most of the Korean martial artists his age, he had developed a rather cocky attitude as well. This attitude was not tolerated by the older generation. Il Sup Chun admonished Lee and his peers, \\"Overconfidence is no good. You have to learn control.\\" As a youngster, Lee also acquired a nickname, Woosong, due to his good nature and loyalty to his friends. Woo means \\"wants to be friends\\" and Song means \\"evergreen\\" in Korean. Roughly translated, Woosong would be \\"eternally loyal friend.\\"Lee, Jay. The 25th Year History of the US Taekwondo Center. Colorado Springs: n.p., 2011. Print. P. 57 As a teenager, Lee was an imposing figure in the Taekwondo ring. He was tall and lanky, with a chiseled face and determined demeanor. Lee was a fighter. Although he was big for a Korean, Lee fought as a welter and middleweight. Korea in the 1960s was still a poor country. Although the country prided itself on its martial arts prowess, university scholarships were hard to attain. The teenage Lee applied for a scholarship at Korea University. The university accepted him, but since he did not have money to pay the entrance fee, which was around $5,000 at the time, he could not enroll. Lee's future prospects looked bleak. He returned to his family farm to follow in his father's footsteps. Lee's fortunes were about to change. Korea University had a disastrous Taekwondo season, losing almost every match. The university agreed to waive the entrance fee and offered Lee a scholarship again to study law and to participate on its Taekwondo Team. Lee turned the Korea University Team around. In less than a season, the team went from worst to first, leading the team to four straight national championships. Lee's dedication and love of Taekwondo led to his success at the University. He did not have much choice. If the team did not win, he risked losing his scholarship. Without much money, Lee could not go out with his friends and on dates. He spent his time in the dojang from earlier in the morning until late at night. After college, Lee served his mandatory military service in the Marines. He again led his team to national titles. When his competition days ended, Lee coached his Marine's team to additional championships. In 1970, Lee retired undefeated with 13 Korean National Gold medals. Soon thereafter, Lee was inducted into the Korean Sports Hall of Fame.O'Hare, Interview, September 15, 2015. Later in life, Lee would say, \\"Without Taekwondo, I could not be the happy man that I am. I am very proud of what has come to me through Taekwondo. Without it, I would have become a small farmer in a small town in Korea producing milk and rice. Because of Taekwondo, I went to college, got a scholarship, was named athlete of the year, received a Hall of Fame honor and became a national champion.\\"Burke, John. \\"Exclusive Interview with Sang Chul Lee US Olympic Coach.\\" Taekwondo Times November (1988): 62. Print.  Coming to America  In 1975, Lee immigrated with his wife, Soon Lee, to America. The Lees arrived on Staten Island, New York with $800 in their pockets. Lee's first job was as a janitor at a special education school. He also worked part- time as a Taekwondo instructor. Lee came to America with a much bigger vision of introducing and establishing Taekwondo in America. In 1976, Lee purchased a small Taekwondo school inside an abandoned warehouse in Binghamton, NY, opening Sang Lee's Black Belt Academy.Dieffenbach, John. \\"Sang Lee: Master the ART.\\" Pipe Dream Features 10th ser. III.April 6 (1984): 3-5. Print. Running the school was a challenge in and of itself. The school had only 30 students, which was barely enough to cover the business expenses. Across town, Lee faced heavy competition from the popular Karate Master Hidy Ochiai, who owned the biggest Martial Arts school in Binghamton. Lee was undaunted despite his lack of business acumen and his limited English, and decided to employ a Korean Binghamton University student to translate for him. Lee taught every class at his center and provided free classes at the university. Lee's passion, dedication, and mastery of the Taekwondo was infectious. Word spread quickly about his school, and thus successfully grew. Within a couple of years, Lee had over 300 students.O'Hare, Michael. Master Steven Silz-Carson Interview. Colorado Springs: USTC, 6 May 2016. MP4.  Marriage and family  Lee married Soon Lee a month before he came to the United States. Two years later, the Lees had their first of four sons, Young Lee, followed by Won Lee, Jay Lee, and Jung Lee. The Lees instilled in their children the five tenets of Taekwondo: Respect, Integrity, Perseverance, Self Control, and Indomitable Spirit. They also emphasized a strong work ethic. The children were taught to work hard, to achieve beyond their potential, and to give back to the community. Lee was fond of saying, \\"if your opponent does 200 kicks, then you must do 300 kicks. Make no excuses.\\"  U.S. Olympic Taekwondo Head Coach  Sang Chul Lee is the most decorated US Olympic Taekwondo Head coach in history. Although Taekwondo was a demonstration sport at the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games, his US team won 11 medals, including 3 gold, more than any other US Taekwondo Olympic Team.\\"Taekwondo.\\" N.p., n.d. Web. https://www.olympic.org/seoul-1988/taekwondo Lee's coaching success was not easy. In the late 1970s, the US Taekwondo Team was unranked in the world. According to Lee, the team had gone through a series of \\"fake\\" masters who knew Taekwondo, but did not know Taekwondo sparring or how to teach it. Lee's teaching proved instrumental in the U.S. Team's success. Taekwondo athletes traveled from around the country to Binghamton to train under him. Lee was not satisfied with his own teaching. Taekwondo sparring had been somewhat stilted in South Korea in the 1960s. The number of kicks were limited and the movement was back and forth. Lee remarked, \\"In our time we just kicked, we didn‚Äôt move much.\\" Lee heavily influenced reinvigorating Taekwondo sparring, often credited as developing the \\"Ax Kick\\". He wanted more fluidity in the movement of his athletes so Lee visited a local Arthur Murray Dance Studio in Binghamton. Over the course of several months, with the assistance of the dance instructor, a series of steps for his athletes to use in the ring were developed; Chunjin (sliding forward), Whojin (Sliding backwards), Ilbo Chunjin (step forward), Ilbo Whojin (step backwards), and Yeop steps (side steps). With the new steps came a new fighting (kicking) stance. Koreans fought from a static stance, which did not allow for rapid movement. \\"For example,\\" stated Lee, \\"if I kick like [Korean Team], my weight is back, my balance is moved back and if I want to attack again, I must first move my weight forward and then I can kick. This is too slow.\\"O'Hare, Michael. Master Steven Silz-Carson Interview. Colorado Springs: USTC, 6 May 2016. MP4. Lee changed the kicking stance of the US athletes. He shortened the length, lifted the heel of the back foot and distributed more weight on the front foot than the back. This new kicking stance was revolutionary for sparring. A Taekwondo athlete could move much faster forward and backward and to the side. Additionally, the stance had an added advantage of allowing for a quicker and greater variety of kicks, especially spinning kicks, which were becoming more popular in the 1980s. According to Lee: \\"When we competed [Korea in the 1960s], we could make points with our first or second kick. But these days, the athletes are very fast and they kick continuously - now you need to use four and five kick combinations in order to make a point. That is why I emphasize the short, unstable stance in bringing the leg back fast after each kick, so that you can get ready for the next one while keeping your balance forward so that you can kick continuously and quickly.\\"Burke, John. \\"Exclusive Interview with Sang Chul Lee US Olympic Coach.\\" Taekwondo Times November (1988): 63. Print. The US Team responded to these new innovations accordingly, attributing international competition winnings to the transition, and therefore culminating in the growing success at the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games.  Founding the U.S. Taekwondo Center  Shortly after moving to Colorado Springs, Lee founded the US Taekwondo Center. In typical Lee fashion, he spared no expense. He wanted to build a world-class dojang where Olympic athletes could train and where he could showcase Taekwondo to international athletic directors, especially those from Eastern European Bloc countries when they came to visit the US Olympic Training Center. Lee took out a loan of $250,000 backed by Dr. Pejo, the father of three of his students, to purchase the building and do the renovations. Lee charged his Taekwondo disciples, Master Steven Silz Carson, Master Michael Weintraub, and Master David Martin with locating and renovating the new dojang. Lee had three requirements for his new USTC dojang, \\"first, the dojang had to be centrally located. Secondly, it had to be big enough to house several training areas and a weight room. And lastly it had to be close to a McDonald's restaurant because of the profiles and demographics that McDonald's looked for when opening a restaurant were the same.\\"Lee, Jay. The 25th Year History of the US Taekwondo Center. Colorado Springs: n.p., 2011. Print. P.28-29 The first of five USTC dojang locations opened on June 7, 1986 in the heart of Colorado Springs, the USTC Citadel. Lee opened the USTC Lehman Dojang in 1995, the USTC Monument Dojang in 2006, the USTC Briargate Dojang in 2011, and the USTC Stetson Hills Dojang in 2015. The US Taekwondo Center has gained a world renowned reputation and its Hank Logo is recognized in Taekwondo circles around the world.Lee, 27.  Woosong Foundation  As a teenager, Lee was nicknamed Woosong by his friends. In Korean, \\"Woo\\" means \\"friend\\" and song means \\"evergreen\\". Taken together, Woosong translates into \\"ever loyal and faithful friend.\\" Lee felt it appropriate to name his foundation \\"Woosong\\". The Woosong Foundation is a non-profit organization established to provide Taekwondo Scholarships to lower-income families. It is Lee's belief that everyone should have the opportunity to participate in Taekwondo.Lee, 57.  Achievements\\"U.S. Taekwondo Center.\\" Grand Master Sang Lee -. Ed. Jay Lee. USTC, 2012.

Lund.Biographical notes @ the Kunstindeks Danmark. He soon began painting and exhibiting portraits. During the early 1830s, he gained many supporters and admirers in the professional and artistic communities, although his female portraits are generally considered to be too conventional and less interesting; possibly related to shyness due to his youth. He also began to do genre paintings at this time. Many featured his fellow artists as part of the ensembles. He applied for the \\"\\", an arts and sciences fund created by King Frederick V, but the Academy found his drawing skills deficient; advising him to travel and create sketches that could be developed later. As a result, he was given a small travel stipend. Initially, he went with Wilhelm Marstrand and Louis Gurlitt, but later travelled to Munich by himself. After sending several works back home to the Academy, he was awarded money from the fund. Feeling more secure, in 1837 he married Bolette Jacobsen, the daughter of a local merchant. In 1847, he became an \\"Agr√©\\" (a type of member candidate) at the Academy and was promoted to full member the following year. He first won larger public notice with his paintings of troops returning from the First Schleswig War. Other historical works fared well, but his attempts to portray the history of the Jewish community were not successful. In 1859, he was named a \\"Titular Professor\\" and, in 1867, was awarded the \\"\\", a travel scholarship for poets, composers and artists. In 1874, he was appointed Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog. By this time his, eyesight had already declined to the point where painting was difficult. Two years before his death, he received the \\"Dannebrogordenens H√¶derstegn\\".

He is best known for his service as Commanding Officer of The Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire whilst in the Balkans, Chief of Staff of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone, and Director-General of Training Support. Early life and education Duncan was born on 22 October 1952 in Toft Monks, Norfolk, England.Norfolk-born and educated Maj Gen Alastair Duncan dies - Obituaries - Eastern Daily Press Retrieved 2016-10-31. From 1961 to 1970, he was educated at Gresham's School, an independent boarding school in Holt, Norfolk. Military career On 10 March 1973, having attended Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, Duncan was commissioned into The Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire (PWO), British Army, as a second lieutenant with seniority from 8 March 1973. Duncan eventually rose to command the regiment in 1990 as a lieutenant-colonel, and would lead the PWO through two deployments. The first was to Northern Ireland in 1992 to fight in the Troubles, with Duncan appointed an Officer in the Order of the British Empire for his performance in command. The second was in 1993 to Bosnia as part of UNPFOR. It was here that Major-General Duncan was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his leadership in action, with the Telegraph calling him \\"instrumental in the rescue of 200 Croats...\\". After the tour he was commissioned as a commander of the 19th Mechanised Brigade in Germany, and then took up a position in the Ministry of Defence as Director of Land Warfare. In 2000 he was appointed Chief of Staff of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL). UNAMSIL would eventually result in the disarming of more than 75,000 fighters. It rebuilt the country's police force and paved the way to democratic elections. Though stepping down from this position in 2001 to take up his final role in the military as Director-General of Training Support, the United Nations mission was completed in 2005, and Duncan was invested as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his efforts. In 2005, Major-General Duncan retired from the army after 43 years of service. Later life From 2005 to 2009, he was Managing Director of Services Sound and Vision Corporation, a British charity that runs entertainment services for the British Armed Forces including the British Forces Broadcasting Service and the Combined Services Entertainment. In 2013, Duncan was \\"sectioned under the Mental Health Act and confined in a secure mental facility\\". He died on 24 July 2016, aged 63, having suffered a perforated ulcer. Personal life Duncan was married three times and had three children. His first wife was Anita Keily, and together they had two sons; Thomas and Edward. They divorced in 1993. In 1995, he married Avril Walker, and together they had a daughter, Arabella. They divorced in 2008. In September 2013, he married for a third time to Ellen Le Brun, and she survives him. =Health= In 1993, during his posting to Bosnia, Ducan suffered a brain injury when the Warrior tracked armoured vehicle he was travelling in was damaged by a roadside bomb. He subsequently developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in relation to the incident. In 1999, he took mefloquine, an anti-malarial drug, for six months in preparation for his deployment to Sierra Leone. This drug was blamed for his later mental health problems and the worsening of his PTSD.

The actress went through a long casting process, which involved her travelling to Melbourne to audition three times. Months later, she was offered the role. Hazel then relocated to the city from Sydney within three days, so she was available for fittings and filming the following week. Ahead of her first episode, Piper was introduced to viewers in a four-part webisode series called Hey Piper. She made her first appearance in the main show during the episode broadcast on 16 September 2015. Hazel chose to leave her role to pursue further acting opportunities, and her final scenes aired on 3 April 2019. Piper is the youngest child of Brad (Kip Gamblin) and Terese Willis (Rebekah Elmaloglou). Upon her family's arrival in 2013, Piper was often mentioned and said to be living in Canada on an exchange program. Producers held back her introduction to give her parents \\"a second chapter\\" ahead of her siblings' departures. Piper is portrayed as being a typical teenager, who is independent, mature, quick witted and loves technology. Hazel did not find the character much of a challenge to portray, as they are so similar to one another. She was also pleased to be playing a character that teenage viewers would be able to relate to. The character's early storylines revolved around her finding her place within her family, her parents' separation, and her part in a fire at the local high school. Piper has been involved in an on-off relationship with her older neighbour Tyler Brennan (Travis Burns). The pairing has proven popular with viewers, who refer to them by the portmanteau \\"Typer\\". Writers have put several obstacles in the couple's way, including Tyler's casual relationship with Piper's half-sister Paige Smith (Olympia Valance). Other storylines have seen Piper bullied by her English teacher Elly Conway (Jodi Anasta), and have a one-night stand with her friend Angus Beaumont-Hannay (Jai Waetford). Casting The character had often been mentioned and referred to by her on-screen family since their arrival in May 2013, but she did not appear. Piper was said to be living and studying in Canada as part of a school exchange program. Executive producer Jason Herbison explained that Piper's introduction was held back for when her on-screen parents needed \\"a second chapter\\", should her siblings leave the show. Piper's arrival and Mavournee Hazel's casting was announced on 18 August 2015. Of joining the permanent cast, Hazel commented \\"It's a great feeling to be rewarded with the role of Piper after years of hard work, especially when I fell in love with the character after my first audition.\\" Hazel flew to Melbourne from her home in Sydney to meet with the casting director and audition for the role. This was followed by two more rounds of auditioning and a waiting period spread over a few months, until she was given the role. Hazel's biggest challenge during the auditioning process was the financial cost of getting to Melbourne, as she was a university student with a small budget. But she was confident that she would secure the role, saying \\"something just felt right about the whole situation\\". Hazel relocated to Melbourne within three days to be available for fittings and filming the following week. She told Anthony Graetz of CLIQUE Mag that she wanted to be with Neighbours for a few years, but had plans to relocate to Los Angeles or the UK for further acting work. Hazel made her debut as Piper on 16 September 2015. Development =Webisodes and introduction= Ahead of her first appearance in the main show, the character was featured in a series of webisodes titled Hey Piper, which see her talking to various family members via online video calls. The first episode saw Piper introduced to her half- sister Paige Smith (Olympia Valance), shortly after the Erinsborough tornado. Their first interaction is \\"very awkward\\", as Paige mentions several family events that Piper does not know about. In the second episode, Piper calls her grandfather Doug Willis (Terence Donovan) to catch-up with him and go over new ideas for her blog. The third and fourth episodes feature Piper's father, Brad Willis (Kip Gamblin) informing her that he has separated from her mother and has begun a relationship with Lauren Carpenter (Kate Kendall). He later tries to comfort an upset Piper. Piper arrived home to find her parents in the middle of an argument, which Hazel likened to \\"something from Jerry Springer!\\" The actress explained that Piper's siblings had told her about the fights the family had been having, which prompted her return from Canada. Piper believed that she might be \\"the glue that holds them all together.\\" Hazel also said that Piper did not want to be forced into taking sides in her parents' separation and tried to view things objectively. She just wanted to find her place within the family again, but it was hard due to everything that was happening between Brad and Terese (Rebekah Elmaloglou). While she is out filming for her vlog, Piper meets Brad's new partner, Lauren. She is initially unaware of who Lauren is and finds her to be nice and kind. When Paige later introduced them, Piper was \\"torn\\" as she had planned on hating Lauren for breaking up her family. Piper did not like Terese's attitude towards her marriage, as she thought Brad would be less likely to work through their issues if she kept pushing him away. However, the more time Piper spent with her mother, she began to understand her more. As Piper continues to film her vlog around Erinsborough, she befriends Ben Kirk (Felix Mallard). They have a platonic lunch together and discuss their mutual tastes in music. They later unintentionally caused some trouble at the local car garage. Hazel said that Piper notices that Ben is not like their peers and they form a \\"really great friendship\\". The actress added that they are not necessary the best influence on each other. While she continued to settle in, Piper began receiving text messages from her former boyfriend Brodie \\"Chas\\" Chaswick (Matt Testro). Hazel explained that Piper ended the relationship shortly before coming home to Australia, but Chas believed the distance was not a problem for them, so they stayed in touch. =Characterisation= During the casting process, Hazel and the producers shared a similar vision of what they wanted the character to be and Hazel was \\"so grateful\\" that they trusted her to bring Piper's quirkiness and storylines to life. Hazel shares some of the same personality traits with Piper and found that the character was not much of a challenge to portray, as she felt that she \\"knew this girl, knew what she was about.\\" The actress also found that being so similar to Piper meant that she took criticism of her personally. Hazel wished she had been similar to Piper when she was her age, and she felt that she was slowly growing up to be like Piper. In an interview with Carena Crawford from All About Soap, Hazel described Piper as having typical traits of a teenager, saying she was \\"technology-loving, free- thinking, liberated\\". She also said Piper was mature and intelligent, with \\"a quick wit and dry sense of humour.\\" In an interview published on the official website, Hazel also described Piper as being fun, having a \\"cool approach to life\\" and someone who can be herself \\"unapologetically\\". Hazel enjoyed playing a character with a rebellious personality, but pointed out that for all of Piper's maturity and intelligence, she \\"doesn't have a filter when it comes to her actions.\\" During an interview for the show's official website, Hazel believed Piper's dream job would be a journalist at BuzzFeed or somewhere similar. She would enjoy voicing her opinions in \\"a very 21st century environment.\\" Hazel did not think Piper was the type of person who finished high school, instead she would just apply for internships in the industry she wanted to work in. Hazel told Tim Falk of TV Soap that getting to live in Piper's Doc Martens, and the opportunity she got as an actor were the best things about playing Piper. She said that future storylines would see different aspects of Piper's personality. She continued, \\"There's lots of mischief, some deceit and guilt in store for Piper.\\" Hazel added that viewers would get to see Piper's vulnerable side, as she lets her guard down. Piper struggled growing up in her elder siblings' Imogen (Ariel Kaplan) and Josh's (Harley Bonner) shadows. Imogen was academic, while Josh excelled at sports, so Piper did not have a strong identity within the family until she went to Canada, where she built up an identity for herself. Unlike Imogen, Piper prefers to discover things for herself instead of learning from a book. Herbison called Piper the \\"anti-Imogen\\", as she tries to be different from her family. But Piper does have \\"the Willis temper\\", and like her mother, she is very independent. She also shares a strong bond with her father. When Piper meets Paige for the first time, they get along well. Hazel stated, \\"They both have this sort of sparky, sassy assertion about their character.\\" Piper becomes good friends with her neighbour Xanthe Canning (Lilly Van der Meer). Hazel initially thought Piper would not be friends with someone like Xanthe, but she realised that Xanthe brings out Piper's \\"girlie side\\", while Piper is always there for Xanthe. Hazel and Van der Meer are also friends in real life. Hazel said their scenes together are fun to film, as all the screaming and laughing comes naturally to them. When asked if Piper could end up dating Xanthe's boyfriend Ben, if they ever broke up, Hazel replied \\"Even when Xanthe wasn't in the picture Ben and Piper were just mates.\\" =Erinsborough High fire= One of the character's early storylines involved her in a fire stunt at the local high school. During a charity sleep out at Erinsborough High, Piper encourages her new friend Ben to light a piece of paper on fire and set off the sprinkler system. However, it soon causes a \\"devastating fire\\" that leaves Piper's mother Terese with burns to her body. Both Ben and Piper are \\"guilt-ridden\\" by their actions, and she urges him to keep quiet about their involvement. However, Ben soon confesses everything to his grandparents and the police. As he faces a charge of reckless conduct, Piper struggles with her guilt, especially as she knows that her mother is suffering. While Ben keeps quiet about her role in the incident, Piper eventually tells Lauren that she shares some of the responsibility and Lauren urges her to tell the truth. Instead, Piper suggests to Ben that they run away and he agrees. They initially sleep rough in Erinsborough, before fleeing to Glenrowan, where they get jobs as fruit pickers. Ben begins to struggle with pain from his fractured ribs, which he sustained in an earlier accident, and later collapses. As Piper prepares to return to her classes for the first time since the fire, she is nervous about the reaction of the other students, leading her to confide in neighbour Tyler Brennan (Travis Burns), who gives her reassurance that she will probably be seen as a hero. Upon her arrival at the school, Piper receives a mixed reaction from her peers. Some of them laud her part in the fire, while others are wary and scared. Piper \\"swiftly retreats home\\", where Tyler suggests that she could ask her parents not to send her back to school. When she does return, Piper is given a lighter, which she uses to threaten the students who try to get in her way. Piper's threats are overheard by Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne). =Relationship with Tyler Brennan= As Piper continues her friendship with Tyler, she soon develops romantic feelings for him. Burns told an Inside Soap reporter that both characters share common interests and are \\"young, free and spirited\\". Tyler is oblivious to how strongly Piper feels about him, so when he lets her down gently, he feels satisfied with how he handled the situation. Piper then encourages Tyler to attend a singles' night, in the hope that he will pick her. When they return home, Piper initiates a kiss between them. Burns said Tyler was \\"shocked\\" by the kiss, explaining \\"There's a connection between them, but Tyler has never seen it in a romantic way. He's worried about the age difference, and then there's the fact that Piper's dad Brad is staying with the Brennans ‚Äì so it could be awkward!\\" Piper eventually tells Tyler about her feelings for him. While he admits to liking her too, he urges her to stay away, as he feels that he will only cause her trouble. Ignoring his warning, Piper is \\"crushed\\" when Tyler refuses to change his mind. She then witnesses him kissing barmaid Courtney Grixti (Emma Lane). Piper and Tyler continue to share \\"a mutual attraction\\", but Tyler wants to have her parents' approval before they start a romantic relationship. Speaking to an Inside Soap columnist, Hazel explained that deep down Piper knows Brad and Terese will not support her relationship with Tyler. Piper tells Tyler that her parents have given them their blessing, in the hope that she will be able to bring them around to the idea. Hazel continued, \\"She hates lying to Tyler, but worries that he'll break up with her if he learns the truth.\\" While Tyler believes that they have Brad and Terese's approval, he and Piper begin quietly dating and they plan to consummate their relationship on the night of the school formal. Hazel told the columnist that Piper wants to show Tyler how much he means to her. She also said that despite Piper's feminist views and \\"grungy\\" style, she was a romantic. What's on TV's Tess Lamacraft asked Hazel if Piper was really in love with Tyler, and the actress replied that she was. Hazel explained that their relationship had been born out of a friendship and they found that they \\"just click\\". She told Lamacraft that they shared an \\"unspoken attraction and chemistry between them\\", which felt right. Hazel also found that Tyler helped to ground Piper, while she made him a better person. The pairing of Piper and Tyler proved popular with viewers, and Hazel appreciated the support for their romance, as it made filming with Burns more exciting. She admitted to being surprised by the positive reaction to the couple and said the writers would consider it as they write future storylines. The couple were given the portmanteau \\"Typer\\" by fans. Piper made an enemy of her teacher Elly Conway (actress Jodi Anasta pictured) when she accused Elly of flirting with Tyler. On the night of the school formal, Piper's parents learn she is planning on losing her virginity to Tyler and Terese bans them from attending the dance together. Piper tries to give her mother an ultimatum that either she attends the formal with Tyler or does not go at all, which \\"backfires massively\\" and she ends up with no plans for the night. Piper is also forced to tell Tyler that she lied to him and he \\"reluctantly\\" breaks up with her. Shortly after, he speaks to Brad about his feelings for Piper and convinces Terese to change her mind about them dating. Piper later finds Tyler talking to Elly Conway (Jodi Anasta) in The Waterhole bar. A jealous Piper throws a drink over Elly. Upon learning of Piper's actions, Brad takes her to the Kennedys' to apologise to Susan for her behaviour at the formal. Piper is \\"stunned\\" when Elly appears, and she learns that Elly is Susan's niece and her new English teacher. Hazel thought Piper's parents were to blame for everything that occurred at the formal. She commented, \\"Piper isn't responsible for her actions. It was such an unreasonable reaction by Terese.\\" The formal marked the beginning of a feud with Elly, and Hazel pointed out that the teacher's flirtatious personality was \\"the epitome of what Piper would dislike in a person.\\" Piper soon notices that Elly holds \\"a big grudge\\" against her. Hazel told Daniel Falconer from FemaleFirst that Piper tries to explain to other adults that she is feeling bullied by her teacher, who has been purposely marking her work down and insulting her. However, due to Elly's denials, everyone believes her over Piper. Hazel commented that Piper's resilience eventually forces Susan to investigate and she finds that Piper has been telling the truth. Susan then makes Elly apologise. When asked if Piper and Tyler had any chance of reconciling, Hazel explained that Piper is hopeful, but she also realises that she has \\"completely lost herself to a guy\\" which is unlike her. The actress was pleased the writers were giving the characters some time apart. When Piper discovers Tyler is having a casual relationship with Paige, she gets revenge by playing footage of them having sex in the garage at Brad and Terese's divorce party. In an interview with Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy, Hazel told him that Piper was acting on impulse and she thought that Tyler and Paige had to be caught out for lying to Piper. Piper wants them to feel as \\"humiliated\\" as she does. Piper also feels guilty when Jack Callahan (Andrew Morley) turns up and sees the footage, as he has feelings for Paige. Her parents express their disappointment in her and Piper finds herself all alone. Hazel told Falconer (FemaleFirst) that Piper is aware that she and Tyler have to rebuild their friendship before they try to begin a romantic relationship again. =One-night stand= In October 2016, a trailer showing Piper growing closer to friend and neighbour Angus Beaumont-Hannay (Jai Waetford) was released, leading to speculation that they would have sex. It later emerged that Piper would lose her virginity to Angus following another rejection from Tyler. The storyline begins with Tyler supporting Piper through various incidents, including her father's hospitalisation. Piper later attempts to kiss him, but he pulls away, which leaves her hurt and she runs off. Piper meets Angus and they share \\"a night of reckless teenage fun\\", where they admit that they might have been better off as a couple, instead of getting their hearts broken by Tyler and Elly respectively. As Angus talks to Piper and says some nice things to her, she is \\"surprised by his maturity and understanding of the situation\\", which makes her look at him in a different way. Piper kisses Angus, and they have sex in her car. The following morning, they are found and woken up by Tyler's brother Aaron Brennan (Matt Wilson), leaving them both embarrassed. Hazel stated, \\"I think there's a bit of regret, but on the surface Piper is very brazen about what's happened. She's really trying to convince herself that she's over Tyler.\\" Aaron informs Tyler what he saw, leaving Tyler devastated, as he had decided that he was ready to commit to his relationship with Piper. =Departure= On 22 February 2019, Jess Lee of Digital Spy reported that Hazel could be leaving Neighbours, after noticing that she was no longer posting photos of the set to her social media accounts. Comments from her co-stars Elmaloglou, who stated that she misses Hazel, and Takaya Honda also appeared to confirm that the actress had left the cast. Hazel's management also updated her online CV, implying that she had finished filming. Speaking to a Herald Sun reporter, Hazel said she chose to leave Neighbours to further her acting career and challenge herself with new roles. She explained, \\"It's the end of an era for me, I've learned so much about myself as an actor and I've had to grow up pretty quick. It's hard because you're leaving full- time employment but I was itching to learn more and challenge myself.\\" Spoilers for the week commencing 1 April 2019 confirmed that the character would be leaving on 3 April. After arguing with her sister Imogen, Piper decides to leave town and meet up with Tyler in Adelaide. Storylines Piper arrives home from Canada amidst a family argument. The following day, she meets her half-sister Paige in person, and Lauren Turner, her father's new girlfriend. While filming for her vlog, Piper befriends Ben Kirk and they spend the day together.

A fire breaks out at Erinsborough High during a charity sleep out. Piper's mother suffers serious burns and Piper pushes Brad away when it emerges he saved Lauren before Terese. Ben soon confesses to starting the fire, while Piper admits to Lauren that she encouraged him to set the sprinklers off as a joke. Piper and Ben run away and find jobs as fruit pickers.

When Brad stops coaching Brodie, he and Piper plan to leave for Perth, but Piper changes her mind and calls Tyler to collect her. Josh and Piper's grandfather die from injuries caused by an explosion at the local hotel. Piper's half-brother Ned Willis (Ben Hall) also arrives in town and supports Piper. She initially suspects Brodie caused the explosion, but he has an alibi. Piper and Tyler become close, but Terese will not allow them to date because of the age difference. However, Piper tells Tyler that they have Brad's approval, so they date in secret. Terese agrees to let Tyler accompany Piper to the school formal, but changes her mind when she learns Piper plans to lose her virginity to him that night. When Piper sees Tyler with a woman at The Waterhole, she becomes jealous and throws a drink over her. She later learns the woman is her new English teacher Elly Conway. Piper learns Tyler is casual dating Paige and she gets revenge on them by showing their sex tape at her parents' divorce party. Piper realises that Elly is deliberately marking her down and when Elly insults her, Piper makes a formal complaint. Her claims are initially not believed, until Susan catches Elly marking Piper down and she is made to apologise. Piper's family forget her birthday, but Tyler takes her to the beach for the day. When Piper later attempts to kiss Tyler, he pulls away. While Piper and Angus are watching fireworks together, they talk about unrequited love and Piper loses her virginity to him. Tyler learns what happened between Piper and Angus and admits that he is disappointed by her actions. Piper announces she is done with their relationship. However, when she learns Tyler is being threatened by Tim Collins's (Ben Anderson) for crashing his car, Piper blackmails Tim into dropping the police charges. Piper and Tyler reconcile at Brad and Lauren's wedding, and finally consummate their relationship. Brad and Terese refuse to support them, due to Piper's age. When Brad attacks Tyler, he and Piper run away together. They eventually return to Erinsborough and briefly stay at Robinson's Motel, before Leo Tanaka (Tim Kano) invites them to move into his backpackers' hostel.

Piper decides to apply for emancipation, so she can access social security payments, but changes her mind when Tyler gets a job. Piper buys a fake ID from Bec Simmons (Zenya Carmellotti) so she can enter the bar where Tyler works, but Elly finds her and takes the ID. She asks for the name of the person who made it, but Piper refuses to tell her. When Bec is suspended, another student forces Piper to get her a fake ID. Piper then joins forces with Willow Somers (Mieke Billing- Smith) to make and sell IDs, but Piper is soon caught by Elly. Piper fractures her leg and pelvis when a ute is reversed into the backpackers'. She decides to move back home, while she recovers. Piper challenges acting principal Finn Kelly (Rob Mills) when he makes changes to the school. She organises a student strike, but calls it off when Finn threatens to suspend her. Piper posts a vlog about misogyny and mentions the incident with Chas, which causes him to post several angry comments. The comments soon attract trolls, who attack Piper online. Susan advises against posting a response, but after Piper learns that Xanthe is being targeted too, she posts a new vlog. She continues to reply to her trolls, but later reports them to the administrator of her blog. Piper learns she has been doxxed and that her private videos and photos have been leaked online. When Piper is about to sit her VCE English exam, Tyler shows her faked text messages designed to show that she is in a relationship with T-Bone. This leads to Tyler and Piper breaking up, but Tyler later learns that the texts were faked by Hamish, so that Tyler would sail away with him. Piper goes to Tyler's boat to make amends with him, but Hamish's ex-girlfriend Louise traps Piper on board and sets sail for Indonesia. Accidentally falling overboard, Piper washes up on a beach and looks for help, but she collapses, suffering from hypothermia. An anonymous man finds her and calls an ambulance, and she is taken to Erinsborough Hospital, where she recovers and reconciles with Tyler. Later she has a panic attack while in a backyard swimming pool. After Tyler is charged with murder, Piper urges Ben to change his story to the police. But after Xanthe confronts her, Piper tells Ben not to lie to the police. The day before Tyler's trial, Piper arranges for them to spend the night in a hotel in the city. She convinces Tyler that they should go on the run, and they change their appearances. However, the police soon turn up at the hotel after receiving a tip off. Tyler and Piper go up to the roof and Tyler jumps across to the next building, leaving Piper behind. Piper decides to follow, but she is left hanging from the edge.

Imogen returns to Erinsborough to fill in for Toadie and, after learning Piper is having sex with Leo, demands she tell Terese. Piper tells Leo about Imogen's ultimatum, and he accidentally reveals their relationship during an argument with Terese and Paul. Terese thinks he seduced her daughter out of revenge, before saying she thought Piper had more self respect. Terese later apologises and Piper continues her relationship with Leo.

Imogen tells Piper that she has just been treading water, and is unhappy with herself. During Josh and Doug's memorial, Piper announces that she needs to leave Erinsborough, so she ends her relationship with Leo.

Reception For her portrayal of Piper, Hazel received a nomination for Best Daytime Star at the 2018 Inside Soap Awards. She was also nominated in the \\"Best Soap Actor (Female)\\" category at the 2018 Digital Spy Reader Awards; she came in eighth place with 5.2% of the total votes. Carena Crawford of All About Soap noted, \\"it doesn't take Piper long to create shock waves when she comes to Erinsborough!\\" Piper's arrival on UK screens was chosen as one of the top five soap moments by an Inside Soap reporter for 30 September. They stated \\"the poor girl has an awful lot to catch up on...\\" Another columnist for the publication branded the character \\"quirky\\". While Channel 5 dubbed her \\"elusive\\", due to her earlier absence from her family. Tess Lamacraft of What's on TV observed that Piper was \\"headstrong\\" and a \\"feisty, free-spirit\\". When Piper went to spy on Tyler and Imogen's date, a Inside Soap reporter disapproved of her actions, commenting \\"Not cool Piper, not cool...\\" In June 2016, Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy named Piper as one of ten rising stars of the soap opera world. He wrote that as the show had delayed the character's introduction for so long, there was potential for her to be \\"a disappointment\\", but Kilkelly stated that Hazel's performance \\"had been a real breath of fresh air and she proved her worth early on with Piper's heartbreaking reaction to Josh's death.\\" Kilkelly hoped Piper's future storylines would be bigger and less focused on romance. A reporter for TV Soap called Piper and Tyler a \\"controversial couple\\". Following the end of their relationship, Burns created a petition asking if the couple should reunite. He planned to show the producers if the petition received 1,500 votes. He received over 1,700 responses from fans, showing their support for the couple. Following the character's exit in 2019, Maddison Hockey of TV Week stated: \\"Smart, witty and unafraid to stand out from the crowd, Piper was best known for her turbulent relationship with Tyler Brennan (Travis Burns).\\" References External links * Piper Willis at the Official Neighbours website Neighbours characters Television characters introduced in 2015 Fictional waiting staff Fictional Greek people in television Fictional stalking victims Fictional bisexual females Willis family Fictional LGBT characters in television Female characters in television ","title":"Piper Willis"},{"id":"51262052","text":"Halimium halimifolium is a species of flowering plant in the family Cistaceae, native to Mediterranean Basin.

It was delisted in 2019. Secured behind a locked fence, the building and Zero Mile Post were last accessible to the public in 1994 when the structure served as a passenger depot for the New Georgia Railroad, a tourist rail line that ceased operation. Inside the same structure, access to the Zero Mile Post was limited in recent years to appointments approved by the Georgia Building Authority. The Zero Mile Post on display in the Atlanta History Center (December 8, 2018) In October 2018, the Zero Mile Post was carefully and successfully relocated to the Atlanta History Center from the Georgia Building Authority's property located underneath the Central Avenue Bridge. The building that housed the Zero Mile Post is slated for demolition before the end of 2018 to accommodate the rebuilding of the Central Avenue and Courtland Street bridges.

The Bishop Mar Gregorios Vayaliparambil (1899‚Äì1966) belonged to this parish church. For long time the church at Ankamaly and the Mor Sabor and Mor Afroth chapel at Akaparambu were a united parish and was administered by one council. Mar Sabor & Mar Afroth Mar Sabor and Mar Proth Mar Sabor and Mar Afroth were two holy men who came to Malabar to preach the Gospel with a group of Assyrian Christian(Nestorians ) immigrants led by a merchant named Sapor Esho. They were said to have landed at Quilon (Kollam) in circa 822. There is no documentary evidence in church records and government archives that Mar Sabor, Mar Afroth and Sapor Esho brought a group of Syrian Christian immigrants.The Chera king of that period thought they were merchants because merchants from abroad frequently came to Kerala ‚Äî Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Persians and Jews. The Chera ruler assuming Sapor Isho was a merchant gave him copper plates with privileges and a village inhabited by lower castes, as it was the custom in those days to entertain foreign merchants. Mar Sapor later known as Mar Abo. His tomb is at Thevalakkara St St Marys orthodox Valiyapally.

This converted local community was the nucleus which grew into a major Syrian Christian community in Kerala. They were brought up by Sapor Eso in the tradition of St. Thomas faith. When the Portuguese came to Kerala, they found that these bishops using Syriac liturgy and therefore they called them Syriac Christians to distinguish them from Latin Christians converted by the Portuguese who were using Latin liturgy. Mar Sapor elevated a local convert to the position of catechist (kathanar) and he became famous as a Kadamuttathu Kathanarr. According to legends, he maintained contact with his former tribal leaders and through them he learnt magical and mystical powers. Mar Sapor is remembered for converting the entire village of lower castes given to him by the Rajah and this led to the growth in numerical numbers of local converts who later called themselves Syrian Christians because of the Syriac liturgy introduced by Mar Sapor .

Kimball and Richards' company incorporated in 1908 to \\"engage in real estate and investment business.\\" D. Carlos Kimball was President, Stephen L. Richards, Vice-President, and Claude Richards, Secretary and Treasurer. The company was the largest early developer in the city, and boasted the introduction of installment plans for property purchasing in the Mountain West. Kimball and Richards was responsible for more than 30 subdivisions between 1900 and 1925, including Highland Park (1909), Jackson Square (1909), Yalecrest, (1913-1914), and Gilmer Park (1919) They also had additional investment and interest in other Utah counties as well as Idaho. Original Costs and Amenities Kimball and Richards advertised Jackson Square as a sound investment, declaring it \\"the cheapest home site property in the city,\\" that offered the opportunity to double the money \\"before the expiration of your payment contract.\\" Cost for a lot was listed at $500 and up (though by July, the price had dropped to $475 and up), and the firm offered payment terms of $15 down and $15 a month. The neighborhood was praised as being a convenient walking distance to the urban center while still being \\"away from the rustle and bustle, dirt and smoke of the city.\\" Other amenities included water mains, nearby city electricity, cement curbing and walks, excellent soil for gardening, and \\"Corner stone monuments that add tone and distinction to the subdivision.\\" Corner Stone Monuments Based on sketches and photographic evidence, the Jackson Square development once included 12-18 stone monuments which stood on each corner of the neighborhood. In 1909, Shipler Commercial Photographs captured images of Kimball and Richards workers clearing earth and building the stone monuments, including in the Jackson Square subdivision. These photos were also used in newspapers advertisements for Jackson Square. The stone monuments included embedded Jackson Square name plaques, along with appropriate street name plaques on two sides. They were also capped with orbs. Today, only one monument remains standing; it is on the southwest corner of Edith and 300 East, though the original orb is missing. The base of another pillar can be found on the southeast corner of Hampton and 200 East. The extant pillar is a PokeStop called \\"Third East Jackson Square Street Marker\\" in the popular game Pok√©mon Go.

She is best known for her role in the Dioclean civil war, where she violently intervened in a succession crisis following the death of her husband, Constantine Bodin. Life  Jaquinta was the daughter of Argyritzos (Archirizus), the Norman governor of Bari in the County of Apulia. The Dioclean king Michael I selected her as wife for his son Constantine Bodin, recently returned from captivity in Antioch, shortly after his coronation in 1077. According to the Annales Barenses, the two wed in April 1078, but the marriage may have taken place any time after. The union cemented the alliance between Dioclea and Norman Sicily against the Byzantine Empire. The couple's sons were Michael, George, Archiriz and Thomas. =Queenship = Michael died in 1081 and was succeeded as king by Constantine. Queen Jaquinta was a \\"powerful force and significant influence\\"; the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja portrays her as the power behind the throne. She saw Michael's nephew Branislav as a threat to her husband and children. Her sons were young (less than 15 or 10 years of age) and thus in a weak position; Jaquinta feared that if Constantine died before they reached majority, Branislav would usurp the throne. She urged her husband to imprison him, and the opportunity was seized when Branislav arrived to the capital Skadar unattended with his brother and son. Branislav died soon after, but six of his brothers and six of his sons were still at liberty. They were granted asylum by the Republic of Ragusa. After Ragusa refused to expel them, Constantine started a siege of the city, during which a favourite of the queen was killed. Enraged, she convinced her husband to have Branislav's imprisoned brother and son beheaded before the city walls; church authorities eventually mediated peace, but Branislav's exiled family continued to seek revenge. = Succession crisis = A partial maledictory inscription found in the cathedral of Bari is sometimes considered a mocking epitaph of Jaquinta. This is unlikely, since she was not buried there and did not live in the city most of her adult life.Antonio Beatillo first proposed the identification and was followed by Giulio Petroni, but cf. Francesco Babudri, \\"Di una singolare iscrizione greca nella Cattedrale di Bari\\", Iapigia 7 (1936), pp. 127‚Äì46. By the time her husband died 1101, Queen Jaquinta was the most hated member of the feuding royal family. A war of succession ensued, with the dowager fighting for her minor son Michael against Constantine's four half-brothers. Jaquinta's nephew Vladimir prevailed in 1103, but she continued to intrigue on behalf of her progeny, this time George. In 1118, in Kotor, she gave Vladimir a dose of a slow-working poison. The dying King was taken to Skadar, where she followed him in order to make sure of her son's accession. There Jaquinta accused her brother-in-law Dobroslav, deposed and imprisoned during the 1101‚Äì03 succession crisis. Unconvinced, Vladimir expelled her from Skadar. Jaquinta expected Dobroslav to be released and restored to the throne following Vladimir's imminent death. Thus, as soon as the king was dead, Jaquinta had her henchmen enter the jail and castrate and blind Dobroslav, who was then sent to a Skadar monastery. After George's accession, many pro- Byzantine members of the royal family fled to Dyrrachium. They soon returned in the company of a Byzantine army which ousted George and captured Jaquinta. She was taken to Constantinople, where she died imprisoned.

He was a senator for the Italian Social Movement ‚Äì National Right (, MSI‚ÄìDN) (1972‚Äì1991). He gained particular notoriety for his role as a popular leader during the Reggio revolt of 1970‚Äì1971. Reggio revolt In July 1970, Franco, at the time a trade union leader from the National Italian Workers' Union (CISNAL) close to the neofascist movement, became the informal leader of the rebel Action Committee and of the revolt. La Rivolta di Reggio Calabria, Archivio'900 The cause of the protests was a government decision to make Catanzaro, not Reggio Calabria, regional capital of Calabria.Partridge, Italian politics today, p. 50 On September 17, 1970, he was arrested along with other leaders of the revolt on charges of incitement in a police sweep that targeted some 100 people.

He explained that many potentially leftist youths \\"today are fascists simply because they believe that the battle of Reggio is interpreted fairly only by the fascists.\\" La brutta avventura di Reggio Calabria, La Repubblica, January 5, 2008 The revolt ended up by being taken over by neo-fascists (relevant was also the role of the militant neo- fascist movement National VanguardFerraresi, Threats to Democracy, p. 67) and led to unexpected electoral fortunes for the Italian Social Movement at the Italian general election in May 1972, when Franco was elected senator. The neo-fascists benefitted, because the Christian Democrats were divided, while the city was one of its fiefdoms, and the Italian Communist Party (PCI) supported the suppression of the riots. Senator In 1972, Franco was investigated for distributing leaflets hostile to the anti-fascist demonstration organized by the left-wing trade unions in the city of Reggio Calabria on October 22, 1972.

His models were South European leaders like Francisco Franco, Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar and those of the Greek junta, he told journalist Fallaci in 1971.

He studied in both the UK and France, at the Architectural Association School of Architecture and the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, and returned to work as an architect after serving in the First World War. He rose to prominence in the 1930s, featuring in a book by architectural critic Trystan Edwards and winning the commission in 1932 to design Walthamstow Town Hall, which was eventually completed in 1942. He lived in Zoffany House in Strand- on-the-Green, Chiswick, London, from 1936. During the Second World War, he was appointed one of the Principal Architects of the Imperial War Graves Commission (now the Commonwealth War Graves Commission). In this post-war stage of his career, he designed several war memorials and numerous cemeteries for the British war dead. Examples of his Commission work are found in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. His work was said to have followed the style of that of two of his predecessors as Commission architects, Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker. Hepworth, who died in 1963, was described in his obituary as an architect of \\"great speed and brilliance\\" and \\"sensitivity and eccentricity\\", influenced by \\"classical, English and local Norman styles\\". A number of his buildings are listed. Studies and early career Hepworth studied at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts Hepworth was born in 1890. He attended Highgate School from September 1902 until July 1906. His initial architectural studies were at the Architectural Association School of Architecture from 1906 to 1910, during which time he also attended the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France. He became assistant to London-based architect Walter Frederick Cave, and after further travels in France he passed his Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) qualifying exam in 1911. He was awarded RIBA's 1914 British School at Rome scholarship. During the First World War, he served in the Royal Engineers. After the war, he returned to working as an architect. Architectural historians the Lingards describe him as \\"one of the finest architectural draughtsmen of his day\\". One of his works from this period was L'Usine (1922), described by the Lingards as \\"a utopian industrial city scene\\" with \\"influences of early Futurism\\". Hepworth produced the design for the Lloyds Bank branch in Southwark that opened in 1928. In the design, he used \\"rusticated stone up to the sills of the first-floor windows and red brick in Flemish bond for the remaining two storeys, surmounted by a hipped roof clad in pantiles.\\" Another early design was that of an arts-and-crafts thatched house named 'Bolton Muir' (1930) in Gifford, East Lothian. Pre-war and municipal work Walthamstow Town Hall (1942) Hepworth's residence at Zoffany House In 1931, Hepworth was featured in a book by architectural critic Trystan Edwards. Published in Zug, Switzerland, this 91-page hardback book, part of a series on the leading architects of the day, was titled Some recent work of Philip Hepworth. It was illustrated mostly with black-and-white photographs of the buildings designed by Hepworth. The embossed clothbound cover shows the Roof Garden House in Bickley, with the cover artwork described in 2015 by RIBA's British Architectural Library as \\"[an] image charged with the energetic spirit of Art Deco\\". Hepworth won a major municipal architectural commission in the 1930s with his design for Walthamstow Town Hall (now known as Waltham Forest Town Hall). Built from 1937 to 1942, this complex of buildings is also known as Walthamstow Civic Centre and the commission was awarded to Hepworth in 1932 following an architectural competition launched in 1929 by the newly created municipal borough of Walthamstow. The building became Grade II listed on 9 March 1982. Hepworth's design of Walthamstow Town Hall (and associated buildings) was described by architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner in 1954 as in \\"the Swedish style of c.1925 which became so popular in England amongst those who were not satisfied to be imitatively Neo-Georgian nor wanted to go modern or earnest.\\"Pevsner's Buildings of England, Essex (1954), quoted in From 1936, Hepworth lived in and restored Zoffany House in Strand-on-the- Green, Chiswick, London, formerly the home of the 18th-century painter Johan Zoffany. Zoffany House was listed as Grade II* on 11 July 1951. Hepworth also designed County Hall in Trowbridge (begun in 1938 and finished in 1940). Around the start of World War II, Hepworth designed a Roman Catholic church in Wales, paid for by the Hon. Fflorens Roch, (wife of Walter Roch and daughter of Lord Treowen). This is Our Lady of Peace (1939‚Äì40) at Newbridge, now a Grade II* listed building, with a large campanile. This church was granted Grade II* listed status on 17 March 1999. World War II and CWGC In World War II, as he was too old for active service, Hepworth served in the Home Guard. During the war, he was appointed to the Royal Academy of Arts' Planning Committee for the rebuilding of London following the damage caused during the Blitz. This committee was chaired by Sir Edwin Lutyens, who was a good friend of Hepworth. In 1944, Hepworth was appointed the Principal Architect for North-West Europe for the Imperial War Graves Commission (later the Commonwealth War Graves Commission [CWGC]). Other Principal Architects appointed by the Commission to take on the task of designing a new set of memorials and cemeteries after World War II included Sir Hubert Worthington and Sir Edward Maufe. Hepworth designed post-World War II CWGC cemeteries in Normandy, France, as well as in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. The CWGC memorials he designed were the Dunkirk Memorial (1957) to the missing of the British Expeditionary Force that fell at the start of the war during the fall of France, and the Bayeux Memorial (1955) to the missing of the British forces that fell in the Normandy Campaign in the liberation of France. The CWGC cemeteries he designed included the Berlin 1939‚Äì1945 War Cemetery, Becklingen War Cemetery, B√©ny-sur-Mer Canadian War Cemetery, and Groesbeek Canadian War Cemetery. Others were Brouay War Cemetery (Brouay), Tilly-sur-Seulles War Cemetery (Bayeux), La D√©livrande War Cemetery (Douvres-la-D√©livrande), Jerusalem War Cemetery (Chouain), Ranville War Cemetery (Banneville-la- Campagne), Bretteville-sur-Laize Canadian War Cemetery, Kiel War Cemetery (Kiel), Rheinberg War Cemetery and Reichswald Forest War Cemetery (Klever Reichswald). Hepworth planned the layout of his cemeteries only after intensive consultations with gardeners. Historian Philip Longworth, author of a history of the Commission, gave his view on Hepworth's Commission work in a 1963 obituary: Final years Hepworth died in a London hospital on 21 February 1963. Obituaries were published in volume 70 of the RIBA Journal and in volume 204 of The Builder.

The episode was written by Andrew Kreisberg and Geoff Johns, based on a story by Greg Berlanti, Kreisberg, and Johns, and directed by David Nutter. It was first broadcast on October 7, 2014, on The CW. The show is a spin-off from Arrow where many of the characters in The Flash were introduced during its second season. The episode revolves around Barry Allen (Grant Gustin), a forensic scientist working for the Central City Police Department. On the night of the launch of a particle accelerator, a malfunction causes it to explode during a storm. At the same time, Barry is struck by lightning. He wakes from a coma after nine months, and discovers that he has developed a new power: super speed. He is helped by S.T.A.R. Labs' personnel, led by Dr. Harrison Wells (Tom Cavanagh), who are trying to control his speed so that he can use it for greater good. CW executives, impressed by early cuts of Barry Allen's appearances in the first two episodes of Arrow, ordered a stand-alone pilot. This allowed the creative team to flesh out his story and his world with a larger budget, as opposed to a backdoor pilot's constraint of incorporating characters from the parent show The Flash. Colleen Atwood, Arrows costume designer, created the Flash's suit. The creative team wanted to make sure that the Flash resembled his comic book counterpart, and was not a poor imitation. The pilot was ordered on January 29, 2014, and on May 8, 2014, The Flash was picked up as a series, with an initial order from The CW for 13 episodes. The pilot was first screened at the Warner Bros. Television and DC Entertainment panel at the San Diego Comic-Con International in July 2014. When it premiered, the pilot had a strong debut attracting 4.83 million viewers. It was the second-most watched premiere on The CW, behind the pilot episode of The Vampire Diaries broadcast in 2009. The episode received critical acclaim with praise for the tone (considered better than Arrows), Gustin's performance as Barry, the action scenes, costume design, and the supporting cast.  Plot  The episode begins with Barry Allen, a forensic crime scene investigator for the Central City Police Department, recounting his youth, specifically a lightning storm in which his mother was murdered by a yellow blur and his father falsely imprisoned for the crime. In the present, Barry and his best friend Iris West attend the unveiling of a particle accelerator at S.T.A.R. Labs created by Dr. Harrison Wells. Meanwhile, Iris' father, Detective Joe West, and his partner Fred Chyre use evidence Barry discovered to find Clyde and Mark Mardon. Clyde killed Chyre as they escape on a plane. However, the particle accelerator explodes, creating a storm cloud and unleashing a wave of dark matter. The Mardon brothers are presumed dead after their plane crashes, and Barry is struck by lightning. Nine months later, Barry wakes up from a coma in S.T.A.R. Labs and meets Caitlin Snow, Cisco Ramon, and Harrison Wells, who is now wheelchair-bound following the explosion. They attempt to explain his genetic changes. Though initially pre-occupied with getting back to his life and seeing Iris, Barry experiences superhuman speed and returns to the S.T.A.R. Labs team to test his abilities. Clyde Mardon later resurfaces with the ability to control the weather. Barry unsuccessfully tried to stop him, though he was able to identify him and his superhuman powers to Joe West, who refuses to believe his claims about Clyde or how his mother was murdered. Barry confronts the team about the other \\"meta-humans\\" created from the explosion, wanting to stop Clyde, but Wells doesn't want to risk the \\"treasures\\" within Barry's genetics. Feeling lost and hurt, Barry pays a visit to Starling City's Oliver Queen, alias \\"the Arrow\\", who encourages him to his heroic potential. Barry returns to Central City and convinces Caitlin and Cisco to help him stop Clyde and other meta-humans. To that end, Cisco gives Barry a suit that will withstand the friction created by his high-speed movements. Tracking Clyde to his old hideout, Joe and his new partner Detective Eddie Thawne, discover both his survival and his newfound powers. Barry arrives, but is overwhelmed until Wells, speaking to Barry through a com-link, coaches him on how to stop Clyde. Though successful, Clyde has a tired Barry at gunpoint. But Joe shoots and kills Clyde before he can kill Barry. Learning about Barry's speed, Joe apologizes for not believing him, and asks him to keep this secret from Iris. With his new powers, Barry runs to help people and vows to one day exonerate his father. In S.T.A.R. Labs, Wells enters a secret room. He rises from his wheelchair, and looks upon a holographic image of a newspaper (published on April 25, 2024) with a headline that reads \\"Flash Missing, Vanishes in Crisis\\".  Production  = Development = On July 30, 2013, it was announced that Arrow co-creators Greg Berlanti and Andrew Kreisberg, its pilot director David Nutter, and DC Comics CCO Geoff Johns would develop a television series based on the Flash for The CW. It would detail Barry Allen's origin. After the announcement, Kreisberg revealed that Barry would appear first as a recurring character in three episodes of Arrow season two, written by Berlanti, Kreisberg and Johns. The third appearance would serve as a backdoor pilot for the new show. Kreisberg added that Barry would be a forensic scientist, and the introduction of his superpower, and his reactions to it, would be very human and grounded. Barry ultimately appears in two episodes of Arrow second season. The planned backdoor pilot was cancelled in favor of a traditional pilot by The CW executives impressed by early cuts of Barry's first two appearances on Arrow. The pilot allowed the creative team to flesh out Barry's story and his world with a bigger budget, as opposed to a backdoor pilot's constraint of incorporating characters from the parent show. The pilot was officially ordered on January 29, 2014, was written by Berlanti, Kreisberg, and Johns, and directed by Nutter. On May 8, 2014, The Flash was officially picked up as a series, with an initial order for 13 episodes. Three more scripts were ordered in September 2014 following a positive response to newly completed episodes by The CW executives. When developing the series' concept, Berlanti said they took inspiration from Richard Donner's Superman films, specifically the \\"heart and humor and scope and Americana\\". When comparing The Flash pilot to Arrow, Berlanti sees the latter as a nighttime crime world, and the former, where the action begins and ends during the day, as more of a sci-fi world. = Casting = alt=Grant Gustin as Barry Allen filming the pilot episode of The Flash. On September 13, 2013, Grant Gustin was cast as The Flash. He began researching the character during the audition process, reading as many comics as possible. Knowing it would be difficult to read everything, Gustin focused primarily on The New 52 series of comics, thinking they were closest to the show's \\"look and feel\\". On January 21, 2014, Jesse L. Martin was cast in the role of Joe West, Barry's adoptive father and police detective. Three days later, Rick Cosnett and Danielle Panabaker were cast in the roles of Detective Eddie Thawne and Caitlin Snow. Carlos Valdes was cast Cisco Ramon on February 14. The announcement also stated that he and Panabaker would first appear in an episode of the second season of Arrow. The same day, Candice Patton was cast for the role of Iris West, Barry's love interest. Tom Cavanagh joined the cast six days later as Harrison Wells, with his role described as \\"a rock star in the world of physics and the mind and money behind Central City's S.T.A.R. Labs Particle Accelerator\\". Cosnett was originally slated to portray Jay Garrick in the pilot before the character was changed to Eddie Thawne. John Wesley Shipp, the actor who played Barry in the 1990 series was cast the following day in an unspecified recurring role. In May 2014, his role was revealed to be that of Henry Allen, Barry's father. Berlanti stated that he was cast because \\"given his history with The Flash, [Kreisberg], [Johns] and I could only think of one person we wanted to play Barry's father and that was John Wesley Shipp. He gives a fantastic and emotional performance in the pilot, and we are looking forward to his presence in many more episodes.\\" = Design = Johns stated that the show's Flash would resemble his comic book counterpart, complete with his trademark red costume, and not be a poor imitation. Kreisberg elaborated: \\"No sweat suits or strange code names; he will be The Flash.\\" While researching the best way to depict the Flash's lightning speed, Johns stated it would not just be the standard \\"blurring around\\". The developers brought in costume designer Colleen Atwood, who also designed the costumes for Arrow, to create the Flash suit. It features a burgundy color scheme, a masked helmet, and gold accents throughout. It went through multiple adjustments from the moment it was created using computer rendering to the day of filming the pilot. Primarily made of leather, the suit has areas with a stretchable material to allow Gustin room to bend. According to Atwood: \\"It was all about a costume that could sell speed, Grant [Gustin] was continually moving in the suit, so it had to be designed to make that all happen visually and functionally.\\" = Filming = The pilot was produced between March 2 and March 25, 2014, with filming taking place in Vancouver, British Columbia; additional filming took place in Portland, Oregon. Comparing how action sequences are shot for the series with those on Arrow, Gustin said: > When [Arrow] shoot[s] action sequences, pretty much what you see is what you > get and they're really doing everything. We do a lot of plate shots that are > empty shots of the area we‚Äôre going to be in and then they‚Äôre putting us in > later in post. I do a lot of the fighting. I don‚Äôt have to do it full speed > and then they ramp it up and a lot of people have to freeze and I keep > moving... It‚Äôs really tedious stuff that we have to do. On theirs, they > learn fight choreography and they shoot it from the perfect angles and what > you see is what you get. = Music = Arrow composer Blake Neely is the series' primary composer, and was selected to score the pilot. He previously composed a theme song for Barry during his two appearances in the second season of Arrow but he noted that: \\"It had to be different... but it also couldn't be so different that it couldn't fit in the Arrow universe, ... it had to be in a style that could hold hands with Arrow.\\"  Release  = Broadcast = The pilot was first broadcast at the Warner Bros. Television and DC Entertainment panel at San Diego Comic-Con International in July 2014 along with the pilot of Gotham and brief footage of Constantine. \\"Pilot\\" then aired in the United States on The CW on October 7, 2014.

Factoring live plus seven-day ratings, the pilot was watched by a total of 6.8 million viewers, becoming The CW's most-watched telecast and the highest-rated premiere among men 18‚Äì34 (2.5 rating).

Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave the episode a \\"great\\" 8.4 out of 10. He felt the show could stand on its own, and complimented Gustin and the cast for their \\"solid\\" acting. He also hoped that future episodes would have \\"more complex villains\\". The A.V. Clubs Scott Von Doviak gave the episode a \\"B+\\" grade noting \\"early indications are that The Flash is perfectly suited to the small-screen environment\\". Calling the pilot \\"this year's best new drama,\\" Andy Behbakht of TV Overmind praised the \\"rich cast of characters\\" portrayed by \\"phenomenal actors\\". He also felt David Nutter's directing was \\"outstanding\\". Chancellor Agard of Entertainment Weekly had a more subdued response. He felt the pilot was promising, but that the characters needed to be \\"fleshed out\\" more. He praised the pilot for embracing time travel from the Flash's mythology. In another review for the same publication, Jeff Jensen gave the episode a \\"B+\\", writing, \\"The series inspires more hope than fear. It vibrates with big-picture vision and has smart fun with its premise\\". He also praised Jesse L. Martin's performance as Barry's dad calling it \\"appealingly flinty and deeply felt\\". Overall he believed, \\"With sustained energy and careful modifications, The Flash should be a long-run kick.\\" Carissa Pavlica from TV Fanatic, gave the episode a perfect 5 star rating out of 5 describing the show as \\"inspirational\\", and Noel Kirkpatrick of TV.com wrote The Flash \\"seems primed to be the most fun show\\" of the TV comic book landscape. The Atlantics Katie Kilkenny called the show \\"a welcome return to the civic hero for DC\\". Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter noted \\"...if you can't smash something like the Hulk does or be a badass in the mold of Batman, you're going to need to make that 'I run fast' thing the basis of jokes and endearment rather than fear and awe\\". He felt the pilot had captured \\"precisely the right mood\\". The Los Angeles Times Mary McNamara thought the show was \\"super-engaging\\" with a hero who is \\"both smart and loved, before and after his transformation,\\" supporting the view that \\"the geek has inherited the earth\\". Matt Roush of TV Guide called The Flash \\"one of the most enjoyable, agreeable and infectiously exuberant new shows of the fall\\". Calling it \\"a welcome respite from the angst-heavy gloom\\" of shows like Arrow and Fox's Gotham. Giving the episode a \\"B+\\", Alan Sepinwall of HitFix liked its \\"lighter and more optimistic tone\\". Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone liked that Grant Gustin added \\"the right touch of hyperactive studliness\\", Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe, giving the episode a \\"B+\\" wrote: \\"All the potential here is in the show's resistance to the joyless atmospherics that have become the bane of comic-book shows and movies. Let's see if they can keep the broodiness at bay and come up with plots that have more than good vs. evil at stake.\\" = Accolades = The episode was nominated for the 2015 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form). Gustin was named TVLine's \\"Performer of the Week\\" for the week of October 6, 2014, for his performance in this episode for \\"[nailing] moments of whimsy, elation, heartbreak, fear and loss ‚Äî all while exuding the kind of rare charisma upon which entire franchises can be built\\". The site praised in particular the scene when Barry puts his new powers to the test and the scene at the prison with his father, calling the latter the episode's \\"most powerful interlude\\".

He was born in Ridgefield, Connecticut. Trained as a doctor, he worked as resident physician at the New York Almshouse. In 1828, after leaving that position, he invented and patented a process for preparing rubber compounds, but was unsuccessful in his attempt market the patent. Howe had seen pins being made by manual process at the Alms House, and began work on a machine for making pins. He received a patent in 1832, and another (#2,013) in 1841. Pins had long made by hand using division of labor, as famously described by Adam Smith in his The Wealth of Nations. Howe's innovation was to mechanize the entire process into one machine: a rotary table, its motion controlled by cams, moved the pins from one station to the next. An 1839 article described the process: The apparatus . . . is one of the most ingenious and beautiful pieces of mechanism in the whole circle of the arts. It is impossible for me to give you any adequate description of it. Those who have any fondness for mechanical ingenuity must see it for themselves. Generally, I may state that the wire from which the pins are to be made is passed in at one end of the machine, cut in the requisite length, and passed from point to point, till the pins are headed and fitted for the process of silvering and putting up. The whole process may be distinctly seen, and as one pair of forceps hands the pin along to its neighbour, it is difficult to believe the machine is not an intelligent being.' American Institute Journal 4 (1838--39): 487. Howe established the Howe Manufacturing Company in 1833 in New York City and moved it to Derby, Connecticut, in 1836. In 1839, three pin machines were in operation, producing 72,000 pins per day. In 1845 it employed 30 men and 40 women and produced pins worth $60,000. Howe's machine-made pins were not, at first, cheaper than hand-made pins, and Howe fought to receive tariff protection to keep British pins out of the country. He retired from manufacturing in 1865 and died in 1876. His grave is in Oak Cliff Cemetery in Derby. Howe's home on Caroline Street in Derby, Connecticut is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as John I. Howe House. References External links *Derby Hall of Fame: John I.

However, a senior member of the SDLP noted that, although he understood Unionism in Ireland, he had no real understanding of Irish republicanism, and no sympathy for it. , Caine had worked for Tom King, Peter Brooke, Patrick Mayhew, Owen Paterson, Theresa Villiers and James Brokenshire. Jonathan Caine has been described as \\"one of the most quietly brilliant Westminster strategists, whose knowledge of Northern Ireland is formidable.\\" In his memoir, For The Record, former Prime Minister David Cameron is quoted in The Yorkshire Post as crediting Caine with being \\"an authority in his field and a tireless behind-the-scenes presence. He was - and remains - passionate about securing peace... in Northern Ireland, and maintaining our United Kingdom.\\" He was nominated for a life peerage as part of David Cameron's Resignation Honours list and was created Baron Caine, of Temple Newsam in the City of Leeds, on 2 September 2016.

The album was released and distributed by MGM Distribution in July 2002. It is the duo's first album released independently after their contract with Mushroom Records ended. Linda Bull said it allowed them more freedom, \\"We've always been conscious of budgets and working quickly anyway, because we didn't want to get in debt or waste someone else's opportunity. But this time we borrowed an amount of money from our mum and dad that we knew we could repay, for the recording, rather than from the record company. Now we're not A&Ring; for radio, we've just made a record we like very naturally. All songs on Love is Mighty Close are written by Australian songwriters. Linda Bull explained all the song writers are their friends \\"I just get on the phone and ring them up, basically. All of those songwriters know what we do musically, so when we ask them for a song they already have an idea in mind of how we‚Äôre going to sing it. It‚Äôs a really easy relationship.\\" At the ARIA Music Awards of 2002, the album was nominated for ARIA Award for Best Adult Contemporary Album, but lost to Nothing But a Dream by Paul Kelly. Critical reception Molly Wishart from The Green Left said \\"All in all, [it's] a good album and well worth a listen. Problem is, Vika and Linda have set the bar so high that good doesn't compare to great.\\" Wishart complemented a couple of \\"enjoyable ballads\\" but adding \\"missing from Love is Mighty Close is the blending of the personal and the political that characterised earlier songs such as \\"Between Two Shores\\" and \\"Grandpa's Song\\".

Browne gained the Libertarian nomination on the first convention ballot becoming the first person to win the party's nomination twice and Art Olivier, former mayor of Bellflower, California, was nominated as his vice president. The ticket had ballot status in all 50 states and in the District of Columbia. Due to a dispute with the Arizona wing of the Party, L. Neil Smith was placed on the ballot instead of Browne. Admitting that he had little chance of winning, he stated that any vote for him instead of George W. Bush or Al Gore was an \\"endorsement, a statement, a declaration on behalf of smaller government.\\" Campaign Browne endorsed letting people having the option to opt out of social security, along with selling off unneeded and unconstitutional federal assets to provide lifetime retirement accounts. He also advocated the repealing of gun laws, the end to the War on Drugs and federal welfare, the complete departure of federal government involvement in health care and education, with a complete repeal of the income tax. He advised for a foreign policy in the vein of Washington and Jefferson, that \\"wishes good will toward people everywhere and is a threat to no other country.\\", with a preference for a stronger defense instead of strengthening the national offense. He advocated for the Internet to be kept free of taxation and censorship.http://www.harrybrowne.org/articles/CampaignPlatform2000.htm From October to Election Day, he made 15 national TV appearances, 18 national radio appearances, 19 local TV appearances, 98 local radio appearances, 40 press interviews, 14 Internet interviews or articles, and 20 speeches, with five articles written and published.http://www.harrybrowne.org/2000/Phillies.htm The campaign had two main goals, related more to the party than the election.http://www.harrybrowne.org/2000/WasItWorthIt.htm *Surpass a million votes for the first time. *Outpoll Pat Buchanan and the Reform Party. However, they failed in achieving either goal. Results Browne received 384,431 votes (0.36%), finishing in 5th place. He received 101,328 fewer votes than he did in his campaign four years prior, while finishing 64,464 votes behind Pat Buchanan and 2,498,524 behind Ralph Nader for third.

He ruled in the Jejakabhukti region (Bundelkhand in present-day Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh). Vijayapala was born to the Chandela ruler Vidyadhara. No inscription from his reign is available. He is mentioned in several Chandela inscriptions, but most of these contain only vague eulogies. For example, the Mau stone inscription declares that he killed all wicked men and put an end to the Kali Yuga. By the end of Vidyadhara's reign, the Ghaznavid invasions had weakened the Chandela kingdom. Taking advantage of this, the Kalachuri king Gangeya-deva conquered eastern parts of their kingdom. A fragmentary Mahoba inscription claims that Vijayapala broke the pride of Gangeya in a battle. The Kachchhapaghatas of Gwalior probably gave up their allegiance to the Chandelas during Vijayapala's reign. This is indicated by the use of high-sounding titles for the Kachchhapaghata ruler Muladeva in the Sas-Bahu inscription. Vijayapala's sachiva (chief minister) was Mahipala, who was the son of Vidyadhara's chief minister Shivanga. The decline of the Chandela kingdom started during Vijayapala's reign. His successor Devavarman was his son from the queen Bhuvanadevi. The Nanyaura copper-plate inscription of Devavarman is dated 1051 CE. This indicates that Vijayapala's reign ended sometime before this year. Devavarman's successor Kirttivarman was also a son of Vijayapala.

Her specialty is birds and she made extensive studies of albatross and their habitats for the British Antarctic Survey. She has written guidebooks on preservation of the flora and fauna of South Georgia and received numerous awards and honors, including the Blue Water Medal, the Fuchs Medal and the Polar Medal for her contributions to understanding the southern polar region. Early life Sally Brothers was born in 1954 to a dentist and grew up in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. Brothers attended Fahan School, graduating in 1970 and then enrolled at the University of Tasmania to further her studies. In 1973 she met Jerome Poncet, a Frenchman, who was sailing aboard the Damien I circumnavigating the globe. She completed her degree in botany and zoology and then joined Poncet in France, where they were married in 1974. The couple made plans to sail on Damien II through the Southern Ocean and set sail in 1976 aboard the 50-foot steel schooner for Antarctica. Career Arriving in 1977, the couple prepared to do a series of population censuses of the wildlife. In 1978, they spent the winter in Marguerite Bay on the Antarctic Peninsula, where Poncet began a survey of the seabirds of the area and a count of elephant seals. The following year, Poncet gave birth to her first son, Dion on South Georgia Island. Their boat had become trapped in the ice and they were forced to wait until a British icebreaker was able to release their schooner. The couple sailed back to Tasmania for repairs, where their second son, Leiv was born in 1981. The following year, they returned to the Antarctic for the 1982-1983 bird season count and settled in the Falkland Islands. Their son Lars Nigel, nicknamed Diti, was born in the Falkland Islands in 1984. Throughout the 1980s, Poncet worked in conjunction with the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) mapping locations of colonies around South Georgia and the Willis Islands of elephant seals, macaroni penguins and mollymawks. In 1987, couple leased a sheep farm in the Falkland Islands and continued to spend up to four summer months each year sailing and studying the wildlife in South Georgia. Poncet spent a decade surveying the birdlife of the region for the BAS. In 1989, the couple were featured in National Geographic (March, 1989) and in 1990, National Geographic Explorer presented a documentary \\"Antarctic Adventure\\", recounting the Poncets' journey to Antarctica and their explorations of the southern polar region. Throughout the 1990s, Poncet continued her collaboration with the BAS, performing vegetation baseline studies. Damien Bay was named after she and Jerome's boat, which had been chartered by the BAS for research. In 2001, concern about damage by tourists to the Cape Royds and Cape Evans areas in which Ernest Shackleton and Robert Falcon Scott had established expedition bases caused the Government of South Georgia & the South Sandwich Islands (GSGSSI) to hire Poncet to prepare an environmental assessment of the region to establish an environmental baseline. In 2002, Poncet began trials on a rat eradication project in an effort to restore the South Georgia pipit population. The brown rat population, originally arriving on the island aboard ships in the 19th century, had caused extreme losses in the petrel, pipit and prion bird colonies. It was the first such trial in South Georgia and a similar project on the Falklands led Poncet in 2011 to the discovery of a new breeding ground of southern giant petrel in the Choiseul Sound. By 2013, the South Georgia project had cleared the area of rodents, when Poncet reported the first pipit nest in Schlieper Bay of the eradication target area. The nest was found near Weddell Point during one of Poncet's expeditions tracking albatross. Since her report, numerous other nest sightings have occurred. Poncet co-authored with Kim Crosbie two editions of the South Georgia Visitor‚Äôs Guide. She has also worked with the GSGSSI as an advisor on reindeer eradication, using humane methods to relocate the invasive species which has caused damage to vegetation. In 2005, Poncet led the Petrel and Prion Survey team in work on a census of the wandering albatross. The count was triggered by concerns over the catastrophic death of the birds because of longline fishing. Between 2005 and 2007, Poncet led a similar count of the giant petrel and white-chinned petrel colonies. As the GSGSSI is committed to performing a survey on the wandering albatross every ten years, Poncet partnered with Cheesemans‚Äô Ecology Safaris in a public-private partnership in 2015 to offset costs of the census. Poncet led the scientific research conducted during the expedition. Awards and honours In 1992, Poncet and her husband were awarded the Blue Water Medal for their years of cruising in the Antarctic and publication of a guidebook focused on preservation of the region. In 1995, she received the Gerdy Jevtic alumni medal from Fahan School. Poncet was awarded the Fuchs Medal from the British Antarctic Survey in 2010 for her wildlife and vegetation mapping and conservation management strategies of the southern polar region. In 2015, she was awarded the Polar Medal for her research and efforts at protecting the biodiversity of South Georgia and the Antarctic.

Burosumab was approved by the FDA for its intended purpose, in patients aged one year and older, in April 2018. The FDA approval fell under both the breakthrough therapy and orphan drug designations. It was approved for use in the European Union in February 2018. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication.  Medical uses  In the United States, burosumab is indicated for the treatment of adults and children ages one year and older with x-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), a rare, inherited form of rickets, and for the treatment of people age two and older with tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO), a rare disease that is characterized by the development of tumors that cause weakened and softened bones. The tumors associated with TIO release a peptide hormone-like substance known as fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) that lowers phosphate levels. In the European Union, burosumab is indicated for the treatment of X-linked hypophosphataemia with radiographic evidence of bone disease in children one year of age and older and adolescents with growing skeletons. XLH is genetic disorder affecting phosphate metabolism within the body, which results in hypophosphatemia. The disease is characterized by overproduction of the FGF23 hormone in bone cells. The FGF23 hormone is responsible for blocking phosphate re-absorption by the kidney and the suppression of the vitamin D dependent phosphate absorption by the intestine. Due to the excess activity of FGF23, phosphate levels in the blood are abnormally low, which affects the constitution of bone. Thus, burosumab is designed to bind to the FGF23 receptor and inhibit the excess activity of the FGF23 hormone within the body. While burosumab is effective for the treatment of X-linked hypophosphatemia, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in England and Wales initially raised concerns regarding the incremental cost-effectiveness of the new treatment but the drug is available through a simple discount scheme.

She worked in many mediums, but is particularly well known for her colourful wooden relief sculptures. Her work was significantly influenced by primitive and outsider art, and created primarily from recycled materials, earning her recognition as an early eco artist. Life Mabel Pakenham-Walsh was born in Lancaster, England, the daughter of Robert Pakenham-Walsh, a prominent psychiatrist. Born with congenital hip dysplasia, she suffered lifelong physical disability; and in 1957, while a student at university, she was badly injured in a major car accident which compounded her disability. Consequently, Pakenham-Walsh campaigned throughout her life for disability rights, especially for children and youths, ultimately leaving a legacy with the Snowdon Trust to assist disabled students in future. Pakenham- Walsh was active in the London arts scene throughout the 1960s and '70s, and befriended many significant figures, including Lord Snowdon, Frances Bond, Martin Leman, Maeve and Mervyn Peake, Wendy Ramshaw, and Tom Stoppard. Pakenham-Walsh also taught woodcarving classes to Further Education students in Kent, England. In the late 1970s she moved to Aberystwyth, Wales, where she continued to create, and became a local legend and beloved eccentric. Education Pakenham-Walsh trained as an artist at Lancaster and Morecambe College of Arts and Crafts (1954‚Äì58) and Wimbledon College of Art (1958-59). The writer and artist Mervyn Peake was an early mentor. Career From the beginning of her career, Pakenham-Walsh created drawings, paintings, and sculptures made almost exclusively from mundane and salvaged materials; this unique strategy was borne of necessity as Pakenham-Walsh encountered \\"social barriers associated with being a female artist in the mid twentieth century, which made it difficult for her [...] to acquire raw materials for her art.\\" Pakenham-Walsh's first published artwork was in the early 1960s when her biro drawings appeared in the literary journal Transatlantic Review. At that time, she was employed as a designer at Pinewood Studios, where she created set- pieces for major motion-pictures, including Cleopatra; she also worked as a sculptor at Shepperton Studios. From 1965 to 1982, she exhibited at the Summer Exhibitions of the Royal Academy of Arts in London. During this era, select London artists rejected abstraction and conceptualism to pursue \\"the depiction of the human figure and everyday landscape\\"; Pakenham-Walsh also sought to depict ordinary daily life, creating art that was both \\"playful and profound [to] invoke the deep time of human nature.\\" Pakenham-Walsh \\"exhibited widely in her lifetime in many art galleries and museums\\" worldwide. Her work has been shown at the Victoria and Albert Museum, and is held in numerous public and private collections, including: the National Library of Wales, the Ulster Museum, Aberystwyth University, and the UK Craft Council; the actor and art historian Vincent Price and the photographer Lord Snowdon also admired and collected her work.

Some of these turrets are higher than they are wide; they have a common base and seem to be arranged in a line. The castellanus characteristic is particularly obvious when the clouds are observed from the side (i.e., from a vantage point on a line perpendicular to the line of orientation). It is a cloud species attached to the cloud genera cirrus, cirrocumulus, altocumulus and stratocumulus. Species of the clouds include cirrus castellanus, cirrocumulus castellanus, altocumulus castellanus and stratocumulus castellanus. Sometimes cumulus castellanus are referred to, but the type is not recognised by the France's national meteorological service M√©t√©o-France, or by the American Meteorological Society and World Meteorological Organisation. Those clouds some would classify as cumulus castellanus typically do not have a common base and are not arranged in a line, thus differing to some extent from the more universally-recognised castellanus types. Some scientists also think that the castellanus should be a full cloud genus, and not just a cloud species. The Federal Aviation Administration implicitly considers a castellanus as a full cloud genus.  Physics  Figure 1: Single cell cumulonimbus of type turkey tower originating from a castellanus having degenerated All castellanus clouds show that there exists an unstable (or conditionally unstable) layer at their altitude but not necessarily under the cloud. Some scientists (Scorer, Corfidi) define a castellanus as a cloud generated by the release of latent heat during the ascension of a saturated thermal column in an unstable (or conditionally unstable) layer at altitude. The cloud will have the appearance of a turkey tower. This unstable (or conditionally unstable) layer can be generated in different ways: (1) a large scale lifting (synoptic scale) that under some circumstances makes the air unstable since the temperature at the base of the layer decreases more slowly than the temperature at the top of cloud due to adiabatic decompression, (2) a cooling of the cloud top that generates the same differential, and (3) an unstable (or conditionally unstable) airmass advection over a stable airmass, etc. Castellanus can arise from clouds formed by either surface-based convection (e.g., cumulus) or elevated convection (e.g., altocumulus). Most of the convection in the towers, however, is due to instability (or conditional instability) at cloud height ‚Äì not to convection below the cloud. The air surrounding the cloud is rapidly entrained into the towers. Cloud physics show that if a cloud does not contain enough humidity, the water vapour contained inside the cloud will only condense at a higher level, where the temperature of the ascending parcel reaches its saturation point. This will consequently dry out the cloud from the base and eventually result in its disappearance if this dry air does not condense below the cloud top. Conversely, if the air surrounding the cloud is nearly saturated and a thick, unstable (or conditionally unstable) layer exists above the initial cloud, convection will be able to continue. Then a tower, that will become wider and wider, will build up that will in some cases become a cumulonimbus. The evolution of a castellanus thus depends on the amount of humidity and the characteristics of the unstable (or conditionally unstable) layer. Scattered clouds in the sky are generally found in relatively dry air with a more humid pocket. If they show such a tall and narrow growth, the dry air surrounding them will not perpetuate the convection which will result in the cloud dissipation. However, a more extended cloud layer shows a higher relative humidity in the layer; a scenario more likely to be associated with overdevelopment of the towers.  Nomenclature  The species castellanus is defined in the International Cloud Atlas, which had its last official release in 1975. It is based on ground visual observation of cloud shape. In practice, the shape of a castellanus is related to the physical process producing it: local instability (or conditional instability) at the top of the cloud that breaks the temperature inversion and is the cause of the formation of towers, this being confirmed by vertical soundings. However, although the species castellanus applies to different genera of convective clouds at different levels, the most current cloud type is the altocumulus castellanus, the base of which is in the medium level. This is reinforced by the fact that pilot's manuals interchangeably talk about either castellanus or altocumulus castellanus, restricting the meaning of the word catellanus. To alleviate this confusion, scientists Richard S. Scorer and Corfidi propose a cloud classification based only on physical criteria obtained from vertical soundings and observations from meteorological satellites to reclassify the castellanus as a cloud genus at the same level as a cumulus or a cirrus. Corfidi has long criticised the resistance from official bodies to this change. However, the 2016 version of the International Cloud Atlas will not change the status of the castellanus. The same scientists have a similar opinion about lenticular clouds that can exist at different levels that are not recognised as a full cloud genus but only as a species. = Criticism specifics = Figure 2: Convective clouds above a cloud layer generated by an expanding outflow of a downburst. View to the south. Scientists note a common confusion between convective clouds generated solely (or at least primarily) by diurnal heating of the ground and the castellanus, which is primarily a product of instability (or conditional instability) at the top of a cloud such as a cumulus, stratocumulus, or an altocumulus, the latter two genera being easily confused. Moreover, the International Cloud Atlas (ICA) is not entirely precise regarding how to determine the genus of a convective cloud. Per the ICA (1975, p. 15‚Äì16), the base of a cumulus cloud is usually between the surface and . This height limit originates from observations in temperate climates where the surface temperature and humidity are about average. It does not take into account how the cloud is formed. In the American West, the base of cumulus clouds can reach , since the combination of a low dew point () and high temperature (up to ) will yield a very high convective condensation level. While the ICA allows that a cumulus cloud can have a base higher than (by saying that cumulus clouds usually have their bases at or below this height), guidance given on page 16 of the ICA could lead to misclassification of a high cumulus cloud. This guidance says that a cloud's genus can be determined \\"by making a choice from among the genera normally encountered in the etage (height range) corresponding to its height.\\" This could lead the observer to rule out cumulus as a possible genus for a cloud that has all the ICA-described characteristics of a cumulus except that its base is above the \\"Low\\" etage (surface to ). The observer, conscientiously trying to comply with ICA classification guidance, might then misclassify this cloud as an altocumulus (perhaps altocumulus floccus), although the instability creating it is at a different level compared to an altocumulus. To complicate matters even further, convective clouds of type castellanus can be generated by updrafts originating at intermediate altitudes with respect to the levels defined in the Atlas; it makes a continuum of possible altitudes. These intermediate-altitude convective clouds will have flat bases except when generating precipitation. Moreover, the altitude of their bases can be higher than the level of condensation by convection or even higher than the level of free convection; it depends on the altitude where the forcing occurs. This phenomenon may occur when a cumulonimbus is in the vicinity. The latter will produce an outflow downstream of the cumulonimbus. The outflow boundary behaves like a pseudo cold front that generates a mechanical forcing where the outflow meets the surrounding air. The lifting enables the formation of convective towers at the level of the top of the outflow in preexisting clouds if the air is conditionally unstable. An example of this phenomenon is shown in the adjacent figure and corresponds to Figure 2 of a paper written by Corfidi; the thunderstorm is located to the east of the picture. The picture's caption in Corfidi's paper refers to the cloud as a castellanus and not as a cumulus mediocris altocumulogenitus as the draft International Cloud Atlas would suggest.  Soaring  Figure 3: Cumulus castellanus. Rocket cloud (that could also be called stratocumulus castellanus) generating no usable lift in soaring Castellanus (clouds made of very narrow columns) are notorious as being unusable by glider pilots. In order for a cloud to have a usable thermal, the updraft column needs to exist under the cloud, in which case the cloud will have a flat base. An altocumulus castellanus, however, can be identified by the lack of a well-defined base. As said above, a hybrid cloud between cumulus and castellanus can be used by a glider pilot. Castellanus that are unfavourable to soaring can be easily identified and are nicknamed rocket clouds. The visual difference between a cumulus and a castellanus is that the former has a flat base while the latter generally has no clearly defined base. However, a visual observation of the cloud may not be sufficient, since in some cases the hybrid castellanus (pseudo cumulus) may have a flat base. The only sure way to distinguish between these two types of clouds is through an atmospheric sounding preceding the flight. If the base of these false cumulus is higher than the convective condensation level, the pilot is probably close to unwanted cumulonimbus. Moreover, when a cumulus breaks down, there may still exist an updraft column under the cloud base that did not originate from the ground. In particular, at the end of the day, the airmass can be stable up to 2000 feet and unstable above this stable layer. The cumulus turn into stratocumulus or altocumulus depending on their height. Before the 1956 version of the International Cloud Atlas, these clouds were called stratocumulus or altocumulus \\"vesperalis\\". Directly under these clouds, updrafts are still present. The meteorologist Corfidi explains that these seemingly innocuous clouds that break down rapidly can be a harbinger of nocturnal thunderstorms. To identify non-ground-based convection, it is possible to compare the height of the base of the \\"cumulus\\" c with the convective condensation level h. This height h is given by the following formula: h = a \\\\times (T - D) where a = 0.125 km / ‚Å∞C; T is the surface temperature and D is the dew point. The variables c, T and D can be easily accessed from a neighbouring METAR. The computation of this height h is based on first principles and therefore is rather accurate. Consequently, if c \\\\gg h, the observed cumulus are almost certainly castellanus under Corfidi's meaning. Then, it will be wise to be wary of the presence of a flanking line or of downbursts in the vicinity. Figure 2 shows such a pattern.

W. Beinecke Professor of Applied Physics at Yale University. He also holds an appointment as the Director of the Applied Physics Nanofabrication Lab at Yale. He is known for his pioneering work on the Josephson quantum electron pump as well as in groundbreaking contributions to initiating the fields of circuit quantum electrodynamics and quantronics. Biography Devoret was born in France. He graduated from Ecole Nationale Superieure des Telecommunications in Paris (1975) and went on to earn his PhD in physics from the University of Orsay (University of Paris-Sud) in 1982, while working in the molecular quantum physics group at Paris. After his doctoral work, he proceeded to post-doctoral training for two years, working on macroscopic quantum tunneling in John Clarke's laboratory at the University of California Berkeley. Devoret's research has been focused on experimental solid state physics and condensed matter physics, with specific emphasis on circuit quantum electrodynamics and a field he and his colleagues initiated, known as \\"quantronics,\\" the study of certain mesoscopic electronic effects in which collective degrees of freedom, such as electric currents and voltages behave quantum mechanically. In addition, his group has been carrying out investigations on single Cooper pair devices for fields such as quantum computation and metrology, and studying amplification, information, and noise in mesoscopic systems. His work in association with well-known experimentalists in the field such as Rob Schoelkopf, Steven Girvin and Irfan Siddiqi has brought about valuable insights in quantum computing and in developing a new paradigm of circuit QED using superconducting electrical circuits. His recent work, in association with a colleague, A. Marblestone, has shown an exponential quantum enhancement in communication channels as a result of entanglement (see Quantum pseudo- telepathy).A.

He edited JAMA from 1899 to 1924. Biography Simmons was born in Moreton-in-Marsh, then moved to Lincoln, Nebraska, when he was 18. After studying at the University of Nebraska, Simmons graduated from Hahnemann Medical College. Hahnemann was a homeopathic program at the time. Simmons later rejected homeopathy. He subsequently graduated from Rush Medical College. He was secretary of the state medical society in Nebraska in the late 1890s. Practicing medicine in Lincoln until 1899, Simmons came to Chicago when he was elected editor-in-chief of JAMA that year. The Chicago Tribune reported that several respected physicians ‚Äì including Chicago physician Bayard Holmes ‚Äì had been considered candidates for the position, but many of them were unwilling to work for the journal on a full-time basis. During Simmons' 25-year term as editor-in-chief and general secretary, the number of JAMA subscribers increased from 1,000 to 80,000. Simmons supported the creation of AMA specialty journals, including the Archives of Dermatology and Syphilology (now JAMA Dermatology) and the American Journal of Diseases of Children (now JAMA Pediatrics). He also created a special council to review drug advertising in JAMA. The council rejected advertisements when it felt like the benefits of a product had not been adequately proven. The AMA underwent reorganization during Simmons' tenure, and he took on the dual role of JAMA editor and AMA general secretary. Dermatologist William A. Pusey recalled Simmons as \\"the leading spirit\\" of the AMA. Pusey commented on Simmons' unique personality, writing, \\"He was a noble character... a man whom his intimates learned to love. He was not gruff or irritable, but he was not easy to know. He did not carry his feelings on his sleeve, but he had deep affection and admiration.\\" Simmons remained the AMA general secretary until 1911, and he retained significant influence within the AMA after that. He served as editor of JAMA until 1924, when he tendered his resignation and was appointed editor and general manager emeritus by the journal's trustees. Upon his retirement, a banquet was held in his honor, and the speakers included William James Mayo and Harvey Cushing. Morris Fishbein, who was Simmons' editorial assistant at JAMA, became his successor.

The episode was written by John Bring and Andrew Dabb and directed by Jerry Wanek. It was first broadcast on February 24, 2016 on The CW. In the episode, Sam and Dean investigate the case of the death of one of their favorite wrestlers, which may involve another wrestler. The episode received generally positive reviews with critics praising the humor and the guest stars. Plot After one of their favorite wrestlers apparently commits suicide, Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) go to pay their respects only for a man at the wrestling show to get murdered with a strange symbol etched into his body. The two quickly figure out that they are dealing with a demon who is collecting souls, but find that none of the wrestlers are possessed. One of the wrestlers, Harley (Mike \\"The Miz\\" Mizanin), is kidnapped by one of his fellow wrestlers, Gunner Lawless (Aleks Paunovic), who is working for a crossroads demon who is collecting souls to create his own \\"nest egg\\" with the appearance of the Darkness and the return of Lucifer. The demon overpowers the Winchesters and orders Lawless to kill Dean. Lawless explains that he had made a deal ten years before and the demon had promised to spare his life if he did its bidding. Dean is able to convince Lawless to help and Lawless frees Dean and kills the demon. Sam and Dean leave as Lawless faces the hellhounds now after him and Dean is now more determined than ever to stop Lucifer and Amara and save Castiel. At the same time, Lucifer (Misha Collins) searches for another Hand of God with no luck. Crowley (Mark A. Sheppard) escapes with the help of another demon and leads her to where he has stashed the Rod of Aaron. The demon turns out to be working for Lucifer, but Crowley expends the Rod's power trying to kill Lucifer and is forced to flee. Reception =Viewers= The episode was watched by 1.85 million viewers with a 0.7/2 share among adults aged 18 to 49. This was a 7% decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 1.98 million viewers from a 0.8/2 share in the 18-49 demographics. 0.7 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 2 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. Supernatural ranked as the second most watched program on The CW in the day, behind Arrow. =Critical reviews= \\"Beyond the Mat\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"great\\" 8.0 out of 10 and wrote in her verdict, \\"'Beyond the Mat' was sort of awkwardly forced on us (the brothers once again had to go do something - anything - due to dead ends and cabin fever), but it still managed to make its own fun. The demon murder plot sort of fizzled, but the Winchester's shared love of wrestling was enough to save it. And The Miz was a good hand too.\\" Hunter Bishop of TV Overmind gave the episode a 2.5-star rating out of 5 and wrote, \\"Jared and Jensen were the best parts, and they made an unremarkable episode bearable. The look Sam gives as a tequila-sloshwed Dean struggles to his feet is priceless. Jensen killed it with his child-like desires at the wrestling match. Jared's line read about Dean describing their jobs was absolutely perfect. This is the most functional episode of TV ever made. It marches towards its conclusion with inevitability, and gets there in a believable fashion. But that‚Äôs about at all it did. It's a long season. They can‚Äôt all be home runs.\\" Samantha Highfill of EW stated: \\"Well, if you were hoping for more of Casifer, you got it. And if you were hoping to watch Sam and Dean fanboy out... you got that, too. Specifically, Casifer said 'phallic,' and Sam and Dean got to remember a time in their childhood when they did something fun with their father. So I'm going to call this week a win.\\" Sean McKenna from TV Fanatic, gave a 3-star rating out of 5, stating: \\"This was a fair episode, but there wasn't really anything that had me overly excited. If anything, I'm pleased to see the Hand of God story continue and glad that Sam and Dean got to have a little fun.\\" MaryAnn Sleasman of TV.com wrote, \\"Nope, nope, nope. 'Beyond the Mat' may have given us fanboy Winchesters, and it may have busted Crowley out of his kennel, but with an awkward ending and a plot that literally went nowhere, I can't say that this was the note Supernatural needed to go out on for its mini-hiatus. It's true that we can't get enough nuggets of Winchester childhood trauma, and the realization that was a nauseating cross between Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, Doomsday Preppers, and Ghost Adventures (or, as I like to call it, Ghost Hunting for Brahs) is both heartbreaking and hilarious, but Sam and Dean's strolls down memory lane have been done before‚Äîand done better‚Äîwith enough frequency that not even our favorite form of filler could save this... this this.\\" Becky Lea of Den of Geek wrote, \\"An episode of two halves, Beyond The Mat manages to succeed more than it fails, but the feeling that the season has been stalling somewhat (Love Hurts was especially guilty of this) continues. Still, it's probably worth it for the sight of Dean trying out his wrestling moves.\\" References Supernatural (season 11) episodes 2016 American television episodes ","title":"Beyond the Mat (Supernatural)"},{"id":"51263417","text":"Sam Meech (born 4 April 1991) is a New Zealand sailor who won a bronze medal at the 2016 Summer Olympics.

The town of La Torre d'En Besora began as an Arab farmhouse, though archaeological investigations later came to believe that there might have been previous Iberian settlement in the area. This settlement was known as \\"Vinrabino\\", and it had a defensive tower, as was common at the time. After the troops of Jaime I of Aragon reconquered these lands, the settlement was renamed \\"Tower of Vinrab√≠\\", and it was subsequently affiliated with Blasco de Alag√≥n, Guillem de Anglesola, and Ramon de Besora. During the time of Besora, he was awarded the Town Charter on January 5, 1274. He decided to rebuild, in part, the tower of the old Muslim farmstead, and added an adjoining fortified manor house next to it. The village which grew around it became known as \\"La Torre d'En Besora\\", Hispanicized as \\"Torre de Embesora\\", and it came to mean \\"Torre del se√±or Besora\\" (tower of Mr. Besora). Over time, the strategic importance of the castle diminished, which led to its abandonment and ruin. Some of its materials were used for the construction of the parish church of St. Bartholomew during the 18th century.

They are mostly found in Gujarat and Rajasthan. They are also found in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chattisgarh and Jharkhand. Etymology The Kansara or Kasera derived their name from kanÃ©su (, ), bell metal. History Their mythical history associates them with Parshurama (sixth avatar of Vishnu) who exterminated the Kshatriyas. It is said that the Kansaras were Kshatriyas who hid their identity by selling utensils to save their lives. Later, selling utensils became their caste occupation. This story is told in the Kalika Purana, named after their deity Kali. Caste groups The Kansara belongs to Gujarat, India. Their associated groups live in Maharashtra such as Tambat. Based on their native place, Kansaras are divided into Gujarati Kansara, Maru Kansara, Sorathia Kansara, and Jamnagari Kansara, Surti Kansara. The Gujarati Kansara live in Wadhwan, Surendranagar, Rajkot, Bhavnagar, and Dhrangdhra. They speak the Kathiawar dialect of Gujarati. They traditionally wear kanthi mala.

Though the film was made on a microbudget, he managed to rope in composer Ilaiyaraaja, to compose the songs and score for the film. Though Ilaiyaraaja has scored for more than 1000 films in various Indian languages, 'Love and Love Only' is the first English film for which he has composed original songs and the complete score. 'Love and Love Only' is a cross- cultural romantic drama between a working class Australian girl and an International student from India, set in contemporary Australia. Julian experimented a new production methodology with a shoestring budget, and a minimal crew which included his whole family, to make this feature film.

The porous boundary of the Caribbean Sea results in this oscillation influencing a mass exchange with the wider ocean, leading to an almost uniform bottom pressure variability over the Grenada, Venezuela, and Colombia basins. These observations are based on satellite observation of the sea-level, monthly means of basin-averaged ocean bottom pressure using GRACE data, tide gauge measurements, and data from a bottom pressure recorder. The oscillation was first found in a numerical modelling simulation, from which is shown one cycle of the least squares fit of (left) sea level and (right) bottom pressure on basin averaged bottom pressure in the Caribbean Sea.One cycle of (left) sea level and (right) bottom pressure in the Caribbean Sea. https://www.youtube.com/v/gj9pB0rI08w?playlist=,&autoplay;=1&loop;=1 Analogy to a whistle Many atmospheric and oceanic phenomena are periodic (for example seasons) and the Caribbean Sea is one such example. However, there is an interesting analogy to the operation of a whistle in the way water flows into the semi-enclosed Caribbean Sea, flows out of it, and interacts within that basin. The net inflow and outflow required to explain the basin-averaged pressure signal is only a tiny fraction (about 1/1000) of the observed changes in flows through individual straits. This means that the bottom pressure signal is a side effect of the oscillating mode operating in a basin which can exchange mass with the wider ocean. This is analogous to the operation of a whistle or similar musical instrument. An organ pipe is a system in which the instability of a jet of air on encountering an obstacle generates eddies, and those eddies interact with the natural acoustic modes of the organ pipe.Jeans, J. (1937), Science and Music, Cambridge Univ. Press, New York. That resonance results in an audible sound in a whistle only because it is open. Such analogy was also invoked by LaCasceLaCasce, J. H. (2000), Baroclinic Rossby waves in a square basin, J. Phys. Oceanogr., 30, 3161-3178, doi:10.1175/15200485(2000)030<3161:BRWIAS>2.0.CO;2. who compared Rossby wave resonant behavior with acoustic waves in a clarinet.

Overview  A procedural image made in Shadertoy with distance fields, modeled, shaded, lit and rendered in realtime Shadertoy.com is an online community and platform for Computer graphics professionals, academicshttp://graphics.cs.williams.edu/courses/cs371/f14/reading/shadertoy.pdf and enthusiasts who share, learn and experiment with rendering techniques and procedural art through GLSL code. There are more than 31 thousand public contributions as of mid-2019 coming from thousands of users. WebGL allows Shadertoy access the compute power of the GPU to generate procedural art, animation, models, lighting, state based logic and sound.  History  Shadertoy.com was created by Pol Jeremias and Inigo Quilez in January 2013 and came online in February the same year. The roots of the effort are in Inigo's \\"Shadertoy\\" section in his computer graphics educational website. With the arrival of the initial WebGL implementation by Mozilla's Firefox in 2009, Quilez created the first online live coding environment and curated repository of procedural shaders. This content was donated by 18 authors from the Demoscene and showcased advanced real-time and interactive animations never seen in the Web before, such as raymarched metaballs, fractals and tunnel effects. After having worked together in several real-time rendering projects together for years, in December 2012 Quilez and Pol decided to create a new Shadertoy site that would follow the tradition of the original Shadertoy page with its demoscene flavored resource and size constrained real-time graphics content, but would add social and community features and embrace an open- source attitude. The page came out with the live editor, real-time playback, browsing and searching capabilities, tagging and commenting features. Content wise, Shadertoy provided a fixed and limited set of textures for its users to utilize in creative ways. Over the years Shadertoy added extra features, such as webcam and microphone input support, video, music, Virtual Reality rendering and multi-pass rendering. There are over 31 thousand contributions in total from thousands of users, several of which are referenced in academic papers.

It premiered on Syfy on July 25, 2015. Plot A-List actor Colton West has an argument with Darren the film director, and storms off in his car. An earthquake hits, and Colton sees the Santa Monica Mountains erupt, spewing lava bombs all around him. A fire spitting spider the size of a man comes out of the car in front of him. Colton runs and drives out of the traffic back onto the main road to escape. Colton arrives home, and tells his wife Olivia about the giant spiders and tells her they need to leave. He takes the shotgun from his house and drives off in his car to find his son Wyatt. Meanwhile, Wyatt is out with his friends Jordan, Eli and Travis when they hear an explosion and see much smoke in the distance, and go to investigate.

He brakes heavily and the spider falls off the front of the bus, after which he runs it over. The front of the tour bus starts dissolving because of the spider's blood being acidic. Colton stops the bus and evacuates it just before it blows up. A spider comes down the chimney in Olivia‚Äôs house but she shoots it. The army starts moving into the city, and they rescue Olivia from her house. Colton gets a lift from his friend, Pirate Jack, a film stunt man. Jack‚Äôs car gets a puncture after hitting a lava vein in the road. Spiders come out of sink holes and chase them into a museum. They meet a scientist in the museum, who is researching the spiders and the volcano. He works out that the spiders were buried in the magma millions of years ago. Because the spiders became active, they are causing the volcanic eruptions, and that the only way to stop them is to kill the Queen spider. A spider gets in through a window in the warehouse where the teenagers are hiding and tries to attack them. Wyatt fights the spider with a fire extinguisher. The girl who was burnt earlier, has a fit and dies. Then loads of baby spiders crawl out of her as she catches fire. The baby spiders then attack Travis, setting him on fire and killing him. Wyatt runs to the roof of the warehouse where he gets a phone signal and texts his location to Colton. The spiders attack the army truck Olivia is in, she hides under a fire blanket as they breath fire inside the truck. The soldiers all get killed and Olivia kills the spider and drives off in the army truck to try and find Colton. Meanwhile, the spiders break into the museum. Jack is killed, but Colton manages to escape. Olivia finds Colton and they drive off to rescue Wyatt. Wyatt climbs off the roof of the warehouse, and is attacked by a spider. Olivia and Colton arrive and run over the spider with the Army truck. Colton realizes that liquid nitrogen can be used to fight the spiders. They all go to the special effects store, where Colton finds his colleagues from the film set. Colton makes a plan to kill the queen spider with a liquid nitrogen bomb, made using items from the special effects store. He leaves with his film crew, to drop the bombs into the queen‚Äôs underground chamber. They plant the bombs around the chamber and detonate them. Many spiders come out of sinkholes to the surface. The film crew shoots them all down. Then, the giant queen spider comes to the surface. Colton uses a jet pack from the film set and flies off a building towards the queen spider.

Early life Martin was born in Four Oaks, Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, on 6 March 1850, son of Patrick William Martin, a leather manufacturer, and wife Mary Anne Bridges. He was educated at the Oratory, Edgbaston, and then entered the engineering firm of Walsh, Lovett and Co in Birmingham. He married Sarah Ann Harrby on 2 April 1869 in Birmingham. In India In 1874 Martin went to Calcutta (present-day Kolkata) to start a branch for Walsh, Lovett and Co. Soon afterwards he founded the firm Martin & Co in Calcutta. The firm took over in 1889 the Bengal Iron and Steel Company, which inaugurated production on a capitalised basis, permitting competition with imported steel and iron. The firm pioneered the construction in India of light railways (which it also managed), to serve as feeders of the main lines. Victoria Memorial, Kolkata Many jute mills in Bengal were constructed by the firm, and up to Martin's death it had the management of the Arathoon jute mills, Calcutta. Three large collieries in Bengal, and the Hooghly Docking and Engineering Company were under its control. The Tansa duct works, providing Bombay (present-day Mumbai) with a constant water supply from a lake forty miles distant, were engineered by the firm. The firm also engineered the water supplies of the suburbs of Calcutta, and of a large number of Indian towns, including Allahabad, Benares, Cawnpore, Lucknow, Agra, and Srinagar (Kashmir). With Edward Thornton FRIBA as principal architect, the firm erected chiefs' palaces and important public buildings in various parts of India, particularly in Calcutta where they were contractors for the Victoria Memorial Hall. Afghanistan Abdur Rahman Khan Early in 1887 Martin was appointed agent by Abdur Rahman Khan, Emir of Afghanistan; he sent to Kabul Thomas Salter Pyne. Pyne, on behalf of Martin's firm, built for the Emir an arsenal, a mint, and various factories and workshops, subsequently introducing, as state monopolies, a number of modern industries. Martin was often consulted by the Emir on questions of policy, and he and his agents were able to render frequent political service to Great Britain. Abdur Rahman selected him to be chief of the staff of Prince Nasrullah Khan, his second son, on his mission to England in 1895. The stay here lasted from 24 May to 3 September, and in August Martin was knighted. Though the Emir's main object in arranging the visit ‚Äî the opening of direct diplomatic relations with Great Britain ‚Äî was not achieved, Abdur Rahman still retained full confidence in him. On his return to Kabul, Nasrullah Khan was accompanied by Martin's younger brother Frank, who succeeded Pyne as engineer- in-chief. Later years In 1889 Rajendra Nath Mookerjee KCIE, of Bengal, became a partner, and shared with Martin's sons, Ernest and Harold, and Mr. C. W. Walsh the proprietorship of the firm. Martin's health was badly affected by the local climate, and he spent much of his later life in Europe. He died at Binstead House, Isle of Wight, on 29 April 1906, and was buried in Ryde Cemetery.

Early life  The son of Moritz Cohn, a Jewish rabbi, and Auguste Cohn, Martin Cohn was born in Reichenbach, Silesia (current-day Dzier≈ºoni√≥w, Poland), which was then part of the North German Confederation. He received a classical education before joining the military. He was discharged in 1894 after suffering an injury to his arm. Moving to Berlin, Martin studied photochemistry under the direction of Professor Hermann Wilhelm Vogel at the Gewerbe Institut.  Berlin years  Martin began working for Georg W. B√ºxenstein at the Georg B√ºxenstein & Company Photochemigraphical Institute, a printing firm. The two men would eventually become close business partners. While working at the Institute, Martin met Colonel On√©siphore-Ernest Talbot, a Canadian Member of Parliament, who was impressed by Martin. Talbot suggested that he should to come to Canada to invest during the rapid colonization of the West. Martin consulted B√ºxenstein, and Martin was provided with $60,000 by German investors to travel to Canada to discover a profitable venture.  Arrival in Canada  On 1 May 1906, Martin arrived in Ottawa to meet with Colonel Talbot. Martin was introduced to Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier, who suggested that Martin should invest in mining. After failing to discover nickel in Northern Ontario, Martin set his sights westward and decided to look for coal in the Canadian Rockies.  Journey into the North Saskatchewan River corridor  Along with geologist Donaldson Bogart Dowling (D. B. Dowling) of the Geological Survey of Canada and Stuart Kidd, Martin journeyed from Morley, Alberta to the North Saskatchewan River Corridor via the Pipestone Pass. The mining expedition discovered coal by the Bighorn and South Brazeau (now Blackstone) Rivers. Martin, who knew virtually nothing about geology or coal mining in Canada, learned quickly from his friend Dowling.  Return to Germany  Martin took a coal sample from the South Brazeau field back to Germany with him to show to his investors. B√ºxenstein suggested they consult an expert on coal, Professor Potoni√© of the Berlin Academy of Mining. Martin's meeting with Potoni√© was a disaster. After claiming that he had discovered coal in the Canadian Rockies, Martin was surprised when the professor adamantly pronounced this to be impossible. According to the professor, the Rocky Mountains were Cretaceous and therefore could not possibly contain coal. Potoni√© pronounced Martin a liar, and Martin dashed out of the room to get away from the incensed professor, who threw the lump of coal at him. Professor Potoni√© was later persuaded to visit Canada to examine the supposed coalfields for himself. He was proven wrong and forced to concede the existence of coal in the Rocky Mountains. In 1909, the company Brazeau Collieries Ltd. was established, named after the South Brazeau River, where they planned to eventually construct a coal mine and community.  Name change and discovery of the Nordegg Coal Basin  In 1909, Martin Cohn legally changed his surname to Nordegg, which roughly means \\"north corner\\" in German. The next year, while hunting by a lake (later named Fish Lake) near the North Saskatchewan River, Martin noticed black, lateral striations in the hillside. Upon further examination, it turned out to be coal. This was quite a discovery for the non- geologist; in fact, two other geologists, D. B. Dowling and James McEvoy, had passed by the coal field numerous times without discovering it. They were very surprised when Martin showed it to them. Impressed with Martin, Dowling declared, \\"We will name it 'The Nordegg Coal Basin' \\". It was later decided that this coalfield should be the first to be developed, due to its closer proximity to Rocky Mountain House than the other fields. By 1912, coal mining operations had commenced.  Founding of Nordegg and Martin's departure  With the completion of the railway between Rocky Mountain House and the mine, the community of Nordegg was established in 1914. One of Martin's business partners, William MacKenzie, named the community in his honour to commemorate the work he did in developing the mine and community. On 28 July 1914, World War I began. Martin began to be viewed with suspicion due to his German ancestry. On 4 June 1915, Martin left Nordegg by request of the Canadian government and spent the remainder of the war in exile in the United States. After the war ended, Martin attempted to re-establish himself in Nordegg. However, Donald Mann and the Lazard Brothers, board members in Brazeau Collieries, voted him out of the company, despite William MacKenzie's wish to reinstate Martin in his former position. Martin therefore sold all the German shares in the company and moved on to live in Ottawa, where he worked closely with the Canadian government to help newcomers get established in Canada. In particular, Martin helped refugees escaping the Nazis before the Second World War get financial footing in North America.  Personal life  While doing sales for Georg B√ºxenstein in England, Martin met his future first wife, Berthe-Marie Brand, in May 1897. On 15 December 1897, the two got married after discovering that Berthe-Marie was pregnant. Their only child, Marcelle Florence Cohn, was born on 20 July of the next year. Happy together for the first few years, their relationship eventually deteriorated as Berthe-Marie's health declined while Martin simultaneously abandoned her for his ventures in Canada. In 1917, while seeing a play in New York City with Berthe-Marie and his daughter, Marcelle, Martin became captivated with one of the female performers. Her name was Sonia Marcelle (an intentional corruption of her original surname, Meisel). Martin eventually married Sonia, shortly after his first wife, Berthe-Marie, passed away on 5 July 1924. Martin and Sonia moved to New York City in 1937. After surviving a heart attack, Martin's health deteriorated, and he died on 13 September 1948.

He was born in Rome into an artistic family. His father was a sculptor.Cowling & Mundy 1990, p. 124. Guidi received his early training at the Scuola Libera di Pittura in Rome and in 1908 began working as a restorer and decorator.Castello di Mesola 1987, p. 102. He continued his studies at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Rome, where he was influenced by Armando Spadini. He had few opportunities to view contemporary French art, and instead immersed himself in the study of artists of the Italian Renaissance such as Giotto, Piero della Francesca, and Correggio, and later masters such as Caravaggio. In 1913 he studied the work of C√©zanne. In 1915 he participated in the third exhibition of the Rome Secession.Rivosecchi During the decade after the war, Guidi painted modern subject matter in a tonality influenced by the Venetians, and gave his figures a timeless appearance by simplifying details of clothing and emphasizing volumes. His painting The Visit (1922), which he exhibited in the Venice Biennale of 1922, is one of his many depictions of two women meeting. The composition is reminiscent of a traditional Annunciation, according to Jennifer Mundy, and \\"marks the end of Guidi's exploration of museum styles and is a confident statement of a new Renaissance-inspired realism in his art.\\" Critical success eluded Guidi until 1924, when he exhibited The Tram (1923) at the Venice Biennale. The painting brought Guidi recognition as a leading artist of the \\"return to order\\". In 1925 Franz Roh termed him one of the new magic realists in his book Nach Expressionismus: Magischer Realismus: Probleme der neuesten europ√§ischen Malerei (\\"After expressionism: Magical Realism: Problems of the newest European painting\\"). Guidi exhibited in the first and second Novecento Italiano exhibitions in 1926 and 1929. In 1927 he married Anita Bernardi, a sculptor. He began teaching at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Venice. In 1933 he visited Paris for the first time. He had his first solo exhibition in Florence in 1932, followed by solo shows in Milan in 1933 and 1936. In 1935 he moved to Bologna. After World War II, his work was increasingly abstract. In 1950 he became associated with Lucio Fontana and the Spazialismo movement.Castello di Mesola 1987, p. 103. From the 1950s onward he produced thematic cycles of paintings, such as Tumulti (\\"Riots\\"), Prigioniera (\\"Prisoner\\"), Grandi Occhi (\\"Big Eyes\\"), Cielo (\\"Sky\\"), and Figure agitate (\\"Agitated Figures\\"). In 1959 he published a collection of poetry, Spazi dell‚Äôesistenza. Notes References *Cowling, Elizabeth; Jennifer Mundy (1990).

The school was founded in 1803 and serves students in grades nine through twelve. Since 1966 it has shared a campus with the town's middle school. The schools are officially known as Lenox Memorial Middle and High School. History The first school master arrived in Lenox in 1770. Lenox Memorial High School has its origins in the founding of Lenox Academy in 1803. Acquiring a reputation for excellence, the Academy drew students from throughout the region and beyond. Already serving as the town's secondary school, the Academy officially became its public high school in 1866. Lenox responded to its growing student population with the construction of the 1908 school building which served as the high school until 1966. In that year a new campus was opened on the eastern edge of the town that co- located the high school and middle school. Lenox High School, 1908 building Academics The school's academic departments include English, Math, Science & Technology, Social Studies, World Languages, Health & Wellness, Drama, Art and Music. There are Special Education and Guidance services and a library and wood shop. Vocational education is not offered. However, a tuition agreement with the Pittsfield Public Schools allows Lenox students to enroll as full- time students in the vocational programs at either Pittsfield High School or Taconic High School. By meeting eligibility requirements, students are able to enroll in free college courses at Berkshire Community College. An independent study option is available too. Student life In spite of the school's small size, numerous after school clubs and activities are available. =publications= There are three publications, including a newspaper,, yearbook and literary magazine. * Lenox Dispatch, newspaper * Xonel, yearbook * Cacophony & Murmur, 9th grade literary magazine =clubs & activities= Many clubs and activities are offered and often are initiated and sustained through student interest. Included among them are: Athletics Lenox sports teams are known as the Millionaires in recognition of the town's prominence as a summer colony for some of the country's wealthiest families during the Gilded Age of the late 1800s. However, many students have expressed dismay with the \\"Millionaires\\" moniker, arguing that it promotes an elitist and revisionist version of the town's history. Numerous efforts to change the sports teams' name have been unsuccessful. The school's colors are maroon and gold. The school competes in the Berkshire County League. The school's chief rival are the Wildcats of Lee High School, in the nearby town of Lee. Sports played in the fall are soccer, crew, cross country, volleyball and golf. Winter sports include alpine & cross country skiing, basketball, hockey and swimming. In the spring the sports are tennis, baseball, softball, crew, track and lacrosse. Boys and girls teams are fielded in most sports. A wider variety of sports are made possible through partnerships with other high schools. These joint team efforts include hockey with Mt. Everett Regional High School, swimming with Monument Mountain Regional High School and lacrosse with Lee High School. Lenox also has a XC team. School regionalization declined Beginning in the 1950s and 1960s, due to projected declines in student populations and more affordable economies of scale, Massachusetts officials began to encouraged smaller school districts to consider entering into regionalized districts with neighboring towns. Lenox held several votes on consolidating with nearby districts in Lee and Stockbridge. While Stockbridge eventually chose to consolidate with Great Barrington, Lenox and Lee have maintained their own districts to this day.Loraine Anderson Devoe & Kathleen Wade Oppermann (1984), Williams High School Alumni Association, History and Directory, 1872-1968, pg. 16, Retrieved August 6, 2016 References External links * Lenox Public Schools * Lenox Memorial Middle & High School Lenox, Massachusetts Schools in Berkshire County, Massachusetts Public high schools in Massachusetts Former school buildings in the United States ","title":"Lenox Memorial High School (Massachusetts)"},{"id":"51264147","text":"In mathematics, the mean value problem was posed by Stephen Smale in 1981. This problem is still open in full generality. The problem asks: : For a given complex polynomial f of degree d \\\\ge 2 and a complex number z, is there a critical point c of f such that :: \\\\left\\\\frac{f(z) - f(c)}{z - c} \\\\right\\\\le K|f'(z)\\\\text{ for }K=1 \\\\text{?} It was proved for K=4. For a polynomial of degree d the constant K has to be at least \\\\frac{d-1}{d} from the example f(z)=z^{d}-d \\\\cdot z, therefore no bound better than K=1 can exist. Gerald Schmieder published a paper in 2003 where he claims to have proven the theorem for this optimal bound of K=\\\\frac{d-1}{d} . Partial results The conjecture is known to hold in special cases; for other cases, the bound on K could be improved depending on the degree d, although no absolute bound K<4 is known that holds for all d. In 1989, Tischler has shown that the conjecture is true for the optimal bound K = \\\\frac{d-1}{d} if f has only real roots, or if all roots of f have the same norm. In 2007, Conte et al. proved that K \\\\le 4 \\\\frac{d-1}{d+1}, slightly improving on the bound K \\\\le 4 for fixed d. In the same year, Crane has shown that K < 4-\\\\frac{2.263}{\\\\sqrt{d}} for d \\\\ge 8. Considering the reverse inequality, Dubinin and Sugawa have proven that (under the same conditions as above) there exists a critical point \\\\zeta such that \\\\left\\\\frac{f(z) - f(\\\\zeta)}{z - \\\\zeta} \\\\right\\\\ge \\\\frac{|f'(z)|}{n 4^{n}} . The problem of optimizing this lower bound is known as the dual mean value problem. See also Notes :A.The constraint on the degree is used but not explicitly stated in Smale (1981); it is made explicit for example in Conte (2007). The constraint is necessary. Without it, the conjecture would be false: The polynomial f(z)=z does not have any critical points.

Pelingotto served in his father's business before he quit and provided as much alms as he could provide to the less fortunate in his area. This led him into contact with the Franciscans which served to open him to a greater plane of servitude to God and the poor. Pelingotto was beatified on 13 November 1918 when Pope Benedict XV confirmed the late Franciscan's local 'cultus' (or popular devotion). Life Giovanni Pelingotto was born in Urbino in 1240 to a rich merchant. Pelingotto began to work in his father's business in 1252 and cared nothing for business like his father did and nor did he care about worldliness of wealth. Instead he preferred to live life as a hermit and he felt called to help the less fortunate in the world so gave to the poor food and clothes as well as other aspects of his wealth. Business efforts were not directed to his own fortune or for profit but for the sustenance and benefit of other people. He lived in rags and wore a rope around his neck to indicate that he was a sinner in need of punishment. His parents worried about his health and had to bring him in from the streets. He became a professed member of the Secular Franciscan Order at the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli and became able to devote his life to greater charitable works with their support and discipline. He travelled to Rome in 1300 for the Jubilee that Pope Boniface VIII convoked. Though he had never been to Rome before the people there were well aware of him. Pelingotto died on 1 June 1304. He was interred at the San Francesco convent in Urbino where numerous miracles were later reported to have occurred. He was later re- interred within that convent itself.

The episode was written by Spiro Skentzos, and was directed by David Straiton. The episode and the rest of the episodes of the season were broadcast on Tuesday nights. Plot Opening quote: \\"They'll kill you, and I'll be here in the woods all alone and abandoned.\\" A man finds mutilated cows in a field and is confronted by a glowing blue skinned Wesen, who inadvertently kills him by pushing him into a fence post. His friend, Robert Hadley (David Bodin) finds him and sees the Wesen escape. Nick (David Giuntoli) meets with Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) to discuss the key and Monroe discovers the key could lead to a site in the Black Forest in Germany. The Wesen is a Gl√ºhenvolk named Vincent (Eric Tiede), who has been mutilating cows to feed their ovaries to his pregnant wife, Jocelyn (Erin Way). Nick asks Renard (Sasha Roiz) about the key's importance. Renard explains that the Royal Families have 4 keys out of 7 needed and are setting out to find Nick's key and the location of the other two, which will lead to a map with something everyone is desperate to find. Nick and Wu (Reggie Lee) investigate the killing, with Hadley stating the Wesen was an alien. The incident catches the attention of George Lazure (Mark Fullerton), who claims to be a ufologist. While Nick and Wu find a piece of the skin of the Wesen, Lazure seems to know about the incident and manages to identify the \\"alien\\" from a witness. Nick learns from the police forensic doctor that the skin contains luciferase, which can make its skin glow. Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) is worrying that her memories are straining her relationship with Nick. She visits Monroe, where she asks him the meaning of Grimm. Not giving details, he explains that Nick sees things that other people can't. Nick asks Rosalee (Bree Turner) about the Gl√ºhenvolk. She says that the species was thought to be extinct and the cow mutilations signal that their ovaries served for a birth. Nick decides to help the Gl√ºhenvolk couple as they could face extinction. They also discover that Lazure is in fact a Wesen hunter and also a Raub-Kondor. Lazure has a gun that fires bullets that contain a drug that kills Wesen but keeps them in their Wesen form for several hours after death. This is to allow him to skin the Gl√ºhenvolk while they are woged. The skin is valuable. Lazure is now following Vincent and Jocelyn to a cottage, but Nick, Monroe and Rosalee get there first. Rosalee helps her give birth. Lazure arrives just after the baby is born. Nick kills him with his own gun while still he is woged. Vincent and Jocelyn leave for Alaska, where many Gl√ºhenvolk are residing. Knowing he is still woged, Nick calls the police to find his corpse, shocking them at first sight. He then woges back to his normal form.

The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"B-\\" grade and wrote, \\"'Endangered' doesn‚Äôt go for the alien abduction or invasion story. Instead, Grimm goes for the rare-and-valuable-endangered-species-on- the-run-and-about-to-have-a-baby plot, mixed with a hunter in disguise. It's a familiar arc, but Bree Turner and Silas Weir Mitchell's performances, amazed and curious with ever-improving chemistry, sell it well. The creatures, who turn glowing blue when agitated thanks to a hormone for bioluminescence (I haven't seen Avatar in a long time, so my below-rudimentary knowledge of this part of biochemistry is practically nonexistent), are on the run from Nebraska, aiming to get to Alaska to meet up with more of their kind. But the female, Jocelyn, is very close to giving birth, leading her partner Vincent with no choice but to mutilate cows in order to harvest their ovaries to feed his partner.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.0 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"'Endangered' was one of the better installments to introduce new viewers this far into the season, thanks a mostly predominant procedural case and light, easy to follow serial elements.\\" Shilo Adams from TV Overmind, wrote: \\"So, aliens, you guys.

Picenardi was born in Mantua into a noble family and, despite pressure to wed a nobleman, insisted instead on pursuing the religious path alongside her sister. Her beatification received ratification on 10 November 1804 after Pope Pius VII issued formal confirmation of her local 'cultus' - or popular devotion and following. Life Elisabetta Picenardi was born in Mantua in 1428 to the nobleman Leonardo Picenardi and Paola Nuvoloni. Her father served as a steward of the Marquis Francesco I Gonzaga. Her sister was Orsina. Picenardi received some formal education as a noble and received her religious instruction from her mother while her father instructed her in Latin. Her mother died sometime during her childhood which left her father to care for her and her sister. In her childhood she lived near the church of Saint Barnabas that the Servite Order managed. Her father would later pressure his daughter into entering in marriage with a noble. Both Picenardi and her sister became professed members of the Servite Third Order in 1448 and Picenardi became noted amongst her fellow religious for her personal holiness and gentleness of spirit which prompted other women to join the Servites. She clothed herself in a hair shirt and would fasten an iron belt four fingers in width to herself which remained until her death. Picenardi recited the Divine Office and would receive the Eucharist often from Fra Barnabas who would also hear her confession. Her father died in 1465. Her sister Orsina was married to the nobleman Bartolomeo Gorni and Picenardi lived with them from her father's death for the remainder of her life. Picenardi died in 1468. Her grave soon became a place of miracles. Beatification Her beatification received formal confirmation on 10 November 1804 once Pope Pius VII ratified her local 'cultus' - or popular devotion.

Personal history Grachat was born in Lisbon, Portugal in 1987. He was born without a left hand. Swimming career Grachat took up swimming as a youth as his parents wanted him to improve his health. He was classified as a S9 swimmer and made his international debut for Portugal in 2005. Grachat made his Paralympic debut at the 2008 Games in Beijing competing in the 50 m and 100 m freestyle S9 events and the 200 m individual medley (SM9). In the 50 m he failed to qualify for the finals finishing fourth in his heat. He performed better in the other events reaching the finals of both. He finished 6th in the 200m and 7th in the individual medley. In 2012 Grachat was selected for his second Paralympic Games, held in London. He entered four events, 50 m, 100 m and 400 m freestyle S9 races and the SM9 200m individual medley. He progressed through only one of the heats, the 400m freestyle, setting a national record of 4:24.10 to finish third in his race. At the final he bettered his own national record with a time of 4:21.94, but this was only good enough for a sixth-place finish. Grachat's first international success came in his favoured 400 m freestyle at the 2014 IPC Swimming European Championships in Eindhoven. There he posted a time of 4.26.61 to win the bronze medal. He bettered this the following year at the 2015 IPC Swimming World Championships in Glasgow where he won his first World Championship medal with a bronze in the Men's 400 metre freestyle.

It is an unofficial remake of the 1991 Game Boy game Metroid II: Return of Samus in the style of Metroid: Zero Mission (2004). As in the original Metroid II, players control bounty hunter Samus Aran, who aims to eradicate the parasitic Metroids. AM2R adds several features, including new graphics and music, new areas and bosses, altered controls, and a map system. The game received positive reviews, particularly for its improved visuals. It was nominated for The Game Awards 2016, but was later dropped from the nominee list without notice. Shortly after release, Nintendo sent DMCA notices to websites hosting AM2R, and download links were removed. Though Guasti planned to continue working on the game privately, in September 2016, he ended development after receiving a DMCA takedown request. Nintendo released an official Metroid II remake, Metroid: Samus Returns, in 2017. Content AM2R is an enhanced remake of the Game Boy game Metroid II: Return of Samus, which follows Samus Aran on her quest to eradicate the parasitic Metroid species from SR388, their home world. The remake is done in the style of Metroid: Zero Mission, adding a map system, new areas, mini-bosses, redone graphics and music, an updated artificial intelligence for enemies, and a log system. Logs give the player more information on Metroids, enemies and the game world after the player has encountered certain enemies or arrived in new areas. The game's controls are less \\"floaty\\" than those of the original and feature new abilities such as grabbing onto ledges, being more in line with the gameplay the series has employed since the Super NES game Super Metroid (1994). The Metroids the player fights have four main evolutionary stages ‚Äì Alpha, Gamma, Zeta, and Omega ‚Äì which have been altered compared to their Metroid II counterparts, including new techniques used in battle; Alpha is the least altered, having only been given a new dodge move, while Omega has been altered the most, having been changed to earth-bound enemies that trap the player. The player confronts these Metroid bosses often and has to defeat 55 of them. Among the newly added bosses are non-Metroid enemies such as a moving statue. Development AM2R was developed by Milton Guasti under the pseudonym DoctorM64 over the course of about ten years, although with several periods of no work done on the game. Guasti wanted to recreate the fast gameplay of Metroid: Zero Mission and the \\"atmosphere and solitude\\" of Super Metroid. After having finished Metroid II for the first time, he imagined it to be \\"cool\\" to play the game with modern gameplay, an in-game mini-map rather than with a physical map on one's lap, and the Omega Metroids as tall as the screen. As Guasti was not a programmer at the time, he used a trial-and-error method to modify a platforming game engine by Martin Piecyk within the game creation system GameMaker, with learning being his main motivation for working on the game. At first the remake followed the original Metroid II map layout and already existing sprites from Metroid: Zero Mission and Super Metroid. As Guasti kept working on the game engine and polished each ability, he felt that AM2R started to seem more and more authentic. After the game had been made public, several artists contacted Guasti and volunteered to create original art for the game; the Metroid evolutions were redesigned, and new enemies and areas unrelated to other Metroid games were added. He remade the music himself while waiting for customers in his recording studio. The added log system was designed to deliver narrative in a non-intrusive way. Because so much was changed in AM2R compared to the original Metroid II ‚Äì with color, a larger screen, \\"less claustrophobic\\" caves, and new gameplay controls ‚Äì Guasti was faced with the challenge of recreating the original's feeling of danger within a more modern style. Metroid II featured \\"tight-quarters combat\\", while AM2R greater amount of screen space and mobility meant that the Metroids' behavior had to be changed. They were made more agile and aggressive, with the intent that players would have to use all tools available to them to defeat them. The scale of the rooms throughout the game world also had to be changed, with some landmarks being redesigned to make better use of the larger screen; some, however, were kept similar in size to their Metroid II counterparts. While the game's first areas were made colorful and accurate to their counterparts in Metroid II, later areas were expanded and introduced new elements, featuring progressively darker caves, tighter passages, and Metroids found in more dangerous locations. This, along with increasingly darker and menacing music, was to recreate the feeling of Metroid II, which Guasti described as \\"being lost in a dark, mysterious cave without knowing what's ahead\\". In the latter parts of the game's development, the largest challenge was to coordinate Guasti's and his collaborators' work; when Guasti started working as a programmer, he learned about project management and applied it to AM2R, but still found it challenging to have deadlines and keep people motivated, as everyone was working on the game free in their spare time. In late 2014, the project was ported to the newer version GameMaker Studio, which enabled improved loading times and performance, but required the complete rewriting of some features and changes to the designs of some levels. This move also made bugs faster to fix and new builds easier to make, leaving the development progress in a more expedient and productive state. Later in the same year, the developers worked on improving the visuals, giving the fourth area a new graphics tile set intended to give it more personality.  Release  Guasti released a first demo in late 2011 and another in early 2013. The full game was released free following a countdown through its website on August 6, 2016, coinciding with the Metroid series' 30th anniversary. Updated versions with further improvements and features were planned, but shortly after the first release, Nintendo sent DMCA notices to websites hosting it. The download links on the game's website were removed on August 7, but Guasti said that he planned to work on the game privately. He said he understood Nintendo's need to protect its intellectual properties and encouraged AM2R players to buy the official Nintendo eShop release of Metroid II. On September 2, Guasti received a DMCA takedown request from Nintendo and announced that he had ended development. He released the soundtrack later that month, including several tracks intended for the unfinished version 1.2 update. Development of the game was continued by people from the Metroid fan community, including bug fixes, new enemies and story elements, and additional game modes such as New Game+, and a \\"Randomizer\\", which shuffles the locations of power-ups. Nintendo released an official remake of Metroid II, Metroid: Samus Returns, in 2017. A year after the release of AM2R, Guasti announced that he had been hired by Moon Studios to design levels for Ori and the Will of the Wisps. He also announced a project made in Unity 3D. Reception Mike Fahey, writing for Kotaku, called the game brilliant and compared the gameplay, graphics, and music favorably to their Metroid II counterparts. Siliconera Ishaan found the game impressive and said that it stands out from other fan-made remakes. Sam Machkovech at Ars Technica said that the game would be a delight to people who liked Zero Mission, and that its quality and amount of polish put it on par with Nintendo's games. Zack Furniss of Destructoid liked the game to the point that he thought Nintendo should use some ideas from it in future Metroid titles. Jonathan Holmes, also at Destructoid, said that AM2R does a good job at filling the \\"void\\" left by Nintendo's lack of new 2D Metroid games, calling it \\"even more of an extensive re-imagining than Metroid: Zero Mission was to Metroid 1\\". Gon√ßalo Lopes at Nintendo Life said that the game was a great way to celebrate the series' 30th anniversary and a dream come true for Metroid fans, and that he imagined people would be willing to pay money for it if sold on Nintendo's eShop. Matthew Castle at Nintendo Gamer called it an example of how to do a remake right. Tom Sykes at PC Gamer praised AM2R as a \\"great game in its own right\\" regardless of whether one had played Metroid II prior or not. NF Magazine Tony Ponce initially worried that the game would lose the \\"eerie charm\\" of Metroid II, but found it to be able to keep a high-tension feeling, as well as including new things for longtime fans of the original. Furniss found that the gameplay changes compared to the original Metroid II, such as the ability to grab onto ledges, all felt natural, and called the user interface \\"sleek\\". He liked the log system, calling it one of the biggest additions, and enjoyed how the opening added more story content while not being \\"overdone\\", instead feeling like the opening to Super Metroid. Holmes commended the boss battles, calling them \\"arguably\\" the best across all 2D Metroid games. Ponce found the precise win conditions for Metroid battles annoying considering how often they are fought, but similarly thought that the new non-Metroid bosses were among the most exciting and challenging in all 2D games in the series. His favorite new gameplay elements were the \\"gimmicks\\" such as the player-operated tunneling drill machine and the walker robot minigame. Machkovech said that the game looks \\"phenomenal\\" and that its \\"beautiful, easily discernible sprites\\" and 60-frames-per-second animations made it look modern despite the 320√ó240 resolution. He particularly enjoyed the game's color palette, saying that it made AM2R feel like a completely new game. Furniss called the game \\"gorgeous\\", praising the colors and the increased graphical detail. Alec Meer at Rock, Paper, Shotgun said that the game looked lovely, and that it was a large improvement over the Game Boy version's green screen. Jeffrey Matulef, writing for Eurogamer, found it impressive how closely the game resembled Super Metroid visually. Fahey noted the soundtrack in particular as being of high quality, and Lopes called the music \\"fantastic\\". The game was nominated for The Game Awards 2016 in the \\"Best Fan Creation\\" category, but was removed from the nomination page without notice alongside the fan game Pok√©mon Uranium. The Game Awards host Geoff Keighley explained that AM2R and Pok√©mon Uranium were not legally cleared by Nintendo to be included in the event.

The film tells the story of a largely female rock band who acquires an unpublished score by composer Niccol√≤ Paganini and decides to record it. When the band films a music video for the song in Paganini's ancient home, it awakens the spirit of the deceased composer and unlocks a portal to Hell. Plot At La Casa di Sol, an ancient Venezian home of various composers through the ages, a young violinist practices a piece by Paganini and then inexplicably electrocutes her bathing mother with a hair dryer. We then see a female rock band recording in a studio who are told by their manager, Lavinia, that they should find a new song. The drummer, Daniel, travels to a secluded location, where he meets with Mr. Pickett, who sells him an unpublished score by Paganini. Daniel demonstrates the new piece, \\"Paganini Horror,\\" for Lavinia and the lead singer, Kate, and explains its origins, with all three agreeing to record it. Lavinia suggests they employ famed horror director Mark Singer to film a video and Kate suggests they film at La Casa di Sol, with Lavinia adding that she knows the current homeowner, Sylvia. On the video shoot for their new song, Sylvia reveals the legend that Paganini himself once resided in the house and murdered his bride, Antonia, there. Meanwhile, Pickett travels to St Mark's Campanile, where he throws the money Daniel has given him off the roof and invokes Paganini's curse. Rita, the bass player, is confronted in the dressing room by Paganini, who she assumes is Daniel wearing his costume from the video shoot; however, he stabs her to death with a violin. Sylvia and Elena, the guitarist, announce that Rita has vanished; Lavinia suggests she be replaced, while Mark suggests they finish the video using mannequins. While going to collect the mannequins, Daniel sees Rita and is summoned by her to another room, where he is murdered by Paganini. Sylvia finds Daniel's ring atop a human-shaped pile of ash. They decide Daniel has played a joke on them when the ground opens beneath Kate's feet and she falls. As Mark tries to help her out of the hole, he is electrocuted, dropping Kate into the hole. Mark and Elena are driven from the house by deafening sounds, but when they try to escape, their car hits an invisible barrier, ejecting them from the car and engulfing it in flames. Lavinia finds a tunnel in the hole and descends to try and locate Kate. Elena and Sylvia hear Lavinia scream, but Elena believes the scream came from upstairs, which leads Sylvia to investigate, leaving Elena to fend for herself. Sylvia, hearing ghostly violin music, ascends the stairs, and as she reaches the top she sees Daniel outside in the courtyard. After quickly descending the stairs and exiting the house to greet him, only to find he has vanished, she discovers a bewildered Kate in the empty courtyard pool and the two agree to find the others and escape. Lavinia finally emerges from the hole and reunites with the others, realizing Elena has now gone missing. Following a trail of blood, they ascend the staircase and find a dying Elena, covered in blood and gasping for air. Lavinia recognizes the fungus on Elena and says it was found on logs during the 18th century, with the wood being used to make Stradivarius violins. Kate, resolving that the only way to rid the house of the curse is to use Paganini's piece as a weapon, plays the melody on her violin. However, when they attempt to escape the house, they find that the invisible barrier is still in place. Kate decides the curse could be lifted by playing the piece backwards, but when Kate attempts this, the sheet music electrocutes Lavinia and flies out of her hands, bursting into flames. Lavinia then finds herself trapped behind an invisible wall, which crushes her to death. Paganini emerges, stabbing Sylvia with his violin and sealing the unconscious Kate in an empty double bass case. As he plays his violin, Kate awakens inside the case, which catches on fire. The sun rises and emerges through the open window, killing Paganini and reducing him to a pile of dust in the shape of a treble clef, while incinerating both the sheet music and his violin. Kate exits the house as Sylvia, thought to be dead, arrives by car and explains that, because Kate never played the piece backwards, Paganini's curse will continue. Pickett emerges from the car as Sylvia explains that she was the one who, as a child, had murdered her mother in the house, and that she was condemned to relive the experience for eternity. Meanwhile, Pickett explains that all visitors to the house have already been condemned to Hell. As a new family arrives, Kate theorizes that she is free to go, but Pickett explains that he hates people who sell their souls for fame and success and stabs her to death. Cast *Daria Nicolodi as Sylvia Hackett *Jasmine Maimone as Kate *Pascal Persiano as Daniel *Maria Cristina Mastrangeli as Lavinia *Michel Klippstein as Elena *Pietro Genuardi as Mark Singer *Luana Ravegnini as Rita *Giada Cozzi as Sylvia (child) *Elena Pompei as Sylvia's mother *Donald Pleasence as Mr. Pickett Production The development of Paganini Horror was based on the premise that the film Paganini, a pet project of actor Klaus Kinski, was going to be a great success. Cozzi came up with the title for the film and producer Ugo Valenti hired Enzo Sciotti to illustrate a poster for the film, after which a script began to be developed. Cozzi's original screenplay included references to the violinist Paganini, as well as elements of Cozzi's favourite genre, science fiction. Paganini Horror was originally going to be filmed in Colombia, where Cozzi's previous film, Contamination, had been shot, and the original premise featured a haunted house where time constantly fluctuates, changing a person's age. However, Valenti did not like Cozzi's script, which led to Cozzi continuously changing it until Valenti eventually left the film industry. Cozzi then enlisted Daria Nicolodi to help with the screenplay, borrowing ideas from a television series he had worked on titled Turno di notte. Cozzi then found producer Fabrizio De Angelis, who expressed his interest in the film. A few days before filming, De Angelis told Cozzi to scrap the gory scenes in the film, as the budget would not allow them, which led to Cozzi rewriting parts of the script to include more fantastical scenes in their place. Cozzi later conveyed his frustration with De Angelis, stating, \\"There I was with this beautiful ambitious script and they handed me a 16mm camera, gave me a villa to start shooting in and said 'Start Shooting'! In conditions like these, not even the best director in the world could have done any better.\\" The film was shot in three and a half weeks on location in Venice and at R.P.A. Elios Studios in Rome. Release Paganini Horror passed Italian censors on 24 January 1989 and was distributed in Italy by Fulvia Film on 6 June 1989. Film critic and historian Roberto Curti stated that the film performed poorly at the Italian box office. =Home media= On 16 September 2019, UK distributor 88 Films released Paganini Horror on Blu-ray, featuring a 2K remaster of the film from the original 16mm camera negative. On October 29, U.S. distributor Severin Films also released the film on Blu-ray, with the first 3,000 copies including a CD of the film's soundtrack.https://severin- films.com/shop/paganini-horror-le-blu-ray Reception In his book Italian Horror Film Directors, Louis Paul retrospectively noted that \\"nobody likes Paganini Horror, Cozzi included.\\" In his book Horror and Science Fiction Film IV, Donald C.

It states that players must have their hair cut above the collar of their baseball jersey and no beards are permitted. The policy has raised some controversy and there have been calls for its abolition.  History  The policy was started in 1973 by former club owner George Steinbrenner, reportedly after seeing several players' hair covering their numbers during performance of the \\"Star Spangled Banner\\" and noting down their numbers (as he did not know their names) to instruct them to cut their hair. As a result, he introduced an appearance policy for the Yankees. The official policy states \\"All players, coaches and male executives are forbidden to display any facial hair other than mustaches (except for religious reasons), and scalp hair may not be grown below the collar. Long sideburns and 'mutton chops' are not specifically banned.\\" This was because Steinbrenner wanted the Yankees to adopt a corporate attitude. The appearance policy may have been inspired by Steinbrenner's veteran status with the United States Air Force, which like other military branches also has a similar appearance policy. The policy raised some objections from the team. Don Mattingly openly defied the Yankees' management's requests for him to cut his hair. In response they removed him from the starting lineup and fined him repeatedly until he promised to trim it. An incident that had mirrored a story in the January 1992 The Simpsons episode \\"Homer at the Bat\\" where Mattingly was a guest star and was benched in the episode for having long sideburns (that only Mr. Burns, the team manager, could see) was written months before the Yankees incident. Lou Piniella challenged the rule during spring training in Fort Lauderdale, citing that Jesus had long hair. Steinbrenner responded to this request for exemption by pointing at the nearby swimming pool and saying \\"If you can walk on water, you can wear your hair any way you want.\\" The policy has become a prominent symbol of the New York Yankees. An example of the symbolic clean-shaven look came when Johnny Damon cut his \\"caveman\\" hair and beard when joining the Yankees from the Boston Red Sox with Steinbrenner commenting \\"he looks like a Yankee, sounds like a Yankee, he is a Yankee\\". This policy has led to media speculation that when a player cuts his hair, he is going to sign with the Yankees. One example of this was San Francisco Giants' Tim Lincecum. Some players, such as David Price, have openly stated that they would never join the Yankees as long as the policy was in place.  Calls for abolition  There have been several calls for the New York Yankees to drop the policy. The New York Yankees players themselves skirted around the policy in 2015 by adopting the practice of growing moustaches in line with the wording of the policy. Manager Joe Girardi stated that he would join the players if they won 10 in a row. This was despite Girardi stating that he would continue Steinbrenner's policy after Steinbrenner had died.  Other clubs  Other baseball clubs also had an appearance policy. Until 1972, there were no MLB players that had facial hair due to fashion dictates at the time. The Cincinnati Reds had a policy against beards as an unwritten rule until 1999. Before the ban was lifted, the Reds had no players with facial hair since 1902. In 2016, when Mattingly became the field manager of the Miami Marlins, he introduced a complete ban on any facial hair on any players. However, Mattingly's facial hair policy came under scrutiny, as observers noted it bore too great of a resemblance to what Simpsons character Mr. Burns wanted from him in his 1992 Simpsons guest appearance.https://deadspin.com/don-mattinglys- marlins-take-a-lesson-from-mr-burns- ba-1760453246https://www.smh.com.au/sport/miami-marlins-coach-don-mattinglys- new-facial-hair-policy-echoes-episode-of-the- simpsons-20160222-gn0pdd.htmlhttps://fansided.com/2017/05/07/don-mattingly- never-seen-homer-bat-still-gets-checks/ In 2017, the policy was abolished.

During the twelve Nazi years her political activities became illegal and she spent much of the time in state detention, which she survived. Life C√§cilie \\"Cilly\\" Barbara Tannenberg was born in Friedberg, a small manufacturing town north of Frankfurt. Her father, Friedrich August Gustav Tannenberg, was a shoe maker. There were four siblings. After leaving school she trained and qualified for work in the garment industry. Influenced by the impact of the war, in October 1918 she became an organiser locally with the Young Socialists. In 1920 she joined the Independent Social Democratic Party (\\"Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / USPD) which had broken away from the mainstream Social Democratic Party the previous year, primarily over disagreements on whether or not to support funding for the war. At the end of 1920 the USPD itself split apart, and Cilly Tannenberg was part of the majority faction that now joined the newly formed German Communist Party. In Friedberg, on 25 June 1921 she married whom originally she had met through their membership of Friends of Nature organisation. He was a master tailor and, as a German Communist Party member, a local councillor in Bad Nauheim. The two of them moved to Bad Nauheim and Cilly became an honorary (unpaid) Communist Party official, while the two of them worked together in the tailoring business. Later, in 1927, Jakob Sch√§fer became a member of the regional legislature (\\"Hessische Landtag\\"). Cilly Sch√§fer herself was elected a member of the Landtag in 1931. In January 1933 the political backdrop was transformed when the Nazi Party took power and converted Germany into a one- party dictatorship. Political activity - except in support of the Nazi Party - became illegal. At the end of February 1933 the Reichstag fire was instantly blamed on the Communists, and in March 1933 those identified as Communists began to be arrested. Cilly Sch√§fer was arrested on 13 March 1933 in Bad Nauheim. On 5 April a special court in Darmstadt sentenced her to a year in prison. Her husband was taken into \\"protective custody\\" in June 1933 and spent time inside Osthofen Concentration Camp. They were both released in the summer of 1934 and relocated to Marburg where they were able to support themselves through tailoring. Cilly Sch√§fer continued to be involved in low level resistance activity, distributing the now illegal Communist Party newspaper, Die Rote Fahne (\\"The Red Flag\\") and using the subversive \\"Red Front\\" greeting when meeting comrades in the street. It is known that for several weeks in 1935 she was held in \\"protective custody\\". In 1940 a birthday party was held at the Sch√§fers' Marburg home which was no party, but a meeting (by definition illegal) of Communist Party officials. The attempt to assassinate Hitler on 20 July 1944 failed in its primary objective, but it did greatly unsettle the Nazi leadership. Some years earlier the Nazis had compiled a list of communist and socialist politicians and activists from the Weimar years who might be rounded up in the event of a deterioration in the domestic political situation. By 1944 the list was somewhat out of date, many of those named on it having already been murdered or died from natural causes, but Jakob and Cilly, whose names were also on the list, were very much alive: overnight on the third weekend in August they were arrested and taken, in the first instance, to Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp. Cilly was subsequently moved to Oranienburg concentration camp and set to work in a munitions factory. According to one source she was then moved again, now to Sachsenhausen concentration camp, in order to avoid the intense aerial bombing of Berlin. A different emphasis comes from another source which states that in April 1945 she was one of a group of concentration camp inmates sent on one of the notorious death marches. She managed to escape back home to Hesse. By early May 1945 Nazi Germany was over: Cilly and Jakob Sch√§fer now settled back in Marburg which was being administered as part of the US occupation zone. In Marburg she worked in the all-party Women's Committee, one of the first public associations to be approved by the US military authorities. The organisation concerned itself with practical reconstruction and the distribution of food parcels to the destitute. She also led a sewing workshop in one of the city schools and became a volunteer official of the no longer illegal Communist Party. By May 1949 basic democratic structures had been restored and the US occupation zone, merged with the British and French occupation zones, was relaunched as the US sponsored German Federal Republic (West Germany): in 1951 Cilly Sch√§fer and her husband were both voted on to the local council (\\"Marburger Stadtparlament\\"). She was also a founder member of the Marburg branch and an active participant in the Union of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime (\\"Vereinigung der Verfolgten des Naziregimes\\" / VVN). During the 1950s, partly in response to economic success in West Germany and partly as a reaction to the increasingly confrontational approach taken by the authorities in the former Soviet occupation zone, which had been reinvented in 1949 as the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), support for the Communist Party fell away dramatically in West Germany: in August 1956 it was banned by the West German Constitutional Court. In 1968 it was reconstituted and relaunched, now identified as the German Communist Party (\\"Deutsche Kommunistische Partei\\" / DKP). It never regained the levels of support that the former communist party had enjoyed across Germany before 1933, but in 1968 Cilly and Jakob Sch√§fer were among the first to sign up to the \\"new\\" German Communist Party. Cilly Sch√§fer was widowed in 1971. She herself died in Marburg on 18 January 1981, one week short of what would have been her 83rd birthday. In 1988 the house where she had lived with her husband, officially known at the time as the \\"Jakob-Sch√§fer-Haus\\", was renamed as the \\"Cilly-und-Jakob-Sch√§fer-Haus\\". A street was named after her. All this appears to have come about because, among opinion formers in the city, an exhibition focusing on women in the Landtag (regional legislature) increased awareness of Cilly Sch√§fer's contribution.

The Venetians wanted to name it St. Mark's Square but in the end it became known as \\"The Bell Square\\" because of a tower that to this day rises higher than all surrounding buildings and bears a clock and metal structure with a bell suspended from it. History The Bell would sound every hour and half hour and also signified the start and end of all important activities in the town at a time when few citizens had their own time-telling devices. It was also used to announce major festivities (i.e. national celebrations and election victories), while it has been recorded that on several occasions the bell cracked from the simultaneous mechanical and manual ringing by enthusiastic locals. The arched entrance of the clock tower was until 1900‚Äì1910 decorated with a relief depiction of a handshake: this was the medieval emblem of Kefalonia and was used to decorate all public buildings of the time. Throughout the duration of the British occupation a clock winder had been appointed to tend to the clock's proper operation. The clock remained in good working condition until the mid 1920s, when it fell into disrepair. On August 12, 1953 the island was struck by the catastrophic Ionian earthquake and the Bell Tower collapsed. The bell was later found buried in the ruins, yet intact. The Tower was rebuilt by donations initiated by a Kefalonian woman, the bell put in place and in 1985 the clock operated for the first time since the earthquake. The Kampana Caf√© An image of the Kampana (Bell Tower) Cafe entrance in 2016. The Cafe has been shut down since 2013 and the historical building is no longer accessible to the public. The Kampana Cafe (\\"Bell Tower Cafe\\") was established in 2000 by the \\"KOI.S.P.E. Rota\\" social enterprise for the purpose of offering employment to unemployed youths and disabled citizens by means of the \\"PEIRAN\\" programme and the EU Initiative \\"Employment Horizon\\"http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/ECDB/equal/jsp/dpComplete_1070.htm for the Region of the Ionian Islands. The cafe was accommodated on the ground floor of the Bell Tower. It operated as a traditional cafe with local refreshments and sweets, while the traditional products prepared by the cafe's employees were also sold on the premises. The cafe also served as an entry point for visitors to the historical building and the clock at the top of the Tower. In May 2013 the Municipality of Kefalonia decided to cease operation of the cafe on the pretext that the social enterprise was no longer viable due to accumulated debt. The issue was in the headlines of the local media for weeks afterward, while a petition was filed with the European Parliament against the Municipality of Kefalonia for failing to cater to the needs of disabled persons on the island. The Cafe remains closed and the Bell Tower is no longer accessible to visitors.

He was the President of the Olympic organising committee for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin.  Early life  Lewald was born in 1860; his aunt was Jewish novelist Fanny Lewald. Lewald became a civil servant in Prussia in 1885, and became the acting Reich Commissioner in 1903. In that role, Lewald attended the 1904 Worlds Fair (held along with the Olympic Games), where he disagreed with Kaiser Wilhelm II over whether the Deutscher Olympischer Sportbund, of which he was the President, should be politically independent. After Berlin won the right to stage the 1916 Summer Olympics (which were later cancelled due to the outbreak of World War I), Lewald encouraged the German Reich to invest in the games, arguing that it was comparable to a World Trade Exhibition. by the end of World War I Lewald was so well connected as the highest civil servant of Imperial Germany that he personally wrote the abdication speech of the last imperial government. At the time of the Kapp Putsch Lewald was the acting Head of Government as all ministers had left Berlin. He refused being forced at gun-point to provide government funds for the revolting military.Arnd Kr√ºger and Rolf Pfeiffer: Theodor Lewald und die Instrumentalisierung von Leibes√ºbungen und Sport. In: Uwe Wick and Andreas H√∂fer (eds.): Willibald Gebhardt und seine Nachfolger. Aachen: Meyer & Meyer 2012, 120‚Äì145. Lewald, a conservative, was getting into more and more difficulties with the Social Democratic governments and eventually retired from Civil Service in 1923, but stayed on in more that ten honorary positions, e.g. in charge of German international student exchange, the board of several prominent museums and the National Olympic Committee; he had been the under Secretary of State. In 1935, Lewald recommended that Pierre de Coubertin be awarded a Nobel Prize.  1936 Olympics  Lewald with Julius Lippert and Avery Brundage at the 1936 Summer Olympics Lewald became a member of the International Olympic Committee in 1926, and was one of three Germans on the Committee that awarded Berlin the 1936 Summer Olympics. Lewald had previously argued for Germany to be allowed to attend the 1928 Summer Olympics, after being banned in 1920 and 1924. In November 1932, Lewald gained permission to create an independent Organising Committee for the Games, which was created in January 1933. Immediately after the Nazis won the 1933 federal election, he spoke to Joseph Goebbels about the propaganda value of the event. Lewald was later removed from his post and replaced by Hans von Tschammer und Osten as Lewald's paternal grandmother was Jewish, although Lewald himself was a Christian; the IOC demanded unsuccessfully his reinstallation to the role in a meeting of June 1933. Instead, Lewald was given a ceremonial advisory role, and he gave a formal speech at the opening of the 1936 Summer Olympics, although he also protested the treatment of German Jews during the Games. Lewald had previously assured the IOC that German Jews would not be excluded from the Games. The Olympiastadion in Berlin that was built for the Games contained an Olympic bell, which Lewald had suggested, and Lewald also suggested one of the designs for the Olympic torch, as well as getting the IOC to approve the torch route from Olympia to Berlin. After the Games, Sigfrid Edstr√∂m nominated Lewald to be Vice-President of the IOC, although Lewald withdrew and resigned his IOC role in 1938 after pressure to do so from the Nazi Party.

Members of the Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic shot him while trying to escape from East Germany.  Biography  He was his mother's only child, and grew up with her in Naumburg. His father is unknown. After school, he trained as a car mechanic. In Naumburg he took a job at the Deutsche Reichsbahn (East Germany).Portrait of Christian-Peter Freise at chronik-der-mauer.dePortrait of Christian-Peter Freise at berliner-mauer-gedenkstaette.de Memorial Plaque at Kiefholzstra√üe 100, Berlin-Pl√§nterwald commemorating Christian-Peter Friese, along with Wolfgang Gl√∂de and J√∂rg Hartmann  Death  On the evening of December 24, 1970, he left his home and his mother without saying goodbye or leaving a message. He went to East Berlin by train. Once there he went to the allotment Vogelsang II in Treptow which was right on the border. He watched the border and climbed around midnight on the interior fence. He triggered alarm by touching the subsequent signal fence. A total of five border guards opened fire on Christian-Peter Friese, who took cover in the vehicle barrier ditch. Shortly afterwards Friese began again to run in the direction of the last border fence. He was hit several times in the legs and upper body. He succumbed to his injuries in the death strip. In the crime scene sketch of the files of the Stasi were recorded a total of 98 shots on Christian-Peter Friese.  Aftermath  A senate speaker and the American City Commandant expressed their protest over the incident. The West-Berlin police initiated an investigation. The mother of the deceased was informed on January 7, 1971, by members of the Stasi about the death. The legend was that Christian-Peter Friese was traveling by car into a tree. The body had been cremated. The urn was transferred one month later to Naumburg and buried there in the municipal cemetery, under the supervision of the Stasi. After the German reunification, the mother said to Naumburg police that her son revealed his intention of fleeing. In a Mauersch√ºtzenprozess (process against guards of the wall who had shot) the border guards involved were acquitted because intent to kill could not be established, and because the court could not determine which of the defendants was responsible for the actual killing.

The first known mention of Spock was in a discussion between Gene Roddenberry and Gary Lockwood, where the latter suggested Leonard Nimoy for the role. Roddenberry agreed with the suggestion, and Nimoy became the first choice actor for the part. However, Roddenberry was required to audition other actors for the role. It was offered to both DeForest Kelley and Martin Landau before Nimoy. Nimoy disliked the prosthetic ears he was required to wear, and there were concerns from the studio that they made him appear satanic. Roddenberry fought to keep the character in the second pilot, \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\" after the rest of the main cast was dropped from the initial pilot, \\"The Cage\\". Nimoy revealed he wasn't Gene Roddenberry's first choice to play Spock during an interview segment of TV Land's 40th Anniversary Star Trek Marathon. Nimoy stated that Gene Roddenberry's first choice to play Spock was George Lindsey. Because of the flippant way Nimoy makes the comment it has been suggested that he was joking. The claim Lindsey was offered the role is given more credibility when Lindsey's close friend Ernest Borgnine wrote in his autobiography, \\"my hand to God - he turned down the part of Mr. Spock on TV's Star Trek, the role that made Leonard Nimoy famous.\\" Soon after the series began broadcasting, \\"Spockmania\\" began. Both NBC and individual studios demanded a more prominent role for the character due to the fan response. Prior to the second season, Nimoy renegotiated his salary. During this time, both Mark Lenard and Lawrence Montaigne were seriously considered as replacement Vulcans. Nimoy was retained, and continued to develop the character through the season, creating the iconic Vulcan salute. Following the cancellation of the series, various projects were undertaken during the 1970s to re-launch Star Trek. Nimoy had dropped out of working on them after his likeness was used in a Heineken advertisement without his permission. The character of Xon, played by David Gautreaux, was created as a replacement for him in the series Star Trek: Phase II;, however when the production became Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Nimoy was persuaded to return. Nimoy agreed to return for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan with the promise of a death scene for the character. The fan response was overwhelmingly negative to the news, but after Nimoy enjoyed the production, he asked if there was a means in which the death could be ambiguous. Nimoy returned for the next film, and convinced studio chief Michael Eisner that he should direct it. The film was successful, and he was asked to direct the following film, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home as well. Due to delays in negotiating William Shatner's contract, a consideration was made to re-booting the franchise and starting again with new, younger actors. This was abandoned; Star Trek V: The Final Frontier introduced a previously unmentioned half brother of Spock, Sybok. Following the poor reception of the film, the re-boot was once again considered, but instead Nimoy was asked to organise the sixth film, Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. To promote the film, he agreed to appear in The Next Generation. He refused to return for Star Trek Generations as the expected role was not significant enough, and the character did not return to the franchise again until 2009's Star Trek, where it was recast and portrayed by Zachary Quinto. Nimoy also agreed to return, playing the older version of the character. Quinto sought his advice about how to play the character, and the two became friends. Nimoy appeared one final time in a cameo within the 2013 film Star Trek Into Darkness; he died prior to production on the 2016's Star Trek Beyond. Within that film, a scene was included to reference the in- universe death of the older version of the character. The Original Series =Origins and \\"The Cage\\"= The earliest mention of Spock known was from a conversation Gene Roddenberry had with Gary Lockwood at Roddenberry's home. Lockwood had been the lead actor on Roddenberry's The Lieutenant which had just been cancelled after one season. Roddenberry explained in that conversation that he had created an alien with the name of Spock, and he wanted the character to be very intelligent and possibly green. He asked Lockwood for his advice about who could play the character, and Roddenberry was reminded about Leonard Nimoy, who had made a guest appearance in The Lieutenant episode \\"In the Highest Tradition\\". Several days afterwards, Roddenberry's secretary Dorothy Fontana read his new Star Trek proposal, asking Roddenberry immediately if he had someone in mind to play Spock. She was handed a glossy photograph of Nimoy in response. It was not until much later that Roddenberry became aware that the character had a namesake, in Dr. Benjamin Spock. Despite having Nimoy immediately in mind for the part, Roddenberry was required to audition other actors for the part. Actors who read for the part included Victor Lundin, and both Rex Holman and Michael Dunn were considered. The network, NBC, were pushing for a known actor to play the role, as was Robert Butler, who was to direct the Star Trek pilot, \\"The Cage\\". Butler opposed the casting of DeForest Kelley as the doctor character, but both he and the NBC executives thought he would be good as Spock. Roddenberry met with Kelley and offered him the job, but he did not want to play the alien character. Seeking to get a different star, Roddenberry offered the role to Martin Landau, but he did not want to play the same character on a weekly basis and found the character's lack of emotions limiting. During an interview segment of TV Land's 40th Anniversary Star Trek Marathon on November 12, 2006 Leonard Nimoy reveals that Gene Roddenberry's first choice to play Spock was George Lindsey. Because of the flippant way Nimoy makes the comment it has been suggested that he was joking. The claim Lindsey was offered the role is given more credibility when Lindsey's close friend Ernest Borgnine wrote in his autobiography, \\"my hand to God - he turned down the part of Mr. Spock on TV's Star Trek, the role that made Leonard Nimoy famous.\\" Leonard Nimoy, in costume as Spock from the Star Trek pilots When offered, Nimoy accepted the role. However, he was still apprehensive as he wanted to have a serious acting career and did not want to be made to look foolish by playing an alien with pointy ears and other as-then undetermined makeup. When the character was included in the original 1964 pitch, Roddenberry wrote that the character was \\"probably half Martian, he has a slightly reddish complexion and semi-pointed ears\\". Early versions had the character ingest energy through a plate in his stomach. Writer Samuel A. Peeples told Roddenberry these attributes made Spock too alien, and suggested \\"he should at least be half-human and have the problems of both sides\\", believing the human traits made the character more interesting and able to comment on the human condition more believably. Spock's home planet was changed because Roddenberry thought if the show was a success, humans might actually walk on Mars during the series' run. The eventual logical nature of Spock was originally written into the character Number One as portrayed by Majel Barrett. It was not until the second pilot that this was included as one of Spock's traits. The first makeup tests for Spock were conducted as production began on the pilot. Lee Greenway, a makeup artist for Desilu Studios, applied papier-m√¢ch√© and liquid latex directly to Nimoy's ears. A variety of tests were conducted over the course of four or five days. The actor was horrified at the results, saying the creations made him look like an \\"overgrown jackrabbit\\" or an \\"elf with a hyperactive thyroid\\". Fred Phillips was subsequently asked to make the ears, but he passed this task onto John Chambers so he could concentrate on achieving the right shade of red for Spock's skin. The red hue was abandoned, as when viewed on television sets it made Nimoy look dark skinned. The makeup artists tried a yellow hue instead, which lightened Nimoy on television and it was agreed that this was an improvement. Meanwhile, Chambers re-created an ear mould as the ones created earlier for Nimoy were damaged. These new moulds would be the basis of the well known Spock ears. Each time Nimoy wore the ears, they were glued into place and could only be removed with solvent. But the ears were damaged in their removal, and so each pair could only be worn once. Elf jokes from the crew were irritating Nimoy, and he complained to Roddenberry that the character could ruin his career and he no longer wanted to play Spock. Roddenberry talked him around, and Nimoy said to a journalist at the time that \\"Playing some monster or freak can be the kiss of death for an actor, and this emotionless guy with pointy ears from another planet just didn't appeal to me\\", but he and Roddenberry had \\"talked it over and agreed I wouldn't just be a walking computer who gives scientific data.\\" Furthermore, Roddenberry pledged to Nimoy that if the actor remained unhappy with the ears by the 13th episode then he would find a means of removing them from the show. Fellow cast member Laurel Goodwin assured Nimoy that the character, including the ears, would make him a sex symbol. She also suggested the styling of Nimoy's sideburns into points. Nimoy was not the only person concerned with Spock's ears. NBC executives were worried that it made him appear satanic, and were concerned that viewers would not wish to associate with an alien character. At the time, Roddenberry felt that the satanic issue might prove positive as he believed that female viewers would find a slightly dangerous and taboo character more attractive. This was supported by female visitors to the set who seemed to be immediately drawn to Nimoy. =\\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\" and the first season= Following the failure of \\"The Cage\\" to launch Star Trek into series, and the unexpected ordering of a second pilot, NBC wanted the majority of the main cast dropped. They specifically specified that Spock should not appear in the new pilot. But Roddenberry was determined to keep the character, announcing to NBC that he would not do a new pilot without Spock. He said that the character acted as a constant and much needed reminder to the viewer that the series was set in space. NBC backed down, but insisted that he only be used as a background character in the new pilot, \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\". During the course of the production, the logical manner previously seen in Number One in \\"The Cage\\" was written into the Spock character. Star Trek went to series on the basis of the second pilot, but still fearing blacklash against Spock's ears, and issues with selling the show to stations in the Bible Belt, NBC airbrushed out the pointed tips in an advertising brochure about the series. Spock's role was used as audition material for new cast members. Nichelle Nichols was intrigued by the role when she read his lines, and asked why the character could not be female. The producers response was that Nimoy would not like it. It was during the filming of the first non-pilot episode to be shot, \\"The Corbomite Maneuver\\", that under the direction of Joseph Sargent, Nimoy was directed to remain aloof during a tense moment and said the catchphrase \\"fascinating\\" for the first time. This moment was subsequently given by the writing staff as an example of how the character should act. Nimoy liked Spock's newly logical nature, observing that the character is \\"struggling to maintain a Vulcan attitude, a Vulcan philosophical posture and a Vulcan logic, opposing what was fighting him internally, which was human emotion\\". Nimoy stated that after \\"The Naked Time\\", in which a disease causes Spock to cry, \\"I knew that we were not playing a man with no emotions, but a man who had great pride, who had learned to control his emotions and who would deny that he knew what emotions were. In a way, he was more human than anyone else on the ship.\\" Spock's popularity incensed William Shatner, who felt that Captain Kirk should have been the most popular. The tendency to keep Spock as a background character continued for the first eight episodes of The Original Series, when the NBC executives called Roddenberry and producer Herbert Franklin Solow to their offices in Burbank. The executives complained that Spock was not appearing frequently in the show. They had received requests from local stations asking for Spock- centric episodes, which they referred to as \\"Spockmania\\". When told they were told that it was NBC who requested he be a background character, they flatly denied it and said it was obvious how popular Spock had become. Roddenberry showed them the advertising brochure as evidence and only then did they apologise. It was decided to switch the romantic lead in \\"This Side of Paradise\\" from Hikaru Sulu to Spock, something that made Nimoy apprehensive. But he subsequently said he enjoyed being able to act out Spock's emotions, and praised writer D. C. Fontana for expanding Vulcan culture within the series. The sudden increase in popularity of Spock caused William Shatner, who portrayed Captain James T. Kirk, to be dismayed that he was not portraying the favourite character. Although he was being paid $5,000 an episode, plus a percentage of profits, and Nimoy was being paid $1,250 an episode, it was the latter who was receiving several sacks of fan mail a week. The fan mail figures were leaked to the press, angering Shatner. This animosity from Shatner increased when reporters from Time arrived at the studio and set up for a photoshoot around Nimoy's makeup chair. Shatner and James Doohan were also in the makeup room, and Doohan later recalled that once Shatner realised he was being ignored, he jumped from his chair, shouted that he was the Captain of the show and from then on he would have his makeup applied in his trailer. The popularity of Spock had built to the extent that gossip columnists in Hollywood spread rumours among agents that Shatner was going to be dropped from the series and replaced with Nimoy as the lead. Following the end of the first season, producer Robert H. Justman decided to prank Nimoy. He had partially convinced Nimoy that it would have been preferable to have permanent plastic surgery to point the tips of his ears instead of requiring the hour and a half of makeup each day to apply them. It was only when Nimoy began to agree with Justman's suggestion that the producer let on that it was a joke, which Nimoy found amusing. Nimoy became unhappy with his pay during the course of the season, since Shatner was being paid more than he was. But he was asked by the producers to table the discussion until confirmation was received that the series was renewed. =Contract renegotiation and the second season= Following the confirmation of the second season, Nimoy's agent sought to increase the salary on Nimoy's signed contract in response to the growing popularity of his character. Although negotiations started at $3,000 per episode, the agent made it known that Nimoy would settle for $2,500, half of what Shatner was being paid but twice as much as before. While this was being considered by the producers, Nimoy's agent misheard a conversation between Solow and a colleague regarding Mission: Impossible salaries and was led to believe that Martin Landau and his wife Barbara Bain were receiving a combined salary of $11,000 per episode. Enraged, he demanded that Nimoy received $9,000 an episode. Roddenberry suggested suspending Nimoy and initiating legal action in response, and replacing Spock with a new Vulcan character. The production team began compiling a list of actors who could be brought in to portray a replacement for Spock. At the head of this list was Mark Lenard, who had already appeared as the Romulan Commander in the episode \\"Balance of Terror\\". While greatly admired by the crew, he was ruled out as they felt that he lacked the required depth and sensitivity. The second choice was Lawrence Montaigne, and when he appeared in \\"Amok Time\\" as Stonn, an option to retain him for the rest of the series was written into his contract. Although only Lenard and Montaigne were seriously considered, several other actors were initially listed including David Carradine, William Smithers, Liam Sullivan and Stewart Moss. Nimoy demonstrating the Vulcan salute in 2011 With the Star Trek producers threatening to sue his client if he did not attend the production of episodes, Nimoy's agent went directly to the executives at NBC. Horrified that they would lose Spock and the marketing potential for the character, they demanded that Solow and Roddenberry negotiate. Eventually, it was agreed that Nimoy's salary would increase to $2,500, plus $100 for expenses, improvements to billing and greater input on scripts. Roddenberry became concerned at the concentration of the fanbase on Spock and not Kirk. He wrote to his friend, noted science fiction writer Isaac Asimov for advice on what to do about the situation. They corresponded several times on the subject, and Asimov suggested several ideas to enhance Kirk's popularity. These included placing the character in disguises to make Kirk seem more fun, or to create situations where Spock must save Kirk's life to demonstrate who the more important character was. Nimoy continued to develop Spock alongside individual directors. When work was underway on \\"Amok Time\\", he discussed with Joseph Pevney how Vulcans would greet each other. Nimoy suggested the use of a hand signal from the Priestly Blessing as performed by Jewish Kohen. He had seen this as a child, although Nimoy's father had told him not to look as they performed the blessing. This became the basis for the Vulcan salute. Solow later said that Nimoy was the key contributor to the character's depiction, saying that the \\"Mr Spock character was 20% created by Gene Roddenberry, 20% created by me and 60% created by Leonard Nimoy\\". Nimoy recalled, \\"As a Jew from Catholic Boston, I understood what it was like to feel alienated, apart from the mainstream... there were a number of values in Star Trek that I felt very comfortable with as a Jew\\". The character influenced Nimoy as well; years after the show he wrote that \\"To this day, I sense Vulcan speech patterns, Vulcan social attitudes and even Vulcan patterns of logic and emotional suppression in my behavior.\\" During the course of the second season, Nimoy recorded the album Leonard Nimoy Presents Mr. Spock's Music from Outer Space. Based on his creation of the character, Roddenberry demanded half the royalties, causing a rift with Nimoy. Their working relationship was exacerbated by the number of times Nimoy asked for changes to the scripts under his new contract, as he was unhappy when Spock was only featured in the background while saying catchphrases. By the end of the second season, Roddenberry and Nimoy's relationship had diminished to the point that they were only speaking through formal letters to each other. The relationship never recovered, and remained frosty for the rest of Roddenberry's life. =Season three and \\"Spock's Brain\\"= Kirk controls Spock via remote control in \\"Spock's Brain\\" In a production memo before the third season, Roddenberry credited Nimoy and the show's writers for developing Spock into a \\"fully dimensional\\" character. Roddenberry said Spock is difficult to write properly, and encouraged the writers to revisit some of the character's more colorful aspects, such as his music-playing and ongoing chess game with Kirk. He also said fans' most frequent request was for more confrontation between McCoy and Spock. With a move to an unfavourable timeslot for the third season, Roddenberry decided to step back as show runner. NBC brought in Fred Freiberger, who did not have any history with the series. At a meeting with Roddenberry, Shatner and Nimoy, Freiberger openly asked Roddenberry whether it was Kirk or Spock who was meant to be the main character. With both actors looking on in anticipation of an answer, Roddenberry refused to give a response at first. He then stormed out the room, yelling \\"It's Bill. Bill is the star of the series.\\" as he left. Producer Gene L. Coon also left the series prior to the third season, and Nimoy subsequently found it more difficult to ensure that Spock was written in a manner that he preferred. This was because Roddenberry and Coon had been guiding the writers on how to write the characters during the first two seasons, and re-writing those scripts where required. With them both gone, the new writers would often write out of character situations for the main cast to perform. One of Nimoy's major complaints of the third season was the episode \\"Spock's Brain\\". His complaints were vocal, as he did not appreciate Spock being made a fool of in the episode. A well-known scene from the third season was the kiss between Kirk and Uhura, played by Nichols, from the episode \\"Plato's Stepchildren\\", one of the first interracial kisses on an American network television. As it was written in the script, this was to have been between Spock and Uhura. But Shatner, using his influence with the writers and producers, demanded that since he was the star of the show and that this would be a historic moment, that it should be re-written so that his character was featured instead of Spock. Phase II and The Motion Picture During the 1970s, following on from the success of re-runs of the series in broadcast syndication, Roddenberry sought to create a Star Trek film. However, during this period Nimoy had been difficult to pin down. While the film was in the guise of Star Trek: The God Thing, Nimoy had agreed to appear. However, after his likeness as Spock was used in Heineken adverts without his permission and without any royalties, he dropped out of the production which by this point had been relaunched as Star Trek: Planet of the Titans. This caused some concern among the other actors, as they were worried that the production would not go ahead without him. These issues were resolved, and one version of the script by director Philip Kaufman would have featured Spock as the main character, facing off against a Klingon nemesis played by Toshiro Mifune. The film idea was abandoned, and instead production moved on to Star Trek: Phase II, a new television series intended for the Paramount Television Service upon its launch in April 1978. It was claimed by Roddenberry that Nimoy said he was unwilling to return to television as Spock. However, Nimoy said that the first offer Roddenberry gave was a contract for the pilot of the new series, and then guaranteed appearances in two out of every 11 episodes thereafter, which Nimoy rejected. At the time, Nimoy had undertaken a legal challenge against Paramount related to the Heineken adverts and Roddenberry had refused to support his case. Work began on a replacement Vulcan, Xon, with David Gautreaux cast. Production gradually changed to the creation of a feature film over the course of five months in 1977. This resulted in Star Trek: The Motion Picture. For the film, Nimoy was persuaded to return by Jeffrey Katzenberg and the film's director Robert Wise. Xon was removed from the story at the request of Gautreaux who did not want to see him as a secondary character. He appeared in the film in a different role. Death in The Wrath of Khan Nimoy had not intended to join the cast of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, but was enticed back with the promise that his character would be given a dramatic death scene. Nimoy reasoned that since The Wrath of Khan would be the final Star Trek film, having Spock \\"go out in a blaze of glory\\" seemed like a good way to resolve the character's fate. In an early draft of the script, Spock died in the first act in a shocking demise that the movie's producer Harve Bennett compared to Janet Leigh's early death in Psycho. By April 1981, a revised script moved the character's death to the final act. The death scene was shot over three days, during which no visitors were allowed on set. Fan reaction to leaked news that Spock would be killed was overwhelmingly negative, and one fan paid for advertisements urging Paramount to abandon the plan. Nimoy said afterwards that \\"I thought everything was managed in excellent taste. I feel proud. When it was first suggested to me that Spock would die, I was hesitant. It seemed exploitative. But now that I've seen how it was accomplished, I think it was a very good idea.\\" Some fans even went so far as to issue death threats against Leonard Nimoy's family. Bennett explained, \\"For some reason fans got the impression that [Nimoy] wanted Spock dead. He'd written a book I Am Not Spock, and that gave people the idea. Anyway, when a fringe group of Trekkies learned that we were going to kill the Spock character, it was like we'd taken a child of theirs onto the Brooklyn Bridge with the intention of throwing it off. And their reaction was, 'Let's get Leonard.'\\" Spock's death was intended to be irrevocable, but Nimoy had such a positive experience during filming that he asked the producers if there was a way for Spock to return in a later film. The scene showing Spock's mind meld with McCoy was filmed without actor DeForest Kelley's prior knowledge of its true meaning. Test audience reaction to Spock's death and the film's ending was poor, so Bennett made it more uplifting by adding a final scene revealing Spock's casket on the Genesis planet. During this scene, Nimoy read the \\"These are the voyages\\" monologue‚Äîwhich, until then, was used only to begin Star Trek stories, thus implying Spock's \\"story\\" might not be over. Director Nicholas Meyer objected but did not obstruct the changes, and even Nimoy did not know about the new scene until he viewed the film. Before the film opened, the media reassured worried fans that Spock would \\"live again\\". The later film franchise Nimoy became \\"excited\\" about the prospect of portraying Spock once more after he had seen The Wrath of Khan. Paramount Pictures approached him to see if he wanted to play Spock once more, but coupled with a desire to achieve a film career outside of the franchise, he told them he wanted to direct the next film. After convincing studio chief Michael Eisner that he had not had the death of Spock included in his contract for the previous film, and he did not hate Star Trek as Eisner believed, Nimoy was given the job. Eisner immediately joked that the title could be \\"Leonard Nimoy directs The Search for Spock\\", and although other story ideas were considered, the general premise remained. One idea which was ruled out, was to have Spock appear in a ghost-like form, similar to Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Following the success of Star Trek III: The Search for Spock', Nimoy was once again asked to direct. Production was delayed for several months while Shatner negotiated for a pay increase. This resulted in Bennett considering replacing the entire main cast, and filming a prequel instead, with the idea that it would cut down on both Shatner and Nimoy's increasing wage costs and be far more profitable. Shatner, Nimoy and Roddenberry were against the re-boot idea, and when eventually Shatner agreed to a new contract the impetus to replace the cast was lost. Nimoy, on the evolution of Spock in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, said \\"He's a very different Spock. A Spock who's evolving, who's confused. He's trying to figure out who he's supposed to be and how he's supposed to function\\". He identified the moment when Spock rediscovered himself as the scene where the character says \\"No, but it is the human thing to do.\\" in response to a question from Kirk about whether or not rescuing Pavel Chekov from the hospital was logical. William Shatner directed Star Trek V: The Final Frontier and the film introduced Spock's previously unmentioned half-brother, Sybok. Nimoy had issues with some parts of the early scripts, as they called for Spock to betray Kirk because Sybok helps him to understand his human side. It was changed at Nimoy's suggestion to the revelation that Spock had already come to terms with the human side of his nature, and Sybok had admiration for that. Production was delayed by several months as Nimoy was away directing The Good Mother. In response, Shatner threatened to shoot the film without Nimoy, but it was accepted to be an empty threat. Following the lackluster reception of The Final Frontier at the box office, Bennett once again proposed a Starfleet Academy style film with an all new main cast to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the franchise. The idea leaked and was argued against on the convention circuit by Roddenberry and the main cast, and Paramount began to receive a huge backlash from the fanbase. Roddenberry said, \\"Who was going to cast the new Kirk and Spock? No one has ever cast a Trek character besides me that's worked.\\" On the basis of the negative fan reaction, and a limited time- frame before the anniversary, Paramount CEO Frank Mancuso Sr. gave the organisational duties for the sixth film to Nimoy, asking him to appoint producers, writers and a director. Nimoy brought Nicholas Meyer back to Star Trek to direct the sixth film. Together Meyer and Denny Martin Flinn wrote new directions for some of the characters, including the attachment of Spock to his protege, Valeris, played by Kim Cattrall. Nimoy also felt that the theme of Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country was successful, saying \\"Spock experienced prejudice growing up half-Vulcan and half-human, in Star Trek VI, Spock becomes an emissary against prejudice and discovers, during the course of the story, his own prejudices.\\" =\\"Unification\\" and Generations= One of the requirements given by Mancuso to Nimoy when asking him to oversee The Undiscovered Country was to have a handover moment between The Original Series and Star Trek: The Next Generation. The initial idea was to have the film introduce an element that would later be picked up by The Next Generation, and was discussed with Nimoy, Meyer and the series producer Rick Berman. It was agreed that Nimoy would make an appearance as Spock in the series, across a two-part episode, in an idea developed by Berman and Michael Piller. The actor was sold on the idea that Spock would be a central figure in an attempt to reunite the Vulcan and Romulan people in a peaceful manner, which Nimoy liked. The two parts of the episode were shot out of order to accommodate Nimoy's availability across five days. Piller later suggested in hindsight that he could have done a great deal more with Spock but the reunification of the Vulcan and Romulan people was of sufficient \\"cosmic significance\\" to warrant the return of the character to television. Nimoy was approached to direct Star Trek Generations, as well as appear, but turned down both roles as he felt that Spock's part in the film was not significant enough. The intention had been to include Shatner as Kirk, Nimoy as Spock and Kelley as Leonard McCoy. After the latter two turned down appearances, the lines were re-written for James Doohan as Montgomery Scott and Walter Koenig as Chekov. The line by Scotty which starts \\"I have a theory\\", had originally been written for Spock. Recasting for the Kelvin timeline Zachary Quinto was cast as Spock for the 2009 Star Trek film When considering actors for the part of Spock, the producers of the film sent Nimoy video footage of each one. He highlighted the work of Zachary Quinto, as he felt that the actor looked sufficiently like himself for it to work, and that it seemed like Quinto could portray the inner thought process of the character. Quinto, who previously had appeared as Sylar in the television series Heroes, had heard about the production on the new film and expressed his interest in a December 2006 interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Quinto expressed interest in the role because of the duality of Spock's half-human, half-Vulcan heritage, and how the character \\"is constantly exploring that notion of how to evolve in a responsible way and how to evolve in a respectful way. I think those are all things that we as a society, and certainly the world, could implement.\\" The Pittsburgh Post- Gazette interview was circulated, and attracted the attention of director J.J. Abrams. Quinto was subsequently the first actor to be cast in the film, while Nimoy was confirmed to return as the older \\"Prime\\" version of Spock from the main timeline. Nimoy said he had returned to the role because of the script and the enthusiasm shown by Abrams alongside Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman explaining what they wanted from the script and the Spock character. He added, \\"I had felt marginalized for a long time. I hadn't been asked to be involved with Star Trek for something like 17 or 18 years. And this felt like somebody said, 'There's a value to you, that we'd like to take advantage of and do something with.' And it felt good. It felt good. It felt like being, frankly, appreciated. I was happy to go back to work.\\" Nimoy subsequently befriended Quinto. Although Quinto watched some episodes of The Original Series during breaks in filming, he said Nimoy was his main resource in playing Spock. Nimoy made his final appearance as Spock as a cameo in the 2013 film, Star Trek Into Darkness. Abrams approached him and asked for a favor, and Nimoy agreed as he felt that the lines could only be said by his version of Spock and was about the character itself. The appearance was kept a secret until the premiere, as it was shot at Bad Robot Productions headquarters in Santa Monica, California, with only Nimoy and Abrams present. Nimoy did not rule out a further appearance as Spock, saying that he would hear what Abrams had to offer since he considered him a friend and he had done \\"a great thing for Star Trek\\". Nimoy died on February 27, 2015, ahead of the production of the third Kelvin timeline film, Star Trek Beyond. Quinto later said at a Beyond fan event, \\"In a way I feel like he‚Äôs more a part of this film than he was the other two. We were all so cognizant of his absence but I think in the face of that, we all held him in our hearts more fully. Everyone on this film showed up to work in the spirit of celebrating his life and his indelible contribution to this franchise... He‚Äôs there in a really powerful way.\\" Director Justin Lin confirmed that there would be an indication that Spock from the main timeline had died in the film.

On 10 November 2014, Lidcombe Power Centre went through a $120m redevelopment that transformed the centre from a bulky goods centre to a sub- regional centre. The centre was to be called The Marketplace Auburn. Leading retailers including Woolworths, Aldi and Kmart were added to the centre. Anaconda and Spotlight moved to the new part of the centre when the redevelopment was completed.

Trager's research focused on developing microbiological culture systems for a variety of eukaryotic pathogens. He is best known for developing a culture system for the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum with James Jensen in the 1970s. Early life and education William Trager was born March 20, 1910 in Newark, New Jersey to Leon and Anna (Emilfork) Trager. He received his bachelor of science degree from Rutgers University in 1930. He then moved to Harvard University where he was the first graduate student of L. R. Cleveland. In Cleveland's lab, Trager established a culture system for flagellate symbionts of the roach Cryptocercus punctulatus, showing that the roach's ability to digest cellulose was actually due to the cellulases of the symbiotic flagellates. This work formed his PhD thesis, titled \\"The cultivation of some intestinal flagellates of termites and the nature of the symbiosis between these protozoa and their insect host\\" which he was granted in 1933. Career Following his Ph.D., Trager joined the lab of Rudolf Glaser in the Department of Animal and Plant Pathology in the Princeton, New Jersey division of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research as a postdoctoral fellow. In Glaser's lab, Trager developed a culture system for growing the virus Borrelina which causes the disease grasseri in silkworms. Also while with Glaser, Trager developed a system to grow Aedes aegypti mosquito larvae in a nutrient medium, identifying the nutrients that the larvae require for development. In 1934, Trager was appointed to the staff of the Rockefeller Institute. During World War II, Trager served as a captain in the US Army Sanitary Corps supervising clinical trials with the antimalarial atabrine. After the war, Trager turned his research focus to malaria, investigating the conditions required to grow Plasmodium parasites in culture. He began with work on the bird malaria parasite Plasmodium lophurae, working both on extending the survival of the parasite in culture, and characterizing the nutrients that made birds susceptible to infection. In 1950, Trager moved along with the rest of the Department of Animal and Plant Pathology to the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research campus in New York City, where he would work until his retirement. Following the move, Trager pursued his interest in how P. lophurae survives inside host red blood cells by undertaking an investigation of infected cells using electron microscopy with Maria Rudzinska. Together, they found that parasites seem to take up pieces of the host cytosol by a type of phagocytosis, and that the pigment hemozoin is formed in specialized digestive vacuoles where hemoglobin is digested. Subsequently, along with Phyllis Bradbury, they described the ultrastructure of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, identifying the \\"knob\\" structures on the surface of infected cells that allow the parasitized cells to stick to blood vessels. Trager and Rudzinska went on to describe the structure of another parasite of red blood cells: Babesia, for which they discovered the sexual stage, and described its organelles and invasion process. In 1964, Trager was promoted to Professor and Head of the Laboratory of Parasitology, a position he would hold for the next 16 years. In the 1970s Trager and a postdoctoral fellow James B. Jensen performed the work for which Trager is best known: the cultivation of P. falciparum. They found that they could take the blood of Aotus monkeys infecte with P. falciparum, dilute the blood into human red blood cells, and with the addition of human serum and RPMI 1640 media, get P. falciparum to grow for weeks. Jensen greatly improved the culture method by introducing a carbon-dioxide rich environment through the use of a simple air-tight candle jar, where a flame is lit and allowed to burn out. Trager also worked sporadically throughout his career on kinetoplastid parasites. He showed that the intracellular stage of Leishmania donovani could be cultured for several days, and established a tsetse fly tissue culture system to grow all the life stages of Trypanosoma vivax. He also developed a ontinuous culture system for the lizard-infecting parasite Leishmania tarentolae. In 1980, Trager transitioned to the role of emeritus professor at Rockefeller University. Personal life Trager married Ida Susnow, whom he has known since high school, in 1936. Together they had three children: Leslie, Carolyn, and Lillian. He died, likely of a heart attack, at his home in Manhattan on Saturday, January 22nd, 2005.  Awards  Trager received many awards over the course of his life. He received honorary degrees from Rutgers University in 1965 and Rockefeller University in 1987. He was awarded the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene's Manson Medal in 1986, and Thailand's Prince Mahidol Award in 1994. Trager was president of the Society of Protozoologists from 1960 to 1961, the American Society of Parasitologists from 1973 to 1974, and the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene from 1978 to 1979.

It comprises the local government areas of Port Harcourt, Oyigbo, Okrika, Ogu‚ÄìBolo, Obio-Akpor, Ikwerre, Etche and Eleme. It covers an area of approximately 1,900 km¬≤ (734 mi¬≤) and as of 2009 had a population of 2 million people. Major plans have been made to build the planned metro area through implementing and enforcing infrastructural development and service delivery policies geared to improving the standard of living and well-being of the people. The key anchors of the new metro area include Port Harcourt International Airport, Port Harcourt City, and Port of Onne. The Greater Port Harcourt City Development Authority (GPHCDA) was created by law on 2 April 2009 as The Greater Port Harcourt City Development Authority Law No. 2 of 2009. Its mandate is to facilitate the implementation of the Greater Port Harcourt master plan and develop the new metropolitan area. History Greater Port Harcourt was originally conceived as a means to cater to the growing population of Port Harcourt metropolis, the increased demand for housing, modern urban amenities, medical and educational facilities, as well as services. The siting of the project, which was earlier referred to as New Port Harcourt before being officially titled Greater Port Harcourt has leaped the existing dimension of sprawl, changing the dynamics of land space. The area incorporates the entire Port Harcourt (local government area) and portions of Oyigbo, Okrika, Ogu‚ÄìBolo, Obio-Akpor, Ikwerre, Etche and Eleme local government areas. Since 1975, there have been intents to develop the Greater Port Harcourt urban centre, although the construction project was not implemented nor was it fully abandoned. In October 2008, the master plan for the development of the metropolitan area was completed. Designed by Arcus GIBB, the plan consisted of two main parts, including renewal of Port Harcourt, and the establishment of a conurbation to help de-densify the original city. The Greater Port Harcourt City Development Authority was created by law on 2 April 2009 as The Greater Port Harcourt City Development Authority Law No. 2 of 2009. Its primary function is to oversee the implementation of the master plan commencing with the first phase which is split into sections A,B,C and D. Phase 1 layout spans from the Port Harcourt International Airport junction across to Professor Tam David-West Road and extends to part of Igwuruta. This layout comprises clusters of neighbourhoods: low, medium and high densities, mixed use complexes, schools, churches, golf course and estates, internal road networks and storm water drains. In 2011, Greater Port Harcourt hosted several of the events at the 17th National Sports Festival. In June 2015, an estimated completion time of 5 years was announced for the first phase of the project. Infrastructure Infrastructures which are scheduled to be built include: * Crime prevention and integrated security system * 24 hours electricity supply * Network of reticulated water supply * Water borne sewage system * Public transportation system * Storm water management and disposal system * Residential neighbourhoods * Commercial * Industrial areas, parks and gardens * 212-hectare Rivers State University of Science and Technology campus * 50-hectare entertainment and sports precinct * Justice Karibi-Whyte 1,000 bed hospital complex References External links * Greater Port Harcourt master plan Geography of Port Harcourt Metropolitan areas of Nigeria Proposed populated places Mixed-use developments in Nigeria Planned cities in Nigeria ","title":"Greater Port Harcourt"},{"id":"51265263","text":"Giovanni Ducco (died 1496) was a Roman Catholic prelate who served as Bishop of Coron (1479‚Äì1496).\\"Bishop Giovanni Ducco\\" Catholic-Hierarchy.org.

Schmidt House or as the Schmidt- Schaf House, is a historic home and carriage house located at 1410 North Delaware Street in Indianapolis, Marion County, Indiana. The Propylaeum was named after the Greek word \\"prop√Ωlaion,\\" meaning \\"gateway to higher culture.\\" The property became the headquarters for the Indianapolis Woman's Club in 1923, as well as the host for several other social and cultural organizations. It was initially built in 1890-1891 as a private residence for John William Schmidt, president of the Indianapolis Brewing Company, and his family. Joseph C. Schaf, president of the American Brewing Company of Indianapolis, and his family were subsequent owners of the home. The Indianapolis Propylaeum association, formed in 1888 as a joint stock company of women, continues to manage the site as a gathering place and rental facility for cultural activities and private events. The three-story, Neo-Jacobean-style building is constructed of red brick with limestone trim. It sits on a full basement and has hipped roof of slate with several gables. The main features of its exterior include a wraparound verandah, square tower, and porte-coch√®re. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as \\"The Propylaeum (John W. Schmidt House)\\" in 1973. The Indiana Historical Bureau erected a state historical marker at the site in 1999. History =Propylaeum association= In 1888 May Wright Sewall, an Indianapolis educator, clubwoman, community leader and women's rights advocate, urged members of the Indianapolis Woman's Club (established in 1875) to form a stock company to finance construction of a headquarters building for the club. The women also planned to make earn money for their group by renting the building to the city's other cultural and social organizations. Sewall later acknowledged that the idea was inspired by building projects that women in other cities had funded, such as the Athenaeum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; the Ladies' Library Association building in Kalamazoo, Michigan; and the Woman's Club of Grand Rapids, Michigan. The Indianapolis Propylaeum association, named after the Greek word \\"prop√Ωlaion,\\" meaning \\"gateway to higher culture,\\" incorporated in June 1888, with Sewall elected as its president. Later that month the association issued its initial public offering of $15,000, sold at $25 per share. Stock ownership was restricted to women.Boomhower, pp. 59‚Äì61. In May 1889 the Propylaeum's stockholders agreed to increase its capital stock to $20,000. All of the stock was sold by March 10, 1890.Boomhower, p. 61. The group laid the cornerstone for the original Propylaeum building at 17 East North Street, between Meridian and Pennsylvania Streets, on May 8, 1890; it was dedicated on January 27, 1891.Boomhower, pp. 61‚Äì63. The Indianapolis Propylaeum was among the first of its kind in the United States to be \\"financed entirely by women stockholders.\\" From its inception the association intended to offer \\"educational opportunities\\" to men and women and establish its clubhouse as a cultural center for the city. The building served as the headquarters for the Indianapolis Woman's Club, as well as host to several other social and cultural organizations, including music, dramatic, and literary clubs, the Portfolio Club (a group for artists and writers), the Art Association of Indianapolis, and the Contemporary Club, among others.Boomhower, pp. 60 and 63.\\"Historical Sketch\\" in In 1892 the Propylaeum association established the Indianapolis Local Council of Women, which changed its name to the Indianapolis Council of Women in 1923. The council advocated woman's suffrage and Progressive-era reforms, such as better streets and sanitary conditions, new laws protecting working conditions for women and girls, and improvements in education and public health. The council's first meeting was held at the Propylaeum building on North Street on May 3, 1892. In 1923 the Indianapolis city government purchased the Propylaeum's North Street property as part of the site for the Indiana World War Memorial Plaza and had the original Propylaeum building demolished. Instead of constructing a new clubhouse, the association purchased property at Fourteenth and Delaware Streets that included an existing residence, carriage house, and stable. The Propylaeum organization has managed the North Delaware Street site since 1923. It continues to support local cultural activities and sponsors public events. The association also rents its clubhouse for private events. =Propylaeum building= The Propylaeum building, also known as the Schmidt-Schaf House, is located at 1410 North Delaware Street in Indianapolis, Marion County, Indiana. It was built in 1890‚Äì91 as a private residence for its original owner, John William Schmidt, his wife, Lily, and their four children. John Schmidt was president of the Indianapolis Brewing Company and later the Polar Ice Company. The Schmidt family lived in the home for twelve years. Muncie, Indiana, industrialist George F. McCulloch, owner of the Indianapolis Star, sold it to Joseph C. Schaf in 1905.Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 98. Schaf, who was president of the American Brewing Company of Indianapolis, remodeled the home and lived in it with his wife, Josephine, and their two children. Their daughter, Alice, was married in the home. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs The College of Music and Fine Arts acquired the property from Schaf in 1921, but was unable to make payments on it. The college sold the Schmidt-Schaf home to the Propylaeum association, the property's current owner, in 1923. The Propylaeum's tea room opened in September 1924 and remains in operation. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. In 1988 the Propylaeum was used as a set for a few scenes in the moving picture, Eight Men Out (1988), although the home's interiors were significantly altered during filming. The Indiana Historical Bureau erected a state historical marker at the site in 1999. Building description Former director of the Indianapolis Museum of Art and art historian Wilbur Peat described the building's architecture as a Neo-Jacobean style, which is characterized by an irregular-shaped floor plan, projecting wall sections and bays, a hipped roof, expansive veranda, multiple gables, and prominent chimneys. The architecture of medieval England, especially Tudor- and Jacobean-style homes in England and elsewhere in Europe have influenced this style.Peat, pp. 149‚Äì50. The Propylaeum also has elements of Romanesque Revival, Georgian, and Queen Anne architecture styles. The three-story, red- brick building with limestone trim sits on a full basement and has a hipped roof of slate and decorative terracotta panels on its gables. Main features of its exterior include a wraparound verandah with limestone columns, a square tower on its north facade, and a porte-coch√®re on its south side. The interior has large reception rooms on the first floor, a grand staircase, and Rookwood Pottery tiles on its fireplaces. The second floor contains bedrooms and bathrooms; the third floor includes former servants' quarters and a ballroom. The property also has a separate carriage house.Helmer, ‚ÄúNational Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: The Propylaeum (John W. Schmidt House),‚Äù pp. 2‚Äì3.

It was designed by architect Germain Boffrand. Its construction was completed in 1714. By 1803, the structure was purchased by Eug√®ne de Beauharnais, who had it rebuilt in an Empire style. It has been listed as an official historical monument since July 25, 1951. Today it serves as the official residence of the German Ambassador to France. Location The premises are situated on the left bank of the Seine river, between the Palais Bourbon, the seat of the French National Assembly, in the west and the Mus√©e d'Orsay in the east. The cour d'honneur is located on rue de Lille in the south, to the north, an English garden offers scenic views to the Seine and beyond up to the Tuileries Garden. The vast property is not accessible to the public. History The building was erected at the behest of Foreign Minister Colbert de Torcy (1665‚Äì1746), shortly before his dismissal by Regent Philippe of Orl√©ans. Then named H√¥tel de Torcy, it served as Colbert's retirement home where he kept his extensive art collection and completed his memoirs. View over the Seine and the Tuileries (1801) After several changes of ownership and being plundered during the French Revolution, it passed to Eug√®ne de Beauharnais, a stepson of Napoleon who became Viceroy of Italy and also aimed at the succession to the French throne. The building then received its present-day portico in an Egyptomanian style which was popular in the wake of the French campaign in Egypt. Opulently furnished with large-scale paintings by Hubert Robert, the spacious rooms fitted with Beauharnais' great demands. However, the Viceroy had little opportunity to reside at his Paris home. When Napoleon married the Habsburg archduchess Marie Louise in 1810, he used the H√¥tel as a guest house for Beauharnais' father-in-law, King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria. After the French defeat in the Napoleonic Wars and the Congress of Vienna, the premises were first rented and finally purchased by Prussia under King Frederick William III in 1818 and became the seat of the Prussian legation. In 1862 Otto von Bismarck resided here, before his appointment as Minister president by King William I in September. Following the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì71, it served as the embassy of the German Empire to the French Republic. Prince Chlodwig of Hohenlohe-Schillingsf√ºrst, ambassador from 1873, hosted extravagant ceremonies to improve Franco‚ÄìGerman relations. The impressive architecture and premises inspired Karl Friedrich Schinkel and Leo von Klenze, as well as the painter Max Beckmann. In 1894 the theft of a letter addressed to the German military attach√© Max von Schwartzkoppen at the embassy triggered the Dreyfus affair. The shooting of the German diplomat Ernst vom Rath by 17-year-old Herschel Grynszpan in 1938 provided the Nazi authorities with the pretext for the antisemitic Kristallnacht pogrom. President Charles de Gaulle and President Heinrich L√ºbke at a 1968 reception During World War II, the building served as the Paris residence of Otto Abetz, German ambassador to Vichy France, until it was confiscated in 1944. Held by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it was restored to West Germany in 1961 during the negotiations on the √âlys√©e Treaty. As a new embassy then already was under construction on Avenue Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the building solely served for representative purposes. Extensively renovated and re-opened as the ambassador's residence in 1968, the building's history has been documented by the German Forum for Art History Paris.

Deepak narrates the story to a man who is the son of another police officer who has come for taking career advice from him. Then Deepak starts the story. Three young men (named Fabian, Mano and Melvin) hit a man with the car they were driving on a rainy day in a neighborhood. Afraid that they might get caught, they carry the body to their home. Deepak continues the story from his perspective. He comes to his office in the morning and his sub-ordinate officer informs him about a suicide of a person named Krish that has happened in the area and hands over the license of that person. The informer, who is a newspaper boy is called in to give his information. On his way out, the newspaper boy sees the car from the crime scene and shouts out to police. They ignore him. Deepak visits the crime scene and meets the new police officer, Gautham. Gautham follows his instinct and mentions about the those young men. They go to investigate them. They act suspicious. After finding nothing, they return to the office. While on their way, they get a call informing them of another incident. They go there to find that, Shruti is missing with blood stains on her bedroom. Her friend Vaishnavi was the one to identify this. Later Deepak gets a call saying that Shruti, previous day evening had written a complained against a person Mano. He recognizes the name as that of one of the young men and interrogates them. They tell of the incident that happened 10 days prior to missing of Shruti. The incident was - she unknowingly overspeeds and nearly hits them. The three young men also confess that after the incident, they have not met her. On further investigation in Shruti's apartment, it is revealed that the blood group is B+ which matches with Krish. Gautham investigates and identifies that, Shruti had told the neighbour about a young man who is her fianc√©. They decide that the fianc√© might be Krish and decide to watch the young men as suspects. As the day ends, Deepak decides to go home. His neighbor informs him about a young man who was waiting for him. Deepak had captured a camera from some kids. These kids were asked to meet him at his residence for getting back the camera. From the camera, Deepak sees that Vaishnavi has lied about arriving late to the house, while she was there earlier. He also notices the car number from the video. Both Gautham and Deepak decides to check on Vaishnavi, but they realize that she is missing from her house. They go looking for her everywhere but she is not found. She is then shown to be in the airport. Gautham and Deepak come to the conclusion that one among the young boys might have been the suspect and that Shruti would have given complaint against the one whose name she would have confused with. After this conclusion they see Mano (one among the three young boys) on the road on his way to police station. To the Deepak and Gautham, he narrates the incident of how they hit the man while driving the car, and later carrying the body and finally realizing that the body was taken by the original killer. He confesses this to the police and says that the newspaper boy who saw them hit the man has been asking for ransom and threatening them. The newspaper boy explains to the police that on the day of the incidence, he saw a man with a bullet wound who had apparently committed suicide and another case were the car hit a man. Gautham and Deepak hypothesize the situation by narrating a story - Both Krish and Shruti are in the apartment and then the anonymous killer breaks in and kidnaps Shruti, Krish, and Vaishnavi's assumed boyfriend and threatens Vaishnavi. While trying to escape, Krish is killed. Vaishnavi's boyfriend (assumed) also escapes and is hit by the car and killed. But they are not sure of the story. Finally they get a lead to the car number and follows it. But Gautham and Deepak meets with an accident. After narrating this much, Deepak asks the other man to him he was narrating the story whether he still wants to be in the police. Deepak excuses himself into the house. While he is there, he comes to know that the person with whom he was conversing is not the person whom he thought to be. He becomes cautious and takes his pistol. In the climax it is revealed by Vaishnavi to Deepak that Shruti was abused and her videos taken by Krish (who actually introduced himself to Vaishali as Mano, against whom Shruti had given a complaint) and his friend. Shruti's boyfriend, Rajeev, had planned to visit her this same day to surprise her. He enters the scene. But Krish overpowers him and takes away Shruti. Finally, Rajeev meets Krish and attacks him. In this fight, Krish dies. And Rajeev chases Krish's friend, Prem, and it is this man who gets hit by the car (driven by the men) and dies. Rajeev then takes Vaishanvi and Shruti to Nasik along with him. The man to whom Deepak was talking to reveals himself as his old partner, Gautham. Before Deepak can take his gun, Gautham holds him at gunpoint. He tells Deepak that after the accident he had to get a surgery to get his face restored. He had come to ask Deepak on why he let the killer live. He answers that Rajeev was his son and hence did not solve the case. This angers Gautham who shoots him saying that because of Rajeev, he now has to live as another person. Deepak gets killed, while Gautham gets shot in the arm by the police who later overpowers him. His fate is unknown. The movie ends with Deepak narrating that had the story been told from Gautham's point of view, he would have been the villain. He also said that one small incident, Shruti complaining about Mano (who was actually Krish), had not happened, Krish might not had gone to Shruti's house to abuse her and make her MMS. Had Krish not gone to Shruti's house, Rajeev had not attacked Krish and killed him and Prem (Krish's friend) had not been killed in the car (driven by those 3 men) accident. So, ultimately this whole \\"incident\\" might not have happened. Hence, Gautham might not have gone for the surgery and he (Rahman) might have lived more...

Production In September 2015, Rahman revealed that he would work on a Tamil thriller film to be directed by Karthick Naren, then only aged twenty one years old. Rahman stated that was initially apprehensive about signing on to feature in a film to be made by newcomers and held a few hearings despite being impressed with the way the script was presented to him through a narration that was both \\"appealing and convincing\\". Debutant director Karthick revealed that Rahman was his \\"only choice\\" for the lead role, while stating the script was \\"the culmination of an intensive probe into the world of crime\\" and that his father would back the film as the producer. Sujith Sarang, Sreejith Sarang and Jakes Bejoy, who had previously worked together in Thakka Thakka (2015), collaborated again to work as the cinematographer, editor and music composer for the project. Sachin Sudhakaran and Hariharan worked on the sound engineering for the film, with Rajakrishnan assisting as the mixing engineer. Apart from Rahman, the only other notable actor cast in the film was Delhi Ganesh, with most of the remaining actors being newcomers. Ashwin Kumar, who previously appeared in a supporting role in Jacobinte Swargarajyam (2016), was also picked to play a role, with his identity kept secret during the promotions. Rookie actress Yaashika Aanand appeared in the role of Shruti, her second film appearance following a brief role in Kavalai Vendam (2016). Anjana Jayaprakash, who portrayed the role of Vaishnavi, was a college senior of the director and was signed after the pair had a mutual interest for working on short films. The film was predominantly shot in October and November 2015, over a period of 28 days in and around Chennai, Coimbatore and Ooty. The film's first look was released by director Gautham Menon through a poster in January 2016, while R. Madhavan and A. R. Rahman released a further poster and the trailer of the film, respectively, during August 2016. Prior to the theatrical release of the film, Rahman screened the film for his friends in the film industry.

However, by the first show, the film started receiving a good response, and positive word-of-mouth meant that 160 screens played the film in its second week. Furthermore, the film was moved from smaller halls in cinemas to the biggest main screens in several multiplexes across Chennai. It subsequently went on to become a commercial success at the box office, with Sify.com stating it was a \\"multiplex super hit\\". Following the release of the film, it received widespread critical acclaim with several Indian actors and technicians praising the venture. Rahman praised the team and stated he was \\"left in awe at the efforts of the youthful brigade, and things fell in place as if it was programmed that way\\" and noted that \\"the success should inspire other directors to think out of the box\\". Leading Tamil film technicians including A. R. Rahman, Shankar, AR Murugadoss and Karthik Subbaraj tweeted appreciating the film, as did actors such as Vijay, Silambarasan, Sivakarthikeyan, Rana Daggubati and Prashanth. In his review for The Hindu, film critic Baradwaj Rangan gave the film a positive review and concluded that Dhruvangal Pathinaaru was \\"a procedural with solid writing, first-rate filmmaking\\", adding that the director had \\"announced that he‚Äôs a filmmaker\\". Similarly, The New Indian Express gave the film a very positive review stating \\"an eminently watchable suspense- thriller, Dhruvangal Pathinaaru has a universal sensibility and a feel that makes Tamil cinema proud\\", while also singling out Rahman stating he gave a \\"truly brilliant performance and the best in his career\\". Sify.com wrote it was a \\"well executed whodunit murder mystery\\" and added that the film \\"engages us throughout and keep throwing surprises till the end\\". Likewise, Behindwoods.com noted that it was \\"an engaging thriller with an impressive storyline\\" and that \\"Karthick is a director to look out for\\". Indiaglitz.com stated it was a \\"fantastic thriller\\", concluding \\"D16 is surely the surprise end package to the year 2016, a good finish from a logically sound and promising director supported by a good cast and fine technicalities\\".

Outside the Fusilier Museum in Bury, Greater Manchester, in North West England, it was unveiled in 1922‚Äîon the seventh anniversary of the landing at Cape Helles, part of the Gallipoli Campaign in which the regiment suffered particularly heavy casualties. The memorial was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens. Lutyens was commissioned in light of a family connection‚Äîhis father and great uncle were officers in the Lancashire Fusiliers, a fact noted on a plaque nearby. He designed a tall, slender obelisk in Portland stone. The regiment's cap badge is carved near the top on the front and rear, surrounded by a laurel wreath. Further down are inscriptions containing the regiment's motto and a dedication. Two painted stone flags hang from the sides. The memorial was unveiled by Lieutenant General Sir Henry de Beauvoir De Lisle on 25 April 1922, using the novel method of pressing an electric button. The remaining funds were spent on drums and bugles for the regiment and donated to the Lancashire Fusiliers' compassionate fund. After the Lancashire Fusiliers were amalgamated into the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers in 1968, the memorial was adopted by the new regiment and rededicated to all fusiliers killed in action. It originally sat outside the Lancashire Fusiliers' headquarters in Wellington Barracks but was relocated when the barracks closed in the 1970s. It was moved again in 2009, this time to sit in a public park renamed Gallipoli Gardens, outside the Fusilier Museum, which moved at the same time. The memorial was designated a grade II listed building in 1992. It was upgraded to grade II* in 2015 (on the centenary of the Cape Helles landing), along with two other memorials related to the Gallipoli Campaign; later that year it was recognised as part of a national collection of Lutyens' war memorials. Background In the aftermath of the First World War and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, described by Historic England as \\"the leading English architect of his generation\\". Lutyens established his reputation designing country houses for wealthy clients. After the war, which had a profound effect on him, he devoted much of his time to memorialising its casualties. He became a public figure through his design for The Cenotaph on Whitehall in London, which became Britain's national memorial. This, along with his work for the Imperial War Graves Commission, led to commissions for war memorials across Britain and the empire. As well as memorials for towns and cities, Lutyens was commissioned to design memorials for several private companies and regimental associations, including the Lancashire Fusiliers. These tended to be the least controversial of Lutyens' war memorials‚Äîa site was readily available (in this case the regiment's home barracks) and fundraising was straightforward.Pevsner, p. 86. Lutyens' father was Captain Charles Henry Augustus Lutyens (1829‚Äì1915), formerly an officer in the Lancashire Fusiliers. Captain Lutyens, himself the son of an army officer, spent most of his military career in Canada; he served during the time of the Crimean War but spent it as a musketry instructor in Hythe, Alberta. The architect's great uncle, Major Engelbert Lutyens, also served in the regiment, which is noted on a plaque by the memorial. Engelbert was an orderly officer to Napoleon Bonaparte while the Lancashire Fusiliers guarded the latter during his exile in St Helena at the beginning of the 19th century. In light of his family connections with the regiment, Lutyens waived his fee for the memorial.Skelton, p. 89.Hussey, p. 3.Moorhouse, pp. 180‚Äì181. alt=Black and white photograph of a group of soldiers on a boat The Lancashire Fusiliers (previously the 20th Regiment of Foot) was swollen by thousands of volunteers during the First World War, predominantly recruited from the towns to the north and west of Manchester (an area which was then in south-eastern Lancashire but has since become part of Greater Manchester). Many of the recruits signed up with neighbours, colleagues, social clubs, and other groups following the creation of the pals battalions. By the end of the war, it had grown to 30 battalions, including Territorial Force and New Army units. The 1st Battalion was stationed in Karachi at the outbreak of war in 1914 and was immediately shipped back to England and from there to the Mediterranean. It played a prominent role in the landing at Cape Helles (part of the Gallipoli Campaign, under the control of the 29th Division) on 25 April 1915, during which its members famously earned \\"six Victoria Crosses before breakfast\\". The Lancashire Fusiliers' beach was later named \\"Lancashire Landing\\". The 1st was transferred to France in March 1916. The 2nd Battalion was immediately posted to France and spent the remainder of its war on the Western Front, where it was involved in intense fighting. Its first engagement was the Battle of Le Cateau. The regular battalions were joined by multiple New Army battalions, some of which joined the fighting in France and Turkey, while others were held in reserve or posted to garrison ports around Britain. Both of the regular battalions and multiple territorial and New Army units participated in some of the largest battles of the war, including (among others) the Somme and Passchendaele (the Third Battle of Ypres).O'Neill, pp. 17‚Äì18.James, p. 53.Ray, p. 101.Ray, p. 109. Commissioning The memorial tablet placed by the crew of HMS Euryalus in St Mary's Church, Bury By the end of the war, 13,642 Lancashire Fusiliers had been killed, including 600 at Cape Helles alone. The regiment earned 18 Victoria Crosses (including the \\"six before breakfast\\"), more than any other infantry regiment. The loss of so many men, and the losses at Gallipoli in particular, deeply affected the local community in Lancashire and especially Bury, where the regiment was headquartered. A ceremony to commemorate the Cape Helles landing has taken place every year since 1916 in the parish church, which contains a memorial to the Lancashire Fusiliers' efforts at Cape Helles, placed by the crew of HMS Euryalus (which carried the bulk of the 1st battalion to Gallipoli).Ray, p. 108.Ray, p. 116. In light of the regiment's heavy losses, there was a strong feeling that their war efforts should be commemorated. This led Colonel George Wike to convene a meeting in Salford on 9 January 1919, where a committee was established with the mandate to raise ¬£30,000 for a permanent memorial and a compassionate fund for soldiers and their families. Lutyens first travelled to Bury in September 1920 at the invitation of Colonel Wike. In a letter to his wife, Emily, he described the town as a \\"desolate spot\\". He was received by Wike and a group of other colonels, and dined with several of the regiment's officers. While touring potential locations for the memorial, he proposed a site outside the regimental headquarters in Wellington Barracks, to which the committee agreed.Moorhouse, p. 180. Design The top of the obelisk showing the painted flags and the sculpted cap badge inside a laurel wreath. The memorial was built by John Tinline of Bury, a local stonemason. It consists of a single tall, tapering obelisk in Portland stone (similar to the pair on Lutyens' Northampton War Memorial) standing on a square base with a cornice where the two parts meet. Below the base is a carved frieze which sits on a pedestal of two rectangular blocks. The whole structure rests on a rectangular plinth and at the very bottom are two shallow circular steps. On the front and rear of the obelisk are carvings of the Lancashire Fusiliers' cap badge and the inscription \\"XX\\" (referring to the 20th Regiment of Foot, from which the Lancashire Fusiliers evolved) in gilded lettering, surrounded by a carved laurel wreath. On the front, below the wreath, the regiment's motto, OMNIA AUDAX (\\"daring in all things\\", awarded for the fusiliers' service in the Second Boer War), is inscribed. To either side are carved, painted flags: the King's Colour to the north (left when the memorial is viewed from the front) and the colour of 1st Battalion, the Lancashire Fusiliers to the south (right). The obelisk itself is tall and the whole memorial is tall.Borg, p. 88.Wyke & Cocks, p. 239.Corke, p. 55.Moorhouse, p. 37. The remaining inscriptions are all to the lower part of the structure. The dates of the First World War are carved just below the obelisk, and the dedication TO THE LANCASHIRE FUSILIERS THEIR DEEDS AND SACRIFICES FOR KING AND COUNTRY on the upper part of the pedestal. Below those, on the lower part of the pedestal and on the plinth, are later inscriptions: the dates of the Second World War and the further dedication AND ALL FUSILIERS WHO DIED IN SUBSEQUENT CAMPAIGNS (the latter added after the Lancashire Fusiliers' amalgamation in the 1960s). The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner opined that the memorial is one of the few beautiful public artefacts in an otherwise \\"drab\\" group of towns, and \\"more moving in its modesty\\" compared to some of Lutyens' grander designs for municipal war memorials.Pevsner, p. 183. History The memorial was unveiled by Lieutenant General Sir Henry de Beauvoir De Lisle‚Äîcommander of the 29th Division, under which the 1st battalion was organised‚Äîon 25 April 1922, specifically chosen as the seventh anniversary of the Cape Helles landing. The general gave a speech in which he referenced the Gallipoli landings and the \\"six Victoria Crosses (VCs) before breakfast\\", after which he performed the unveiling by the then-novel method of an electric button.Quinlan, p. 45. Lutyens was unable to attend the ceremony but sent a cable. Other dignitaries included several local mayors, Captain Richard Willis (recipient of one of the six VCs), three generals, and the Rector of Bury who led prayers. In addition to the memorial itself, spare funds were spent on drums and bugles for the regiment and donated to the fusiliers' compassionate fund out of a desire that the living benefit from the funds. The drums and bugles were formally presented to the regiment at the unveiling ceremony, at the conclusion of which the bugles were used to sound the Last Post.Moorhouse, p. 181. They are now on display in the Fusilier Museum, adjacent to the memorial's site in Bury.The Fusilier Museum, p. 19. Lutyens designed one other obelisk as a regimental memorial, the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry War Memorial in Cowley, Oxford, which was unveiled the year after the Lancashire Fusiliers' memorial. The two memorials are similar, though the OBLI's is more modestly decorated. The memorial in its modern setting in Gallipoli Gardens, outside the Fusilier Museum, in Bury town centre When the Lancashire Fusiliers were amalgamated with other fusilier regiments into the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers in 1968, the new regiment adopted the memorial and rededicated it to commemorate all fusiliers killed in the line of duty. It stood in its original location outside the regimental headquarters at Wellington Barracks for over 40 years, but the barracks closed with the amalgamation and were mostly demolished in the 1970s. As a result, the memorial was moved to the side of Bolton Road, outside the front gate of the former barracks. In 2009, Sparrow Park was redeveloped as Gallipoli Gardens and the Fusilier Museum moved there from the former regimental headquarters. The war memorial was dismantled and repaired before being re-installed next to the museum. Lutyens' grandson, Lord Ridley, unveiled the memorial in its new location on 27 September (the day before the official reopening of the museum), after which the Rector of Bury, the Reverend John Findon, led a dedicatory service. The Lancashire Fusiliers memorial was designated a grade II listed building on 2 September 1992. It was upgraded to grade II* in April 2015, along with Deal War Memorial in Kent and the memorial to the 29th Division (under which the 1st Battalion Lancashire Fusiliers was organised) at Stretton-on-Dunsmore in Warwickshire, to mark the centenary of the Gallipoli landings. Historic England further recognised the Lancashire Fusiliers memorial as part of a \\"national collection\\" of Lutyens' war memorials in November 2015. Listed building status offers legal protection from demolition or modification; grade II* is reserved for \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\" and applied to about 5.5% of listings.

Pardeep is one of the most prominent players in Pro Kabaddi and is currently the highest raid-point scorer in league history.He is the first to score 900 points in the vivo pkl kabaddi league in season 7. He led the Patna Pirates to three straight VIVO Pro Kabaddi titles between 2016‚Äì17 and holds a multitude of the league‚Äôs raiding records.  Early life  Pardeep Narwal was born in Rindhana village of Haryana's Sonipat district, where he started playing kabaddi.  Kabaddi career  Narwal made his debut in VIVO Pro Kabaddi with the Bengaluru Bulls against Patna Pirates in Season 2 and featured six times that campaign, scoring a total of nine raid points. Narwal moved to the Patna Pirates in Season 3 and blossomed into one of the best raiders in the league. He scored his first career Super 10 in the Pirates‚Äô 29-25 victory over Puneri Paltan in Kolkata, where he led both sides in scoring with 11 points on the night Alongside Rohit Kumar, Narwal formed the league‚Äôs most potent raiding duo, as the two combined to score 194 raid points in the league stage of the campaign, with Kumar scoring 102 of those in 12 matches and Narwal scoring 92 raid points in 14 matches. Narwal scored his fifth Super 10 of the season against Puneri Paltan in the semi-final but missed on the final through injury. The Pirates, however, triumphed over defending U Mumba by a scoreline of 31-28 and won their maiden VIVO Pro Kabaddi title. Following Rohit Kumar moves to the Bengaluru Bulls,Pardeep took over the responsibility of being the Pirates‚Äô lead raider and enjoyed another sensational campaign, scoring 107 raid points in 14 league stage matches with four Super 10s, the first of which came in narrow 36-34 win over U Mumba in Jaipur, where the raider scored, a match-high, 18 points. Narwal continued to carry the brunt of the raiding load in the playoffs and scored eight points in the Pirates‚Äô narrow 37-33 victory over Puneri Paltan in the semi-final, taking them to their second-straight VIVO Pro Kabaddi final. In the final against Jaipur Pink Panthers, Narwal unleashed a mammoth 16-point performance leading the Pirates to their second VIVO Pro Kabaddi title with a 37-29 victory and won their second VIVO Pro Kabaddi title in a row. Narwal‚Äôs third season with the Pirates was arguably the best ever by a player VIVO Pro Kabaddi history, as the raider notched up 369 raid points and led the league in every raiding category. Narwal scored a Super 10 in 19 off the 26 matches that he played in that campaign, managing one in each of Patna Pirates‚Äô first three matches. He followed it up with just one in the subsequent four matches but after that relatively lean patch, he embarked on a run of eight straight matches with a Super 10 that eventually ended against the Tamil Thalaivas where he fell just one point short of 10 raid points. After finishing second in the Zone B standing, Narwal and the Pirates battled Haryana Steelers in the Playoffs, where the raider scored, a VIVO Pro Kabaddi record, 34 raid points which included an eight-point raid, as the Pirates routed the Steelers 69-30. In Eliminator 3, Narwal yet again led by example, scoring 19 raid points in his team‚Äôs 42-32 win over Puneri Paltan. In Qualifier 2, Narwal scored 23 raid points against the Bengal Warriors in his team‚Äôs narrow 47-44 victory, helping the Pirates reach their third straight VIVO Pro Kabaddi final. Narwal continued his unbelievable form in the final, scoring 19 raid points against Gujarat Fortunegiants to lead the Pirates to a 55-38 victory and capture their third straight VIVO Pro Kabaddi title. Narwal scored a Super 10 in each of his team‚Äôs first three matches in Season 6 before falling short against the Telugu Titans. The next four matches also saw a similar trend for Narwal, as he scored three straight Super 10s before failing to do so against the same opponent in Patna. Narwal continued to string along quality performances but the Pirates struggled for form towards the latter end of the season and needed a big finish to their campaign to stand a chance to qualify for the Playoffs. Narwal scored three Super 10s in the Pirates final five matches of the season but the team failed to register a single win and crashed out in the league stage of the campaign for the first time in franchise history. In season 7, Narwal started slowly, but still became the first player to reach 1,000 points in the PKL. = International = Pardeep Narwal has featured regularly for the Indian kabaddi team since 2016 and has won gold in three of the four tournaments that he has played in.

In India, copper ore has been identified in varying structural formations as \\"host rocks\\" in several geological formations of different geological time scale. The resource has been identified and explored to varying degree in 14 states of the country such as Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Orissa, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand and West Bengal. Production Copper Vase which contained the 1821 Gold Coins of the Gupta Period found at Bayana, District Bharatpur, Rajasthan Mining is done by both opencast and underground methods. The major copper mines are the Khetri copper belt in Rajasthan, Singhbhum copper belt in Jharkhand and Malanjkhand copper belt in Madhya Pradesh which are mined by HCL; Singhbhum belt is mined by M/s Indian Copper Complex. While the Ingeldhal mine is operated by M/s Hutti Gold Mines Ltd, the Dikchu mine is in Sikkim under the Sikkim Mining Corporation (SMC). Mining production is just 0.2% of world's production, whereas refined copper production is about 4% of world's production. In 2011, according to the Ministry of Mines, India exported refined copper, which was initially done excursively by the mines owned by Hindustan Copper Ltd (HCL) (incorporated as Indian Copper Corporation Ltd. in 1972) since 1967, a Government of India undertaking. Now there are three more manufacturers in this field such as Hindalco Industries Ltd, Sterlite Industries Ltd and Jagadia Copper Ltd. However, HCL is the dominant industry which has wide range of production capability in mining, beneficiation, smelting, refining and continuous cast rod manufacturing. Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand are the only states involved in production of copper ore in the country. However, copper concentrates are imported by the Birla copper of Hindalco Industries Limited and Sterlite Industries Limited to produce copper metal located in the States of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, respectively. Global ranking is 4th in smelter production and 7th in refined copper consumption.

The park was opened in 2013 in Budapest's 17th district, in R√°koscsaba. The opening of the park made it possible for its founders to practice their favourite sport dirt jump legally.  The Park's Past  HiJackers Bike Park's history stretches back for years. In 2013 a group of local youths decided to establish a bike park in R√°koscsaba on an unbuilt parcel between Dunaszeg utca- Szabads√°g sug√°r√∫t and the R√°kospatak. The HiJackers crew first contacted two local foundations (R√°kosmenti Testedz≈ë K√∂r, K√∂ly√∂kkaland Alap√≠tv√°ny) which joined in the works connected to the parks establishment, and started transforming the above-mentioned area into a professional bike park. In a few months time an area of more than two acres was transformed into a shape suitable for practicing the sport. Soon a dream came true, the park was finally built as it was planned. As time went on the month June had arrived and HiJackers Bike Park officially opened its gates. Since then the bikers can fully enjoy their passion, and help others in getting to know the sport. The next milestone in the parks history was the Hijackers Dirt Jam which was organised on 27 September 2014. This was a competition between dozens of professional bikers. The event attracted viewers from many places across the country. Due to the huge success of the first Hijackers Dirt Jam a second one was organised on 5 September 2015. Despite the bad weather the second Hijackers Dirt Jam was also visited by a lot of people. In spring 2016 the founders of the park decided to make a smaller, so called pump track beside the bigger track where beginners can practice the sport. The smaller track only contains small waves and moderate turns. The beginners can learn the basics on this smaller track and it can also be used for competitions held for children.  Transportation  The park is located beside the R√°kospatak right beside a bicycle lane leading into central parts of Budapest. The park can also be approached by bus and it is also close to the R√°koscsaba train station. The park can be reached by getting of the following buses at the Szabads√°g sug√°r√∫t bus station: * from K≈ëb√°nya by buses 162, 201E, 262; * from √ñrs vez√©r tere by buses 161, 169E; * from P√©cel by bus 169E; * and at night by bus 990.

He was a founder member of the Uganda National Congress, which eventually became UPC, under Apollo Obote. He also served on the National Executive Committee in between 1980 and 1985. He was a practicing Anglican Christian. Early life Yowabu Magada Kawaluuko nicknamed commander was born on 7 January 1930. to Enos Muwalu Kizige, a farmer, and Amina Kawala Namusubo Tibagonzeka, a house wife, of Nabirumba village, Kamuli district, Uganda. The second born after his older brother Samuel who was born ten years prior (born 1920), Kawaluuko attended Nabirumba Church Of Uganda Primary School, after which he went to Balawoli, Kaliro, and then to Namulikya where he sat his Primary Leaving Examinations. Yowabu went on to attend Bishop Willis Teacher Training College and later to Kaliro where he trained as vernacular teacher in 1951. Kawaluuko taught in Kagulu, Kigingi, Nsale, Irundu, Bugaya, Buyende and Nabirumba, first as a grade 3 teacher, deputy and then head teacher, before his retirement in 1993 at the age of 63.

His death came as complete shock to most, despite his ill health and it led to complete out pouring of grief seen in the tens of thousands of people that descended on Nabirumba village, Kamuli, Uganda to pay their last respects, effectively turning the place into a temporary shrine.

However, by the 1950s they were viewed by Monaco's Consultative Committee on Public Works as a social anachronism. While recent years have seen a renewed appreciation within the Principality for villa architecture, the number of historic villas remaining declines each year. In 1954 the Principality possessed 688 villas;Laplace, Pierre Villas Les Anciennes et leurs H√¥tes √† Monaco, Editions V. Gadoury, Monaco, 2015, p1 only a small fraction of that number still survive. Heritage and its recognition Monaco-Ville The urban history of Monaco and its villas has, until recently, been subject to poor documentation and archiving. As of 2016, Monaco still had no official preservation laws governing historic buildings. In 1960 Prince Rainier III established the Monaco Economic Development Corporation to attract new business to the Principality. It was successful in this, but the influx of new investors and workers resulted in a wave of demolitions of Belle Epoque villas to enable the construction of apartments and new hotels.Ring, Jim Riviera: The Rise and Rise of the C√¥te d'Azur, Faber & Faber, London 2011 Following major development in the 1970s, Prince Rainier III banned high rise development in the Principality. However, his successor, Prince Albert II, overturned the Sovereign Order. This, and a further influx of new residents, accelerated the destruction of the architectural heritage of single family villas for new luxury apartments.Lyall, Sarah; Baume, Ma√Øa de la Development Blitz Provokes a Murmur of Dissent in Monaco, New York Times, 11 December 2013; https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/12/world/europe/development-blitz-provokes-a- murmur-of-dissent-in-monaco.html Demands for affordable public housing led to further villa demolitions. In 2013, an official publication documenting the urban history of the Principality called it a place where \\"architecture is temporary\\". In a nation where public dissent is rare, there was significant criticism of the destruction. The 2013 demolition of the Art Deco Sporting d'Hiver (\\"Winter Sporting\\") Club building, and the rotunda of the H√¥tel de Paris and its 1900 extensions, caused further dismay,Monaco's Heritage In Danger?, L'Observateur de Monaco, No141, April 2015; http://www.lobservateurdemonaco.mc/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Obs141.pdf and the establishment of protest group \\"Monaco Patrimoine\\", whose leader was quoted as saying: \\"Monaco is destroying, without scruples, villas from the Belle Epoque‚Ä¶Monaco is losing its identity\\", and it was termed \\"a genocide of memories\\". In 2015, a major row broke out between the Government and the elected National Council over the demolition of the picturesque Belle Epoque- style 1931 apartment building Le Palais de la Plage (37 Avenue Princesse Grace ‚Äì originally Boulevard des Bas-Moulins), which sat on the beachfront, and was replaced by an apartment building of the same name. The President of the Cultural and Heritage Mission of the National Council, Daniel Bo√©ri, termed the demolition \\"brutal\\", and that Monegasque citizens were being treated by the Government as \\"children incapable of reason\\". While a heritage law and Heritage Institute was still in planning, he said: \\"That we are still at this point in 2015 is breathtaking... The example of the Palais de la Plage is a perfect illustration of its absolute necessity.\\" In 2015, it was revealed that Monaco state officials had, in a town planning document, identified 93 'remarkable' buildings and 29 'remarkable' facades worth preserving. However, these are to be re-evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The list also offered no guarantee of protection and was criticised for its major absences, including entire streets, and the Hotel de Paris, the Sporting d'Hiver, and the Hermitage.Monaco's Heritage In Danger?, L'Observateur de Monaco, No141, April 2015, pp60-67;http://www.lobservateurdemonaco.mc/wp- content/uploads/2015/09/Obs141.pdf Significant losses * 2009 ‚Äì three villas for construction of the Odeon Tower apartment tower, including \\"Villa Le Pavillon\\", 34 Avenue de l'Annonciade. * 2011 ‚Äì Villa du Royan and Villa Rignon at 12 and 14 Rue Bel Respiro for apartments. * 2013 ‚Äì six villas in rue des Girofl√©es: 1a \\"Villa La Lucioles\\", 7 \\"Villa Mancoz\\", 8 \\"Villa Les Panoramas\\",10 \\"Villa Lisette\\",12 \\"Villa Le Clos Fleuri\\" and 14 \\"Villa La Th√©ba√Øde\\"; demolished for 'Les Girofl√©es' apartment tower, at 1 Rue des Girofl√©es. \\"Villa Unda Maris\\" (originally \\"Villa Saint Martin\\"), Avenue Saint Martin; demolished for apartments of the same name. * 2014 ‚Äì six villas in a triangular site bordered by Rue des Agaves and Rue Augustin Vento for the Stella apartments and offices, 6 Rue Augustin Vento.

It was released on July 27, 2016, under Warner Music Japan. Background and development Two years prior to the release of the album, Lee composed a blues song; his bandmates encouraged him to utilize the song for his solo album. In expressing his desire to release music independent from CNBLUE, Lee expected to collaborate with a different band instead of releasing a solo album. He worked with several composers in order to include a multitude of sounds which deviated from CNBLUE's music. Lee asked bandmate Jung Yong-hwa to compose a song for the album, which did not come to fruition due to Jung's filming schedule. The lead single for Sparklight Night was determined by the record label via voting between two songs; \\"Moonlight Swing\\" was ultimately selected. Music structure Dealing with eternal love, \\"Moonlight Swing\\" is a swing music song which incorporates elements of big band and emits a \\"fairy tale-like\\" atmosphere. Initially a song about remaining \\"pure and honest like Peter Pan\\", Lee made the decision to change \\"Moonlight Swing\\" into a love song in order to create a more relatable track. Release and promotion Sparkling Night was announced as Lee's debut Japanese-language studio album on June 8, 2016, with a release date of July 27.

It is located in the Trans-Ili Alatau mountains, 15 km south from the center of Almaty in Kazakhstan. The lake is 2511 meters above sea level  Characteristics  The basin of the lake has tectonic origin with complex shape and general slope to the north. The lake is 1.6 km in length and from 0.75 to 1 km in width. The coastline is 3 km, the depth is 30‚Äì40 m, the volume of water mass is about 14 million m¬≥. The maximum water level is in August, the minimum is in February. Level fluctuations reach 20 m. Lakeside is abrupt and steep. From the south, the lake flows into the river Big Almaty. It is part of the Ile-Alatau National Park.  Description  Like the vast majority of lakes in the Tien Shan mountains, the lake appeared as a result from number of earthquakes. Above the lake rise the three main peaks that can be seen from the northern end of the dam: the peak of Councils (4317 m) - on south-east, the peak Ozerny (4110 m) - on the south and the peak Tourist (3954 m) - on the south-west of the lake. Big Almaty Lake is located at an altitude of 2511m on the upper side of the Almaty canyon. The Almaty River runs through it. It is located 2.511m above sea level. There are three peaks Sovetov (4,317 m), Ozyorny (4,110 m), and Turist (3,954 m) surrounding the lake, which can be seen from the northern end of the dam. The lake is made up of glacial water and is 1.6 km long, 1 km wide, and approximately 40m deep. Turist, a 3,681m high pyramid, is the crest of Bolshoi Almaty Peak and is visible from the city center. The domed Tien Shan Astronomical Observatory is located higher up above the chalice of the lake (which is open to the public and includes tourist accommodation). The lake's high altitude location keeps the area at cool temperatures throughout the year. Depending on the time of year, the lake changes its color from light-green to turquoise-blue. Tourism The lake is a major source of drinking water for the region. People can access the lake by car (approximately 1 hour drive from the city center), bike, or hiking (approximately a half-day trip). The lake is 15 km away from the city. Access to the lake requires payment of a fee to enter the national park (~450KZT in October 2019). The lake's average water temperature is 8-10 C, and swimming is prohibited as the lake is the main source of drinking water for Almaty.

In the late 1920s and early 1930s, girls in schools was a new thing, but Zeng was a member of the girls' basketball team in school. She became a \\"student soldier\\" in a branch campus of Whampoa Military Academy. Zeng was one of the first female soldiers in China during the Revolution. After the establishment of the Communist State, she spent over 40 years working in the All-China Women's Federation. She devoted all her life to the Chinese women's rights movement. Biography =Early life and education= Young Zeng Xianzhi Zeng was born on January 23, 1910, at Baishutang () in Changsha, Hunan, with her ancestral home in Xiangxiang (now Shuangfeng County). She was a descendant of Zeng Guoquan, a renowned general in the late Qing Empire and one of three brothers of Zeng Guofan. She had five siblings. Her siblings were, in order of birth: Zeng Xianpu (; 1908-1966), Zeng Xiankai (; 1908-1985), Zeng Xianzhen (; 1911-1997), Zeng Xianzhu (; 1919-1986), and Zeng Xianju ().

In 1926, she was accepted to the Wuhan Central Military and Political Academy. Whilst still nominally at school she participated in the Northern Expedition. =Revolutionary career= In 1927, Zeng went to Guangzhou to help organize the Guangzhou Uprising. She joined the Communist Party of China in 1928. She was a member of the Communist underground party in Shanghai under \\"legal\\" cover as a student of South China University.

This was China's first national congress for women and 500 delegates heard Mao Zedong tell them to increase production and to demand their rights.First National Congress of Chinese Women, WSIC, Retrieved 1 September 2016 After the congress Zeng worked in the All-China Women's Federation until the Cultural Revolution. During the Cultural Revolution, she was called a \\"big black umbrella\\" () and \\"alien-class element\\" () by the Communist government, and she was sent to the May Seventh Cadre Schools in Hengshui County, Hebei to be re-educated and to do farm work. In 1974, after seeing his mother's unfair treatment, Ye Xuanning wrote a letter to Mao Zedong who approved Zeng's return to Beijing.

Bruna dedicated her entire life to the care of the ill working in hospitals in Zaragoza and during times of war risked her life to aid others. Internal complications and a range of outside interferences saw Bruna be appointed to and resign from various leadership positions and she was captured - though later released - during the Carlist War. Bruna was considered a saint after her death which led to the commencement of her canonization cause under Pope Pius XI on 6 August 1931 while being titled as Venerable under Pope John Paul II in 1991 who also beatified her on 16 October 1994 at Saint Peter's Square. Life Mar√≠a Rafols Bruna was born in Barcelona on 5 November 1781 as the sixth of ten children to the middle-class Crist√≥bal Rafols Cunillera and Margarita Bruna Brugol. Her father found work as a miller. In May 1873 she and her relations relocated to La Bleda where - on 27 May 1785 - she received the sacrament of Confirmation from the Carmelite Bishop of Barcelona Gabino Valladares. Bruna completed her education at a boarding school in Barcelona. In 1792 she moved once again to the town of Santa Margherita where her little brother Juan died in 1793 - five siblings of hers died sometime in their childhoods - while two uncles died sometime between 1793 and 1794. Her father died on 10 July 1794. Bruna later joined a group of twelve women placed under the direction of Juan Bonal Cortada who administered in a small Zaragoza hospital and arrived there in December 1804 to the hospital of Nuestra Se√±ora de Gracia. The group dedicated itself to children who were abandoned as well as the disabled and those with mental conditions. She helped Cortada mold that small group into a religious order that she helped him to co-found on 28 December 1804. In 1806 she became the superior - a position that often put her into conflict with the hospital workers. During the Napoleonic Wars she worked in the bombed ruins in order to save children and to tend to ill people. On 4 August 1808 the hospital the sisters were working in was bombed so the group had to take refuge elsewhere. The French withdrew on 14 August 1808 but later began another siege on 10 December 1808. Bruna even ventured into the French camp after the second bombing hit in order to plead with General Jean Lannes for his help in tending to the ill and the wounded. Bruna resigned as president of the hospital's board on 12 November 1811 and then made a trip to Orcajo in Daroca. She became superior once more on 10 August 1812 after a new constitution for the order came into effect though she was later forced to resign after internal difficulties. She was later appointed once again as superior and held that from 1826 until 1829. Bruna - alongside other women - made her vows into their order on 16 July 1825. The outbreak of the Carlist War saw her arrested on 11 May 1834 on the charge of acting against Queen Isabel II and was imprisoned and exiled in Huesca. But after a period of imprisonment - where she met Dominican friars - she was later released on 11 May 1835. Bruna was later allowed to return to Zaragoza in 1841 after being confined in exile in her hometown since her release and in 1845 asked to retire though continued to still pursue the order's work. The order received papal approval from Pope Leo XIII on 14 January 1898 after providing the congregation with the decree of praise on 13 April 1889. The order's constitutions received initial approval in 1883 and then went on to receive the full papal approval of Pope Pius X on 11 March 1904. Beatification The beatification process commenced in Zaragoza in an informative process that Archbishop Rigoberto Dom√©nech Valls inaugurated on 1 July 1926 and later closed on 28 January 1927 after the process finished its business. Theologians then collated her writings in order to examine whether or not such spiritual writings were orthodox in nature - the theologians issued their approval to them on 30 March 1931. The apostolic process would span from 30 May 1932 until its closure on 21 May 1934. The Congregation of Rites later validated these previous processes on 25 June 1940. The formal introduction to the cause came on 6 August 1931 under Pope Pius XI after Bruna was titled as a Servant of God. In 1944 the cause was suspended under Pope Pius XII for unknown reasons though Pope John Paul II authorized the cause's resumption in 1980. The postulation was then able to submit the Positio to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in 1989 for their assessment and led to the approval of the cause from a team of theologians on 9 November 1990. The C.C.S. then met and approved the dossier's contents on 6 July 1991. John Paul II proclaimed her to be Venerable on 6 July 1991 after confirming that Bruna had led a life of heroic virtue. The miracle required for beatification was investigated in the diocese of its origin and received C.C.S. validation in Rome on 3 December 1992. A medical board approved the healing to be a miracle on 12 February 1993 while theologians likewise came to the same conclusion on 23 April 1993. The cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. followed suit on 22 June 1993 and passed it to the pope on 6 July 1993 for his final approval. John Paul II beatified Bruna in Saint Peter's Square on 16 October 1994.

(Original description) The elongate shell is, dark fleshy brown, with large white riblike nodules and a white infra-sutural line. It contains 10 whorls. The apical ones of the holotype are a little eroded and smooth. The next two whorls show rather indistinct ribs, the rest conspicuous white nodules, which become larger up to the body whorl. On this whorl, which is somewhat oblique, they are smaller on the ventral side. It shows a very large nodule before the aperture and a second row of much smaller ones, which are not visible on the upper whorls. The surface of the shell is covered with faint spiral lirae, which are more distinct on the nodules. They suture is linear, irregular in consequence of the nodules of which there are 9 on the body whorl, besides 12 of the second row, and 6 or 7 on the upper whorls, where they occupy nearly the whole breadth, except a narrow zone at the upper part of each whorl. The aperture is rather small, the interior white with fleshy brown spots near the margin. The sinus is large, rounded and not deep,. The outer lip is thin, arcuate and prominent, slightly crenulate. The siphonal canal is very short and large. The columella is slightly curved, with a brown callosity, its lower extremity produced, near the suture with a strong tubercle.Schepman, M.M.

The Gibraltar national football team represents the Gibraltar in association football and is controlled by the Gibraltar Football Association (GFA), the governing body of the sport there. It competes as a member of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), which encompasses the countries of Europe. Organised football has been played in the country since the 19th century. Gibraltar first applied for UEFA membership in 1997 but was rejected because of intense opposition from Spain. In October 2012, Gibraltar reapplied for full membership and it was granted in March 2013. On 13 May 2016 Gibraltar was accepted as a member of the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA); this was after their original application in 2014 was denied. The list encompasses the unofficial matches played by the team since 1993. There are three types of unofficial matches: any match that was played by the senior Gibraltar national team before joining UEFA in 2013, any match played by the development team (such as the team representing Gibraltar in the Men's Football at the 2015 Island Games) or any friendly match played against a club team. The team's largest unofficial victory came on 29 June 2003 when they defeated Sark by nineteen goals to nil. Their worst loss is 5‚Äì0 against Greenland in 1993.

friends, trade, build worlds and engage in player versus player combat. The game was released for Android in November 2012, and has been released for iOS, Android, Microsoft Windows, macOS, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. As of February 28, 2017, an Ubisoft acquirement of Growtopia was announced and was completed during Ubisoft's 2016-17 fourth quarter, with the original developers being design and general advisors to the game's continued development. Growtopia utilizes the freemium model. Gameplay Growtopia is a 2D massively multiplayer online sandbox video game based around the idea that most of the in-game items can be grown from seeds of trees. The game has no end goals or 100% completion, however, there is an achievement system and quests to complete from non-player characters. A new player is sent to a private world called Tutorial, which teaches the basics of the game through reading tips with an item called the Growpedia. The player starts out with two basic tools: a fist for punching and breaking blocks, and a wrench for wrenching items and edit items' properties. After a player finished Tutorial, they are sent to Start for learning more about the game. Players can visit other people's worlds or create their own worlds. When a player creates a new world, the world will be procedurally generated. Worlds in Growtopia have the same size, with the exception special worlds created by the original developers (such as the world Tiny). Players can break and build blocks, get seeds or gems from blocks, plant seeds, and harvest trees. Players cannot do these activities if the world or the area they are punching is locked by someone else. Players can lock areas they want by using different sizes of locks: Small Lock, Big Lock, Huge Lock, and World Lock (there are also other types of locks such as Diamond Locks, which have the same function as World Locks). The game also contains some special types of locks which changes certain aspects of how the world functions. When a player has locked an area with a lock, the player can access other people to the lock or edit properties by wrenching the lock. Development Production of Growtopia started in 2012, when designer Seth Robinson made six mockup screenshots outlining the premise of the game of which he originally called Buildo, and sent it to Mike Hommel to entice him into helping with the project. The game user interface started to take shape with Hommel's mockups. On October 22, 2012, Hommel uploaded a video on his YouTube channel showing the development of the game before its release. During initial development, Robinson and Hommel brought in the help of composer Cory Mollenhour to produce Growtopia soundtrack. After three months of development, the game was released on Android as a free beta on November 30, 2012, under the name Growtopia. They moved the game out of beta and release the full version on January 9, 2013. The game has been updated since the release. On February 28, 2017, Ubisoft announced an acquisition of Growtopia. The transaction was completed during Ubisoft's 2016-17 fourth quarter, under the terms that the original developers would continue being both design and general advisors to the game's continued development. A North American community management and moderation team was set up after Ubisoft's acquisition. They handed responsibility of the game's future development over to their Ubisoft Abu Dhabi team. The team has been working continuously on Growtopia ever since. Release The game can be played on multiple operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android. The iOS version was released on January 11, 2013, after the initial release for Android on November 30, 2012. Following these mobile releases, the game was brought to computers; a Windows beta version was released on July 9, 2013, and a macOS version was released on July 27, 2013. Growtopia was available for a period of time on the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, from July 18, 2019, to July 30, 2020, before being discontinued in order to \\"allocate all resources back to support the Mobile and PC version\\". The decision to discontinue all console support was declared on April 27, 2020, and had followed from a previous announcement on January 19, 2020, which had notified the community there would no longer be major updates or annual events for the consoles platforms, as their team only had \\"limited resources available\\". An Ubisoft Abu Dhabi team member stated that since there were \\"many, many more players playing on Android, iOS, and PC\\", they were going to focus their resources back towards those platforms. Reception Growtopia received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews from critics according to review aggregator GameRankings. Jay Is Games described the game as \\"simple and easy enough to work on the mobile platform (and be fun for kids), but with enough room for customization and socialization\\". 148Apps gave the game a 4/5, saying \\"the crafting mechanic is unique\\". Pocket Gamer's Peter Willington scored the game 6 out of 10, said he dislikes the crude menus, the UI is bland and cramped and hates the character design. TouchArcade wrote \\"With online games like this that take place in persistent worlds where everyone can interact, you‚Äôll no doubt get some people trying to destroy things and generally make life tough for everyone else\\".

Phuthi Nakene plays Matilda. Plot In 1950s Sophiatown, South Africa, a man forces his wife to treat her lover's suit as if it were a person, with tragic consequences. The film opens with a prologue in which Spokes Mashiyane's \\"Come Back\\" plays from an old radio in a bedroom. In a montage of shots, a person dresses: a hand removes a suit from a cupboard, the same hand polishes shoes, brushes trousers, fastens cufflinks, buttons up a jacket and finally adjusts a tie. Philemon, a middle-class lawyer awakens his sleeping wife Matilda, whom he calls Tilly, in their bedroom, with breakfast in bed. He is dressed in a suit and carries a fedora. The married couple lives in Sophiatown, a township of Johannesburg, in the early 1950s, shortly before the apartheid regime forcibly removed non-whites from the area to make way for white resettlement under the Group Areas Act and the Natives Resettlement Act, 1954. She kisses him and adjusts his tie as he tells her that he better go or he will be late for work. She kisses him again for longer, then he leaves the house. Matilda climbs out of bed and walks to the bedroom window, watching Philemon walk away, then she turns back and gazes at the empty, lonely house. Philemon walks down a busy street as a caption appears on screen saying: Sophiatown, Johannesburg, 1955. At a bus-stop, under a sign that reads: Native Bus Stop, Philemon meets his old friend Mr. Maphikela who appears to be anxious because he drops his briefcase as Philemon attempts to shake his hand. Their bus arrives and the two men board. On the bus, Mr. Maphikela reluctantly informs Philemon that Matilda has been visited by a young man every morning for the last three months. Devastated, Philemon tells Maphikela that he has to go and he hurries off the bus as Maphikela tells him to keep steady. As Philemon alights from the bus, another passenger boards the bus. The white bus conductor yells at the passenger in colloquial Afrikaans: \\"Nie-blankes, upstairs!\\", which means: \\"Non-whites, upstairs!\\" because public amenities, like buses, were segregated under apartheid. As the bus pulls off, Maphikela watches Philemon marching past other pedestrians. In a montage of shots, Matilda pours two glasses of whiskey, flirts and dances with a shirtless young man as Spokes Mashiyane's \\"Zoo Lake Jive\\" plays from a gramophone. In the same montage, Philemon marches through the streets of Sophiatown, loosening his tie aggressively and bumping into other pedestrians. The montage ends as Matilda kisses the young man and Philemon reaches the front door of his house. He opens the door, shuts it behind him, puts his briefcase down on the floor, then inhales deeply, gathering himself. Philemon walks deliberately to the bedroom where he discovers Matilda asleep in the arms of her lover. Philemon's face fills with rage. He notices the lover's suit hanging on the cupboard door. Philemon controls his anger and ambles to the cupboard, searching through it. He pretends as if he has not noticed the lovers in bed, and tells Matilda that he was nearly at work when he realised that he had left his pass at home so he returned to fetch it. While saying so, Philemon drapes the lover's suit over his arm. Matilda and her lover wake with a start. The lover rushes to the window, completely naked, then leaps out of it, fleeing down the street. Philemon treads purposefully to the window, watching the man running away, then locks it. Philemon tells Matilda that he must phone his boss to let him know that he will not come in to work today as his wife is unwell. While Philemon phones his boss, Matilda dresses quickly in her nightgown and waits anxiously on the bed. Philemon returns and regards the suit. He tells Matilda that he notices that they have a visitor. Philemon commands Matilda to treat the suit with the same hospitality that she would show to a guest: it will share meals with them, it will share their bedroom, it will go for walks with them, etc. If she refuses, he says that he will kill her. For the first time in his life, Philemon goes to a shebeen (an illegal speakeasy). While Spokes Mashiyane's \\"Kwela Zulu\\" plays, the shebeen queen removes alcohol (the sale of which was prohibited to blacks) from below a trap-door in a side-room then brings a bottle to Philemon as he smokes. Philemon stays at the shebeen all day, leaving Matilda alone with her thoughts and fears. When Philemon returns, he finds that Matilda has cleaned and spruced up their dingy home. She even wears a beautiful new dress and has prepared dinner. Unmoved, Philemon scolds his wife: where is their visitor? Matilda retrieves the suit and prepares a plate of food for it. Philemon instructs her how she should place the suit at the table so that it becomes indeed the third person. Matilda is petrified and scurries about as he barks orders. While Philemon eats, Matilda edges towards the window and opens it to get some air. But Philemon walks up and locks it from behind her then orders her to return to the table while he finishes his meal. This is how it should be from now on, Philemon tells her. They wash their plates and cutlery at the kitchen sink in silence, the suit hanging on the wall beside Matilda. Later, in the sitting room, Matilda irons the suit as Philemon smokes ominously behind her. On a Sunday, Philemon and Matilda walk to church. Matilda is deeply humiliated as she has to carry the suit slung over her shoulder. On the way, the couple walks past a wall on which a slogan has been painted: Ons Dak Nie, Ons Phola Hier, which is Tsotsitaal for We Won't Leave, We Are Staying Here.http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/destruction-sophiatown Philemon and Matilda enter the Anglican Church of Christ the King in Ray Street (which is incidentally the same street in which the writer Can Themba lived at Number 111). Above the altar is a conspicuous statue of a black Jesus. Philemon and Matilda are seated at a pew with the suit over the seat between them. Matilda's church friend arrives late with her husband and asks Matilda if they can sit beside her. Matilda looks to Philemon for permission but he glares at her. Matilda tells her church friend that someone else is seated there so her church friend tells her not to worry, that they will find seats elsewhere. After the service, Matilda's best friend Sane asks Matilda whether she will join her at choir practice from which she has been absent for a while. Matilda again looks to Philemon for permission and he says that he does not see why she should not go. Sane's husband Vuzi asks Philemon whether the suit that is slung over Matilda's shoulder is a new suit and compliments him by saying it looks stylish. Philemon scowls at Matilda as they leave the church. Back home, Philemon reads in the sitting room. When Matilda attempts to sit beside him, he tells her to go put the fellow to rest, referring to the suit which she is carrying. Later, Philemon finds Matilda lying on the bed sobbing as she caresses the suit. He tosses some money at her and tells her to prepare a dinner for her friends because she should not mope around all day. But he reminds her to take the suit with her, which he sarcastically refers to as their visitor. Matilda sings \\"Amazing Grace\\" with a choir of wives at the cultural club of the Anglican Mission. The suit hangs conspicuously on a hat stand beside them. The song continues over a montage of shots. Matilda goes to buy provisions for her dinner party. On her way home, carrying the suit, she walks past a political rally where the speaker calls the crowd to resist the forced removals by insisting that they will not move. The speaker shouts the popular Zulu and Xhosa rallying cry: Amandla! (The power!) and the crowd replies with the traditional: ‚ÄúNghawethu!\\" (Is ours!). As a turkey cooks in the oven, Matilda dances with the suit to Spokes Mashiyane's \\"Zoo Lake Jive\\". Knocks sound from the front door. Philemon yells from the sitting room that Matilda must get the door but she does not hear him above the music. Philemon continues to yell, but Matilda still does not hear him. Finally, Philemon storms into the room and Matilda bumps into him with a fright as the music stops suddenly. Matilda rushes to the front door and opens to see Sane, Vuzi and two other friends. Matilda serves her friends turkey at the dinner table. Philemon demands that she fetches their guest of honour. Matilda begs him to let it go just this once but he raises his voice. Deeply humiliated, Matilda serves the suit a meal in front of her friends. Eventually, Vuzi asks what is going on. Philemon tells Vuzi to ask Matilda, as she \\"knows the fellow best\\". Matilda brushes it off by saying that it is just a silly game that she and her husband play at meal-times. The guests chuckle, but as Matilda continues to serve the suit a meal, the dinner continues with the proverbial awkward silence as Matilda's friends watch her with bewildered amusement. After the uncomfortable dinner, the friends decide to go to a local shebeen to dance. Matilda is about to follow them out of the house when Philemon steps in front of her and commands her to put the suit to bed. Philemon leaves with the friends, leaving Matilda standing alone in the doorway. As she presses the suit to her breast, we see her from behind in the empty entrance-way. While Philemon dances with the friends at the smoky shebeen to the tune of Spokes Mashiyane's \\"Phatha Phatha\\", we return to the prologue in which a person dresses: a hand removes a suit from a cupboard, the same hand polishes shoes, brushes trousers, fastens cufflinks, buttons up a jacket. Finally, we realise that the person now fully dressed in the suit is in fact Matilda, though we do not see her face, and the tie is attached to the rafters of the bedroom. Back at the shebeen, Philemon is seated, contemplating his punishment of Matilda, as the music and sounds fade to a muffle. Gradually, Billie Holiday's \\"Strange Fruit\\" fades in as Philemon scratches his brow and the song continues to play as Philemon staggers home in the early hours of the morning. \\"Strange Fruit\\" was popular in Sophiatown at the time due to the gradual entrenchment of apartheid laws. Matilda steps up onto a crate, then kicks it out from underneath her and she hangs herself. Philemon enters the bedroom and falls to his knees below Matilda's hanging feet as he shouts her name repeatedly. \\"Strange Fruit\\" continues to play over the end credits of the film.

Vasu, starring Raghava Lawrence, Ritika Singh and Vadivelu in the leading roles. A remake of Vasu's earlier 2016 Kannada film of the same name, the project began production in July 2016. It was dubbed in Hindi as Kanchana Returns. Plot Raheem (Shakthi Vasudevan) and his well-trained pigeon Saara are alone in a coach aboard a train when a blind man enters and reaches an open door. Raheem saves the man, but the man turns out to be an assassin and throws Raheem off the moving train to his death. Raheem's death is ruled a suicide, but Raheem's fianc√©e Sangeetha (Saara Deva) knows that Raheem had no reason to kill himself. The same night, Raheem appears in Sangeetha's dream and says that he was murdered. The following day, Raheem's case is forwarded to the CBCID at Sangeetha's request. Shivalingeshwaran aka Shiva (Raghava Lawrence) is a strict CID officer who is married to a thrill-seeker named Sathya (Ritika Singh). The two live in a house that is near a cemetery. Shiva is assigned to Raheem's case and begins the investigation. The same night, Sathya sees a ghost of a child, and is frightened by this. However, Shiva cannot see the ghost and thinks that Sathya is imagining it. Then he appoints Pattukunjam (Vadivelu), a thief who comes to that house as a servant and night watchman. The following day, Shiva visits Raheem's home to investigate Raheem's relationship with his father and with Sangeetha. Shiva suspects Sangeetha's father Krishnamoorthy (Radha Ravi) is responsible for Raheem's death as he disapproved Raheem & Sangeetha's love, only to find out that he has nothing to do with Raheem's death. Sathya's behavior becomes erratic. She travels around the city in search of someone and she's redecorated the house with green curtains and lights, and she has cooked Biriyani, even though she has no experience in cooking. Pattukunjam and a few other maids inform Shiva about Sathya's strange behavior. Shiva meets his friend and psychiatrist, Ashok who advises Shiva to observe her behavior secretly. That night, Shiva returns home early. He hears a man's voice and smells a cigar burning. He heads to Sathya's room and is shocked to discover that Raheem's soul has possessed Sathya's body. Raheem warns Shiva, that he must solve Raheem's murder. Shiva accesses the security footage at the railway station and discovers that a person, who was acting as a blind man is the killer. Shiva tracks down the killer and chases him, finally cornering him on a train coach with no passengers. Sathya, who is still possessed by Raheem, enters and demands to know why the man killed him. The man tries to escape by jumping out of the moving train, but falls to his death. Shiva takes Sathya to a Darga, informing only Sathya's mother Sarala (Bhanupriya) about what has been happening. Baba (Pradeep Rawat) helps them to exorcise Raheem's soul out, but only temporarily. He tells Shiva that solving Raheem's case is the only solution for saving Sathya. Shiva starts the investigation piece by piece, and Raheem's pigeon Saara helps Shiva by giving clues. Shiva interrogates Sathya at the CID Conference Hall about Raheem. It is then revealed that Raheem recovered Sathya's stolen iPad and returned it to her. Raheem refuses to even tell his name, so Sathya clicks a picture of him for the sake of his noble gesture. Sathya's stalker college mate sees this and feels jealous. So he makes a call to Sathya's residential landline and when her father Viswanathan (Jayaprakash) answers, he purposefully plants wrong information that Sathya and Raheem are planning to elope and marry. Hearing this, Viswanathan hires David, an assassin to injure and cripple Raheem. After unveiling the truth about the mistaken identity, the ghost of Raheem possesses Sathya and threatens everyone present in the hall. Sathya's father begs for his forgiveness and tells that he intended to only harm Raheem, not to kill him. Shiva also begs Raheem to leave Sathya's body and asks Raheem to possess him instead, promising to show the killer. Then, it is revealed that a pigeon race organizer (Zakir Hussain), came to know about David's assignment to injure Raheem and paid David more money to kill him, since Raheem and Saara are his nemesis in the pigeon race and the duo wins every single game. The organizer is insulted by his friends for his incapability. The possessed Shiva kills all the henchmen, while allowing Raheem to exit his body and possess and kills the pigeon race organiser. In the end credits, Shiva and a pregnant Sathya get reunited.

Vasu in a cameo appearance in song Saarah Saarah Production Following the success of P. Vasu's Kannada horror film, Shivalinga (2016), the filmmaker chose to remake the project in Tamil. Vasu initially tried to market the project as Chandramukhi 2, as a spiritual sequel to Chandramukhi (2005), and approached Rajinikanth to portray the lead role. However, the actor did not accept to work on the project, while reports suggested that Vasu may approach Ajith Kumar for the film. In March 2016, Raghava Lawrence accepted to work on the film, while Vadivelu was also signed on to appear in a role thereafter. After negotiations with Anushka Shetty and Hansika Motwani, Vasu chose to sign on Ritika Singh for the female lead role. Vasu's son, Shakthi was also added to the cast to reprise the role he had portrayed in the original version. Shakthi revealed that his character would have more prominence in the Tamil version, in comparison with the Kannada version. The film was launched in a ceremony during mid July 2016, with Radharavi, Bhanupriya and Urvashi revealed to be a part of the cast. The film's first schedule was completed in Chennai during August 2016. Reception The Hindustan Times gave the move a 2 out of 5 star review.

As a two-year-old he was undefeated in three races including the Prix Eclipse and Prix Thomas Bryon and was rated the best colt of his age in Europe. In 1973 won the Prix Djebel on his seasonal debut but won only minor race from four subsequent starts. As a breeding stallion he was best known as the sire of All Along who won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and was named American Horse of the Year in 1983. Background Targowice was a \\"most attractive\\" bay horse with a white sock on his left foreleg bred in Kentucky by Kerr Stable. He was sold for $49,000 as a foal and acquired by the Wertheimer family: he raced in the colours of Germaine, the widow of Pierre Wertheimer. The colt was sent to Europe and entered training with Alec Head in France and was ridden in most of his races by his trainer's son Freddy. He was sired by Round Table a three-time American Turf Champion who was named Horse of the Year in 1958. He became a successful and influential breeding stallion who was named Leading sire in North America in 1972. He also had an impact in Europe, where his successful progeny included Baldric, Apalachee and Artaius. Targowice's dam Matriarch won three races and also produced Dona Ysidra, the dam of Manila. Racing career =1972: two-year-old season= Targowice began his racing career by winning the Prix Fontenoy over 1600 metres. The colt was then dropped in distance for the Prix Eclipse over 1300 metres at Saint-Cloud Racecourse in October and won by five lengths from the filly Marschala. On 4 November he contested the Prix Thomas Bryon over 1500 metres at the same track and started the 1.7/1 favourite despite conceding weight to all eleven of his opponents. His most serious opponent appeared to be Kalamoun, whilst the other runners included Abu Simnel (runner-up in the Prix Saint-Roman) and the British-trained Pitskelly. After struggling to obtain a clear run, Targowice finished strongly to catch Kalamoun in the closing stages and won by a neck with Pitskelly a length and a half away in third place. =1973: three-year-old season= On his first appearance of 1973 Targowice started 2/5 favourite for the Prix Djebel over 1400 metres at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse on 30 March and won easily by one and a half lengths from Filitosa with four lengths back to El Rastro in third. He was then to England for the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 5 May. He started second favourite in an eighteen-runner field but became agitated in the preliminaries and was reluctant to enter the starting stalls. He never looked likely to win, began to struggle three furlongs out and finished tenth behind the 50/1 outsider Mon Fils. He was dropped in class for the Listed Prix de Pontarme at Chantilly Racecourse in June and won by a length. Later that month he was matched against older horses in the Prix d'Ispahan over 1850 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. He started favourite but was badly hampered in the straight and finished seventh behind the four-year-old filly La Troublerie although he was promoted to the sixth after the disqualification of Bog Road. On 25 August he was dropped back in distance for the Prix Quincey over 1600 metres at Deauville Racecourse and finished fourth behind African Dancer. Assessment In 1972 the independent Timeform organisation made Targowice the top-rated two-year-old colt in Europe. Although they named the British colt The Go-Between their best two-year-old colt on 129, they rated Targowice a pound higher on 130, level with the Crit√©rium de Saint-Cloud winner Simbir and three pounds behind the filly Jacinth. In the official French Free Handicap he was rated the best two-year-old of 1972, one pound ahead of Simbir and the Grand Crit√©rium winner Satingo. In the following year he was rated 115 by Timeform, twenty-one pounds behind their top-rated three-year-old colt Thatch. Stud record Targowice was retired from racing and began his stud career at a fee of ¬£2000 at the Simmonstown Stud in Ireland. He later stood as a breeding stallion in France before being exported to Japan in 1980. After being exported his offspring began to make an impact in Europe: Prince Mab won the Prix de Cabourg in 1980, Ukraine Girl won the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches in 1981, and Tipperary Fixer won the Prix Kergorlay in 1981. By far the best of his offspring however was the outstanding racemare All Along whose wins included the Prix Vermeille, Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, Turf Classic, Rothmans International and Washington, D.C. International. In Japan he sired 255 winners including Let's Go Tarquin who won the autumn edition of the Tenno Sho as a five-year-old. Targowice covered his last mares in 1992.

History A male eremitic monastery was founded at the site in the 7th century, that was subsidiary to the Abbey of Farfa. In the 15th century, it passed to a Benedictine order of nuns, and the site likely housed a small Romanesque-style church for use by the cloistered nuns. The present church was refurbished in 1764. The layout includes a single nave with semicircular apse. In 1810, the monastery was suppressed, only to be re-opened in 1822. But in 1861, all the property was expropriated and much was sold; in 1880, the nuns were expelled. They moved into local private houses, and maintained as possible a cloistered life. Only in the 1990s, did the convent re-establish expansion.Santa Maria delle Rose, official site. The interior of the church is highly decorated in Baroque fashion. The main altar has a frame flanked by columns with gilded capitals.

Badia Nuova is a Catholic church located in Alcamo, in the province of Trapani, Sicily, southern Italy. Adjoining the church there is the convent of Saint Francis of Paola.  History  The church was founded in 1531 by Father Filippo Scamacca, while the convent of Saint Francis of Paola was built some decades later. In 1699 it was pulled down and enlarged with the construction of a new building and some gardens in the first half of the 18th century (1724), under the direction of Giovanni Biagio Amico, an architect from Trapani. Finally in 1968 it was restored because of the Belice Valley earthquake. The convent was suppressed in 1866, opened again and entirely restored in the subsequent decades.  Description  The church plan is with one nave and a barrel vault with simple pillars, four side altars, and is embellished by a sober stucco decoration. = The convent of saint Francis of Paola = In 1567 Sister Margherita Montesa, together with four sisters, moved here from the convent of Santissimo Salvatore and became the first abbess. Owing to the 1866 Laws, the nunnery had to leave the western wing of the building to a Technica School, later to a lower Vocational School and then to an elementary school;Cataldo, Carlo (2001). La conchiglia di S.Giacomo p.226. Alcamo: Campo. today these premises are used by some associations. The nuns, faithful to the charisma \\"ora et labora\\", live by praying and working; during the day they devote themselves to look after the kitchen garden and other works in the ‚Äùconvent workshops‚Äù such as: * sewing * knitting * embroideries * holy objects repairing * preparation of the famous sweets candied with pumpkin and figs on holidays * small wreaths with petals enamelled with starch. * wine from their own vineyards. Many years ago the nuns attended Mass behind their high grids, today every morning they are inside the church to hear Mass. Besides they are daily engaged with the Liturgy of the Hours and Lectio Divina, which believers can take part in on request. = Works = Inside the Church there are some 18th century paintings and statues: *Saint Benedict from Norcia (on the first left altar): a wonderful canvas by Pietro Novelli with the Holy Trinity on the top, some Angels below it, and Saint Benedict in the middle while giving the rules of the Benedictine Order. Saint Placido is the gentleman on the left with a cane, next to him the Knights of Alcantara, and the Benedictine nuns on the right; below, on the left border, there is a self- portrait of Pietro Novelli (kneeling and with a large mantle) with a beard and a moustache. * the wooden Crucifix (second left altar): assigned to fra Benedetto Valenza from Trapani (1700), at his feet there are two statues made by Giacomo Serpotta: Mary Magdalen and Our Lady of Sorrows * Saint San Francis of Paola, a painting made by Andrea Carrera in 1652 (first right altar). * Our Lady with Angels (Madonna degli Angeli) painted by Giuseppe Sirena (1500), second right altar. * Saint Gregory the Great, above the left portal * Cunigunde of Luxembourg, above the right portal File:Dipinto nella Badia Nuova di Alcamo.jpg|Saint Benedict giving the Rule.

They are among the artist's most important masterpieces, and are very close to Bernini's work for their expressive energy. Six statues are located along the walls, on half-height protruding brackets, while two of them, Our lady of Sorrows and Mary Magdalen, adorn the chapel of the Crucifix and are placed on the two sides of the Cross, forming a type of theatrical scene of extraordinary drama. This is one of the characteristics of Serpotta, also visible in many other masterpieces made by him. The statues are the following: * Peace: represented by a man with a draped suit, leaning on a cane with his right hand, while keeping an olive branch, symbol of peace, with his left hand. * Fortitude: depicted by a woman with an armor, helmet, spear and a shield kept with the left hand; a very fine statue. * Meekness: with a full dress and a diadem on her head, keeping a lamb, symbol of innocence, with her right hand. * Purity is represented by a noble woman, with a richly draped dress, with a beautiful dove (symbol of purity) on her right hand. * Saint Peter is depicted with the Holy Bible and the keyes in his left hand; the right one points out to heaven. * Saint Paul, instead, is represented in the traditional way with a sword in the right hand and the Holy Bible in the left one. For Saint Paul the Word of God is alive, effective and sharper than any other edged weapon. * Mary Magdalen (in the chapel of the Crucifix, second left altar): in a large mantle, her right hand raised towards the right eye wiping her tears. * Our Lady of Sorrows: in a large mantle too, tightening a strip of it with her right hand. The left hand is close to her chest, her head slightly bent down, her eyes in tears and the mouth sobbing.

Foundation The Amazon Region Protected Areas Program (ARPA) originated in a 1998 promise by the Brazilian government to triple the area of the Amazon that was legally protected. The program was launched in 2003, supported by government agencies, NGOs and major donors. The program is based on a major two-year planning exercise with experts from different disciplines, representatives of the indigenous people and others. This defined a set of priority areas for new parks and reserves throughout the Amazon. Objectives Initial objectives were: * Establish about of new strictly protected conservation units of Brazil * Upgrade about of neglected existing parks to effective standards of management * Establish about of sustainable use reserves supported by local communities, and provide effective stewardship * Establish a US$220 million long-term Protected Areas Trust Fund to ensure perpetual financial viability and integrity of the system Benefits include protecting habitats, ecosystems and biodiversity, reducing conflicts over land ownership, providing sustainable use options to local communities, creating barriers against deforestation and burning, maintaining forest coverage to lock up carbon and avoid changes to rainfall patterns. Organization The program is led by the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA), which coordinates the process of identifying protected areas, creating them by law, preparing management plans and establishing staff and infrastructure. IBAMA works with local government authorities and community members. Implementation is overseen by a steering committee that includes representatives from government agencies and civil society. The Brazilian government covers core staffing costs. The World Bank oversees additional funding, which is managed by the Brazilian Biodiversity Fund (FUNBIO). Funding is provided by the Global Environment Facility through the World Bank, the government of Germany through the KfW German Development Bank, the World Wide Fund for Nature through WWF-Brazil and the Amazon Fund through the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES). Conservation units are eligible for disbursements from the fund only when they can show that they comply with rigorous standards. Operations The first phase, which cost US$81.50 million, financed creation and consolidation of of new protected areas, established the endowment fund, established a system for monitoring biodiversity and supported overall coordination by the Ministry of Environment, IBAMA and the Brazilian Biodiversity Fund. ARPA Phase 2 was to expand the protected areas system, with about of new coverage, and to ensure that the program has solid and sustainable finances. It was approved by the World Bank board on 23 February 2012. ARPA resulted in a 68% increase in protected areas and indigenous territories from 2004‚Äì12. In February 2016 it was announced that the federal Ministry of the Environment would include the Serra dos Reis State Park, Samuel Ecological Station and Rio Paca√°s Novos Extractive Reserve, all in Rond√¥nia, among the conservation areas supported under ARPA. Rond√¥nia conservation units already covered by ARPA were the Corumbiara State Park, Guajar√°-Mirim State Park, Rio Preto Jacund√° Extractive Reserve, Rio Caut√°rio Extractive Reserve and Serra dos Tr√™s Irm√£os Ecological Station. The Umirizal Ecological Station would be created. With this expansion the total area covered by ARPA in Brazil rose to .

Built about 1830, it is a well-preserved example of Greek Revival architecture in a rural context. It is most prominent as one of the only known sites in Vermont of the artwork drawn by Rufus Porter, who worked as an itinerant muralist around the time of the house's construction. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Description and history The Elwin Chase House stands a short way south of the village of East Topsham, on the east side of the Topsham-Corinth Road. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a front-facing gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. The main facade, facing toward the street, is three bays wide, with the entrance in the leftmost bay. It is flanked by sidelight windows and pilasters, and is topped by a transom window and entablature. A Federal style fan adorns the gable above, and a narrow strip of bargeboard is set in the eaves. The sides have four window bays, and an ell and barn extend to the rear. The interior has relatively plain woodwork, the newel post of the main stair being a Victorian-era replacement of the original. The stairwell is adorned with a series of murals on virtually all of its surfaces. These are stylistically attributed to the itinerant muralist Rufus Porter, and include what appears to be a fragmentary signature. with The house's exact construction date is unknown, but is placed around 1830 based on architectural stylistic evidence. The murals, which were at the time of the property's listing on the National Register the only known example of Porter's work in the state, are dated to the early 1830s, based on the presence of the frigate USS Potomac, which had in that period made news for its circumnavigation of the globe.

In addition to the attractive nature of the Deltapark Neeltje Jans, it also plays an educational role with respect to the Delta Works. History Deltapark Neeltje Jans was created out of a public information center which, at the initiative of Rijkswaterstaat, was set up in 1986 during the construction of the Oosterschelde barrier in 1979 . During this period the center has been visited by hundreds of thousands from the Netherlands and abroad . During the construction of the Oosterschelde barrier the center was continuously expanded with information about the current state of the construction of the Oosterschelde barrier . =Delta- Expo= Main entrance building, Deltapark Neeltje Jans With the opening of the Oosterschelde barrier, by Queen Beatrix on October 4, 1986, the information center will be permanent and continues under the name \\"Delta Expo\\" in the control building of the Oosterschelde barrier. Besides the technically interested, the center was increasingly frequented by local residents and day trippers. This trend also led to the decision to offer a more attractive character in addition to an educational value. =Waterland Neeltje Jans= The Delta Expo, which was run until 1997 by a foundation, became independent. The name was changed to Waterland Neeltje Jans. Various attractions on the theme of Delta Works, marine animals and water activities were added to the offerings. =Deltaplaza= On August 19, 2002 a raging fire destroyed the reception building at the Delta Pavilion. The park remained open with the use of temporary buildings and construction started immediately on a new multifunctional building to be called the \\"Delta Plaza\\". By the building is already partly in use. Various exhibits that were housed in the Delta Expo, along with a coffee corner and offices, were housed in the Delta Plaza by the end of 2003. From 2003‚Äì2005, the inner area of Neeltle Jans was transformed into a bay where all the activities of Water Land Neeltje Jans were concentrated. =Deltapark Neeltje Jans= In 2007, the name of the theme park was changed to Deltapark Neeltje Jans. Whereas the name WaterLand Neeltje Jans was associated by the public to the attractions especially, Deltapark Neeltje Jans would convey a more neutral character, with equally good emphasis on the intrinsic aspects. In August 2008 the park was acquired by the Spanish company Aspro. Attractions Seal and sea lion show *Seals and Sea-lions. Since 2000, there are 4 harbor seals in the park.

On the embankment flows water pumped from the sea, in a gutter. Along the route of the gutter, waterfalls and streams are placed so visitors can change the flow and the course of water. Other components are an Archimedes screw, a water wheel, a water organ and a water tunnel caves. The eye-catching landmark of the Water Playground is an eight-meter high windmill. *Water Pavilion/ Whale World Expo. This attraction is in the shape of a whale. Visitors start by entering the silver tail section of the building. This part is designed by NOX architects from Rotterdam. There are no windows and the floors are not level. Walking through these corridors is different from normal museum exhibits as each stage provides different experiences such as liquid water spray from a geyser, things to make a person jump and large deluges of rain, in addition to educational pieces about whales and whaling in the black part of the building designed by Kas Oosterhuis. *Boat trip. Since May 2005, Deltapark Neeltje Jans has been the owner of the Breejen Boat Company. During the season the 'Christiaan B' offers boat trips on the National Park Oosterschelde.

He was part of the Glasgow Thistles squad in season 1999-2000. The Thistles were used as an academy side by Glasgow Warriors and sent to New Zealand for rugby training. Calder is now at Dalziel. Professional career In season 2005-06, Calder joined Glasgow Warriors on a trial. A knee injury in the first game of the season to Sam Pinder against Ayr RFC meant that Calder was called upon almost immediately. Coach Hugh Campbell said \\"He fitted in very well considering he had met up with the team only tonight.\\" Although Glasgow Warriors won the match 40 - 10 and his performance was praised, it was Calder's only appearance for the Warriors. Festival Director Calder now runs the annual Festival of Youth Rugby in Dalziel. The festival showcases youth rugby in Scotland, although youth teams from Northern Ireland and England also take part as guest touring teams. The tournament annually attracts around a thousand boys and girls. The festival was started in 1991 by Graham Calder's father Alan Calder. The Alan Calder trophy is handed out to the Under 18 winners. Alan Calder died in 2008 but is still remembered as a Dalziel RFC legend, having previously been club captain and president. The festival celebrated its silver anniversary in 2015. Since 2016 the Festival of Youth Rugby plays its matches on all-weather parks. Calder stated: \\"Over the years we‚Äôve seen the playing fields and facilities here at Dalziel evolve to become among the very best in Scotland. It‚Äôs fitting the 26th festival action will be played on the brand new all-weather parks, marking that progress. Where the landscape has changed, one thing that‚Äôs always remained a constant here is the spirit of rugby. The festival brings all hands to the pump, and the teamwork and the sense of fun and camaraderie has been the very lifeblood of the event since 1991.\\" Former Dalziel and Glasgow Warriors players like Gary Strain and Brian Robertson support the event.

Biography Little is known of Soeur de La Chapelle's life apart from the fact she authored a tragedy, The Illustrious Philosopher, or the Story of Saint Catherine of Alexandria (L'Illustre philosophe, ou l'histoire de Sainte-Catherine d'Alexandrie) about the saint's martyrdom. It was published in 1663 in Autun, France, and the dedication page was signed \\"De La Chapelle Rel. C.\\", with the abbreviation signifying that the author was a cloistered nun. This suggests that she belonged to one of the three communities of nuns then established in the region of Autun. A report by the vicar general of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Autun following a 1676 visit further suggests that her name was Anne de la Capelle-Biron and that she was a member of the Benedictine abbey of Saint-Jean-le-Grand in the Autun diocese. The play itself centers on the story of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, who according to tradition was martyred at the age of 18 or so during the reign of the later Roman emperor Maxentius (c. 278‚Äì312) after she rebuked the emperor for his persecution of Christians. The story goes that the emperor summoned 50 scholars to turn her away from Christianity through a debate, an attempt that failed when Catherine‚Äîherself a noted scholar‚Äînot only won the debate but converted several of her opponents to Christianity. In Soeur de La Chapelle's play, the number of Catherine's opponents is reduced to a single figure, Lucius, for dramatic convenience, placing it in the long tradition of the Socratic dialogue. The play is infused with cartesian thought, evident in the way its author positions the 'miraculous' conversion of Lucius as actually not miraculous at all but rather a product of rational argument. It appears that Soeur de La Chapelle may be the only French nun during the 17th century to have published a play. She used the respected genre of religious tragedy as a vehicle to put Saint Catherine forward as a champion of intellectual equality between men and women and to advocate for the better education of girls. Her use of a sacred subject to achieve a public voice at a time when there were very few women writers has parallels with the careers of the 17th century playwright Marthe Cosnard and poet Fran√ßoise Pascal.

Biography  She was born in PuneShyamala A. Narayan, \\"Sibal, Nina\\" in Encyclopedia of Post-Colonial Literatures in English, eds Eugene Benson, L. W.

After an MA in English at Delhi University (in Miranda House) she lectured there for three years. She also qualified in law and studied French. In 1972 Sibal joined the Indian Foreign Service and started work at the United Nations in New York City. Later she told a journalist that this threw her into \\"the deepest culture shock\\". Other postings included Cairo and three years as deputy director-general of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. In 1992 she became India's permanent delegate to UNESCO in Paris, and went to New York in 1995 to be director of its liaison office there. She was married to the lawyer and politician Kapil Sibal with whom she had two sons. While both spouses pursued demanding careers they maintained a \\"transcontinental\\" marriage according to politician, diplomat and writer Shashi Tharoor.Shashi Tharoor, The Elephant, the Tiger, and the Cell Phone: Reflections on India,, the Emerging 21st-century Power, Penguin, 2007, p. 254. She died from breast cancer in New York in June 2000.\\"Nina Sibal dead\\", The Hindu, 1 July 2000. A Nina Sibal Memorial Award was endowed by her husband. The All India Women's Education Fund Association gives the award annually to an individual who plays a leading role in an organisation using innovative methods to help disabled and disadvantaged children.Nina Sibal Memorial Award, All India Women's Education Fund.  Writing  Sibal's fiction was noticed in 1985 when her short story What a blaze of glory won an Asiaweek short story competition. It was later included in an anthology called Prize Winning Asian Fiction published in 1991.Leon Comber (ed.), Prize Winning Asian Fiction, Times Books, 1991. Yatra, a novel published in 1987, covers more than a century in the life of a Sikh family. Their movements over time reflect the title: \\"Yatra\\" means journey or pilgrimage. Critics comment on the book's magical realism, especially with respect to one character's changing skin colour, and make comparisons with Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children. The author uses mythical elements in her story.Chandra Nisha Singh, Radical Feminism and Women's Writing: Only So Far and No Further, Atlantic, 2007, Themes include the Chipko movement, the history of the Punjab, the origin of Bangla Desh, and the heroine's search for a father.Ray and Kundu, Studies in Women Writers in English, Volume 3, Atlantic, 2005, p. 224. The novel can be criticised for being too crowded with multiple themes, but overall it was generally well received. It won the 1987 International Grand Prix for Literature in Algiers. The Secret Life of Gujjar Mal, Sibal's collection of short stories, was published in 1991. The stories are set in a variety of different countries, some of them disguised with fictional names: Mulgary echoes Bulgaria during the cold war, for example. These settings are not used simply as political or colourful backgrounds but are intertwined with the lives and emotions of the characters. As well as the title story the collection contains six other stories: By his death, Swimming, The face of Dadarao, Fur boots, Sanctuary and The man who seeks enlightenment.Stanford University Library. Her 1998 novel, The Dogs of Justice, is set in Kashmir and tells the story of a rich Muslim girl. It was less well-received than Sibal's previous two books, with one critic saying it did not live up to the promise of the earlier works.

It has three species, all of which are found in Africa. Taxonomy and etymology The type species of Augacephalus is A. breyeri which was described as Pterinochilus breyeri by Hewitt in 1919. In 2002, Gallon placed it a new genus, which he erected in the same paper, Augacephalus.Gallon, R. C. (2002). Revision of the African genera Pterinochilus and Eucratoscelus (Araneae, Theraphosidae, Harpactirinae) with description of two new genera. Bulletin of the British Arachnological Society 12: 201-232 Its name comes from the Greek Œ±œÖŒ≥ŒÆ auga meaning \\"sun rays\\" and Œ∫ŒµœÜ·æ∞ŒªŒÆ kephale meaning \\"head\\" which refers to the prominent, radial cephalothorax striae present in most species. Natural history All known species are fossorial and females lay eggs in a hammock egg-sack which yield about 95 spiderlings.Gallon, R. C. (2010). On some southern African Harpactirinae, with notes on the eumenophorines Pelinobius muticus Karsch, 1885 and Monocentropella Strand, 1907 (Araneae, Theraphosidae). Bulletin of the British Arachnological Society 15: 29-48 Diagnosis Augacephalus is separated from other harpactirines in the following ways: Distinguished from Harpactirella by the presence of a retrolateral cheliceral scopula composed of plumose setae (in males scopula not obviously composed of plumose setae). Separated from Harpactira and Trichognatha by the absence of a dense scopula on the upper prolateral cheliceral surface. Further separated from Harpactira by the absence of plumose stridulatory strikers on the prolateral maxillary surface, and by the absence of a discrete row of bristles below the retrolateral cheliceral scopula. Distinguished from Idiothele by the possession of digitiform distal segment on posterior spinnerets. Differs from Ceratogyrus by the lack of a foveal tubercle/procurved fovea. Female Augacephalus are separated from those of Eucratoscelus by the unmodified (not incrassate) tibiae of leg IV. Male Augacephalus are separated from those of Eucratoscelus and Pterinochilus by lacking the distal proventral tibial apophysis or by the reduced surmounted megaspine.

Claude was a landscape painter in Rome, who began keeping this record in 1635/6, as he began to be highly successful, and maintained it until his death in 1682. The book is now in the British Museum, and was owned by the Dukes of Devonshire from the 1720s until 1957. It was reproduced in print form from 1774 to 1777 by Richard Earlom and had a considerable influence on British landscape art.Wilcox; Kitson, 9‚Äì10 The title Liber Veritatis was apparently invented for these reproductions, but is now also used for the original.Lambert, 142 The drawings, like most by Claude, combine pen and wash (watercolour), the latter brown or grey, and often both. There are often highlights added in white bodycolour, and less often touches in other colours, such as gold and blue.Kitson, 54‚Äì55; Perrin, 78; the British Museum online pages give full details for each page. The original book was a sketchbook made up of alternating groups of white and blue pages, in fours, with an average page size of . Claude began with a self-portrait, then gave each painting a page, usually noting a few details on the reverse of the drawing: a reference number, a signature, the name of the patron and where he was from (if not local), and often a note of the subject. After some years he began to add dates. There are 195 paintings covered in this way. The book has since been added to and rebound, which is covered below.Kitson, 53 There are two handwritten indices, at least the first of which is now regarded as written by Claude himself.British Museum collection database; this conflicts somewhat with another BM page; Kitson, 53 thought they were \\"compiled after Claude's death\\". Such a record of an artist's work is exceptionally rare from this or earlier periods, and has greatly helped scholars; drawings are noted in the literature on the paintings as e.g. \\"LV 123\\". Claude told his biographer Filippo Baldinucci, to whom he showed it at the end of his life, that he kept the record as a defence against other painters passing their work off as his, as had already begun to happen when he started it.Kitson, 54; Sonnabend and Whiteley, 14 The drawings became increasingly elaborate as the years went by, until \\"the book became his most precious possession and virtually an end in itself as a work of art\\".Kitson, 54 (quoted); Perrin, 78 Painting to drawing Landscape with Aeneas at Delos, National Gallery, 1672 The drawings of the Liber Veritatis are records of completed works, the reverse of the preparatory sketches and modelli often made by Claude and other artists before or during the work of painting. Such drawings for recording purposes are usually hard to distinguish from preparatory drawings, and Claude's systematic approach is exceptional. Claude's last painting, Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia (1682, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford) is not quite finished, and does not appear in the book; it is assumed it was still on the easel at his death, and so the drawing for the book not yet done.Kitson, 31 The pages of the sketchbook were filled by the drawings, using a \\"portrait\\" or \\"landscape\\" format as appropriate. The compositions were therefore often slightly squeezed or stretched to allow for the different aspect ratio of the sketchbook compared to the painting.Kitson, 53‚Äì54 In general the composition is very faithfully copied, increasingly so as the series continues. However, details of foliage in particular are sometimes freely adapted. The Landscape with Hagar and the Angel in the National Gallery, London (NG 61, dated 1646) is apparently recorded by LV 106, but while the painting is in a vertical \\"portrait\\" format, the drawing is in a horizontal \\"landscape\\" format. In the drawing some details are altered, and the mountain in the centre, and the vegetation at either side are extended.Wine, 110‚Äì113; for another comparison, see Perrin, 78 Not every painting now accepted as by Claude is shown. Begun in 1635, for the first two years Claude's updating of the book seems to have been erratic.Perrin, 78 Smaller works, and second versions of a subject, which Claude often produced, are often omitted.Kitson, 53 The series was apparently begun on loose sheets, but before long Claude had these and many blank sheets bound as a book.Sonnabend and Whiteley, 14 The end of the original book was apparently reached with LV 185 on 25 March 1675, as Claude's note on the reverse records, but other sheets were added.Kitson, 55 History By a specific mention of it in his will,Sonnabend and Whiteley, 14 Claude left the book to his adopted daughter Agnese, who is usually thought to have been his actual daughter by a servant. She seems to have died by 1716, and it passed to Claude's nephew Joseph. It was in Paris around 1717, when a second index in French seems to have been added, recording the current owners of the painting. It may have been rebound by this stage. The book was bought by William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire in the early 1720s. It was probably kept at Devonshire House in London, where it was seen by Gustav Friedrich Waagen in 1835.Kitson, 53‚Äì54; British Museum page on the frontispiece However, it was not easily available to artists, and the print version was a revelation to the booming English landscape art scene.Wilcox This long period of limited access and little handling has kept the drawings in \\"exceptionally fine\\" condition, despite the paper being thin.Perrin, 78 (quoted); Kitson, 54 One of the index pages, giving the owners of the paintings By the end of the 18th century the book had been disassembled and the sheets mounted individually and placed in a new binding. The mounts, of sugar paper, were cut away to allow the reverses of the sheets to be seen. Five extra Claude drawings were added, to make a complement of 200.Kitson, 53 By 1850 the book had moved to Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, the Devonshire country seat. In 1957 it was ceded to the nation as part of the inheritance tax settlement after the death of the 9th Duke, and placed in the British Museum.Kitson, 54; Perrin, 78; the British Museum says it related to the death of the 9th Duke in 1938. The 10th Duke died in 1950. It was represented by photographs of some pages in the first major exhibition of Claude in 1969 (in Newcastle-upon-Tyne and London) \\"partly on grounds of security and cost\\" and because only one page could have been displayed.Kitson, 53‚Äì54 In the 1970s it was disassembled and the pages mounted individually; pages have subsequently been lent to various exhibitions.Perrin, 78 Reproductions Earlom print of LV 154, 1776 Richard Earlom, a leading English printmaker, was commissioned by John Boydell to copy all 200 drawings as prints, which were published from 1774 to 1777, when a collected edition in two volumes was published as Liber Veritatis. Or, A Collection of Two Hundred Prints, After the Original Designs of Claude le Lorrain, in the Collection of His Grace the Duke of Devonshire, Executed by Richard Earlom, in the Manner and Taste of the Drawings.... with the inscription on the reverses, a \\"descriptive catalogue of each print\\" and the current owner, where it was known. A further volume of 100 prints after other Claude drawings from various British collections was added in 1819, also using \\"Liber Veritas\\" as its title.Wilcox; British Museum page on the prints The prints used etching for Claude's pen lines, and mezzotint for the ink washes, giving a good impression of the originals.Wilcox; British Museum page on the prints All used brown ink on white paper, so disregarding the blue of half the original pages. The prints were a huge success, reprinted and the plates reworked to give increasingly detailed reproductions. They were recommended by drawing teachers as models for copying, and influenced the technique of English watercolour artists in particular, for example Francis Towne.Wilcox; Later edition, on sale for $19,500 in 2016 Another full set of print reproductions after the Liber Veritatis, by Ludovico Caracciolo, was published in Rome in 1815.Kitson, 54 Caracciolo was an Italian landscapist, who became a protege of Elizabeth Foster, the second duchess of the 5th Duke, who moved to Rome after she was widowed in 1811.PDF of Cryan, Mary Jane, Disegni \\"pellegrini\\": i paesaggi della Tuscia di Ludovico Caracciolo All the pages were reproduced in a book on the Liber Veritatis by Michael Kitson, and all are now available online on the British Museum website. The Liber Veritatis inspired J.M.W. Turner to assemble his Liber Studiorum (, a collection of 71 prints after his paintings and watercolours printed from 1807 to 1819.Smiles, Sam, The Turner Book, p. 55, 2006, Tate Publishing, Some later artists adopted the name Liber Veritatis for their own similar drawn records of their work, including Andreas Schelfhout (1787‚Äì1870), a Dutch landscapist, and the Swiss painter Eug√®ne Burnand (1850‚Äì1921).

The bomber's flight is said to have yielded one of the most famous photographs of World War II, and has been linked with the phrase \\"Comin' in on a Wing and a Prayer.\\" It inspired the 414th Bombardment Squadron's emblem, an image of a puppy praying atop an aircraft's tail section. The aircraft The All American was a B-17F-5-BO, serial number 41-24406, in the 97th Bomb Group, 414th Bombardment Squadron. The mission On February 1, 1943, bombers of the 414th Bombardment Squadron departed their base near Biskra, Algeria, to attack the German-controlled seaports, Bizerte and Tunis, Tunisia. After dropping their bombloads and returning toward base, the bombers were attacked by German fighters, believed to be Messerschmitt Bf 109s. Two fighters attacked the lead B-17 and the All American which was flying next to it in formation. The bombers' machine gun fire downed the first fighter, but the second pressed its head-on attack against the All American. Apparently struck by machine gun fire, the second fighter could not complete its roll to pull down and away from the All American, the pilot apparently having been killed or disabled. The German pilot was reported as being 16-victory ace Erich Paczia of I/Jagdgeschwader 53. The aircraft returned safely to base despite the extensive damage to its rear fuselage. Emblem of the 414th Bombardment Squadron in World War II The fighter's wing collided with the top rear fuselage of the All American, almost cleaving the bomber's tail section off, leaving a large diagonal gash from the base of the All American's tail and severing the left horizontal stabilizer from the plane. Metal in the airframe near the right tailplane was the only thing keeping the tail section, housing the rear gunner, attached to the aircraft. The fighter broke apart, leaving some pieces in the bomber's fuselage. The bomber squadron maintained formation to protect the All American until they were beyond the range of enemy fighters, with the crew donning parachutes in the expectation of having to bail out. However, the aircraft was piloted to a safe landing at its base, and despite the damage, none of the crew was injured. The All American was repaired and returned to service as a hack with the 352nd Bombardment Squadron (Heavy), 301st Bombardment Group (Heavy), and flew until its March 1945 dismantlement. The All American is reputed to be the source of the phrase, \\"Comin' in on a Wing and a Prayer,\\" and inspired the 414th Bombardment Squadron's emblem. An image of a puppy praying atop the rear fuselage formed the unit badge. The aircraft was the subject of what has been called one of the most famous photographs of World War II. Mythology Several false myths accrued in the lore of the All American, some of which were refuted in a 2012 interview of her bombardier Ralph Burbridge. Burbridge explained that the aircraft returned to her base in North Africa, and could not have made a long trip back to England as widely recounted. The base near Biskra, Algeria, was a more reasonable 300 miles from the bombing target. Burbridge also said that the collision occurred when the bomber group was returning to base after having dropped its bombs on target, so that the aircraft did not complete a bombing run after being damaged as had been incorrectly recounted. Burbridge's account confirms that the ten crew members donned their parachutes, contradicting stories that the crew sacrificed some of their parachutes to hold the plane together or for an in- flight rescue of crew members from the isolated tail section.
