Biography Professor Anthony (Tony) Turner is an Emeritus Professor of Cranfield University in England, where he was previously the Distinguished Professor of Biotechnology (until 2010) and Principal of Cranfield University at Silsoe. He remained Innovations Director for Cranfield Ventures Ltd (until 2014), with responsibility for licensing and spin offs from Cranfield University. He joined Link√∂ping University (Sweden) in 2010, to help re-establish the university in the field of Biosensors and Bioelectronics, but retired the end of 2018 to focus on translational research and technology transfer in the Sk√•ne region of Southern Sweden. In 1996, he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry, which awarded him the Theophilus Redwood Medal in 2011 for his outstanding contribution to analytical science and especially for \\"his pioneering work which has led to the development of home blood glucose monitoring technology\\". He received a higher doctorate from the University of Kent at Canterbury in 2001 for his \\"outstanding contribution to biosensors\\" and was presented with an honorary doctorate for his \\"contribution to higher education\\" by Bedfordshire University in 2008. He was elected as a Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Engineering in the USA, in 2006, for his exceptional contribution to \\"glucose sensors, environmental monitors and synthetic recognition molecules\\" and elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences (IVA) in 2013. In 2016, he was awarded the Ukraine‚Äôs highest academic distinction, the Vernadsky Gold Medal from the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, for his \\"outstanding achievements in the field of bioelectronics\\", and in the same year, the Datta Medal by the Federation of European Biochemical Societies. He helped found the UK‚Äôs first Biotechnology Centre in 1981 at Cranfield University. There he led the Biosensors Group that went on to develop, in collaboration with Oxford University, a biosensor that transformed the lives of people with diabetes. The principle they established, of using a mediator in a disposable electrochemical glucose biosensor, became the technology of choice for this US$15 billion a year industry. He played a major role in consolidating the field of biosensors as an academic discipline by co-founding the Journal of Biosensors (Elsevier) in 1985 (renamed the Journal of Biosensors and Bioelectronics in 1991), publishing the first textbook on biosensors in 1987 and establishing the World Congress on Biosensors in 1990. He remained Editor-In-Chief of Biosensors and Bioelectronics until 2019 and Executive Chair of the World Congress until 2021. His team has been ranked in the top ten in the world for biosensor development by a variety of international commentators. In academic circles, his name is synonymous with the field of Biosensors, but he has also specialised in leveraging IP and driven numerous biosensor start-ups over the past four decades.  Publications  Professor Turner has over 750 publications and patents in the field of biosensors and biomimetic sensors and a G.S. (2020) h-index of 86, with his most popular paper receiving over 2,200 citations.

A Senior member of the Church, Mr. P.A Anthony Pillai, established a Book Depot in the backyard of the church that sold religious articles imported From Europe, including statues, pictures, and rosaries. He also ran a Tamil library that sold Indian medicines. He would feed the poor every Friday during Lent. However, a catastrophe occurred in the early hours of 23 January 1952. A rock burst out from the ground at approximately 6.30 AM. This happened while the parish priest was performing his offerings of the Holy Mass in the Church. This incident shook the entire building and shattered the church. The result was the collapse of the beams and walls. Other buildings in this area, such as the Magistrate's court, post office, central jail, staff workers' quarters, schools, the Italian club, hospital, railway station and several other structures were also destroyed beyond repair. Fortunately, there were no casualties and a new church was constructed in 1953, which was established under the Bangalore Diocese. The statue of Our Lady of Victories, measuring about six feet tall and located on a pedestal about 15 ft from the church floor, was the only statue left untouched by this catastrophic incident. The Statue stands formidably in the newly constructed church just over the main altar. The statue, originally imported from Portugal, is described as possessing a face that is filled with compassion and many who seek help are seen to kneel before the Our Lady Of Victories shrine and pray for blessings and spiritual attainment. Geographical significance The gold mine located in the district existed even prior to the arrival of the British as mentioned by Roman historian Pliny who had once passed through this region in 77 A.D. In 1850, Pliny made mention of the extensive gold and silver mines that spread over an expansive area. An Irish soldier named Lavelle, who was recuperating in Bangalore after fighting the Maori, was in New Zealand when he heard about the native mines of Kolar and decided to investigate. Today, the Bangalore Cantonment - a road that leads to the Survey of India Office - is named after him. There are five main mines in this district, known as the Mysore, Oorgaum, NandiDurg, and Balghat mines. Out of the total population in the mining areas, there are about 10 to 15 thousand Roman Catholics, a few Protestants and a minority section of Buddhists. Most Of the Anglo-Indians and British citizens who settled in this mining area are Catholics. Since there were a number of Catholics in the K.G.F. area, two Churches were built between 1900 and 1912. One Of these churches was Our Lady Of Victories Church; the other being St. Anthony's Church in the Balghat Mining Area. St. Mary's Boys Primary and Middle School are also situated in the Champion Reefs church area.

The Metropolitanate of Gothia was under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarch until 1783, when, subsequent to the Russian conquest of the Crimea, it was transferred to the Russian Orthodox Church. The bishop's chair was left vacant starting in 1786. The Archdiocese of the Goths also claims territorial jurisdiction of G√∂taland, Sweden, based on the history of the christianization of Scandinavia.

Those born with Khala yogas exhibit good and bad traits in their conduct, speech and behaviour; and also experience good fortune and bad fortune, both. Dainya yogas and Khala yogas affect good fortune and prosperity; They harm people. In the event of these yogas occurring the evil bhavas flourish because of the lord of their lords occupying good houses but these inauspicious yogas prove detrimental to the affairs of the auspicious bhava the lords of evil bhavas occupy. Dainya yogas are worse than Khala yogas. By permutation and combination the lord of the 12th mutually exchanging sign with the lords of the 6th and the 8th causes eleven Dainya yogas, the lord of the 8th with the lords of the 6th and the 12th, ten Dainya yogas, and the lord of the 6th with the lords of the 8th and the 12th, nine Dainya yogas.

However, Kalidasa in his Uttara Kalamrita (vide verse IV.22) offers a slightly differing view; he states that mutual exchange of signs between the lords of the 6th, the 8th and the 12th confer good results provided they are not associated with the lords of other bhavas by way of conjunction or aspect, when they cause Viparita Raja yoga.

Gilbert Stuart, engraving by John Keyse Sherwin after John Donaldson Early life He was born in Edinburgh, the only surviving son of George Stuart (1715-1793), professor of the Latin language and Roman antiquities in Edinburgh University. Gilbert was educated at the High School in Edinburgh and then studied Classics and Philosophy at Edinburgh University, followed by a course in jurisprudence there; but he never followed the law as profession. Journalist In 1768 Stuart went to London, hoping for preferment through Lord Mansfield. In 1769 he lodged with Thomas Somerville in the house of Murdoch the bookseller, writing for the newspapers and reviews. He worked for the Monthly Review from 1768 to 1773. By June 1773 Stuart was back with his father at Musselburgh, working to launch the Edinburgh Magazine and Review. The first number came out about the middle of October 1773, and it was discontinued after the publication of the number for August 1776. In the end, an article by Stuart and Alexander Gillies, written over the protests of William Smellie, attacked Lord Monboddo's Origin and Progress of Language over several numbers. The magazine was stopped. Stuart was a critic of the historian William Robertson, who was the leader of the Moderates in the Church of Scotland. In his view, instead of supporting Catholic toleration, Robertson should have been more assertive in defending the interests of the Kirk. In 1778 Stuart was an unsuccessful candidate for the professorship of public law at the University of Edinburgh, and he believed that Robertson was responsible for his failure.Betteridge, R. & McLean, R. (2019), Northern Lights: The Scottish Enlightenment, p. 13 Stuart nursed his resentment of Robertson over this supposed intervention. In 1785 William Robertson, eldest son of the historian, fought a duel with Stuart, which both survived. In 1782 Stuart settled once more in London, and went back to reviewing. The English Review was established by John Murray I in January 1783, and Stuart was one of the principal writers on its staff. During 1785‚Äì6 he edited, with William Thomson (1746‚Äì1817), twelve numbers of The Political Herald and Review. It opened with a criticism of Pitt's administration, which was still not finished in the final number, and dealt out severe addresses to Henry Dundas and several other Pittites. These diatribes may have prompted the suggestion that Stuart was Junius. Death Stuart would spend whole nights drinking in company at the Peacock in Gray's Inn Lane, London. He died at his father's house at Fisherrow in Musselburgh on 13 August 1786. Works To the second English edition of Francis Stoughton Sullivan's Lectures on the Constitution and Laws of England (1776), Stuart added authorities and a discourse on the laws and government of England Stuart initially supplied corrections and amendments to the Gospel History (1765) of the Rev. Robert Wait. His first independent work was the anonymous Historical Dissertation on the Antiquity of the English Constitution (1768) in which he traced English institutions to a German source. The second edition, which came out in January 1770, with a dedication to Lord Mansfield, bore Stuart's name on the title-page, and it was republished in 1778 and 1790. For this work he received from Edinburgh University on 16 November 1769 the degree of doctor of law. While based in London Stuart supervised the manuscripts of Nathaniel Hooke. From them he finished the fourth volume of Hooke's Roman History. which was published in 1771. After this Stuart temporarily abandoned review-writing for the study of philosophy and history. He appended in 1776 to the second edition of Francis Stoughton Sullivan's Lectures on the Constitution and Laws of England the authorities for the statements and a discourse on the government and laws of our country, and dedicated the volume to Lord North; the whole work was reissued at Portland, Maine, in 1805. Stuart's major work, A View of Society in Europe, was published in 1778, and reprinted in 1782, 1783, 1792, and 1813, and a French translation by Antoine-Marie-Henri Boulard, came out in Paris in 1789, in two volumes. Letters from William Blackstone and Alexander Garden were added to the posthumous edition of 1792 by Stuart's father. In this dissertation Stuart followed Montesquieu. As a contributor to medievalism he is considered a pioneer, sharing with Thomas Hinton Burley Oldfield the conception of early Anglo-Saxon society as harbouring democratic habits. In 1779 Stuart brought out, with a dedication to Lord Mount Stuart, Observations on the Public Law and Constitutional History of Scotland; and in 1780 he published his History of the Establishment of the Reformation in Scotland (reissued in 1796 and 1805). It was followed in 1782 by The History of Scotland from the Establishment of the Reformation till the Death of Queen Mary, which had a second edition in 1784, when he added to it his Observations on the Public Law of Scotland. These works were written with a narrative in the \\"balancing style\\" adopted from Samuel Johnson and Edward Gibbon. Stuart trailed his coat for Robertson, whom he openly challenged to reply to his defence of Queen Mary. Robertson retorted with a charge of plagiarism. The anonymous pamphlet Critical Observations Concerning the Scottish Historians Hume, Stuart, and Robertson (1782), sometimes attributed to Stuart himself, was at least by a friend or ally. It was slapped down by William Enfield in the Monthly Review. Stuart did have a public ally in David Erskine, 11th Earl of Buchan, who made a point of praising him in a speech at the founding of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, in 1780. Stuart's Whig views were not unacceptable to Buchan. Another historian on the Whig side, whom Stuart found tolerable, was Sir John Dalrymple of Cousland.Emerson, pp. 39‚Äì40. References *Roger L.

It is located about south of Ilfracombe and north of Jundah in Queensland, Australia. The station was established in 1872 when Alexander Buchanan acquired of land which formed the initial station. Buchanan sought financial assistance from Scottish and New Zealand backers to develop the property and build permanent waterholes. The backers were The New Zealand and Australia Land Company based in Scotland, and the name Wellshot was taken from a major shareholder's estate near Glasgow. In 1876, the property had an estimated size of running westward to the Thomson River and Westlands Station, bordered by Darling Downs to the south and Beaconsfield Station to the north. Neither the river or creeks are perennial and even if they were it would still be too long a distance to the centre of the run to make it useful. The average rainfall is , but at irregular times, so water was a priority. The station manager set to work and constructed many dams and tanks to capture as much rainfall as practicable. 48 reservoirs with a volume of were excavated. Several bores were sunk as far to find water, giving a regular supply of 1.3 million gallons. In 1881 and again in 1884, the area was struck by drought resulting in terrible stock losses. A total of 27 stockmen from Wellshot moved the biggest ever single mob of sheep when a flock of 43,000 were droved through the area in 1886. Industrial trouble arose at Wellshot later in 1886 during shearing when shearers would not accept conditions proposed by the employer and promptly went on strike. News of the strike spread swiftly through surrounding districts and the men marched on Blackall, the centre of Queensland via Portland Downs, Isis Downs and Thornleigh until over 600 men had joined in. As a result, the Shearers' Union was born. In the early 1890s approximately were resumed in accordance with the Land Act, leaving of excellent grazing country. The resumed portions, mostly along the northern and western boundaries, were put up for selection and eagerly acquired. The townsites of Ilfracombe and Longreach were amongst the resumed portions. In 1892, Wellshot was known as the biggest sheep station in the world, not because of the area it occupied but because of the number of sheep it ran: 460,000. So important was the property that Ilfracombe was known as Wellshot until 1890. 40,000 two-year-old wethers were sold off from the property later the same year. An epic drove was performed by the Tibbett brothers in the 1890s when they droved a flock of 30,000 ewes from Wellshot to Roma, a distance of over , in search of grass for the stock. The sheep were all shorn in Roma and lambing started as relieving rains came to Wellshot. The flock was brought back with an additional 3,000 lambs. In 1897, there was a flock of 387,000 merino sheep on the property which had produced 5801 bales of wool. A serious bushfire broke out resulting from lightning strike at the property in 1918. The glare could be seen from Springlea homestead, some distant. James Inglis was the station manager from 1906 to 1925. He had joined the New Zealand and Australian Land company Limited in 1888 and worked at both Wellshot and Eddington Station before returning to Wellshot to manage the property. Inglis's son Eric Ronald (3 June 1898 ‚Äì 16 February 1991) later documented life on the station in a memoir: \\"When we arrived at Wellshot many of the facilities were run down and below standard, and Father had much renovation and rebuilding work done. This was greatly appreciated. There were usually about five or six jackaroos at the station, as well as an overseer, book keeper, blacksmith, engineer, horse boy, a head musterer and about seven musterers, and a married couple. The male half of the married couple would cook and his wife would do all the housekeeping at the station.\\".Forest, P. \\"A [the] Rush For Grass\\" Interview with Eric Inglis about James Inglis of Well Shot Station.

A station hand, Reuben Hunt, died at Wellshot shortly after being bitten a caterpillar during his lunch break in 1935. The caterpillar had fallen into his shirt as he sat under a tree then bitten him, he was swiftly covered in a painful rash and started vomiting. He was taken to the homestead but died en route to the hospital in Longreach. Later that year in June, 50,000 sheep were moved from the property in 400 railway trucks and sent off to Boatman Station. In December of the same year the area was strock by a heatwave with the station recording a maximum temperature of . The lease for Wellshot expired in 1948, so the New Zealand and Australian Land Company had to truck about 30,000 sheep from the property in readiness to allow the station to be cut up for closer settlement. Later the same year the station was hit by a storm and suffered significant damage from cyclonic gales and heavy hail. The manager, Mr MacIntyre, reported the hail tore holes in the iron roofs and was packed to a depth of one foot on the verandah. An unstocked homestead block on the station was sold for ¬£35,000 in 1953. The purchasers were the Gordon brothers of Gordonvale, another Wellshot selection.

Originally titled Turkeys, and scheduled for 2014, the film was released on November 1, 2013, by Relativity Media. The film received largely negative reviews from critics and earned $110 million on a $55 million budget. Plot Reggie is a turkey who has always feared Thanksgiving because turkeys have always been on the menu, but his incessant attempts to warn his flock have made him an outcast. When the other turkeys finally realize what is happening, they thoughtlessly throw Reggie outside in an attempt to save themselves. To his surprise, he is named the \\"pardoned turkey\\" by the President and is subsequently taken to Camp David. Although initially hesitant, Reggie soon eases into a routine of doing nothing but enjoying pizza from the \\"Pizza Dude\\" and watching Mexican telenovelas. Reggie is kidnapped by Jake, a member of the Turkey Freedom Front, who tells him that \\"The Great Turkey\\" told him to find Reggie and take him back to the first Thanksgiving with him to take turkeys off the menu. They steal a time machine controlled by an A.I. named S.T.E.V.E. (Space Time Exploration Vehicle Envoy) from a Government facility. Jake instructs S.T.E.V.E. to time-travel back to the same day in 1621, three days before the first Thanksgiving. Once there, they are ambushed by colonial hunters led by Myles Standish, but they are quickly rescued by native turkeys led by Chief Broadbeak and his two children, Ranger and Jenny. Broadbeak explains that the turkeys in the area have been forced underground since the settlers came and that they cannot risk fighting back without the settlers taking them. The next day, Broadbeak orders Jake and Ranger to spy on the settlers while Reggie and Jenny spring all the humans' hunting traps. Despite initial hostility, Ranger and Jake find out that the settlers have already begun preparations for Thanksgiving and where they keep their weapons. Meanwhile, Jenny is unconvinced Reggie is from the future, but is impressed with his accidental unorthodox way of springing the traps. However, they are soon intercepted by Standish and Reggie is forced to send her into orbit aboard the time machine, validating everything he said. Reggie asks Jenny to go back to the future with him once everything blows over, but she refuses to leave the flock no matter how much she likes him. Jake then drags Reggie away and tells him he has a plan to attack the settlers. However, Reggie has become tired of Jake's improbable stories and threatens to leave. Desperate, Jake tells Reggie that this trip was more about him making up for his failure to save turkey eggs while escaping a factory farm when he was young, maintaining that the Great Turkey convinced him to go through with this. While still reluctant to believe what he said, Reggie still goes along with the plan. They blow up the weapons shack, but Jake inadvertently leaves a gunpowder trail back to the turkeys' hideout. Standish and his men flush the turkeys out from underground, capturing enough for the feast; Broadbeak sacrifices his life to help the remaining turkeys escape. Disgraced, Reggie returns home, where he discovers from S.T.E.V.E. that he is the Great Turkey. He travels back in time to send the young Jake on his mission. Jenny is sworn in as the new chief and orders the remaining turkeys to prepare an attack on the settlers. Jenny, Jake and Ranger lead the turkeys in an attack on the settlement just as Chief Massasoit and his tribe arrive. Inspired, Reggie goes back in time to stop the attack, inadvertently trapping Standish in the time stream. Through S.T.E.V.E. and the Pizza Dude, Reggie convinces the settlers and Indians that pizza is a more acceptable food than turkeys, taking them off the Thanksgiving menu entirely.

John Kricfalusi was involved in early development, and posted the concepts he created for the film on his blog. Reel FX and Granat Entertainment launched in 2010 Bedrock Studios (later renamed to Reel FX Animation Studios) to produce sub-$35 million family-oriented projects. Ash Brannon was then set to direct the film, but in October 2012, when it was announced that Relativity Media would co-finance, co-produce, and distribute the film, Jimmy Hayward took over the directing position. Originally scheduled for November 14, 2014, the film was moved up by a year to November 1, 2013, due to the vacant slot left after the delay of DreamWorks Animation's Mr. Peabody & Sherman. In March 2013, the film was retitled to Free Birds. Release=Critical response= Free Birds was critically panned. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 19% approval rating with an average rating of 4.27/10 based on 89 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \\"Technically proficient yet creatively moribund, Free Birds begs unfortunate comparisons with the dim- witted fowl that inspired it.\\" Another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 38 based on 27 reviews, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Justin Chang of Variety gave the film a negative review, saying \\"This seemingly innocuous toon fantasy becomes another noxious-but- sanitized exercise in family-friendly cultural insensitivity.\\" Alonso Duralde of The Wrap gave the film a negative review, saying \\"Even setting aside the film's disregard for time-travel paradoxes and genocide metaphors‚Äîtrust me, you don't want to wade into either of those‚ÄîFree Birds just isn't funny.\\" Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice gave the film a negative review, saying \\"Like so many modern animated features, Free Birds packs too much in; the picture feels cramped and cluttered, and, despite its occasionally manic action, it moves as slowly as a fattened bird waddling toward its doom.\\" Kate Erbland of Film.com gave the film a 7.6 out of 10, saying \\"Free Birds is a more than worthy (and weird) holiday diversion for the whole family.\\" Stephan Lee of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C, saying \\"Often, you can point to a middling animated film's visuals as its saving grace. But this colonial world, which should feel like an expansive autumnal panorama, feels oddly inert and two-dimensional.\\" Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying \\"The 3-D animated film, the first of the holiday entries, is likable and amusing, if slight.\\" Chris Cabin of Slant Magazine gave the film one out of four stars, saying \\"The film is absent of humor and thrills, and accented with designs and color schemes that are equally notable for their lack of risk.\\" Sheri Linden of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a negative review, saying \\"Like the ungainly avian creatures at the center of the herky-jerky adventure, this 'toon seldom gets off the ground.\\" Jessica Herndon of the Associated Press gave the film two out of four stars, saying \\"A solid premiere effort that shows Reel FX's potential to produce quality full-length animation. But the story-line, with its hypothetical constituents, seems a little desperate at times, even for a kiddie film.\\" Linda Barnard of the Toronto Star gave the film one out of four stars, calling the film \\"A seasonally pegged 3D cartoon bore that sets the bar so low, it could give a slug a concussion.\\" Tom Russo of The Boston Globe gave the film two out of four stars, calling the film \\"A welcome foray into underexploited territory, conceptually at least.\\" Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic gave the film two out of five stars, saying \\"It isn't cute. It isn't really funny. It just kind of is.\\" Louis Black of The Austin Chronicle gave the film one and a half stars out of five, saying \\"Free Birds falls flat, despite its good intentions, ideological cuteness, humorous polish, and skillful computer animation. The fine voice talents of the almost- ideal cast are wasted.\\" Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News gave the film two out of five stars, saying \\"Most minor animated movies are so rote that it‚Äôs worth acknowledging a strange bird like this cheerfully gonzo kid flick. It‚Äôs no masterpiece, but if you‚Äôre hoping for a family film that will keep everyone reasonably entertained, this will fly.\\" Miriam Bale of The New York Times gave the film a negative review, saying \\"The concept is inane, and the execution is manic and unoriginal.\\" Sara Stewart of the New York Post gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying \\"Is Hollywood scheming to turn your little ones into strident vegetarians? Could be, but I wish they‚Äôd do it with material more inspired than Free Birds, a forgettable‚Äîand occasionally borderline offensive‚Äîanimated tale of turkeys trying to take back Thanksgiving.\\" David Hiltbrand of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying \\"Free Birds is a stale turkey hash that heaves a lot of ingredients in the oven but never turns on the gas, a frantic attempt to come up with an animated film built around Thanksgiving Day traditions.\\" Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying \\"The movie's animal rights, vegetarian message should go down easily with politically correct parents‚Äîat least until they choke on the offensive depiction of 17th-century turkeys as face-painted, headband-wearing native Americans.\\" Stephanie Merry of The Washington Post gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying \\"Finally, there's a movie vegetarian parents can enjoy with their impressionable offspring.\\" Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film one out of four stars, saying \\"In execution, the film is all sidekicks and sight gags, with little story cohesion or purpose.\\" Bill Zwecker of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a mixed review, saying \\"No, Free Birds is not (sorry) a turkey of a film. But it doesn‚Äôt really soar terribly high either. I only wish the quality of the writing in the earlier parts of the movie had been maintained throughout. If that had been the case, Reggie, Jake and their fellow turkeys just might have been flying high with the eagles‚Äîour official national birds.\\" Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a mixed review, saying \\"Although it seldom approaches the inspiration of its plucky premise‚Äîa pair of turkeys travel back in a time machine to the first Thanksgiving in a bid to scratch the traditional entree off the menu‚ÄîFree Birds nevertheless manages to avoid being branded a holiday turkey.\\" Christy Lemire of RogerEbert.com gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying \\"Everything about Free Birds feels perfunctory, from its generic title and holiday setting to its starry voice cast and undistinguished use of 3-D.\\" =Box office= Free Birds grossed $55,750,480 in North America, and $54,400,000 in other countries, for a worldwide total of $110,150,480.

Wallace at the Benjamin Franklin Life Sciences Medal Symposium Douglas Cecil Wallace (born November 6, 1946) is a geneticist and evolutionary biologist at the University of Pennsylvania and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania. He pioneered the use of human mitochondrial DNA as a molecular marker. Career Wallace earned a Bachelor of Science in Genetics and Developmental Biology at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York in 1968, a Master of Philosophy in Microbiology and Human Genetics at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut in 1972 and a Ph.D. in Microbiology and Human Genetics at Yale University in 1975. His dissertation was titled Cytoplasmic genetics in mammalian tissue culture cells. He remained at Yale University as a postdoctoral fellow until he was awarded a professorship (Assistant Professor) at the Stanford University School of Medicine in Stanford, California in 1976. In 1983 he became professor (Adjunct Professor) for Biochemistry, Anthropology and Pediatrics (Genetics) at the Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. From 1996 to 2002, he was Chairperson and Senior Editor of the Mitochondrial DNA Locus-Specific Database for the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO). In 2002 he assumed a professorship of Molecular Genetics at the University of California, Irvine and founded the Center for Molecular and Mitochondrial Medicine and Genetics there. In 2006 he was awarded a visiting professorship at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan. In 2010 he became professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and became the founding director of the Center for Mitochondrial and Epigenomic Medicine at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Work Wallace is a pioneer in the study of mitochondrial DNA. Wallace and his colleagues introduced human mitochondrial genetics into the field of molecular genetics. In 1975, for the first time ever, Wallace could associate a genetic disorder with the mitochondrial DNA region (resistance to chloramphenicol) and in 1990 he described a mitochondrial DNA mutation as the cause of a particular form of myoclonic epilepsy. He has been instrumental in the study of the mitochondrial genome and has developed new methods for the analysis of mitochondrial DNA. Wallace and his colleagues demonstrated that human mitochondrial DNA is inherited exclusively from the mother and reconstructed the origin and ancient migration patterns of women using variations in mitochondrial DNA sequences. The term haplogroup was coined in this paper.

Written by Kifayat Rodani, the serial was directed by Syed Ali Raza Usama and co-produced by Shahzad Naseeb and Samina Humayun Saeed.  Story  The story highlights the concept of living conditions of a very poor family in Pakistan and the hardships and difficulties they have to face daily to earn their living. Things are never easy for Khushi commonly known as Pagli and her entire family with their Akbar Ali (Father) selling newspapers but hardly earning anything, Zuleikha (her mother) working as a maid in a rich house but always getting insulted by the owner, while she and Bano (her sister) wash car mirrors on the roads. Ummo (her brother) works in a workshop. They are in such a miserable condition that they have nothing to eat most of the times. The parents are worried about Khushi's marriage but have to hold back because they cannot afford dowry. The story takes an amazing turn and finally a proposal comes for Khushi but it's not just a marriage proposal; it's a one-year contract with selfish intentions behind it. The most shocking thing for Khushi would be when she actually gets to know later about Zuleikha's reality. It will show you how the elite rich class manipulates the poor class for their own motives and then discard them off once they are no longer needed. You will also get to see that money is such a powerful force which can force parents to take certain steps which are unethical. See how things turn out to be as this amazing story develops depicting the reality of our and other third world countries.  Cast  * Fatima Effendi as Khushi a.k.a.

He is an alumnus of √âcole Polytechnique and √âcole des Ponts ParisTech (ENPC). Career After studying at √âcole Polytechnique and ENPC (Ponts-et- Chauss√©es), Suard began working at the Compagnie G√©n√©rale d‚Äô√âlectricit√© (CGE) in 1973. He was named CEO of the subsidiary Les C√¢bles de Lyon (Lyon Cable), which moved from fifth place to first in international ranking during the three years of his tenure. In 1986, when CGE was privatized, he was named CEO of the group by prime minister √âdouard Balladur. In 1991, CGE became Alcatel Alsthom, and in 1998 the company‚Äôs name was changed to Alcatel. Suard presided over the development of the first digital telephone exchanges, as well as that of fiber optic cables, which were eventually bought by ITT. He transformed a French company that was known foremost for its close relationship with the government into an international industry with a global strategy. In 1993, Alcatel secured the contract for the high-speed train in Korea, became the world leader in cable and telecommunications, and began to invest in media outlets, controlling two of France‚Äôs most popular news magazines, Le Point and L'Express. Legal Proceedings On July 4, 1994, Jean-Marie d'Huy, investigating magistrate at the civil court in the city of √âvry, indicted Pierre Suard for abuse of public assets after Suard, afraid of becoming a target for terrorists from Action Directe, had a construction subsidiary of the Alcatel group install security systems worth 3 million francs in his homes. On March 10, 1995, after being accused by Denis Gazeau, a former Alcatel executive who was fired for ‚Äúincompetence,‚Äù the judge indicted Suard for concealing fraud and overcharging 674 million francs to France T√©l√©com, his biggest client. Suard was placed under judicial review, under which he was forbidden to continue to work for the group, and he was obliged to leave his job in June. He was succeeded by Serge Tchuruk. Suard accused Tchuruk of having pushed him out of his job and unjustly using certain accounting methods to discredit his management of the company, and to show artificially improved results after Suard left. In any case, the judgment that forbade Suard to work for the group made the company immediately lose 40% of its value on the French stock exchange. The judgment therefore inflicted a loss on stockholders thousands of times larger than the 9 million francs he purportedly ‚Äústole‚Äù from the company.

It was founded by Gilbert Stuart, who pursued an aggressive editorial line that eventually led to the magazine's demise. History The first number came out about the middle of October 1773, and it was discontinued after the publication of the number for August 1776. Early advantages were negated by Stuart's tendency to pursue private vendettas against lawyers and other historians; William Smellie the printer struggled to contain him. Stuart's slashing article on the Elements of Criticism by Lord Kames, was completely metamorphosed by Smellie. Stuart sometimes had his own way: when David Hume reviewed and praised the second volume of Robert Henry's History of Great Britain, the article was cancelled and one by Stuart substituted for it, which went the other extreme. Behind Smellie was William Creech, who launched a number of periodicals. The climax was reached in an article by Stuart and A. Gillies, written over the protests of Smellie, on Lord Monboddo's Origin and Progress of Language. It was scurrilous and abusive, ran through several numbers of the fifth volume, and caused the magazine to be stopped. Contributors The major writers, in addition to Stuart, were William Richardson of Glasgow, William Baron, Thomas Blacklock, Rev. Alexander Gillies, and Smellie.

Her work, both small scale and monumental, has gained an international following, with permanent installations in Europe, Asia, North America, South America, Africa, the United Arab Emirates and the Caribbean. Ramersdorfer works in marble and granite, often in combination with steel, using light and space to create physical and spiritual interiors.Keren, Jacqueline. Review, Confluence of Opposites at the Lake Placid Center for the Arts, Sculpture Magazine, June 2008.  Education  Ramersdorfer studied philosophy in Paris in 1979 before enrolling in the International University of Art in Florence, Italy, where she studied African art history, museum science, and Renaissance fresco restoration. At the same time, she studied etching for two years at the graphic art studio of the Santa Reparata International School of Art in Florence. She entered the sculpture department at the Academy of Fine Arts in Carrara, Italy, in 1983, receiving her MFA in 1988.Ainslie, Patricia, Architecture of the Soul: Emblem for Belize, Pacific Sculpture, April 6, 2012, pp. 14-16  Career  After completing her studies, Ramersdorfer‚Äôs career took off, thanks in part to grants from the Austrian Ministry of Education and the Arts and Culture and the Federal Chancellery in Vienna to work abroad, most notably in Japan in the early 1990s where she studied the culture and developed and exhibited new work. It was there that she \\"absorbed the notion of balance, both mental and structural. There she also learned to be true to her materials, and that all matter has an animus that animates it.\\" A grant from UNESCO supported the Carambolage Project, a 1998 exchange with artists of the Caribbean. In 1995 she returned to Austria where she established studios in Vienna, and in Vorarlberg, in the home/office designed by her father, the architect Mag. Willi F. Ramersdorfer (1922-2010).http://www.springerarchitektur.at/willi-f-ramersdorfer-1922-2010/ Over the next few years, she worked in both Asia and Europe on the Energy series, developing the Ring Project in Fukuoka, Japan, and the Inner View series in Vienna. Since then, she has participated in exhibitions worldwide and won commissions to create a number of large-scale, site-specific works at nearly two dozen international sculpture symposia. Her sculptures are installed in private and public art collections in Europe,:de:Datei:Hohenems Skulptur.jpg Japan, Taiwan, Egypt, Canada, U.S.A., China, Belize, Abu Dhabi and Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where she was awarded first prize at the 2005 Emaar International Art Symposium for Inner View. The Inner View series, an exploration of spiritual interiors as expressed through sculpture, has been the focus of her work for over a decade. Seed of Unified Spirit,http://www.sculpture.org/portfolio/sculpture_info.php?sculpture_id=1007806 a piece from the series, was selected for inclusion in the Olympic Garden for the 2008 summer games. It has been permanently installed there, facing the Linglong Tower. In 2011 Inner View‚ÄìOpen was selected for installation in the Campus Sculpture Park for the Centennial of Tsinghua University, Beijing. In early 2009 Ramersdorfer was one of 17 artists (and the only woman) participating in the Abu Dhabi International Sculpture Symposium. She produced a 15-ton sculpture in white marble, which took five weeks to create.http://www.gulfnews.com/arts-entertainment/visual-performing- arts-2.313/works-of-open-minds-abu-dhabi-international-sculpture- symposium-1.590951 After spending summers in the Adirondack Region of upstate New York, Ramersdorfer became a permanent resident of the US in 2009 and has a studio in Wells, New York.  Themes  Ramersdorfer‚Äôs early work consisted of ‚Äúcombinations of rusty steel and granite characterized by a terrestrial, heavy gravitation.‚Äù These were seen as ‚Äúa metaphorical expression of contemporary life and existence...‚ÄùPichler, Karl-Heinz, Review, Archaic utopia in stone, Gallery Ruth Allemann, Vorarlberger Nachrichten, Zurich, Switzerland, 1990 As an emerging artist, Ramersdorfer made several trips to Japan at the invitation of the Reimei no oka International Sculpture Symposium in Kyushu, and the International Sculpture Symposium, Mura-oka-Cho/Hyogo Ken, and with the help of a grant from the Austrian Ministry of Education and the Arts and Culture she was able to stay on. Thus began a period of artistic growth as Ramersdorfer traveled between Asia and Europe. Upon her return to Japan in 1995, her work took on a lighter quality when she began a new series that integrated bamboo columns into stone sculptures. These sculptures were ‚Äúloose, weightless, elegant‚Ä¶ symbolizing steps towards a higher cognition and eternal youth.‚ÄùPichler, Karl-Heinz, Review, The lightness of weight, Gallery Ruth Allemann, Vorarlberger Nachrichten, Zurich, Switzerland, 1994 This trend continued over the next decade, enhanced by the addition of light as a sculptural element in her pieces. In the series Light (1997-1998), Ramersdorfer excavated ‚Äúa defined space from natural rocks. Substituting the material with white neon light, Caroline Ramersdorfer visualizes a filtering of lines contrasting the full and void, the cubic and the structured layerings‚Äîmaking her sculptures seem to float and take off on a journey.‚ÄùMatt, Luise. Exposition review news, Vorarlberger Nachrichten. Zurich, Switzerland, 1997 In 2001, the Austrian Ministry of Art and Education supported a multimedia project, Inner Views, initiating a series of marble sculptures that continues to the present. The concept behind Inner Views, is to set free sculptural detail views from the inside of a form. In the series, \\"she has focused on turning white marble inside out by using light, texture and grinding.\\"Tim Kane, \\"Caroline Ramersdorfer‚Äôs sculptures vibrate with life\\", Times Union, September 21, 2008 In these sculptures, Ramersdorfer analyzes multiple square marble slabs then recomposes them to reveal complex interior spaces populated with carved out columns and ridges. As in her earlier work, light is used as a sculptural element to transform a physical interior into something ethereal. The sculptures range in size from small scale to monumental, site-specific works. Int.Friendship Sculpture Park Urumqi China 2009 Ramersdorfer sees the viewer as an integral part of her sculptures, and they are considered in her design from the beginning, especially in how she integrates light into her pieces. Smaller scale works are assembled in metal stands or hung in such a way as to reflect and capture the light. In her large-scale work, the viewer can enter the piece and experience the play of light, observing how this transforms a sculptural interior into a spiritual one. The effect is described in the essay by Albert Ruetz in the catalogue accompanying the Cairo Biennial XII. ‚ÄúLight and the passage of time turn the delicate lattices into translucent assemblies that are constantly created anew, evoking a most varied range of emotions. In this way, the sensed three- dimensionality of the sculpture is augmented by the additional dimension of discovery, in the material qualities of the marble and its many-layered construction. The crystalline nature of the material is transformed by shifting light into amorphous formations which appear to breathe, acquiring a life and vitality of their own.‚ÄùRuetz, Mag. Albert, catalogue, Cairo XII Art Biennial, 2010-2011 Symbolism is important in Ramersdorfer‚Äôs work, as evident in the Inner Views series.Bruni, Susanna, exposition catalogue ‚ÄúForme nel Verde,‚Äù San Quirico d‚ÄòOrcia, Tuscany 1986, curated by Enrico Crispolti As the series progressed, Ramersdorfer began to see the inner carvings as representing an interior world both physical and spiritual, something she called an architecture of the soul. Cross-cultural understanding is another important theme in her work, through which she tries to bridge cultures to increase tolerance and understanding. \\"I see being a sculptor as an active process in creating a union and finding intersecting points between art, world cultures and their decisive human factor.\\"Minor, Rodney. Sculpture Understanding, Leader-Herald, Gloversville, NY, April 18, 2010. Seed of Unified Spirit, completed in 2008, took a global perspective, with seven marble slabs representing the different continents and poles, reflecting the Olympic park theme of ‚ÄúOne World‚ÄìOne Dream.‚Äù Inner View Interlocked (2009), a commission from the Xinjiang International Urban Sculpture Symposium in Urumqi, China, to commemorate sixty years of the People‚Äòs Republic of China, also embraced the idea of bridging cultures, ethnicities and human experience. Since moving to the Adirondacks, Ramersdorfer has found inspiration in her rural environment. Her work has opened up, breaking through the ‚Äúrigid angularity of her earlier work into more expressive abstractions.‚ÄùKane, Tim. Caroline Ramersdorfer, Adirondack Life, Jay, NY, January/February 2013. Her ‚Äúchanging environment has led her to see the perfection in imperfection; their impermanence has melted away her conformity. With nature more of a guide, the new works provide a refreshing fluidness and unpredictability that is more evocative than the older works that precisely fit together like the specifications of a building, or a math equation.‚ÄùKane, Tim. Cold beauty, Times Union, Albany, NY, September 5, 2010. Indicators, the centerpiece of her first solo exhibition since moving to the Adirondacks, ‚ÄúConcept Alters Reality‚Äù at the John Davis Gallery, exemplified this new direction. ‚ÄúGone are the volumes of marble; what‚Äôs left is a distilled abstraction bursting forth with energy, rather than the cool, calculating forms she has constructed on five continents. Other newer examples, like Inner View-Open 1 and Open Inner View, exhibited at the C. Grimaldis Gallery in Baltimore, shatter their frames as chards of marble‚Äîlike broken glass or melting ice‚Äîstick out like spikes.‚ÄùKane, Tim Kane.

The roots of classical music in Kosovo are found in the 1940s and include the time period from the times when Kosovo was part of Yugoslavia to this day. It can be said that there is a tradition of classical music in Kosovo, however, compared to other Balkan countries and especially European countries this tradition is younger. Classical music in Kosovo reaches back about 70 years. Even though in a short period of time, this music has evolved, passing through generations of composers and artists. In his book , Engj√´ll Berisha comments: History The building of the music school in Prizren Prior to any developments of classical music in Kosovo there were amateur activities preceding them that set the environment for later developments, such as the activities of the wind orchestra \\"Bashkimi\\" in Skopje, the wind orchestra of Gjakova led by Palok Kurti, the boarding school \\"Kosova\\" in Krum√´, the fanfare band \\"Kosova\\" in Kuk√´s and the Albanian Catholic Church in Prizren. The first radio station that opened in Prizren in 1945 is also important to the beginnings of professional music in Kosovo, as for a long time much of the musical life in Kosovo was tied to this institution. =Major foundations= Classical music in Kosovo saw its first developments in the 1940s with the first creations of classical music by Kosovans. This is also the time of establishment of the choir and the chamber orchestra of the cultural and artistic society Agimi in Prizren in 1944 and the opening of the music school in Prizren in 1948, which was the first music school in Kosovo. The first creations of classical music in Kosovo were a cappella choral compositions and were initially stylized rearrangements of folk music. Although some of these choral works were original creations, most of them relied on folk music. After the first music school in Prizren in 1948, another music school in Pristina followed in 1948 The building of the music school in Pristina =First opera and ballet= The first opera by a Kosovan composer is \\"Goca e Ka√ßanikut\\". It was composed in the late 1970s in two acts by Rauf Dhomi, with a libretto in Italian by Jusuf Buxhovi and Ajmane Dhomi, based on a novel by Albanian writer Milton S. Gurra. It was written for six soloists, choir and orchestra. The first Kosovan ballet is \\"Sokoli e Mirusha\\". It was composed in 1976 in two acts by Akil Mark Koci, with a libretto by Nuredin Loxha. =Symphony orchestra and choir of RTP (Radio Television of Pristina)= Both the symphony orchestra and the choir of RTP (Radio Television of Pristina) have been of major importance to cultural life in Kosovo. The Symphony orchestra of RTP worked from the early 1950s to 1990. Its program consisted of classical, romantic and contemporary creations as well as new creations by Kosovan composers. It consisted of native as well as foreign instrumentists. The professional choir of RTP worked from 1980 to 1990. Its members had an education in music and were also experienced after having worked in the early amateur choirs. The choir was very active in recording music and playing in festivals throughout Yugoslavia. =1990 to present= All activity in music institutions in Kosovo was halted in 1990-1991 during the Yugoslavian era. For about 10 years, all schools that had been closed worked in private houses and concerts of classical music took place in Albanian catholic churches. The year 1999 saw the beginning of new activities regarding classical music, mostly coordinated by young artists. The year 2000 saw the foundation of Kosovo Philharmony and the International Festival of Chamber Music. Until 2004 there were 17 Kosovan composers creating classical music while performances remained a problem due to a lack of performing artists. To that time almost all Kosovan composers had been educated in Belgrade, Sarajevo, Ljubljana, Skopje and specialized in Europe, while most performing artists had been educated in Pristina. Major composers and works For a full list, see List of Kosovan composers =Lorenc Antoni= Lorenc Antoni (1909 - 1991) is the first Albanian composer in Kosovo and founder of the first music school in Kosovo. He studied music in Skopje but unfortunately never graduated from any higher musical institution and was a self-taught composer, educating himself by analyzing the works of foreign composers. He was born in Skopje, lived in Prizren for ten years and moved to Pristina in 1956. Living in a place with no musical tradition except for folk music, he used a creative application of the rich Albanian folk music heritage and relied in the best practices towards artistic music that had been used by other Balkan nations. Theme from Rapsodia shqiptare by Lorenc Antoni Most of his works were compositions for a cappella choirs and most of them rely on folk music. Some of the songs that he did reworkings of are: \\"Na ka dal√´ nusja e mir√´\\", \\"Ani moj Hatixhe\\", \\"Ani mori nuse\\" and \\"Kur m√´ del n√´ der√´\\". These are typical old urban songs that are sung at weddings and other social gatherings. An important song that Lorenc Antoni reworked is \\"K√´nga e Rexh√´s\\". This is a folk ballad and one of the most well-known Albanian songs. The song was reworked by Konstantin Trako and used by Rexho Mulliqi in \\"Simfonia e dyt√´ kosovare\\" but Lorenc Antoni was the first to extensively rework this song. =Rexho Mulliqi= Theme from Kosovarja, No. 2 by Rexho Mulliqi Rexho Mulliqi (1923‚Äì1982) was born in Gucia, present-day Montenegro. He went to school in Skoplje (now Skopje) and Pristina and then studied composition at the Academy of Music in Belgrade. His most recognised works are his second symphony Kosovarja and Baresha, for soprano and orchestra, sung by Nexhmije Pagarusha. His compositions are rearrangements of solo works and works for choir and orchestra. =Rafet Rudi= Symphony in two parts by Rafet Rudi Rafet Rudi was born in 1949 in Mitrovica. He went to music school in Pristina and studied composition and conducting at the Academy of Music in Belgrade. He obtained his master's degree in Sarajevo and then went to France for further studies. His most recognized works are Symphony in two parts and Fantasie in Si for violin and piano. He is a composer, conductor, pedagogue, and publicist-essayist who has written educational textbooks, articles, essays and critique on music. He has worked with the professional choir of the Radio Television of Pristina. =Zeqirja Ballata= Zeqirja Ballata was born in ƒêakovica in 1943. He finished studies in Prizren and studied for composition in Ljubljana where he got his master's degree. Then he continued to specialize in composition in Italy. After studies, he worked as a pedagogue in the Faculty of Music in Pristina. In 1991, he moved to Maribor, Slovenia, where he remains. He wrote about musical matters in books such as Veglat muzikore and Gjurm√´ve t√´ muzik√´s. Excerpt from \\"Pascaglia\\" for orchestra by Zeqirja Ballata His most recognized works are \\"Passacaglia\\" for orchestra and \\"Symphony-'83\\". Zeqirja Ballata is one of the first composers in Kosovo to utilize the serial dodecaphonics style of composing. His works are played throughout Slovenia, Kosovo, Albania, Austria, France, Holland and the USA. =Mendi Mengjiqi= Excerpt from the national anthem of Kosovo by Mendi Megjiqi Mendi Mengjiqi was born in Lupq, Kosovo in 1958. He graduated from the Academy of Arts in Pristina in theoretical studies in 1987. He then went on to study composition at the academy of arts in Krak√≥w, Poland where he earned his master's degree in the class of Krzysztof Penderecki. His most recognized work is Homagium Matri Teresiae that premiered in the 600th jubilee of Krak√≥w Conservatory. As of 2006 he has been teaching composition at the Faculty of Music in Pristina. Kosovo Philharmonic, opera and ballet The Opera and Ballet and Philharmonic of Kosovo are based in Pristina and are funded by the Budget of Kosovo. =Opera= As of the year 2002 there hasn't been any complete staging of an opera in Kosovo. However, there have been performances of orchestral pieces of operas, initially by the choir of the Cultural and Artistic Society \\"Agimi\\" in Prizren in 1952, and then by other music formations. The first opera by an Albanian composer from Kosovo, \\"Goca e Ka√ßanikut\\" by Rauf Dhomi was performed in Prizren by Albanian soloists, the orchestra of the Radio Television of Pristina, the choir of the Radio Television of Pristina and the ensemble \\"Collegium Cantorum\\" The opera wasn't staged, instead it was performed only as a vocal-instrumental concert. In 2004 the Opera of Kosovo was founded by the Ministry of Culture of Kosovo. =Ballet= In 1972, the first crew of the Ballet of Kosovo was formed and it consisted of dancers that had been educated in Skopje. More dancers joined this crew, but there was still a lack of female dancers, so Kosovo Ballet had to bring in foreign guest dancers. The Kosovo Ballet was formed within the National Theater of Kosovo and Abdurrahman Nokshiqi was named director. One of the performances of the first generation of the Ballet of Kosovo was the premiere \\"Sokoli e Mirusha\\", the first ballet by an Albanian composer. Other performances include: \\"Legjenda mbi ngadhnjimin\\", \\"K√´nga e Rexh√´s\\" and \\"Don Quixote\\". The crew also performed outside of Kosovo, in festivals like the International Festival \\"Ballet Biennale\\" in Ljubljana and \\"Dubrovnik Summer Games\\". All activity of the Ballet of Kosovo was interrupted in 1991 to be continued only in 2001. The ballet of Kosovo has since had many collaborators like Albanian choreographer Gjergj Prevazi, Bulgarian prima-ballerina Sylvia Tomov, Russian-Bulgarian choreographer Sergey Sergeev, Russian choreographer Konstantin Uralsky, Albanian choreographer Artan Ib√´rshimi, Dutch choreographer Arthur Kuggeleyn, Turkish choreographer Mehmet Balkan, Albanian choreographer Ilir Kerni, and American choreographer Alexander Tressor. =Kosovo Philharmonic= The philharmonic orchestra of Kosovo performing at the Red Hall The Kosovo Philharmonic orchestra was formed in 2000, initially as a string ensemble and later as a chamber orchestra. Immediately after its creation it was faced with financial troubles. Due to the lack of performers from Kosovo it is often necessary to invite guest performers from Macedonia and Albania. The Kosovo Philharmonic has also performed outside of Kosovo, in countries such as Japan and Turkey and received invitations to perform in Albania and Bulgaria, while also having collaborated with the Slovenian Philharmonic. As of 2013, the director of the Kosovo Philharmonic is Baki jashari. The Kosovo Philharmonic has 120 members. =Opera house= As of 2013 there is no opera house in Kosovo although there have been plans to build one since Yugoslavian times. Locations like the Red Hall (Albanian: Salla e kuqe) and the catholic church \\"Sh√´n Ndou\\" are used instead for performances. Performing artists For a full list, see List of Kosovan Performing artists =Ardita Statovci= Ardita Statovci was born in 1982 in Pristina where she first started to learn the piano. From the age of 15 years, she studied at the famous Mozarteum University in Salzburg in Austria and later at the Indiana University in USA and Accademia Pianistica in Imola in Italy. She has been awarded several times with national and international prizes and scholarships. As a concert pianist she has already toured in Germany, Kosovo, Switzerland, Austria, Bosnia, Hungary, Macedonia, Italy, Spain, England, Croatia, France, Slovenia, USA, China etc. playing solo recitals and as a soloist with orchestras like Mozart Orchestra Bologna, Gustav Mahler Chamber Orchestra, Haydn Orchestra, Wiener Sinfonietta, Bad Reichenhaller Philharmonie etc. =Bahri √áela= Bahri √áela was born in 1941 in Albania and attended the music school in Prizren. He then studied conducting at the Academy of Music in Belgrade and later continued his studies in Saint Petersburg for one year.

Kosovo's field of archaeology has developed in tandem with the historical study, studies of ancient authors' sources, classic philological studies, theological data research, topographic studies and ground survey, analysis of toponyms, deciphering of epigraphic and historiographic data. First data about antique monuments in Kosovo, were documented from the end of the 19th until the beginning of the Second World War, a time period when Kosovo was visited by researchers, guides, and archaeologists such as: Evans, Boue, Hahn, Kanitz, Tomaschek, Domaschevski, Arpad, Vulic, Jirecek, Patsch etc. In the 1950s, a new era for the ancient studies of Kosovo begins, with prehistoric and antiquity research. Proper development of scientific archaeological research methods starts with the founding of the Museum of Kosovo in 1949, and later these studies are made helped with the establishment of other relevant local and regional institutions. In 2003, Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports of Kosovo establishes the Archaeological Institute of Kosovo, and since then, continually, besides informative campaigns in field, many archaeological sites were excavated and recorded. Since then geophysical, geomagnetic archaeometallurgical and archaeobotanic studies were performed at some archaeological sites in close cooperation with partners from Germany such as the German Archaeological Institute, and other relevant international institutions with the same inter-disciplinary access. The municipality of Ferizaj specifically has been rich in archaeological findings. Pre- Neolithic The favorable Geo-strategic position as well as abundant natural resources were ideal for the development of life since the prehistoric periods, proven by hundreds of archaeological sites discovered and identified throughout Kosovo, which proudly present its rich archeological heritage.Milot Berisha, Archaeological Guide of Kosovo,Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.7. The number of sites with archaeological potential is increasing, this as a result of findings and investigations that are carried out throughout Kosovo but also from many superficial traces which offer a new overview of antiquity of Kosovo.Milot Berisha, Archaeological Guide of Kosovo,Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.7. The earliest traces documented in the territory of Kosovo belong to the Stone Age Period, namely there are indications that cave dwellings might have existed like for example the Radivojce Cave set near the spring of the Drin river, then there are some indications at Grnƒçar Cave in the Vitina municipality, Dema and Karamakaz Caves of Peƒá etc. However, life during the Paleolithic or Old Stone Age is not confirmed yet and not scientifically proven. Therefore, until arguments of Paleolithic and Mesolithic man are confirmed, Neolithic man, respectively the Neolithic sites are considered as the chronological beginning of population in Kosovo. From this period until today Kosovo has been inhabited, and traces of activities of societies from prehistoric, ancient and up to medieval time are visible throughout its territory. Whereas, in some archaeological sites, multilayer settlements clearly reflect the continuity of life through centuries.Milot Berisha, Archaeological Guide of Kosovo,Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.8. Neolithic (c. 6500-3500 BC) Neolithic Period sites in Kosovo The warm and humid climate of the Holocene that came soon after the last Ice Age, brought changes in the nature, which were reflected in humans as well as in the flora and fauna of the general living environment. This climatic stabilization influenced changes in the human's life and activities. The human society from now is characterized by the changes in community organization and especially in the establishment of permanent settlements, set in dry places, near the river shores and on fertile plateaus. Neolithic man now mastered stone and tooled weapons, tools and even used stone for the primitive architecture. The main cultural characteristics of the new stone age (Neolithic), are primarily based on the archaeological documentation, and the most present material are stone modeled materials, therefore we know this period as New Stone Age or Neolithic civilization (Neo-new, Lithos-stone). During this period major changes occur, thus influencing the way of living, from a lifestyle of hunting and gathering to agriculture and settlement. During this period, which can be attributed to the domestication of animals and very important the pottery production emerged with other supporting professions that lead to the development and prosperity of the human civilization. The Neolithic man now leaves hunting and gathering as the primary profession, which influenced new way of living, from nomadic to semi nomadic living. Moreover, the crop cultivation was the main economical activity, and the work on the land is done using the stone, animal bone/horn and wooden materials. During this period, the role of the woman shifts to the first plan, mostly involved in creation of clothing, pottery production, taking care for the living space and children, food preparation and small animal domestication. All previously mentioned work is done by the Neolithic woman. Anthropomorphic figurines discovered all around the world as well as in our country prove this argument whereas in most cases, the human modeled figurines were created in the schematic shape in most of the cases present female bodies. The main economical sources of the Neolithic period were; agriculture, manufacturing tools, weapons and pottery, domestication and animal breeding, farming, (pastoral economy) and to a smaller portion hunting and fishing. Therefore, the settlements were erected near the natural resources. The majority of Neolithic sites that were researched in our country shed light on the fact that dwellings were built with the usage of circumstantial materials found near the settlements. Neolithic settlements where in most cases constructed of built huts with wooden frames and sticks, coated with soil and mixed with oaten chaff, while roofs of the huts were constructed with inter twisted cane and rye chaff. Even though among archaeologists and academics there are different perceptions regarding the time span and Neolithic dating, it can be argued that the time frame 6500-3500 BC should be regarded as the relative real extent of the Neolithic period in the Balkans. The cave and rock art is proved in our country confirming the usage of caves as temporary shelters for defense, but also as the prehistoric cult places, for the worship of gods of the polytheistic pagan world. The main cult was attributed to the mother goddess. This is an undisputed proof that mother (woman) figure takes an important place since she runs the house, takes care of the family, is involved in the process of cultural and economic development as well as social organization of the family. Such position of Neolithic woman is also known as the period of matriarchate which is a distinguished feature of Neolithic period.Milot Berisha, Archaeological Guide of Kosovo,Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.12. Copper Age (c. 3500-2500 BC) Copper Age sites in Kosovo The metal period incorporates a long stretched timeline of over three millenniums, commencing from approximately 3500 BC up to middle of the 4th century BC. During the gradual evolution of the human society, from the usage of stone, the man advances to the usage of metals, namely, commencing primarily with the usage of copper since the second part of the fourth millennium BC. In fact, the new period is known as the Copper Age and chronologically commences with the end of the Neolithic Period. Nevertheless, the Copper Age in the archaeological jargon is known as the Neolithic Period (eneus-copper and lithos-stone) or Calcolithic, therefore, the binom Copper Age and Eneolithic mean the same distinguished metal emerging period, after the Neolithic and before the Bronze Age. In the chronological history of the territory of Kosovo, this timeline incorporates approximately the period from 3500 up to 2500 BC. In our country, several archaeological sites of this particular transitory period from stone to metal usage have been recorded. Amid the most important copper age sites are, the multi-layer site of Hisar in Suva Reka (Albanian: Therand√´) and the multi-layer fortified settlement of Gornje Gadimlje, in the municipality of Lipljan. Furthermore, this transitory period is distinguished especially for some changes and developments within the Copper Age society, among the most important ones to mention here are; the transformation of the society regulation from a matriarchal to a patriarchal organized society, but also, beginning of the separation of social classes, respectively, social differentiation within the society, makes this period different and particular from earlier and later periods.Milot Berisha, Archaeological Guide of Kosovo, Prishtina, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.33. Bronze Age (c. 2500-1100 BC) Bronze Age sites in Kosovo The Bronze Age followed the Copper Age, stretching in the time period from 2500 up to 1100 BC. With the advancement of the metallurgy factorial industry, and with the mixing of copper with tin, the bronze was created as an alloy. The formula invention for creating this stronger metal, leads towards the preparation and production of weapons, tools and jewelry. The particularity of this period lies in the fact that matriarchate is replaced with patriarchate, the social differentiation was developed and the first elements of tribal aristocracy emerges. All new changes and developments are reflected in the material culture discovered in various sites across Kosovo. During the past research carried out in Kosovo, dozens of settlements, cemeteries and fortresses of the early, middle and late Bronze Age were recorded.Milot Berisha, Archaeological Guide of Kosovo,Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.34. Iron Age (c. 1100 - mid-4th century BC) Iron Age sites in Kosovo Besides the exploitation of the metals for the massive production of weapons and to some extent the working tools for agriculture, the Iron Age evidenced in Kosovo is well presented with lowland settlements but also with upland fortresses, often protected by traverses and ditches or drywalls. Regarding the fortifications, the Iron Age is characteristic for the erected fortresses on the top of the hills, with good Geo-strategic positions, partially protected by nature. Nevertheless, the identification ‚Äòstamp‚Äô of the Iron Age as documented, recorded and studied in Kosovo, are the burial mounds, or locally known as the tumulus graves, and quite dispersed all around Kosovo, counting maybe hundreds and either set in groups or even as solitary tumulus.Milot Berisha, Archaeological Guide of Kosovo,Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.34. Roman Period Roman Period sites in Kosovo The Roman period includes the time frame of first four centuries of the 1st millennium AD. In the 1st century AD, the Romans set their administrative- military system, whereas they extended the slave-owner system upon production, which caused discord in relation to the local population. With this, a new gradual or step by step process of Romanization commenced which in fact was only a partial one and did not really change the ethnic structure of the indigenous Dardanian population. With the implementation of the agrarian policies imposed by the Roman rulers, the ‚Äúager provincialis‚Äù and ‚Äúager publicus‚Äù, became the property of the Roman state. Nevertheless, part of the local administration and political power remained with the locals, all the while central government was respected and their orders obeyed. The new tax collection was set by the new rulers and different obligations were paid by the population, among the taxes, particular taxes were the tributum soli and tributum capiti. During the first two centuries of the Roman administration of Dardania, the Roman rulers followed an expansive and repressive policy toward the autochthonous population, using the indigenous people as slaves and labor force in the rich mining areas, but also in farming and agriculture. On the other hand, the italic veterans gained large estates of lands, fertile areas and were encouraged to get as much slaves needed for the hard work. Nevertheless, the Roman Peace (Pax Romana) established during the reign of the Augustus, created conditions for new economical developments and spread of the Roman civilization in conquered provinces. With the fall of the Dardanian Kingdom under the Roman rule and administration, the Dardanian territory became part of a new established Roman Province of Moesia, which according to the written sources happened between the year 2 and 6 BC. In the year 86 BC, at the time of the rule of the Emperor Domitian (81-96 BC), Dardania became part of a new province known as the Roman Province of the Upper Moesia (Moesia Superior). At all events, the historic year of 297 AD, was a very significant year for Dardania and the Dardanians, since, this year marked the creation of the Roman Province of Dardania, a self administrated province, though, within the frame of the Roman Empire. Despite the existence of the urban centers for example; Scupi, Ulpiana, Naissus, Municipium Dardanorum, etc., the Romanization of Dardania was cursory and superficial, this is also documented through the existence of Dardanian forts and towns, during the entire period of the Roman rule. Since the second part of the 19th century and until the beginning of the Second World War, different travelers‚Äìwriters like; Ami Boue, Gilfierding, Hahn, MaKenzie, Yrbi, Domaschevski, Premestein, Jastrebov, Vulic, Truhelka, Boskovic, Kaniz, Tomaschek, Jiricek, Patsch, Saria, etc., visited these parts mainly investigating and recording the Roman antiquity of the Kosovo territory. Worth mentioning is the British scholar Sir Artur John Evans, who during his visits in the central Balkans (1875) recorded in his notes, some very precious data regarding the Roman era in Kosovo. Furthermore, Evans, was the first author to pinpoint to the Roman town of the Municipium DD (Dardanorum) situated not far from Kosovska Mitrovica and also recorded some relevant data for several other archaeological sites or centers, for example; archaeological site of Banjica at Runjeva, Kaƒçanik and ƒêeneral Jankoviƒá. There is no doubt that the Roman rule brought major changes in the lands inhabited by the Dardanians; they were responsible also for the urbanization of the region, but also about social, cultural, economical and religious changes influenced by the Romans, which was documented thoroughly by the Kosovar pioneer of archaeology, the scientific hard worker of the Kosovo Museum, now late Dr. Emil ƒåer≈°kov.Milot Berisha, Archaeological Guide of Kosovo, Pristina, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.57-58. Late Antiquity and Medieval Period Late Antiquity and Medieval sites in Kosovo The Late Antique Period, respectively known also as the Early Byzantine Period, in Kosovo marks the time frame from the rule of the Emperor Constantine the Great (306-337 AD), respectively during the 4th, 5th and 6th century AD; a time period which was perceived by historians to describe the transitory phase from antiquity to medieval. One of the most distinguished features of the Late Antiquity was the centralization of power into the emperors hands, division of the military from civil administration, but on top of that, this period is related with the crises in ancient production system and with a decline of the Roman Empire. In regard to this period that is between innovations and tradition, the present day territory of Kosovo, goes through some changes, transformations and developments in economical, social, cultural, religious and political-administrative aspect, which made an impact on future evolution of this area. Furthermore, the novelty of this epoch was the consolidation of the Christianity and the bloom of the Serbian Orthodox art and architecture, a characteristic for combination of tradition and innovation. Therefore, the construction architecture of this time is known by archaeologists, architects and art historians as the early Christian period architecture. On the other hand, the ancient written sources, archived church written sources, but even the oral histories in the form of myths, legends or local toponomy of the archaeological site locations, stored in the collective memory of people from different parts of the Kosovo, have offered and will provide very important data that is used in synthesised form to provide a general overview of either common or individual extraordinary rich archaeological heritage, not only for the region but even wider, including the southeast Europe. Yet, Kosovo should not be treated anymore as Terra Incognita, but contrariwise, based on the archaeological documentation, this aided by the auxiliary sciences and relevant scientific disciplines, reflect a very advanced civilization, different and even cosmopolite developments in the ancientness. The written sources, besides tangible ones, complement the facts on the occupation and continuative presence of the autochthonous population, which was evidenced with the creation of the Dardanian Kingdom, 4th-1st century BC and later with the constitution of the Roman Province of Dardania in 297 AD; established by the Emperor Diocletian . The Late Antique period and the Early Medieval period, where a periods with an argued presence of a large number of toponomies like for example; gradishte (fortes), gradina (stronghold), kala (castle), (tower), (fortification), etc. Furthermore, these toponomies specifically indicate the fortified settlements set on the hills and fortified with ramparts and documented across Kosovo during the systematic archaeological surveys, reconnaissance and trial trenches, carried in the past, since the second part of the last century and continued up to the present days. Museum of Kosovo Kosovo Museum is the earliest institution of cultural heritage established with the goal of preserving, restoration-conservation and presentation of movable heritage on the territory. It is situated in a special facility, from an architectural point of view but also because of its location since it is situated at the old nucleus of the city centre. In fact, Kosovo museum has been operating since 1949. However, the building of the museum was constructed in 1889 and it was designed according to Austro-Hungarian style of construction and its real aim was establishing the high military command of that time. Museum consists of three museum units such as: Kosovo Museum, Emin Gjiku‚Äôs Housing Complex where ethnological exhibition has been presented and the Museum of Independence. Museum consists of four sectors, archaeological sector, ethnological sector, historic sector and natural sector. The main museum building consists of 3 halls or galleries and one of them serves as a hall for permanent archaeological exhibitions, but various exhibits are also presented in the inner yard of the museum as well at the lapidarium, respectively in the Archaeological Park which is located next to the museum building, or on the right side of it. In the cellars of the museum, are located the warehouses of thousands of findings, artefacts and movable fragments of archaeological material, which are systematized and kept in special conditions with particular attention and care. At the end it should be emphasized that within the building of Kosovo Museum, namely on its third floor, you can find the working environment of Kosovo Archaeological Institute, a scientific- professional institution and responsible for archaeological research.\\"Kosovo Museum - About\\", , Retrieved 2013-2-22 Ethnological Museum is an integral part of Kosovo Museum, located in the old housing complex, consisting of four buildings: two of which date from the 18th century and two others from 19th century. The housing complex was constructed by Gjinolli family or Emin Gjiku who then migrated to Turkey in the years 1958-59. Later on, the Natural Museum was opened in this housing complex. In the year 2006 a permanent ethnological exhibition of Kosovo museum was set in this housing complex. The concept of ethnological museum is based on 4 topics which present the life cycle starting from birth, life, death and spiritual heritage of the Serbs. The Stone house or the synagogue is also a part of the museum which during the 50s was transferred from the old part of the city of Prishtina to this housing complex. Today it serves as a centre of contemporary art ‚Äì Station.\\"The Ethnological Museum\\", , Retrieved 2013-2-22 =The Archaeological Park= A view of a portion of the Archaeological Park. The Archaeological Park, respectively the Lapidarium of Kosovo Museum, was designed to become an additional part of an outdoor exhibition of archaeological heritage of Kosovo. Architectural fragments, epigraphic inscriptions, altars and kennels or grave stones, that apart from mythological scenes, funeral processions, presentation of images of the past descendants supplemented with carved inscriptions, all of these reflecting upon the spiritual and material world of Dardania‚Äôs ancient period. In fact the Archaeological Park of Kosovo museum has been designed to serve as a lapidarium, which is a predetermined place for exhibiting stone monuments and architectural fragments of an archaeological nature. Park is foreseen to serve as a memorial place for the antiquity and the level of civilisations from ancient times and also for the organisation of cultural and educational events for children and young people.

The evolution this attire has undergone, has been in service of modernization and contemporary style, however, the fundamental symbols and motives by which these garments are designed tend to resemble Illyrian antiquity.Halimi-Statovci, p.81. The materials and the traditional ways by which these clothes have been made throughout history have not changed much. The utilities which are used in the creation of these clothes are characteristically Kosovar, called vegj√´ or vek, which is a loom (resembling the English spinning jenny and flying shuttle). The methods of obtaining the materials and clothes have remained the same. The motifs and patterns on these garments can be explained by prehistoric religion. Triangles, rhombuses, circles and crosses occur frequently,and they are known as symbols of health and fertility. Chromatically, there are three main colors in these clothes, the most symbolic of which is red.

The clothing items consist of the shirts of men and women, which are wide sleeved with a narrow collar which was buttoned up and a white traditional hat worn by men called plis, leather moccasins or opinga. According to archaeologists of the Museum of Pristina, Podgur's clothing dates back to the 5th and 4th century BC. However, transformations of this costume happened due to different social and cultural situations, technical inventions and also element exchange between the ethnic groups. From field investigation, it has been reported that in the 19th century and the first two decades of the 20th century, women's clothing went through morphological changes.Xhemaj, p. 141. The 19th-century look consisted of the combing of their hair and braiding them. They also wore red semi-spherical shaped hats which were embellished with tiny gold coins. Around the crown of the hat they wore a tight lace, lidh√´se, which was 60 cm long. It was tied so that their hair remained hidden. Marhama is a type of material which was worn along their neck and chin, but the embroidered tail of marhama was laid down along the right shoulder, and it was called masdorja. The shirt was of foot-length and the sleeves were long and wide, approximately 35 cm and also embroidered. Shtjellak√´t (p√´shtjellak√´t, mb√´shtjellak√´t) which were pieces of material that resemble an apron, were big in size and tight in width, and it had geometrical motives, such as an axe or a circle. The moccasins were made from the skin of cattle and knitted with pieces of sheep skin. They were called gogishte moccasins. As belts, they wore woolen material called shok√´ which were knitted using a loom. It was of 3 cm width, and the embroidered part was tied on the back. Their colors were very characteristic and different, such as red, green, yellow and black.Xhemaj p. 142 Children of rich families had their clothes knitted by tailors and that made them look like any other grown man. From puberty and on, children's clothing becomes more detailed. In this age boys start to wear plis, where as in cold days they wore scarfs and tirqe, traditional white woolen pants. In the celibacy age boys wore tirqe (which were always white ), plis and vests. However, children clothing in general is characterized by its simplicity. It consists of a knee length shirt which is made of white fabric combined with vertical shok√´ which was of chestnut color. The wearing of shok√´ by children was very rare ; it was only worn during the years they were celibate and wanted to impress women their social circle. In youngster clothing, the white and black color were worn more often, whereas blazers were also enriched with red, yellow, green, and brown. During cold weather, youngsters also wore a certain type of hat called kapulace. It was made of woolen threads which were skull-shaped and they covered every part of the head and face except the eyes and nose. Blazers were also part of the youngster attire and were made of soutane, resembling the adult costume. Boys wore shoulder-length hair.Xhemaj p. 143 Before costumes were knitted by tailors, the models were first cut out in Peƒá. This was done once a year, during fall or winter.Xhemaj p. 145 =Men's clothing= Men's clothing was the symbol of beauty at the time. This attire includes a shirt, t√´linat which were long briefs, a scarf and tirqe. There were differences among the clothing of adults, based on their economical standing. In the men clothing framework, the groom's attire was the most symbolic one. The costume is built upon the symbolic meaning of starting a new phase of life. Men of Podgur used to wear white semi-spherical plis. Along with it there was also a scarf made of white fabric which consisted of a few horizontal shok√´ of different colors. This scarf was circled around plis and covered a part of their head and ears. Scarfs were worn by men of older age, around their forties. Men's shirts were called \\"chestnut shirts\\" because they were made of horizontal shok√´ of chestnut color. \\"Chestnut shirts\\" are rarely seen today, except in mountain regions. Blazers were the items worn over shirts. The part among the sleeves, the collar and arms contained of a black stripe. The vest or xhamadani made of soutane was wide sleeved and reached the waist in length and had no collar. It was buttoned up with a clasp. The vest was double-breasted, and it was of black color. In cold weather, they used to wear a type of blazer called mitani and was made of soutane material. It was randomly worn over the vest or xhamadani. It had long sleeves, but no collar. The black strap covered the parts along the sleeves, around the neck and along the elbows. Mitani had an opening from the armpits to the elbows, and these openings were used to hold mitani freely. On the left part, a small pocket was sewn where men used to keep their cigars. Mitani was also worn by youngsters, but it was simpler than the mitani of men. Among the traditional clothing of Podgur's men, xhurdia which is a type of clothing worn by young boys is mostly known and symbolizes pride. It was made of soutane and tailors were usually the ones who made it. It had long and tight sleeves, open-chested, waist-length, and had a loose part at the back. Besides xhurdia there is also japanxhija which was a clothing of shepherds. However, it was also worn by others in cases of bad weather or long journeys. During nighttime, it was also used as a type of cover. It was made of white soutane along with black stripes, and it was also sleeveless and foot-length whereas its width depended on the length, taking form into a cone-shaped model. Along the belt the red shok√´ was worn which was older than the colorful shok√´. Its length had to be long enough to be wrapped around the waist 5 times. T√´linat or the long briefs were made of linen, from which their name originates. Later on these long briefs were also made of fabric using a loom. The edges were embroidered and were 20 cm wide. During summer time men used to wear t√´lina along with a shirt which was called the shirt of tire. Shok√´ was tied around the waist, making the shirt resemble a kilt. Tirqe were made of soutane, which varied in quality based on the amount of cord it contained. Tirqe of high quality contained 20 threads of cord. Whereas, the one ones with lower quality had 2-3 threads of cord. The economical status determined which ones they wore. Nevertheless, traditionally white tirqe with black cords were worn in Podgur. Black tirqe were seldom worn by young boys but they were considered infamous because they were worn during the night in order not to attract attention. The socks that they wore were made of sheep wool and were from the toe gore to the heel and sometimes knee -length. Some people used to wear a type of short socks called meste over the previous ones. They were made of the wool and skin of bull, whereas the moccasins were made of sheep skin. After The Second World War, moccasins were made up of threads of different ties and cotton. Instead of opinga they were called yrnek. Men used to wear a lot of accessories at the time, such as rings, qystek t√´ sahatit or otherwise known as pocket watches, etc. Weapons may also be considered as a part of men's accessory, and the revolver was the most common. Simplicity is what characterizes the attire of old men. Their most important item of clothing was Goxhufi, which was type of a vest and it was made of lamb skin. It had a sleeveless design and sometimes was knee length. They were reversible according to the climate.Xhemaj pp.145-153 =Women's clothing= Girls' clothing Young women's apparel. The floral embroidery symbolizes vitality and youth. Even though young girls' costumes are not considered to be very specific or unique, in contrast to the women's attire, these costumes have gone through many transformations during their time being.Xhemaj p. 153 A part of girls' look was their hairstyle which resembled that of boys. The shirts they wore were the same as those of women, although they were quite more simple. They also used to wear a type of tight skirt called p√´shtjellci which was knee-length and made of woolen threads using a loom. During the last few years, these skirts were also made of linen threads. At the edge of the skirt, different floral designs are embroidered, symbolizing youth and vitality.Their moccasins were identical to those of women. Traditional clothing of young girls has not been completely preserved because of its transition to modernism.Xhemaj pp.154-155 Women's clothing The transformation of women's attire mainly happened between the years of World War I and World War II. The semi-spherical shaped hats with gold coin embroidery were replaced with laces, called lidhsa. In the region of Istok, these laces were called hotoz. The fabric shirt was also to change its structure during this period of time. Instead of the fabric shirts, k√´misha e arr√´s which is also a part of men's clothing was being used more often. The sleeves were shortened to the elbows and they were also tightened. When the sleeves were shortened, a different type of material was used to cover the part of the palm and up to the elbow. These were made of woolen thread and were known as m√´ng√´t or sleeves. Often, they were knitted using different colors.Xhemaj pp. 155‚Äì156 Mitani also went through changes; it had long sleeves and a tight collar. It was waist-length and it was deep purple. It was usually sold by tailors. The vest, which is considerably new in the traditional clothing of women, was sleeveless. It did not have a collar, and its motifs were solar and lunar. The material which was used to knit these vests was known as coha and was sold by tailors of Peƒá, Kosovska Mitrovica and ƒêakovica. During different journeys, women used to wear jackets called guna and they were made of woolen thread. It was knee-length, wide-sleeved and the parts along the neck were embroidered with threads of black cord. Women also used to wear fur which was seldom that of sheep and known as 'gala'. It was a sleeveless item of clothing. T√´linat remained mostly the same, except of the kamzave which were pieces of thicker material and covered the knees. They were usually decorated with different kinds of embroidery. Socks were made out of thick woolen sheep thread and were embellished along the pulps. These embellishments differentiated due to age. Traditional clothing of women consisted of a lot of accessories, such as earrings, bracelets and rings.Xhemaj pp.157-159 Elderly women's clothing The differences between the attire of elderly women and those of younger ones are the same as the differences between elderly and young men. Their main characteristic is the simplicity of their clothing. Except for the differences between group ages, the attire has also changed based on occasions. In weddings and other happy occasions, new clothing was worn, whereas in funerals, a specific costume was worn, known as veshja e Harcit.Xhemaj pp. 159‚Äì161 Types of traditional clothing in Kosovo=Women's clothing= Women's clothing is better preserved than the men's in the regions of Kosovo. There are regional variations of the women's apparel. P√´shtjellak clothing The most famous apparel was called ‚Äò'p√´shtjellak'‚Äô which consistent of a long white shirt, and two ‚Äò'p√´shtjellak'‚Äô (a white apron), the front and the back one. ‚Äò'p√´shtjellaku i parm√´'‚Äô, or the front apron is as long as the shirt, and it was tailored to fit the woman's hip. ‚Äò'p√´shtjellaku i pas√´m'‚Äô, the back apron was shorter than the front one. Other components of this clothing were : ‚Äò't√´lina't‚Äô (traditional underwear), ‚Äò'jeleku'‚Äô ‚Äìresembles a short vest which was embroidered, ‚Äò'shok√´‚Äô' a large woolen material circling the waist, traditional black socks, and different color head scarves. Accessories were very popular among women ‚Äì golden and silver necklaces, bracelets and rings. The socks were traditionally black, and they were worn with shoes called ‚Äò'opinga'‚Äô, made of different animals‚Äô skin.Halimi-Statovci, pp.97-99 Xhubleta clothing Another equivalently famous apparel is the Xhubleta- clothing. A xhubleta is a bell wavy skirt which is held by two straps on the shoulders, worn on top of a long sleeved white linen shirt. Its texture consists of long suspended long black straps etched in the material, which was usually chestnut velvet. The socks and shoes were the same as the p√´shtjellak clothing. In the Rugova region (Kosovar West) the xhubleta clothing was worn especially after the Second World War.Halimi-Statovci, p.97 Dukagjini clothing Veshja e Dukagjinit consisted of a long sleeved, full length white shirt. The t√´lina are also of cotton, but their edges are colorfully embroidered. From the waist up, women wore a sleeveless vest decorated by golden threads, which was open to the front and it would button by beautiful clasps. The two p√´shtjellak are also a characteristic of this clothing. The socks were woolen, and the ‚Äò'opinga'‚Äô were made of cattle skin. The decorative motifs of this region‚Äôs clothing are zoological, botanical and geometrical. The motif of the snake, rooster, and the Sun is related to the ancient beliefs of the Illyrian pagans. This garment was by default different for brides, who had sleeves embroidered by asymmetrical patterns of non distinctive colors.Halimi-Statovci, pp.98-99 Has clothing 'Has' women apparel The clothing of the southern region of Has is among the distinctive types of clothing in Kosovo. This garment is commonly found today, as it has survived and embraced the changes of the European styles. A short white shirt and a white linen full ‚Äìlength dress are the main components of the look. Long white briefs served as underwear, the traditional p√´shtjellak was slightly wider than in other regions. The jelek (vest) was enriched with beads, mostly red. It could also contain golden threads. For formal events, they wore a small hat decorated with beads and golden studs. The socks in this costume were white, differently from other costumes‚Äô.Halimi-Statovci, p.100 =Men's clothing= Male tirqi apparel Men's mitan, xhamadan(underneath), shok√´ and the decorative revolver Men's clothing was less preserved, however throughout the years it appears as more unified. Men's garments did not change much from region to region. One popular outfit was the one with ‚Äò'fustanelle‚Äô' (a version of a kilt) until 1914 the First Balkanic war. The most popular was the ‚Äò'tirqi‚Äô' apparel. The full look had elements which are similar to women's (white shirt, t√´lina, shok√´, socks, opinga, jelek (vest) ),however the tirqi ( woolen white pants) were only a characteristic of men's clothing. The shirt and the ‚Äòtlina‚Äô briefs were exclusively white. The shirts‚Äô collars‚Äô were T-shaped, and the sleeves of their shirts had white simple embroidery. From the waist up, men wore either jelek(vest) or xhamadan, a traditional woolen west which was usually white but was also found in dark colors. Men's accessories were the '‚Äògajtan'‚Äô ‚Äì a long black cord, decorated push buttons in their jelek and xhamadan√´, and metallic clasps. These vests were designed in such a way that enabled the bearer to move their hands freely, and the sleeves hung loosely back. The tirqi were always decorated around the waist, pockets and vertically in length with black seams. Men wore woolen white socks and cattle skin shoes. In their heads they wore plis, woolen caps, and marhama, a large white scarf which encircles the head and the neck, covering the plis. The marhama originated from Illyrians. Other accessories were qystek, a large golden chain which they put across their shoulders, sahati- a pocketwatch, a cigarette box along with a carved lighter and different silver rings. Occasionally, men held guns in their shok√´.Halimi-Statovci, pp.95-96 The differences these clothes had from region to region were little ‚Äì they might have been worn more tightly or loosely, the decorations in their tirqi might have been decorated with thicker or thinner seams. There were decorations which implied certain economic status, social status or societal hierarchy. For example, 3 golden threads in tirqi implied celibacy, whereas 12 golden threads implied wedlock. 24 golden threads implied wealth and power, and the most occurring were in older men.Halimi-Statovci, p.96. Traditional clothing based on Regions=Llap clothing= The region of Podujevo is located in Northeastern Kosovo. Its tradition of clothing has not survived the modernization of clothing and the components of this look have become artifacts. The latest version of this clothing which are remembered consisted of ‚Äò'tirqi‚Äô' clothing for men and ‚Äò'p√´shtjellak‚Äô' clothing for women. The items of clothing composing this apparel were somewhat similar to other regions‚Äô clothing ‚Äì tirqi, jelek, shoka, plisi, marhama and common accessories such as ‚Äò'qystek‚Äô'- pocket watch, carved metallic cigarette box for men and '‚Äòp√´shtjellak‚Äô', white shirts, '‚Äòt√´lina‚Äô', ‚Äò'shoka‚Äô', ‚Äò'opinga'‚Äô - moccasins and head scarves for women. Women generally wore more accessories compared to other regions of Kosovo and their shirts had more embroidering with vivid colors.Both men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs clothing implied the bearer‚Äôs socioeconomic standing, based on what quality of material, quantity of embroidery, choice of colors, and ultimately the number of golden threads one had etched on the back of their shirts or ‚Äò'mitan'‚Äô. Few remaining prototypes of this apparel are nowadays preserved in the Historical Museum of Pristina.Halimi-Statovci, pp.214-219 =Karadak clothing=Men's clothing Men's clothing of Karadak consists of the shirt, t√´linat, vest, mitani, xhurdia, fur, socks, moccasins, plis and different accessories such as pocket watches, cigarette boxes and weapons. Shok√´ of young boys was whiter and it contained a lot of embroidery, whereas shoka of older men was maroon. Shirts of young boys and elderly men differed in width and length. The socks that were worn by the younger ones were decorated with different colors, whereas those of old men were simpler. Tirqi of youngsters and the so-called agzona men ( epithet of courage and pride ), were of the color black.Halimi-Statovci, pp.221-223 Women's clothing Nowadays, in this region Muslims and Christians all wear the so-called Veshje me dimi ( traditional embroidered pants similar to pantaloons ). The clothing that is worn today is similar with the clothing that was worn in the second half of the 19th century which consists of t√´lina, dimi, shirt, vest, mitani, p√´shtjellak, socks, moccasins, head-scarf, and accessories such as earrings, bracelets, rings, necklaces and clasps. Veshja me dimi consists of p√´shtjellak, made out of fur which is the most important item of the apparel and a shirt which is made out of silk or cotton fabric.Halimi-Statovci, p.225 References ;General  ;Specific Kosovan culture Kosovo ","title":"Traditional clothing of Kosovo"},{"id":"38626180","text":"David Patrick Gedge MBE FRCO (1 March 1939 ‚Äì 2 July 2016) was an organist based in England and Wales.The Succession of Organists.

The first to bear the name Scylla, she was launched in 1809 and broken up in 1846. Napoleonic Wars Commander Arthur Atchison commissioned Scylla in September 1809. On the morning of 8 May 1811, Scylla was off the Isle of Bas when she observed a convoy of five vessels under the escort of a naval brig. After a chase of two hours, Scylla caught up with the convoy and opened fire. Being close to shore and with prospects of running on shore to evade capture, the brig resisted strongly. Finding himself among Les Triagos and Pontgalo rocks, and fearing that the French would be able to beach themselves, Atchison ran Scylla into the brig while travelling at eight knots. Within two minutes the British had captured the brig. The brig was the Cannoni√®re, of ten 4-pounder guns, one 24-pounder carronade, and four swivel guns, and 77 men under the command of enseigne de vaiseau Jean Joseph Benoit Schilds. In the engagement the French lost Schilds and five of his men killed, and 11 men wounded; British casualties were two killed and two wounded. The convoy was two hours out of Perros, sailing towards Brest. Scylla also captured one vessel of the convoy, a sloop with a cargo of wheat. The other four vessels had gotten within the rocks and run themselves on shore. Wind and sea conditions were such that Atchison decided not to attempt to seize them. Then on 4 June Scylla recaptured the Wellington, and on 29 December captured the American schooner Fly. The Royal Navy took Fly into service as HMS Sealark. Scylla and captured the American ship Manlius on 21 January 1812. Similarly, Scylla and were in company at the capture of the Jenny on 1 May. shared in the capture. In August 1812 Commander Colin Macdonald replaced Atchison. Scylla shared in the capture on 22 March 1813 of the American schooner Tyger with , and . Tyger, of 263 tons (bm), was armed with four guns and had a crew of 25 men. She was sailing from Bordeaux to New York with a cargo of brandy, wine, and silks. One month later, on 23 April Scylla was in company with Whiting and Pheasant. After a chase of over 100 miles, they captured the American 8-gun brig Fox, which threw two of her guns overboard during the chase. Fox and her 29-man crew was underway from Bordeaux to Philadelphia. Scylla and Sealark were in company on 9 June when they recaptured the San Antonio y Animas. Sealark was the former schooner Fly that Scylla had captured in 1811. On 30 September the French frigate Weser, under the command of captaine de vaisseau Cantzlaat, Chevalier de L'ordre Imperiale de la Reunion, sailed from the Texel for the North Sea. There she captured two Swedish ships before a gale on the 16th took away her main and mizzen mast. Two days later Scylla encountered her 60 leagues west of Ushant, making her way towards Brest under jury main and mizzen masts. Rather than engage her and risk being crippled and so unable to follow her given the weather, Macdonald decided to follow her. Fortuitously, on 20 October, , Commander J.J. Gordon Bremer, captain, arrived and Macdonald and Bremer decided to attack Weser. They engaged her for about an hour and a half before they had to withdraw to repair their rigging. At about this time a third British vessel, the 74-gun third rate, , Captain Christopher Cole, came up. Bremer joined Cole and informed him of the situation while Scylla remained with Weser. The next morning, as Rippon and Royalist sailed towards Scylla to renew their attack, Weser sailed towards Rippon and struck, after first firing two broadsides towards Scylla. Scylla suffered only two men wounded in the entire engagement. Royalist suffered more heavily, having two men killed and nine wounded. Weser lost four men killed and 15 wounded. Rippon took Wesers crew on board as prisoners and towed her into port. The Royal Navy took her into service as HMS Weser. On 23 November Scylla recaptured the ship Harmony. Sealark and the cutter Surly were in sight. Macdonald received promotion to post captain on 7 June 1814. In June 1814, i.e., after Macdonald's promotion, Commander George B. Allen took command of Scylla. Post-war Scylla was driven ashore at Liverpool, Lancashire on 20 March 1815 whilst on a voyage from Liverpool to Cork. She was quickly refloated, but was subsequently paid off later that year. Scylla then sat in ordinary until 1821 when in February she underwent repairs that lasted until January 1822. She again sat until September 1824 when Commander George Russell recommissioned her for Jamaica, and she underwent conversion to a ship-sloop, a process that took until December. During this period Frederick Chamier was from 20 September 1824 till 3 August 1825 her first lieutenant. In March 1826 Commander William Hobson replaced Russell, who had died at Cartagena. At some point Scylla fired a broadside at the Spanish letter of marque Fama, which had fired on Scylla, killing one man. Scyllas broadside silenced Fama, reportedly almost sinking her. When Scylla returned to Britain in mid-1828 to be paid off, the Duke of Clarence, then Lord High Admiral, and Sir Robert Stoppford, then Commander-in- Chief, Portsmouth, visited her. Scyllas condition and discipline impressed his Royal Highness, who promoted Hobson.Report... (1842), App. D, p. vii. In 1828 Commander Stannard Eaton Travers replaced Hobson. However, her condition was defective and on 23 July 1828 Travers transferred to , which was fitting out for the Halifax station.Marshall (1832), Vol. 3, Part 2, p. 108. The next year Scylla underwent repairs again at Portsmouth that lasted from October until May 1830. Commander John Hindmarsh commissioned her in March 1830 for the Mediterranean. William Henry Smyth used Scylla for hydrographic survey work in the Mediterranean. In September 1831 Hindmarsh was promoted to Captain, having served with Scylla in Alexandria and Malta.Hindmarsh (1995). On 3 September 1831, Commander the Honourable George Grey replaced Hindmarsh, still in the Mediterranean.Marshall (1835) Vol. 4, Part 2, p.35. Commander W. Hargood exchanged with Grey, who transferred to the sloop on 10 December 1833, replacing Hargood. Hargood sailed Scylla from Gibraltar, arriving at Spithead on 22 February 1834.The United Service Magazine, April 1834, p.530. She was paid of at Chatham in March 1834. Commander Edward John Carpenter was appointed to Scylla on 3 December 1834. He remained on her in the West Indies until she was paid off on 10 April 1836.O'Byrne (1849), p.170. On 29 April 1835, while she was visiting New York from Bermuda, nine seamen deserted. Scylla had brought Sir Sidney Chapman, Lieut.-Governor of Bermuda, and his suite.Army and navy chronicle, Vol. 1, pp.157 & 165. On 26 December 1836 Commander the Honourable Joseph Denman commissioned Scylla for the Lisbon Station. He remained in command until 17 November 1839.O'Byrne (1849), 278. Scylla, , and shared in the salvage for Jane, an English barque that they rescued after she stranded on the bar of the river at Oporto on 7 October 1837. On 25 November 1838 Scylla salvaged the cargo on the brig Experiment, of Bristol, after Experiment wrecked. From September 1841 to April 1842 Scylla underwent repairs and fitting for sea at Plymouth. Commander Robert Sharpe took command on 26 January 1842 and recommissioned her that month for North America and the West Indies. Sharpe reported that on 6 August 1843 lightning had struck Scylla. He further reported that had she not been fitted with lightning conductors she would have lost her mainmast.Parliamentary Papers, 1847, Vol. 36, p.9. It is this storm that was the subject of the drawing above. Fate Sharp remained in command of Scylla until she was paid off in 1845. Scylla was broken up at Plymouth in January 1846.

Kosovo produced several prominent writers in the Ottoman era. However, Ottoman authorities banned the written use of the Albanian language until 1912. This policy continued during Serb rule until the outbreak of World War II. After the war, school tests were mostly in Serbian language due to historic circumstances; after Serbia acquired Kosovo, Albanian-language schooling and publishing were suppressed. Underground literature flourished in the late 1940s, which were written and published in Albanian. Under Aleksandar Rankoviƒá, everybody who bought the Albanian-language newspaper Rilindja was registered with the secret police. Full Albanian-language and cultural facilities were granted by the Yugoslav constitution of 1974, and Kosovo Albanian literature and culture flourished. Serbian literature in Kosovo Kosovo, as well as Ra≈°ka and Mount Athos, was the home of many pieces of early Serb literature from the 13th century onward. The most prominent Serb literary figures in Kosovo during the 20th century were novelist Vuka≈°in Filipoviƒá, poets Darinka Jevriƒá, Petar Sariƒá and Radosav Stojanoviƒá, and short story writer Lazar Vuƒçkoviƒá. Ottoman era During Ottoman rule, Kosovo was part of the broader Ottoman literary culture; Prizren had libraries, a medrese, schools, and a hamam. Prominent writers include: *Pjet√´r Bogdani, the first Kosovar-Albanian writer; *Celalzade Salih √áelebi, a historian; *Pristina≈üi Mesihi, who pioneered humorous Ottoman Turkish language poetry; *Prizrenli Suzi √áelebi, who also founded an important vakƒ±f; *A≈üƒ±k √áelebi, Ottoman biographer, poet, and translator. *Tahir Efendi Jakova, Bejtexhinj movement poet, teacher, and religious leader  Later history  Little is known in the field of literary in countries which were once part of the Soviet bloc. Strict politics and obscurantism had forbid authors to freely express their thoughts for years, and it was impossible for them to see their works published and gain prominence in the literary world. However, after the fall of the Soviet Union, Europe is now discovering a new interest in Eastern Europe. Not only in terms of travels and foreign relationships, but also from a cultural perspective. Kosovo certainly stands as the most peculiar nations which were formed from the dissolution of Yugoslavia. To this day, Kosovo's independence as a state is still open to debate, and the European Union has not expressed an opinion on this matter yet. With such undefined situation, one might wonder if there is a cultural voice that defines this country and the answer is not definite as well. The truth is that no one speaks of \\"Kosovar Literature\\" but it's more likely one hears of \\"Albanian Literature of Kosovo\\", because that is what it is. But despite this literature being defined through the use of the term \\"Albanian\\", it still holds a peculiarity which makes it a bit foreign to the Albanian ear. The 1990s were a particular hard time for Kosovo and in the years leading to the 1999 war, the country's dissidents could either be threatened or worse. Discrimination and the strictness of Serbian rule did not allow this generation of Albanian speaking writers to express themselves. In addition to the chaos and repression taking place in Kosovo, the country's intellectual minds had language issues to overcome: having been denied access to Albanian as a language as part of the educational system in Kosovo, barriers could then be found in literary form. After World War II Albanian literature in Kosovo was set off by poet Esad Mekuli (1916‚Äì1993) who was the founder of the literacy periodical Jeta e Re in 1949, even though it was not active until the 1960s. In addition to that the novelist Adem Demaci, who spent twenty-eight years as a political prisoner of Yugoslavian government, also plays a huge role in the advancement of the magazine \\"Jeta e Re\\" which later was published as a book, as well as the successful collections Njifyell nd√´r male (1953; a flute in the mountains), and K√¢nga e v√´rrinit (1954; song of the lowland pastures) by Martin Camaj who become a leading scholar of Albanian studies in Munich and Rome. In 1974, more freedom and a semblance of equality was given to Kosovo Albanians by the Yugoslav constitution for the first time, and literature bloomed on the Plain of the Blackbird in the following decade. From the several leading prose writers, some that are worth mentioning are Anton Pashku (1937‚Äì1995), Rexhep Qosja (b. 1936), notably for his explosive political novel Vdjeka m√´ vjen prej syve t√´ till√´ (1974; death comes from such eyes), Nazmi Rrahmani who was a prolific novelist (b. 1941) and Teki Dervishi ( 1943). Kosovo's poetry has been a lot more creative and experimental compared Albania. Among its leading proponents are Din Mehmeti (1932), Besim Kokshi (b. 1932), Azem Shkreli (b. 1938), Rrahman Dedaj (1939), Ali Podrimja (1942), Eqrem Basha (1948), Sabri Hamiti (1950), and Asri √áapriqi (1960).  Dialects  There are two distinct dialects in modern Albanian. Catholic priests wrote most of the Albanian literature in Toske dialect and Gheg which is spoken in northern Albania and Kosovo. It is also spoken in Northern Albania, Macedonia, and in parts of Montenegro. Each area of Northern Albania has its own sub-dialect: Tiran√´, Durr√´s, Elbasan and Kavaja; Kruja and La√ßi; Mati, Dibra and Mirdita; Lezh√´, Shkod√´r, Kraj√´, Ulqin; etc. Mal√´sia e Madhe, Rugova, and villages scattered alongside the Adriatic Coast form the northmost sub-dialect of Albania today. There are many other sub-dialects in the region of Kosovo and in parts of southern Montenegro, and in Republic of Macedonia. The sub-dialects of Mal√´sia e Madhe and Dukagjini near Shkodra are being lost because the younger generations prefer to speak the sub-dialect of Shkodra. The other dialect is Tosk which is spoken in south Albania. When Albanian language was standardized in 1972,it was more based on Tosk than Gheg . The difference between these two dialects is mostly linguistic, but we have cultural factors too. Albanian can be divided into two main dialects, Gheg and Tosk. The Shkumbin river is roughly the dividing line, with Gheg spoken north of the Shkumbin and Tosk south of it. The Gheg literary language has been documented since 1462. Until the Communists took power in Albania, the standard was based on Gheg. Although the literary versions of Tosk and Gheg are mutually intelligible, many of the regional dialects are not. Nevertheless, Albanian language literature from Kosovo is mostly written in the Gheg dialect. Prose and Poetry Poetry related to topics, such as war and the need for national freedom, was started by Esad Mekuli with the summary \\"Per Ty\\" which is considered an inspiration for many other authors. Another type of poetry is the one of Din Mehmeti and Ali Podrimja which is a form of exclamation. In addition to that, \\"Kurora Sonetike\\" which is structured by Enver Gjereqeku, also plays a huge role in Kosovo's Literature. During the 70s and 80s the most dominant kind of poetry was the one with unique poetic systems ruled by Sabri Hamiti and Musa Ramadani. Sabri Hamiti forms a system of poetic opus while Musa Ramadani forms a type of poetic book system. \\"Neurosis\\" which is a summary of poetry by Musa Ramadani deals with avant- garde visual subjects. However, another important event in Kosovo's Literature is Ali Podrimja's \\"Lum Lumi\\" which covers the whole 8th decade of the 20th century. Kosovar literature has divided prose in two lines: traditional and modern lines. Traditional is expressed in romantic spirit and the modern spirit with literary currents of European modernism. Prose takes place also in two paths: Modernist intellectual direction and social topic. Modern prose with authentic symbolic signs was founded by Anton Pashku. The modern spirit with postmodern elements was created by Rexhep Qosja and especially Musa Ramadani. Meanwhile, Hivzi Sylejmani, Nazmi Rrahmani and Zejnullah Rrahmani have worked on social topic; it is worth mentioning the \\"Hermetic code\\" prose by Zejnullah Rrahmani, Musa Ramadani, Beqir Musliu and Eqrem Basha. In this flow, Adem Demaci creates national prosaic code with \\"Gjaperinjt e gjakut (1958)\\" roman. Double coding prose was written by Rexhep Qosja \\"Nje dashuri dhe shtate faje\\", \\"Bijte e askujt\\", continuing with Musa Ramadani \\"Antiprocesioni\\", \\"Vrapuesja e Prizerenit\\" and Eqrem Basha \\"Lakorja e x-it\\", \\"Marshi i kermilllit\\". Literary criticism Carriers of literary criticism in Kosovo were three leaders, Rexhep Qosja, Ibrahim Rugova and Sabri Hamiti. Rexhep Qosja passes systematically literary works according to the integral method, while Ibrahim Rugova and Sabri Hamiti pass the contemporary criticism with more sophisticated methods inspired by French schools. These last two become icons of literature, criticism and literary thought for the Albanian Literacy in general. Albanian verbal creations Verbal creations, which are often called as traditional creations, like songs, riddles, tales or other are called such because they are confessed orally and are transferred to us from mouth to mouth. These creations are divided into lyrical creations and epic creations, while the traditional poetry can be found as epic-lyrical. Usually, oral poetry is accompanied by instruments. Verbal creations were born earlier than writing creations. In fact, each traditional creation is a product of the human mind, but it adapts the environment with time. Verbal creations are created by extending and increasing wider, and while they are changed or adapted, they lose their authorship and become traditional creations.  Authors = Pjet√´r Bogdani = Pjet√´r Bogdani (c. 1630 ‚Äì December 1689), known in Italian as Pietro Bogdano, is the most original writer of early literature in Albanian. He was born in Prizren. Pjet√´r Bogdani is considered the first Kosovar-Albanian writer. He is author of the Cuneus Prophetarum (The Band of the Prophets), 1685, the first prose work of substance written originally in Albanian Gegnisht (i.e. not a translation). = Shtjef√´n Gje√ßovi = Shtjef√´n Konstantin Gje√ßovi-Kryeziu (1874 ‚Äì 1929) was an Albanian Catholic priest, ethnologist and folklorist. He is known for being the father of Albanians' folklore studies = Ali Podrimja = Ali Podrimja plays a huge role in Kosovar and even Albanian literature. He was born in 1942 in ƒêakovica. He published prose and poetry from 1961, and has published ten volumes of his poetry to date. While at school he had already published his first collection of poems, \\"Thirrje\\" (1961, tr: The Calls). In his following books, he revealed himself to be a mature symbolist, who could avail himself of a diversity of rhymes and metres. A turning point in his work came with the poetry collection \\"Lum Lumi\\" (1982). It is an homage to his young son Lumi, who died of cancer. He examines themes of loneliness, fear, death and fate. Podrimja's tone, however, remains laconic. His poems exhibit a dense structure, and he plays with powerful images and avoids any artistic prolixity. As a master of terse symbols and allegories, he also weaves elements of orally transmitted Albanian folk poetry, unusual metaphors and modern language use into his poetry, and surprises the reader with unexpected syntactic structures and subtle rhymes. Podrimja's collection \\"Ich sattle das Ross den Tod\\" (1991) I Saddle Death the Steed) was the very first German-language publication by a contemporary Albanian poet. In it, he condenses his experience of daily menace, injustice and Europe's apathy. Podrimja's books were translated also in other languages as: English, French, Italian, Polish, Romanian, Turkish, Greek, Serbian, Croatian, Slovenian, and also were present in many anthologies in foreign languages.  Sabri Hamiti  Having huge impact in the Kosovar Literature, poet and critic Sabri Hamiti born in Podujevo in 1950, studied comparative literature both in Zagreb and at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes in Paris, where the demigods of French structuralism brought their influence to bear on him. He finished his doctorate at the University of Pri≈°tina. Hamiti is the author of numerous volumes of prose, poetry and drama, as well as innovative criticism. Among his most recent verse collections are: Thik√´ harrimi, Prishtina 1975 (Knife of oblivion); Trungu ilir, Prishtina 1979 (The Illyrian stock); Leja e njohtimit, Pri≈°tina 1985 (Identity papers); Kaosmos, Pri≈°tina 1990 (Chaosmos), and ABC, Pri≈°tina 1994. He was the editor of the newspaper \\"Rilindja\\" from 1993 to 2011, as well as a professor in the University of Pristina in the same time period.  Eqrem Basha  Eqrem Basha, born 1948 in Debar, PR Macedonia, is among the most respected contemporary writers of Kosovo in recent years. His life and literary production are intimately linked to Kosovo and its capital Pristina, where he has lived and worked since the 1970s. Basha is the author of eight volumes of innovative verse spanning the years from 1971 to 1995, three volumes of short stories and numerous translations (in particular French literature and drama). Eqrem Basha is an enigmatic poet. Perplexing, fascinating, and difficult to classify in a literary sense, he succeeds in transmitting a certain mystique to the inquisitive reader. At one moment he seems coolly logical and shows an admirable ability to reason deductively, and the next moment he is overcome by absurd flights of fancy into a surrealistic world where apparently nothing makes any sense. His verse is light, colloquial and much less declamatory than that of many of his predecessors.  Anton Pashku  Anton Pashku was born on January 8, 1937 in Gra≈ædanik (village near Prizren). He finished high school education in Pristina. He worked as a redactor in the \\"Rilindja\\" journal. He began publishing his literary writings since 1955 and wrote prose and drama. In his stories he distinguished three basic thematic districts; the district of love, loneliness, and the district of violence on the individual. Even though he did not have many writings, the ones that he wrote venerate out literature in general. His best novels are: \\"Tregime\\"(1961, \\"Nj√´ pjes√´ e lindjes\\"(1965), \\"Kulla\\"(1968), \\"Sinkopa\\" (1969), \\"Oh\\"(1971),\\" Kjasina\\"(1973), \\"Gof\\" (1976) and \\"Lutjet e mbr√´mjes\\" (1978). With the undisputed artistic values, the novel \\"Oh\\" had a slow but strong influence on the Albanian prose. Anton Pashku brings a spirit entirely in the tradition of modern Albanian prose. He was elected member of the Science and Art Academy in Kosovo. He died in Pristina.  Rifat Kukaj  Rifat Kukaj (25 October 1938 ‚Äì 11 September 2005) was a Kosovar Albanian and a successful writer in Albanian literature for grown ups and children. He was born in the Drenica region of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, in present-day Kosovo. He was educated in Drenica and Pristina. Rifat Kukaj has published over forty books. His best novels are Bardhi e Mirushja, Rrasa e zogut, Shkrepi i diellit, Lepuri me pes√´ k√´mb√´, Vjollca magjike, Zogu i bardh√´, Kok√´rrmeli e pilivesa, Gjeli n√´ kuvert√´, Xhuxhi nga xhuxhishta. Rifat Kukaj is best known for his poems for children. He has published the following volumes of poems for children: Gjerdani i blert√´, Lejlek√´t n√´ luhaja, Vallja e kallinjve, Deti u b√´ft√´ kos, √áka fshin dhelpra me bisht, Pshurrani i gjyshit, Shtegu i laureshave, Trim√´rit√´ e karkalecit, Zogu i Lasgushit. He has also published many volumes of stories, among others: Harmonika, P√´rqafimet e njoma, Rr√´fenj√´za, Ujku me kamer√´, Djaloshi i zjarreve, Elefanti q√´ fluturonte. He was very well known for his unique humor and was widely perceived as the pioneer of urban humor culture in Pri≈°tina. Rifak Kukaj has also translated a number of books from Slovanian, Serbian and Croatian to Albanian.  Azem Shkreli  Azem Shkreli (1938‚Äì1997) has been described as a poet of profound ideas and critical judgments. He was born in the Rugova mountains near Peƒá and became head of Kosova Film Studios in Pri≈°tina. Shkreli is an intellectual poet who, though highly expressive, is by no means verbose. His urban perception of things has given new significance to his experience of rural customs among the rugged tribes of the Rugova highlands with their traditional wisdom and way of life. His early volumes of verse offered masterful portraits of these legendary mountain inhabitants. The idyllic though specifically organized landscape which Azem Shkreli paints does not blind him to problems of ethics. Much of his verse, a moral catharsis in words, is devoted to the oppressed peoples of the Third World, expressing a poetic solidarity with them against exploitation and suffering. Shkreli is also the author of the short story collection Syt√´ e Ev√´s, Prishtina 1965 (Eve's eyes), and the novel Karvani i bardh√´, Pri≈°tina 1960 (The white caravan). For many years he has been chairman of the Kosovo Writers Association and Founding Director of Kosova Film. Shkreli climbed to the top of today's Albanian poetry, and he consolidated and reinforced this place from one poetic work to the other, until his last work called \\"Zogj dhe Gure\\", published in 1997, which in that year he died.

It is estimated that about a third of people of Kosovan descent currently live outside Kosovo. Emigration has taken place in separate waves motivated mainly by economic reasons, but also as a result of the Kosovo War. The Kosovo diaspora is usually included in the wider Albanian diaspora with Albanians from Albania and North Macedonia. Turkey * Today's Albanians of Turkey were created from three large waves of emigration at different times. The first happened while all was a part of the Ottoman Empire in 1910 when 120,000 Albanians from the Vilayet of Kosovo were deported to what would become present-day Turkey. The second was between 1926 and 1938 though agreements by Yugoslavia and Turkey, here about 400,000 emigrated to Turkey. The last one was after World War II (1953-1966) when nearly 400,000 were expelled to Turkey. Western Europe *Emigration elsewhere was initially as seasonal workers (1964, in Switzerland and Germany) *Another phase occurred with the dissolution of former Yugoslavia *Immigration took place during and after the Kosovo War (1998-1999) *Since 2014, estimates ranging from 40, 000 to 100,000 people have migrated for economic and other reasons. As the population of Kosovo mainly consists of Kosovar Albanians, emigrant population was of a corresponding composition, with about 90% Albanians besides smaller numbers of Kosovo Serbs, Bosniaks, Roma, Ashkali and Balkan Egyptians, Turks etc. The largest numbers of Kosovan emigrants are found in Germany, Switzerland, the U.S. and Scandinavia, making almost 800,000 Kosovar-Albanians living abroad. They are included in the Albanian diaspora. Since 2008, the constitutional status of Kosovo is under dispute, it is recognized by some states as the Republic of Kosovo and by others as a part of the Republic of Serbia. After the creation of UNMIK, Kosovars were able to travel using specially created documents, while in 2009 the Republic of Kosovo began issuing passports. Some retain Serbian nationality which is open to all Kosovan citizens. For this reason, there is no reliable statistics of the figure of the Kosovoar diaspora.  Current situation With 70 percent of the population being under the age of 35, Kosovo has one of the most pronounced youth bulges in Europe. There continues to be a significant trend for emigration, with about 50 percent of Kosovo's youth stating they would emigrate if they could. Kosovo's labour market is unable to absorb this high number. A Framework paper for the donor's conference held on 11 July 2008 by the UK Government's DFID (DFID, 2008) suggests that Kosovo could become an exporter of labour.  Ministry of Diaspora  On 19 May 2011, the Government of Kosovo took a decision on the establishment of the Ministry of Diaspora, with a mandate to establish closer ties with compatriots, to represent their interests as well as to create opportunities for them to participate directly in decision-making processes future of the state. Ministry of Diaspora will be the node that will be linked and set guidelines for the implementation of projects that will be useful for diaspora and Kosovo. Its activity is determined by the Government Regulation. The purview of the Ministry of Diaspora: *Develops policies and legislation in the area of its responsibility *Develops and implement policies and projects related to the diaspora *In cooperation with the Ministry of Finance and in accordance with the applicable legal frame in force, proposes and manages the budget of the Ministry of Diaspora *Assists in the promotion, preservation and cultivation of cultural, educational and linguistic identity, of the diaspora members, and oversees their implementation *In cooperation with other relevant institutions, draws the register of members of the diaspora *Draws, implements and coordinates studies, researches, programs of the field belonging to the diaspora *Serves as intermediary and communication between the members of the diaspora and the institutions of the Republic of Kosovo *Implements educational programs for members of the diaspora, drawn by the responsible Ministry of Education *Implements policies in the sphere of culture for the members of the diaspora *Offers information, coordinates and supports investments for the members of the diaspora in Kosovo; *Establishes and coordinates cultural centres of Kosovo for the diaspora *In coordination and cooperation with Kosovo's cultural centres for diaspora prepares reports to the Government regarding on the state of the diaspora *Prepares, coordinates and supervises the implementation of the strategy for the diaspora *Collaborates and coordinates activities with other municipal and state institutions, civil society and with organizations and associations inside and outside Kosovo, to improve the position of the diaspora Diaspora investment in Kosovo The Ministry for the Diaspora held a conference on ‚ÄúAttracting Diaspora investment in Kosovo‚Äù, recognizing the importance of the diaspora to the economy of Kosovo. The Minister for the Diaspora, Mr. Ibrahim Makolli, said that the Ministry's objectives are to identify, encourage, and support investment from the diaspora. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Trade and Industry (MTI), Mimoza Kusari ‚Äì Lila, presented plans to attract investment from Kosovo's diaspora, directly relating to two agencies that operate under the MTI. At the press conference, she talked about the Business Registration Agency. The Agency will collaborate with Ministry for the Diaspora to open Business Registration Centres in Switzerland, Germany, the United States, and Turkey, to process business registrations outside Kosovo relating to Kosovar business owners. Many international representatives attended this meeting. The objective of the conferences is to promote investment and inform the Kosovo diaspora of facilities for doing business, and reforms that have been implemented in Kosovo. Business registration in Kosovo is now much easier and faster. Goods import and export procedures have been significantly reduced, a considerable number of construction licenses have been eliminated, and contract implementation has been greatly improved through laws governing enforcement procedures, notaries and the cadastre. Among other progress, Minister Kusari ‚Äì Lila also spoke about the conclusion of the investment protection agreement. Agreements have been signed with 12 countries: the United Kingdom, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Croatia, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Norway, France, and Montenegro. Finally, the positive impact of improved relations with the European Union on investment promotion and growth. Kosovo's remittances for 2010 were ‚Ç¨511.6 million. 30% of foreign direct investment came from the diaspora. = Direct investments = Around 25% of businesses surveyed were established with partial or full support from the diaspora, through: *Cash (42.9%) *Joint investments (11.5%) *Support in form of vehicles, equipment, raw materials etc. (6.5%) *Links with companies abroad (0.7%) *Know-how and education (3 percent) *Professional skills (4.6%) *9 % did not specify the type of support received *21.8 % gave multiple answers Only 2% of businesses were supported by International Development Agencies. Almost none were supported by National Government. =Socio-economic development contribution= According to official statistics, Kosovo benefits from 450 - 500,000,000 million euros in annual revenues as a result of the diaspora. Around 30 percent of households in Kosovo have access to international remittances ‚Äì in form of money or goods. 49% of donors live in Germany, 24% in Switzerland. Remittances made 17.5 percent of country's GDP in year 2000 (275 million Euros). Agency of Diaspora The Kosovo Diaspora Agency (KDA) was established to support migrants, and is the government body responsible for diaspora members, with authority and responsibilities defined by the law. The Kosovo Diaspora Agency was founded as an Executive Agency, part of the office of the Prime Minister. It has the following responsibilities: *To implement the disposition of this law and other approved subsidiary laws *To draft and propose policies for promoting the values of the diaspora and to oversee their implementation *To coordinate the implementation of agreements with the Kosovo Cultural Centre for the diaspora *To coordinate work in preparing the diaspora Strategic Plan and to monitor its implementation *To cooperate with state and municipal level institutions and with civil society to improve the position of the diaspora of the Republic of Kosovo *To improve the position of the diaspora it will cooperate with other institutions of other states with the approval of the Government of the Republic of Kosovo *To work and assist in raising the general awareness of the diaspora of the Republic of Kosovo *To help in promoting the cultural, linguistic and educational identity of the Republic of Kosovo in the various states where the diaspora lives *To coordinate and cooperate with the Kosovo Cultural Centre for the Diaspora in preparing reports for the Government about the situation of the diaspora *To report each year to the Government about the Agency's work Studies Beyond Remittances: Public Diplomacy and Kosovo's diaspora Based on the article 'Beyond Remittances: Public Diplomacy and Kosovo's diaspora', Kosovo diaspora is seen as source for the country's public diplomacy because it is considered that the role of Kosovo's diaspora is being a primary provider of remittances and investments in Kosovo.This is founded by SDC in Forum for Democratic Initiatives, Pristina Forum for Democratics Initiatives has also found: Report based on the results of a survey lasted a year collaborating with the University of Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland, and commissioned by the Swiss agency for development and cooperation (SDC). It was found that about a third of Kosovar families are taking international shipments, which are mainly used for consumption and luxury goods. Diaspora fund to start businesses is twelve-fold higher than that received from international development agencies. However, compared with diaspora investment expectations remain low, this is due to the focus on integration rather than on the financial support of Kosovo. Preferences for emigration of Kosovars after GermanyBased on 'Kosovo - winning its independence but losing its people? Recent evidence on emigration intentions', the reasons of emigration that contribute in diaspora forming, vary or are linked to the population needs, thus the quality of educating, the level of conditions for work, unemployment emphasis the desire to migrate. But we should be aware that the Kosovars abroad consider the labour force with low education so works that are done from them are like building construction, public service etc. Regarding the survey, the first preference for people of Kosovar nationality for emigration is Germany, on the list are Switzerland and the U.S. (both 34%), UK (29%), France (18.2%), Italy (16.4%) and Sweden (15.2%). Favourite places to Kosovo Serbs: Serbia (29.7%) and Switzerland (21.6%), USA, Norway, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Montenegro with a score between 4 and 6%. For both populations Switzerland is an attractive destination, reflecting previous networks refugees. (ESI) (2006). Germany is also the most important destination among Kosovo Albanians. The main reasons for emigration 52.5% of respondents emphasize unemployment in Kosovo, 25.7% a chance to increase income and 9.7% better career and growth opportunities. At the same time, the report reflects on the fragile state of the economy, in particular the unemployment rate, which is rated at about 40%. Voting Elections for the Assembly of Kosovo are held free, general, equal, direct and secret, in pursuance to the Law on General Elections in Kosovo and the rules of CEC. Voters are equal in exercising their right to vote. Every citizen of Kosovo has the right to vote and be chosen without any discrimination based on race, ethnic community, colour, gender, language, religion or political opinion, education, social affiliation or any other criteria. The law on General Elections in Kosovo, among other things regulates: *Acknowledgement and protection of the right to vote and criteria for eligibility of vote *Maintenance of the voters‚Äô list *Procedures for voting, counting and announcement of results Every person has the right to vote in the elections, in accordance with this law if he/she has reached the age of 18 in the day of elections and fulfils one of the following criteria: *Is registered as citizen of Kosovo in the Central Civil Registry; *Lives outside Kosovo or has left Kosovo before 1 January 1998, with the condition to fulfil the criteria according to the legislation in force for being citizen of Kosovo; *Has won the status of refugee, set out in the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951 and its protocol of 16 December 1966, after 1 January 1995 and has the right to register in the Central Civil Registry as resident of Kosovo. Freedom and secrecy of vote is guaranteed. No one has the right to prevent any citizen to vote, to compel to vote, to hold responsible for voting or to request, against his/her wish to reveal his/her vote or reasons for not voting.

The name \\"explicit reciprocity law\\" refers to the fact that the Hilbert symbols of local fields appear in Hilbert's reciprocity law for the power residue symbol. The definitions of the Hilbert symbol are usually rather roundabout and can be hard to use directly in explicit examples, and the explicit reciprocity laws give more explicit expressions for the Hilbert symbol that are sometimes easier to use. There are also several explicit reciprocity laws for various generalizations of the Hilbert symbol to higher local fields, p-divisible groups, and so on. History gave an explicit formula for the Hilbert symbol (Œ±,Œ≤) in the case of odd prime powers, for some special values of Œ± and Œ≤ when the field is the (cyclotomic) extension of the p-adic numbers by a pnth root of unity. extended the formula of Artin and Hasse to more cases of Œ± and Œ≤, and and extended Iwasawa's work to Lubin‚ÄìTate extensions of local fields. gave an explicit formula for the Hilbert symbol for odd prime powers for general local fields. His formula was rather complicated which made it hard to use, and and found a simpler formula. simplified Vostokov's work and extended it to the case of even prime powers. Examples For archimedean local fields or in the unramified case the Hilbert symbol is easy to write down explicitly. The main problem is to evaluate it in the ramified case. =Archimedean fields= Over the complex numbers (a, b) is always 1. Over the reals, the Hilbert symbol of odd degree is trivial, and the Hilbert symbol of even degree is given by (a, b)‚àû is +1 if at least one of a or b is positive, and ‚àí1 if both are negative. =Unramified case: the tame Hilbert symbol= In the unramified case, when the order of the Hilbert symbol is coprime to the residue characteristic of the local field, the tame Hilbert symbol is given byNeukirch (1999) p.335 : (a,b) = \\\\omega((-1)^{\\\\operatorname{ord}(a)\\\\operatorname{ord}(b)}b^{\\\\operatorname{ord}(a)}/a^{\\\\operatorname{ord}(b)})^{(q-1)/n} where œâ(a) is the (q ‚Äì 1)-th root of unity congruent to a and ord(a) is the value of the valuation of the local field, and n is the degree of the Hilbert symbol, and q is the order of the residue class field. The number n divides q ‚Äì 1 because the local field contains the nth roots of unity by assumption. As a special case, over the p-adics with p odd, writing a = p^\\\\alpha u and b = p^\\\\beta v, where u and v are integers coprime to p, we have for the quadratic Hilbert symbol :(a,b)_p = (-1)^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\varepsilon(p)} \\\\left(\\\\frac{u}{p}\\\\right)^\\\\beta \\\\left(\\\\frac{v}{p}\\\\right)^\\\\alpha, where \\\\varepsilon(p) = (p-1)/2 and the expression involves two Legendre symbols. =Ramified case= The simplest example of a Hilbert symbol in the ramified case is the quadratic Hilbert symbol over the 2-adic integers. Over the 2-adics, again writing a = 2^\\\\alpha u and b = 2^\\\\beta v, where u and v are odd numbers, we have for the quadratic Hilbert symbol :(a,b)_2 = (-1)^{\\\\epsilon(u)\\\\epsilon(v) + \\\\alpha\\\\omega(v) + \\\\beta\\\\omega(u)}, where \\\\omega(x) = (x^2-1)/8 and \\\\epsilon(x) = (x - 1)/2.

It is a product of the occupation of the Kosovo province by the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia through 1999, then expanded when the Republic of Kosovo was under UNMIK and KFOR control, and now how it has evolved since the unilateral declaration of independence on February 17, 2008. It consists of the former civil society organizations from before the 1999 conflict, the local NGOs that came about post conflict, and the international NGOs that have either dispersed money or opened local branches within Kosovo. It has a majority ethnic Albanian population, while having a minority Serbian, Roma, Ashkali, Egyptian, Macedonian, Montenegrin, and Croatian population. Prior to 2008, the government functions were administered by UNMIK and it was protected by KFOR. UNMIK and KFOR started their missions in 1999 after the NATO-led bombing of Yugoslavia and Serbian positions.  History of Modern Kosovo = Kosovo under Yugoslavia = The province of Kosovo was a part of Yugoslavia since its creation in 1943. After the 1974 Yugoslavian constitution, it was made an autonomous province that had status similar to the other Yugoslavian republics without giving it full rights. This lasted until Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá came into power in 1988, when he changed the legal status of the province and started a campaign to purge Albanians from the government and education system. The response was the creation of parallel societies in Kosovo, one controlled from Belgrade and one created by the local Albanian population. A few of these organizations still exist, but all were focused on providing basic services, such as education and healthcare. = Civil society directly before the war = This period of time is characterized by a legal environment that severely restricted the amount of NGOs and their effectiveness. In addition to the legal constrictions, there were also security concerns that limited the number of NGOs.http://www.cso- ks.org/?page=2,16 The Mother Teresa Society was one such organization that provided health care services;http://www.nenatereze.org/ The Council for the Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms collected and recorded information about human rights violations.http://uk.oneworld.net/contact/company/view/360 These NGOs lasted through the war and are still active in the community to date. = Civil society directly after the war = This period is characterized by the increased effectiveness of NGOs due to changes in the legal and security situation in Kosovo. The focus of the NGOs was on reconstruction, of infrastructure and residences, and humanitarian aid. Directly after the war, there was a large surge in international NGOs and money donated into the post- conflict area. After the NATO-led intervention and the signing of Regulation 1999/22 http://d4d-ks.org/about-us/?lang=en on May 9, 2000, the legal and security situation surrounding NGOs vastly improved. This allowed the international NGOs that had rushed into the country to operate with local counterparts; it also permitted the establishment and regulation of Kosovo- based NGOs.http://www.cso-ks.org/?page=2,16 = Civil society since 2008 = With the 5th anniversary of Kosovo, the focus of the civil society in Kosovo has shifted from reconstruction to governance and nation building. There has also been a shift in focus towards the protection of minority rights, specifically women, Roma, and Serbs. As Kosovo has moved past the initial reconstruction phase, there has also been a decrease in the amount of available funds and donors. It is estimated that there are only approximately 500 \\"active\\" NGOs, from the 4882 registered;http://www.unmikonline.org/regulations/1999/re99_22.pdf the others have been deemed either dormant or do not have the capacity to have any sort of meaningful effect on the country.  Civil society in Kosovo = Who = The civil society of Kosovo is generally made up of ethnic Albanians. After the NATO-led intervention, the influx of international NGOs changed the demographics of the civil society. There were a large amount of internationals from NATO member countries especially, that were based in Kosovo. Since the declaration of independence, there has been a shift to include the minorities into the process of building a democratic society. Due to the Republic of Kosovo's young population and high unemployment rates, there have been few instances of a shortage in engaging with the local population. However, NGOs cannot sustain large numbers of employees, most have between three and five employees and very few have more than 10, so while there are plenty, they are unable to provide employment for large portions of the population. = What = The civil society in the 1990s was focused on education, health care, women's rights, and the recording of human rights violations. Post-conflict Kosovo civil society was again focused on health care, women's rights, community development, and human rights; there were additional focuses on reconstruction of infrastructure and residences and humanitarian aid. Since the declaration of independence, the focus has been on the legal system, especially the judiciary and rule of law, community development, and good governance. Majority of the NGOs are focused on transparency in both the legal system and governance. = Typeshttp://www.usig.org/countryinfo/kosovo.asp#Types = Kosovo recognizes two types of domestic organization, associations and foundations. Both organizations can apply for Public Beneficiary Status, though both types are still responsible for VAT, with minor exceptions.  Associations  An association is a membership organization established by at least three domestic or foreign legal or natural persons. At least one member must reside in the Republic of Kosovo.  Foundations  A foundation is an organization without members, whose main function is to manage property or assets. It would be created by at least one legal or natural, foreign or domestic person. It can be created by a will. There has to be at least one agent who has residence in Kosovo. = Impact on development = The NGOs have been the major agents of change throughout Kosovo since before the war. They were able to provide basic services during the 1990s and help UNMIK rebuild the country after the 1999 conflict. According to UNDP's Human Development Report in 2008, every fourth Kosovar family has had their life impacted by a civil society activity and that there are more people benefiting from the system than those who are participating in the system. This latter aspect is seen more with other minorities and seen least among Kosovar-Serbs, the report states; however it does mention that Kosovar Serbs answered \\"don't know\\" when surveyed, so there could be confusion about the benefits and if they are receiving more than they know. The report also states that assistance with housing is the most common form of benefit, followed by infrastructure, education, and health care respectively. The structure of the civil society has affected the impact tremendously. There are, generally, strong organizational features of the civil society of Kosovo. However, there are areas of improvement, especially in the implementation aspect. It also states that while democratization and transparency are emphasized in internal documents and memorandums, it does not consistently translate into practice.http://civilsocietyindex.wordpress.com/2010/10/14/a-civil-society- success-story-from-kosovo/ = Funding = There are only five local grant making organizations, so a vast majority of the money has been from international donors. 86% of that money comes from United States donors while the other 14% comes from the European Union. There has been little movement towards fundraising from local businesses, due to a lack of need and tax policies that do not encourage donation.http://www.unmikonline.org/regulations/1999/re99_22.pdf  Civil society‚Äôs relationship with the government of Kosovo  Since 1999, NGOs have had to deal with a two-tiered system of government. They were regulated by the PISG and UNMIK. This has created problems, as UNMIK has been unresponsive to local level civil society activities compounded by the seeming distrust between civil society and PISG. Since 2002, the international community has been reducing the amount of money flowing into Kosovo to ensure that the PISG and NGOs would be forced to work together. However, this has not happened to a large extent. Only with international pressure does the PISG really consult with NGOs on the formation of new laws and regulations, with the notable exception of the National Action Plan for Gender Equality between politicians and women's civil society organizations. This happened over 10 weeks in 2003. Normal interactions between the government and NGOs are done through personal contacts. There are no institutional mechanisms in place to facilitate or require cooperation between the two entities. It has been speculated that the PISG still has views of the civil society as a supportive role from the pre- war era, while also viewing NGOs as competitors for the ever-shrinking international monetary fund. The reverse is the traditional Kosovar suspicion of government authorities. This cycle has impaired the process of state building, reconstruction, and development.  Civil society‚Äôs coordination in Kosovo  Majority of the funding for NGOs is project-based and generally has individual donating bodies. There is still a good amount of money that comes from UNDP, EULEX, and OSCE. UNDP focuses on projects and proposals that will affect the development of Kosovo, from infrastructure to education. EULEX focuses on projects and proposals that will increase the effectiveness of rule of law in Kosovo. OSCE works with elections and ethnic relations. They try and increase government accountability, transparency, and good governance.

It is made of sheep and cow milk and usually added to salads and main dishes, pitas, served with bread or eaten alone. The hallmarks of the cheese are its saltiness, and the fact that it is a treat for any time of the day or year.  History  The tradition of producing ≈†ar cheese has been passed on to generations for centuries. By the 1890s, the cheese became popular; the Serbian newspaper Carigradski glasnik of 28 July 1901 said that the cheese had overwhelmed the neighbouring markets because of its yellow fatty look and taste which had not been seen in other cheeses. Traditionally, ≈†ar cheese was produced on sheep milk. Another reason why sheep milk was usually used was because cows were not able to climb the highland and reach the favorite grass and herbs which give ≈†ar cheese its main characteristics. It is known that the main herb which impacts the aroma and taste of ≈†ar cheese is dill, which is very common in the highlands over altitude. After the people of the ≈†ar region had begun to use cow milk for the cheese, they started to collect the dill herb for its use as an external ingredient during the production process, with the aim to preserve the original characteristics of the cheese. Centuries ago, there were vast numbers of sheep in the region, up to 100,000; today this number has fallen to 5,000. The ≈†ar cheese is different because the region is naturally rich in unique herbs and aromatic plants which results in a much richer, better-tasting milk. Even though the cheese is popular in its solid form, there is also a soft version of it. Either solid or soft, for decades the cheese was handmade at old wooden shepherds‚Äô huts or in the homes of mountain village folks. Lately however, companies have launched industrial production lines of this product.  Production  Production/compression The cheese is traditionally made in Gora, Opolje and ≈†trpce. According to centuries-old recipes, ≈†ar cheese is mostly made from sheep and cow milk, and it is the kind of milk which determines the cheese‚Äôs fat content. The production process evolved from a traditional to a more modern way of production during the years. This happened because of two major reasons, which are: *Prevention of diseases ‚Äì Pasteurization process *Industrial production of complementary ingredients In the traditional way of production sheep milk was retained in its original temperature and not pasteurized. Later, in the more modern way the milk was pasteurized before used for cheese production. After pasteurization, the milk gets a dose of yeast which needs which is required for the fermentation process. Again, in the traditional method this yeast was taken from sheep gallstone whereas nowadays it is bought ready to use. After fermentation, the milk is poured into a diaper and compressed to release the liquid Whey remains of the fermentation process. The milk (or pre-cheese) stays in the diaper until it gains a strong and solid state and also starts to change its color from white to light yellow. After that, the cheese is taken out and stays for a few days on racks, in closed door places with low temperature. Finally, it is broken down in pieces (by hand), salted water with Dill is prepared and both are stacked into plastic jars for shipping. An interesting fact is that even the type of wood used in constructing the racks affects the aroma and quality of the cheese. For example, one type of wood which is known to be neutral, doesn't impact the aroma of the cheese and is used most to construct those racks is called Pinus peuce. Production/drying Total production of ≈†ar cheese is about 25 tones per year which is mainly produced in the region of Draga≈° from sheep and cow milk. Main characteristics related to ≈†ar cheese is availability during all year, quality, saltiness and equal presentation in all regions of Kosovo. While mostly produced in private households, the past decade has seen the rise of industrial ≈†ar cheese manufacturers. The majority of these entrepreneurs operate in and around Prizren, such as ABI Industry, a fruit and vegetable processing company which also makes this popular cheese. There is no significant difference between the traditional and industrial method of ≈†ar cheese production. The industrial version is made from pasteurized milk which is then fermented. Traditionally prepared cheese cannot be eaten until it has thoroughly absorbed the salt and has ripened, while industrially produced cheese is sent to the market after two weeks and can be eaten immediately. Veterans in industrial ≈†ar cheese production are the above mentioned ABI and another Prizren factory ‚Äì Sharri ‚Äì which has been in this business for a decade. ≈†ar cheese is mostly sold across the region of the Western Balkans. However, since people from Kosovo live and work in Western Europe ‚Äì for example in Germany and Switzerland ‚Äì cheese manufacturers are visiting food fairs in these countries, hoping to enter the Western European markets.  Flavors  There are two main variants of ≈†ar cheese: Traditional (Hard) and Soft. The main difference between the two is its state, although saltiness and smell can also vary. The soft variant has only later appeared whereas the traditional type has been produced in the same way since the beginning and is also the preferred flavor of the two. Different kinds of cheese similar to ≈†ar cheese are White cheese and Cypriot Halloumi.  Consumption  The consumption of ≈†ar cheese is dominant in Prizren, Ferizaj, and Prishtina even though it is consumed as well in other regions. Information shows that the traditional kind of ≈†ar cheese is bought more than the soft variety because of consumers‚Äô preference of hard over soft ≈†ar cheese. The most bought brand of ≈†ar cheese in Kosovo is called ‚ÄúSharri‚Äù. Quantities of ≈†ar cheese consumed per month vary from 2-3 to 10 kg. ≈†ar cheese is also popular among restaurants with approximately 43,000 kg consumed per year. Usually original ≈†ar cheese is sold in wooden buckets or plastic buckets in bigger quantities making the product specific. Price of sheep ≈†ar cheese might be between 5 and 7 Euro per kilogram while for cow ≈†ar cheese is around 4 Euros per kilogram. Usually regular consumers purchase higher quantities in wooden and plastic buckets from 5 to 20 kilograms The reason of the difference in price between sheep and cow ≈†ar cheese is the higher quality which is achieved by a higher percentage of fat in sheep milk. This makes the ≈†ar cheese produced by sheep milk the preferred flavor also because in the original days there was only sheep milk used.

The central source of law that is recognized as authoritative is codifications in a constitution or statute passed by legislature, to amend a code. This system of Kosovo has experienced several changes throughout the years and is currently a system that includes prominent bodies and branches that help Kosovo enact adequate laws and conduct proper legal procedures.  Historical context  Under the 1974 constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY), Kosovo was an ‚Äúautonomous province‚Äù within the SFRY and, as such, enjoyed substantial rights. As an autonomous province in the SFRY, Kosovo had a parliament, government, judiciary, constitutional court and a national bank. In March 1989, following the rise to power of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, Kosovo's autonomy was reverted to pre-1974 status enabling Serbia's federal authorities to assume full control over the territory. Shortly thereafter, the newly installed leadership dismissed most Kosovo Albanians from their public positions, including the judiciary. Following the disintegration of SFRY, the aforementioned constitutional changes were sanctioned into law by the 1992 constitution of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which was constituted of Serbia and Montenegro.Wolf Theiss The Legal Guide to Kosovo, 2nd edition, March 2009 The applicable law in Kosovo stems from different sources with the following order of precedence: 1\\\\. Laws passed by the Kosovo Assembly after the constitution came into force in June 2008 2\\\\. UNMIK Regulations (with supporting Assembly laws) passed between June 1999 and June 2008 3\\\\. Laws dated prior to 22 March 1989 4\\\\. Laws dated between 22 March 1989 and 10 June 1999 which are not discriminatory. = Postwar period and legal transition = Following the end of the war in June 1999 Kosovo was placed under an international protectorate, pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, and was administered by United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), while NATO based Kosovo Force (KFOR)provided for overall security.  UNMIK Regulation and supervision of the legal system  In accordance with UNSC Resolution 1244, UNMIK assumed full competencies in the legislative,executive and judicial branches of government that were exercised by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG). In order to fill the legislative gap created during the decade of Milosevic's rule, UNMIK enacted laws in the form of executive decrees, commonly referred to as ‚ÄúUNMIK Regulations‚Äù. UNMIK regulations were intended to complement, and govern the precedence of, different legal instruments enacted in the past. Indeed, while the bulk of Kosovo legislation remained relevant, a number of laws enacted during Milosevic's rule, which introduced discriminatory provisions against the Kosovo Albanian community, were repealed. Consequently, UNMIK authorized the application of the domestic law as it was in effect before 22 March 1999(before the abolishment of Kosovo's autonomy) and excluded the laws enacted between 1989 and 1999, except in cases when these legal instruments were not discriminatory and were needed to fill a legal vacuum. During its mandate, UNMIK progressively developed a comprehensive modern legal framework, which culminated with the enactment of the Constitutional Framework of Kosovo, on the basis of which, the people of Kosovo were able to democratically elect their representatives in the local and central level. In 2000, UNMIK established an emergency justice system exclusively composed of local judges and prosecutors, who were subsequently joined by a limited number of international judges and prosecutors, who were responsible for serious and sensitive crimes. While, in the executive and legislative branches of government, UNMIK gradually transferred its competencies to Kosovo authorities, UNMIK retained executive control over the judiciary until Kosovo's independence. Although following the entry into effect of Kosovo constitution in 2008, UNMIK's role became largely redundant; UNMIK is still present in Kosovo and continues to facilitate Kosovo's relations with countries that have not formally recognized its independence in general and Serbia in specific.  Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo  The Republic of Kosovo was declared independent on 17 February 2008. In April 2008 the Assembly of the Republic of Kosovo adopted the new constitution which has entered into force on 15 June 2008.The Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo (the ‚ÄúConstitution‚Äù) defines the Republic of Kosovo as an independent, sovereign, democratic, unique and indivisible state whose sovereignty stems from the people. The Constitution incorporates the Ahtisaari Plan as an integral part of the Kosovo constitutional order requiring all authorities in the Republic of Kosovo to abide by the Ahtisaari Plan and take all necessary action for its implementation. Kosovo's constitution is based on the Comprehensive Proposal for a Status Settlement for Kosovo, submitted by United Nations Special Envoy for the resolution of Kosovo's status (the \\"Ahtisaari Plan\\"), which provides for supervised independence, overseen by two international institutions, namely European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) and the International Civilian Office (ICO).Robert Muharremi,The European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) from the Perspective of Kosovo Constitutional Law, 2010, Page 362 The Ahtisaari Plan provides a number of overriding protections for Kosovo's minorities and authorizes EULEX to assist Kosovo authorities in the rule of law area, with a particular focus on police, judiciary, and customs. In this respect, EULEX retains limited executive powers, in particular, to investigate, prosecute and adjudicate serious and sensitive crimes in cooperation with the Kosovo justice institutions. ICO, on the other hand, is responsible for supervising the implementation of the Ahtisaari Plan. This very Constitution includes a justice system, assembly, government, the president and constitutional court as an integral part of its chapters and articles. Justice system is foreseen under Chapter VII respectively Articles 102 - 111, Assembly's functions and competencies are mentioned in the Articles 63 - 82, while Government and President's duties are found under Articles 83 - 101. Constitutional Court of Kosovo = Constitutional Court = The Constitutional Court of the Republic of Kosovo was established in January 2009. Its mission is guaranteed with the Articles 112 - 118 of the Constitution. With its authority to review legislation and individual complaints of rights violations, the Court is the ultimate check on legislative and executive power in Kosovo and the final arbiter of the meaning of constitutional provisions enshrining human rights and freedoms. The Constitutional Court is the final authority for the interpretation of the Constitution and the compliance of laws with the Constitution. The legal basis for the establishment of the Constitutional Court derived directly from the Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo, adopted in June 2008. This Constitution, following the declaration of independence, enshrined all the Ahtisaari provisions relating to the Constitutional Court and broadened the Court's jurisdiction to encompass certain specified claims brought by the Assembly, the President of Kosovo, the government and the Ombudsperson. The Constitution also included the right of regular courts to refer questions of constitutional compatibility of law to the Court when raised in a judicial proceeding.Nicolas Mansfield, Creating A Constitutional Court: Lessons From Kosovo, 2013, Page 2 The Court has nine Judges, each with a mandate of six years. These Judges are under the supervision of the Court President, a position that is currently held by Enver Hasani.  Overview of the legal drafting process  The Republic of Kosovo is a democracy working under the Rule of Law, respect for its Constitution and laws, and the recognition of international law. The production of laws has grown considerably, and basic laws essential to the operation of the justice system have been adopted. As provided in the Law on Legislative Initiatives, laws in Kosovo are initiated either by the President,Law on Legislative Initiatives; Art.7 the Government,Law on Legislative Initiatives; Art.9 members of the AssemblyLaw on Legislative Initiatives; Art.8 or initiatives of 10, 000 citizens.Law on Legislative Initiatives; Art.16 The vast majority of laws originate with the Executive Branch of the Government, where Ministries are responsible for proposing legislation as well as overseeing drafts and amendments of primary and secondary laws. Members of the Assembly can propose amendments to legislation by submitting a motion to the Assembly Table and the government for its opinion. Ministry drafts are sent to the Office of Legal Support Services (OLSS) within the Prime Ministers Office (PMO). The laws undergo a second tier of review at the Government level, from the OLSS, Ministry of Finance (MoF)and Agency for European Integration (AEI). After their review and approval the law is sent to the Coordinating Group of the Government and finally proceeds to the Assembly for review and adoption. Law drafting and approval process Laws most often originate at the Ministries, which are responsible for both drafting laws and amending new laws. Once the Minister approves the draft law, it is sent to the Prime Ministers Office and Office of Legal Support Services. OLSS is responsible for coordination and review of all draft laws drafted by the government. Once the OLSS reviews the law, a request is submitted to the Permanent Secretary of the PMO to establish a working group at the government level. After the government working group completes its review the, law is sent to the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MoEF) and Ministry for European Integration (MEI), before it will make its final rounds at the Assembly. The MOEF reviews the financial and budgetary implications of the law, while the MEI evaluates if the law is compatible with the EU legislation. Upon their approval of the law, the draft is sent to the PS of the PMO to be included on the agenda of the Government Coordinating Group for a final review. This is also the final step in the legal drafting process within the Government. Draft law is then forwarded to the Kosovo Assembly for their review.Arsim Bajrami, Teoria dhe Praktika Parlamentare, Flaka, 2002, Pages 134-167 The law is afterwards registered with the Table Office at the Assembly. After registration, the law undergoes a ‚Äúfirst hearing.‚Äù After the hearing, the law is reviewed by the respective functional Committees, which propose amendments and send it back for the second reading. A law can go through three readings in the Assembly. After a law is approved by the Assembly it is sent to the President who can sign it or return it within 8 days to the Assembly for revision. The law comes into effect once it is signed, and promulgated by the President 15 days after the publication in the Official Gazette. Kosovo Legal Drafting Process Overview * Legislative drafting at the executive branch of the government ‚Äì the first tier The Government Cabinet comprising the Prime Minister and all other Ministers approve the Annual Legislation Plan. Each Ministry is responsible to initiate and oversee drafts of or amendments to the laws within their area of responsibility. The Permanent Secretary (PS) and the Head of the Legal Office lead and oversee the legal drafting process. Draft law is reviewed and subsequently approved by the Minister and the PS. The approved Law is sent to the Office of Legal Support Service (OLSS) within the Prime Minister's Office (PMO). * Legislative drafting at the executive branch of the government ‚Äì the second tier The OLSS reviews and subsequently approves the law, and requests the PS of the PMO to establish a Government Working Group to review the law. The Government Working GroupLaw on Legislative Initiatives, Art.21.4 reviews the law and sends it further. The modified law is reviewed by the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the Ministry for European Integration. After their review the law is first provided to the PS of the PMO and subsequently to the Government Coordinating Group, which is composed of all the Ministries and the Prime Minister. Legislative Drafting at the Executive Branch * Legislative drafting at the Assembly After the law has been approved by the Government, it is submitted to the Table Office of the Assembly, for registration. Registration of the law with the Assembly allows the law to be placed on the Assembly's agenda. The Assembly reviews the law and may approve it in the first hearing. Following the first hearing the law is sent to the Functional Committee and the Budget and Legislative Committee. A Functional Committee is one of the Assembly Committees depending on the sector the law is addressing. The Rules of Assembly enable all the Assembly Committees to hold public hearings with experts, public organizations and interest group representatives. Most of the laws are adopted after the second reading, only in rare occasions when the law fails to be adopted after its second reading it is sent to the Assembly for a third reading. Legislative Drafting at the Assembly * The President Upon approval, the Assembly sends the law to the President for promulgation and the President has 8 days to promulgate the law or return it to the Assembly for reconsideration. The law may be returned to the Assembly for reconsideration if the President deems it to be violating of the legitimate interests of the Republic of Kosovo or one of the communities living therein.  Judicial and Prosecutorial system  European Union Law Mission in Kosovo  EULEX is an integrated European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo operating in the fields of justice, police and customs. In April 2009, EULEX became fully operational. The EU Joint Action of February 2008 and Council Decision of June 2010 and June 2012 provide the legal basis for the Mission. EULEX works within the framework of UN Security Council Resolution 1244. The Mission assists the Kosovo authorities, judicial authorities and law enforcement agencies in their progress towards sustainability and accountability. The Mission, in full co-operation with the European Commission Assistance Programmes, implements its mandate through monitoring, mentoring and advising. The Mission retains some executive responsibilities in areas such as organised crime, war crimes and serious financial crime. EULEX Justice staff are active in all Kosovo Courts and at all instances. There are more than 1,500 EULEX Police officers deployed throughout Kosovo. EULEX Customs has 6 mobile teams which criss-cross Kosovo to monitor, mentor and advice their local counterparts. The Mission is divided into two 'divisions': * the 'Executive Division' and * the 'Strengthening Division'. The Executive Division investigates, prosecutes and adjudicates sensitive cases using its executive powers. The Strengthening Division monitors, mentors, and advises local counterparts in the police, justice and customs fields.

Most of the media survive from advertising and subscriptions. Kosovo's Constitution and laws provide for freedom of expression and press freedom. Yet, these are often at stake due to political and economic interferences, fostered by media ownership concentration.Freedom House, Kosovo 2015 Press Freedom report History In 2016, Reporters Without Borders ranked Kosovo in 90th place in its World Press Freedom Index, down three places from 2015 when it was in 87th place. In 2013, Kosovo was ranked in 85th place, below the average of the Western Balkan and far away from the countries of European Union. This was a slight progress from the 86th place of 2012. Legislative framework The legal framework of Kosovo is deemed relatively good. The Constitution of Kosovo protects freedom of expression and media freedom. Defamation and libel are decriminalised, but author, editor, and publisher may be liable for damages. The Criminal Code regulates hate speech. There is no special protection for state officials. Before going to court, the person seeking damages has to try with the publisher or with the appropriate regulatory body. A negative note is that journalists may face civil proceedings for defamation without support by their media outlets. Also, in defamation and insult cases the burden of proof is on the defendant, namely the journalist. Censorship is forbidden, except in the cases of provocation of violence and discrimination. A law on the protection of journalistic sources was passed in 2013 by the Kosovo parliament, based on Belgian standards, deemed among the most advanced in Europe.Elda Brogi, Alina Dobreva, and Pier Luigi Parcu, \\"Freedom of Media in the Western Balkans\\", study for the European Parliament's Subcommittee on Human Rights, October 2014, EXPO/B/DROI/2013/16 The 2010 Law on Access to Public Documents Law on Access to Public Documents, Republic of Kosovo guarantees access to information to official documents maintained, drawn or received by the public institutions. Applicants must submit a written request for the information that they wish to access. Each ministry has an official that is tasked with dealing with access requests, though implementation is uneven and overloaded courts are not a viable avenue for redress. Online content is not regulated by law in Kosovo, besides generally applicable norms. The 2013 Code of the Press Council of Kosovo includes guidelines for online journalism, e.g. on responsibility for monitoring and control over published materials.Kosovo Press Council (2012), Guidelines of Code of Conduct. Pristina: Kosovo Press Council Kosovo media are free to enter the market freely, although the licensing system - and the politicisation of the Independent Media Commission (IMC) may be a hurdle. There remain concerns about hate speech and defamation in the media. In September 2013, three persons were indicted for hate speech after protests against the Kosovo 2.0 print magazine issue entitled \\"Sex\\", which included content addressing LGBT issues. The main issue with Kosovo's legislation, rather than its broad alignment with EU standards, is its uneven implementation, due to the lack of experience of the policy and judiciary and the challenges of interpreting a fragmented anc growing corpus of laws. = Status and self-regulation of journalists = A definition of journalist was provided in the 2013 Law on the Protection of Sources. It defines a journalist as \\"each natural or legal person, who is engaged regularly or professionally to contribute directly in the gathering, editing, production and dissemination of information to the public through the media\\". The Association of Professional Journalists records around 20 cases annually of intimidation or threats against journalists, although physical threats violent attacks have not been recorded. Job security for journalists is not guaranteed, and cases of breach of contracts are often not reported to the authorities or to the public for fear of losing the job. Freedom House concluded in 2015 that \\"journalists have few professional rights, earn low wages, and often work without contracts, leaving them vulnerable to corruption and prone to self- censorship\\" Two codes of ethics regulate the profession: the Kosovo Press Council's 2005 Code of Ethics, and the Independent Media Commission's 2010 Code of Ethics. Yet, the journalists' knowledge of media legislation is rather low. Investigative journalism is mostly lacking, as journalists end up reporting on protocol news, and no media has dedicated lawyers. Journalists and editors are exempted from requirements to testify, according to the 2013 Criminal Procedure Code. They also have the right not to reveal their sources, except if necessary to prevent serious threats possibly leading to death, according to the 2013 Law on the Protection of Sources. The Kosovo Press Council (KPC) is the self-regulatory body of the press, composed of 18 members from print and online media. It deals with around 100 claims per year, and its decisions are respected and published - though not self-executive. It is not yet financially sustainable and relies on foreign donors. It also has to face the issue of adjudicating on online media, particularly copyright and privacy violations, and hate speech. Self-censorship is on the rise, due to the \\"permeability of editorial independence in the face of advertisers, political pressure through the close links between media owners and politicians and the global dwindling media revenues, particularly in the written press\\", according to the Kosovo NGO INDEPINDEP Institute for Development Policy (2013), The State of Media in Kosovo, 2012. Analysis . Although several journalists' associations exist, there is no officially recognised professional trade union. In May 2016, a Freedom of Expression, Media and Information Freedom of Expression, Media and Information in Kosovo, √áohu!, Kosovo 2.0 and KPC report was published by √áohu!, Kosovo 2.0 and KPC which used the European Council's 27 Indicators for Media in a Democracy. It found that \\"While some progress has been made over the years, overall challenges remain with regard to freedom of expression and information, the legislative and regulatory framework, and independence, to ensure freedom of expression, information and media.\\" Media outlets According to IREX there were 92 radio stations and 22 television stations in Kosovo in 2012. Media ownership is not regulated by law, but it was deemed \\"transparent\\" by the INDEP institute in 2012. Private print and broadcast media have to register with the Kosovo Business Registration Agency and disclose their ownership structure. The Independent Media Commission requires media companies to send it annual ownership reports and to disclose the same information with tax authorities. Anyway, media that are not registered as companies have no such legal requirement. Although ownership transparency rules are effective, the real backers of several print media remain opaque. Media ownership is mainly local, as no foreign investor operates on the market. Media ownership concentration is very strong, according to the 2014 European Commission progress report. Commercial media are mostly funded through advertisement revenues. Dependence on big advertisers - particularly the public or state-owned ones - often leads media to self-censorship when their interests are at stake. The state only provides small funding for minority media. In the analysis of advertising market in the Republic of Kosovo by Independent Media Commission 44% of the budget of public companies goes for advertisements in national televisions, 10% in local televisions, 8% in national radios, 9% in local radios, 11% for daily newspapers and 18% for other media. Kosovo lacks strong private advertisers, thus leaving private advertisers dependent on foreign donors. Most media outlets remain financially unsustainable, and operate only thanks to political or business supporters. The financial crisis hit hard on Kosovo media, especially the independent ones, with two daily newspapers closed in 2012, resulting in job losses and lack of job security for journalists.IREX (2013b), Europe & Eurasia. Media Sustainability Index 2013: Kosovo . Pristina. Yet, media close to political interests seem to withstand the crisis better and to secure advertisement funds more easily. =Public service broadcaster= The public service broadcaster is Radio Television of Kosovo, RTK, regulated by the Law on Public Broadcasting. Its financing was originally guaranteed by a license fee paid over electricity bill, until the Constitutional Court declared that it was not due and shifted RTK's budget over state subsidy (0.7% of Kosovo's budget). The change raised concerns for the preservation of RTK's independence. The legal requirement for RTK to plan an end to the transitional state budget funding has not been enacted. RTK has been criticised for lack of investigative journalism and political bias, e.g. in the extensive coverage of the ruling political party (including the annual meeting of the ruling Kosovo Democratic Party) as opposed to the short and misleading coverage of opposition Vetvendosje 2012 protests, which was deemed \\"a major signal of state financing putting the editorial independence of public television at risk\\" (IREX, 2013b). Moreover, RTK coverage only reaches 62.7% of Kosovo's territoryIndependent Media Commission of Kosovo (2013), Annual Report for 2012 RTK Board members are elected by the Parliament by majority vote, thus entrusting their appointment to the majority parties. Political pressures aside, RTK maintains an untapped potential thanks to good equipment and professional editors and journalists. =Print media= In Kosovo there are several operating newspapers. They include: * The Kosovo Spectator ('Independent') - English language *Revista Kosovarja is a magazine published in Kosovo. It was founded on October 24, 1971 *Kosova Press ('Independent News Agency KosovaPress') is first News Agency on Kosovo. The news agency Kosova Press was established on January 4, 1999. Since that time, it has published information in these languages: Albanian, English, German and French. It currently publishes in Albanian and English. * Koha Ditore ('Daily Time'), the only newspaper published before 1999, remains the leading daily newspaper. Its founder and owner Veton Surroi founded the Reformist Party ORA (now part of LDK), and the newspaper is run by his sister Flaka Surroi. * Gazeta Express ('Express newspaper') was established in 2005 as an independent daily, financed by IPKO, Kosovo's leading private telecommunications company. In tabloid format, it is known for its distinctive editorials and op-ed's, as well as focus on investigative journalism. * Arbresh ('Portali arbresh')is a Kosovo newsportal * Infopress * Bota Sot ('World Today'). Headquartered in Zurich, it launched as the newspaper of the Kosovo diaspora in Switzerland. Its editorial line supported the Democratic Party of Albania and the Democratic League of Kosovo. *InfoKosova ('Portali InfoKosova') is a Kosovo newsportal * Bota Press ('World Press') Pro-LDK. * Epoka e Re ('The New Epoch'), established in 1999. * Kosova Sot ('Kosovo Today') independent. Claims to have the highest circulation. * Lajm ('News'), est. 2004, pro-AKR, owned by the businessman and politician Behgjet Pacolli. * Tribuna ('The Tribune') * Z√´ri ('The Voice'), owned by Blerim Shala, an analyst and journalist who also took part in the Kosovo status process negotiations *Teleshkronja Post News and Media website based in Drenas (Ex-Glogoc) owned by Teleshkronja Post news company, founded date: 26 November 2017. Express, a newspaper best known for its front page on the day when Kosovo declared independence, since March 22, 2013 exists only online. According to OSCE there are between 25.000-35.000 copies sold every day, which is a low number compared with Kosovo's population (around 2 million). =PublishingRadio broadcasting= There are six nationwide radio channels in Kosovo: Radio Kosova (part of RTK), Radio Blue Sky, Radio 21, Radio Dukagjini, and Radio K4 (the latter broadcasting in both Albanian and Serbian). There are then five regional-coverage channels (Radio BESA, 92.1 Capital FM, Radio HELIX, Radio MITROVICA, and Radio PULS - the latter in Serbian), and several local ones. As the Kosovo Media Institute pointed out in 2010, local radios have a significantly larger share of the audience in comparison with national radios ‚Äì 60.76% for local radios in comparison to 33.54% for national radio emitters (5.68% are for foreign and/or other radio stations). Likewise, there are around 30 radio stations in Kosovo that have the highest obedience in the regions where they operate =Television broadcasting= Television in Kosovo was first introduced in 1975. 92% of households in Kosovo have a television nowadays. TV remains the main source of information for most Kosovo residents. The nationwide TV broadcasters in Kosovo are Radio Television of Kosovo (RTK), with four channels; Radio Television 21 (RTV21), Kohavision (KTV) and Klan Kosova. The public service broadcaster in Kosovo is RTK, which is subsidized by the government and also receives money from advertisement. The law obliges RTK to broadcast programs in Albanian and in Serbian language too. According to IREX, a nonprofit organization, insufficient market research and data on broadcasting ratings which are considered unreliable contribute to an overall unfavorable business environment for media organizations. =CinemaTelecommunications= The fixed telephony penetration rate in Kosovo is among the lowest in Europe, with 4.48 lines per 100 inhabitants. On the other hand, mobile telephony has boomed. In 2007, PTK reported growth of subscribers from 300,000 to 800,000 in less than a year.http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNADK675.pdf In 2010, 74 percent of the population was subscribed to mobile phone services, or a total number of 1,537,164 GSM-services in Kosovo are provided currently by Vala Mobile, a subsidiary of PTK (initially using the +377 Monaco prefix), and by IPKO (Si Mobitel), a company owned by Telekom Slovenije, which has acquired the second mobile operator license in Kosovo and has started operations in late 2007 (initially using the +386 Slovenia prefix). A Kosovo-specific +383 country calling code is in the process of being established. Three virtual operators existed during the years between 2000 and 2020: D3 Mobile (owned by Dukagjini Group), Z Mobile (defunct, numbers transferred to Kosovo Telecom), Zog Mobile (defunct, owned by IPKO). =Internet= Around 84% of Kosovo residents have access to internet, which is not restricted by the authorities. In the last years web portals have become very important source of information. According to Kosovo Association of Information and Communication Technology 72.1% of households in Kosovo have access on the internet and the number of internet users is constantly growing. As IREX points out, web news portals are constantly becoming more useful and attractive, in proportion with the growing of the internet usage. Telegrafi.com is an online news portal which is visited by more than 60.000 people each day. There are also other web news portals such as Koha.net, Gazeta Express, Kosova Press, Teleshkronja Post and so on. Internet coverage is widespread but it experiences frequent outages. As of September 2010, the number of internet subscribers was 105,061 or 35.02% household penetration rate. Media organisations The Independent Media Commission regulates the range of broadcasting frequencies in the Republic of Kosovo and other related issues. In order for the media to start broadcasting they should have the license issued by Independent Media Commission. The license is renewed every seven years for radio broadcasts and every ten years for audiovisual media services. The Association of Independent Broadcast Media of Kosovo (AMPEK) represents the interests of leading commercial broadcasters in Kosovo. Their role is to protect and to promote the interests of the Kosovo's private broadcasters. Press Council of Kosovo is a self-regulatory body founded for and by the print media sector in Kosovo. Its mission is based on the convictions of the Press Code of Kosovo. PCK is established in September, 2005 with the help of OSCE Mission in Kosovo, however, the office of PCK has started its activity in December, 2005. =Regulatory authorities= Electronic media are regulated by the Independent Media Commission (IMC), established by law as an \\"independent body for regulation, management, and oversight of the broadcasting frequency spectrum\\". Yet, its composition and functioning remain under political influence. The IMC members are elected by the Kosovo Parliament, and are thus affiliated to the ruling political parties. The IMC board thus risks blocking civil servants' agenda for political reasons. The new IMC Board Chairman failed to disclose its previous activities in local government, which would have disqualified him from eligibility. Kusari, Flutura (2013), Media Freedom in Kosovo. Report Presented to the CMPF, EUI, Fiesole (Florence). Censorship and media freedom In 2016, Freedom House scored Kosovo as \\"partly free\\", with an overall score of 49 (where 0 is the best and 100 the worst). The organisation recorded the persistence of political interference, financial pressures, and high media ownership concentration. Freedom of the Press Report - Kosovo, Freedom House 2016 Minority issues are often neglected in the media, and at most limited to Kosovo Serbs. RTK started a Serbian-language cable channel RTK2 in June 2013. =Attacks and threats against journalists = Journalists in Kosovo face recurrent threats and attacks. The backlogs of judicial courts and the flaws in the judiciary (with inefficient prosecutions) lead to delayed investigations.Human Rights Watch, \\"A Difficult Profession. Media Freedom Under Attack in the Western Balkans\\". July 2015, 978-1-6231-32576 The Association of Professional Journalists records around 20 cases annually of intimidation or threats against journalists, although physical threats violent attacks have not been recorded. The Association of Professional Journalists of Kosovo (APIK) recorded 22 cases of threats and physical assaults against journalists in 2014, on the rise from the previous years; AGK documented 25 cases in the same year. Although perpetrators are known, investigations tend to lag behind. Only one case was solved in 2012-14, resulting in a low fine. HRW checked 63 claims of threats, of which only one (Life in Kosovo) had led to prosecution and finally acquittal. The Kosovo interior minister Bajram Rexhepi told HRW in 2014 that they take crimes against journalists seriously and that the police is doing a good job, shifting the blame towards prosecutors and the judiciary. He also suggested that journalists share a part of the blame, as \\"not all journalists respect the ethical code\\". The police told HRW that they do not differentiate among victims, but that cases involving vulnerable groups (journalists, children, women, minorities) are treated as priority. In 2015 AGK in cooperation with OSCE reported 27 death threats against journalists. According to data by Kosovo police the same year there were 24 cases of attacks and threats reported by journalists. In recent years several threats were received by journalists covering Islamic fundamentalism. Convictions for attacks and threats against journalists are still uncommon. *Jeta Xharra, chief editor at Life in Kosovo TV show, complained in 2009 against the major of Skenderaj for death threats. The EULEX prosecutor acted upon the police complaint only three years after. The courts then dismissed the case based on statutes of limitation. *Vehbi Kajtazi, journalist at Koha Ditore, got a death threat in 2011 from the former dean of Prizren university and adviser to the Kosovo government, after he having exposed corruption involving him. The prosecution indicted the perpetrator only in November 2013. Kajtazi reported about 15 threats to the police, finally concluding that it was useless to do so. * Journalists reporting on religious radicalism often complain of online threats. The Kosovo Police set up a cybercrime unit in late 2012. Artan Haraqija received hundreds of online threats, including death threats; the police arrested one suspect, but released him the day after and told Haraqija he had nothing to worry about. * Arbana Xharra, chief editor of Z√´ri, started receiving death threats after reporting on radical religious groups in 2012 and reported them to the police, but with no consequences. * Faton Shoshi, owner of news portal Indeksonline accused Valon Salihu, a senior official of the Kosovo Intelligence Agency (KIA) of threatening him after he published an article about the agency director. The journalist brought the case to court, but a trial scheduled for June 2015 was cancelled because of Salihu's absence. * In June 2014 a Serbian public TV reporter, covering a festival at the Gracanica monastery, was arrested for minor traffic violations and injured while manhandled in police custody. * On 22 June 2014 three journalists were attacked, and one was slightly injured, by protestors against a barricade dividing Kosovska Mitrovica and North Mitrovica (inhabited mainly by Kosovo Serbs). * On 2 July 2014 Mefail Bajqinovci, a journalist running a TV show about crime on Kohavision (KTV), received a telephone threat from an unknown person at Dubrava Prison. * The satirical TV journalist Milot Hasimja from Klan Kosova channel was stabbed several times on its workplace in November 2014. The attacker was charged with attempted murder and condemned to four years in prison. * Zekirja Shabani, APIK president and journalist for Tribuna, was attacked by the newspaper owner Sejdi Demiri in December 2014, allegedly for his trade union activities. * In June 2015 several bullets were shot against the office of KoSSev news portal. * In January 2016 Gazmend Morina, a journalist of the news portal Veriu.info, was physically attacked by a member of the municipal assembly and by another person after he criticized the management of the Trepƒça Mines in Mitrovica South. * Astrit Gashi, journalist of Blic news portal, accused Dardan Nuhiu, the director of the Financial Investigation Unit (FIU) of threatening him, after he published a leaked confidential document. * In August 2016 grenades were thrown in the courtyard of Radio Television of Kosovo (RTK) headquarters. There were damages but no injury. On 28 August 2016 a bomb was set off outside the home of Mentor Shala, the head of RTK. Both the attacks were probably done by a group opposing the cession of 80 square kilometres of territory to Montenegro. * Adem Grabovci, a politician of the Democratic Party of Kosovo, filed a lawsuit against investigative news website Insajderi, accusing it of violation of his privacy and of his constitutional rights, for publishing a story containing proof of his role in cases of alleged corruption. While the lower court dismissed the complaint, in October 2016 the Court of Appeals of Pristina overturned the decision, even giving suggestions to the plaintiff according to Reporters Without Borders. * In October 2016 Leonard Kerquki, editor-in-chief of the Gazeta Express, received death threats, insults and libel, for having directed a documentary (part of Zona Express weekly show), accusing the Kosovo Liberation Army of having committed war crimes against civilians in the name of patriotism. Prosecutions and convictions for crimes against journalists are rare. In March 2014 three men were convicted to two-years suspended sentences in a high-profile case related to a 30-people storming of the launch of a Kosovo 2.0 issue on LGBT rights and gender issues. =Political interferences= \\"Political intimidation can thrive\\" in Kosovo, the OSCE concluded in June 2014, due to the small size of the country and the dependency of media professionals on public employment. Advertising and fundings are seen as the primary avenues for direct or indirect pressures on media outlets.OSCE Mission in Kosovo, Freedom of Media and Safety of Journalists in Kosovo, June 2014 The public service broadcaster RTK is particularly vulnerable to direct and indirect political interference, often seen as \\"a mouthpiece of the government\\". Journalists that are critical of public officials are at risk of being denounced as traitors or \\"Serbian spies\\". Stories critical of government have been obstructed by editors, and some journalists have been threatened with dismissal. Non-aligned media outlets have been intimidated with tax inspections or have had their access to public information obstructed. *The Association of Journalists of Kosovo (AGK) complained about verbal threats and obstruction against journalists by government officials, business interests and media owners. * In May 2014 the AGK chairwoman resigned due to allegations of improper connections with the ruling PDK party. *In October 2014 a Koha Ditore reporter complained of threats of prosecution from EULEX officials if he had refused to hand over documents allegedly implicating EULEX in corruption activities. *Jeta Xharra complained that her TV show Life in Kosovo on the public channel RTK, airing since 2005, had its airtime cut for political reasons and was replaced by lower-league soccer games. The budget for investigative journalism on RTK had already been proposed for cuts in 2009, but this was later avoided by the Parliament. The show has not received due payments from RTK from late 2013 to November 2014 (and possibly further), endangering its financial security. \\"Public TV is exercising pressure by not paying for the programs containing our production\\", Xharra told HRW. On 26 March 2015 journalists and trade union's members Arsim Halili and Fadil Hoxha were fired from the Radio Television of Kosovo (RTK) by the general director Mentor Shala after they had publicly asked to the television to stop following a \\"political agenda\\". 60 of the broadcaster top editors and journalists confirmed the accusation of their colleagues. Reporters Without Borders expressed concern. Later 80 journalists (10% of the staff) protested in front of the television's offices. =Smear campaigns= A reporter at Life in Kosovo was subject to a 12-days smear campaign by the daily Infopress, calling her a Serbian spy and asking for her to be punished, after she reported on local politics in Skenderaj in 2009‚Äì2010. She later left journalism due to pressures. The five Infopress columnists who had threatened her were acquitted in 2013, with the court establishing that the op-eds did not constitute a threat. Media ownership=Transparency= Transparency of media ownership refers to the public availability of accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information about media ownership structures. A legal regime guaranteeing transparency of media ownership makes possible for the public as well as for media authorities to find out who effectively owns, controls and influences the media as well as media influence on political parties or state bodies. According to a study carried out within the South East European Media Observatory, the lack of transparency in media ownership and in the financial flows for the media is one of the major problem affecting the media system in Kosovo. In the 2016 progress report, the European Commission (EC) expressed worries about the lack of transparency regarding media ownership in Kosovo. The implementation of measures to provide for transparent information on media ownership is among the recommendations made by the EC for the years to come. This situation is a consequence of the existing legal vacuum in the field. The scarce available data on media ownership and finances are badly reliable. Current legislation does not address the issue of media ownership transparency and concentration. These issues were not dealt with by the first provisional media regulations adopted by UNMIK in 2000, so that de facto the issue was left to the authority of the Temporary Media Commissioner. The Independent Media Commission database usually contains the names of media owners. In some cases, only the names of contact persons are disclosed. Private media are registered to the Kosovo Business Registration Agency according to the law regulating businesses transparency. If in the case of print media, the owners are de facto largely known due to the fact that they publish information about ownership and editorial staff, and to the small size of the market and social interaction, this does not apply to electronic media which sector lacks proper regulation resulting in the complete lack of registration and of information on ownership, finances and human resources. The problem of lack of transparency of online media has further augmented with the explosion of digital media market. A 2014 study that examined ownership transparency of eight news portals found out that none of them made publicly available information on ownership, only two published the names of the editors-in-chief, two provided information on the staff working in the media, and six offered information on the address of the outlet. According to some experts, this has contributed to an environment enabling fictive online portals to be established as political propaganda tools and to exert pressure on professional media outlets. The television and broadcast sector also remains heavily problematic in terms of media ownership transparency. Media analysts have thus raised concern on who exactly owns and controls the media in Kosovo, behind the nominal owners. This situation makes possible to identify a specific ownership pattern in Kosovo media system, which takes the shape of hidden ownership and nominal owners as a cover for actual owners. Experts find this fact suspicious and alarming. =Concentration and pluralism= There are many media outlets in Kosovo but the concentration of ownership is increasing, often in a non-transparent way. This, together with direct and indirect political and financial pressures and interference, creates repercussions on journalist and editors, with overall issues for the independence of the media sector. ;Regulations and data Since current media legislation does not cover media ownership transparency and concentration limited data are available and they are mostly unreliable. There also no reliable data on audience share of radio, television and newspapers. The advertising market is also not regulated and not transparent. Market research is also underdeveloped. ;Development after 1999 Pluralistic media developed in Kosovo only after 1999. Ownership still changes often, and so does the way in which ownership influences journalism. Most of the existing media were launched or supported by international donors. E.g. USAID and the Open Society Institute (OSI) -now Open Society Foundations (OSF)- Media Program provided funding for televisions RTV21, Kohavision, newspaper Kosova Sot. OSI also supported Koha Ditore. Since they were dependent on donors' money, when the flow was reduced many media found themselves in a difficult situation. ;Models and patterns of ownership Different models of ownership emerged. One is economic ownership. Some big companies own media and use them not as business by themselves, but for the interests of pre-existing business, or even to protect them from media. Another one is political ownership. Political parties, members of political parties or individual supporting them have launched or bought media (many newspapers, and recently also television channels), and use them to gain party and political power. State advertising makes for the largest part of advertising revenue, and it has been used to support pro-government newspapers or influence editorial policies. Advocacy media are often registered as non-governmental organizations. They are most likely to be internationally funded, which allow them to work without market pressure. Recently there has been a flourishing of small independent news portals. This is a new model of ownership that adds to the pluralism, but quality is often low, and some practice copy-pasting. There is also a pattern of hidden ownership, both by political and business groups. Some private owners are family businesses. ;Advertising market The fact that the advertising market is not regulated nor transparent is cited as a reason for the lack of interest by foreign media owners Currently advertising industry is considered insufficient to fund all existing media, let alone supporting their growth. Main media owners ;Sara√ßini-Kelmendi family Af√´rdita Sara√ßini- Kelmendi, her husband Florin Kelmendi, and her brother Eugen Sara√ßini, controls Company 21, owning TV21, Radio 21 and other media outlets. ;Surroi family Flaka Surroi owns the Koha Group, after her brother Veton Surroi transmitted it to her in 2004. It includes Kohavision (KTV), Arta TV, Koha Ditore, and other outlets. ;Devolli family In 2014 it was claimed that Devolli Group, the main business supporters of the Democratic Party of Kosovo, became the owner of the 40% of Klan Kosova, but it was not possible to confirm or refute the news. ;Lluka family Ekrem Lluka \\"is the owner of the Dukagjini Group, which includes TV Dukagjini, Radio Dukagjini, Insurance Company, Slovenian-Kosovo Pension Fund, the mobile telephony business D3 Mobile, two hydro power plants in Albania, hotels, a hospital, a printing plant, a publishing house, the Tobacco import and distribution network, Birra Peja, etc.\\" His son Gent Lluka is the owner of Telegrafi.com, \\"the second ranking news portal in Kosovo and Albania\\". ;Public service broadcaster Radio Television of Kosovo (RTK) is the public service broadcaster. It offers four television channels, two radio stations and a web portal. It is funded by the state (with additional funds from advertising) and it has been accused of not being balanced.

Vehicles whose cylinder capacity was less than 50 cm3 were exempt from registration. The plates remained legal until the end of 1993, when all vehicles had to be re-registered to the West German system. Design Trabant 601 registered in East Berlin The plates' appearance remained largely constant during the 37 years in which they were issued. Black alphanumerics rendered in a condensed version of DIN 1451 were used (although other fonts have also been observed),http://www.hegis.de/ddr5.htm with the first letter indicating the bezirk (the German word for 'district') where the vehicle was registered. Between 1953 and 1974, the format of these plates was XX ##-##, where X is any letter in the range A-Z, and # is a digit between 0 and 9 - although a numerical prefix and/or suffix of '00' was disallowed. In response to the dramatic increase in the number of vehicles on East German roads, the design was revised in October 1974 to include an additional serial letter, albeit at the cost of the initial digit. The new format became: XXX #-##. Under this system, '0' was a permitted prefix digit, but the combination '0-00' was disallowed. List of district identifiers The prefixes were allocated alphabetically to each region, from North to South.

He was a Maqpon dynasty king who unified Baltistan and expanded its frontiers to Ladakh and western Tibet in the east, and in the west to the borders of Ghizar and Chitral.  Military Achievements = Anchan and Mughals= Anchan came into contact with the Mughal court. According to the Balti version, Ali Sher Khan Anchan lost his royal father as a child. His maternal uncle, the Raja of Shigar, took him to Shigar with his mother. The intention was probably to put him to death and annex the Skardu Kingdom, the boy's inheritance, to his Kingdom of Shigar. At the age of 18, with twelve faithful followers of his father, Ali Sher Khan fled to Delhi. He was noticed by the Emperor Akbar when he showed his physical prowess by killing a lion while hunting in Delhi. The Emperor gave him the command of a Moghul army to reclaim his lost kingdom. While at Delhi, he married a Moghul princess named Gul Khatoon. In 1586 A.D., when Akbar the Great conquered Kashmir, Ali Sher Khan Anchan was with him (referred to as Ali Rai by Mughal historians). = Conquest of Ladakh = It is related that Ladakhi kingdom extended up to Sermik in the West. During the reign of Ghazi Mir, the Ladakhis were driven out not only from the Kharmang valley but the entire district of Purik (Kargil) was occupied by Ali Sher Khan, the heir apparent. He is said to have garrisoned the fort at Kharbu with soldiers and appointed a ‚ÄòKharpon‚Äô or governor to administer the border area. A few years had not passed when the Raja of Laddakh, Jamyang Namgyal, attacked the principalities in the district of Purik (Kargil) annihilating the Skardu garrison at Kharbu and putting to sword a number of petty Muslim rulers in the Muslim principalities in Purik (Kargil), Ali Sher Khan Anchan, Sher Ghazi, Raja of Khaplu and Raja of Shigar left with a strong army by way of Marol and bypassing the Laddakhi army occupied Leh, the capital of Laddakh. It appears that the Balti conquest of Laddakh took place in about 1594 A.D. The Raja of Laddakh was ultimately taken prisoner. Legends show that the Balti army obsessed with success advanced as far as Purang, in the valley of Mansarwar Lake, and won the admiration of their enemies and friends. The Raja of Laddakh sued for peace and since Ali Sher Khan‚Äôs intention was not to annex Laddakh, he agreed subject to the condition that the village of Ganokh and Gagra Nullah should be ceded to Skardu and he (the Laddakhi Raja) should pay annual tribute. This tribute was paid through the Gonpa (monastery) of Lama Yuru till the Dogra conquest of Laddakh.Baltistan in History, banat gul afridi Hashmatullah records that the Head Lama of the said Gonpa had admitted before him the payment of yearly tribute to Skardu Darbar till the Dogra conquest of Laddakh. The king of Laddakh offered his daughter in marriage to Ali Sher Khan. = Conquest of Dardistan and Chitral = The incessant attacks on and plunder of villages in Roundu Baltistan, Dras, Gultari and Shingo Shigar by people from Gilgit, Chilas and Astore while he was preoccupied in the campaigns in Laddakh, forced Ali Sher Khan Anchan to march on Gilgit with an Army worthy of his glorious name. He conquered Astore, Gilgit, Hunza, Nagar and Chilas. From Gilgit he advanced to and conquered Chitral and Kafiristan. To commemorate his victory he planted a Chinar Tree (Plane Tree) at Chitral near the village of Bronshel. In Balti folk songs and stories Chitral is known by the name of Brushal and this Chinar tree is referred to as Brosho Shingial or the Chinal of Broshal-corrupted form of Bronshal. In the folk lore named after this Chinar of Brushal-Brosho Shingial, the exploits of Ali Sher Khan are enumerated and tribute is paid to the Anchan for his remarkable conquest and the boundary of his kingdom from Purang in the east to Brushal or Chitral in the West and in doing so, the Balti people have also been allowed to share the tribute. In one line the western and eastern boundaries of the Maqpon Empire have been defined ‚ÄòLeh Purang na Brushal Shingel‚Äô meaning ‚Äòfrom Leh‚Äôs Purang to Brushal‚Äôs Chinar Tree‚Äô. Tareekh-e-Baltistan Yousuf hussain abadi He started Polo at Shundur Polo Ground first time. =Conquest of Kargil = Ali Sher Khan Anchan conquered most of the principalities of Kargil and introduced Balti culture in the Kargil District.  Constructions  Anchan also took a lot interest in constructions. *WATER CHANNEL (STREAM) FROM HARGISA NULLAH TO KACHURA A water channel (stream) was constructed from Hargisa Nullah near Koshmara to the Kachura lake. It was dug on the pattern of those found in Srinagar. Shikaras (small boats) ferried between Kushmara and Kachura. This stream had the twin purpose of providing irrigational facilities to the people as well as recreation to the royal princesses. Ruins of the stream are still to be found in Giayul village. * BUND AT SATPAR LAKE. Ali Sher Khan is also credited with the construction of a dam on the Satpara Lake which irrigates Skardu. During the winter months the doors of the barrage were closed and in spring time opened according to irrigational needs. This practice is followed even to this day. * KHARFOCHO AND KHACHE KHAR The construction of the Kharfocho Fort has been attributed by Hashmatullah to Maqpon Bukha or more correctly,Tareekh-e-Jummu, Molve hashmatullah Bugha, one of his ancestors. Cunningham and Moghal historians are of the view that the fort was constructed by Ali Sher Khan. Fosco Maraini says that everything of note in Skardu was put down to the credit of Ali Sher Khan.

It starts at the time of Constantine the Great, who was born in ancient Dardania with the acceptance and spread of Christianity, and continues as a tumultuous period because of the different barbaric invasions that plague the empire at that time, be that by Goths, Avars, Slavs, etc. Kosovo was always in an interesting strategic position, being situated between the old-world East and West, at that time the eastern and western Roman empire. With the decline of the western Roman Empire, we see an intriguing development where some of the emperors of Rome are Illyrians or Dardanians. To list a few prominent ones: Justinian, Constantine, and Diocletian. They bring a breath of fresh air to the antiquated system of government of Rome and replace the capital to Constantinople, which brings forth a new surge of civilization and knowledge.Milot Berisha, Archaeological Guide of Kosovo,Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.77‚Äì78. While the Dark Age is in full swing in Europe, Kosovo and Balkans in general see a migration of new people in its territories, and even though not in peace, see a period of progression. The old knowledge of the Classics is not lost nor forgotten, and a new development in art and architecture starts. This puts Kosovo in an interesting position being that it becomes a bridge through which we see these different influences of civilization happen, whereas we see an influence of Romanesque, Byzantine, and later Ottoman styles of life, philosophy, religion and architecture. We also see during this tumultuous period the building of many fortifications to protect the population from the uncertainties of conquest from abroad.Luan P√´rzhita, Kemajl Luci, G√´zim Hoxha, Adem Bunguri, Fatmir Peja, Tomor Kastrati, Harta Arkeologjike e Kosov√´s, v√´llimi. 1, Prishtin√´, Akademia e Shkencave dhe e Arteve e Kosov√´s, 2006, Pg. 198, . Entrance of the Monastery of Gracanica. Below we will see some of the settlements and fortresses in Kosovo. Being that this is an archaeological article, we excluded the sacral monuments, but it would be interesting to study them as well, considering their age and continuous use, since the very first days of Christianity until today, through different creeds and nationalities. As an example we will take the Graƒçanica monastery which is built on top of an ancient Christian basilica, a continuation of the ancient town of Municipium Ulpiana. Settlements=Vrela= The village of Vrela is situated approximately 7 km west from the town of Istok. Archaeological excavations conducted here in 2010, unearthed remains and foundations of a church with small dimensions, typical for the early Christian period (4th‚Äì6th century AD). Close to the church, a necropolis is set that is most probably linked to the settlement sited in the upper part of the hill. Excavations carried in the church, revealed a large type of crypt grave, measuring: 2.80m in length, 1.40m in width and 1.40m in height, constructed in the shape of a semicircular arch or vault. The grave is oriented east-west and at the western side a small entry gate of 0.6m, in height, with an archway has been recorded. Nonetheless, the crypt/grave was constructed with tough stones, and what is interesting, inside the unearthed grave, intact mortal remains of a male was discovered, buried according to the Christian rites.Milot Berisha, Archaeological Guide of Kosovo,Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.79. =Mali≈°evska Banja= The village of Mali≈°evska Banja, situated southeast from the town of Mali≈°evo, on the left side of the Mirusha river shore, an archaeological site known by the toponomy 'Trojet e Vjetra' is found. This archaeological site has a character of a burial mound (tumulus) and was erected during the Iron Age, but reused during the Early Medieval period. Investigations, respectively archaeological excavations were carried out at this location in 2005, which resulted with confirmation of graves identification, constructed with stone slabs and very rich with grave goods. Among the most important findings, Early Medieval jewelry made of bronze like rings, bracelets, and necklaces with a symbol of Christian crosses were recorded and documented.Milot Berisha, Archaeological Guide of Kosovo,Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.80. =Ariljaƒça Fortress= The Ariljaƒça fortress/castle (4th‚Äì6th century AD), is situated on top of the hill known by the local toponomy as the Gradina ‚Äì Ariljaƒça, set in an erased and dominant position, west from the Ariljaƒça village. The fortress is located in an altitude of maximum 766 meters above the sea level, and is approximately sited 9 km southeast from the town of Kosovo Polje and only 2 kilometers west from Pristina International Airport \\"Adem Jashari\\". The total surface of the fortress, also counting along the circular walls/ ramparts, measures around 1.3 hectares of the inner space of the stronghold. The archaeological excavations at this site were conducted in several seasons, commencing in 2005 and were carried out systematically until 2009. Nonetheless, several conservations and consolidations of the circuit walls were done in order to preserve the remains. During the archaeological five season's works, numerous remains and foundations of sacral, profane and utilitarian buildings were discovered. In regard, the entire outer sides of the rampart with towers at the axes were unearthed, as well as a church with three naves and a Saskrity are discovered, but also two almost identical structures in a rounded shape of an unknown sacral complex has been uncovered, as well. On the other hand, vast movable archaeological material composed of; metal made working tools, jewelry, coins, bricks, glass fragments and architectural structures, all clear indications that pinpoint to the Late Antique date and especially typical for the Justinian Period. Also, at this fortress traces of prehistoric periods have been evidenced, especially emphasizing the metal periods, but it continued to exist all through antiquity and up to the Medieval Period.Milot Berisha, Archaeological Guide of Kosovo,Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.81. =Podgraƒëe Fortress= The fortress of Podgraƒëe is situated at the area of the Podgraƒëe village, positioned on a low hill of 567 meters above sea level. The fortress is located around 10 kilometers southwest of Gnjilane and below the Podgraƒëe hill flows the river of Binaƒçka Morava. The plan of the citadel of the Podgraƒëe fortress has a shape of irregular pentagonal, while, the southern wall of the central tower served as a fortifying wall for the citadel. On the highest part, remains of a watchtower are still visible, whose walls are partially preserved up to ten meters height. In regard, the tower watch is constructed in rectangularform measuring eight by eight meters. Likewise, at the corners of the ramparts, smaller dimension towers are set. In the western, northern and northeastern angles of the fortification walls, the small towers go up to four meters height. The inner space of the fortification has a total area of approximately 1.2 hectares and it is typical construction for the period of the Emperor Justinian the Great (6th century AD), respectively, the Podgraƒëe fortress takes part in the frame of the net fortifications erected in Dardania during the end of the Late Antiquity.Milot Berisha, Archaeological Guide of Kosovo,Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.82. =Korisha Fortress with The Early Christian Church= The archaeological excavations conducted in two seasons; 2002 and 2004 at the Korisha fortress located at the area known by the toponomy as the 'Gralishta' hill, revealed contours and documented the plan of an early Christian church of the 6th century AD. The Korisha early Christian church which is located inside the fortress has an apse oriented toward the east. Inside the church, traces of a cintron are constructed in the form of stairs and in the shape of trapeze. Within the altar area of the church parts of the banisters were documented. The movable archaeological material, abundant and diverse findings were recorded here, which, besides the Late Antique date, the fragments of pottery of the Middle Bronze Age were evidenced also, which most probably are related with the Bronze Age site situated only few hundred meters northeast from the fortress. Nonetheless, many amphora's, pithos, jars, jugs, etc. were discovered, of the Late Antique date, which confirms occupancy of the fortress and the church during the 4th‚Äì6th century AD.Milot Berisha, Archaeological Guide of Kosovo,Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.83. =Kasterc Fortress= The archaeological site, respectively the fortification of the Kasterc, positioned more or less 12 kilometers northwest from the town of Suva Reka (Theranda), witnessed to be a multilayer archaeological center that continued to exist from the prehistoric times, more precisely, from a Copper Age as a fortified settlement and then reused and rebuilt into a stronghold during the reign of the emperor Justinian. The site was reused as a necropolis during the medieval period. The fortress area was under three archaeological researches; in 1986, trial trenches were carried out here, reflecting a general overview of this site. Archaeological investigations continued in 2010 and again in 2011, discovering an area of just about 500 square meters, these excavations brought to light an early Christian church and other exclusive movable archaeological material composed of; iron working tools, earthen ware, jewelry, earrings, bracelets, coins, etc. =Vuƒçak Fortress= At the village of Vuƒçak, which is located at the verge of the Kasma√ß Mountain, situated around 12 km southwest from the town of Glogovac, placed in a very dominant position, traces of ruins that follow the terrain configuration of the hill are observable. In fact, there are two forts, one known as the Gjyteti i Madh and Gjyteti i Vog√´l (big fort and small fort). The collected and recorded archaeological material, confirm human activity since prehistoric up to the Medieval period. Nonetheless, this Fortress was typical for the period of the Late Antiquity as it served as a defense system for the local population.Milot Berisha, Archaeological Guide of Kosovo,Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.85. =Stroc Fortress= The village of Stroc is known for the existence of a fortress set at the Gradina hill, a fortress which was used in continuity since prehistory, Late Antiquity and Early Medieval period. Traces of the walls set in the shape of the cascades which incline up to the top of the hill, are noticeable at the Gradina hillside. Even in the present days, traces of the forts towers and ramparts are visible, measuring up to two meters wide walls. Based on the terrain configuration and evidenced remains, presumable at this location, in the past, a cult object used to exist and served to the local population. =Llapushnik Fortress= The Llapushnik fortress is situated at the mountainous area of Drenica region, set close to the Llapushnik outfall, located about 10 km southwest from the town of Drenas. The Llapushnik fortress was characterized with a stronghold fortification measuring 200 with 300 meters. The circuit defense walls were up to 2 meters wide and guarded by side towers. The \\"fortress tower\\" measured 10 x 10 meters, and around the site, Late Antique tiles are scattered all over the place.Milot Berisha, Archaeological Guide of Kosovo,Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.86. =Llanishta Fortress= Around 1 km south from Kaƒçanik, at the decreased area up to maximum 684 meters above the sea level, at the site known as the 'Vranjak' remains of a fortress have been recorded, whereas, a wall of up to 1.7 m wide and 2.5-3m height was recorded. The wall was constructed by the use of local stones bonded with lime mortar and positioned above the natural rocks. Whereas, up in the hill, the wall of the fortress is preserved in line of 50‚Äì60 m length, that follows the contours of the hill. The fortress communicates through a slope with the Llanishta village. =Suka e C√´rmjanit Fortification= On top of a hill around 500 meters above the sea level, in the northern part of the C√´rmjan village, in one geostrategic position, the Suka e C√´rmjanit is positioned, an archeological site known also as the Castel of C√´rmjan. The fortification walls follow the contour line of the rocky terrain configuration in a surface of around 1.3 hectares. The Suka e C√´rmjanit castle has all the features of a fortified settlement of the Late Antique date, although based on the earlier archaeological documentation, remains of a prehistoric date, respectively the occupation commencing from Iron Period continued uninterrupted until the Early Medieval Period. The castle has a distinctive site setting while can visually communicate with; Dollc and Jerina castles of Klina up north, with Radavc and Jablanica of Peƒá castles up northwest, ƒêakovica is visible in the horizon towards southwest, fortress of Zatriƒç is visible toward north-northeast and toward the south the countryside of hills and fields are visible up to the verge of the Pashtrik Mountains.Milot Berisha, Archaeological Guide of Kosovo,Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.88. =Zatriƒç= Remains of the fortified settlement of Iron Age and Late Antique/Early Medieval 'Gradishta' of Zatriƒç, is sited on top of the Zatriƒç hill, with the highest altitude of 1039 meters above the sea level. This 'fortified town' of a multilayer settlement type, was erected in a perimeter line which follows the terrain contour; location chosen which is naturally protected and integrated with the man made constructed protection system. Traces of the fragmented pottery have been found in the entire fortified area, as well at the ‚ÄúArat e Gradisht√´s‚Äù (Gradishta fields) found at the terraced plateaus nearby the fortress. Earthen ware fragmented dishes, of different dates have been found here, like: Iron Age, Hellenistic Period, Late Antique, and Medieval. Nonetheless, this archaeological center, respectively, characteristic fortification site, is unique, where an Italian specialist for the ancient rock art studies, has identified symbols and signs that were evaluated to be a creation of the humans before at least 7 millenniums.Milot Berisha, Archaeological Guide of Kosovo,Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.89. =Veletin Fortress= Veletin fortress is situated around five kilometers southeast from the archaeological site of Ulpiana and approximately, 1.5 kilometers northwest from Janjeva, set on a hilly part of the Shashkoc village which is an 'island' of Municipality of Prishtina. The fortress is located on top of the Veletin hill, reaching the highest elevation of 970 meters above the sea level. Great geostrategic position of the stronghold, clear surveillance on the western part that visually communicates with Ulpiana, which is set on a low land, makes this fort a very important site for the entire surrounding archaeological area. Archaeological excavations carried out here during the eighties, resulted with the fact that the fortress was constructed and reconstructed and was in use since the earlier times, while the ore exploitation and ancient mining was a major economical income commencing from prehistoric periods, continuously through Roman, Late Antique and Medieval Periods.Milot Berisha, Archaeological Guide of Kosovo,Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.90. =Donji Grabovac= The rural settlement of the Grabocit i Ul√´t, is positioned nearby the Drenica river, around 9 km west from the town of Kosovo Polje. At the Berisha neighborhood, at the site known by the locals as ‚ÄúBah√ße‚Äù initially in 2004 and then later in several excavation campaigns, graves within an Early Medieval necropolis were unearthed. Over a dozen graves, in majority in a good and well preserved condition and intact human remains have been excavated and recorded here, except two skeletons which were beheaded. The grave orientations were westeast (respectively the head toward west and the feat toward east). A considerable amount of the fragmented pottery of either glazed medieval but also few prehistoric date fragments of ceramics have been collected here. However, what draws the attention at this site is that the Arb√´r culture witnessed which is mainly composed of; jewelry, weaponry, working tools, pottery and rare glass jars which were part of the grave goods collected in this place. Rewardingly, the grave goods within the burials were very rich especially with the jewelry discovered here. Among the most distinguished findings where; bronze rings, bracelets (one of them is twist decorated) a coin with a hole that might indicate that was used together with a necklace and a pair of bronze granulated earrings.Milot Berisha, Archaeological Guide of Kosovo,Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.91. =Matiƒçane= The filigran artisan work in gold, silver and gems with Byzantine imitations of the jewelry certainly present the work of a skilled local goldsmith, but also illustrates creative artistic talent and on the other hand, reflects on the welfare and high economical and social status of the late (deceased) persons buried at the Matiƒçane necropolis. Besides the grave gods which are a rich archaeological material, respectively precious artifacts, an important documentation in archaeological record, are the physical remains (human remains, skeletons) that from the anthropological aspect offer important information on the buried persons at this necropolis. Earlier village of Matiƒçane, today neighborhood of Pristina, is known in the archaeological literature on the occasion of the discovery and recording of the necropolis known as the Mati√ßani i Posht√´m old cemetery, this later on confirmed based on the material culture and archaeological chronology, this site is dated in the time frame from 10th to 11th century AD. Furthermore, the distinguished necropolis, witnessed mortal remains graves/burials of the local autochthonous Christian population. Rich and abundant grave goods, respectively versatile archaeological material recorded here are composed mainly of woman jewelry of the highest quality and good material, it identifies the flourishing past of this region.Milot Berisha, Archaeological Guide of Kosovo,Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.92. =Novo Brdo= On a smaller mountain set between Prilepnica and Kriva Reka, around 30‚Äì35 km west from Gnjilane and approximately, 39 kilometers south-east from Pristina, the ruins of the medieval town and fortress of Novo Brdo are to be seen. Based on the written sources discovered so far, Novo Brdo was mentioned for the first time at the first decades of the 14th century AD, with the name Nuovo Monte (New Mountain). The Medieval town was a mining center and up to the present days, remains of the walls, watch towers and foundations of several other sacral monuments within the area of the fortress are still preserved. The Novo Brdo fortress is composed by; the Upper Town and the Lower Town, built on the Novo Brdo hill. The Novo Brdo Upper Town, was erected on top of the hill, while below, toward west, the Lower Town stretches in a wide countryside territory. The fortress has access only from the eastern part, whereas from the other parts the hills are steep and inclining toward the walleye. Toward the eastern part, the terrain gradually raises what makes possible to pass to a lower hill in a plateau whereas ruins of a large medieval church of cathedral type are to be found.Milot Berisha, Archaeological Guide of Kosovo,Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.93. =Kaljaja= The historic town of Prizren, unique in position, dwelling structures and vernacular architecture, among tens of other monuments of culture recorded here, is known for a unique fortress known as Kaljaja or Prizren Fortress, which during its existence for many centuries from the ancientness up to nowadays, carries multiple and evident traces of colourful cultural heritage. Kaljaja of Prizren due to the extraordinary good geostrategic position, structural integrity and the wide observation horizon, with all these factors emphases the monumental values of this cultural entity. The fortress of the Kaljaja is situated on a dominant hill at the eastern part of the town of Prizren, set on a strategic position, contoured with lines that follow distinguished features of the terrain natural morphology. Archaeological excavations were carried out here in 1969 and then again in 2004, 2009‚Äì2011; which resulted with the discovery of the infrastructure, which incorporates rampart walls enforced with towers, casemates, labyrinth corridors, depots, and other accompanying inner rooms and dwellings. In the aspect of construction, the fortress is divided in three different complexes which are known as the; Upper Town, Lower Town and Southern Town. While on the fortification aspect phases, the fortress was used in different periods like; Antiquity, Byzantine Period, Medieval Period and Ottoman Period rule. The Prizren Kalaja is one of the most valuable monuments of the Kosovo cultural and historical heritage and is also known as the 'Open Museum'.Milot Berisha, Archaeological Guide of Kosovo,Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.94‚Äì95.

The priory was subordinate to the Priory of the Holy Trinity in Norwich. The slender 12th-century south-west tower in the Early English Gothic style precedes the larger north-west tower in the Perpendicular style of the 15th century.

Elements of the Norman building survive in the base of the south-west tower. =Parish church= After the English Reformation St Margaret's became the parish church for the town of King's Lynn, and its property was used as an endowment for Norwich Cathedral. Prior Drake was made prebend of the fourth stall in Norwich Cathedral. The central lantern and south-west spire collapsed in 1741, which destroyed much of the nave. This was reconstructed in a programme of rebuilding between 1745-46 by the architect Matthew Brettingham in an early Gothic revival style. The Church retains its medieval misericords.

Later immigrants came to the country fleeing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. History The New York City Metropolitan Area, including North Jersey and Brooklyn, is home to the largest Palestinian population in the United States. = Early immigration = The first Palestinians who immigrated to the United States arrived after 1908, when the Ottoman Empire passed a new conscription law mandating Palestinians into the military. These Palestinians were overwhelmingly Christians, and only a minority of them were Muslims. Palestinian immigration began to decline after 1924, with a new law limiting the number of immigrants, as well as the Great Depression, which heavily reduced immigration. = Palestinian exodus = The population in the United States began to increase after World War II. The 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, the Nakba, and the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 caused many Palestinians to immigrate, most as refugees. During the 1950s, many Christians from Ramallah started immigrating to the states, then followed by Muslims from nearby towns. However, the greatest wave of Palestinian immigration began in 1967 after the Six-Day War, or as Middle Easterners and North Africans call it the June War. This wave of immigrants reached its peak in the 1980s. = Modern history = After the Immigration and Nationality act of 1965 was enacted, many Palestinians started immigrating again into the United States. Most Palestinians that immigrated to the United States in this period were more educated than the Palestinians that arrived before 1967, to the schools sponsored by the United Nations and the increasing number of universities in the Middle East. = U.S cities = Most Palestinians settled in the areas surrounding Paterson, and Bay Ridge, which together make up the New York Metropolitan Area. Many other Palestinians settled in Chicago metropolitan area, while some others settled in the Los Angeles metro area, Metro Detroit, and Jacksonville metro; alongside other Mediterranean communities, including the Lebanese, Syrians, Greeks, Italians, Egyptians, Jordanians and Turks. Paterson, New Jersey has its southern half of the city nicknamed Little Ramallah, with an Arab American population estimated as high as 20,000 in 2015. It has the most concentrated area of Palestinian Americans in the entire United States. It is also called Little Istanbul, since it also has a growing Turkish American community. Bay Ridge's Arab community in Brooklyn, New York, is also a significant neighborhood home to an estimated population of 35,000, in which its largest Arab ethnic groups are Palestinians and Yemenis. However, it is also home to many other Arab ethnic groups, making Bay Ridge's Arab community also a strongly diverse population.Bay Ridge in Brooklyn, New York City; also has a strongly diverse Arab community, in which its largest Arab groups are Palestinians and Yemenis. Its strong presence is noticeable from Arab shops to Babel Barber Shop, shown above during the January 2016 snow storm. Chicago, Illinois is also home to a significant population of Palestinians. There is an estimated population of 85,000 Palestinians in Chicago, and Palestinians form 60% of the Arab community in the area. Bridgeview, Illinois, also has a significant population of Palestinians Americans. According to the 2000 United States Census, there were 72,112 people of Palestinian ancestry living in the United States, increasing to 85,186 by the 2009-2013 American Community Survey. It is difficult to count the numbers of Palestinian Americans, since the United States does not recognize the State of Palestine, and only recognizes \\"Palestinian\\" as a nationality. = Religion = Palestinian Muslim Americans practice the Sunni sect of Islam, in the Hanafi and Shafi'i madhab. A large part of Palestinian Christians belong to the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem, with a significant presence of the Latin and Melkite church followers. Smaller minorities adhere to various sects of Protestantism. = Language = Besides English, many Palestinian Americans speak Palestinian Arabic. Palestinians who once lived or worked in Israel or the Palestinian territories may have spoken Modern Hebrew as a second language. Many Palestinians are fluent in other languages. = Education = In the United States approximately 46% of Palestinians have obtained at least a college degree, compared to 18% of the American population. The study of culture and the Arabic language is increasingly important among Palestinians, especially in college and graduate school. Thus, some Palestinian or Arab organizations are working to monitor and improve the teaching of Arab history and culture in the American schools. Palestinians, along with Jordanians, have one of the highest education rates in the Middle East. = Socioeconomics = Among the 90 percent of Palestinian American men and 40 percent of women who are in the labor force, 40 percent and 31 percent, have either professional, technical, or managerial positions. There are also large numbers in sales: 26 percent of men, and 23 percent of women. The self-employment rate for men is a significant 36 percent (only 13 percent for women), compared to 11 percent for non-immigrant men. Of the self- employed, 64 percent are in retail trade, with half owning grocery stores. In terms of income, the mean for Palestinian families in 1979 was $25,400, with 24 percent earning over $35,000 and 20 percent earning less than $10,000. Culture Palestinian culture is a blend of Eastern Mediterranean influences. Palestinians share commonalities with nearby peoples of the Levant, including Egyptians, Lebanese, Syrians, and Jordanians. Kanafeh is a popular Palestinian dessert which originated from Nablus. Kanafeh is becoming very popular in the United States, mostly in New York City. = Cuisine = Palestinians cook many foods native to Palestine, or a broader definition, the Levant. Examples are kanafeh, hummus, falafel, musakhan, waraq al-'inib, and other Palestinian dishes. These foods, such as Kanafeh, have been very popular in the United States, mostly in New York City. = Business = Palestinian Americans have owned Middle Eastern groceries, shops and restaurants ever since their immigration to the United States. Most of these businesses are in large cities such as New York City and Chicago.  Politics  While Palestinian Americans are typically not more politically active than the population at large they are very politically aware of their history and the issues facing their homeland. They are more active in social organizations, such as mosques, churches and local associations, than in political ones, though the former have strong political implications. In the absence of a Palestinian state, the unity and preservation of communities in the diaspora serve to maintain Palestinian identity. = Government = Only several Americans of Palestinian ancestry served as congresspeople. Rashida Tlaib, an American born to Palestinian parents, is a Democratic congresswoman of the Michigan House of Representatives, who ran for U.S. House of Representatives seat from Michigan's 13th congressional district. She became one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress (along with Somali-American Ilhan Omar of Minnesota), and the first Palestinian-American woman in Congress. Justin Amash, is an Independent congressman of Palestinian ancestry, serving in the U.S House of Representatives representing Michigan's 3rd District.

The majority of Kosovars are ethnically Albanian or Serb. Kosovo has an expansive cultural heritage, including monuments, clothing items, museums, and traditional food.  Monuments  Many monuments of Kosovo date from the neolithic period. Throughout history many monuments were changed, destroyed and new elements were added to them. There are different types of monuments that date from the Illyrian period continuing with the Roman Empire, Byzantine Empire, Late Antiquity and Middle Ages, Ottoman Empire period, etc. Most of the historical monuments are stationed in the district of the cities of Pristina, Prizren and Peja. Monuments in Kosovo mostly consist of ancient cities, castles (Kulla), monasteries, mosques and churches. Visoki Deƒçani Monastery (1327) in Deƒçani Some of the most famous monuments in Kosovo are: *The ancient city of Ulpiana (I ‚Äì VII) was an ancient Roman city. Site for archaeological excavations in which several objects were found. These objects include a woman's head, a man's head, head of eros and a tragic mask. *Visoki Deƒçani Monastery (1327‚Äì1335) A major Serbian Orthodox Christian monastery. It is the largest medieval church containing the most extensive fresco decoration. *Patriarchate of Peƒá (1235) A Serbian Orthodox monastery. The complex of churches is the spiritual seat and mausoleum of Serbian archbishops and patriarchs. *Sultan Mehmet Fatih Mosque in Pristina (1461)Located right in the heart of the old town center. It is Pristina's largest and most prominent mosque. Its cupola was once the biggest in the region. The square in front of Mbretit Mosque has always been a popular meeting point. *The house of League of Prizren (1878)): One of Kosovo's most important historical site. It is a museum complex of four buildings. Castles are also very common in Kosovo. The castle of Prizren, the city and castle of Artan√´ which was a huge trade city in the 13th century and earlier, the castle of Kekola an ancient Dardan castle which dates from the Bronze era (1300-1100 b.c), etc. Unfortunately because of the many wars that Kosovo went through in different years and times, many monuments were destroyed.  Museums = Kosovo museum = Founded in 1949, the Kosovo museum has departments of archaeology, ethnography, and natural science, to which a department for the study of history and the National Liberation Struggle was added in 1959. It has been active in sponsoring archaeological excavations, conservation and other scientific work. Since 1956 it has published an annual journal called 'Buletin i Muzeut t√´ Kosov√´s', with articles in Albanian (with summaries in French, English or German).Riedlmayer, Andres. \\"Bosnia Report.\\" Bosnia Report -March - June 2000.

National Museum Of Kosovo is stationed in Pristina was built by Austrians for the Turkish army in 1898, and was used by the Yugoslav national army until 1975. Housed in an Austro Hungarian style house, contained more than 50,000 items exhibited through various pavilions. Also housed here are exhibits expressing the day in the life for the people in various regions. The museum used to have a rich collection of prehistoric objects uncovered in Kosovo ‚Äì these were all spirited off to Belgrade just before the troubles started in 1998, and hundreds of archaeological finds and ethnographic items yet have to be returned. The extensive permanent archaeology exhibition details life in the region in the Illyrian, Dardanian and Roman periods.

They were homemade clothes or made by craftsman specialized in that field. Traditional clothing in Kosovo resembles much of the Albanian traditional clothing if not all the same. There are over 200 different kinds of clothing and styles of wearing the clothes all depending of where you're from, the history of your fis (clan), and many more reasons. First is the headgear, a woolen cone-shaped plis for the male, and a pashnik headdress for the female of a common red color. The plis is white and in some regions men cover it round with a pashnik and in region of Rugova men cover it round with a white cotton scarf. Second is the pants or dress, depending on the style and gender. The men usually have on long woolen white pants called tirq or a fustanella which is a skirt like costume. The women wear a xhubleta which is a skirt like type of clothing as well, only it can resemble more as an apron in the front instead. Before wearing the shoes, both men and women had socks or √áorape and finally came the Openga or shoes worn by men, whereas women would usually wear wooden clogs.\\"Kosovo Culture - Be in Kosovo - Visit Kosovo - Business in Kosovo - Invest in Kosovo - Tourism in Kosovo - Rent a Car in Pristina - Guides in Kosovo - Study in Kosovo.\\"Be In Kosovo.

Prishtin√´: Akademia E Shkencave Dhe E Arteve E Kosov√´s, 2011Girls from ≈†trpce in Serbian traditional costumes Traditional Clothing is one of the major factors that has distinguished this nation from its neighboring countries. The motifs and patterns on these garments can be explained by prehistoric religion and chromatically there are three basic colors, the most symbolic of which is red. Overall, women's clothing was better preserved than men as there are regional variations in how these traditional clothes are worn. The most famous was the 'p√´shtjellak', which consisted of a long white shirt and two aprons one for the front and one for the back. Another clothing style worn by the women of Kosovo is the xhubleta, which is a bell wavy skirt which is held by two straps on the shoulders, worn on top of a long-sleeved white linen shirt. The next style is often referred to as the most beautiful of Kosovo clothing. The Veshja e Dukagjinit was a white long sleeve cotton shirt but the edges were colorfully embodied. The last style for the women was that of the southern region of has. This clothing was more distinctive and is commonly found today as it has survived and embraced changes in styles. This look consists of a short white shirt and a full length linen dress. Men's clothing was a symbol of beauty, however it was less preservative. Unlike women's clothing men's clothing is more uniformed and seemed to change less from region to region. The most popular was the \\"tirqi\\" apparel. The look similar to women with the white shirt and vest, the tirqi which were woollen white pants where strictly a characteristic of the men.babies = Traditional food in Kosovo = The best- known of all and most distinctive one, \\"flija\\", is prepared year-round but is a summer favourite. Flija made with \\"sa√ß\\" is a speciality from the traditional Albanian cuisine, that is mostly prepared in mountainous areas. It is most certainly one of the typical Kosovar dishes that everyone local will recommend. Baklava is one of the traditional pastries of the Kosovar cuisine, although of Turkish origin. Bakllasarem is also a traditional food of Kosovo it is a salty pie with yoghurt and garlic covering. The Kosovo cuisine developed under the influence Albanian, Turkish, Serbian, Croatian Greek and Italian dishes. The national food of Kosovo is Cheese Byrek. Byrek is a type of baked or filled pastry. They are made of a thin flaky dough known as phyllo dough and are filled with salty cheese (often feta), minced meat, potatoes or other vegetables. Meat is well represented in their daily meals. Due to the harsh continental climate vegetables are seasonal flourishing mainly in the summer.\\"Kosovar Cuisine.\\" Kosovo. N.p., n.d. Web. 24 Feb. 2013. http://www.kosovoguide.com/?cid=2,227  Intangible culture  Generally speaking, Albanians are a very secular people. The majority of the Albanian people in Kosovo are of Muslim background and there is still a high percentage of Muslims in Kosovo. On the other hand, the Spiritual Kosovan Culture is not very influenced by the religion. One can quote a line from a poem of Pashko Vasa, a 19th-century Catholic writer, who said that \\"The religion of the Albanians is Albanianism\\", meaning that the Albanians identity doesn't derive from their religion.Judah, Tim. \\"Albanians.\\" Kosovo: What Everyone Needs to Know. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2008. What influences the Kosovan-Albanian cultural heritage the most is the Kanun. This set of laws and rules used to be oral and got published later. Due to the fact that a part of them is very primitive, they aren't used as much anymore, however these rules are a great part of the Kosovar cultural heritage. = Folklore = Serbian traditional dance (kolo) from Gnjilane The Ottoman Empire left behind their religion, their language, and their people in Kosovo(dating back to the 14th century). All three mark important facts of the Kosovar culture today. Kosovo has 2 official languages, Albanian and Serbian.library Although they have strong Turkish roots in their folkloric music, the mass are not fluent in Turkish, it is only the elders in secular groups and municipalities that speak Turkish. According to the Kosovo Ministry of Education, each student must master and demonstrate their mother tongue during primary and secondary schooling in whichever language they choose (although most students take up the Albanian mother tongue). In addition the first foreign language that every student must demonstrate proficiency, is English. The influence of the Ottomans had a spill-over effect of cultural and religious identity which resulted in the construction of many religious monuments and artifacts in Kosovo. Over 90% of Kosovar-Albanians are of Islamic religion primarily due to the occupation of the Ottoman Empire.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4385768.stm Aside from Turkish- religious-structural influences, the current Kosovar culture was also influenced by other ethnic minorities within the region constituting, but not limited to: Roma, Serb, Bosnian, Ashkali, Gorani, etc.http://www.rootsworld.com/turkey/cumbus.htmlhttps://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0009_0_09187.html Thus, instruments like the KemencheHugo Pinksterboer, Tipbook: Cello (2002), p. 106. and traditional dances such as Hora from the Turkish culture become a symbol of Kosovar ethnic identity. Similarly, the instrument knows as the Cifteli, is also a widely used instrument in Kosovo with origins from the Turkish culture that dates back to the early Ottoman Empire. Likewise, the Serbians adopted music known as \\"tallava\\", a fast-paced folk music type, which has had a great influence in the recent years in Kosovo culture. Albanian traditional Dance Folklore and Oral tradition have been present throughout the history of Kosovo, where these two elements played a crucial role in communicating important information, history and events among communities and generations. A low literacy rate and dynamics of life style in rural areas limited the ability to document important developments in written formats. Consequently, communities transmitted important national events and collective memories to younger generations through oral traditions, including legends, songs, proverbs and stories.Intangible Cultural Heritage: A Strangely Familiar Concept! N.p., n.d. Web. =Religion= Patriarchate of Peƒá, the seat of the Serbian Orthodox Church from the 14th century There is no official religion in Kosovo, although the country is predominantly Muslim as the majority of Albanians are Muslim. Most of the ethnic Serbs practice Eastern Orthodoxy. = Oral history = Unwritten or customary rules are very frequently practiced as law and order among Kosovans with its principles being: *Personal honor *The equality of persons *The freedom of each to act in accordance with own honor, with law limits, and without being subject to another's commands *The word of honor known as \\"besa\\" creating a situation of inviolable trust (upon Besa, Kosovars take the person's honor and the person's life the remote areas of the country. Among the current modern times, the former customs and traditions are gradually vanishing due to the influence of the western world The elderly generations are the ones who assist in keeping such customs and traditions alive. Lahutari - An old man telling a story Oral traditions have served as vehicles to pass cultural values to next generations and taught lessons about collective memories and experiences, which played a bridge role between generations. While oral traditions had a very positive effect over the centuries, they also enforced social and legal regulations, such as the five- century old Besa and Kanun, which were established and maintained by the traditional institution named oda (chamber).  Oda  The concept of \\"Oda\\", whether it is considered as gathering at a space or a traditional institution, is a rooted spiritual cultural heritage asset in Kosovo. Figuratively, \\"Oda\\" represents a special and distinguished space of a house (a room), which is exclusively dedicated to the elderly men to discuss important family, community or national issues. Moreover, Oda symbolizes the court of law where men, gather to discuss and solve property problems, blood feuds etc. This space was also an important platform of social, cultural life and entertainment for men. Today, after many centuries of practice, \\"Oda\\" is still alive and valued in certain communities in Kosovo (mainly rural).  Besa  \\"Besa\\" is a famous feature of all Albanian people. It mainly represents a \\"word of honor\\" or \\"promise\\". The \\"man of Besa\\" connotes a man of respect and honour, someone to whom you can trust your life and family. The man who breaks Besa is a man unable to save his Besa and is worth nothing. A man like that will risk of being banished from the community. Besa is the moral testament of Albanians since the appearance of its earliest national and social mythologies.Kushova, Alma. \\"Besa.\\" (2004): n. pag. Besa OpenDemocracy. Web. 24 Feb. 2013. http://www.opendemocracy.net/arts/article_2114.jsp  Kanun  Kanun is a set of unwritten laws and rules which were only published in the 20th century. Kanun of Lek√´ Dukaghini is composed of 12 books and 1,262 articles. These are the twelve books: # Church; # Family; # Marriage; # House, Livestock and Property; # Work; # Transfer of Property; # Spoken Word; # Honor; # Damages; # Law Regarding Crimes; # The kanun of the elderly; # Exemptions and Exceptions. = Language preservation = The Albanian Language is the main language in Kosovo. Albanian, has two main dialects: Geg (in the northern part) and Tosk (in the southern part). Therefore, the Albanian language spoken in Kosovo is much more similar to the Geg dialect, even though the standard Albanian language has been established long ago based on the Tosk dialect. However, the main official language in Kosovo is: standard Albanian. Despite that, minorities in Kosovo still strive to protect their own languages. For example, in Prizren, almost every institution has its name written in Turkish as well. The OSCE said Kosovo should do more to enable members of different communities to learn each other's languages and overcome linguistic barriers. The legislative framework in Kosovo obliges institutions to provide services in the official languages in use, but there are shortcomings in how that is being implemented. \\"Those shortcomings can be overcome with capacity building within institutions, be it by enabling municipalities to hire translators or to better train the existing ones or by helping them develop forms and signs in the official languages,\\" Gaon told SETimes.\\"Overcoming Language Barriers in Kosovo.\\" (SETimes.com).

During the 1998-1999 conflict, more than a third of Kosovo's 600 mosques were damaged or destroyed.UNESCO Courier. Sep2000, Vol. 53 Issue 9, p40. 1p Kosovo's Islamic heritage suffered devastating events during the \\"ethnic cleansing\\" operations. Qurans were found with pages ripped out and spread with feces, and valuable collections of Islamic manuscripts were burned. Preservation of cultural heritage is always difficult to discuss since every side in the wars made a contribution to the destruction rather than preserving the architecture of the other ethnicity.Religion in Eastern Europe.

Preserving what is left and restoring what is lost, is one of the main goals of the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning, and many other non- governmental organisations such as: CHwB and RIC. Their work is dedicated in rescuing and preserving tangible and intangible cultural heritage touched by conflict, neglect or human and natural disasters. There are many projects that are organised for this cause and one of them is the annual \\"Tour de Culture\\", which attracts many people from many countries. In this event, many monuments all around Kosovo are promoted and the interesting part is that all of the transport is done by bicycles.

The Hamas administration is often referred to as the Hamas government in Gaza. The Hamas party won the Palestinian legislative elections on 25 January 2006, and Ismail Haniyeh was nominated as Prime Minister, establishing a Palestinian national unity government with Fatah, which effectively collapsed when Hamas and Fatah engaged in a violent conflict. After the takeover in Gaza by Hamas on 14 June 2007, Palestinian Authority Chairman Abbas dismissed the Hamas-led government and appointed Salam Fayyad as Prime Minister. Though the new Ramallah-based Palestinian government's authority was claimed to extend to all Palestinian territories, in effect it became limited to the West Bank areas, as Hamas hadn't recognized the move and continued to rule the Gaza Strip. Both administrations ‚Äì the Fatah government in Ramallah and the Hamas government in Gaza regarded themselves as the sole legitimate government of the Palestinian National Authority. The international community and Palestine Liberation Organization, however, recognized the Ramallah administration as the legitimate government. Since the division between the two parties, there have been conflicts between Hamas and similar factions operating in Gaza, and with Israel, most notably the Gaza War of 2008-2009 and the 2014 Gaza War. The radicalization of the Gaza Strip brought internal conflicts between various groups, in events like 2009 Hamas crackdown on Jund Ansar Allah, an al-Qaeda affiliated group, resulting in 22 people killed; and the April 2011 Hamas crackdown on Jahafil Al-Tawhid Wal-Jihad fi Filastin, a Salafist group involved in Vittorio Arrigoni's murder. Since 2015, ISIL-affiliated groups in Gaza have also become Hamas' matter of concern. Negotiations toward reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas, which were mediated by Egypt, produced a preliminary agreement in 2011, which was supposed to be implemented by May 2012 through joint elections. Despite the peace plan, Palestinian sources were quoted in January 2012 as saying that the May joint elections \\"would not be possible\\". In February 2012, Khaled Meshal and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas signed the Hamas‚ÄìFatah Doha agreement towards implementation of the 2011 Cairo accords, though Hamas officials in the Gaza Strip expressed their discontent and \\"unacceptibility\\" of the Doha agreement. A unity government was sworn on 2 June 2014. The government was supposed to exercise its functions in Gaza, or to form a government of national unity whose members would be from all Palestinian factions, including Hamas, Fatah and all other factions, and which would be responsible for Gaza and the West Bank and prepare for elections but it did not happen because of disagreements between the two parties. Nevertheless, the unity government had failed to implement authority over Gaza Strip and from September 2016 Hamas gradually expanded the authority of its Deputy Minister and Director General-level positions based in Gaza, in a move widely referred as establishment of an alternative government. History=Prelude to division= Conflict between Fatah and Hamas began simmering when Hamas won the Palestinian legislative elections in January 2006. Israel, the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations demanded that the new Hamas government accept all previous agreements, recognize Israel's right to exist, and renounce violence; when Hamas refused, they cut off aid to the Palestinian Authority. Major conflict erupted in Gaza in December 2006, when the Hamas executive authority attempted to replace the Palestinian police as the primary authority in Gaza. On 8 February 2007 Saudi- sponsored negotiations in Mecca produced an agreement on a Palestinian national unity government. The agreement was signed by Mahmoud Abbas on behalf of Fatah and Khaled Mashal on behalf of Hamas. The new government was called on to achieve Palestinian national goals as approved by the Palestine National Council, the clauses of the Basic Law and the National Reconciliation Document (the \\"Prisoners' Document\\") as well as the decisions of the Arab summit. In March 2007, the Palestinian Legislative Council established a national unity government, with 83 representatives voting in favor and three against. Government ministers were sworn in by Mahmoud Abbas, the president on the Palestinian National Authority, at ceremonies held in Gaza and Ramallah. In June that year, Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip from the national unity government after forcing out Fatah. On 14 June 2007, Mahmoud Abbas announced the dissolution of the former unity government and declared a state of emergency. He dismissed Ismail Haniya as prime minister and appointed Salam Fayyad in his place, giving him the task of building a new government. Nonetheless, Ismail Haniya of the Hamas rejected the decree of Mahmoud Abbas and said his government would remain in office and would continue to function as the government of the Palestinian National Authority. =June 2007 Hamas government=Takeover by Hamas With Hamas being in control of the Gaza Strip and Fatah in control of the West Bank, there turned to be de facto two Palestinian Authority governments, both considering themselves to be the legitimate government. With dismissal of the Hamas cabinet members by Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas, Hamas Prime Minister Haniyye refused to acknowledge the dismissal of his government, but had to establish a new Hamas government in June 2007, as West Bank resident Ministers in Palestinian government were deposed by Fatah. Palestinian police chief Kamal el-Sheikh ordered his men in the Gaza Strip not to work or obey Hamas orders. Many Fatah members fled the Gaza Strip to the West Bank, and Fatah gunmen stormed Hamas- led institutions in the West Bank after the Battle of Gaza. Palestinian legislator Saeb Erekat said the Palestinian National Authority officially has no control in the Gaza Strip. Hamas and Fatah accused each other of a coup d'√©tat; neither recognizes the authority of the other government. The United States, EU, and Israel have not recognized the Hamas government, but support Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad's government in the West Bank. The Arab League called on all parties to stop the fighting and return the government to its status before the Battle of Gaza, which would be the 2007 unity government and not the new Palestinian National Authority government appointed by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Although the US does not officially recognize the Hamas government, it holds it \\"fully and entirely responsible for the Gaza Strip,\\" United States Assistant Secretary of State Sean McCormack said. On 16 June 2007, Ismail Haniya declared Said Fanuna (officially a Fatah general who, in reality, distanced himself from Mahmoud Abbas) as the new security chief in the Gaza Strip, stating him as a \\"higher police command\\" than the West Bank-based police chief Kamal el-Sheikh of the Fatah. Internal and external conflicts After the division of the two Palestinian parties, the West Bank remained relatively quiet, but the Gaza Strip was the scene of constant conflict between Hamas and various other factions opposing Israel, with the most notable conflict being the Gaza War of 2008-2009. In 2009, a radical Salafist cleric declared an \\"Islamic Emirate\\" in Gaza, accusing Hamas of failing to implement full Sharia law. The radicalization of the Gaza Strip and attempt to undermine Hamas authority resulted in the 2009 Hamas crackdown on Jund Ansar Allah, an Al-Qaeda affiliated group, that lasted two days and resulted in 22 deaths. Reports in March 2010 suggested that Ahmed Jabari described the security situation in Gaza as deteriorating, and that Hamas was starting to lose control. Nevertheless, the Hamas continued to execute its authority. In April 2011, Hamas conducted another crackdown, this one on a Salafist group reportedly involved in Vittorio Arrigoni's murder. During the Arab Spring Hamas praised the Arab Spring, but its offices in Damascus were directly affected by the Syrian Civil War. The Hamas leader Khaled Mashal eventually relocated to Jordan, and Hamas began to distance itself from the Syrian government in the backdrop of the Syrian civil war. The evacuation of Hamas offices from Damascus may be the principal reason for the Doha ratification agreement signed by Mahmud Abbas and Khaled Mashal, but it was also suggested that this was done due to a rift between Hamas Government in Gaza and the external Hamas office, led by Khaled Mashal. Essentially, the Doha deal does not reflect any real reconciliation among the factions of the Hamas Government. Following the events of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution, and the consequent election of an Islamist president in Egypt, Hamas relations with Egypt improved, and in 2012 Egypt eased the permit requirements for Palestinians from Gaza entering through the Rafah crossing. In July 2012, reports circulated that the Hamas Government in Gaza Strip was considering declaring the independence of the Gaza Strip with the help of Egypt. =September 2012 Hamas government= In September 2012, Ismail Haniya, head of the Hamas government in Gaza, announced a cabinet reshuffle, appointing seven new ministers including a new finance minister. Haniya said the reshuffle was \\"normal procedure after nearly six years of work by some ministers and in order to achieve specific goals for the current period.\\" Haniya said he had postponed carrying out the cabinet reshuffle several times to allow time for a reconciliation process between Fatah and Hamas to succeed. The two sides have been trying to implement the terms of an April 2011 reconciliation deal for months now, but appear no closer to achieving either the consensus interim government or the legislative and presidential elections called for by the agreement. This followed a May 2012, a new Fatah government appointment in the West Bank, in a move that has angered the Hamas government in Gaza, which slammed the decision to form a new cabinet, accusing Abbas's Palestinian Authority and the Fatah movement he heads of abandoning reconciliation. =2016 Hamas administration= The Hamas government of 2016 is the Gaza-based faction of the Palestinian government and is a de facto third Hamas government, ruling over the Gaza Strip since the split of the Palestinian National Authority in 2007. Government Media Office in the Gaza Strip announced on 17 October 2016 that the Supreme Administrative Committee, which is in charge of the conduct of Gaza's ministries, had taken a decision to carry out a Cabinet reshuffle in active ministries and change the positions of 16 deputy ministers and directors general in government institutions. The 2016 Gaza administration was composed of Deputy Ministers, Director Generals and other high-level officials, not directly bound to the Ramallah administration. It was initially speculated that the 2016 Hamas government is an attempt to return of Ismail Haniyeh to full control of the Gaza enclave. As part of government reform, it was decided to abolish the Ministry of Planning. According to some views, the third Hamas cabinet de facto succeeded the failed 2014 national unity government, which was reshuffled by Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas in July 2015 without Hamas consent and was announced by Hamas as expired on 19 October 2016. \\"Coalition for Accountability and Integrity - Aman\\" said that the formation of this committee was a declaration of a new government in the Gaza Strip. Youssef Mahmoud, the spokesman for the consensus Palestinian government, said that every action made in Gaza without the consensus government's approval is illegitimate and not recognized by the Ramallah government. Ismail Haniyeh, the Prime Minister of the 2007 and 2012 Hamas-led governments, considers the 2015 Fatah-dominated government in Ramallah as illegitimate. The Hamas government of 2016 exercises de facto rule over the Gaza Strip, supported by the Palestinian Legislative Council, which is dominated by members of Hamas. In March 2017, Ramallah-based Fatah dominated government of the State of Palestine expressed its concern that Gaza administration authority is being upgraded by Hamas into a full-fledged 'shadow government'. Further in April and May 2017, Palestinian President Abbas vowed to take unprecedented measures to end the division - cutting 30-50% of Gaza Strip-based employees of the Palestinian administration, suspending social assistance to 630 families and preventing Gazan cancer patients from reaching treatment in Jerusalem or Israeli hospitals. In addition, Ramallah-based government stopped paying for Gazan electricity bills to Israel and on April 28 President Abbas approved early retirement to 35,000 military personnel in Gaza (originally funded by Ramallah administration) and cut financial aid to former Hamas prisoners. Government and politics In 2006, Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian legislative elections and assumed administrative control of Gaza Strip and West Bank. In 2007, Hamas led a military victory over Fatah, the secular Palestinian nationalist party, which had dominated the Palestinian National Authority. As a result, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas declared state of emergency and released Hamas Prime Minister Haniye - a move not recognized by the Hamas party, which de facto continued administration and military control of the Gaza Strip, while in the PNA controlled West Bank another government was established with Fatah domination. Both regimes - the Ramallah and Gaza government regard themselves as the sole legitimate government of the Palestinian National Authority. Egyptian-mediated negotiations toward reconciliation between the Fatah and the Hamas government produced a preliminary agreement, planned to be implemented by May 2012 in joint elections. To date, the Hamas government is only economically bonded with the Ramallah-based Palestinian National Authority, performing the governing over the Gaza Strip independently. =Governing structure= Map showing Gaza governorates Governorates of the Gaza Strip are 5 administrative districts. After the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip were divided into three areas (Area A, Area B, and Area C) and 16 governorates under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian National Authority. In 2005, Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip, enlarging the administered Palestinian territories in that region. In 2007, following the War of Brothers in the Gaza Strip between Fatah and Hamas, the later took over the area and expelled all Palestinian Authority officials, affiliated with Fatah. It has since administered the five districts, including eight cities. *Deir al-Balah Governorate *Khan Yunis Governorate *Rafah Governorate *North Gaza Governorate *Gaza Governorate = Security = After having confronted and disarmed significant Fatah-supporting hamullas, or clans, Hamas had a near monopoly on arms inside Gaza. In March 2010, however, Ahmed Jabari described the security situation in Gaza as deteriorating and said Hamas was starting to lose control. In June 2011, the Independent Commission for Human Rights published a report whose findings included that the Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip were subjected in 2010 to an \\"almost systematic campaign\\" of human rights abuses by the Ramallah and Hamas administrations, as well as by Israeli authorities, with the security forces belonging to the Ramallah and Hamas government being responsible for torture, arrests and arbitrary detentions. A 2012 report by Nathan J. Brown found increasing authoritarian actions in the administration of the Gaza Strip, with opposition parties restricted from performing public activities. Brown found that the Hamas government increasingly took on tendencies seen in past administrations by the rival Fatah party, which ruled over the West Bank. Parties affiliated with Fatah, as well as affiliated NGOs, have been subjected to stricter controls. One such NGO, the Sharek Youth Forum, was closed in 2010.Brown, Nathan J. Gaza Five Years On: Hamas Settles In Carnegie Endowment, June 2012 The United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in the occupied Palestinian Territory requested that Hamas reconsider dissolving that NGO.Statement by Maxwell Gaylard, United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in the occupied Palestinian Territory On the Dissolution of Sharek Youth Forum in the Gaza Strip 20 July 2011 In June 2013, as a result of pressure from Egypt, Hamas deployed a 600-strong force to prevent rocket fire into Israel from Gaza. The following months showed a dramatic decline in the number of rockets fired at Israel. Hamas deploys 600-strong force to prevent rocket fire at Israel, Times of Israel, June 17, 2013 in February 2014, however, Hamas removed most of the anti-rocket force it had deployed to prevent cross-border attacks on Israel. This move by Hamas is likely to have been interpreted as a green light to fire on Israel by the various other terror groups in Gaza, such as the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, which carried out in excess of 60 rocket attacks on southern Israel, on March 12, 2014 alone. In the wake of this incident of rocket-fire into Israel, and the many other incidents that followed, Israel warned that it might invade Gaza if the attacks did not cease.Hamas has removed most of the 900-strong force it employs to prevent rocket fire into Israel from Gaza, Times of Israel, February 1, 2014 As further rocket attacks continued, Israel took action in the summer of 2014 by carrying out a temporary invasion of the Gaza Strip, during which more than 800 Hamas members were killed by the IDF (according to Israel's ITIC organization) \\\\- note that casualty statistics in Gaza-Israeli conflicts are commonly up for debate and controversy (the latter analyses the casualty figures from the 2008-09 Gaza conflict). This came as a major blow to Hamas, and to their support in the Gaza Strip. The emergence of a recent faction of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (yet to be officially confirmed) within the Strip has also added security-concerns amongst Hamas officials, following the unsuccessful defence of the Strip against Israel's Operation Protective Edge. On May 31, 2015, the Islamic State Group offshoot, also calling itself the \\"Sheikh Omar Hadid Brigade\\", claimed responsibility for the assassination of a high ranking Hamas commander, whose vehicle was blown up when an on-board bomb was detonated. = Finance and economics = Upon taking power, Hamas announced they would refuse to honour past international agreements between the Palestinian government and Israel. As a result, the United States and the EU cut off aid to the Gaza Strip, and Israel and the Middle East Quartet implemented punitive economic measures against the Gaza Strip. They view the group as a terrorist organization, and have pressured Hamas to recognize Israel, renounce violence, and make good on past agreements. Prior to disengagement, 120,000 Palestinians from Gaza were employed in Israel or in joint projects. After the Israeli withdrawal, the gross domestic product of the Gaza Strip declined. Israeli enterprises shut down, work relationships were severed and job opportunities in Israel dried up. Following Hamas takeover in 2007, key international powers, including the EU, US and Israel showed public support for the new Fatah administration without Hamas. The EU and US normalized the tie to the Palestinian National Authority and resumed direct aid. Israel announced it would return frozen tax revenue of about US$800m to the new Fatah administration. Israel also imposed a naval blockade of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, which ensured Mediterranean imports of goods into the Strip did not include any sort of weaponry. The naval policy was stopped, and then was re-initiated in early 2014, when an arms shipment was seized by the IDF. The move disabled Hamas from making further investments in weapon-trade with Iran, and other Iranian backed groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon. Despite the active blockade (which many claimed also restricted non-weapon related trade, such as food supply), Hamas leader Mahmoud Zahar said, speaking in 2012, that Gaza's economic situation has improved and Gaza has become self-reliant \\"in several aspects except petroleum and electricity.\\" Zahar said that Gaza's economic conditions are better than those in the West Bank. However, such statements have been considered political propaganda by many, and could have been aimed towards diminishing the economic successes of the rival Fatah political party in the West Bank, at a time when tensions between the two parties became particularly intense. 2012 fuel crisis Gaza generally obtained its diesel fuel from Israel, but in 2011, Hamas began buying cheaper fuel from Egypt, bringing it via a network of tunnels, and refused to buy it from Israel. In early 2012, due to internal economic disagreement between the Palestinian Authority and the Hamas Government in Gaza, decreased supplies from Egypt through tunnel smuggling, and Hamas's refusal to ship fuel via Israel, the Gaza Strip plunged into a fuel crisis, bringing increasingly long electricity shut downs and disruption of transportation. Egypt attempted to stop the use of tunnels for delivery of Egyptian fuel purchased by Palestinian authorities, and severely reduced supply through the tunnel network. As the crisis deepened, Hamas sought to equip the Rafah terminal between Egypt and Gaza for fuel transfer, and refused to accept fuel delivered via the Kerem Shalom crossing between Israel and Gaza. In mid-February, as the crisis escalated, Hamas rejected an Egyptian proposal to bring in fuel via the Kerem Shalom Crossing between Israel and Gaza to reactivate Gaza's only power plant. Ahmed Abu Al-Amreen of the Hamas-run Energy Authority refused it on the grounds that the crossing is operated by Israel and Hamas' fierce opposition to the existence of Israel. Egypt cannot ship diesel fuel to Gaza directly through the Rafah crossing point, because it is limited to the movement of individuals. In early March, the head of Gaza's energy authority stated that Egypt wanted to transfer energy via the Kerem Shalom Crossing, but he personally refused it to go through the \\"Zionist entity\\" (Israel) and insisted that Egypt transfer the fuel through the Rafah Crossing, although this crossing is not equipped to handle the half-million liters needed each day. In late March, Hamas began offering carpools of Hamas state vehicles for people to get to work. Many Gazans began to wonder how these vehicles have fuel themselves, as diesel was completely unavailable in Gaza, ambulances could no longer be used, but Hamas government officials still had fuel for their own cars. Many Gazans said that Hamas confiscated the fuel it needed from petrol stations and used it exclusively for their own purposes. > Responded with another citizen of Rafah: 'Nude talk more about health crisis > in Rafah and more exploited in the Drivers' Rafah ', while the other > response more sharply, he said:' I wish, Lord, tells the story of Sheikh Eid > any of these buses come from? , Is the bus power was to change the color and > print the names and fake companies, good company, company Ailia, Islamic > Society, as well as be confiscated diesel fuel from the stations and tunnels > and traders, and is then to organize a campaign on behalf of Hamas to > relieve citizens, but everyone knows ...... ., the story of diesel buses and > the story of a failed attempt to improve the image of Hamas' Egypt agreed to provide 600,000 liters of fuel to Gaza daily, but it had no way of delivering it that Hamas would agree to. In addition, Israel introduced a number of goods and vehicles into the Gaza Strip via the Kerem Shalom Crossing, as well as the normal diesel for hospitals. Israel also shipped 150,000 liters of diesel through the crossing, which was paid for by the Red Cross. In April 2012, the issue was resolved as certain amounts of fuel were supplied with the involvement of the Red Cross, after the Palestinian Authority and Hamas reached a deal. Fuel was finally transferred via the Israeli Kerem Shalom Crossing. International aid=Israeli cooperation= In January and February 2011, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) conducted an assessment of the effects of the measures to ease the access restrictions. They concluded that they did not result in a significant improvement in people's livelihoods. They found that the \\"pivotal nature of the remaining restrictions\\" and the effects of three years of strict blockade prevented a significant improvement in livelihoods and called on Israel to fully abolish the blockade including removing restrictions on the import of construction materials and the exports of goods, and to lift the general ban on the movement of people between Gaza and the West Bank via Israel in order to comply with what they described as international humanitarian and human rights law obligations. =International visits= Qatari Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani became the first foreign leader to visit the enclave since Hamas' takeover. On 16 November 2012, following the death of Ahmed Jabril, Egyptian Prime Minister Hisham Qandil visited the enclave, leading to a brief ceasefire offer by Israel. Tunisia's Foreign Minister Rafik Abdessalem and Turkey's Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu visited Gaza in November 2012 as well. Current budget Most of the Gaza Strip administration funding comes from outside as an aid, with large portion delivered by UN organizations directly to education and food supply. Most of the Gaza GDP of $700 million comes as foreign humanitarian and direct economic support. Of those funds, the major part is supported by the U.S. and the European Union. Portions of the direct economic support have been provided by the Arab League, though it largely has not provided funds according to schedule. Among other alleged sources of Gaza administration budget is Iran. A diplomatic source told Reuters that Iran had funded Hamas in the past with up to $300 million per year, but the flow of money had not been regular in 2011. \\"Payment has been in suspension since August\\", said the source. \\"The head of the Hamas government in Gaza, Ismail Haniyeh, arrived in Qatar on Monday, beginning a regional tour that is also expected to take him to Kuwait, Bahrain and Iran.\\" The government of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria had been a stalwart ally and a conduit for Iranian money. But due to sectarian considerations following the revolt in Syria, Hamas decided to shut its political bureau in Damascus. Hamas' break with Syria has meant a sharp cut in the financing it received from Iran. In response, Hamas has raised taxes and fees considerably. Setting up its own lavish civil administration in Gaza that issues papers, licenses, insurance and numerous other permissions ‚Äî and always for a tax or a fee. In January 2012, some diplomatic sources have said that Turkey promised to provide Haniyeh's Gaza Strip administration with $300 million to support its annual budget. In April 2012, the Hamas government in Gaza approved its budget for 2012, which was up 25% year-on-year over 2011 budget, indicating that donors, including Iran, benefactors in the Islamic world and Palestinian expatriates, are still heavily funding the movement. Chief of Gaza's parliament's budget committee Jamal Nassar said the 2012 budget is $769 million, compared to $630 million in 2011. According to OpEd Columnist Thomas Friedman of the NY Times, Gaza has been woefully mismanaged by Hamas, Gaza is pumping all its drinking water from its coastal aquifer at triple its renewable rate of recharge. As a result, saltwater is seeping in. In 2013, the U.N. said that by 2016 there will be no potable water left in Gaza's main aquifer. Gaza has no big desalination plant and would not have the electricity to run it anyway.Whose Garbage Is This Anyway?, nytimes, FEB. 8, 2014 See also *Hamastan *Palestinian political violence ReferencesExternal links *Pelham, Nicolas.

The warm, humid climate of the Holocene which came soon after the ice melting of the last glacial period brought changes in nature which were reflected in humans, flora and fauna. This climatic stabilization influenced human life and activities; human society is characterized by changes in community organization and the establishment of permanent settlements in dry places, near riverbanks and on fertile plateaus. Neolithic man used stone for weapons, tools and building. The cultural characteristics of the Neolithic are determined by the archaeological documentation. Major changes occurred during the period, including a shift from hunting and gathering to agriculture and settlement. Animals were domesticated and pottery produced. Humans evolved from nomadic to semi-nomadic life; crop cultivation was the main economic activity, and the land was worked with stone, bone, horn and wooden tools. Women made clothing, pottery, cared for children, prepared food and domesticated small animals. Most anthropomorphic figurines represent female bodies. The Neolithic economy was based on agriculture, the manufacture of tools, weapons and pottery, domesticating and breeding animal, hunting and fishing. Therefore, settlements were developed near natural resources. Most Neolithic sites in Kosovo feature dwellings built from materials found near the settlements: huts with wooden frames and sticks, coated with soil and mixed with oat chaff, with roofs made from twisted cane and rye chaff. Although archaeologists and academics differ about the exact dates of the Neolithic in the Balkans, it is generally agreed that the period extended from 6500 to 3500 BC. Cave and rock art confirm the use of caves as temporary shelters and places of worship. The primary cult was that of the mother goddess, and Neolithic society was matriarchal.Milot Berisha, Kosovo Archaeological Guide, Kosovo Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports and Archaeological Institute of Kosovo, 2012. Settlements=Vlashnj√´= The multi-layer settlement of Vlashnj√´ is located on the flat plateau of a raised rocky terrace above sea level, on the Pristina-Zhur road about west of Prizren. The site contains evidence from a number of periods, from the early Starƒçevo and Vinƒça cultures through the Copper, Bronze and Iron Ages to the Hellenistic, Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. Materials found at the site include clay pottery and vessel fragments, stone and bone tools, decorative and utilitarian artifacts and coins. During Late Antiquity, Vla≈°nja (known as Gradi≈°ta of Vla≈°nja) was fortified with walls typical of Justinian I. The fortified area, covering about , was probably used to observe the Via Lissus-Naissus (which bypassed the settlement). Pottery fragments painted with geometric lines, a Starƒçevo flint knife, and anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines from the sixth millennium BC have been unearthed. A decorated baked- clay pot typical of the Vinƒça culture (third millennium BC), Bronze Age baked- clay table vessels and a 3.72-gram coin dating to 55 BC have also been found.Berisha, p. 13. A rock shelter with painted spirals is about west of the site. =Runik= This site is in the village of Runik in the municipality of Skenderaj. It is in the Drenica region, about southwest of Mitrovica and northwest of Skenderaj (near the Skenderaj-Istog road). The site, one of the most prominent early Neolithic sites in Kosovo to date, contains artifacts from the Starcevo culture. It was excavated from 1966 to 1968 and again in 1984, and research was conducted in about 35 private parcels in the Dardania neighborhood of Runik. Starcevo and Vinca pottery fragments dating to 6500-3500 BC have been found here. A magnetic survey was conducted at the site in March 2010, and the remains of huts reinforced with wooden joists have been found. Monochrome pottery decorated with red gloss, Cardium pottery, barbotine earthenware and ceramic pottery painted with linear and geometric designs have been found, along with anthropomorphic figurines and cult tables (small altars). Ornamental artifacts include a spiral baked-clay vase tinted with ocher, painted in dark colors and decorated as the palm of a hand. A significant find is a baked-clay ocarina in length, known as the Runik Ocarina, the oldest musical instrument found in Kosovo to date.Berisha, p. 17.

Ethnic Albania theatre is based mostly on Albanian folk tradition, with Ottoman influences. Ethnic Serbian theatre tends to include more general Slavic influences, including Croatian and Slovenian influences, Russian and central Europe. The National Theatre of Kosovo is based in Pristina, while every city has its own theatre.  History  The National Theatre, in Pristina Scarce archaeological and historical data do not provide enough data for the basic information about theatre in Kosovo from the ancient period until nowadays. Ocarina, a spiritual instrument made of dust from the Neolithic era, is among the first evidence that shows that 3,500 years ago, in Dardania there might have been a stage-musical life. Funeral Dardan dances (4th-2nd centuries BCE) found in Dardania, show further evidence that in death rites there were used scenic elements. But the most relevant evidence that proves that in Ancient Dardania theatre had a prosperous life, is the \\"Actor‚Äôs Head\\" (2nd century BCE) discovered in Ulpiana. In the following ages (Early Middle Ages) in Kosovo, as well as in other countries, theatrical scenes were basically used for religious needs, but also as entertaining events most likely in a variety of traditional celebrations (theatre games in the villages during the winter seasons, preserved by nowadays). In the 19th and early on the 20th century, ordinary holidays or family partying in improvised environments such as porches or verandas of houses, surrounded by sheet carpets, were often followed by shows and plays (containing comics) containing songs and dances as well. The very first theatre in modern-day Kosovo was established in September 1945 in Prizren, with an ensemble of selected amateur actors from different cities of Kosovo. This theatre together with other institutions, in 1946 exceeded in Pristina, in an object which also exploited for screening of films, with a small stage that barely meets the basic requirements for a modest activity one. This building, established as a house of cultures, in 1948 became the theatre building. The first premier of this theatre was Suspicious Person by B. Nushqit. The text first staged in Albanian was Besa by Sami Frash√´ri, the premier of which took place during the season 1950/51. The theatre principal Milutin Jasniƒá, selected talented amateur actors from all Albanian territories to create successful plays and among them from Gjakova: Shani Pallaska, Shaban Domi; Vuƒçitrn: Abdurrahman and Meribane Shala; Kosovska Mitrovica: Muharrem Qena; Ferizaj: Katarina Josipi, Matej Serre√ßi; Peƒá: Istref Begolli. National Theatre of Kosovo (first named Regional Theatre and then Provincial People's Theatre) was founded in October 1946 in Prizren. This was the first professional theatrical institution in Kosovo after World War II. Very soon, a few months after its establishment, the theatre moved to the capital of Kosovo, Pristina.  Theatre in Prizren  Prizren Prizren has always been remarkable as the city where a variety of cultural events have been established. Theatre arts are an example of these cultural developments that had their start in Prizren, paving their way for success in other cities of Kosovo as well. Theatre arts in Prizren have started to develop around the 1880s, right after the first Albanian school was opened in 1878, when the first theatrical plays were most likely played by students in the first-opened schools. One of the first contributors that indicated the success of these plays were Mati Logoreci and Laz√´r Lumezi, both first instructors in Prizren schools, who worked diligently with the students. Among other theatrical organizations, the most famous one was founded in 1920 and was called Shoqnija Zonja Ndihm√´tare, which prepared its own plays also followed by a group of singers or choir. The evidences support the facts that Laz√´r Lumezi was the dramaturge for most of this organization's plays. One of such plays was the romantic play Gjenovefa e Brabanit (Brabani's Genovefa), which was inspired by the novel of Christopher Schmidt and showed vast success. Other plays performed by this organization were Gjykimi I t√´ pafajit (The innocent's Trial), Otavi dhe Silvestri (Otav and Silverster), Bardhi dhe Ferdinandi (Bardh and Ferdinand), Nato (Nato), Nata e Kshnellash (Christmas Night), Zefi I njoftun (The famous Zef), Barinjt√´ e Betlemit (Bethlehem's Shepherds), Dredhite a Shaptukut (Shaptuk's Dogdes), and Makaronat e Shejtanit (The Devil's Macaroni). Influenced by the current lifestyle in Kosovo, most of the plays had religious, heroic, and usually sad discourses. In holidays however, these plays were of an entertaining discourse, followed by traditional dances and songs. Other well-known organization that came up with brilliant plays were organization like Drita, Mehramet, Gajreti, and Ekipi Kulturor I Komitetit Shqiptar. During the World War II, theatrical plays started to face a higher development. During the year 1942, virtuous plays became known in almost every city of Kosovo and the public enjoyed them. Among such plays we can mention Kryengritja e Bajram Currit (Bajram Curri's Rebellion), Mrizi I Zanave (The Fairies Breeze), Tartufi (Tartuffe), Vllavrasja (Brother Murder) etc. This activity was a continuous work of the instructor Laz√´r Lumezi. The most famous actors that played in these shows were Framush Gomilla, Gjon Delhysa and Matej Vu“´aj. On 17 March 1949, the organisation called Komiteti I Rinis√´ Shqiptare decided to change its name into Shoq√´ria Kulturore-Artistike Agimi or SHKA Agimi, which brought to public some of the famous and hard- working artists whose talent will be remembered nowadays as well. The artists that were a part of this organisation were Krist√´ Berisha, Leze Spa“´i-Qena, Kol√´ B. Shiroka, Sefo Beto Krasniqi, Diana Vokshi, “™un Laj“´i, Bislim Mu“´aj and Bekim Fehmiu. In 1950, Prizren People's Council approved the decision of establishing the Amateur Theater of Prizren, and the preparation for different plays started immediately. The first plays were organized by Krist√´ Berisha, a well-known actor and director. One of the first and successful plays to be displayed by the group of this Theater was the play Urimi. The first actors that were a part of The Amateur Theater of Prizren were Krist√´ Berisha, Gjon Oroshi-Kola, Shaban Domi, Drita Dobroshi, Anton “™etta, Simon Krasniqi, Gjon Marku and many more. This group continued to work in The Amateur Theater until the foundation of the Professional Theater in Pristina.  Theatre in Gjakova  Gjakova Gjakova's theatre was founded on 24 December 1977 with an ensemble of actors and actresses that consisted of former amateurs who once had graduated from acting in the framework of the Higher Pedagogical School in Pristina. Since the beginning of the work until today, its activities, the theatre developed under the influence of the personality of the actor Hadi Shehu, which was the director and also a protagonist in the most important plays. The directors of Gjakova's theatre have been Serbian and Albanian as well, but among them we can mention the directors of the last three generations of Kosovo such as Muharrem Qena, Ekrem Kryeziu, Atdhe Gashi, Fetah Mehmeti, Fadil Hysaj, Agim Sopi, Selami Taraku, Luan Dhaka, Agim Selimi, Ilir Bokshi, Haqif Mulliqi, Esat Brajshori, Zana Hoxha, etc. It is also necessary to mention one of the main contributors for this theatre - Sulejman Lokaj (alb. Sulejman Lokaj), who worked as a principal as well as an actor in the theatre from 1976 to 1992. Gjakova is known for its actors who continue their work nowadays as well. Among them we can mention Hadi Shehu, Hysen Binaku, Ramazan Berkani, Qefsere Berkani, Myrvete Kurtishi, Jahja Shehu, Ahmet Bakija, Armond Morina (alb. Armond Morina), Kushtrim Hoxha (alb. Kushtrim Hoxha) etc.  Theatre in Peƒá  The theatre of Peƒá (or Professional Theatre) \\"Istref Begolli\\", is a centre for Peƒá professional artists, which operated for more than 60 years in Peƒá. Among the most famous artists who have contributed to the education of generations of this theatre are Abdurahman Shala, Istref Begolli, Faruk Begolli, Melihate Verse, Krista Berisha Malogami and Ragip Loxha. Performances who were prepared in the Theatre of Peƒá also participated in amateur Yugoslavian festival theatres. Among the most famous plays were Kulla e Hasim Bajraktarit (The tower of Hasim Bajraktari) and Nita by Josip Rela, also established as the best performances in Hvar, Croatia. Other outstanding performances in memory for the most successful plays are Dredhit√´ e Shaptukut (The tricks of Shaptukut), Hakmarrja (The Revenge) by Jusuf Kelemendi, Dila by Josip Rela, Shat√´ Shaljan√´t (The seven Shaljans), Valsin e kuq (Red Waltz) etc.  Oda Theater  ODA Theater (alb. Teatri Oda) was first opened from Lirak √áelaj (actor) and Florent Mehmeti (director) at the end of the year 2002. The first premiere Monologet e Vagines (Vagina's monologues) was shown on March1st 2003. Therefore, 1 March is known as the anniversary of this Theatre foundation. Oda Theatre is the only independent theatre in Kosovo with its own space. It is a regular member of the largest network of theatres in Europe called the Informal European Theater Meeting - IETM and Balkan Express Network (Balkan theatre network). In addition to performances, the main hall of Oda Theatre, are also used for different music concerts, film shows, promotions, recording of TV shows, TV serials, music videos and films.

Still, Hearst concludes: \\"For all the trials and tribulations that Percy faced in getting close to her man, the series remains compulsive viewing for all those who want to know what went on inside Russia for the last decade\\". After watching its first episode, the UK-based Soviet dissident Vladimir Bukovsky labelled the documentary \\"unequivocally pro-Putin\\". Writing on his blog on the Moscow radio station Ekho Moskvy website, Bukovsky went on to criticise the documentary as \\"nothing less than a party political broadcast for Putin and his United Russia party\\" and \\"an utter apology for Putin and his regime\\" before concluding that \\"if Putin had asked his propagandists to come up with a film they couldn't have done better\\". Bukovsky also talked of being mystified why BBC licence payers' money was spent on the film, and called for a UK parliamentary inquiry. Furthermore, Bukovsky addressed former Tony Blair's chief-of-staff Jonathan Powell admitting in the BBC documentary that the 'spy rock' found in a Moscow park had indeed been used by British intelligence officers and the subsequent inclusion of the admission in a documentary by Russian journalist Arkady Mamontov as follows: \\"I don't have any doubt that this is an FSB operation. They deftly used the BBC film to resurrect old propaganda just when mass demonstrations are going on in Moscow before the presidential election\\". =Russia= Much of the reaction to Putin, Russia and the West documentary in Russia concerned the new revelations by Jonathan Powell about the 'spy rock' episode from 2006. Andrei Illarionov, Putin's economic adviser turned political opponent, wrote on his LiveJournal blog: \\"This whole story is like a game in which the public only knows part of the information. And it looks like a game with players other than the Russian authorities\\". Journalist and popular blogger Anton Nosik went further on his LiveJournal blog, accusing the filmmakers of taking Russian state money through the PR agency Ketchum Inc., which has a contract to \\"improve the image of Russia in the West\\". Writing in The Moscow Times, the Sanoma-owned English language freesheet published in Moscow, Victor Davidoff has problems with the filmmakers' general political stance when it comes to Putin's Russia, which he feels follows the dominant theory among the leftist Westerners, that of \\"Putin's anti-democratic crusade largely being a legitimate reaction to the hostile policies of the West, especially the United States\\". Davidoff feels the documentary \\"bought into the Kremlin version of history: Putin came to power, put an end to the 'chaos of the 1990s,' took the country back from the oligarchs and gave Russians prosperity\\". Davidoff continues by comparing the current Western leftist support for Putin with their past support of Fidel Castro and Saddam Hussein: \\"You don't need conspiracy theories to explain this particular version of events. In the democratic West, there have always been people who have defended dictators, from Fidel Castro to Saddam Hussein. They didn't get paid from foreign bank accounts. They were simply left wing and anti-American\\".

The Act's purpose was to protect workers whose services are requisitioned outside their native states in India. Whenever an employer faces shortage of skills among the locally available workers, the act created provision to employ better skilled workers available outside the state. The act was replaced by the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020 Background The employment system of interstate migrant labour was an exploitative system prevalent more or less in all over India. It was rampantly institutionalized in Orissa and in some other states. In Orissa the migrant labour (called dadan labour locally) through contractors or agents (called Sardars / Khatedars) are sent for work outside the state in large construction projects. This system lends itself to various abuses. Sardar promising at the time of recruitment that wages would be calculated on piece rate basis would not be settled every month as promised. Once the worker came under clutches of the contractor he took him to a far off place on payment of railways fare only. No working hours were fixed for interstate migrant workers and they had to work on all the days in a week under extremely bad working conditions. Twenty eighth State Labour Ministers conference held on 21-10-1976 recommended for setting up of a small compact committee to examine all issues and suggest measures for eliminating the abuses prevalent in the interstate workers deployment. The compact committee which was constituted in February 1977, recommended the enactment of a separate central legislation to regulate the employment of interstate migrant workers as it was felt the provisions of the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act 1970, even after necessary amendments would not adequately take care of the variety of malpractices indulged in by the principal employers/contractors/Sardars/Khatedars etc. and the required facilities to be provided to these workmen in view of the peculiar circumstances in which they are working. The recommendations of compact committee had been examined in consultation with the state governments and the relevant central ministries, Interstate Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1979 was passed by both houses of Parliament and President of India gave his assent on 11-06-1979. This Act makes provision for availing with the onsite services of interstate workers by the contractors / establishments to overcome only the temporary shortage of required skilled workers in a state. The purpose of this act is not to encourage interstate migration of workers against the interests of local workers as the principal employers would have to incur more cost in deploying interstate workers. Contents=Rights of interstate workers= In addition to the general labour laws applicable to all workers, the interstate workers are entitled with *equal or better wages for the similar nature & duration of work applicable for the local workmen or stipulated minimum wages under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 whichever is more, *displacement allowance (Section 14), *home journey allowance (Section 15) including payment of wages during the period of journey, *suitable residential accommodation and medical facilities free of charge on mandatory basis. *Termination of employment after the contract period without any liability. *Right to lodge compliant with the authorities within three months of any incident, accident, etc. =Role of contractors= Registration of all contractors who employs or employed five or more Interstate Migrant Workmen on any day of the preceding 12 months. *Furnish the details of workmen periodically in such forms as prescribed by state government. *Maintain the registers indicating the details of interstate workers and make available for scrutiny by the statutory authorities. *Issue of passbook affixed with a passport-sized photograph of the workman indicating the name and the place of the establishment where the worker is employed, the period of employment, rates of wages, etc. to every inter-state migrant workman. *Reporting by the contractor the incidence of fatal accident or serious injury of such workman to the specified authorities of both the States and also the next of kin of the workman. *Liable for the prescribed punishments for violations committed under this Act. =Role of principal employers= *Registration of all principal employers who employs or employed directly or indirectly five or more Interstate Migrant Workmen on any day of the preceding 12 months. *Maintain the registers indicating the details of interstate workers and make available for scrutiny by the statutory authorities. *Every principal employer shall nominate a representative duly authorized by him to be present at the time of disbursement of wages by the contractor and it shall be the duty of such representative to certify the amounts paid as wages in such manner and may be prescribed. *Principal employer shall be liable to bear the wages and other benefits to interstate workers in case of failure by the contractor to effect the same. *Liable for the prescribed punishments for violations committed under this Act. =Role of state governments= *Appointment of inspectors to oversee implementation of this act. *Appointment of registration officers to grant and revoke registration of contractors / principal employers / establishments. *Appointment of licensing officers to grant, suspend and revoke licenses to contractors / principal employers / establishments *Making rules for carrying out the purposes of this Act subject to the condition of previous publication *Entertaining appeals from the aggrieved parties and disposal of the same as per this Act Actual implementation As per the census of the year 1991, nearly 20 million people migrated to other states seeking livelihood. Within a decade, the number of interstate migrants doubled to 41,166,265 persons as per the census figures of 2001. It is estimated that there are at present around 80 million migrants of which, 40 million are in the construction industry, 20 million are domestic workers, 12 million working in illegal mines otherwise called ‚Äúsmall scale quarries‚Äù, etc. Since the stipulations of this act are not implemented in true spirit by the state governments, more and more interstate workers are deployed in miserable working conditions at wages far below the prevailing local wages. The vested interest of labour departments in collusion with the principal employers /contractors is the main stumbling block to implement this act which is hurting the interests of the local workmen and the improvement in their living standards. Proposed amendment The Interstate Migrant Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Amendment Bill, 2011 is proposed to make this Act gender neutral by amending its title and replacing the word ‚Äòworkman and workmen‚Äô by the words ‚Äòworker and workers‚Äô respectively. However, the lawmakers have not thought of bringing additional provisions to implement this Act strictly with more accountability and punishments for violations. =Possible improvements= *All interstate workers should be registered in gram panchayat or municipality or corporation compulsory. *All interstate workers shall be provided with the benefits of Public Distribution System (PDS) Cards to avoid buying food grains and kerosene at higher prices. Adhar identity card shall be made compulsory for the interstate workers. *The remuneration to interstate workers shall be deposited in their bank accounts and not by cash by the contractors *Every state government shall mandatorily operate an internet portal indicating the registered principal employers, contractors, establishments and interstate workmen details including Adhar card data for general public information and verification. The details of interstate workmen shall be uploaded by the principal employers and contractors promptly. Non compliance by the principal employers or contractors is treated as violation of the Act and liable for punishment. *No contractor shall deploy the workers outside the state without getting registered in that state. All the details of the interstate workers deployment outside the state shall be made available to the state authorities promptly. *The state government authorities shall conduct mandatory yearly audit of all employers / contractors in a state regarding deployment of interstate workers and submit yearly compliance status or implementation report to the state assembly for their scrutiny. * The ongoing finance commission shall give weight age in devolution of central government funds to the states which are giving more employment to interstate workers as they are ahead in demographic transition. Demographic transition of a state is a real index & status of all round human and economical development. Social problems More and more interstate workers deployment is bringing social and cultural tensions in the states which are created on linguistic basis. Interstate workers being under the hold of their employers are scared of associating with local workers in ameliorating their living standards and working conditions. Many times interstate workers are reluctant to learn speaking in local majority language and to understand the local customs. Some times in the guise of interstate workers, interstate thieves / robbers / dacoits commit theft, murders, etc. creating law and order problems.

Below is a list of different settlements and tumuli, that have been excavated and studied, including some of the finds featured as pictures.Milot Berisha, Kosovo Archaeological Guide, Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, pp. 33‚Äì34. Settlements=Gadime e Ep√´rme= The archaeological site of Gradishta is situated on top of a plateau of the eponymous hill, set on the western part an area rich with minerals of Zhegoc Mountains. The fortress holds an extraordinary Geo-strategic position and it is a typical Copper Age and Iron Age mountainous settlement with fortified area characteristics. The fortress is situated on the eastern part of Gadime e Ep√´rme village. The site was archaeologically investigated during the 1973‚Äì1974, which resulted with the documented remains of the Copper Age, respectively the Bubanj Sallkuca‚ÄìKrivadol culture occupation. Also the fortress was reused during the Late Iron Age. Nevertheless, it is important to say that during the Eneolithic period, the fortress was reconstructed on several occasions and is very significant that discovered fragments of pottery decorated with the graffito technique and ornamented with the lacernation motifs, are most probably done by sharp tools. On the other hand, in the later phase of life continuation, during the later part of the Iron Age, several interesting fragments of imported Greek ware were discovered.Berisha, p. 35. =Hisar= The archaeological site, respectively the prehistoric settlement of Hisar, is situated on the southwestern part of town of Suhareka, set on a plateau dominating the wider flat terrain of the north side, situated between Suhareka in the north and Shiroka in the south, on the right side of the road from Suhareka to Prizren. The terrace is an elliptic flat area measuring in diameter 180 x 90 m and counting a total surface of approximately 1.1 ha, with the highest elevation recorded 422 m (above sea level). The first archaeological excavations were carried out in several seasons; 1961‚Äì1963, 1978 and again after two and half decades, the Archaeological Institute of Kosovo continued in two annual seasons in 2003‚Äì2004. The discovered archaeological material recorded at this site during the excavations, stretches from the Late Neolithic continuing until the Iron Age, which offers an overview for the study of the material culture of the autochthonous Dardanian population. Hisar presents a very important prehistoric civilization not only for Kosovo, but for the entire Balkans, too. The site is proof of a flourished town from the Copper Age.Berisha, p. 36. Of the eleven stratigraphic layers the earliest is from the late Neolithic Age, progressing as a settlement all the way until the layer called Hisar VI of the Late Antiquity (4th-6th centuries AD). According to this chronological scheme the earliest phase of habitation in Hisar must be connected with the Reshtan phase of the Adriatic Late Neolithic.P√´rzhita, et al., p. 30. =Gllareva= The archaeological site of Gllareva is situated at the central part of the Gllareva village, Klina Municipality, situated on the right side of the Prishtina-Peja road, stretched on the fields of Rigjeva. This archaeological site was identified accidentally in 1973. The archaeological excavations conducted here in the 80s, were focused in two locations, not far from each other. Both sites were recorded as necropolises with two different burial rites. One of the necropolises is typical for flat burials constructed with stone plates, whereas the bases were covered with gravel, and the other necropolis was typical with incarnation ritual, respectively the cremation burial. Nevertheless, the inhumation rite is predominant, where out of 48 graves in tumuli I and II, only 3 are cremations.Luan P√´rzhita, et al., p. 34. In the chronological aspect, both sites were dated to the Late Bronze Age. Amid many excavated/researched burials, besides abundant archaeological material discovered there, which were documented and recorded as the grave goods, of which, the most particular were several bronze coated swords and daggers, typical for Mycenaean culture recorded at this location. This clearly indicates the exchange and consolidated contacts between the ancient centers of the Greek world, and informs us about the established communication links among the intertribal societies of the Balkan tribes.Berisha, pp. 39‚Äì40. =Boka e P√´r√ßev√´s= Illyrian tombs in Boka-P√´r√ßeva The Boka e P√´r√ßev√´s tumulus necropolis is situated few kilometers up northwest from the Gllareva necropolis. This grouped tumulus burial is dated in Late Bronze and Early Iron Period, and is very characteristic for the huge number of the dispersed burial mounds within a wider complex area. In total, 19 burial mounds were detected where, among them, only seven were excavated and researched during the 1970s. Rich and abundant archaeological material in the form of grave goods were discovered here, whereas, tooled weapons, different decorations and diverse qualitative vessels and earth ware pots, all together clearly reflect the undisputed facts of the remains of an advanced indigenous Dardanian civilization.Berisha, p. 41. =Rogov√´= The tumuli necropolis of Rogova, situated at the location known locally as the Fusha (Field), is set around 4 km southeast from the tumuli necropolis of Fshej, located on the right side of the Gjakova-Prizren road. This necropolis complex comprises 6 burial mounds, mainly in good condition and some of them where quite damaged. The site was investigated for the first time in 1966 and then again in several other occasions in 1973, 2005 and lately in 2011. All previous researches resulted with the same outcome confirming the traces of a group of the tumulus which is based on the discovered movable archeological material dating in the Middle Bronze Age (1800‚Äì1500 BC). Nevertheless, the site was reused also during the Early Iron Age, again as a necropolis. The researched burials contained very rich grave goods, which according to the researchers, were stored in the graves together with the buried persons. The grave goods were personal objects or belongings of the deceased, in most case, either, weapons, decorations, and other personal possessions of not ordinary persons.Berisha, pp. 42‚Äì43. =Korish√´= The Bronze Age site of Korisha, was investigated in 2006, research excavations carried out through trial trenches. The site is situated on the eastern slope of the horse-saddle shaped hill near the Korisha antique castle. The settlement measures an approximate area of 1 hectare, with the highest elevation point recording 728 meter, and the lowest 723 meters above the sea level. The settlement was a typical fortified site, protected by nature in one side, and traverses on the other sides. The archaeological test excavations carried out at this locality at two sections, resulted with the documentation of typical Bronze Age dwellings, confirming the life continuity during the early and middle Bronze Period. Among the discovered movable archaeological material, the most worth mentioning ones are; stone tooled utensils, fragments of various earthenware and other smaller findings, typical for this period.Berisha, p. 44. =B√´rnic√´ e Poshtme= Reconstruction of a Bronze Age house from the locality Hisar The researched Late Bronze and Early Iron Age site of the B√´rnica e Poshtme, is situated around 5 kilometers north of Prishtina, stretched along the Prishtina-Podujeva (Besiana) road. This is a typical flat necropolis whereas the cremation urn burial was practiced. The ashes of the deceased were stored in urns and buried inside either individual or group graves in flatten areas, that in the archaeological literature is known as the 'urn-fields necropolis'. Based on the results of research discovered material from this burial complex, a particular method of grave construction was recorded. The stone tholoid plates were set in the shape of a semicircular grave base. The urn-field burials were investigated in the 1980s, after an accidental finding of an urn. Nevertheless, since the discovery of this flat necropolis, this archaeological culture was named the B√´rnica e Poshtme/Donja Brnica Culture.Berisha, p. 45. =Ponoshec= The tumulus necropolis of Ponoshec is situated at the locality known by the locals as Ar√´za, stretched in several parcels in around 5-6ha area, close to the river flow of the Labenica creek. The tumulus necropolis is composed by a grouped burial mounds; five of them were identified so far. In general, the tumulus measure between 12 and 18 m in diameter and the maximum height of the burial mounds goes up to 1 meter of elevation. The rescue excavations carried out during the 2011 season resulted with abundant discoveries of the grave goods with typical characteristics of the Iron Age Illyrian tumulus. Nevertheless, the study of the movable material as recorded here, proved interesting outcome on the site chronology and material culture, confirming the occupancy continuity from Bronze and particularly during the Iron Age. Nevertheless, the burial mounds were effectively reshaped in the 12th-10th century BC, and then again reused during the 6th and 4th century BC, a time period known as the Dardanian Antiquity.Berisha, p. 46. =Gjinoc= The Gjinoc burial mound (Illyrian tumulus), is a unique case of tumuluses recorded in Kosovo. The overall diameter of the tumulus measures: 84 meters running toward east-west and 73 meters running toward north-south. The highest elevation of the tumulus measures almost 10 meters and tumulus was not yet scientifically researched. Nevertheless, based on the overall dimensions, the tumulus construction, height and setting, most probably the burial mound was constructed during the Late Iron Age of the Dardanian antiquity. Moreover, when taking into consideration the overall facts, it might be stated that the giant tumulus grave was constructed for a very important family with a high social status.Berisha, p. 47. =Bella√ßec= The Bella√ßec (Bardh i Madh) prehistoric fortress is situated on top of a low hill, a naturally protected terrain configuration from north, south and east, in one hand, and the traverse and ditch barriers from the western part, which made this fortified settlement an important stronghold for its time. Additionally, the Drenica River flows below the foot of the hill, whereas few meters up north, the √ái√ßavica Mountains encircle the surrounding landscape. The ancient fortress is in the trapezoidal shape, measuring 70x50 meters inside the fort, while, the exterior surrounding is characterized by rows of traverses composed of mixed earth and river stones. This extraordinary strategic geographical position of the fortress was ideal for the inhabitants to observe a wide zone of the Fush√´ Kosovo region. The excavations confirmed occupancy evidenced based on the discovered material, which were unearthed after more than 28 centuries. The earthenware finds are mainly decorated with caneluras and dots, typical for the Dardanian decoration style of the Dardanian antiquity, respectively the late Iron Age, this also confirming the local and regional pottery production. The archaeological excavations carried on this site, mainly in the form of trial trenches at this site conducted in several seasons since the end of the sixties of the past century to continue up to present year. In 2011, a geophysical survey conducted with the geomagnetic device, has recorded underground features of the fort's compounds, premises which will come under the light through future excavations. The site occupancy was active during the 8th up to the 5th century BC.Berisha, p. 48. =Fshej= The Fshej tumulus necropolis belongs to the Late Iron Period (7th ‚Äì 6th centuries BC). During the archaeological excavations carried out here in 2011, five tumulus burials were archaeologically excavated and researched, which resulted with rich and abundant archaeological material, typical for determination of the chronology of the site, which clearly confirms the occupancy of the Dardanian population, respectively the time period of the unification of their ethoculture. The burial mound group is situated approximately 800m south, southwest from the Ura e Shenjt√´ stone bridge. The funerary rite practiced here, the inhumation or free burial of the deceased buried inside a burial constructed as a grave case built with river stone graves, illustrates one of the burial rites of the indigenous population. Besides, the inhumation ritual practiced by the Dardanians, the incarnation/cremation of the late person was widely used in Dardania.Berisha, p. 49. =Llashtic√´= The Illyrian Llashtica burial mounds necropolis The Llashtica burial mounds are situated approximately 10 km northeast from the Gjilan, set on the left bank of the Morava e Bin√ß√´s River, stretched in a wider area of the agricultural fields of Llashtica village and bordering with the mountains of Karadak. Nine burial mounds were recorded so far, all characteristic for the Late Iron Age. Approximately, 1.5 km north from this site, a flat settlement was researched through scan excavations carried out in 2011, confirming the same occupancy period with the mounds, respectively the Late Iron Period. Nevertheless, the archaeological researches‚Äô were carried out in several seasons at the Llashtica tumulus site commencing in 1980, 1981 and 1982, whereas, five burial mounds were excavated up to the geological layer. In 2011, a tumulus known as number VIII was excavated in two segments. On the other hand, as stated earlier above, the Iron Age settlement researched in 2011 offered an overview of the past society while the burial and settlement complemented the information of the indigenous population. In regard, wealthy archaeological movable objects discovered here, different in form and material as for example the earthenware, jars, plates and jewelry (fibulas, bracelets, necklaces, etc.) and on the other hand, fragmented cult figures with bird motifs coated on bronze, all clearly an overview of a vivid reflection of the Iron period civilization. One of the burial mounds (tumulus VIII), which is in a relatively good condition, measures in dimensions; 32 x 32m in diameter, whereas the height of the tumulus survived up to 1.60 meter. The archaeological excavations revealed remains of the deceased who was cremated and ashes most probably scattered. The tumulus necropolis is dated in the Late Iron Period.Berisha, p. 50. =Shiroka= Shiroka group burial mounds situated near the Shiroka village, situated around 1.5 km south of town of Suhareka (Theranda), stretches on the right side of the road. The Dardanian cultural group of the tumulus, characteristic for the construction type with circle shaped graves, built by a mixture of earth and river stones, was identified at this site in 1953 by I.Nikolic, a worker of the Kosovo Museum. The excavations happened because some villagers of Shiroka had discovered some archaeological articles while planting their grape vines.P√´rzhita, et al., p. 89. Not far from this locality, a multilayer site of Hisar in one side and the Dubi√ßak burial mounds in the other side are situated. The past archaeological excavations carried here, resulted with the remains of a necropolis of the Bronze Age date and reused during the Late Iron Age. The discovered movable archaeological material composed of abundant and particular findings distinctive for the ornamented and decorated earthenware, most likely indicate that the vessels were imported and came through the trade and exchange from the Hellenic world and beyond. The necropolis of Shiroka, was erected during the 8th‚Äì6th century BC.Berisha, p. 51. In 1963 excavations were continued by J.Todorovic, when he dug out two of the eight tumuli of the Shiroka Necropolis, dating from the same period‚Äîi.e., 8th-6th century BC. The first tumulus had a diameter of 13m, height of 0.75m. It contained 5 graves with cremation, and in inventory of ceramic pottery and bronze ornaments. The second tumulus had a diameter of 12 m, height of 0.75m. It contained 6 graves with cremation, and inventory of ceramic pottery and iron weapons. From the evidence it was concluded that they belong to the Dardanian/Illyrian tradition of tumuli.P√´rzhita, et al., p. 89. =Lubozhda= The village of Lubozhda is situated west from the town of Istog and the place is characteristic for the recorded archaeological site known by the toponomy Livadhi, set only few hundred meters on the left side of the road. Several burial mounds are stretched at this area, typical for the Iron Age, a period of the formation of the Illyrian ethnical and cultural identity, a population that has inhabited the entire Illyrian peninsula (the present Balkans) and beyond. The discovery of a very rich grave inventory within one of the tumulus graves, with a collection of jewelry (silver coated bracelets, etc.) clearly illustrates the fact that it did belong to a distinguished dignitary buried at this site. Nevertheless, the grave goods were dated to sometime between the 6th and 5th century BC. Only 7 km from this site an archaeological site of the Banja e Pej√´s of the same date is found. Also from the analogy of the composition of the archaeological material, the similarity is evident. Therefore, there must have been a link between both sites or they even belonged to the same entity. The geophysical prospection carried at this area during the 2011, identified several tumulus graves which are not visible from the visual observation of the terrain.Berisha, p. 52. =Banja e Pej√´s= Ancient archaeological site of Banja e Pej√´s, situated in the crossroad that links Peja with Istog, is only 12 km northwest from Peja. During the construction period of Onyx hotel in 1974, a typical Illyrian military helmet was discovered accidentally. Apropos, the archaeological rescue excavations commenced at this site that resulted with abundant movable archeological material being discovered, while among the most important ones uncovered features a grave of an important pair of people that was named by the archeologists as The Royal Tomb.P√´rzhita, et al., p. 115. The couple's grave was constructed in the rectangular shape base and built with tuff stone plates, most probably extracted from the neighboring quarry. The recorded female grave contained rich grave goods material for example; fibula, omega shape needles, a ring and necklace decorated with geometrical motifs, forged in silver and bronze. On the other hand, the male burial grave contained the grave goods, personal belongings composed of; weapons, silver and bronze jewelry. The archaeological documentation of these important and valuable findings, among others, offers a picture of the time, characteristic for the social and economical differentiation of individuals or groups. Rich archaeological material discovered at this site belongs to the Late Iron Age, 6th-5th century BC. Surrounding micro region is rich on site and off site findings of different periods, confirming the continuity and occupancy of these most probably due to the great life conditions when having in mind the thermal water sources near this site. On the other hand, the landscape and geostrategic favorable position were ideal for selection of this locality to be inhabited during the long time period.Berisha, pp. 53‚Äì54. =Prizren= Menada of Prizren is a bronze figure of a running girl, about 520-500 BC, Found at Prizren, (now Kosovo, Winning at the ancient Games, British Museum A distinctive chance finding of a very particular artifact, discovered somewhere in Prizren, sometime during the second part of the 19th century; presents a unique exhibit of a bronze cast statue with a figure of a female athlete on the run. This masterpiece is also known as the Prizren Maenad. The bronze statuette has a height of 11.4 cm and could‚Äôve been a part of an ornament affixed in a decorative vessel. The statuette is dated between 520‚Äì500 BC, probably made during the Archaic Greek Period. Nowadays, this unique artefact belongs to the British Museum, respectively to the Greek & Roman Antiquities Collection, since it was sold in 1876, by an antiquarian trader called Seraphim, believed to be of Armenian origin. The bronze caste statuette is on the 'move' (run), with her body turned to the front, looking down to her right and holding up her skirt in her left hand. She wears a short skirt with fold falling from right shoulder and exposing her right breast, while her hair falls back in parallel waves behind. The Prizren runner (female athlete) is an artefact most likely imported from Greek Sparta.Berisha, p. 55. Another different and rare finding which is almost special as the Prizren runner is the bronze statuette of a seated goat of the 6th century BC. According to the written sources, this figurine was discovered accidentally in 1939, somewhere in Jaglenica, suburban part of Prizren. The figurine measures a length of 6.5 cm and is about 3 cm wide and of 6.5 cm high, with the weight of only 380 grams. The bronze statuette of the sitting goat is exposed at Vranje Museum.Berisha, p. 55. =Kamenica Stelae= A carved relief showing a funeral procession scene, that reflects a funeral of a man, whose coffin is followed by what appears to be his wife in front of the procession, was accidentally discovered at the Kamenica fort area, respectively at the southern part at the bottom of the fort's hill. Most probably, the engraved funerary scene is a creation modeled during the Classical Period (5th‚Äì4th century BC), however, it might be also a late work carried during the Hellenistic Period (4th‚Äì1st century BC). Nevertheless, the carved procession scene resembles to a mourning organized rite of mass mourning, practiced in organized group manner following the cortege with grief and sorrow, a ritual still practiced in the mountainous region of Mal√´sia e Gjakov√´s, which on the other hand, can be treated as the spiritual heritage existing still nowadays. From other point of view, when carefully observing the female mourner's figures of this funerary ceremony, it is clear that they wear dresses that resemble with Illyrian xhubleta gown in the shape of campanile, which might be argued that there is likeness with the typical autochthones woman dress most probably used since the Bronze Age and still worn in the mountainous and distant rural parts inhabited by Albanians. The engraved (Fragmented) stelea is exhibited at the lapidarium of the Archaeological Park of the Kosovo Museum. As for the Illyrian dress, a typical local modern era xhubleta gown is exhibited at the exhibition room of the Ethnographical Museum 'Emin Gjiku' in Pristina.Berisha, p. 56. Kamenica Stelae.

The train was designed by Barrie Masterton, with the twelve dedicated coaches being converted at the Cardiff Cathays works. The Travelling College was the only train of its kind in the World, with provision for up to 160 students. The train was finished in cream with chocolate brown and red bands, along with white roofs.Travelling College It was operated under a contract with the InterCity Charter section and based at Old Oak Common TMD. The entire train was withdrawn and purchased by the Bluebell Railway in 1993.A mixed bag: The BR Mk.Is Concept With the launch of the GCSE examinations requiring a considerable amount of learning to take place outside of the classroom it was hoped that the Travelling College would provide means for the classroom and associated accommodation to be taken to suitable locations, essentially creating a mobile field study centre. The service was launched by the Princess of Wales on 2 May 1989, with a brass plaque being unveiled in saloon TCL991868. In the event, however, government legislation on course organisation and funding of external activities meant that the College was not available for the majority of state schools. Rolling stock Dereham Twelve British Railways Mark1 coaches were converted for use on the train. Six were converted to serve as dormitory coaches, two staff coaches, three classrooms and one meeting coach. An additional standard restaurant car was provided.

Nuclear tests were conducted at the site in October 2006, May 2009, February 2013, January 2016, September 2016, and September 2017.  Geography  The site has three visible tunnel entrances. Based on satellite imagery, its exact location is in mountainous terrain in Kilju County, North Hamgyong Province. It is south of Mantapsan, west of Hwasong concentration camp and northwest of the Punggye-ri village. The most proximate settlement to the possible nuclear underground test site is Chik-tong, a small populated place located at . Sungjibaegam is a settlement located from the tremor of the 2013 test. Punggye-ri railway station is located at .  History  In January 2013, Google Maps was updated to include various locations in North Korea. On 8 April 2013, it was reported that South Korea had observed activity at Punggye-ri, suggesting that a fourth nuclear test was being prepared, but the next test did not occur until January 2016. On 6 January 2016, North Korean state media announced a fourth nuclear test had been carried out successfully at the location using a hydrogen bomb. Satellite imagery captured for monitoring website 38 North between January and April 2017 suggested that a sixth nuclear test was being prepared at the site, which was detonated on 3 September 2017. According to sources, people from the Punggye-ri nuclear test site have been banned from entering Pyongyang since the test due to the possibility of being radioactively contaminated. According to the report of defectors, about 80% of trees died and all of the underground wells dried up in the site after the sixth nuclear test. On 3 and 23 September 2017, earthquakes which seem to be collapses of tunnels were detected with magnitude of 4.1 and 3.6 respectively. A 17 October 2017 study published by the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University suggested the most recent test had caused \\"substantial damage to the existing tunnel network under Mount Mantap\\". On 30 October 2017, in testimony before the South Korean parliament, the director of South Korea's Meteorological Administration warned that \\"further tests at Punggye-ri could cause the mountain to collapse and release radioactivity into the environment.\\" Likewise, Chinese scientists warned that if the mountain collapsed, nuclear fallout could spread across \\"an entire hemisphere.\\" On 1 November 2017 Japanese TV station TV Asahi reported that according to unconfirmed reports, several tunnels collapsed at the test site on 10 October 2017. An initial collapse was said to have killed 100 workers, with another 100 rescuers killed in a second collapse. On 20 April 2018 the North Korean government announced that it would suspend nuclear tests and shut down the Punggye-ri nuclear test site. On 14 May 2018 it was reported that commercial satellite imagery indicated that dismantling of the facilities at the test site had begun. The leader and Supreme Commander of North Korea Kim Jong-un determined the date for the closing ceremony of Punggye-ri - 23-25 May 2018. The government of North Korea allowed a handful of international journalists (but none from South Korea) to observe the closing ceremony. Notably absent would be experts or inspectors who could study the test site at close quarters. On 24 May 2018 foreign journalists reported that tunnels in the Punggye-ri nuclear test site had been destroyed by the North Korean government in a move to reduce regional tensions. = International observations = On 31 October 2018, Kim Min-ki, a lawmaker in South Korea's ruling Democratic Party, stated that now defunct Punggye-ri was among other nuclear and missile test sites which had been observed by officials from South Korea's National Intelligence Service and that it was now ready for planned international inspection.

Dardania fell under Roman occupation in the first century AD, one of the last territories of Illyria to succumb. Being that Dardania had and today Kosovo has a central position between the road networks that connected the south Aegean with the Danube basin, and with the Adriatic Sea, it was a strategic jewel. It also was important for the Romans due to its rich mineral resources, which they exploited and benefited from. We see that most of the towns of ancient Dardania are located either close to a mine, or close to a road. The Dardanian identity has been disputed for a while, and it is known that it was distinctive, similar to the Illyrian, and also with a Roman or Thracian twist to it, due to the occupation and co- habitation. The archaeological surveys and studies of the last century are helping to establish this Dardanian identity in an objective manner, which will lead to a clearer study and explanation of the continuity of culture in this so much disputed region. Below is a listing of the prominent settlements during the Roman period and an explanation of what they were, when they were inhabited, and when they were founded, accompanied by an array of pictures that illustrate the archaeological finds and remnants. Sites *Municipium DardanorumPannonia and Upper Moesia or DardanicumThe Illyrians by J. J. Wilkes, 1992, , p. 258,\\"In the south the new city named municipium Dardanicum, was another 'mining town' connected with the local workings (Metalla Dardanica).\\" is located in North Kosovo, approximately 27 kilometres north of Mitrovica, in the village of Soƒçanica, Leposaviƒá municipality. It existed as a prehistoric settlement at first, but continued to develop and change to become a typical ancient Roman town during the period from the last decades of the 1st century, until the first part of the 4th century AD. The site stretches in approximately 30 hectares.Milot Berisha, Kosovo Archaeological Guide,Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.61.Emil Cerskov, Municipium DD kod Socanice (Dissertationes et monographiae), Museum of Kosovo, Archaeological Society of Yugoslavia, Prishtine-Belgrade, 1970. *Ulpiana was a Roman town, established in the 1st century AD, receiving municipium status in 169 AD. It was located near a rich mining area and also had a geo-strategic position situated close to the ancient crossroads that linked east with west, were dominant factors for the foundation, development and existence through centuries. During the Roman era, Ulpiana was one of the most active and frequented centers connecting Constantinople with Rome, and close to the town the crossroad connecting the Adriatic with the Aegean coasts, even indirectly with the Black Sea. Furthermore, the existence of the ancient communication route Via Lissus- Naissus is known; land communication networks passed close to Ulpiana. The earliest forms of occupation (human activity and civilization) date to the prehistoric period, but especially highlighted by archaeologists are the Bronze and Iron Ages. Nevertheless, the first forms of an urban centre recorded in Ulpiana date to the beginning of Roman rule, which occurred in the first century AD. With Romans settled, Ulpiana developed from a small, ancient Dardanian concentrated oppidum to a widespread territory with all attributes of a typical Roman town organization. In regard to this matter, it is believed that Ulpiana was established as a Roman municipium in 169 AD, called Municipium Ulpianum. Nonetheless, Ulpiana achieved its peak of development during the 3rd and 4th century; a period when it became a very important political, economical, cultural center of a wider area of the territory of Dardania, but also became the crucial center for the expansion of the ancient civilization in this region. The Roman town of Ulpiana during this period was ascribed as the Municipum Ulpiana Splendidissima ‚Äì the Splendid City of Ulpiana, characterized with road networks, an orthogonal construction system, a water supply, drainage, houses, buildings and various other public, sacral, profane and utilitarian buildings. In addition, the Municipium of Ulpiana was a very important trading centre of either metallurgical artisans or agricultural goods and merchandise for at least the first five centuries of the first millennium, and especially during the rule of Byzantine emperor Justinian the Great in the 6th century AD - a time when Ulpiana was rebuilt and renamed to Justiniana Secunda. Since the second part of the 20th century, the ancient town of Ulpiana has been in a continuity study through the loupe and pickaxe of either local or foreign archaeologists that have contributed until present day with the discovery of a few cult and sacral monuments: a basilica and necropolis, as well as parts of ramparts with watchtowers, castrum - Roman military garrison and hundreds of movable artifacts, different in form, material and usage, as well as human remains, architectural structures and elements, all testimony of the cultural material very important for the scientific field of archaeology. The gathered data was partially studied and is under the process of systematic evaluation from various specialists of different scientific disciplines that all together contribute for the further update of the archaeological data. The site went through elaborate research studies with highly sophisticated investigative devices, which are completely non-intrusive methods of survey examination. Appreciating the cooperation, the German Archaeological Institute and the Archaeological Institute of Kosovo have jointly participated in geophysical prospecting with advanced survey/recording methods. For example: a fluxgate magnetometer, gradiometer and georadar connected with GIS, surveying around 50 hectares of land with archaeological potential within the Ulpiana area. Besides the scientific character, the underneath earth recording will aid with future pacifications and development plans for the archaeological site. In addition, the site will also benefit from a management plan for a compilation of the development plans for the promotion of the cultural heritage known as archaeotourism, which as a precondition requires a setting of tourist infrastructure at the archaeological sites. On the other hand, these advanced methods and techniques will also help on the determination of the extent of character and nature of Ulpiana, while keeping in mind that it is a multilayer site.Milot Berisha, Kosovo Archaeological Guide,Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.69-71. *Statio Vindenis was among three road stations that were constructed in Dardania during Roman rule. This archaeological site is located in the village of Glavnik, Podujevo municipality, approximately 5 km southeast from the town of Podujevo. The ancient Via Lissus-Naissus Roman road was a diagonal route, connecting the central Balkans region with the Adriatic coast, passing through Vindenis. The settlement and Roman road station of Vindenis are stretched on the right bank of Llap River vicinity, measuring an area of more or less of 15-20 hectares.Milot Berisha, Kosovo Archaeological Guide,Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.62. *The site of Pestova is located in the municipality of Vuƒçitrn, discovered in 2005.

Kosovo has an abundance of multicultural and rich heritage dating back to the Bronze Age, later followed by Illyrians, Roman, Byzantine/Serbian Orthodox and Ottoman periods. Most of the monuments in Kosovo were built by local craftsmen's with local materials under conditions that were influenced by the empires that invaded Kosovo. Monuments that still stand are those of the Byzantine/Serbian Orthodox and Ottoman periods, which have historical, cultural, architectural and artistic values for our priceless legacy. Among the antique cities, Byzantine and Orthodox churches and monasteries, Ottoman Mosques, Hamams and Bazaars thrived the building culture of the common people ‚Äì the residential dwelling. Kosovo's monuments are unique common property for which the society is responsible to maintain them in order to transmit their authenticity to future generations. The field of popular architecture has value upon indigenous features that are considered to have one of the most original constructive structures in the whole Balkan. Kosovo has a strategic geographical position, since through Kosovo's territory natural traffic lines and roads passed which had an importance for cultural movements, heritage, historical, and art developments. During the last war in 1998-1999, more than 500 monuments were systematically targeted by the state forces, where more than 80% of them were destroyed, burnt or damaged. In many of them, only the construction walls have remained. UNESCO has classified Kosovo's monuments as Serbo-Byzantine monuments, Islamic monuments of the Ottoman Period and Vernacular architecture.  Mediaeval monuments  In the sixth century Justinian I, himself of Dardanian origin, reasserted Byzantine control over Dardania after the Hunnish invasions and engaged in an extensive building/rebuilding programme in the region. From 839 to the early thirteenth century the region fell under Bulgarian control, with intermittent periods when the Byzantines were able to reassert their rule. From the early thirteenth century, until 1355, Kosovo was part of the Serbian Empire under the Nemanjiƒá dynasty; and it was in this period that most existing mediaeval Christian buildings were built.

However, many historical evidences show that the first encounters of Islam with the Balkans happened well before the arrival of the Ottomans and their establishment in the Balkans. Because of its proximity to the centers of Islam, i.e., Middle East, the Byzantine Empire and parts of the Balkans, including the Albanian territories and Kosovo as well, were exposed to Islam as early as in the 8th century. Moreover, the geographical position of the Balkans enabled its people to be exposed to different missionary activities, as well as trade and military encounters. Thus, the first contacts of the Albanian territories with Islam date back to the pre-Ottoman medieval period. Nevertheless, the process of Albanian transfer to Islam began and was completed during the Ottoman Era, and thus main Islamic monuments in the country appeared during the Ottoman and after Ottoman period. History The Balkans were part of the Roman Empire, part of the Bulgarian empire, and the Byzantine Empire until the late Middle Ages, when the Ottoman Turks overruled and gradually took control of almost the entire peninsula. Islam was introduced to Europe mainly through the two major peninsulas, Iberia and the Balkans. With influences from Muslim Spain (Andalusia) from the west, the Mediterranean coast and Sicily from the south, and Muslim Pechengs of Hungary from the north-east, Islam penetrated easily even to the most inner parts of the Balkans. Furthermore, the well known Muslim geographer, historian, and cartographer Al Idrƒ´sƒ´ during the 12th century (1154) provided valuable information on a journey inland from the Albanian port of Durr√´s towards Constantinople through Thessaloniki, offering some interesting references to the lakes on the Kosovo-Macedonia border as important crossing points, with Ohrid as the most important. These connections though predominantly for trade and commerce also had left other impact on life in the Balkans. Because of Muslim fairness in their dealings and their advanced system and ideas, many individuals chose Islam to be their faith. At the same time, many Muslim merchants found good accommodations in the coastal cities, fertile valleys, crossroad towns or fortifications, and so settled there. Thus, the first small Muslim settlements emerged, which grew and influenced how people dressed, measured time, cooked food. According to Thomas Arnold, the first introduction of Islam in South-Eastern Europe was the work of a Muslim jurist-consul, who was taken as a prisoner, probably in one of the wars between the Byzantine Empire and its Muslim neighbors, and was taken to the country of the Pechengs at the beginning of the 11th century. The prisoner explained to them the main tenets of Islam, and, therefore many of them embraced Islam. Thus, well before the end of the 11th century, Islam began to spread among them, and almost all Pechengs became Muslim. The migrations of people within the Balkan countries as well as outside arrivals played an important role in the spread of Islam. Some of these migrations had religious and missionary purposes. For instance, the traveling of Sari Saltuq, an ecstatic Sufi devotee mentioned even by the great Ibn Battuta in 1332‚Äì1334, was well known among the Balkan people. Specific towns and specific topographical localities are associated with his story. He, furthermore, has various tombs in different countries in the Balkan Peninsula. Thus, as early as the 13th and especially during the 14th century, many mystic and nomad imams groups appeared in the Christian countries, where they propagated their faith and helped people to get more knowledge about Islam. =Introduction of Islam= The most important migration for the region was that of the Al-Aga family, from Aleppo, Syria. Some members of this family migrated to Kosovo beginning from 1095 while the others came at the end of 1291 and settled in a local village. They had built a mosque there, which exists to the present day, and it is going to further be explored in this article later on. From the above description, based on mentioned facts, it can be concluded that the first encounters of the Balkan people, including Kosovo, with Islam were much earlier than the arrival of the Ottomans. These first contacts may have taken place as early as the beginning of the 8th century in the Balkans in general, and they became more frequent in the 9th and 10th centuries among the Slavs and Albanians. Afterwards, they increased greatly during the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries. In other words, Kosovos' encounters with other parts of the world, particularly the Muslim world, were not mainly due to and through Ottoman occupation and siege, but there were natural human migrations and cultural fusions intertwined as a result of trade, marriages and other human relations gradually occurinv. Islam was not totally enforced in law, as is often claimed, but through more so a long historical process which played out in associated with many benefits, especially for those who sought great careers within the Ottoman Empire. Despite claims that might rise about radicalism or radicals movements in Kosovo, however, the presence of many international, mainly European, organizations hold that Kosovo Muslims do not define their national identity through religion, but through language and have a relatively relaxed approach towards the observance of the forms of Islam. And the following available information show that Islamic monuments were present in Kosovo well before the Ottomans. =Monuments in Kosovo before the Ottoman era= As earlier mentioned, Islam was introduced to Kosovo quite long before the Ottomans. However, there is yet research to be done regarding Islamic monuments before the Ottomans in Kosovo. Nevertheless, Kosovo, as many other countries in the Balkans, were primarily Christian during the pre- Ottoman period. Thus, claims may be raised about Kosovo as the cradle of Christianity, namely orthodox civilization, because of few monuments of the 14th century and few others of the 15th century being found in the country. Moreover, Kosovo is often depicted as a flourishing center of Eastern orthodoxy during the late medieval period, yet with the arrival of the Ottomans this flourishing became calamity because the Ottomans either inadvertently destroyed those monuments or turned them into Islamic/Ottoman ones. However, looking into Kosovo today one cannot deny the presence of Christian shrines and monuments, both catholic and orthodox aside, however, recent data show that Kosovo before the Ottomans was not the home of Christians alone but it was also a home of Bogomils, Muslims, Jews etc. In this regard, these data show that migration as a natural process occurred in different periods of history because different people moved here and there seeking better opportunities or better places to live. As in many parts in the world such migrations happened to Kosovo, too. In 1095 a Muslim family from Aleppo city, present day Syria, migrated to Kosovo and settled there. This seems to be a big family and they migrated in different periods from 1095 until 1291, they settled in the southern part of Kosovo in the present-day Draga≈° municipality. Since keeping the prayers (salat) is one of the tenets of Islam, Muslims need to have mosques in order to keep the weekly (Juma) prayer. Obviously, this family after settling in the country and getting together the other members of the family, they seemed to be liking the country and made long terms plan of staying there. As a result, in 1289, they built a small mosque for their household needs and the mosque, most probably, is named after the householder‚Äôs name Ahmed Al-Aga. This is the first mosque in Kosovo at least 100 years before the Ottoman arrival in Kosovo and the well-known battle of Kosovo in 1389. =Monuments of the Ottoman era= Once conquering the Balkans the Ottomans established their administration and began to shape the conquered territories according to their culture and traditions. Mosques, hamams (public baths) and madrasas (schools) were among the most important sites the Ottoman built. Xhamia e √áarshis√´/The √áarshia - Market Mosque in Prishtina/Kosovo The first construction of an Ottoman mosque in Kosovo dates back to 1393, Xhamia e √áarshis√´ (√áarshia or Market Mosque), and it is believed to having been built by Ottoman Sultan Bajazit to commemorate his late father Sultan Murat I, and the 1389 victory. It lies in, what was known as, the Pristina market and today it symbolizes the old part of the city. Its main characteristic is the minaret made of stone, which is the only one survived since 600 years. Xhamia e √áarshis√´ is known also as the ‚ÄúStone Mosque‚Äù, from Turkish word Ta≈ü which means stone. Other well known Ottoman mosques, just to name few, are: Gazi Ali Beg Mosque built (1410) in Vuƒçitrn, The Mosque in Krajkovo (1480) in Glogovac, The Hadum Aga‚Äôs Mosque (1595) in Gjakova, The Mosque in Polac (1635) in Skenderaj and many others. =Monuments during the Yugoslavian era= Having into account that the political mainstream of former Yugoslavia was Marxist-Leninist ideology, religion was seen as merely a social phenomenon that should be separated from state matters. The greatest blow inflicted by the government on religion were the agrarian reforms. Under these reforms, the government, according to existing laws, seized the lands and properties belonging to the religious communities. These reforms hit the Islamic community worst, as all the waqf (endowment) land and property were taken over by the state. The state confiscated also all types of property such as rest-houses, khans (hostels), shops, and mills, which were the main sources of income for the religious institutions. Mosques and Churches, mainly Catholic and sometimes Orthodox, were used as ammunition depots or military hostels. Many mosques were destroyed under the pretext of development, urbanisation, or the building of highways. Today's national theater stands in the place where one mosque was some 60 years ago. The religious communities opposed such reforms, and criticized the government for the confiscation of their property, but the government never listened, maintaining that these acquisitions were necessary in the light of an economic crisis. In fact, after some time the Yugoslav government gave back churches and monasteries acquired from the Orthodox people, because they did not need them anymore, it never returned the mosques, which were demolished. So, in the name of protecting historical, religious and cultural monuments, Yugoslavia protected and invested in the Orthodox monuments only, meanwhile did nothing to protect the Islamic or Catholic monuments. Although Muslims were the largest community, out of 137 historical monuments under the state ‚Äòprotection‚Äô, only 26 were Islamic, 2 Catholic, while 110 were Orthodox Christian. From the above stated it is obvious that there have always been tendencies to make the Muslims in former Yugoslavia seem as anachronistic and to make them join instead the faith of the larger nations of Serbia or Croatia. In the war of 1998‚Äì1999, almost half of Kosovo's 218 mosques were burned down or otherwise destroyed. Most of these Mosques dated from the 15th and 16th centuries, and many works of Islamic architecture were razed to the grounds as a result of the systematic policy of culture and urban genocide by the Yugoslav state in Kosovo‚Äôs culture. =Monuments today= The Islamic community of Kosovo has managed to repair some of the badly damaged mosques, and even to build some new ones in the aftermath, using mainly community funds, voluntary donations by individuals, NGOs and governmental organizations such as the UAE contingent in the KFOR operation. Xhamia e Kastriotit/the Mosque of Kastriot city/Kosovo The Mosque of Kastriot city is, as seen in the picture, among the new mosques built after the war. The contributions usually come from businessmen and wealthy people. Sometimes Kosovan Muslims, living in the west, do fundraising among their compatriots and bring the money back to their home country. This is especially related to helping the poor receive donations and rebuild the mosques. The Islamic Community of Kosovo usually organizes and manages these fundraising projects, and recently ICK has announced a project about rebuilding the Great Mosque in Pristina after getting the permission by relevant authorities. Some six Islamic monuments in Kosovo, among them Red Mosque in Peƒá, Hadum Mosque in Gjakova, De√ßan Mosque, and Hammam of Ali Bey in Vuƒçitrn, were selected to be restored by the UNESCO as well. UNESCO also sent two missions, in March 2003 and April 2004, to assess damage to Kosovo‚Äôs cultural heritage in Kosovo. The findings of these missions resulted with a list of 48 Christian sites, 14 Islamic sites and 13 secular and historic buildings to present to the donors. Mosques Mosques are the houses of worship for Muslims. There are roughly about 500 mosques in Kosovo and they are spread all over the country. Most of them can be found in Prizren due to large Ottoman influence in the city and the presence of a small Turkish community there. =(Ahmed) Al‚ÄìAga Mosque (1268)= Al‚ÄìAga Mosque, the oldest Mosque in Kosovo was built in 1268 according to a wall inscription just outside the mosque. However, the mosque is today a ruin. According to Islamic community council in Draga≈° in 1995 they received formal document by the Mufti office of Aleppo city, in Arab Republic of Syria, where it is clearly stated that a family named Al-Aga have been migrated from Aleppo to former Yugoslav territories, particularly in the area known as Mlika. This family, according to this document, began migrating in 1095 and continued until 1291. This mosque lies in the southern part of Kosovo and has been reconstructed several times during its history, thanks to volunteer donations of the community and people of the good will. It is still active and quite a good congregation frequents the mosque especially during Friday (Juma) prayers. =Gazi Ali Beg Mosque (1410)= Gazi Ali Beg Mosque was under state protection being considered as one of the oldest mosques of the Ottoman era in municipality of Vuƒçitrn, Kosovo. The Islamic community in this city has ten mosques, the Gazi Ali Beg the oldest, eight of these mosques were burned down or destroyed. The main three mosques in the city were destroyed as well. Despite being under state protection Gazi Ali Beg Mosque was badly damaged, its minaret was mined and blown up while the roof and the windows were damaged as well due to frequent shelling during the war of 1998‚Äì99. After the war the Mosque was reconstructed. =The Mosque in Krajkovo (1480)= The Mosque of Krajkovo lies in the central part of the country, respectively municipality of Glogovac. This region is among the most affected during the war, three of the seven mosques in this area were burned down, including the Mosque of Krajkovo, two were shelled and demolished and one was completely destroyed. Being built in 1480 the Mosque of Krajkovo is regarded as the oldest in the Drenica region. People, elderly in particular, speak with special nostalgia while explaining the great history of this Mosque and the contribution of the imams offered to this area in different periods of history. After the war this Mosque was newly rebuilt by a donation of foreign (Kuwaiti) NGO operating in Kosovo for a short time. =The Hadum Aga's Mosque (1595)= Xhamia e Kusar√´ve - Gjakov√´/Mosque of Pirates in Gjakova/Kosovo Gjakova municipality is among the largest Islamic community councils. Among 40 religious objects the Hadum Aga's Mosque is regarded as the oldest in the city. Gjakova during the Ottoman time was considered as a village which has a local market for the needs of the community at that time. This was the fate not only for Gjakova but for many other Kosovo cities until the late 15th and early 16th centuries. By the end of the 16th century, in 1594‚Äì95, Hadum Suleiman Efendi - Hadum Aga, built this mosque which was named after him. According to the popular narrations this mosques was built in the land of Jak Vula, and thus the city was later renamed Yakova. This mosque was demolished as well, however, as it was under state protection the international community has taken it into consideration and it was restored via international funds. =The Mosque in Polac (1635)= It is little known about who built the Mosque in Polac, which is one of the oldest in the Skenderaj municipality and among the oldest in Drenica region. Xhamia e Polacit/The Mosque of Polac/Kosovo However, since the region was vastly involved in the last war out of 9 mosques in Skenderaj 8 were demolished. The Mosque of Polac, however, survived although it was shelled and badly damaged. Its minaret was destroyed and the Imam, Jetullah Xani, was ill-treated while being imprisoned by the Yugoslav forces. Today the Mosque has been restored by volunteer work of the villagers and it is functional.Bashkesia Islame e Kosoves, The Monograph of burned and destroyed Mosques in Kosova 1998-99, Dituria Islame, Prishtine 2000, p. 73. Tekkes (Teqe) Tekkes (or Teqe in Albanian) are houses of worship belonging to Muslim Sufi orders. There are few tekkes in Kosovo belong to different orders such as Qadariya, Ruafi'a, Halveti etc. Prizren, Gjakova and Orahovac are known to have more Sufis and Sufi tekkes. =The Great Tekke (16th Century)= The oldest and well known Tekke in Kosovo is the 16th century Great Tekke in Gjakova. The Great Tekke or \\"Teqja e Madhe\\" played a huge role in all the matters that concerned Kosovo and people living there during different eras. One of the members of this great family is Musa Shehzade, a well known patriot who was a delegate from Prizeren in the declaration of independence of Albania. Also, his activities include serving as commander of forces which took the city of Skopje, Chairman of the second league of Prizren and he was the first Albanian mayor of Prizren. Cemeteries Most of the cemeteries in Kosovo are located alongside the mosques, especially in rural areas. In urban areas such as Pristina cemeteries are outside the city. Muslim cemeteries are separated from other religious communities, and there is a continual need for more cemetery space for the Muslim community. Cemeteries are under control of the municipalities and in municipal property or property given to Islamic community for such purpose.Interview of the Mufti Naim Ternava on RTK, on 25.03.2012, available at www.bislame.net See also *Islam in Kosovo *List of mosques in Kosovo ReferencesExternal links * http://www.bislame.net * http://www.islamgjakova.net * http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1319 Islam- related lists Islam in Kosovo Monuments and memorials in Kosovo ","title":"Islamic monuments in Kosovo"},{"id":"38627085","text":"Chorister (1828-1833) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse best known for winning the classic St Leger Stakes in 1831. In a racing career which lasted from May 1830 until October 1831 he ran seven times and won four races. In the St Leger he was not regarded as a serious contender but was given an extremely well judged ride by John Barham Day to win by a short head from The Saddler. Chorister remained in training for two further seasons but never raced again and died in the autumn of 1833. Background Chorister was a bay horse standing 15.3 hands high bred by Mr. John Smith. As a yearling he was bought for 300 guineas by William Vane, Marquess of Cleveland, although the General Stud Book suggests that Cleveland bred the colt himself. Chorister's sire Lottery was a talented but temperamental horse, whose most important success came in the 1825 Doncaster Cup. At stud his other progeny included the Grand National winner Lottery and the influential stallion Sheet Anchor. Chorister was one of Lottery's first crop of foals and he was said to bear a strong resemblance to his sire. Chorister's dam, an unnamed mare by Chorus, was a granddaughter of Anticipation, whose other descendants included the outstanding racehorse and broodmare Alice Hawthorn. Racing career=1830: two-year-old season= Chorister began his racing career at York Racecourse on 18 May when he was one of eleven runners in a sweepstakes for two-year-old colts and fillies. Ridden by Thomas Lye, he started the 6/4 favourite and attracted additional attention as the first of Lottery's offspring to appear on the racecourse. The start was delayed by several false starts leading Chorister to become agitated and to kick out at the other horses. Chorister took the lead in the closing stages and held off a strong challenge from Mr Walker's filly Victoire (ridden by Bill Scott) to win by a head. More than four months after his successful debut, Chorister ran in the Champagne Stakes on the opening day of the St Leger meeting at Doncaster. He started second favourite but appeared to be \\"dead amiss\\" and finished outside the first four in the race won by Thomas Houldsworth's filly Frederica. =1831: three-year- old season= Chorister by John Frederick Herring, Sr. Chorister made his three-year-old debut on 10 May at York in \\"The Shorts\\", a one-mile sweepstakes for which his only opponent was The Saddler, who had won the York St Leger on the previous afternoon. The Saddler led from the start and won by a length, leading the Sporting Magazine to comment that \\"Chorister appears to have lost all his voice\\". After a break of three months, Chorister returned to York in August where he contested weight-for-age subscription race over two miles. Ridden by Lye, he started the 6/4 favourite and won from the five-year-old mare Fortitude. On 20 September, Chorister was one of twenty-four colts and fillies to contest the Great St Leger Stakes at Doncaster. The Saddler started 3/1 favourite ahead of Lord Cleveland's more fancied runner Marcus on 7/2, while Chorister, ridden by the southern jockey John Barham Day and started a 20/1 outsider. In a strongly run race, Day restrained Chorister just behind the leaders before producing the colt with a strong run on the outside in the straight. Well inside the final furlong, Chorister made a \\"tremendous rush\\" to catch and overtake The Saddler and win by a short head. The New Sporting Magazine expressed the view that The Saddler was by far the best horse in the race, and that Chorister's victory had been almost entirely due to Day's superior jockeyship. Two days later, over the same course and distance, Chorister was matched against Liverpool, a horse who had finished unplaced in the St Leger, in the Gascoigne Stakes. The race was run at a slow pace before the horses accelerated entering the straight and after a strongly contested finish the two colts crossed the line together with the judge declaring dead heat. Lord Cleveland made an offer to divide the stakes, but Liverpool's owner insisted on a run-off later that afternoon. The deciding heat was again run at a very slow pace before the straight, but on this occasion Liverpool showed the superior acceleration to win by two lengths. Commenting on the fact that Chorister seemed better suited to racing in a large field of runners the Sporting Magazine's correspondent wrote that \\"it was more agreeable to him to sing with a full orchestra than take a part in a duet\\". On 14 October, Chorister appeared for the final time at Northallerton, where he contested the local Gold Cup. He won the two-mile event from Lady Elizabeth. Chorister never ran after his win at Northallerton. The New Sporting Magazine offered the opinion that he would be a \\"formidable goer\\" as a four-year-old, but he did not contest any races in 1832. According to the General Stud Book, Chorister died as a five-year-old in 1833. The New Sporting Magazine reporting on the 1833 St Leger meeting in September 1833 reported that Chorister had died \\"a day or two\\" previously. Pedigree * Chorister was inbred 4 x 4 to Woodpecker and Beningbrough, meaning that both of these stallions appear twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

The cabinet was a single-party minority government consisting the Liberal People's Party. The cabinet was led by Prime Minister Ola Ullsten who was asked to form a minority government by the Speaker of the Riksdag after several failed attempts to form an active/inactive majority cabinet. The cabinet was the first cabinet consisting only of the Liberal People's Party since 1932 and is also the only since then (as of September 2018). The cabinet resigned on 12 October 1979 following the 1979 general election to make way for a coalition majority government led by Thorbj√∂rn F√§lldin. The cabinet was succeeded by Thorbj√∂rn F√§lldin's Second Cabinet.  Policy  The Swedish nuclear energy program had been enacted by the Riksdag in 1975 which entailed an expansion to 13 nuclear power plants in total by 1985. The Riksdag had also decided that energy policy was to be re- evaluated in 3 years and that the safety of nuclear power was to be investigated. The previous F√§lldin Cabinet had instated a committee with the task of evaluating nuclear safety. Minister for Energy Carl Tham was working on drafting a government bill regarding energy policy, with Social Democrats Ingvar Carlsson and Birgitta Dahl following his work closely. Both the Social Democratic and Moderate parties held positive views regarding nuclear power and it was assumed that the government wouldn't have any difficulties passing the bill. However, following the Three Mile Island accident, everything changed. While Olof Palme, the Social Democratic leader, had criticized the F√§lldin cabinet for unnecessarily delaying the expansion of nuclear power in the past, Palme and his party did a complete turn-around on the issue, demanding a popular referendum to decide the future of nuclear power on 4 April 1979. During the remainder of the spring, the parties discussed how a popular referendum was to be performed and what choices voters would have. Eventually, it was decided that voters would be able to pick three choices, all of which revolved around abolishing nuclear power at various rates. Ingemar Mundebo, the Minister for the Economy and the Budget, was working on a proposal to lower the marginalskatt tax (sv) and enacting an upper limit to the tax. The government expected the proposition to pass with the support of the Centre Party and Moderates. In the spring of 1979, however, the Centre Party voted against the proposal, since they found inconsistencies in financing the proposal. The bill, thus, did not pass. In December 1978 it was revealed that while Sweden was supporting the East Timor independence movement, the government was simultaneously allowing the export of arms to the occupying Indonesian forces. The Minister for Trade Hadar Cars stated that this was completely allowed. The government also managed to pass several reforms, such as increased parental insurance, corporate tax reforms and a new education plan (Lgr80). Child corporal punishment was legally abolished during the reign of the Ullsten cabinet.

Since its inception, there have been two main generations of the company. They are known as the \\"First Generation\\" and the \\"Second Generation\\", which is also known as the new generation. The First Generation refers to the founding members of Kosovo Ballet who performed with the company until its forced disbanding. The Second Generation refers to the group of dancers who trained under Ahmet Brahimaj to reform Kosovo Ballet following the Yugoslav Wars. First Generation Ballet dancers from the First Generation were educated at the Secondary School of Ballet in Skopje, under the direction of Tatjana Petkovska. Following their graduation, 25 dancers from this class returned to Pristina where they formed the official first generation of The Kosovo Ballet within the National Theatre of Kosovo. The company would go on to perform throughout former Yugoslavia, at the Ballet Biennale in Ljubljana, and the Summer Games in Dubrovnik. Unfortunately the company was forcibly disbanded in 1991 due to ongoing violence and the threat of ethnic cleansing from the Yugoslav Wars. Members of the first generation included: Ahmet Brahimaj, Rustem Selca, Asma Mulla, Selajdin Kice, Gani Loshi, and Jonuz Beqiraj. They performed under the direction of Abdurrahman Nokshiqi. Due to the lack of female ballet dancers, five female ballet dancers from Skopje joined the company (including Nexhmije Meha Selma and Sabrije Spahiu Shkreli), as well as two ballet dancers from Kosovo (Enver Elshani and Jashar Berisha). During this period, Kosovo Ballet worked many guest artists from around the world. These dancers included, England: Vanda Ibra, Suzan Lejk and Xhoana Xhenkins; Poland: Joana Andziak, Lidija Tomashevska and Ana Stavnjak; Romania: Lilana Benudau; Belgrade: Vjollca Curri; and The Philippines: Marja Bertlan. Second Generation In 2001, with the conclusion of the Yugoslav Wars, Ahmet Brahimaj made the decision to rebuild the company. Pursuing this endeavor, he established the first High School of Ballet in collaboration with Prenk Jakova; the Secondary Musical School, and began to recruit young people. Five years later, the first class of this school graduated under his directorship. Today, these dancers comprise the core ensemble of Kosovo Ballet as the company's Second Generation. Notable dancers Current members of Kosovo Ballet include: Repertoire Following its re-establishment, the company worked closely with the Albanian choreographer Gjergj Prevazi to stage four of his modern dance works: Tranzicioni II (Transition II), S'po d√´gjohet gong (Can't hear the gong), Kontrast (Contrast) and Performance. The company worked extensively with Elton Cefa to build up its repertoire of classical ballets. Under his guidance, the company performed excerpts from Don Quixote, Giselle, Le Corsaire, and Swan Lake. A fortuitous relationship with the Bulgarian prima-ballerina Sylvia Tomov started the production of full-length classical ballets for the company, in this instance The Sleeping Beauty. Additional acclaimed works within the company's repertoire include: Sergey Sergeev's staging of Carmen Konstantin Uralsky's More Than Two to Tango Arian Ib√´rshimi's The Paganini Rhapsody and Ping Pong Spectrum Arthur Kuggeleyn's Oh my God; a remake of Dios Mio made specifically for Kosovo Ballet Mehmet Balkan's and Larissa Barth's Relationships Iliad Kerni's Love that Kills and Graduation Ball Alexander Tressor's Dancing with the Moon Michael Mao's VERDI REQUIEM Iliad Kerni's Kopelia Israel Rodriguez's My Freedom Antonio Fini's Where the Light Falls Festivals Besides working with numerous acclaimed choreographers, Kosovo Ballet has partnered with various dance companies from around the world. Among them, the company collaborated with the American experimental theater La Mama to perform the musical Diana.

She was one of the first women plant pathologists. She is sometimes referred to as \\"Anne- Marie Libert.\\"  Early life  Marie-Anne Libert was born in Malmedy in April 1782, twelfth of the thirteen children of Henri-Joseph Libert and his wife Marie-Jeanne-Bernadine Libert (n√©e Dubois). The parents, educated members of the middle class who ran a tanning business, recognised her intellectual potential. She was initially a pupil of the S√©pulcrines of Malmedy. At the age of eleven her parents sent her to stay in Pr√ºm in Germany to learn German and the violin, both of which she quickly mastered. Her father recognised his daughter's emerging interest in the exact sciences and taught her algebra and geometry, so that she could follow him into the business. She was enthusiastic and pushed the education well beyond the needs of commerce. At an age when other girls only wanted to amuse themselves, Marie-Anne Libert was motivated by a thirst for knowledge: everything interested her, she wanted to know everything. Nature drew her in particular; she spent long hours walking in the area of Malmedy, particularly in the High Fens. She observed, gathered many minerals and plants then identified them in her father's office, cataloguing and classifying them. As most reference works were written in Latin, she began to teach herself Latin.  Botany and mycology  Her work in botany, or more precisely in cryptogams, of an undeniable scientific rigour, earned her an international reputation. She corresponded with scientists in Belgium and elsewhere. She also collaborated for a time with Dr. Lejeune of Verviers, who was preparing a catalogue of the plants of the Department of Ourthe. Dr. Lejeune introduced Libert to the Swiss botanist Augustin Pyramis de Candolle, who encouraged her to work on cryptogamic flora. Libert's later produced a cryptogamic flora of the Ardennes. She was one of the first to identify the organism responsible for the \\"late blight\\" disease of the potato, which she named Botrytis vastatrix Lib. and of which she gave a detailed description in a report written in August 1845.. The German mycologist Anton de Bary built on this discovery, among other work, when he showed in 1876 that the oomycete, Phytophthora infestans as he renamed it, was the cause of late blight, and not the consequence as was still believed at the time.. She also described several plant pathogenic Ascomycetes, including Alternaria cheiranthi (Lib.) PC Bolle (basionym: Helminthosporium cheiranthi Lib.) a pathogen of wallflower, and Fusarium coeruleum Lib. ex Sacc., the causative agent of dry rot of potato. In total, she described over 200 new taxa.  Other interests  The study of ancient languages had directed her attention towards archaeology. In the last years of her life, when her age no longer allowed her to run around the countryside, she devoted considerable time to the history of the Principality of Stavelot-Malmedy. She gave to history and archeology the same scientific rigour as to her botanical studies, using all available sources. In addition to her herbarium, she formed a remarkable collection of pearls obtained from large pearl mussels found in abundance in the river Ambl√®ve and its tributaries. She also assembled a large collection of coins. This intense scientific activity was no obstacle to business. She took that with the same determination as her research, the same desire to do well. With her brothers, she was able to make a large extension to the small tannery which they had inherited from their parents. After a short illness, Marie-Anne Libert died in Malmedy on 14 January 1865.  Honours  The taxa Libertia (a genus of the family Iridaceae) and Libertiella (ascomycete fungi) were named after her. The \\"Cercle naturaliste de la r√©gion de Malmedy\\", founded in 1951, which later became \\"Cercle Royal Marie-Anne Libert\\", took its name in her honour. In 1965, the centenary of her death, there was erected a stele decorated with a medallion bearing the likeness of Marie-Anne Libert in the Tanneries park (Parc Marie-Anne Libert) in Malmedy.. A street in Malmedy (Rue Marie-Anne Libert) was named after her in 1925. In 1820 she became as associate member of the Soci√©t√© Linn√©enne de Paris (Linnean Society of Paris), and Emperor Friedrich-Wilhelm III awarded her a gold medal of merit. She was the first woman invited to join the Soci√©t√© Royale de Botanique de Belgique in 1862.  Publications  : Libert M-A (1813). Cryptogamie, In Flore des environs de Spa ‚Ä¶ vol. 2 (ALS Lejeune).

He founded the Lindt chocolate factory and invented the conching machine and other processes to improve the quality of chocolate.  Life  Lindt was born in Berne to pharmacist and politician Johann Rudolf Lindt and his wife Armalia Eugenia Salchli. From 1873 to 1875 he had a training job in Lausanne with the Am√©d√©e Kohler & fils chocolate company. In 1879 he founded his own chocolate factory in the Mattequartier on the Aare in Bern. In December 1879 he succeeded in improving the then moderate quality of chocolate by the development of the conching machine, a lengthwise stirring device which gives a finer consistency and lets undesired aromas evaporate. He was among the first chocolate makers to add cocoa butter back into the chocolate mass. These two innovations contributed greatly to the high quality of Swiss chocolate. In 1899 Lindt sold his factory and the secret of conching to the Chocolat Spr√ºngli AG, who have traded as Chocoladefabriken Lindt & Spr√ºngli AG since. Spr√ºngli paid 1.5 million Gold francs for the marketing rights and the recipe.  Sources   Alex Capus: Patriarchen: Zehn Portraits.

It had some success in the early twentieth century, although from the Second World War its influence declined. Nevertheless, temperance organisations continue to remain active today. 'Sons of Temperance' Procession, Hill End, New South Wales, 1872. Image from collection of National Archives of Australia. History In Australia, the temperance movement began in the mid-1830s, promoting moderation rather than abstinence. The Independent Order of Rechabites has been active in promoting temperance in Australia from the 1870s to the present-day; the Band of Hope was also very active in many states, and in Sydney, the Australian Home Companion and Band of Hope Journal was published between 1856 and 1861. In the 1880s, a significant number of hotels around the country were built as or converted to coffee palaces, where no alcohol would be served. With the waning of the influence of the temperance movement, most of these hotels either applied for liquor licenses or were demolished. In the mid-1880s the US-based Woman's Christian Temperance Union, a more successful abstinence-oriented movement, set up a branch in Australia. The inaugural President of the federated Australasian Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) was Jessie Ackermann, who visited the country in 1889, 1891 and 1894. However, the movement failed to bring about prohibition, as happened in the United States, despite a long campaign for a local option. Both the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the Rechabites achieved a major success during the First World War when they were successful in bringing in mandatory closure of hotel bars and public houses at 6 pm, from the previous norm of 11 or 11.30 pm. The first state to introduce early closing was South Australia in 1916 as a war austerity measure. New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania followed in the same year, as did New Zealand in 1917. Western Australia adopted a 9pm closing time, but Queensland retained the old closing times until it introduced eight o'clock closing in 1923. Alcohol was originally banned in Canberra but was made legal again following a plebiscite in 1928. Six o'clock closing was considered a failure as it did not curb alcohol consumption and led to the notorious six o'clock swill where customers would rush to drinking establishments after work and consume alcohol heavily and rapidly in anticipation of the 6 o'clock closing. Early hotel closing times began being wound back from the 1930s, with the last Australian state, South Australia, doing so in 1967. In contemporary society A legacy of the temperance movement is Melbourne's ‚Äúdry areas‚Äù where residents must vote to approve liquor licences in the area. These areas are a small pocket of about a dozen suburbs in the eastern suburbs, which are subject to such severe restrictions on the issuing of liquor licences that they are without any pubs and have a limited number of other licensed venues. In the 1920s, local opinion polls were taken and residents of these areas voted for the creation of a dry area.Crikey.com.au 16 February 2011 Today, organisations such as the Independent Order of Rechabites and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union continue to promote the cause of temperance, specifically focussing on \\"preventing the extension of hotel opening hours and the increase of licences\\" as well as promoting \\"public education and the health and social effects of alcohol\\". Newer groups, such as the Foundation for Alcohol Research & Education (founded in 2001), have arisen and have launched campaigns such as one to ban alcohol advertising at sporting events.

Early life Prince Irakli was born in Erivan, then part of the Persian Empire, in 1826. His father, Alexander, had left his homeland in 1800 and had since been trying to overthrow the Russian regime in Georgia. Irakli's mother was Mariam, daughter of Sahak Melik-Aghamalyan, the influential Armenian dignitary of Erivan. Soon after Irakli's birth, Erivan was taken by the Russian army in the course of the Russo‚ÄìPersian war of 1826‚Äì1828, which occasioned Alexander's separation with his family. Mariam and Irakli lived in Erivan until 1834, when they were moved by the Russian government to St. Petersburg, where Irakli received his military training, first at the Alexandrovsky Military College and then the Page Corps.Montgomery 1980, p. 66.

Election management Over a long period, Oldfield operated as an election agent or manager. He was secretary of the Westminster electoral committee in 1780; and again secretary of the Westminster Association in 1783/4. In 1785 he introduced Henry Flood at Seaford. Over numerous procedural difficulties, Flood was elected in 1786.historyofparliamentonline.org, Flood, Henry (1732-91), of Farmley, co. Kilkenny. At East Retford in 1812 Oldfield offered himself as election manager to George Osbaldeston. His candidate was elected, but then refused to settle financially with Oldfield. Oldfield then turned informer on the electoral corruption that had been involved. Views Oldfield took the view that participation in deliberation and legislation was an inherent ancient right. In this he had something in common with Gilbert Stuart. This attitude was contested by the British Review in 1818, taking the line that rights had been attained by struggle. Oldfield mixed the concepts of historic right and natural right freely.Jann, p. 131.

It was written by Bryan Goluboff and directed by Larry Shaw. The episode premiered on NBC on February 19, 2013, the third episode of Season 2. Eileen introduces Tom and Julia to a new writing partner in order to fix Bombshell's script; Karen confers with Derek about Jimmy and Kyle's musical that they are working on; Derek tries to get reinstated as the director for The Wiz revival with Veronica Moore. Plot Eileen Rand (Anjelica Huston) sets up Bombshell songwriters Julia Houston (Debra Messing) and Tom Levitt (Christian Borle) with a new writing partner, Peter (Daniel Sunjata), who is known as a dramaturg or a \\"script doctor\\", in order to fix the script of Bombshell. Julia is very resistant to the idea and has a difficult time warming up to him and his ideas about how to fix the musical. He suggests that there was a lot about Joe DiMaggio in the script because she was in love with the actor who played him. He also suggests there isn't enough steam in the show, giving Julia the idea to write a scene about JFK. The beginning of the episode shows Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee) singing a song called \\"Good for You\\" at a concert and body-surfing through the audience. It turns out that she's just imagining it as she has Derek Wills (Jack Davenport) listen to the song she recorded as a demo to help the two younger songwriters who wrote it, Jimmy Collins (Jeremy Jordan) and Kyle Bishop (Andy Mientus). Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) auditions for a part in the ensemble of a new musical Liaisons. She talks the producer into letting her also audition for Cecile, the lead female. She starts doubting herself while preparing for the audition and goes to talk to Derek about it, interrupting a Bombshell work session with Karen and the ensemble for \\"They Just Keep Moving the Line\\". As she ponders things, she fantasizes herself singing \\"Dancing On My Own\\" while Karen and the ensemble work out an arrangement to the Bombshell song. She tells Derek he's having trouble with the choreography because he's doubting himself. She also confers with Tom about her anxiety and he manages to make her feel better. She later tells Tom that she got the part of Cecile. Derek is trying to get back his job as director for the upcoming The Wiz revival with Veronica Moore (Jennifer Hudson). He invites Veronica and a Wiz producer to watch a new number for Bombshell that they're staging, about the first time that JFK and Marilyn met, which Julia wrote after her conversations with Peter. We see a fantasy version of an actor named Simon (Julian Ovenden) and Karen as JFK and Marilyn meeting for the first time at a party. He sings \\"Our Little Secret\\" to her as a seduction while she acts demur and then they sleep together. Later, Julia feels really good about the scene, but Peter tells her that the problem with it is that she wrote it as JFK is the seducer and the Marilyn is being seduced, and that it should be the other way around. Jimmy and Kyle are trying to put their Hit List musical into a coherent order so that they can show it to Derek. A notebook with some important information is missing from their pile, so Jimmy goes back to where he left it, an apparently not-nice place where he used to live. He runs into the homeowner, a man who appears to have a rocky relationship with Jimmy. When we see Jimmy later, he appears to have been in a fight, but he did retrieve the notebook. They meet with Derek and Karen and pitch their story of Hit List. Kyle says Act Two needs some work, but Derek says it sounds good overall and he's willing to help them. Derek runs into Veronica, who tells him she dropped out of The Wiz revival. She wants to do a one night only concert to show that she's more than a goody two shoes and wants to make an impact on the world. She asks him to help her with it and he agrees. Production Jennifer Hudson guest stars as Veronica Moore, in her second of a three episode arc. Five songs are featured in this episode, three originals (one a reprise) and two covers (Robyn's \\"Dancing On My Own\\" and \\"Soon As I Get Home\\" from The Wiz musical, which is sung by Veronica rehearsing for The Wiz musical). For the three originals, the show's in-house songwriters Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman wrote \\"Our Little Secret\\" and the reprised \\"They Just Keep Moving the Line\\", while Drew Gasparini wrote \\"Good For You\\".BroadwayWorld.com, February 18, 2013, \\"New Smash Song: 'Good For You'\\" \\"Dancing On My Own\\" and \\"Good For You\\" were released as singles for sale from iTunes and Amazon.com's MP3 store, while \\"Our Little Secret\\" and \\"They Just Keep Moving the Line\\" are available on the cast album Bombshell.

The text reads \\"This is to certify that [Lottie Maria Brewer] is a member of the above society having signed the following pledge.\\" The temperance movement in New Zealand originated as a social movement in the late-19th century. In general, the temperance movement aims at curbing the consumption of alcohol. Although it met with local success, it narrowly failed to impose national prohibition on a number of occasions in the early-20th century. Temperance organisations remain active in New Zealand today. Early movement In 1836, the first recorded temperance meeting was held in the Bay of Islands (Northland). Beginning in the 1860s, many Non-conformist churches encouraged abstinence among their congregations, and numerous temperance societies were established throughout the country. Many provinces passed licensing ordinances giving residents the right to secure, by petition, the cancellation or granting of liquor licences in their district. The Licensing Act of 1873 allowed the prohibition of liquor sales in districts if petitioned by two-thirds of residents. Despite the efforts of the temperance movement, the rate of convictions for drunkenness remained constant in New Zealand. In 1886, a national body called the New Zealand Alliance for Suppression and Abolition of the Liquor Traffic was formed, pushing for control of the liquor trade as a democratic right. Early in 1886, arrangements were made for T. W. Glover, a lecturer from the United Kingdom Alliance, to conduct prohibition missions in various New Zealand centres. On 1 March 1886, at the Rechabite Hall, Wellington, 30 delegates ‚Äì representing Auckland, Nelson, Hawke's Bay, Woodville, Canterbury, New Plymouth, Dunedin, Wellington, Alexandra (Otago), Invercargill, Greymouth, Masterton, the Blue Ribbon Union, the Good Templars Lodge, the Rechabite Lodge, and the Wellington Alliance met, to establish a union of the temperance alliances in New Zealand. This conference formed and drafted a constitution for the New Zealand Alliance for the Suppression of the Liquor Traffic and the following officers were elected: president, Sir William Fox; sixteen vice- presidents, including David Goldie, Hori Ropiha, Sir Harry Atkinson, Leonard Isitt, and Sir Robert Stout; executive committee, F. G. Ewington, Edward Withy, George Winstone, H. J. Le Bailey, J. Elkin, Dr C. Knight, John Waymouth, and R. Neal. Henry Field (Nelson) became the first general secretary and T. W. Glover the first paid organiser. The conference adopted the United Kingdom Alliance's (1853) declaration of principles. Towards the end of the 19th century, it became apparent that problems associated with settlement, such as larrikinism and drunkenness, were growing in society. Increasing urbanisation heightened public awareness of the gap between social aspirations and reality of the young colony. Generalisations from newspapers, visiting speakers & politicians in the 1890s allowed development of large public overreaction and fervour to the magnitude of the problem of alcohol. Political action 19th-century banner of the Women's Christian Temperance Union in Gore In 1893, the Alcoholic Liquors Sale Control Act aligned licensing districts with parliamentary electorates. Licensing polls were to be held with each general election. There were now three options to choose from. These were \\"continuance of the \\"status quo\\", reduction of the number of liquor licences by 25 percent, and \\"local no-licence\\" which would prevent public sale of alcohol within that electorate. Continuance and reduction only needed a majority, but local no licence needed three-fifths majority. From 1908, national prohibition became the third choice instead of reduction of licences ‚Äì needing a three-fifths majority.Newman, Richard (April, 1975). 'New Zealand's Vote for Prohibition in 1911' in the New Zealand Journal of History, vol. 9, no. 1, p. 53. In 1894, Clutha electorate voted ‚Äòno-licence‚Äô and in 1902 Mataura and Ashburton followed suit. In 1905 Invercargill, Oamaru and Grey Lynn voted ‚Äòno-licence‚Äô. In 1908 Bruce, Wellington Suburbs, Wellington South, Masterton, and Eden voted ‚Äòno-licence' and many wine makers were denied the right to sell their wines locally and were forced out of business. In 1911, the Liquor Amendment Act provided for a national poll on prohibition and the New Zealand Viticultural Association was formed to ‚Äúsave this fast decaying industry by initiation of such legislation as will restore confidence among those who after long years of waiting have almost lost confidence in the justice of the Government. Through harsh laws and withdrawal of government support and encouragement that had been promised, a great industry had been practically ruined.‚Äù Also in 1911, a national referendum on prohibition was held, with 55.8 percent in favour of prohibition, but not enough for the sixty percent majority required.Christoffel, Paul (October 2008). 'Prohibition and the Myth of 1919' in The Zealand Journal of History, vol 42, no. 2, pp. 156‚Äì157. In 1914, sensing a growing feeling of wowserism, Prime Minister Massey lambasted Dalmatian wine as \\"a degrading, demoralizing and sometimes maddening drink.\\" Another referendum was held this year with 49 percent voting in favour of prohibition. The three-fifths majority was replaced with a fifty percent majority. The 1917 election was delayed until 1919 because of the First World War.Christoffel, pp. 156‚Äì157. In 1917, New Zealand introduced mandatory early closing of bars and pubs. This created a phenomenon known as the \\"six o'clock swill\\"‚Äîa culture of heavy drinking developed during the time between finishing work at 5 pm and the mandatory closing time only an hour later. On 10 April 1919, a national poll for continuance was carried with 51%, due only to votes of the Expeditionary Force soldiers returning from Europe. On 7 December 1919, prohibition gained 49.7 percent of the vote; of the 543,762 votes originally cast, the prohibition lobby only lost out by 1632 votes and of the 1744 special votes, 278 were for prohibition.Christoffel, p. 158. Restrictive legislation was introduced on sale of liquor, however by 1928 the percentage of prohibition votes had started to decline. Early-closing laws were eventually repealed in 1967 after a referendum was held on the subject of closing times for New Zealand pubs (though an earlier referendum in 1949 had retained it). Present movement Temperance organisations, such as the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and New Zealand Alliance for Total Suppression of the Liquor Trade, continue to remain active in New Zealand today. Newer groups, such as Alcohol Advisory Council of New Zealand, focus their efforts on \\"the connections between health and alcohol; road accidents and alcohol; and patterns of youth drinking with associated sexual health issues.\\" See also *Alcohol in New Zealand *New Zealand alcohol licensing referendums 1894‚Äì1987 *International Organisation of Good Templars References Further reading  * External links *Woman's Christian Temperance Union ‚Äì New Zealand *Alcohol health warning labels 'highly deficient' ‚Äì study History of New Zealand Alcohol in New Zealand New Zealand Social movements in New Zealand ","title":"Temperance movement in New Zealand"},{"id":"38627329","text":"Adventure Jackson Gregory (March 12, 1882 ‚Äì June 12, 1943) was an American teacher, journalist, and writer.

Before this, though there were diatribes published against drunkenness and excess, total abstinence from alcohol was very rarely advocated or practised. The earliest temperance societies, inspired by the Belfast professor of theology, and Presbyterian Church of Ireland minister John Edgar, who poured his stock of whiskey out of his window in 1829, concentrated their efforts on spirits rather than wine and beer.Peter Fryer (1965) Mrs Grundy: Studies in English Prudery: 141-44. Corgi Joseph Livesey was another British temperance advocate who financed his philanthropic work with the profits attained from cheese production, following an introduction to the food product by a doctor he had consulted with regards to a serious ailment in 1816. The term teetotal is derived from a speech by Richard (Dickie) Turner, a follower of Livesey, in Preston in 1833. Livesey opened the first temperance hotel in 1833 and the next year founded the first temperance magazine, The Preston Temperance Advocate (1834‚Äì37).Peter Fryer (1965) Mrs Grundy: Studies in English Prudery: 146. Corgi The British Association for the Promotion of Temperance was established by 1835. Timeline The first British organisation that promoted temperance was founded by John Dunlop and his aunt Lillias Graham of Gairbraid and named the Glasgow and West of Scotland Temperance Society, which was formed in 1829. In 1838, the mass working class movement for universal suffrage, Chartism, included a current called \\"temperance chartism\\". Faced with the refusal of the parliament of the time to give the right to vote to working people, the temperance chartists saw the campaign against alcohol as a way of proving to the elites that working- class people were responsible enough to be granted the vote. In 1847, the Band of Hope was founded in Leeds, with the stated aim of saving working class children from the perils of drink. The members had to pledge to abstain \\"from all liquors of an intoxicating quality, whether ale, porter, wine or ardent spirits, except as medicine\\"Nick Brownlee (2002) This is Alcohol: 99 In 1853, inspired by the Maine law in the US, the United Kingdom Alliance was formed aimed at promoting a similar law prohibiting the sale of alcohol in the UK. This hard-line group of prohibitionists was opposed by other temperance organisations who preferred moral persuasion to a legal ban. This division in the ranks limited the effectiveness of the temperance movement as a whole. The impotence of legislation in this field was demonstrated when the Sale of Beer Act 1854 which restricted Sunday opening hours had to be repealed, following widespread rioting. In 1859 a prototype prohibition bill was overwhelmingly defeated in the House of Commons.Nick Brownlee (2002) This is Alcohol: 99‚Äì100 One of the most active advocates of temperance was Dr. Norman Shanks Kerr. He promoted the treatment of inebriates and held that inebriety was a disease, not a vice, and that it should be treated accordingly. In 1884, in response to the inadequacy of the Habitual Drunkards Act of 1879, he founded the Society for the Study and Cure of Inebriety and was the first president. The society still exists as the Society for the Study of Addiction. The temperance movement received an unexpected boost due to state intervention when the Liberal government passed the Defence of the Realm Act in 1914 at the beginning of the First World War. According to the provisions of this act pub hours were licensed, beer was watered down and was subject to a penny a pint extra tax.Nick Brownlee (2002) This is Alcohol: 106 This situation was maintained by the subsequent establishment of the State Management Scheme in 1916 which nationalised breweries and pubs in certain areas of Britain where armaments manufacture was taking place. At the same time, there were secular temperance organisations connected to the labour movement. An example would be the Scottish Prohibition Party, founded by a communist temperance activist called Bob Stewart, who followed the British Labour Party on all other issues. There was a Marxist offshoot called the Prohibition and Reform Party, which later became part of the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1920. Between the wars, American exponents of the sterling example set to Britain by National Prohibition, such as William \\"Pussyfoot\\" Johnson and Dr Armor, toured the country, to be met with derision, and in Johnson's case, violence.Peter Fryer (1965) Mrs Grundy: Studies in English Prudery: 171-3. Corgi In the end, the dismal example of the complete failure of Prohibition in America put paid to any remote chance that the temperance lobby would succeed in achieving its aims in the UK.Nick Brownlee (2002) This is Alcohol: 107 The former Manchester City F.C. football stadium Maine Road took its name from a street that had been renamed Maine Road (from Dog Kennel Lane) by members of the Temperance Movement. They selected the name as a result of the 1853 Maine law. Religious support Early on, various Nonconformist groups, notably the Methodists, Quakers and The Salvation Army (founded in 1864), lobbied parliament to restrict alcohol sales. In Wales Lady Llanover, motivated by Calvinistic Methodists teachings, closed all the public houses on her estate and was an outspoken critic of the evils of alcohol. The Church of England Temperance Society, which had roots in the Anglo-Catholic tradition was founded in 1862, and its volunteers within the court system would lead to the first probation service. The League of the Cross was a Catholic total abstinence organisation founded in 1873 by Cardinal Manning. In 1876 the British Women's Temperance Association was formed to persuade men to stop drinking, rebranded in 2006 as the White Ribbon Association. From 1880 to 1882 the cause of abstinence was revived by the Gospel Temperance or Blue Ribbon movement, based in America. They sent a member named Richard Booth to promote their cause in England through mass meetings held up and down the country.Peter Fryer (1965) Mrs Grundy: Studies in English Prudery: 153-4.

His name has also been recorded as Ercole da Ferrara, da Sesso, dei Fidelis, de Fedeli or de Fedelis.

Van Gogh produced other earlier paintings of Torso of Venus during his stay in Paris, such as the Torso of Venus in 1886, which was exhibited at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam.

Like the Shore Temple, the Olakkannesvara Temple is a structural temple. Built in the 8th century, it is situated directly above the Mahishasuramardini mandapa on a hillock which provides scenic views of the town. As the area is within a high security zone because of a nuclear power station a few kilometres to its south, photography is prohibited. The Olakkannesvara Temple is sometimes mistakenly referred to as a Mahishasura temple. It is dedicated to an incarnation of Shiva. It is one of the Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram that were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1984. Etymology Mahishasuramardhhini Cave temple, Mahabalipuram. Commonly, the building has been known as the \\"Olakkanatha Temple\\". Its original name, however, was Olakkannesvara, a corruption of \\"Ulaikkannisvaram\\" (meaning: the temple of Siva whose forehead contains the crescent moon or eye of wisdom). Olakkannesvara is mistakenly called a Mahishasura temple as it is situated above the Mahishasuramardini mandapa (cave temple). Geography Olakkannesvara Temple is located in Mahabalipuram town. Facing east, the temple is accessed only be a series of cut steps on exposed rock. It is situated on the top of a hill, above the Mahishasuramardini mandapa near the modern lighthouse. It is approximately from Chennai city (previously, Madras) and about from Chengalpet. The area is a high security zone as there is a nuclear power station about a few kilometers to its south. History Like the Shore Temple, the Olakkannesvara Temple was built during the reign of the Pallava dynasty king Rajasimha. Archaeologist Albert Longhurst observed that prior to the construction of the present lighthouse at this site in 1900, the roof of the Olakkannesvara Temple served as the lighthouse with perhaps a wooden shed structure on the roof. Worship was offered in this temple till the nineteenth century. Features Olakkannesvara Temple The structure is built of grey-white granite. The shikhara or tower of the temple is interpreted to have been built originally to the same style as the Shore Temple tower in Dravidian Architectural style but is now non-existent. A small ardha-mandapa (half hall) leads into a rectangular shrine. An unusual feature is that of the carving of dvarpalas (guards) of the main shrine, which are in half-profile though the space available could have used to make a full-face profile as per traditional practice of the front facing style. This is typical of Mahabalipuram Pallava style and a similar profile of dvarpalas is noted in the Trimurti Cave Temple. This is interpreted as a transition from the Mahendra style of architecture to the Rajasimha style; the transformation was from a full front facing to three-fourths and then to half profile facing each other. However, the guardians carved on the back wall of the temple are in full frontal profile. The building was formerly lined with brick masonry. On the exterior walls, there are two sculpted images in the niches of the ardha- mandapa. Enclosed within pilasters, these images of Shiva as Kalantaka killing \\"Kaala\\" (Yama) are later additions, not attributable to the Pallavas. On external walls of the main shrine, there are other niches or devkoshtas; on the south wall the sculpture is of Shiva as Dakshinamurti under a tree in seated posture, on the west face an image of Shiva and Parvati seated on Kailash Mountain with Ravana trying to shake the mountain, and an image on the north wall is of Shiva in the posture of Nataraja. The sculptures are much ruined, and were plastered and painted over hence the originality is much less visible. There are a large number of lion pilasters on the walls. There are no images of any deity inside the temple.

The Bistrica springs out of large karstic source called Vrelo Duman, which is situated within the cave in Duman neighborhood, in the heart of Old Town of Livno, also called as Bistriƒçki Grad (English: Bistriƒçki Town; Bistriƒçki is possessive form made from the river name - Bistrica). Flow The Bistrica under the old stone bridge called \\"Firduzova ƒÜuprija\\" at Duman (a.k.a. \\"Dumanska ƒÜuprija\\") and old watermills across the river, just downstream from its wellspring Vrelo Duman. It flows unregulated for roughly 6.3 kilometers through Livanjsko Polje before it reaches section from where the rest of its course it flows regulated through artificially created riverbed, which is simply excavated in soil. From that point river also changes its name, appropriately, to the Prokop, which in English literally translate as a trench, a ditch or dug out canal. Some 1.2 kilometers upstream from there the Bistrica receives the ≈Ωabljak river waters from the left. Further down the stream it receives the Sturba river, also from the left. After 14.9 kilometers the Bistrica than receives significant amount of waters from northwestern half of Livanjsko Polje, which is channeled through artificial canal named after existing river, the Plovuƒça, which still exists in that part of the polje (English: field). Hydropower and irrigation system At 20,3 kilometers the Bistrica finally reaches Lipsko Lake, near village of Lipa, which is first and smaller of two artificial reservoirs in hydroelectric power plant system Bu≈°ko Blato - HE Orlovac, other being Bu≈°ko Blato reservoir. In this system Lipsko Lake is a compensation basin and serves for regulation of an outflow of water toward intake facility at penstock station \\"Lipa\\" at the foot of Kame≈°nica mountain, and across the border into Croatia where hydroelectric power plant \\"HE Orlovac\\" is situated. Lipsko Lake is connected with much larger reservoir of Bu≈°ko Blato, whose head can rise above head of Lipsko Lake up to several meters, via the reversible canal of \\"Lipsko-Bu≈°ko\\" where it stores an excess waters from Livanjsko Polje and the Bistrica, especially during flooding season and high precipitation periods. For transfer of these waters over the barrage \\"Podgradina\\", at village Podgradina, into Bu≈°ko Blato reservoir, system uses reversible pumping station \\"Bu≈°ko Blato\\", built at the point where canal reaches barrage.

It is one of the eight social justice tribunals in Ontario. History Historically, landlord and tenant relations in Ontario were governed by the Landlord and Tenant Act. Disputes between landlords and tenants could only be formally addressed through the court system. In 1998, the Conservative government of Mike Harris enacted the Tenant Protection Act, which created a new regime governing residential tenancies. The act established the Ontario Rental Housing Tribunal as a quasi-judicial body to adjudicate disputes, thus largely removing landlord-tenant law from the court system. The act and the tribunal were criticized by some people as being biased in favour of landlords. In 2006, the Liberal government of Dalton McGuinty repealed the act and replaced it with the current Residential Tenancies Act, which also restructured and altered the rules of the tribunal and gave it its current name. Process Either landlords or tenants may file an application to the Board. The parties can choose to first attempt to resolve the matter through mediation. If the mediation is unsuccessful or if the parties choose not to attempt mediation, then an adjudication hearing is held in which a Board member hears evidence from both parties before issuing an order. A landlord may apply to the Board to increase a unit's rent above the province's rent control guidelines or to evict a tenant. Tenants can dispute evictions, apply for rent reductions or rebates due to a landlord's failure to meet maintenance obligations, apply for work orders or other orders, or grieve other violations of the Residential Tenancies Act. In Ontario a landlord cannot evict a tenant without a hearing before the board According to Whitney Miller of Social Justice Tribunals Ontario, the Board generally hears landlord applications for non-payment of rent within 25 days of filing the application, and a decision is usually issued within five days of the hearing.A landlord's nightmare: tenants kept livestock in the house, cbc.ca. , Landlords must pay Cambridge Tenant therecord.com. Legal representation In Ontario a person may be represented by an individual licensed by the Law Society of Upper Canada such as a lawyer or a paralegal. There are other exemptions for unpaid representatives such as direct employees of the landlord or in the case of a tenant a friend or family member. It is the obligation of the individual claiming the representation exemption to provide proof to the board of their legal authorization to represent a person or company in front of the board. Prior to a board hearing tenants are offered the opportunity to speak to tenant duty counsel that is usually provided by a community legal aid clinic funded through Legal Aid Ontario. Landlord are not allowed to access duty counsel on the hearing day. Jurisdiction According to the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 S.O the Board has the jurisdiction to resolve all matters between a Landlord & Tenant. There are a few important differences between applications made by landlords and applications made by tenants when it relates to matters of jurisdiction. Under the Act a tenant must be in possession of a rental unit prior filling an application with the board. If a landlord files an application with the board when a tenant is not in possession of the rental unit the application will be dismissed. If a landlord would like to make a claim against a tenant after a tenant has vacated the rental unit the landlord must seek compensation through the Ontario Small Claims Court. Changes at the Board In September 2016 changes were made to the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 S.O to allow victims of domestic violence to terminate their leases with only 28 days notice.

It is the third chapter of the Spanish Apartment trilogy, after L'Auberge Espagnole (2002) and Les Poup√©es russes (Russian Dolls, 2005). Plot Ten years have passed, and the once happy lovers, Xavier Rousseau (Romain Duris) and Wendy (Kelly Reilly), have split. When she moves with their two children to New York City, he also moves there to be near the children. Wendy now lives with John (Peter Hermann) in a luxury apartment overlooking Central Park. Xavier initially stays with Isabelle (C√©cile de France) and Ju (Sandrine Holt), a lesbian couple whose child he fathered, but he soon finds his own apartment above a Chinese bakery where he works on a new novel assisted by brief visions of Arthur Schopenhauer and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Having no work visa, Xavier is advised by his lawyer (Jason Kravits) to seek illegal employment and marry for a green card. After saving his taxicab driver from a vicious beating, the driver's grateful Chinese-American family agrees to have Xavier marry one of their relations, Nancy (Li Jun Li), who is amenable and complicit. His former French girlfriend, Martine (Audrey Tautou), visits him while on a business trip and returns a second time with her own two children on spring break. Xavier and Martine briefly attempt to rekindle their relationship. The film climaxes when the Immigration and Naturalization Service performs a surprise inspection of Xavier's apartment while Isabelle is using it to cheat on Ju with their babysitter (Flore Bonaventura). Later as Martine is departing for home with her kids, Xavier races on foot to catch her shuttle bus, confess his love, and ask her to stay and live with him. She agrees. The film concludes with the cast of characters walking in a celebratory parade down a Chinatown street.

Geography Its catchment lies between that of the River Blithe to the West, and the River Dove to the north, in a part of the county known as Needwood Forest. The Swarbourn and its tributaries, which include the Eland Brook, Mare brook and Lin Brook, drain a catchment area of . The source is near to the village of Marchington Woodlands, it flows southeast, and passes through Newborough, Hoar Cross, Woodmill, and Yoxall until it joins the River Trent between Wychnor Park and Alrewas. The Staffordshire long distance footpath called the Way for the Millennium follows the Swarbourn from Yoxall to its confluence with the Trent. Ecology The Swarbourn has been classed as having moderate ecological quality under the Water Framework Directive. This is the middle band on the five part framework scale, which ranges from high, good, and moderate, through to poor and bad. The river is unusual in that it supports a population of native White clawed crayfish in the upper reaches, which is an endangered species in the UK. In 2013, Crayfish plague was discovered in the lower parts of the river; the fungal plague is carried by the non-native American signal crayfish and is deadly to the native white clawed species. Efforts are being made to restrict the spread of the disease in order that the crayfish in the headwaters and in nearby ponds are not infected. Between Yoxall and Wychnor, a wetland woodland meadow has been created by felling a conifer plantation. Known as Swarbourn meadow, the wetland habitat is also the location for an artificial holt which has been constructed in order to attract otters from the Trent where they have previously been spotted.

There are currently 4 volumes (potentially 5) in some years to come. All volumes are standalone programs and can not be modified. Unlike most train simulations, the routes are short and modeled at near reality detail levels, each volume has only one route included with no other routes available with the exception of Volume 1. However the total amount of drivable track in Volume 1 is significantly less than other volumes with only 13.8 miles included.  World of Subways Volume 1: The PATH  Volume 1 takes place in the PATH (Port Authority Trans-Hudson) system. It covers the entire rail system of 22.2 km (13.8 mi) of track and 13 stations, which connects between the downtown areas in the borough of Manhattan in New York City and a few cities in the state of New Jersey. Usable rolling stock includes the refurbished PA2 and PA3 rail cars and the non-furbished PA4 rail cars. An expansion pack was released containing five new missions and additional options.  World of Subways Volume 2: U7 - Berlin  Volume 2 was the next product in continuing the successful World of Subways series. It takes place in the Berlin U-Bahn's U7 line, the longest line in the system covering 31.8 km (19.8 mi) and 40 stations between Rathaus Spandau and Rudow. Unlike the other volumes, the entire route is underground. Usable rolling stock includes the F 90 and the H 01 subway cars.  World of Subways Volume 3: London Underground Circle Line Volume 3 continues the World of Subways series with the Circle line service of the London Underground. The Circle Line covers 27 km (16.8 mi) of track and 35 stations, including the extension to Hammersmith, that runs above and below ground through London. The Circle Line operates in two directions: \\"Inner Rail\\" (anti-clockwise, Edgware Road - Hammersmith) and \\"Outer Rail\\" (clockwise, Hammersmith - Edgware Road). Unlike the previous volumes, players have a visible character in third-person view, but the majority of the simulation is still in first-person view. Also unlike the previous versions, there is no exterior camera and the player can board and travel on other Circle Line trains not controlled by the player. The only usable rolling stock is the C Stock subway cars. The D Stock is also included, which runs on the District line but the player can not board or control this type of rolling stock. The C Stock was also included on another line, the Hammersmith & City line and again the player can not board or control this train. World of Subways Volume 3 was praised for the trains looking very similar to their real-life counterparts. Unlike all the other volumes of this series, Volume 3 was published by Excalibur Publishing as well as Aerosoft.  World of Subways Volume 4: New York Line 7 Despite the fact that Aerosoft, the publisher of the series, announced that volume 4 would be set on a line on the Paris M√©tro, TML-Studios publicly released pictures and information that Volume 4 will instead be set on the New York City Subway system in New York City, based on the 7 service. Also, this will be the first time the series is not set in the era at the time of the release.

It involves testing beyond normal operational capacity, often to a breaking point, in order to observe the results. Reasons can include: to determine breaking points and safe usage limits; to confirm that the intended specifications are being met; to determine modes of failure (how exactly a system may fail), and to test stable operation of a part or system outside standard usage. Reliability engineers often test items under expected stress or even under accelerated stress in order to determine the operating life of the item or to determine modes of failure.Nelson, Wayne B., (2004), Accelerated Testing - Statistical Models, Test Plans, and Data Analysis, John Wiley & Sons, New York, The term stress test as it relates to hardware (including electronics, physical devices, nuclear power plants, etc.) is likely to have different refined meanings in specific contexts. One example is in materials, see Fatigue (material). Hardware stress test Stress testing, in general, should put computer hardware under exaggerated levels of stress in order to ensure stability when used in a normal environment. These can include extremes of workload, type of task, memory use, thermal load (heat), clock speed, or voltages. Memory and CPU are two components that are commonly stress tested in this way. There is considerable overlap between stress testing software and benchmarking software, since both seek to assess and measure maximum performance. Of the two, stress testing software aims to test stability by trying to force a system to fail; benchmarking aims to measure and assess the maximum performance possible at a given task or function. When modifying the operating parameters of a CPU, such as temperature, humidity, overclocking, underclocking, overvolting, and undervolting, it may be necessary to verify if the new parameters (usually CPU core voltage and frequency) are suitable for heavy CPU loads. This is done by running a CPU- intensive program for extended periods of time, to test whether the computer hangs or crashes. CPU stress testing is also referred to as torture testing. Software that is suitable for torture testing should typically run instructions that utilise the entire chip rather than only a few of its units. Stress testing a CPU over the course of 24 hours at 100% load is, in most cases, sufficient to determine that the CPU will function correctly in normal usage scenarios such as in a desktop computer, where CPU usage typically fluctuates at low levels (50% and under). Hardware stress testing and stability are subjective and may vary according to how the system will be used. A stress test for a system running 24/7 or that will perform error sensitive tasks such as distributed computing or \\"folding\\" projects may differ from one that needs to be able to run a single game with a reasonable amount of reliability. For example, a comprehensive guide on overclocking Sandy Bridge found that: (some text condensed) > Even though in the past IntelBurnTest was just as good, it seems that > something in the SB uArch [Sandy Bridge microarchitecture] is more heavily > stressed with Prime95 ... IBT really does pull more power [make greater > thermal demands]. But ... Prime95 failed first every time, and it failed > when IBT would pass. So same as Sandy Bridge, Prime95 is a better stability > tester for Sandy Bridge-E than IBT/LinX. Stability is subjective; some might > call stability enough to run their game, other like folders [folding > projects] might need something that is just as stable as it was at stock, > and ... would need to run Prime95 for at least 12 hours to a day or two to > deem that stable ... There are [bench testers] who really don‚Äôt care for > stability like that and will just say if it can [complete] a benchmark it is > stable enough. No one is wrong and no one is right. Stability is subjective. > [But] 24/7 stability is not subjective. An engineer at ASUS advised in a 2012 article on overclocking an Intel X79 system, that it is important to choose testing software carefully in order to obtain useful results: > Unvalidated stress tests are not advised (such as Prime95 or LinX or other > comparable applications). For high grade CPU/IMC and System Bus testing > Aida64 is recommended along with general applications usage like PC Mark 7. > Aida has an advantage as it is stability test has been designed for the > Sandy Bridge E architecture and test specific functions like AES, AVX and > other instruction sets that prime and like synthetics do not touch. As such > not only does it load the CPU 100% but will also test other parts of CPU not > used under applications like Prime 95. Other applications to consider are > SiSoft 2012 or Passmark BurnIn. Be advised validation has not been completed > using Prime 95 version 26 and LinX (10.3.7.012) and OCCT 4.1.0 beta 1 but > once we have internally tested to ensure at least limited support and > operation.

History=Ottoman era= During the late Ottoman era, in the late 1840s, Kaftin was a Druze village headed by a sheikh (\\"local chief\\") named Abu Sharif Nasif. At the time most of the once-large Druze community of A'la Mountain had fled the area after being embroiled in a feud between the two Muslim villages of Kafr Takharim and Armanaz in the early 19th-century. The weaker Muslim party had taken up safe haven with the Druzes of the area and the Druze consequently launched an attack on the stronger Muslim village. Soon after, however, the two Muslim factions declared a truce and together with Muslim fighters from Antioch they assaulted the Druze of A'la Mountain. The Druze were decisively defeated and their sheikh was killed resulting in a mass flight towards Mount Lebanon, the Hauran and Damascus. A small number of Druze had returned to Kaftin and A'la Mountain by the mid-19th-century.Bibliotheca Sacra, 1848, pp. 664-665. Kaftin was noted for its numerous pigeon houses where thousands of white pigeons would breed annually. In the 1790s English traveler William George Browne described the houses as \\"remarkable.\\"Browne, 1806, p. 439. When the young pigeons were able to fly, they would be collected and supplied to the markets of the nearby villages and Aleppo where they would be sold as valuable commodities. The pigeon houses were tall and narrow buildings, some of them reaching a height of 50 feet, and they numbered 72, although at the time the majority of them were in ruins.Bibliotheca Sacra, 1848, p. 666. In November 1875 a petition by the residents of Kaftin was sent to the British consul in Aleppo requesting intervention with the provincial Ottoman authorities of Aleppo who they accused of seizing and selling off their properties which they paid taxes for and planted olive trees on during the preceding generations.Firro, 1992, p. 166. =Syrian civil war= During the ongoing Syrian civil war, Kaftin's residents provided shelter for internal refugees. although the Idlib region (with the exception of Idlib and small pockets of territory) is largely under opposition control, the Free Syrian Army (FSA) had not entered Kaftin or other Druze villages because the villages maintained their neutrality in the conflict and host many displaced families from neighboring towns. However, towards the end of 2013, militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), a Salafist-jihadist organization, largely became dominant over the FSA and captured Kaftin along with other Druze-majority villages in area. They reportedly demanded that residents \\"announce their Islam\\" by converting their prayer houses into mosques and trimming their mustaches.

A wonderful collection of essays‚Ä¶\\"- Christopher Dom√≠nguez Michael, in Vuelta. \\"The essays in Hern√°ndez- Busto‚Äôs book recreate the figure and the work of a dozen influential reactionary authors ‚ÄìRussians, Americans, Europeans‚Äì; in several cases they are representative of a more or less eccentric far Right, all of them born in the late 19th century and reaching its zenith around the World War II. Of some of them, like C√©line, Gim√©nez Caballero or J√ºnger we already had some information. Others, like Rozanov or Julius Evola, were simple encyclopaedia notes, at least for me, and they are already gigantic figures, with their successes and mistakes. In this first and splendid book, Hern√°ndez Busto shows his talent as narrator, thinker and expert. It is unusual in these areas, and admirable, to see this simultaneous strength of ideas, style and knowledge\\" ‚ÄìIgnacio Vidal-Folch, in Tiempo. \\"Hern√°ndez-Busto is a Cuban who has made a brilliant work of intellectual archeology and has dug into the slime of that which is called the physiognomy of the 'intellectual', revealing what everybody knows and few dare to admit: that there are many ‚Äòright profiles‚Äô who loved the beauty and knowledge from the trenches where they were shooting at Progress. Nine authors, nine spirits of 'Evil' called together by an essayist awarded with the Essay Prize \\"Casa de Am√©rica\\"‚Ä¶ Roz√°nov, J√ºnger, Morand, Montherlant, C√©line, Pound, Evola, Vasconcelos and Gim√©nez Caballero ‚Ä¶ Nine fascinating pretexts to peep out at this abyss which, as Nietzsche would say, threatens us with peeping out inside ourselves\\" ‚ÄìJos√© Mar√≠a Lassalle, ABC. \\"Aware that the label of reactionary writer comprises many 'physiognomies', the author calls together here writers as diverse as J√ºnger, Gim√©nez Caballero and C√©line. With great stylistic will, he offers case studies of the right-wing writer that invite us to consider the unsettling relationship between literary lucidity and ideological irreverence, which so frequently triggers what he calls 'creative irrationalism' ‚Ä¶ The book shows a brightness as stimulating as accurate\\" ‚ÄìPau Centellas, El Peri√≥dico. \\"Hern√°ndez Busto has produced an excellent essay that dismisses any aspiration to exhaustiveness. There are many absences in this gallery, but he does not omit anything essential, and the analysis of each figure is bursting with shrewdness, genius and rigour.\\" ‚ÄìRafael Narbona, Revista de Libros. \\"It is remarkable not just the excellence of this book, which combines a wide literary culture with a sophisticated prose, but also its uniqueness in the still greyish landscape of the Cuban contemporary essay. Free of the academic point of view and the Cuban topics that prevail among our essayists, these 'Fisonom√≠as del escritor reaccionario' are so unique that they are truly eccentric\\". ‚ÄìDuanel D√≠az, Cubista Magazine. \\"Perfiles derechos resists the enlightened Kantian view of literature, that reads texts juridically, as always entailing a political vice or virtue, a crime or a moral benefit. How does he do it? Through an ethics of reading that embraces the literary values of the text as an autonomous field of meaning: as a space of escape and demarcation where the criticism of history can be absent. ‚Ä¶ Hern√°ndez Busto did not set out to write a treatise on right-wing literature in the 20s, 30s and 40s. His aim was just collect nine profiles, nine figures of writers, whose spiritual relationship becomes tangible in our reading. And this aim, this art of combining, performed by a young author who not for nothing studied Mathematics in Moscow, gets fully met in these 'Physiognomies.'‚Äù ‚ÄìRafael Rojas, in Encuentro de la Cultura Cubana. About Inventario de saldos (Inventory balances): \\"Inventory balances not only yields much less than it offers in its Introduction, but also notoriously misreads (not in the creative, Bloomian meaning, but in the common meaning) Bloom‚Äôs theory\\" ‚ÄìDuanel D√≠az, Cubaencuentro. \\"He reveals unknown corners of Cuban literature‚Ä¶\\" ‚ÄìWilliam Navarrete, El Nuevo Herald \\"Two general contents characterize their main concerns: the Cuban literary canon (its rereading) and a critical (and confessional) perspective of a writer marked by the phenomenon of the diaspora: the need to recreate from it a personal and generational account of the literary history of the Cuban nation\\" ‚ÄìJorge Luis Arcos, Cubaencuentro. About La ruta natural (The natural route): \\"Ernesto Hern√°ndez Busto is an author educated in the best literary traditions ‚Äìfrom the Baroque period to the modern Anglosaxon narrators‚Äì, whose prose is always elegant, fluent and balanced: it never gets unleashed, despite being spattered with sparks of lyricism and, sometimes, the electricity of sarcasm. ‚Ä¶ La ruta natural is a fortunate example of multifaceted, genre-proof, winding, interstitial literature, but at the same time, it rightly finds in this absence of hierarchy, in this liquid fragmentation, its best sit in reality and its most effective penetration in the ever fragile, ever desolate, privacy of men.\\" ‚ÄîEduardo Moga, in Cuadernos Hispanoamericanos. \\"Beautiful and suggestive book‚Ä¶\\" -Manuel Arranz, Turia. About Diario de Kioto (Kyoto Diaries): \\"Though he does not escape to the interpretative excitement that Japan provokes in the erudite and curious, the essayist narrator who joins this Diario de Kioto together with pieces of very different kind is not, fortunately, tempted to theory or absolute explanations; instead he prefers to amuse himself with reflections on what shows up in this journey: gestures, rituals, gardens, buildings, external and internal landscapes, books, memories, remorses and at each step, his own fragmented image in shattered mirrors. Kyoto is the place where meditation flows, but it is also magnetized by other fields, and in the sentence of the Sinologist David Hilton constantly quoted in these pages ‚ÄìWhat happens never happens enough‚Äì, the reader can read also a variation of the poem of Bash√¥: Even in Kyoto, I long for Kyoto. As a log book of an escape, ascesis and a sort of purgative path, this Diario lights up an unspoken question: How to be really here and now? When the reader closes its pages, the reader knows, with irrevocable certainty, that he has been in Kyoto\\". ‚ÄìAurelio Asiain.

Painted roughly 1550-1560, it depicts Jesus, Mary, Joseph, and John in a powerful, Mannerist style. Description This depiction of the Holy Family plus St. John has many Mannerist traits: vibrant colors, exaggerated monumentality, formal complexity, and awkward composition. The figures are all massive and muscular (particularly evident in St. John's arm), then crammed together for a composition which is highly expressive, if somewhat uncomfortable. Nosadella's Mannerist disregard for the sweetness and naturalism of earlier painters is particularly evident in the figures of Mary and Jesus. In a departure from the usual handling of this scene, Mary turns her back on the viewer rather than presenting the infant, who restlessly reaches back. This posture displays the torturous knot and bright colors on her dress, very Mannerist details. In comparison, Joseph and John have very contemplative, introverted postures considering their muscularity. Historical information For years, the attribution of this painting shifted between Nosadella and his master Pellegrino Tibaldi, as is the case with many of their works. However, while Pellegrino's works are more fluid, Nosadella gave his figures a great deal of energy and a certain tortured physicality. Thus, this work is now confidently attributed to the student, not the teacher. =Acquisition= The IMA acquired The Holy Family with Saint John the Baptist in 1966, courtesy of the Martha Delzell Memorial Fund.

His ability to master a wide range of media ‚Äì including oil paint, watercolor, marble, and wood ‚Äì helped Winter maintain his ideology of not reconciling to a single artistic approach. Winter successfully completed over 50 public art projects, with highlights including work at the AFL-CIO building in Washington, DC, the United States Air Force Academy Cadet Chapel in Colorado Springs, CO, and the United Nations General Assembly Building in New York, NY. The Long Island Museum of American Art, History, and Carriages is the largest repository of Winter's work. Biography Photo of Lumen Martin Winter's signature from one of his prints =Early life= The youngest of three children, Lumen Martin Winter was born December 12, 1908 in Ellery, Illinois to parents, William Grant Winter (1863-1945) and Blanche Nicholson Winter (1876-1909). His father was an engineer who designed farm equipment and wagons. Lumen's mother Blanche died when he was an infant. After Blanche's death, William Winter briefly put his children in an orphanage before moving the family to a ranch in Belpre, Kansas where he married Blanche's sister, Margaret. The ranch was located on the outskirts of the old Santa Fe Trail, where Winter observed seeing ruts in the ground from the countless early pioneer wagons that undertook the westward expansion journey in the 19th century. Just before entering high school in the early 1920s, Winter's family relocated to Grand Rapids, Michigan. =Education and early career= During his years at Union High School, Winter made a number of breakthroughs as a young artist. Some of his early work was published in The American Boy magazine and in the Grand Rapid Herald where he made $18 a week as a cartoonist and illustrator. Aging Apple Tree, oil on Masonite, 1947. The Long Island Museum. He created lobby posters at the Regent Theater and created art work for the Newspaper Engraving Company. After graduating from high school, Winter continued to work at the newspaper while being enrolled as a student at Grand Rapids Junior College. Winter would later be accepted and begin training at the Cleveland School of Art in 1928. In February 1929, Winter decided to pursue better artistic and personal fortunes in New York City; there he studied at the National Academy of Design under Impressionist; Ivan G. Olinksy and at the Grand Central School of Art under Abstract Expressionist; Arshile Gorky. He also trained under prominent illustrator, Walter K. Biggs. His most significant training would be under the eminent muralist Ezra Winter (no relation). Working under the elder Winter, Lumen assisted on major commissions that included the large, dramatic Fountain of Youth mural overlooking the grand foyer at Radio City Music Hall and the murals inside George Rogers Clark National Historical Park in Vincennes, Indiana. In the lean years of the Great Depression, Winter managed stints as an illustrator, including his work for Glenn Degner's book The Minute Epics of Flight (1932), a story of man's aspirations and achievements in flight over the millennia; several cover illustrations for Liberty magazine; and a poster for the United States Savings Bond program. =WPA Commissions= Some of his early projects were commissioned through President Roosevelt's New Deal initiative under the Works Progress Administration (WPA) during the 1930s and 40s. Under the WPA, Winter created post office murals in Fremont, Michigan; Hutchinson, Kansas; and St. Louis, Missouri. Cannes, from the deck of the SS Constitution, watercolor, 1955. The Long Island Museum CollectionHis mural created to decorate the historic Gwen B. Giles Station post office in St. Louis depicts the city's Old Levee and Market. The lively scene depicts a family trying to get out of the way of a stagecoach with unruly horses while two nearby men stand against a tree whose marker indicates Boone‚Äô Lick Trail that ran west from St. Louis to Arrow Rock. As this mural indicates, WPA commissions were based on local history themes that provided readable guides to each state and sought to instill local pride amid the atmosphere of despair caused by the Great Depression. The West Untitled, New Mexico desert, watercolor, 1951. The Long Island Museum collection. Winter's experiences living in the rural Midwest as a child left lasting impressions on his artistic direction, as many of his works themes included horizontal landscapes and horses. His time spent living there helped cultivate his love of wild nature. Throughout his life, Winter would periodically venture back to Northern New Mexico where he had built a studio in the desert, outside Taos, in 1939. He would travel along the Santa Fe Trail and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains where he found great inspiration from the flora and fauna of the region. Winter often did independent works based on his experiences in the countryside; capturing the saturated and diverse colors from different times of day, the textures of cacti, and the depth of the landscape, it was here that Winter felt he was most at home. Europe Lumen Martin Winter working on bas relief for The Conversion of St. Paul, Pietrasanta, Italy, 1958. The Long Island Museum collection.Throughout his early career, Winter had great ambition to travel to Europe and assimilate the practices and stylistic approaches he would learn there into his own unique style. He was denied the opportunity to do so until the spring of 1951 when Winter was commissioned to create a replica of Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper. In preparation for this major undertaking, Winter was given the chance to travel to Europe with his assistant, Frank McQuade. For seventeen days, they explored galleries, museums, and churches in Paris, Florence, Rome, Milan, and Vinci, Leonardo's home town. Lumen Martin Winter (center-right) leads the effort to carve marble panels for the National Wildlife Federation Building, Pietrasanta, Italy, 1960. The Long Island Museum collection.The project would take Winter and three assistants three and a half months of nearly 15 hour days, 7 days a week to complete. Winter relied on other Leonardo paintings for reference as well as a Montorfano fresco of the Crucifixion positioned directly across from The Last Supper. It would take over four hundred pounds of paint to complete. The result of Winter's dedication merited a great deal of interest. Originally displayed in the Horton Museum, the replica now resides in the South Dining Hall of the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. This project was the first in a long string of religious-oriented art created by Winter. The Leonardo project provided an additional education for Winter and it gave the artist an initial exposure to Europe which satisfied his lifelong dream to travel there and absorb insights and in-person influences from Renaissance masterworks. It also provided a solid footing in Italy for Winter who would continue to develop connections to a sculpture firm in Pietrasanta throughout the 1950s. His relationship with this firm allowed Winter to complete some of his most significant public art and sculpture projects and enabled him to use the extensive marble quarries nearby. Public artist Winters public career was driven greatly by the acclaim he achieved with his murals. In 1955, Winter was hired by the AFL-CIO to create a monumental glass mosaic mural, measuring 17√ó51 feet, for the lobby of the organization's new headquarters in Washington, D.C. The mural, consisting of 300,000 individual pieces, depicts a journey through America labor history. In 1973, Winter was invited back to AFL-CIO to create a companion mural for their new addition, on labor in the 20th-century space age.Central Figures in Sketch for AFI-CIO mural, red conte on paper, 1955. The Long Island Museum In 1961, Winter was hired to design and create thirteen carved marble and Venetian glass panels, each one 12 ft high by 4 ft wide, for the opening of the National Wildlife Federation Building. Dedicated by President John F. Kennedy on March 3, 1961, the glass covered marble depicted a total of 176 figures ‚Äì moose, bears, wolves, and birds of every description. Other Public Works: :*A 30√ó16 foot mural, titled Venus and Apollo, for the New York World's Fair Administration building, located below the fair‚Äôs heliport, in 1964. Winter used his twelve-year-old daughter Katie as the muse for Venus. :*Titans (1972), a pointillist-style 8√ó18 foot painting for the United Nations World Youth Assembly. The painting uses the color spectrum to represent the basic colors and creeds of all nations while depicting five giants representing the five continents moving the world out of darkness into light. :*Eight mural paintings on the second-floor rotunda of the Kansas State Capitol in Topeka, dedicated in 1978. :*The White Buffalo, an 8√ó8√ó5 foot marble sculpture of a buffalo, rearing horse and an Indian rider, based upon a Sioux legend, commissioned by the Kansas State Historical Society. Winter‚Äôs son, William completed the project due to Winter passing away before its completion. Family life After moving to New York City (Brooklyn) in 1929, Winter married his first wife Maxine Marie Panney. Their marriage ended in 1938. In 1940, Winter moved to Cincinnati where he met and had a relationship with Mary Elizabeth Mason. They had a son together, Thomas Martin Winter (Lumen Martin Winter II), on January 12, 1943. Winter would later marry Grace Harmon on March 13, 1948. They had a son, William Grant Winter (1949) and a daughter, Catherine Winter (1950). Final years Winter working on cartoon with the Ravenna Mosaic Company, for the AFL-CIO mural, Washington, DC, 1956. The Long Island Museum.Despite achieving many professional successes, Winter kept a low profile, spending relatively little money and devoting hours each day to his craft. Friends described a man who enjoyed jokes and was never overly solemn. Winter's studio was an active space, cluttered with half-finished watercolors and art books. On April 5, 1982, Lumen Martin Winter died of cardiac arrest at his home in New Rochelle at 73 years old.New York Times Obit  Locations of Notable Works  * General Assembly at the United Nations, Titans * Kansas Museum of History, Great White Buffalo * HSBC Bank, at Avenue U and East 17th Street, Brooklyn, New York.

History alt=The Windsor Arms Apartments The Windsor Arms Apartments was designed by architect Cecil Burgess and was completed on 1 April 1930 at the cost of $300,000 (1930 dollars), which the builder claimed to be 85% above the average cost of construction because of conveniences put into the structure. The building's design features a detailed entrance portico, stained and leaded glass windows, and wood-burning fireplaces in some units. When first tenanted, the building offered lobby and parking attendants and maid services. In June 1984, the then landlord informed tenants that the building would be sold for conversion into a form of condominium, in which purchasers would have bought units as tenants- in-common (with each owner having a stake in the property, without owning a specific part of the building), thereby sidestepping a municipal by-law preventing apartment-condominium conversations in place at the time. In November of the same year, it was reported that the tenants successfully fought off the conversion scheme, and the owner of the day confirmed that the condo development deal was \\"up the flue\\" and that it would be more profitable to convert the ground floor units into offices. The current property management, Andrex Holdings, has returned all units to residential occupancy. Designation & Restoration The building is a designated Category 1 heritage building within the Centretown Heritage Conservation District.

Autonomous works are not designed to glaze windows. The term \\"stained glass\\" commonly precedes \\"window\\" and is thus linked to architecture both linguistically and conceptually. The autonomous work is more like a painting than a stained glass window, and is a non- traditional use of the medium. One critic somewhat pejoratively calls non- architectural stained glass \\"uncommissioned panels.\\" Another traditionalist claims: \\"Stained glass can never be really satisfactory when considered as a bibelot to be hung up in the window or when sold in galleries like paintings for room decoration.\\"John Baker in Trevor Dannatt, ed., Architects‚Äô Yearbook 6, Elek Books, Ltd., London, 1955 From the Renaissance (Uccello, Ghiberti, Ghirlandaio), through the 18th and 19th centuries (Sir Joshua Reynolds, Delacroix), into the 20th century (Rouault, Chagall), artists have made windows in the style of their paintings. These windows look like paintings but they are windows that respond, to a greater or lesser degree, to the form, purpose, and mood of a building. Over time there have been scattered examples of works painted on small sheets of glass, sometimes assembled with lead, which were not designed to fill window openings. In Germany during the second half of the 20th century, studios began fabricating small panels for display in galleries and museums that were either similar in style to, or details of larger windows. Such panels are generally extensions of an architecturally accommodative aesthetic quite different from the \\"personal and introspective\\" approach of much contemporary painting and autonomous stained glass.Robert Kehlmann, \\"Glass as a Free Art Form,\\" Neues Glas, January, 1983 Theo van Doesburg, Piet Mondrian, Josef Albers and a handful of other early 20th- century artists did on occasion make autonomous stained glass works. Not until the early 1970s in the United States, however, did a group of stained glass artists devote themselves, in some instances exclusively, to such work.6\\\\. Casey Lewis, \\"Robert Kehlmann: Richmond Art Center, Richmond California,\\" Glass Art, Vol.4, No. 1976 Like painters, they used the medium in expressive, personal ways, designing and executing their own work rather than having them made by outside studios as is common with architectural stained glass windows. The first generation of American artists working autonomously with stained glass was documented in the landmark 1978 exhibition \\"New Stained Glass\\" at New York‚Äôs Museum of Contemporary Crafts.\\"New Stained Glass,\\" Museum of Contemporary Crafts, New York, 1978 (catalog) Subsequently others, worldwide, have devoted themselves to making autonomous stained glass.Robert Kehlmann, \\"Stained Glass as a Non-Architectural Art,\\" Glass Art Magazine, December, 1975 In the book Twentieth Century Stained Glass: A New Definition, art critic Robert Kehlmann points out that making a stained glass panel and designing a window are two different disciplines. Autonomous glass artists generally fabricate their own work, very often experimenting with materials, technique, and the uses of light. They freely \\"address a wide range of ideas and feelings without concern for the form and mood of a building.\\" The size, shape and imagery of an autonomous stained glass work is \\"dictated solely by the nature of materials and personal aesthetics.\\" File:Robert Kehlmann, Composition XXXIX (1977), 33 X 38, Leigh Yawkey Woodson Art Museum, Wausau, WI.jpg|Robert Kehlmann, Composition XXXIX (1977), 33 X 38, Leigh Yawkey Woodson Art Museum, Wausau, WI File:Peter Mollica, Glass Drawing 1a, (1977), destroyed.jpg|Peter Mollica, Glass Drawing 1a, (1977), destroyed File:Wilhelmy American Flag Glass Pipe Organ.jpg|The Wilhelmy American Flag Glass Pipe Organ File:Casey Lewis, Harpo Marx (1976) 26 X 26, Corning Museum of Glass.jpg|Casey Lewis, Harpo Marx (1976) 26 X 26, Corning Museum of Glass File:Richard Posner, Persistence of Vision (1975), Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|Richard Posner, Persistence of Vision (1975), Metropolitan Museum of Art References Autonomous Stained Glass Glass architecture History of glass Windows Glass art ","title":"Autonomous stained glass"},{"id":"38629016","text":"Charles Molloy may refer to: * Charles Molloy (journalist) (died 1767), Irish journalist, political activist and minor playwright * Charles Molloy (lawyer) (1640‚Äì1690), Irish lawyer known as a writer on maritime law ","title":"Charles Molloy"},{"id":"38629018","text":"Elk Hills Elementary School District is a public school district based in Kern County, California.

She was best known for her stage shows at the Roxy Theater. Early life and education Koner was born in 1912 in New York City to Russian Jewish immigrants. Her father, Samuel Koner, a lawyer, was noted for the medical plan he created for the Workmen's Circle, a Jewish socialist and benevolent organization. After seeing Anna Pavlova in The Dying Swan, Koner was inspired to become a dancer. She studied ballet under Michel Fokine in the 1920s; her father \\"paid\\" for the high-priced lessons by offering legal services in exchange. Koner later studied under Angel Cansino. She was a student of the Spanish dance form, as well as the fusion of Asian and Western dance popularized by Japanese choreographers Michio It≈ç and Yeichi Nimura. Career=Dancer and choreographer= Koner's first choreographed piece was presented on December 7, 1930 at the Guild Theatre. She worked as a soloist for 15 years, specializing in ballet, Asian dance, and Spanish dance. Among the countries she toured were Egypt and Palestine in 1932, and the Soviet Union from 1934 to 1936, where she taught as well as performed. After the war, she danced in several companies, including Fokine's, Ito's (1928‚Äì29), and Jos√© Lim√≥n's (1946-1960). With Kitty Doner, Koner developed 11 \\"Choreotones\\" for CBS television in 1945. She also produced stage shows at the Roxy Theater and several ice revues, including \\"Holiday on Ice\\". She was associated with Doris Humphrey after World War II; she choreographed her best- known dance, The Farewell (1962), in honor of Humphrey. =Teacher= Koner stopped performing in 1972, but continued to teach in India, Japan, Korea, and Singapore. She led the Pauline Koner Dance Consort from 1976 to 1982. Beginning in 1986, she became a regular lecturer at the Juilliard School. Her teaching and choreography continue to be recognized, especially her course, Elements of Performing, which she gave at the North Carolina School of the Arts, American Dance Festival, and schools in the US, Europe and Asia. This course focused on performance elements such as \\"motivation, emotion, focus, dynamics and the use of props, fabrics, lights and sound\\". She published her autobiography, Solitary Song, in 1989, and Elements of Performance in 1993. Awards and honors Koner received the 1963 Dance Magazine award. She also received an honorary degree from Rhode Island College. Personal She married Fritz Mahler in 1939. He died in 1973; she died on February 8, 2001 in Manhattan.

Only two were built. Design and development The Gipsy powered P-1 and P-2 were also known as the Pander-Gipsy and the Pander Supersport. The two almost identical aircraft were parasol monoplanes. The wing was slightly tapered with rounded wing tips, mounted over the fuselage by a pair of parallel struts on each side from the forward and aft wing spars to the lower fuselage longerons. Centrally, over the fuselage, wing support was provided by four forward and two aft cabane struts. The forward fuselage of the P-1 and -2 was rounded with its 100 hp (75 kW) Gipsy upright inline engine in tapering cowlings, the cylinder heads under a fairing with an open front end for cooling. The forward open cockpit was under the wing and the rear one at the trailing edge which had a cut-out providing an enhanced field of view. Behind the cockpits the fuselage became more flat sided, though rounded upper and lower decking made it appear oval. A braced tailplane was attached at mid fuselage height; the fin had a rounded leading edge but the rudder trailing edge was straight and upright. The undercarriage was fixed and conventional, the mainwheels on axles which were hinged from the lower longerons and curved to the horizontal at their extremities. Vertical compression legs were attached to the forward wing bracing struts, which were jury strut braced at the junction, and an inverted V-form strut hinged to the central fuselage provided lateral stability. There was a long, near vertical tail skid. Operational history Both aircraft were first registered in June 1929, P-1 in private hands and P-2 in the name of Pander & Sons. Only two months later P-1 was lost in a crash which killed its owner. P-2 flew with Pander until 1933, appearing at air shows and races; for example, it won one race in Biarritz in 1930 and came second in another in Bristol in the same year. In 1933 it was sold to a private owner for restoration and reputedly shipped to the US, though there are no records of its further activity.

She moved to North Hollywood, Los Angeles with her parents at the age of 10 and attended North Hollywood High School. Her father, Canadian World War I veteran, Captain Alfred Benson Laing, was a builder and writer for trade journals, and her mother, Nora Laing, was an entertainment correspondent for numerous international publications and co-founder of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA). Discussions regarding the formation of the HFPA, which presented the first annual Golden Globe Awards ceremony in 1944, are said to have taken place at the dining room table in her childhood home. Hollywood Foreign Press Association Dragone wrote for numerous international newspapers and magazines and was said to have interviewed hundreds of celebrities throughout the course of her career. She was a member of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for more than 50 years and was regarded as the \\"recognized historian\\" of the HFPA. In 2005, Dragone authored the book Who Makes the Golden Globes Go Around? which chronicled the history of the HFPA and its annual Golden Globe Awards ceremony. Prior to her death in 2013, she was the only living HFPA member to have attended all 70 Golden Globes ceremonies and was bestowed with an honorary \\"lifetime membership\\" to the association. Young Artist Association In 1978, Dragone founded the Youth in Film Association (now known as the Young Artist Association), which presents Hollywood's annual Young Artist Awards to specifically recognize and honor outstanding contributions of child stars working within the entertainment industry who might otherwise be overlooked for other industry awards when judged alongside their adult counterparts. The association also sponsors the Young Artist Foundation which grants scholarships to young performers who may be physically and/or financially challenged, enabling them to attend a performing arts school of their choice. As of 2013, the Young Artist Awards and the Young Artist Foundation scholarship fund are still presented annually. Personal life Dragone lived in North Hollywood, Los Angeles for the majority of her life and was married to Michael Dragone until his death in 1986. She had two children; Michael, Jr. and Shirley. She had three grandchildren; Heather, Holly and Frank, and four great-grandchildren; Samantha, Don, Alexandra and Benjamin. In 1987, Dragone became the companion of Dan Kitchel, whom she would remain with for the next 25 years, until her death in 2013. In one of her final statements, Dragone was quoted as saying, \\"I did everything that I ever wanted to do, and did it my way.\\" Death Dragone died on February 8, 2013 at a hospice in Los Angeles following a brief illness. After her death, a statement was posted on the HFPA's Golden Globes website, which read, \\"She will be missed, and was loved by so many people.\\" The Young Artist Association that she founded announced its plans to feature a memorial tribute at the 34th Annual Young Artist Awards ceremony in her honor.

His illustrations have been a regular fixture in the British national daily newspaper The Guardian since 1989, and he has also contributed to the English-language newspapers and magazines The New York Times, The Sunday Telegraph, The Times, International Herald Tribune, New Scientist, The Independent on Sunday, The Bookseller, New Statesman, Modern Painters, Campaign, The Listener, New Society and Story Teller. He won the Victoria and Albert Museum Award for Illustration in 1996, and the Ranan Lurie Political Cartoon Award in 2003. Life and career=Early life and career in Poland= Andrzej Krauze was born in Dawidy Bankowe, a village at the outskirts of Warsaw, Poland, on 7 March 1947. His father was a small trader and there was no artistic tradition in the family. But his elder brother Antoni had become a film director and Krauze intended to follow him. Film school demanded a degree, so Krauze, who had always loved drawing, began studying painting and illustration at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw in 1967. In 1971, while still a student, he started contributing cartoons to the Polish satirical magazine Szpilki and won first prize in a poster design competition organised by the National Theatre in Warsaw for whom he then worked as a poster designer until 1973, when he graduated. His diploma submission, an animated film entitled The Flying Lesson, was suppressed as anti-Polish and not shown publicly until 2010, but his growing success marked the end of his original ambition to become a film director, and, after graduating, he continued contributing to Szpilki and began working as a political cartoonist for the weekly magazine Kultura. Many of his cartoons were censored, but Krauze found this a creative challenge and spent the next six years irritating the censors and entertaining his readers. \\"He was a cult artist,\\" recalled Wojciech Chmurzynski, director of Warsaw's Museum of Caricature, in 2001: \\"He was very important to [Polish] people in the 1970s, and his ... cartoons were universally known.\\" Zuzanna Lipinska, daughter of the Museum of Caricature's founder, agrees: \\"Cartoons were important because there were a lot of things that couldn't be said directly, so people had to find metaphorical ways of saying them. [Krauze] was expressing the younger generation's discontent with the regime... He caught the tragicomic reality of Poland; the absurdity of Polish life.\\" =Career in Europe and move to London= By the end of the 1970s, Krauze decided to try his luck abroad. He continued to contribute to Kultura, but in 1979 he moved to Paris and, after only a month, to London. After a year there, however, the Home Office refused to extend his visa, forcing him to move to Amsterdam in 1980, where he worked as an illustrator for the Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad. From Amsterdam he moved back to Paris once again, where he contributed to the French magazines L'Express, L'Expansion and Lire in 1981. When martial law was declared in Poland in December 1981, he was once again in London organising an exhibition of his drawings. As he later recalled, \\"I said to myself, if I am a political cartoonist, this is my time. I only had a one-week tourist visa to begin with, but after martial law I published a lot of drawings in English, American and French newspapers, and immediately it was impossible to return [to Poland]. The borders were closed, it was very difficult to send journalists to Poland, there were no photographs coming out, and I was one of the few artists who could draw without fear.\\" =Career in Great Britain= Krauze remained in London and became a British citizen. Between 1986 and 1990 he designed posters for London's Old Vic theatre, then under the directorship of Jonathan Miller, and began contributing cartoons and illustrations to the New Statesman in 1988, The Guardian in 1989, and The Independent on Sunday in 1990. He has also contributed to the English-language newspapers and magazines The New York Times, The Sunday Telegraph, The Times, International Herald Tribune, New Scientist, The Bookseller, Modern Painters, Campaign, The Listener, New Society and Story Teller. He won the Victoria and Albert Museum Award for Illustration in 1996, was appointed external examiner by the Royal College of Art in 1997, and was awarded the Ranan Lurie Political Cartoon Award by the United Nations Correspondents Association in 2003. =Return to Poland= In 2001, Krauze returned to Poland as an artist for the first time in 20 years, with a critically acclaimed exhibition in the Museum of Caricature, Warsaw, attended by the British ambassador and the celebrated Polish film director Andrzej Wajda among others. He has since been widely published in Polish newspapers and weeklies, such as Rzeczpospolita and wSieci, as well as regularly having notable exhibitions in Warsaw. In 2017, he was honoured with the President Lech Kaczynski Award for outstanding contributions to Polish art and culture, along with his brother, film director Antoni Krauze, at the VII Congress of the Polish Great Project in Warsaw. Andrzej Krauze was further named a laureate of Polish art and awarded the Gold Medal for Merit to Culture ‚Äì Gloria Artis, which is the highest distinction that the Minister of Culture can give to an artist on behalf of the Polish Republic. Krauze lives in London. He continues to have his work published widely in both England and Poland and has recently exhibited in Warsaw and Tuscany. Critical responses to work Cultural historian Patrick Wright, whose book On Living in an Old Country (1985) Krauze illustrated, recalls of Krauze's early work that it was \\"like nothing else in Britain at that time... Many of [his drawings] were defiantly crude onslaughts, which used strong ink lines and ferocious cross- hatching to emphasise the violence of the Communist state and then hurl it back in the face of the regime... [H]is eye seemed harsher, and sometimes frankly disrespectful of the foibles and eccentricities of British life. His drawings lacked the cool 'designer' cynicism of an age increasingly defined by advertising imagery... [He was] an illustrator with a more distanced eye than was customary in English illustration.\\" Alan Rusbridger, editor of The Guardian, has similarly commented that Krauze \\"helped introduce an intelligence and sophistication into serious British illustration.\\" Journalist Francis Wheen has written of Krauze that \\"whatever [his] subject ... his ironic, cosmopolitan intelligence never fails to enlighten... Krauze can do caricatures and jokes, of course, but his real genius lies in the creation of vivid metaphor... absurd, sometimes scary imagery that owes more to writers such as Bulgakov or Alfred Jarry than to Jak or Mac... this is a man who both works hard and thinks hard, as proved by his dozens of brilliantly apt drawings in the book Introducing The Enlightenment [2000]... Krauze is both an artist and an intellectual; but he wears his learning lightly. Like all good intellectuals, he keeps Occam's razor within easy reach, ready to slash through obfuscation and reveal a plain truth in all its simplicity ‚Äì or perhaps one should say 'in black and white', since he employs black ink more tellingly than any other illustrator I know... this remarkable artist has always accepted the duty that is more traditionally assigned to journalists, though many of them prefer to duck the challenge: he speaks truth to power.\\" Selected books illustrated by Andrzej Krauze * Krauze, Andrzej (1977).

Dr. Okumura began his professional career in 1950 with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation (NTT, now privatised), where he collected radio propagation data in the 150 to 1920 MHz bands. These bands were later identified as appropriate for mobile phone systems (in no small part, because of the data collected by Okumura). Okumura's careful study in various topographical environments in metropolitan, suburban, rural and even mountainous regions at distances from 1 to 100 km was published in 1968. Y. Okumura, Field strength and its variability in VHF and UHF land-mobile radio service, Electrical Communication Laboratory, Vol 16, Number 9-10, 1968. His 10-year survey included varying the height of the antennas from ground level to 10 meters which helps in planning radio coverage of mobile phone cell towers. Okumura's work was advanced in the International Radio Consultative Conference (CCIR) which recognized that this work was applicable to all countries contemplating mobile cellular phone systems. The curves he published have become known as the Okumura Model and were critical to identifying the 800 MHz band as an appropriate target for mobile phone operation. About 1970, Okumura was promoted to the directorship of the Mobile System Research Section of the Electrical Communication Laboratory (ECL) of NTT. His staff grew to about 20 individuals, who pioneered the early high capacity cellular phone systems. Okumura retired from the ECL in 1975 and joined Toshiba.

It was first described by R. C. Gallon in 2005, and is endemic to Mauritius. Taxonomy The genus and species were first described by Richard Gallon in 2005. The genus name \\"Mascaraneus\\" means \\"spider of the Mascarene Islands\\"; mixing the word \\"Mascarene\\" with the Latin word for \\"spider\\" araneus. The specific name remotus is derived from the Latin word for \\"remote\\", referring to the isolated type locality (Serpent Island). The holotype of Mascaraneus remotus is desiccated, missing the third right leg. It lacks any stridulatory setae, and was therefore considered as ischnocoline but was not placed there, on account of the lack of any medial and proximal hairs on the tibial leg sections, and the presence of integral tarsal scopulae.  Lack of a stridulatory organ  An interesting feature of Mascaraneus remotus is the lack of any stridulatory organ on the upper prolateral surfaces of the first two coxae of the legs. Such an organ, consisting of many robust setae and long plumose setae, is found on nearly every eumenophorine theraphosid (with the exception being Monocentropus that only has plumose setae). As a near constant rule, large terrestrial theraphosids have a stridulatory organs of some shape or form. It has been suggested by some (for example, James Wood-Mason, in 1877Wood-Mason, J. (1877). Note on Mygale stridulans. Transactions of the Entomological Society of London 1877: 281-282) that this is used to deter predators. The tiny islet of Serpent Island has only one type of mammal, bats, and the birds of the islet are all diurnal (active by day), therefore they rarely come into contact with the tarantula. This may have led to the lack of the stridulatory organ.  Origins  Mascaraneus remotus is thought to have come from Madagascar, as during the Pleistocene age the Mascarene Plateau was exposed, with sea level rise, island hopping and local extinction causing its current distribution on the islet of Serpent Island. Another theory is that it came from Eastern Africa, but this is unlikely, as then one would expect eumenophorine tarantulas distributed on the Seychelles, from which only ischnocoline theraphosids are known. Furthermore, several species of Eumenophorinae are found on Madagascar, providing more evidence for the former theory.

Description Myostola occidentalis is basically dark brown, with pale rose- coloured hairs on the joints of the palps and legs. The female's body, including the mandibles, is around long; the male is smaller, at around and lighter in colour. Taxonomy Myostola occidentalis was first described by Hippolyte Lucas in 1858. He placed it in the now obsolete genus Mygale as Mygale occidentalis, comparing it to the New World species Mygale cancerides (now Phormictopus cancerides). In 1899, Reginald Innes Pocock transferred the species to the African genus Phoneyusa. In 1892, Eug√®ne Simon gave a description of the genus Pelinobius, but in 1903 realized that the species he used for the description was actually very different from the type species of Pelinobius (P. muticus) and was probably identical to Lucas's Mygale occidentalis. Accordingly, Simon provided a new genus name, Myostola, to replace his version of Pelinobius. Simon's decision to place M. occidentalis in a separate genus, rather than in Phoneyusa, was supported by Robert Raven in 1985.

He spent more than 20 years with the United States Bureau of Reclamation and was in charge of Hoover Dam and the surrounding park land for four years. From 1933 to 1954, Douglass worked for the Bureau of Reclamation. He prepared construction drawings for Hoover Dam and other aspects of the Boulder Canyon Project. During the mid-1940s, he was an Assistant Regional Director with responsibility for the Davis Dam 67 miles downstream from Hoover Dam. In 1949, he was sent to Japan where he prepared a study and recommendations for the design and construction of dams and irrigation works. From 1950 to 1954, he served as the Director of Power at Hoover Dam, overseeing the installation of three new generating units, including the first to have a solid stainless steel turbine runner. Douglass also served in the United States Army Quartermaster Corps during World War I, with responsibility for the construction of Army hospitals at Leon Springs, Texas, as well as U.S. Army General Hospital No. 7 in Baltimore, Maryland, and at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan. He also served three years as the City Engineer in Henderson, Nevada, in the 1950s, and was the Chairman of the Colorado River Advisory Board. Early years Douglass was born in 1888 in The Territory of The Indian Nations at what later became Gallup, New Mexico. Douglass was reportedly \\"proud of his pioneer heritage\\" and frequently spoke about \\"the frontier skills\\" he learned as a boy.

He was initially charged with responsibility for sewers, sewage disposal and cantonments at Leon Springs, Texas (near San Antonio). He was next put in charge of the construction of Army hospitals at Leon Springs as well as U.S. Army General Hospital No. 7 at Roland Park, Baltimore, Maryland and Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan. He received his discharge from the Army in June 1919. After World War I, Douglass moved to Dearborn, Michigan where he worked as an engineer with a subsidiary of the Ford Motor Company. He later formed, and served as president of, the firm of Douglass, Corey and Fish Engineers with offices in Denver, Trinidad, and Walsenburg, Colorado. In 1933, Douglass was hired as a design engineer by the Denver office of the United States Bureau of Reclamation, he was assigned to the civil engineering office. When he joined the Bureau, construction of the Hoover Dam was underway, and he was assigned to preparation of construction drawings for the Boulder Canyon (Hoover Dam) Project. He spent more than 20 years with the Bureau of Reclamation until his retirement in 1954. Douglass was eventually placed in charge of Hoover Dam and the surrounding park land from 1950 to 1954. Among Douglass's other works, he designed the roof for the Bureau of Reclamation's power house at the hydroelectric project near Boulder City, Nevada. The roof was \\"engineered to withstand the force of boulders that might fall from the rock walls near the dam.\\" In 1939, he published a paper entitled, \\"Accident Occurrence and Control on Heavy Construction of the Bureau of Reclamation.\\" In February 1944, Douglass was assigned to Washington, D.C., as Engineering Assistant to the Commissioner of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. A former colleague later recalled Douglass's brief stint in Washington as follows: > \\"Lou Douglass was the representative of the Commissioner of Reclamation at > the meetings of the Tripartite Agreement, but he decided early on after just > a few months that the Washington maelstrom was not his cup of tea. He liked > to know what he was going to do today, tomorrow, and next week. But that > hectic activity in Washington, you never knew what you were going to do in > the next fifteen minutes. So he saw an opportunity to transfer as an > Assistant Regional Director at Region III to Boulder City.\\" In October 1944, he was assigned to Boulder City, Nevada as Assistant Regional Director of the Bureau's newly formed Region III. During this time, Douglass was responsible for \\"a major part of the administrative and engineering responsibility\\" for the Davis Dam project being built 67 miles downstream from Hoover Dam. He was considered \\"an authority on the Davis Dam and park land.\\" SCAP headquarters in Tokyo, c. 1950 At the end of 1948, Douglass was sent to Japan as a consultant to the natural resources section of the general headquarters of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers in Japan under Gen. Douglas MacArthur. He prepared a study and recommendations for the design and construction of dams and irrigation works in Japan. He was awarded a citation for outstanding service by the G.H.Q. for his work in Japan. In 1950, Douglass became the Director of Power at Hoover Dam. In that capacity, he supervised the installation of three new generating units (A-3, A-4, and A-9) at the Arizona wing of the power plant. The A-9 unit was noted for being the first at Hoover Dam to have a solid stainless steel turbine runner. Douglass retired from the Bureau in 1954. At the time of his retirement, Douglass received the United States Department of the Interior Distinguished Service Citation and Gold Medal \\"for outstanding contributions in the field of water conservation and control.\\" After retiring from the Bureau, Douglass served three years as the City Engineer in Henderson, Nevada. He was also the Chairman of the Colorado River Advisory Board. Family, community service and later years He was married to Amelia Fredericka Hindman. They had a son, Frederick, and a daughter, Florence Elizabeth. His first wife died in childbirth in 1919. Douglass was later married to Norma Douglass in August 1922 at Trinidad, Colorado. He was a member of the Masonic Order, Rotary International, the American Legion, the American Society of Civil Engineers, Sigma Nu, the Teknik Club of Denver, and Chi Epsilon. He was a past president of the local Rotary Club and of the Boulder City Shrine Club. He was also the District Chairman of the Boulder Dam Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America, the president of the Board of Boulder City Hospital for six years, and a member of the Boulder City School Board in the 1950s. Douglass was a member of St. Christopher's Episcopal Church in Boulder City and served as a Junior Warden from 1955 to 1960. In his retirement, he built a mahogany pulpit, lectern, prayer desk, and baptismal font for the church. Douglass was also a popular speaker in the Boulder City area, known as \\"a raconteur\\" who, \\"[a]t the drop of a hat ... could come up with a story for just about any occasion.\\" In his later years, Douglass and his wife resided at the Boulder City Care Center. He died in Boulder City in 1979 at age 90. He was buried at Trinidad, Colorado.

Architecture Like many other monuments of Azerbaijan, Imamzadeh complex also was built in a manner of the 17th-18th centuries, peculiar to the period of the Safavids. The earliest burial vaults and mosques constructed near them are the main features of such complexes. The square-shaped mausoleum reminding of a vault with a cupola and a tower-mausoleum is a kernel of Imamzadeh complex of Nakhchivan. A decorative solution of a cylindrical body is analogical to Barda Mausoleum (1322) built by Ahmad ibn Eyyub, an architect from Nakhchivan. According to an inscription fixed on the entrance of the mausoleum, its construction began in 1722 and finished in 1732. The architectural monument in the SE of Nakhchivan c. Formed in 16- 18 centuries. Consists of 3 rooms. The base of the complex in plan is squareshaped, but outer view consists of the composition that the round base coming from the cubic formed towered tombs joining (see Imamzadeh tomb). The building joining the tomb, a bit bigger and having an entrance door from the W forms the central part. For the Russian scientist V.M.Sisoyev who was in Nakhchivan in 20 years of the last century this part of the complex was considered the tomb of the Nakhchivani khans.S a l a m z a d e h A.V., M a m m a d z a d e h K.Nakhchivan schooling monuments of the Azerbaijan architectureB., 1985 For the witness of the scientist there was a grave of Mustafagulu khan Nakhchivanski, the dead son of Abbasgulu khan by hijri 1337 (1918). But from time to time this and other graves were destroyed. A bit far from the complex in the N direction there is another tomb. The tomb built of burnt bricks, from the down squareshaped and in the upper part was built of multiangular shaped and its roof was covered with a dome. Compared with other constructions included to the complex this tomb was in a good order. But having not any inscription or grave inside its appointment was left uncertained. The buildings included in the Imamzadeh complex had harmony with one another and made a perfect architectural ensemble. There was a cemetery about the Middle Ages around the complex. From time to time some graves here were destroyed, but some others had been living up today. Grave inscriptions belonging to 16 century discovered from under the land had been investigated. Also spanshed vaults built of burnt bricks were come across here. Later on the place of the necropolis was changed and passed to the hill near the monument. Members of some mystic sects acting in the Middle Ages in this territory for a while had used of this complex to live, to pray, to resolve as a settlement. Generally the characteristic features of this type constructions consist of: repairing the funeral buildings existed before, restoration and construction by means of reconstruction, and by means of building others - mosque, blessing and other service rooms close to the tomb and by this way to establish the religion complex. As in 17-18 centuries the members of mystic sects acting in our territory used the existing imamzadehs as places to live, to pray and to remember.

It originally aired on CBS in the United States on February 19, 2013. The episode is written by Nicole Mirante-Matthews and directed by Tony Wharmby, and was seen by 21.08 million viewers. In the episode, a marine is found dead at a Navy Base. Soon it's discovered he was involved on an illegal fight club. Plot The team is called to investigate the death of a Marine private during training, and discover he had suffered a number of wounds from repeated beatings and stabbings. They initially believe the injuries were received due to his participation in an underground fighting ring, but he had not been in a fight in months. The death of another Marine private who shows similar wounds leads the team to the privates' commanding officer. They discover that the CO's brother was tortured and killed in Iraq, and he was trying to \\"toughen\\" up his men in preparation for what they might face in battle. Meanwhile, Vance discovers that Jackie had secretly set up her own bank account and hired a lawyer to draft a Separation of Property letter. Worried, Vance consults Gibbs, who tells him that Jackie was most likely afraid that Vance would die in the line of duty, and prepared accordingly, since Shannon did the same thing when he was in the Marine Corps. Vance is still unsure of what to do with his life without Jackie, though Gibbs reminds him that he still has his two children to take care of, giving him a purpose. Production The episode focused on Rocky Carroll's character Leon Vance.\\"Hereafter\\" was written by Nicole Mirante-Matthews and directed by Tony Wharmby. The tenth season's theme \\"Fallen Heroes\\" has hit both Ziva and Vance hard. According to Mirante- Matthews, in this episode Leon Vance's process to \\"come back stronger than before\\" begins. Rocky Carroll, who portrays Leon Vance, told TV Guide that \\"[Vance] thought he knew everything about his wife and then finds out that she was basically keeping an aspect of herself from her husband\\". The \\"recovery and rebirth\\" of the character is connected to the same experience Gibbs had with his wife Shannon, making Gibbs \\"pull [Vance] back from [the] brink\\" after questioning his wife's intentions. The death of Jackie is \\"going to give [Vance] a much deeper understanding about Gibbs and what Gibbs has experienced and how he has lived his life since losing his family\\", Carroll continued. Reception \\"Hereafter\\" was seen by 21.08 million live viewers following its broadcast on February 19, 2013, with a 3.5/10 share among adults aged 18 to 49. A rating point represents one percent of the total number of television sets in American households, and a share means the percentage of television sets in use tuned to the program. In total viewers, \\"Hereafter\\" easily won NCIS and CBS the night.

It was established in 2012 and is part of the Houston Independent School District (HISD). The school's current campus in the St. George Place area of Houston opened in August 2016; it was previously located in the former Maud Gordon Elementary School in Bellaire, Texas.\\"Home.\\" Mandarin Chinese Language Immersion Magnet School. Retrieved on February 23, 2013. \\"6300 Avenue B Bellaire, Texas 77401\\"  History  Former campus (vacated before fall 2016). The school opened in the former Maud W. Gordon Elementary School. Before 2012, Gordon had no zoning boundary of its own and it drew excess students from apartments west of Bellaire, in Houston, to relieve other schools in Houston west of Bellaire such as Benavidez, Cunningham, Elrod, and Milne. From its opening to 1953 to 1983, Gordon served as a neighborhood school. After its closure, Gordon temporarily housed the Post Oak School and later served as administrative offices. It re-opened as a relief school in 1988 for Elrod and Cunningham schools. It was scheduled to re-open in September 1988. Harvin C. Moore, a HISD board member, took two education- related trips to China and visited a Chinese immersion program in San Diego, California. Since then, he advocated for the creation of a Mandarin speaking magnet program. In 2011, the HISD board approved the creation of a Mandarin Chinese-language immersion magnet school in the former Holden Elementary in the Houston Heights. As of January 2012, the plans changed, and now the school was to open in Bellaire. In May 2012, the HISD board voted to spend $440,000 to renovate the Gordon campus. The school was scheduled to open in August 2012 with grades Kindergarten through 2. The first principal was Bryan Bordelon, previously a teacher at Scarborough High School. The previous Gordon Elementary program was being phased out year by year. In 2017, HISD announced plans to demolish the former MIMS campus so Bellaire High School's baseball practice field could be relocated there, allowing HISD to easily rebuild the high school main campus. The new campus for the Mandarin School was scheduled to open in August 2016. In 2019, principal Chaolin Chang resigned; he stated it was for personal reasons. A group of parents believing HISD forced Chang to resign protested, demanding that HISD reveal the reasons why he resigned and to either re-instate Chang or make another speaker of Mandarin Chinese a principal.  Curriculum  For elementary, the school uses a 50-50 immersion model. Half of the instruction is in Mandarin Chinese, provided by teachers who are native Mandarin speakers. The other half are from other teachers who reinforce the concepts that had been taught in Chinese in the English language. The core subjects, mathematics, language arts, science, and social science, are taught mostly in Mandarin. However, the middle school curriculum provides only a Chinese class and math class in Mandarin. The school dedicates some of its instructional time to the development of English language skills. Each class has two teachers, with one speaking English and the other speaking Mandarin. , the school provides Rosetta Stone software for parents who wish to learn Chinese with their children. = Academic performance = , the Texas Education Agency (TEA) issued an accountability rating of 97, among the highest of any HISD school.  Student body  In the 2017-2018 school year, 38% of the students were Asian, 19% were non-Hispanic white, 18% were Hispanic, 17% were African-American, and 9% were Multiracial. Margaret Downing of the Houston Press characterizes this as \\"a diverse student body.\\" , most of the students who were enrolled had no prior experience learning Mandarin. Some students had not yet mastered English, and/or were learning Mandarin as a third language.  Campus  The new campus is located adjacent to St. George Place Elementary School in St. George Place, Houston. The facility has a price tag of $32 million. The 2012 HISD Bond financed the construction. PBK Architects designed the building. Groundbreaking occurred on December 8, 2014. The campus includes an auditorium with a stage, a gymnasium, a cafeteria, and a technology and design laboratory. The campus uses a sun and moon theme, based on the Chinese character \\"M√≠ng\\" (Êòé), which incorporates the sun and the moon. A three-story area known as a \\"sun wing\\" houses academic areas while community functions are held in the \\"moon wing\\"; the school uses the former to represent energy while the later is meant to represent reflection and subtlety. The school's 3D printing and robotics facilities are located in the laboratory. In order to facilitate the sounds of Mandarin, including its tones, the school installed a special sound system. The school shares athletic fields and green areas with St. George Place Elementary.

When General Ulysses S. Grant launched his overland campaign in the spring of 1864, the 6th participated in a succession of bloody battles. These included the Battle of the Wilderness, the Battle of Spotsylvania, the Battle of Cold Harbor, the Siege at Petersburg, and the Battle of Cedar Creek, which was fought on October 19. At Cedar Creek, located in the Shenandoah Valley, the 6th were surprise attacked by the Confederates. They rallied and were able to repulse the attack thanks to the leadership of General Sheridan. Unfortunately for the 6th, Colonel J. Howard Kitching was wounded and died of his wounds on January 10. They 6th also distinguished themselves at the Battle of Harris Farm. They held their ground for over two hours and repulsed a more experienced enemy. General Gordon Meade commended the regiment \\"for their gallantry conduct in this affair and classing us with the Veterans of the Army of the Potomac.\\" Total strength and casualties The regiment was honorably discharged and mustered out August 24, 1865, near Washington, D. C., having during its service lost by death, killed in action, 1 officer, 62 enlisted men; of wounds received in action, 5 officers, 68 enlisted men; of disease and other causes, 6 officers, 278 enlisted men; total, 12 officers, 408 enlisted men; aggregate, 420; of whom 57 enlisted men died in the hands of the enemy.New York State Military Museum 6th Heavy Artillery Regiment Civil War Anthony Wayne Guard Commanders * Colonel William H.

A DNA hairpin, containing the sequence of interest, is bound between a magnetic bead and a glass surface. A magnetic field is applied to stretch the hairpin open into single strands, and the hairpin refolds after decreasing of the magnetic field. The hairpin length can be determined by direct imaging of the diffraction rings of the magnetic beads using a simple microscope. The DNA sequences are determined by measuring the changes in the hairpin length following successful hybridization of complementary nucleotides.  Single- molecule sequencing vs. Next-generation sequencing  With the development of various next-generation sequencing platforms, there has been a substantial reduction in costs, and increase in throughput of DNA sequencing. However, the majority of the sequencing technologies rely on PCR-based clonal amplification of the DNA molecule in order to bring the signal to a detectable range. Sequencing of amplified clusters, or bulk sequencing in such a propose a read length-dependent phasing problem. During each cycle, not all of the molecules within the bulk have successful incorporation of an additional nucleotide. With increased sequencing cycle, the signal of the lagging molecules will eventually overwhelm the true signal. The phasing problem is a major limitation for the read lengths of the next-generation sequencing technologies. Therefore, there is an increased interest in developing single- molecule sequencing technologies, where no amplification is required. This not only shortens the preparation time for the sequencing libraries, it also has the potential to achieve much longer read lengths, as the lagging molecules with failed extensions can be ignored or considered separately. Previously known single-molecule sequencing technologies include Nanopore sequencing (Oxford Nanopore), SMRT sequencing (Pacific Biosciences), and Heliscope single molecule sequencing (Helicos Biosciences). Magnetic detection of oligonucleotides hybridized to the DNA hairpin DNA hairpin attached to magnetic bead and glass slide Transient blockage in DNA hairpin refolding due to hybridization events = Generation of DNA hairpin = The DNA molecule of interest must be incorporated into a hairpin, and attached to a magnetic bead on one end and to an immobile glass surface on the other end. The hairpin is attached to the glass surface via a digoxigenin-antidigoxigenin bond. The magnetic bead is attached to the opposite end via biotin-streptavidin interaction. Such DNA hairpin setup can be made in two ways: :1) In the case of double-stranded DNA molecules (for whole genome sequencing, or targeted sequencing), the DNA fragment is ligated to a DNA loop at one end and a DNA fork structure, labeled with biotin and digoxigenin at the two ends. :2) For RNA-seq, the mRNA can be trapped on a poly-T-coated bead, where reverse transcription reaction is performed on the bead to generate a cDNA hairpin. = Measurement of hairpin length = Electromagnets are placed above the sample slide, and an inverted microscope is placed below. The image is captured via a CCD camera and transferred to a computer, where the three- dimensional positions of the magnetic beads are determined. The position of the bead within the horizontal plane of the glass slide, x and y, are determined by real-time correlation of the bead images. The vertical length of the hairpin, measured by the vertical position of the attached magnetic bead, is measured by the bead‚Äôs diffraction ring diameter, which increases with distance. = Opening and closing of DNA hairpin = A constant magnetic force is applied to unzip the DNA hairpin, and reducing the force allows the hairpin to rezip. Prior to performing the downstream applications several unzipping and rezipping cycles are performed. While the magnetic force required to unzip and rezip may vary depending on the DNA sequence and hairpin length, their absolute values are not critical as long as they are consistent within a sequencing run. =Detection of hybridization events= When the DNA hairpin is unzipped into single-strand, oligonucleotides complementary to the hairpin sequence are allowed to hybridize. During the time course of the rezipping process, the bound oligonucleotides cause transient blockages. The time course measurement of hairpin length allows for the determination of the exact position of the hybridization, as well as the presence of mismatches between the oligonucleotide and the hairpin. Applications for hairpin length detection in sequencing= Sequencing by hybridization = Steps involved in magnetic sequencing by hybridization Hybridization is one way to determine the sequence of a DNA strand from detecting the changes in the length of a hairpin. When a probe hybridizes to an open hairpin, complete refolding of the hairpin is stalled, and the position of the hybridized probe can be inferred. Thus the sequence of a DNA fragment of interest can be inferred from overlapping the positions of probes sets, which are allowed to hybridize one by one. Generation of 8-nt sequence First, a DNA fragment can be converted into a new sequence in which each original nucleotide is encoded by a specific 8-nt sequence (A8, T8, G8 and C8) and then ligated to a hairpin. Hybridization of A8, T8, C8, G8 oligonucleotides After applying a magnetic force, in the unzipped state of the hairpin, a small number of discriminating nucleotides can hybridize to the new individual complementary sequences on the hairpin which can transiently block the refolding of the hairpin. Map positions Identification of the blockage positions of the hairpin produced by the hybridization of the discriminating nucleotides can be observed as the pauses in the time course of the hairpin distance measurement. The complete sequence can be reconstructed by the overlapping fragments.  Sequencing by ligation  Steps involved in magnetic sequencing by ligation Another application for the magnetic sequencing is using the hairpin end-to- end distance to detect the successive ligation of oligonucleotide. First step of sequencing by ligation is using a primer to extend a DNA fragment. Extension is first attempted with a fragment starting with adenine, which can only be ligated if the next nucleotide on the opposite strand is a thymine. Then fragments starting with cytosine, guanine and thymine are attempted in turn, and the cycle is repeated. The magnetic field is released after each ligation, and then the length of the extended primer is measured. Upon ligation the primer is extended by seven bases, which is resulting in a detectable increase in the hairpin‚Äôs end to end distance. RNase cleavage at position 2 is followed by the ligation for the preparation of the next ligation cycle, so that the next ligation is positioned just ahead of the previous one. =7nt primer library = 7-nt primer library, 5‚Ä≤-NNNNNNrX-3‚Ä≤, are used in the ligation of a short degenerate oligonucleotide fragmentin, in which N represents any of the four deoxyribonucleotides and Nr represents any of the four ribonucleotides, X is the tested base(A,G,C,T). The ligation to a primer strand of each of the four tested bases in hairpin opening and closing cycles are tested. = Ligation = 7-nt primer ligates in the open state of the hairpin, which will block rezipping of the last seven nucleotides and increase the distance between the surface and the magnetic bead by ~5 nm. If the ligation is not successful, no change in the hairpin length is observed. = RNase = RNase cleavage of the last six nucleotides is the next step following the ligation, ultimately extending the primer strand by a single base. Such cleavage allows rezipping of 6 nucleotides of the hairpin, signaled by a decrease in hairpin length of ~4 nm. Therefore, an incorporation of a complementary nucleotide is indicated by an increase in 7 nucleotides (+5 nm) followed by a decrease in 6 nucleotides (-4 nm). = Kinase= After the RNase cleavage of the last six nucleotides, the next step is phosphorylation of the 5'-end via Kinase. Then the next cycle of ligation can be repeated. Advantages of the magnetic method in single- molecule sequencing=Nature of the detected signal= Many of the competitive single-molecule sequencing methods rely on the incorporation of fluorescently labeled nucleotides. In next-generation sequencing, the fluorescence signal of clusters can be easily detected. However, when the same concept is applied to single-molecule sequencing, the largest complication results from the high error rates. Because it is difficult to detect single labeled molecules, these platforms suffer from low signal-to-noise ratios, often resulting in misdetection or non-detection of fluorescent signals. In the case of magnetic sequencing, the signal measured is the changes in distance between two ends of a hairpin. Such signal can be readily detected with standard cameras. Thus, the signals are easier to detect, even without the use of expensive imaging devices. =Relaxation of the experimental constraints for single-nucleotide discrimination= In addition to the nature of the detected signal, other implementations in this platform allows for an even higher signal-to-noise ratio. In the case of magnetic sequencing by hybridization, a set of overlapping tiles is used such that the sequence of each nucleotide is determined by the hybridization of an 8-mer. Therefore, the instrument only requires the sensitivity to detect a change of ~ 6 nm (the length of 8 nucleotides). Similarly, for sequencing by ligation cycles, successful incorporation is characterized by a ~5 nm increase (ligation of a 7-mer) followed by a ~ 4 nm decrease (RNase cleavage of 6-mer) in hairpin length. In this case, the decrease in length in the second step provides additional confirmation for the obtained signal. Technical considerations=Resolution= With the current methods, the instrumental error in the measured hairpin length is 1-1.5 nm. The length of a basepair, or 2 extended single-stranded nucleotides, is approximately 0.85 nm. Therefore, the resolution of the system is at a few nucleotides. The sources of noise arise from length-dependent Brownian motion of the bead anchored by the extended hairpin, statistical error in bead position determination, and slow mechanical drifts. However, as mentioned earlier, such resolution is sufficient for the current sequencing method because changes in >4 nm are being measured. =Throughput= Through the use of magnetic traps, constant magnetic force can be applied to millions of DNA hairpin-tethered magnetic beads in parallel. The magnetic force can be easily adjusted by changing the distance between the trap and the magnetic beads. The number of eads that can be simultaneously monitored, which determines the read throughput of this platform, is limited by the bead size, length of the tethered DNA hairpin, and the optical resolution limit. Currently, a density of 750 K/mm2 (comparable to an Illumina HiSeq 2000)Illumina HiSeq 2000 Specifications can be achieved. =Read length= As mentioned above, the noise due to the Brownian fluctuations of the bead increases with length. Robust sequencing tests have yet to be performed to determine the maximum read length of this system. However, the ligation of a 7-mer in the middle of a 1241 nucleotide-long hairpin was successfully detected, suggesting that the current system is sufficient to sequence up to ~500 bp. =Additional limitations= The rate of sequencing or imaging is dependent on the mechanical movement speed of the magnetic beads, which is limited by drag force. Currently, it is possible to measure 10 hairpin open-close cycle per second. Additional complications include the existence of a secondary hairpin structure in the DNA of interest. In such a case the DNA loop to be ligated must be designed such that it its closing is favored over the closing of the endogenous loop in the DNA of interest.

It was one of the many race riots in 1919 in the United States during what became known as Red Summer, a period after World War I known for numerous riots occurring mostly in urban areas. The riot ended after local and state officials took actions to impose military authority and quell further violence. After ignoring early rumors of planned unrest, local officials appealed to the governor for forces to quell the violence. In a short time, the Texas National Guard and Texas Rangers sent forces to the town, where the Guard organized an occupation and curfew. Some men were shot and numerous black homes and businesses were burned prior to the arrival of the law enforcement and military units. One black man was shot and killed by armed whites before the National Guard occupied the town. No one was prosecuted for the events, although numerous whites and blacks were arrested. The black suspects were taken to Austin for their safety; half were advised against ever returning to Longview. Background Longview is located approximately 125 miles east of Dallas in northeast Texas. In 1919 it had a population of 5,700, of which 1,790, or thirty-one percent, were African American. It was an area of historic cotton cultivation, which had depended on slave labor before the American Civil War. Lumbering of pinelands was another major part of the rural economy. Longview is the seat of Gregg County. In 1919 the county had a population of 16,700, of which 8,160, or forty-eight percent, was black. The area was still very rural; according to historian Kenneth E. Durham, Jr., cotton was a major commodity crop. Thousands of blacks had already left the South in the Great Migration, settling in Northeastern and Midwestern cities. They had sometimes been hired as strikebreakers and competed with working-class whites for jobs. That summer riots took place in many cities across the country, where ethnic whites clashed with blacks in postwar social tensions brought on by fierce competition for jobs and housing. In Longview, racial tensions had deep roots. Most blacks in Texas and the South were disenfranchised at the turn of the century, based on new constitutions and laws passed by Democratic-dominated legislatures. Excluded from the political system, they were oppressed under Jim Crow rules and white supremacy. Another reflection of postwar violence was a rise in the number of lynchings: in 1919, 78 blacks had been lynched in Texas, a substantial increase over the numbers during World War I: an increase of 15 lynchings over the total in 1918, and 30 more deaths than the lynchings of 1917. Causes Following service by many blacks in the military in the Great War, African Americans aspired to better treatment in the United States. East Texas blacks were in touch with national movements and media, as represented by the weekly delivery by train of the influential The Chicago Defender, a weekly newspaper with nationwide coverage and circulation. The local reporter and newspaper distributor was Samuel L. Jones, a schoolteacher. At the time, Jones and Dr. Calvin P. Davis, a 34-year-old black physician, were prominent leaders in Longview's African-American community. Not long before the riot, the two were known to be encouraging local black farmers to avoid white cotton brokers and sell directly to buyers in Galveston in order to keep more of their profits. At the same time, members of the Negro Business League had set up a cooperative store that competed with white merchants. In June, local man Lemuel Walters of Longview had been whipped by two white men from Kilgore, allegedly for making \\"indecent advances\\" toward their sister. (One account said he was found in her bedroom.) Under Jim Crow, white men strictly monitored and discouraged relations between black men and white women, but not the reverse. Walters was arrested and put in jail in Longview. A lynch mob of ten men abducted him on June 17 and killed him that night by gunshots, leaving him near the railroad tracks. Dr. Davis, Jones, and some other respectable black men went to Judge Bramlette in town, asking him to investigate the lynching. He asked for the names of people Jones had talked to at the jail. When no investigation was undertaken, the men returned to Judge Bramlette but became convinced he did not intend to pursue the case. On July 5, 1919, The Chicago Defender published an article about Walters' death. It said that \\"Walters' only crime was that he was loved by a white woman,\\" and it quoted her (unnamed) as saying that she \\"would have married him if they had lived in the North.\\" The article described her as \\"so distraught over his [Walters] death that she required a physician's care.\\" It said that the sheriff guarding Walters had let the lynch mob take him, without offering resistance. While the article did not identify the woman, in those small towns many readers knew who she was. Some were offended at the suggestion that she had loved Walters, saying it was damaging to the young woman's reputation. Riot=Beating of Samuel L. Jones= As Samuel L. Jones was known to be a local correspondent for the Defender, whites believed he wrote the article. He denied having written it. The young woman's brothers attacked Jones on Thursday, July 10, 1919, giving him a severe beating across from the courthouse. Dr. Calvin P. Davis arrived in his car soon after and took Jones to his office to treat him. Meanwhile, \\"tension and anger\\" spread across town as whites learned of the article, and as blacks gathered at Melvin Street learned about the beating. After being warned that Jones was at risk for trouble that night, Davis appealed to the mayor for protection. Bodenheim sent a messenger to Jones at supper time, advising him and Davis to leave town that night. Davis later learned that Mayor Bodenheim and other officials were holding a meeting on the situation. He appeared there, appealing for protection and repeating that neither had written the article. They advised him to leave town but he and Jones did not want to run. The mayor and Judge Bramlette, and a local attorney, Ras Young, had talked to local whites and urged them to leave Jones alone. But \\"gangs\\" of both whites and blacks roamed the streets that night, ready for the next events. At about midnight on July 10, a group of between twelve and fifteen white men gathered at Bodie Park, located at the corner of Tyler and Fredonia streets. They went to Jones' house by car, reaching his place at Harrison and College streets south of the railroad tracks about 1:00 AM, July 11, 1919. Davis and Jones had gathered about 25 friends to defend the house; Davis warned them against shooting before he gave the word. When the whites approached the house, Jones and his friends opened fire on them with small arms. Some of the whites were also armed, and they returned fire as they retreated to cover. In all, over 100 rounds were expended during the skirmish. Three of the whites were slightly wounded by birdshot. A fourth who hid under a nearby house was captured by the blacks and beaten badly. The remaining whites fled back to the center of Longview. Most went to the fire station next to Bodie Park, where a crowd gradually grew. Some of the large crowd broke into the Welch Hardware Store to take more guns and ammunition. At this point, the mob feared that their companion who had been captured was dead, so they raised the alarm for reinforcements. Davis reported that the fire bell was ringing and nearly 1,000 whites gathered near it. (Other accounts say the group numbered 100.) Near daybreak, about 4:00 AM, the mob returned to Jones' house. Finding it empty, they set it on fire. They also burned a neighboring house. From there, the mob moved south to the Quick Hall, an African-American dance hall owned by Charlie Medlock; they set it on fire, as there were rumors it held stored ammunition. A cache of ammunition began exploding \\"throughout the building.\\" The mob next went to Dr. Davis' deserted house, located at the southeast corner of the Harrison and Nelson streets and burned it, too. They first allowed his wife and children to get out without harm. They burned a car on the street, and burned down his office. Going east on Nelson Street, the mob reached the homes of Ben Sanders and Charlie Medlock. They set both on fire, attacking Medlock and Belle Sanders, Ben's wife, when they protested. With sunrise, the mob dispersed. Sheriff D.S. Meredith and Judge Bramlette called Governor William P. Hobby to ask for military support. Hobby responded by placing the National Guard units in Dallas, Terrell, and Nacogdoches, on high alert, but he sent only eight Texas Rangers to Longview. They were not due to arrive before Saturday morning, July 12, and Longview authorities expected more trouble on Friday. They called Governor Hobby again, who sent some dismounted National Guard soldiers to Longview. The soldiers were members of the 5th, 6th, and 7th Texas Cavalry Regiments, and numbered about 100 men altogether. They erected a large tent on the eastern side of the courthouse square to be used as a command post. As part of this force, The Washington Times reported that planes were used to stop the riots. =Murder of Marion Bush= Marion Bush was a 60-year-old black man who had worked with the local Kelly Plow Company for thirty years. He was father-in-law of Calvin P. Davis, the physician. On the night of July 12, Sheriff Meredith and Ike Killingsworth went to Bush's house, located on the west side of Court Street, one block south of the Texas and Pacific Railroad tracks. The sheriff is thought to have been either offering Bush protective custody (as his son, then 13, said in an interview decades later in 1978) or intending to arrest him. Apparently alarmed, Bush fled from the house, after reportedly firing shots at the sheriff. There are differing accounts as to what happened next. From interviews in 1978 and a contemporary Dallas newspaper, Durham says the sheriff called farmer Jim Stephens and asked him to stop Bush. He found him and ordered him to stop, but Bush ran into a cornfield. Stephens followed, shooting and killing him. According to the same Dallas Morning News of July 13 and 14, \\"armed white citizens\\" hunted down Bush, killing the 60-year-old man in a cornfield south of town. Reinforcements and martial law Contemperory News coverage showing the views of the press in 1919 When local officials heard of Bush's killing, they feared a new wave of civil unrest. They called Governor Hobby again for aid, and he sent about 160 more soldiers and Texas Rangers. On Sunday, July 13, Hobby declared martial law in all of Gregg County, placing Brigadier General Robert H. McDill in command of the soldiers and the rangers. On July 13, General McDill issued orders, dividing the town into two districts, giving command of one section to Colonel T.E. Barton, and the other to Colonel H.W. Peck. Colonel H.C. Smith was placed in command of the Texas Rangers. McDill ordered a 10:30 PM to 6:00 AM curfew in Longview, and prohibited groups of three or more people from gathering on the streets. He ordered the local telephone operators not to place any long-distance calls, to prevent recruiting of weapons or men from neighboring towns. He ordered all residents of Longview and Kilgore to surrender their weapons at the county courthouse in Longview. Residents were warned that their homes could be searched, with a severe penalty for concealing firearms. An estimated 5,000 to 7,000 guns were turned in at the courthouse, and stored in \\"scattered locations throughout the building.\\" General McDill asked the town officials to organize a committee consisting of local citizens, to work with him and the military during the emergency. They identified only white businessmen and other leaders. The committee met on Monday, July 14, at Judge Bramlette's office and elected the attorney Ras Young as chairman; it also authorized Judge Bramlette, Sheriff Bodenheim and Young to communicate with the military. The committee drafted a list of concerns. They \\"expressed disapproval\\" of Jones' newspaper article and the armed defense of his former home. Their resolution said, we will not \\"permit the negroes of this community and county to in any way interfere with our social affairs or to write or circulate articles about the white people of our city or county....\\" The committee stated their opposition to the burning of African-American property, and took steps to prevent any more losses. The members commended Governor Hobby for quickly sending the National Guard and the Texas Rangers. Investigation and arrests The Rangers learned the identity of the \\"ringleader\\" of the riot, who gave them names of sixteen other men involved in the first attack on Jones' house. All were arrested for attempted murder on July 14, but quickly released on $1,000 bonds ($ in ). The Rangers learned the name of nine other suspects, arresting them for arson; they were also released on $1,000 bonds. Captain Hanson also questioned black residents, ultimately arresting twenty- one black men for assault and attempted murder. He temporarily placed them in the county jail, removing them to Austin for safety. Neither Jones nor Davis were arrested, as they had secretly left town. Davis dressed as a soldier and went out by train. General McDill organized an assembly at the courthouse and informed the public of the arrests, the presence of National Guard troops and Texas Rangers, and expectations. Brigadier General Jake F. Wolters also spoke to the citizens. According to Durham, the assembly had a \\"sobering effect\\" on the crowd. No other violent acts were reported; a couple of fires occurred but were not believed to be due to arson. Eventually, McDill asked the citizens' committee when they thought martial law should be ended. They said he should wait until all of the blacks who had been arrested were sent out of the county, because there were rumors that certain whites would kill some of these men as soon as they reclaimed their guns. The twenty-one blacks were taken to Austin by the Texas National Guard. Travis County officials wanted to have the prisoners incarcerated at the Texas State Penitentiary, at state expense, but that would have been illegal. The prisoners were separated into smaller groups and placed in various county jails, at Gregg County's expense, until they could be tried in a Gregg County court. The blacks who had helped Davis defend Jones at home were told not to return to Longview, but others returned to relative peace. The governor lifted martial law at noon on Friday, July 18. Residents were allowed to begin picking up their guns on the next day. Town officials tried to promote \\"harmonious relations\\" between the races. None of the blacks nor the whites was ever tried. Durham suggests that Gregg County officials chose to avoid trials in order to defuse the tension, perhaps believing that at trial by the all-white juries of this time period, that the whites were likely to be acquitted and the blacks convicted. No documentation relates to the decisions about not pursuing prosecution. Aftermath Dr. Davis and Samuel Jones both reached Chicago after fleeing Longview and eventually settled there with their families. On August 18, 1919, they had a meeting and extended interview with John R. Shillady, the white executive secretary of the national office of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and Charles E. Bentley, a black dentist who served as secretary of the Chicago chapter, to report on the events in Longview. A summary of their account was published in the NAACP's newspaper, The Crisis, in October. By that date, racial conflicts had erupted in numerous large and small cities across the country, including Chicago, which had a week of violence ending in early August that resulted in a total of 38 deaths and more than 500 people injured, as well as extensive property damage. Violence of whites against blacks continued into the fall, with a riot in Omaha, Nebraska, in late September; blacks continued to defend themselves.

The authorization for a major construction program for light cruisers came in the 1898 Naval Law, which ordered the acquisition of thirty vessels of the type.Herwig, p. 42 The first such class of light cruiser, the , was based on several intermediate designs of unprotected cruisers, such as the , and avisos‚Äîdispatch boats‚Äîlike .Gardiner & Gray, p. 143 The ten members of the Gazelle class set the basic parameters for all later light cruisers of the Kaiserliche Marine.Herwig, p. 28 Over the following two decades, the Germans built a further thirty-seven light cruisers; these vessels slowly grew in size, speed, armament, and armor. The original SK L/40 gun was replaced by the more advanced L/45 model in the , and it was in turn superseded by the more powerful SK L/45 gun in the . A waterline armored belt was introduced in the , which significantly improved the ships' defensive qualities. These forty-seven cruisers all saw action across the globe in World War I; the bulk served with the German fleets in the North and Baltic Seas, though several served on foreign stations, typically as commerce raiders. Sixteen cruisers were lost during the war to causes ranging from enemy submarines and naval mines to combat with hostile cruiser squadrons. Most of the survivors were either scuttled in Scapa Flow in June 1919 or seized by the various Allied governments as war prizes following Germany's defeat. Several of these were commissioned into their fleets: Italy received three cruisers and France took four. Germany was permitted to retain eight of the oldest cruisers; of these, five continued to serve in secondary roles into World War II. The Treaty of Versailles allowed Germany to replace these old cruisers, and the first such new vessel, Emden, was built in the early 1920s to a design based on the last wartime classes. A new approach was taken in the five members of the succeeding and es with triple gun turrets and hybrid diesel/turbine propulsion systems. A further six ships of the were planned in the late 1930s, but the outbreak of war forced their cancellation. The six cruisers of the Emden, K√∂nigsberg, and Leipzig classes all served in World War II, and only one‚ÄîN√ºrnberg‚Äîsurvived the war intact. Two were sunk during the invasion of Norway and the remaining three vessels were destroyed by Allied bombers in the final months of the war. N√ºrnberg, the last cruiser completed by Germany, was seized by the Soviet Union and commissioned as Admiral Makarov, serving until the late 1950s. { style=\\"float: right; margin: 0 0 0 1em;\\" |+ Key |-  Armament The number and type of the primary armament |-  Armor The thickness of the deck armor |-  Displacement Ship displacement at full combat load |-  Propulsion Number of shafts, type of propulsion system, and top speed generated |-  Service The dates work began and finished on the ship and its ultimate fate |-  Laid down The date the keel began to be assembled |-  Commissioned The date the ship was commissioned |} __TOC__ Kaiserliche Marine=Gazelle class= Frauenlob underway before the outbreak of World War I The Gazelle class was the first modern light cruiser design of the Imperial Navy.Gardiner, p. 258 This new class of ships was the culmination of earlier unprotected cruisers‚Äîthe ‚Äîand several experimental intermediate types, such as and . The Germans intended to use the Gazelles both as fleet scouts and overseas cruisers. Though they were smaller than their foreign contemporaries, they were strongly built and powerfully armed ships for the period.Gardiner, p. 249 As a result, they could effectively perform the two roles envisioned for the design. According to the historian Eric Osborne, \\"[t]he light cruisers of the Gazelle-class established a trend for future ships of this general design ... [they] carried little or no armor, the chief asset being speed.\\"Osborne, 55 Indeed, all future light cruisers built by the Imperial Navy generally followed the same pattern, with few fundamental changes. The ten ships served in a variety of roles throughout their career. Before the war, most served on foreign stations or with the main fleet, while and served as training ships.Gr√∂ner, pp. 101‚Äì102 Due to their age, the Gazelles had been placed in reserve by 1914, but after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, they were mobilized for active service. Most were initially used as coastal defense vessels in the Baltic, but Frauenlob and Ariadne remained in service with the fleet. Ariadne was sunk by several British battlecruisers at the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914.Staff, Battle on the Seven Seas pp. 21‚Äì24 Frauenlob was torpedoed and sunk by at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916 with the loss of almost her entire crew.Campbell, pp. 392‚Äì393 In the Baltic, Undine was torpedoed and sunk by the British submarine on 7 November 1915.Polmar & Noot, p. 45 The seven surviving ships were withdrawn from front- line service in 1916 and used for auxiliary purposes. They went on to serve in the new Reichsmarine, with the exception of Gazelle, which was broken up for scrap in 1920. Niobe was sold to Yugoslavia in 1925 and renamed Dalmacija, while Nymphe and Thetis were scrapped in the early 1930s. Arcona, Medusa, and Amazone were used as barracks hulks for the rest of the 1930s. After the outbreak of World War II, Medusa and Arcona were converted into floating anti- aircraft batteries and defended German ports from 1940 to the end of the war, when they were scuttled by their crews on 3 May 1945. Amazone meanwhile remained in service as a barracks ship through the end of the war. Dalmacija eventually returned to German control in 1943, and she was destroyed in December of that year by British Motor Torpedo Boats.Rohwer, p. 294 { style=\\"text-align: center;\\" |+ Summary of the Gazelle class |- valign=\\"top\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" Ship  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armament  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armor  rowspan=\\"2\\" Displacement  rowspan=\\"2\\" Propulsion  colspan=\\"3\\" Service |- valign=\\"top\\"  Laid down  Commissioned  Fate |- valign=\\"center\\"  rowspan=\\"10\\" 10 √ó 10.5 cm SK L/40 gunsGr√∂ner, pp. 99‚Äì102 rowspan=\\"10\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" 2 shafts, 2 reciprocating engines, 1897 15 June 1901 Scrapped, 1920 |- valign=\\"center\\"  rowspan=\\"9\\" 2 shafts, 2 reciprocating engines, rowspan=\\"2\\" 1898 25 June 1900 Destroyed, 19 December 1943 |- valign=\\"center\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" 20 September 1900 Scrapped, 1932 |- valign=\\"center\\"  rowspan=\\"3\\" 1899 14 September 1901 Scrapped, 1930 |- valign=\\"center\\"  18 May 1901 Sunk Battle of Heligoland Bight, 28 August 1914 |- valign=\\"center\\"  18 May 1901 Scrapped, 1954 |- valign=\\"center\\"  1900 26 July 1901 Scrapped, 1948‚Äì1950 |- valign=\\"center\\"  rowspan=\\"3\\" 1901 17 February 1903 Sunk, Battle of Jutland, 31 May 1916 |- valign=\\"center\\"  12 May 1903 Scrapped, 1948 |- valign=\\"center\\"  5 January 1904 Sunk, 7 November 1915 |} =Bremen class= Bremen in the United States in 1907 The Bremen class was an incremental improvement over the earlier Gazelles, being larger and slightly faster. They were otherwise very similar, and mounted the same main battery of 10.5 cm guns.Gardiner, pp. 258‚Äì259 One ship, , was fitted with new Parsons steam turbines to evaluate their use in future designs; the other vessels retained proven triple-expansion engines.Gardiner, p. 259 The ships' peacetime careers saw them serving in several capacities. and served in the East Asia Squadron early in their careers; the other ships, save , were assigned to the fleet scouting forces. M√ºnchen was used as a torpedo training ship.Gr√∂ner, pp. 103‚Äì104 The ships saw extensive action during the war.

Only Berlin and were retained after the war; the other surviving ships were seized by Britain as war prizes and scrapped in the early 1920s. Both were used as training cruisers in the 1920s and then as barracks ships from the 1930s. Hamburg was sunk by British bombers in 1944 during World War II,Rohwer, p. 264 and Berlin was loaded with chemical weapons and scuttled in the Skaggerak in 1947 to dispose of the munitions. { style=\\"text-align: center;\\" |+ Summary of the Bremen class |- valign=\\"top\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" Ship  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armament  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armor  rowspan=\\"2\\" Displacement  rowspan=\\"2\\" Propulsion  colspan=\\"3\\" Service |- valign=\\"top\\"  Laid down  Commissioned  Fate |- valign=\\"center\\"  rowspan=\\"7\\" 10 √ó 10.5 cm SK L/40 gunsGr√∂ner, p. 103 rowspan=\\"7\\" Gr√∂ner, p. 102 rowspan=\\"3\\" 2 shafts, 2 reciprocating engines, Gr√∂ner, pp. 102‚Äì103 rowspan=\\"3\\" 1902 19 May 1904 Sunk, 17 February 1915 |- valign=\\"center\\"  8 March 1904 Scrapped, 1956 |- valign=\\"center\\"  4 April 1905 Scuttled, 1947 |- valign=\\"center\\"  4 shafts, 2 steam turbines, rowspan=\\"2\\" 1903 26 April 1906 Scrapped, 1922‚Äì1923 |- valign=\\"center\\"  rowspan=\\"3\\" 2 shafts, 2 reciprocating engines, 22 kn 10 January 1905 Scrapped, 1920 |- valign=\\"center\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" 1904 20 April 1906 Sunk, Battle of the Falkland Islands, 8 December 1914 |- valign=\\"center\\"  1 December 1907 Scrapped, 1922‚Äì1923 |} =K√∂nigsberg class (1905)= K√∂nigsberg in German East Africa The K√∂nigsberg class continued the general trend of slightly larger and faster German light cruiser designs. Like the Bremens, one member of the new class‚Äî‚Äîwas equipped with turbines for testing purposes. They retained the same armament and armor protection of the Bremen class. All four ships were employed with the High Seas Fleet after they were commissioned, though was deployed to Asia in 1910,Gray, p. 184 and was sent to East African waters in 1914.Farwell, p. 128 All four ships saw major action during the war. K√∂nigsberg, based in Dar es Salaam at the outbreak of war, began a short and unsuccessful commerce raiding career in the region,Halpern, p. 77 though she did destroy the British cruiser .Farwell, p. 133 She eventually became trapped in the Rufiji River and was later destroyed by a pair of British monitors in 1915.Bennett, pp. 132‚Äì134 The war was not over for the vessel, however, as her guns were removed and used extensively in Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck's East African Campaign.Herwig, pp. 154‚Äì155 N√ºrnberg participated in the battles at Coronel and the Falkland Islands, where she was sunk.Bennett, p. 125 Stettin saw action at the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914.Staff, Battle on the Seven Seas, pp. 7‚Äì11 Both she and also participated in the Battle of Jutland. Stettin was used as a training ship after 1917, and Stuttgart was converted into a seaplane tender in 1918.

Like the preceding classes, one ship was equipped with turbine engines, and one with reciprocating machinery; this was to be the last time a German cruiser utilized the older triple-expansion engines. All subsequent designs adopted steam turbines universally.Gardiner & Gray, pp. 157‚Äì163 Dresden and Emden had very active and short careers. Both vessels served on foreign stations for the majority of their careers; Emden was assigned to the East Asia Squadron after she entered service,Forstmeier, pp. 2‚Äì4 and Dresden spent much time off the North American Atlantic coast.Delgado, pp. 169‚Äì170 Dresden initially operated as a commerce raider in the Atlantic after the outbreak of war in 1914, before steaming around South America to join von Spee's squadron as it approached the continent.Halpern, pp. 79‚Äì80 She took part in the battles of Coronel and the Falkland Islands,Staff, Battle on the Seven Seas, pp. 34‚Äì35 and she was the only German cruiser to escape destruction at the latter.Staff, Battle on the Seven Seas, p. 73 She was later trapped by British cruisers at M√°s a Tierra in March 1915.Mueller, pp. 16‚Äì17 After a short bombardment from the British ships, Dresdens crew scuttled her in the harbor.Delgado, pp. 168‚Äì169 Emden, meanwhile, had been detached from the East Asia Squadron to act as an independent raider in the Indian Ocean. She had a successful career hunting Allied merchant ships in the area, and also sank the Russian protected cruiser Zhemchug in Penang harbor.Forstmeier, pp. 10‚Äì14 Shortly thereafter, the Australian light cruiser caught Emden off the Cocos Islands and inflicted serious damage, forcing her to beach on the island of North Keeling.Forstmeier, pp. 16‚Äì19 { style=\\"text-align: center;\\" |+ Summary of the Dresden class |- valign=\\"top\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" Ship  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armament  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armor  rowspan=\\"2\\" Displacement  rowspan=\\"2\\" Propulsion  colspan=\\"3\\" Service |- valign=\\"top\\"  Laid down  Commissioned  Fate |- valign=\\"center\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" 10 √ó 10.5 cm SK L/40 gunsGr√∂ner, p. 105 rowspan=\\"2\\" 80 mm rowspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"1\\" 2 shafts, 2 steam turbines, 24 kn 1906 14 November 1908 Scuttled, 14 March 1915 |- valign=\\"center\\"  2 shafts, 2 reciprocating engines, 1906Forstmeier, p. 2 20 July 1909 Grounded, Battle of Cocos, 9 November 1914 |} =Kolberg class= Illustration of Mainz by Oscar Parkes, 1910 The Kolberg class represented the first major improvement in combat power for German light cruisers, both qualitatively and quantitatively. They were armed with the longer-barrel 10.5 cm SK L/45 gun, which had a higher muzzle velocity and thus greater range than the earlier L/40 weapon.Gardiner & Gray, p. 140 In addition, they carried an extra pair of guns, which strengthened their broadside. This was on a displacement of over a thousand tons greater than the preceding Dresden class. All four ships were also powered by turbines, which granted them a significant increase in speed over the earlier vessels.Gardiner & Gray, pp. 157‚Äì159 All four ships saw major action during the war. Augsburg fired the first shots of the war against Russia on 2 August.Halpern, p. 184 Mainz and C√∂ln were sunk at the Battle of Heligoland Bight in the first month of the war.Staff, Battle on the Seven Seas, pp. 19, 21 Kolberg saw action at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915 and scored the first hits of the engagement.Halpern, p. 45 Both Kolberg and Augsburg participated in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915,Halpern, pp. 197‚Äì198 and Operation Albion in October 1917.Staff, Battle for the Baltic Islands, p. 60 After the end of the war, Kolberg was seized by France as a war prize and commissioned into the French Navy as Colmar; she served for only a few years and was scrapped in 1929.

Perhaps most importantly, a waterline armored belt was added to improve the defensive capabilities of the new ships. They also had much more powerful turbines, and as a result, a higher top speed. All following light cruisers adopted these innovations. Magdeburgs career was cut short on 26 August 1914, when she ran aground while operating against Russian forces in the Baltic. The Russians seized code books from the wreck and gave copies to the British; this was to have a major effect on the outcome of the naval war in the North Sea.Herwig, p. 150 Breslau was assigned to the Mediterranean Division along with the battlecruiser ;Halpern, p. 15 at the outbreak of war, they steamed to Constantinople where they were sold to the Ottoman Navy. They were instrumental in bringing the Ottoman Empire into the war on the side of Germany.Halpern, pp. 51‚Äì58 Breslau, renamed Midilli, was eventually sunk by British mines during the Battle of Imbros in January 1918.Hownam-Meek, et al., p. 95 The other two ships, Strassburg and Stralsund, remained with the High Seas Fleet for the duration of their careers. They saw action at the major engagements, including Heligoland Bight and Dogger Bank, though neither ship was present at Jutland.Bennett, pp. 145‚Äì150Campbell, p. 23 Both ships survived the war; Strassburg was surrendered to Italy and renamed Taranto. She served through World War II and was sunk by Allied bombers in 1944.Gardiner & Gray, p. 264 Stralsund became the French Mulhouse, though she served for only a few years and was withdrawn from service by 1925 and scrapped a decade later. { style=\\"text-align: center;\\" |+ Summary of the Magdeburg class |- valign=\\"top\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" Ship  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armament  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armor  rowspan=\\"2\\" Displacement  rowspan=\\"2\\" Propulsion  colspan=\\"3\\" Service |- valign=\\"top\\"  Laid down  Commissioned  Fate |- valign=\\"center\\"  rowspan=\\"4\\" 12 √ó 10.5 cm SK L/45 gunsGr√∂ner, p. 107 rowspan=\\"4\\" 3 shafts, 3 steam turbines, Gr√∂ner, pp. 107‚Äì108 1910 20 August 1912 Grounded, 26 August 1914 |- valign=\\"center\\"  4 shafts, 2 steam turbines, 27.5 kn 1910 10 May 1912 Sunk, Battle of Imbros, 20 January 1918 |- valign=\\"center\\"  2 shafts, 2 steam turbines, 27.5 kn 1910 9 October 1912 Sunk, 23 September 1944 |- valign=\\"center\\"  3 shafts, 3 steam turbines, 27.5 kn 1910 10 December 1912 Scrapped, 1935 |} =Karlsruhe class= Karlsruhe underway These two ships were a minor improvement over the Magdeburg class. They were significantly larger, slightly faster, and had a more raked hull, but carried the same main battery and had identical armor protection.Gr√∂ner, pp. 107‚Äì109 They were also the last cruisers to enter service before the outbreak of World War I.Gardiner & Gray, pp. 160‚Äì161 Karlsruhe was assigned to replace Dresden in the Caribbean in mid-1914, and shortly after her arrival in late July 1914, hostilities opened in Europe. Karlsruhe thereafter operated as a commerce raider; she captured or sank some sixteen ships off the coast of Brazil before an accidental explosion destroyed the ship and killed most of her crew.Halpern, p. 79Bennett, p. 131 Rostock, meanwhile, remained with the High Seas Fleet. She saw action at Dogger Bank,Tarrant, pp. 38‚Äì42 the bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft in April 1916,Tarrant, pp. 53‚Äì54 and at Jutland the following month.Tarrant, p. 287 There, she assisted in the destruction of a pair of British destroyers.Tarrant, p. 114 In the ferocious night fighting on the night of 31 May ‚Äì 1 June, Rostock was torpedoed and disabled by British destroyers.Campbell, p. 291 The following morning, she was scuttled to avoid capture when the British cruiser arrived on the scene.Campbell, pp. 295, 316 { style=\\"text- align: center;\\" |+ Summary of the Karlsruhe class |- valign=\\"top\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" Ship  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armament  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armor  rowspan=\\"2\\" Displacement  rowspan=\\"2\\" Propulsion  colspan=\\"3\\" Service |- valign=\\"top\\"  Laid down  Commissioned  Fate |- valign=\\"center\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" 12 √ó 10.5 cm SK L/45 gunsGr√∂ner, p. 109 rowspan=\\"2\\" 60 mm rowspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" 2 shafts, 2 steam turbines, 21 September 1911Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz, pp. 83‚Äì85 15 January 1914 Sunk, 4 November 1914 |- valign=\\"center\\"  1911 5 February 1914 Sunk, Battle of Jutland, 1 June 1916 |} =Graudenz class= Illustration of Regensburg showing the arrangement of the armament and armor The Graudenz-class cruisers were very similar to the preceding Karlsruhe class, being of similar size, mounting an identical main battery, and having a comparable speed. They could be visually differentiated by the number of funnels; Graudenz and Regensburg returned to the three-funnel arrangement of the earlier light cruisers. Both ships served in the reconnaissance forces of the High Seas Fleet. Graudenz was present during the raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in December 1914 and the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915. She was damaged by a mine in mid-1916, and was in dock for repairs during Jutland. Regensburg was present for the battle, where she led the torpedo boat flotillas screening the I Scouting Group battlecruisers.Tarrant, p. 62 She emerged from the battle completely undamaged,Tarrant, pp. 292 despite having led several torpedo attacks against British formations.Tarrant, pp. 130‚Äì131, 186‚Äì187 Both ships survived the war. Graudenz became the Italian Ancona and served until 1937, when she was sold for scrapping. Regensburg was surrendered to France and commissioned as Strasbourg; she served in the French fleet until 1936, when she was reduced to a barracks ship. She served in this capacity through the German occupation of the country, and was eventually scuttled to protect the U-boat pens in Lorient in 1944. { style=\\"text-align: center;\\" |+ Summary of the Graudenz class |- valign=\\"top\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" Ship  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armament  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armor  rowspan=\\"2\\" Displacement  rowspan=\\"2\\" Propulsion  colspan=\\"3\\" Service |- valign=\\"top\\"  Laid down  Commissioned  Fate |- valign=\\"center\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" 12 √ó 10.5 cm SK L/45 gunsGr√∂ner, pp. 109‚Äì110 rowspan=\\"2\\" 60 mm rowspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" 2 shafts, 2 steam turbines, 27.5 kn 1912 10 August 1914 Scrapped, 1937 |- valign=\\"center\\"  1912 3 January 1915 Scuttled, 1944 |} =Pillau class= Pillau, c. 1914‚Äì1916 The two Pillau-class ships were originally ordered by the Russian Navy under the names Maraviev Amurskyy and Admiral Nevelskoy; they were approaching completion when war broke out in August 1914. The German navy therefore seized the ships and completed them as Pillau and Elbing. They were the first completed German light cruisers armed with guns, which marked a significant increase in their combat power. But since they were built originally for the Russians, they lacked the belt armor that had become standard in German cruiser designs.Gardiner & Gray, p. 161 Pillau took part in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga,Halpern, p. 197 and both ships were heavily engaged at Jutland. Elbing was accidentally rammed and disabled by the battleship in the confused night fighting,Tarrant, p. 220 and her crew was ultimately forced to abandon the wreck.Campbell, p. 295 Pillau survived the war and was ceded to Italy; she was commissioned as Bari and served into World War II until she was sunk by American bombers in 1943.Gardiner & Gray, p. 265 { style=\\"text-align: center;\\" |+ Summary of the Pillau class |- valign=\\"top\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" Ship  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armament  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armor  rowspan=\\"2\\" Displacement  rowspan=\\"2\\" Propulsion  colspan=\\"3\\" Service |- valign=\\"top\\"  Laid down  Commissioned  Fate |- valign=\\"center\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" 8 √ó SK L/45 gunsGr√∂ner, pp. 110‚Äì111 rowspan=\\"2\\" 80 mm rowspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" 2 shafts, 2 steam turbines, 27.5 kn rowspan=\\"2\\" 1913 14 December 1914Gr√∂ner, p. 111 Ceded to Italy, 20 July 1920 |- valign=\\"center\\"  4 September 1915 Scuttled, 1 June 1916 |} =Wiesbaden class= Frankfurt as a target ship in US Navy service The Wiesbaden class was the first German light cruiser design to mount 15 cm guns, though the Pillau class was completed with guns of this caliber first.Gardiner & Gray, p. 162 The Wiesbaden-class ships were otherwise very similar to the preceding Graudenz class; they were slightly larger, but had the same speed and identical armor protection.Gardiner & Gray, pp. 161‚Äì162 Wiesbaden only participated in one major battle: Jutland. Early in the engagement, the ship was badly damaged by gunfire from the battlecruiser . Immobilized between the two battle fleets, Wiesbaden became the center of a hard-fought action that saw the destruction of two British armored cruisers.Tarrant, pp. 127‚Äì141 Wiesbaden remained afloat until the early hours of 1 June and sank sometime between 01:45 and 02:45.Campbell, pp. 294‚Äì295 Frankfurt was also present at Jutland, where she traded blows with .Tarrant, pp. 127‚Äì128Campbell, p. 149 She also saw action during Operation Albion in October 1917,Staff, Battle for the Baltic Islands, pp. 3‚Äì4 and the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in November of that year.Woodward, p. 90 Frankfurt survived the war and was interned at Scapa Flow; her crew was unsuccessful in their attempt to scuttle her,Woodward, p. 183 and she was ultimately surrendered to the United States and expended as a target in 1921. { style=\\"text-align: center;\\" |+ Summary of the Wiesbaden class |- valign=\\"top\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" Ship  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armament  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armor  rowspan=\\"2\\" Displacement  rowspan=\\"2\\" Propulsion  colspan=\\"3\\" Service |- valign=\\"top\\"  Laid down  Commissioned  Fate |- valign=\\"center\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" 8 √ó 15 cm SK L/45 guns rowspan=\\"2\\" 60 mm rowspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" 2 shafts, 2 steam turbines, 27.5 kn rowspan=\\"2\\" 1913 23 August 1915Gr√∂ner, p. 112 Sunk, 1 June 1916 |- valign=\\"center\\"  20 August 1915 Sunk as a target, 18 July 1921 |} =K√∂nigsberg class (1915)= Karlsruhe in Scapa Flow in 1919 The second K√∂nigsberg class was authorized in 1913 and laid down starting in 1914. They were named for cruisers that had been sunk in the early months of the war. They were an incremental improvement over the Wiesbaden class, being some five hundred tons heavier. They carried the standard eight 15 cm guns, the forward wing mounts were placed a deck higher to improve their firing arc. They were otherwise identical to the preceding light cruiser designs. K√∂nigsberg and N√ºrnberg both saw action at the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight, where the former was slightly damaged.Halpern, p. 377 All four members of the class participated in Operation Albion in the Baltic.Staff, Battle for the Baltic Islands, p. 152 The cruisers, save Emden, were also assigned to the planned final fleet action in October 1918,Woodward, p. 116 but mutiny among the German capital ships forced the cancellation of the plan.Tarrant, pp. 281‚Äì282 Karlsruhe, Emden, and N√ºrnberg were interned with the fleet in Scapa Flow, while K√∂nigsberg remained in Germany. The three cruisers were scuttled, though only Karlsruhe actually sank. Emden and N√ºrnberg were beached by British sailors and were seized as war prizes by France and Britain, respectively. Emden was scrapped in 1926 and N√ºrnberg was sunk as a target in 1922. K√∂nigsberg, meanwhile, was surrendered to France in 1920 and renamed Metz; she was ultimately scrapped in 1936. { style=\\"text-align: center;\\" |+ Summary of the K√∂nigsberg class |- valign=\\"top\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" Ship  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armament  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armor  rowspan=\\"2\\" Displacement  rowspan=\\"2\\" Propulsion  colspan=\\"3\\" Service |- valign=\\"top\\"  Laid down  Commissioned  Fate |- valign=\\"center\\"  rowspan=\\"4\\" 8 √ó 15 cm SK L/45 guns rowspan=\\"4\\" 60 mm rowspan=\\"4\\" rowspan=\\"4\\" 2 shafts, 2 steam turbines, 28 kn 1914Gr√∂ner, p. 113 12 August 1916 Scrapped, 1936 |- valign=\\"center\\"  1915 15 November 1916 Scuttled, 21 June 1919 |- valign=\\"center\\"  1914 16 December 1916 Scrapped, 1926 |- valign=\\"center\\"  1915 15 February 1917 Sunk as a target ship, 1922 |} =Brummer class= Brummer arriving in Rosyth at the end of World War I The two Brummer class cruisers were designed in 1914, when the turbines being built by AG Vulcan for the Russian battlecruiser Navarin became available owing to the state of war between Germany and Russia. The German navy instructed AG Vulcan to divide the turbines in half and design a pair of cruiser-minelayers around the propulsion system. As a result of their need for high speed, they were lightly armed, with only four 15 cm guns. And to further aid them in their offensive minelaying role, they were designed to resemble British cruisers to help conceal their identity.Novik, p. 185 Brummer and Bremse typically operated together throughout the war. They participated in numerous minelaying operations in 1916 and 1917.Novik, p. 188 The two cruisers devastated a British convoy to Norway in October 1917, sinking the two escorting destroyers and most of the transports.Halpern, p. 376 Both were interned at Scapa Flow at the end of the war; they were successfully scuttled in June 1919. Brummer remains on the bottom of the harbor, but Bremse was raised for scrapping in 1929 and broken up in the early 1930s. { style=\\"text-align: center;\\" |+ Summary of the Brummer class |- valign=\\"top\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" Ship  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armament  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armor  rowspan=\\"2\\" Displacement  rowspan=\\"2\\" Propulsion  colspan=\\"3\\" Service |- valign=\\"top\\"  Laid down  Commissioned  Fate |- valign=\\"center\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" 4 √ó 15 cm SK L/45 gunsNovik, pp. 185‚Äì188 rowspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" 2 shafts, 2 steam turbines, 28 kn rowspan=\\"2\\" 1915 2 April 1916 Scuttled, 21 June 1919 |- valign=\\"center\\"  1 July 1916 Scuttled, 21 June 1919 |} =C√∂ln class= C√∂ln in Scapa Flow in 1919 By 1916, Germany had lost thirteen light cruisers in the conflict; ten new light cruisers were ordered to a design based on the preceding K√∂nigsberg class.Herwig, p. 205 The new, larger design added a third anti-aircraft gun, along with much more powerful torpedo tubes, compared to the type used in earlier classes. They were otherwise very similar, with the same top speed and armor protection.Gardiner & Gray, pp. 162‚Äì163 Only two ships of the ten were completed: C√∂ln and Dresden. Five other ships were launched, but not completed‚Äîthese ships received names‚Äîand the remaining three had only had some work done to their keels before work ceased. These latter three ships were known only by their contract names. C√∂ln and Dresden had very limited careers, since they were completed so late in the war. They both participated in a fleet sortie into the northern North Sea that attempted to intercept a heavily-escorted convoy from Britain to Norway.Halpern, pp. 418‚Äì419 And they were assigned to the abortive final sortie in October 1918.

The design, which emphasized the reconnaissance role and high speed over combat power, was based on the British s at the request of Kaiser Wilhelm II. As a result, the initial design was much smaller than the C√∂ln design, and it carried only five 15 cm guns, but had a top speed of . Four modified designs followed, with each one increasing in size and armament, until the final design, \\"FK 4\\", had returned to the size and armament of the earlier light cruisers. They were design studies only, and Germany's deteriorating wartime situation in the final two years of the war forced the Navy to all but abandon construction of surface warships in favor of U-boats.Weir, p. 179 { style=\\"text-align: center;\\" |+ Summary of the FK designs |- valign=\\"top\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" Ship  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armament  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armor  rowspan=\\"2\\" Displacement  rowspan=\\"2\\" Propulsion  colspan=\\"3\\" Service |- valign=\\"top\\"  Laid down  Commissioned  Fate |- valign=\\"center\\"  FK 1 rowspan=\\"3\\" 5 √ó 15 cm SK L/45 gunsGr√∂ner, p. 116 rowspan=\\"5\\" ‚Äî 2 shafts, 2 steam turbines,  rowspan=\\"5\\" Design study onlyGr√∂ner, pp. 116‚Äì117 |- valign=\\"center\\"  FK 1a 2 shafts, 2 steam turbines,  |- valign=\\"center\\"  FK 2 Gr√∂ner, p. 117 2 shafts, 2 steam turbines, 32 kn  |- valign=\\"center\\"  FK 3 7 √ó 15 cm SK L/45 guns rowspan=\\"2\\" 2 shafts, 2 steam turbines, 32 kn  |- valign=\\"center\\"  FK 4 8 √ó 15 cm SK L/45 guns  |} Reichsmarine and Kriegsmarine=Emden= Emden in China in 1931 Emden was the first new cruiser designed by the re-formed Reichsmarine in the early 1920s. According to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, new designs could only be .See: Treaty of Versailles Section II: Naval Clauses, Articles 181 and 191 The design borrowed heavily from the late-World War I cruisers. Though the Germans wanted to use twin gun turrets for the ship's main battery of 15 cm guns, the Naval Inter-Allied Commission of Control rejected the design and forced the designers to adopt single turrets in order to weaken the design.Williamson, p. 9O'Brien, p. 112 The design nevertheless included several innovations, including the large- scale use of welding rather than rivets to save weight. During World War II, she was used to lay mines in the North Sea,Rohwer, p. 2 to provide gunfire support to ground troops, and as a convoy escort and training ship for cadets.Williamson, p. 12 She participated in Operation Weser√ºbung, the invasion of Norway in April 1940,Williamson, p. 11 Her wartime career ended in Kiel in April 1945, when British bombers badly damaged the ship while she was in dock for repairs. Her crew ran her aground to prevent her from sinking, and ultimately blew her up with demolition charges to prevent the Allies from capturing her in May.Williamson, p. 13 The wreck was eventually scrapped in the late 1940s. { style=\\"text-align: center;\\" |+ Summary of the Emden class |- valign=\\"top\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" Ship  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armament  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armor  rowspan=\\"2\\" Displacement  rowspan=\\"2\\" Propulsion  colspan=\\"3\\" Service |- valign=\\"top\\"  Laid down  Commissioned  Fate |- valign=\\"center\\"  Emden 8 √ó 15 cm SK L/45 guns 40 mmGr√∂ner, p. 118 2 shafts, 2 steam turbines, 8 December 1921Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 229 15 October 1925 Destroyed, 3 May 1945 |} =K√∂nigsberg class (1927)= A member of the class in 1936 The third class of cruisers named after the capital of East Prussia marked a radical divergence from earlier cruiser designs. A new triple gun turret was adopted for the main battery, with one forward and two aft in a superfiring pair, offset from the centerline. And new, longer C/25 model guns were used. Major use of welding was also a feature of this class of cruisers, and diesel engines were used in combination with the turbines to increase their cruising radius, though only one set of engines could be run at one time. The three ships all participated in the non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War in 1936‚Äì1939. After the outbreak of war, they were used to lay defensive minefields along with Emden,Williamson, pp. 14‚Äì24 and in April 1940, participated in the invasion of Norway.Rohwer, p. 18 Two of the three cruisers, Karlsruhe and K√∂nigsberg, were sunk during the invasion; Karlsruhe was torpedoed by a British submarine off Kristiansand and K√∂nigsberg was sunk by British divebombers in Bergen.Williamson, pp. 17, 21 K√∂ln was used in a variety of roles after the conclusion of the campaign, including as a testbed for operating the Flettner Fl 282 helicopter at sea. She was bombed and sunk by American heavy bombers in Wilhelmshaven in March 1945, though she sank in shallow water on an even keel, which allowed her guns to provide gunfire support to German troops until the end of the war.Williamson, pp. 33‚Äì34Rohwer, p. 404 { style=\\"text-align: center;\\" |+ Summary of the K√∂nigsberg class |- valign=\\"top\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" Ship  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armament  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armor  rowspan=\\"2\\" Displacement  rowspan=\\"2\\" Propulsion  colspan=\\"3\\" Service |- valign=\\"top\\"  Laid down  Commissioned  Fate |- valign=\\"center\\"  K√∂nigsberg rowspan=\\"3\\" 9 √ó 15 cm SK C/25 guns rowspan=\\"3\\" 40 mmGr√∂ner, p. 119 rowspan=\\"3\\" rowspan=\\"3\\" 3 shafts, 4 steam turbines, 2 diesel engines, 32 knGr√∂ner, pp. 119‚Äì120 12 April 1926Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 230 17 April 1929 Sunk, 10 April 1940 |- valign=\\"center\\"  Karlsruhe 27 July 1926 6 November 1929 Sunk, 9 April 1940 |- valign=\\"center\\"  K√∂ln 7 August 1926 15 January 1930 Sunk, 3 March 1945 |} =Leipzig class= N√ºrnberg at sea in 1935 Leipzig and N√ºrnberg were the follow-on class to the three K√∂nigsberg-class ships. They were built to a modified design, which included returning the aft turrets to the centerline. Another major change was a new gear system that allowed the diesel and turbine engines to run at the same time, which permitted a lighter propulsion system to reach the same speed of the earlier ships.Gardiner & Chesneau, pp. 230‚Äì231 They were also fitted with bulbous bows to improve their hydrodynamic efficiency.Whitley, No. 1, p. 235 The two cruisers were not identical: Leipzig had a superstructure similar to the K√∂nigsbergs, while N√ºrnberg was built with a much larger structure. N√ºrnberg was also completed with a much stronger anti-aircraft battery. Both Leipzig and N√ºrnberg were deployed to the non-intervention patrols in Spanish waters in the late 1930s.Williamson, p. 36Whitley, No. 2, p. 250 The British submarine managed to torpedo both cruisers on 13 December 1939, though both ships made it back to port for repairs.Rohwer, pp. 10‚Äì11 The two cruisers were withdrawn from front- line service thereafter and used as training ships.Williamson, p. 37Whitley, No. 2, pp. 252‚Äì254 In October 1944, Leipzig was rammed and badly damaged by the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen; repairs were deemed to be uneconomical, and the crippled ship was used to provide gunfire support to retreating German forces around Gotenhafen (Gdynia) in March 1945. She was used as a barracks ship after the war and scuttled in July 1946.Williamson, pp. 38‚Äì39 N√ºrnberg, meanwhile, was seized by the Soviet Union as a war prize and commissioned into the Soviet Navy as Admiral Makarov; she served in the Baltic Fleet until the late 1950s, and was broken up for scrap sometime around 1960.Whitley, No. 2, pp. 254‚Äì255 { style=\\"text-align: center;\\" |+ Summary of the Leipzig class |- valign=\\"top\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" Ship  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armament  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armor  rowspan=\\"2\\" Displacement  rowspan=\\"2\\" Propulsion  colspan=\\"3\\" Service |- valign=\\"top\\"  Laid down  Commissioned  Fate |- valign=\\"center\\"  Leipzig rowspan=\\"2\\" 9 √ó 15 cm SK C/25 guns rowspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" 3 shafts, 2 steam turbines, 4 diesel engines, 32 kn 28 April 1928Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 231 8 October 1931 Scuttled, July 1946 |- valign=\\"center\\"  N√ºrnberg 1934 2 November 1935 Scrapped, c. 1960 |} =M class= Illustration of the M-class design The M class was authorized by Plan Z in 1939, though design work started as early as 1936; these ships were intended to serve as the reconnaissance units for the commerce raiding squadrons envisioned in the plan.Zabecki, p. 901 The Navy placed very high requirements for long range, heavy armament, armor proof against guns of the ships' caliber, and high speeds, which forced the designers to compromise crucial aspects of the design, including the armor and armament, both of which were too weak. This led the design staff to rework the plans for the last two ships to rectify some of these flaws. Work began on the first two ships in 1938, but the outbreak of war in September 1939 forced the Navy to abandon work on warships that could not be completed quickly. As a result, those two ships were scrapped and the remaining four were never laid down. { style=\\"text-align: center;\\" |+ Summary of the M class |- valign=\\"top\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" Ship  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armament  rowspan=\\"2\\" Armor  rowspan=\\"2\\" Displacement  rowspan=\\"2\\" Propulsion  colspan=\\"3\\" Service |- valign=\\"top\\"  Laid down  Commissioned  Fate |- valign=\\"center\\"  M rowspan=\\"6\\" 8 √ó 15 cm SK C/28 guns rowspan=\\"6\\" 25 mmGr√∂ner, p. 124 rowspan=\\"4\\" rowspan=\\"6\\" 3 shafts, 2 steam turbines, 4 diesel engines, Gr√∂ner, pp. 124‚Äì125 rowspan=\\"2\\" 1938Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 232 rowspan=\\"6\\" ‚Äî rowspan=\\"2\\" Scrapped, 1939Gr√∂ner, p. 125 |- valign=\\"center\\"  N |- valign=\\"center\\"  O rowspan=\\"4\\" ‚Äî rowspan=\\"4\\" ‚Äî |- valign=\\"center\\"  P |- valign=\\"center\\"  Q rowspan=\\"2\\" - valign=\\"center\\"  R |} Notes=FootnotesCitations=References                * Light cruisers German light cruisers ","title":"List of light cruisers of Germany"},{"id":"38630051","text":"Dmitri Kulikov may refer to: * Dmitri Kulikov (footballer) (born 1977), Estonian footballer * Dmitri Kulikov (ice hockey) (born 1990), Russian ice hockey defenceman ","title":"Dmitri Kulikov"},{"id":"38630078","text":"Angellah Jasmine Mbelwa Kairuki (born 10 September 1976) is a Tanzanian politician belonging to the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi party and a special seat Member of Parliament since 2010.

He holds the world record in the 50-mile walk (7:23:50), and the Israeli national record in the 50-kilometer walk (4:17:07). He is a former world champion in the 100-kilometer walk. Ladany survived the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1944, when he was eight years old. In 1972, he survived the Munich Massacre. He is now a Professor of Industrial Engineering and Management at Ben Gurion University, has authored over a dozen books and 120 scholarly papers, and reportedly speaks nine languages. He lives in Omer, Israel. Asked if it would be fair to call him the ultimate survivor, Ladany laughed and answered: \\"I don't know about that. What I can say is that in my life there has never been a dull moment.\\" Early and family life Ladany was born to a Jewish family in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. He has two sisters, Shosh (two years older) and Marta (five years younger, actually his first cousin, adopted by his parents as she was six months old). He and his wife Shosh have been married for over 50 years, and have a daughter and three grandchildren who live in Modi'in. Concentration camp During the Holocaust in Europe, Ladany's maternal grandmother and grandfather were sent to Auschwitz concentration camp, where, Ladany has said, they \\"were made into soap.\\" In April 1941, when he was five years old, the Germans attacked Belgrade and the Luftwaffe bombed his home. His parents fled with him to Hungary. There, when he was eight years old they tried to hide him in a monastery for safekeeping, warning him to keep secret the fact that he was Jewish. He was terrified the entire time that he would be discovered, but says that after that experience he wasn't afraid of anything. In 1944, the eight- year-old was captured by the Nazis with his parents, and shipped to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Many of his family were killed. But in December 1944, he was saved by American Jews who had paid a ransom to have a number of Jews, including him and his parents, released from the concentration camp, where 100,000 Jews had already been killed. Ladany recalled: > I saw my father beaten by the SS, and I lost most of my family there... A > ransom deal that the Americans attempted saved 2,000 Jews and I was one. I > actually went into the gas chamber, but was reprieved. God knows why. Describing the concentration camp, Major Dick Williams, one of the first British soldiers to enter and liberate the camp, said: \\"It was an evil, filthy place; a hell on Earth.\\" Ladany was one of the few of Yugoslavia's 70,000 Jews who survived the Holocaust. He visits the concentration camp every time he is in Europe. He was also there for the 50th anniversary of liberation, and when a Bergen-Belsen museum was dedicated. He was brought on the Kastner train from Bergen-Belsen to Switzerland. After the war ended, he and his family moved back to Belgrade. In December 1948, when he was 12 years old, the family emigrated to Israel, which had just become a nation state. Education Ladany received his B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from the Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology in 1960, and an M.Sc. from Technion in 1961. In 1964, he earned a Graduate Diploma in Business Administration from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1968, he was awarded the Ph.D. in Business Administration by Columbia University, followed by postdoctoral research at Tel Aviv University. Competitive walking career=Early career and Olympics= Ladany began his competitive career as a marathon runner in Israel, when he was 18 years old. He later said \\"in the 1950s, when I started running, people also thought I was a nut. Jews didn't run. They would laugh.\\" He also said that \\"People thought of it only as punishment for soldiers.\\" In his mid-twenties in the early 1960s, he switched to race walking. Ladany walked his first race in 1962. Commenting on the sport, he said \\"You need a certain type of mental attitude: a willingness to take punishment, to have a lack of comfort, and pain, to continue and continue. I'm not a psychologist, but was I stubborn, so I entered race walking? Or did I enter race walking, and become stubborn? It's the same in all long-distance events. Quitters don't win, and winners don't quit.\\" In 1963, he won the first of his 28 Israeli national titles. In 1966, he broke the oldest U.S. track record, which had stood since 1878, in the 50-mile-walk. In April 1968, he again broke the U.S. record in the 50-mile- walk, with a time of 8:05:18 in New Jersey. In 1968, at the age of 32, Ladany competed in his first Olympics ‚Äì the 1968 Olympics ‚Äì in the 50-kilometer walk (31 miles, 121 yards) in Mexico City. He finished in 24th place, with a time of 5 hours, 1 minute, and 6 seconds. He trained and competed without a coach. At the 8th Maccabiah Games in July 1969, he won a gold medal in the 3-km walk (13.35.4). Then at the 1973 Maccabiah Games, he won the 10-km walk and the 50-km walk. In early 1972, Ladany set a world record in the 50-mile walk in a time of 7:44:47, shattering the world mark that had stood since 1935. In April 1972, he lowered his world record to 7:23:50, in New Jersey; a world record time that still stands today. He also holds the Israeli national record in the 50-kilometer walk, at 4:17:07, which he also set in 1972. In September 1972, he returned as the sole male member of the Israeli track and field team, to compete in the 50-kilometer walk in the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany. He said he wanted to show the Germans that a Jew had survived, and he wore a Star of David on his warm-up jersey. When he was congratulated by locals on his fluent German, he responded: \\"I learned it well when I spent a year at Bergen Belsen\\". Asked about competing in Germany, the Holocaust survivor said: \\"I don't say I have to hate Germans. Of course not the younger generation, but I have no special sympathy for the older generation who have been accused of what happened in the Nazi period.\\" Ladany finished his race in 19th place, with a time of 4 hours, 24 minutes, and 38 seconds. Asked how he felt, he replied: \\"Arrogant because of what the Germans did to me; proud because I am a Jew\\". He then returned to the athletes' Olympic Village and went to sleep. =Munich Massacre= In the early hours of September 5, 1972, the Munich Massacre began. Eight rifle-carrying Palestinian terrorists, who were members of the Black September faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization, broke into the Israeli quarters in the Olympic Village to take the Israeli Olympic delegation athletes and coaches hostage.Neil Amdur,\\"Ladany, an Ultimate Survivor, Recalls Painful Memories\\", New York Times, July 13, 2008. The terrorists captured wrestling coach Moshe Weinberg. They shot and killed Weinberg, and threw his body out a window onto the sidewalk. > Early in the morning somebody wakens me, I open my eyes and that's when my > roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by > Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so > without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the > apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village > and they were speaking to somebody that was standing in the entrance to > apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and I > listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something is very > dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red > Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the > man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane?', and the man > replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane > either.' At that point I understood that something is going on and I closed > the door. Another team member took Ladany to the window and pointed to the blood stains outside the apartment. They decided to leave the apartment via the rear of their apartment that backed onto a lawn, despite knowing that they would be visible to the terrorists. > The terrorists from the second floor, from apartment number one, had a clear > view from the window and we moved out, walked along the lawn without running > or zigzagging but in strong and confident legs. Maybe it was stupid? But we > had done so....we left the apartment through the lawn. Surviving terrorist Jamal Al-Gashey revealed that Ladany was spotted racing away from the building leading the terrorists to believe that they were too late to take any hostages in Apartment number two, though several were still inside the apartment. Ladany ran around to the building housing the U.S. team and banged on the ground-floor apartment belonging to the team coaches. He awoke the American track coach Bill Bowerman, who alerted the German police. Bowerman called for the U.S. Marines to come and protect American Jewish Olympians swimmer Mark Spitz and javelin thrower Bill Schmidt. Ladany was the first person to spread the alert as to the attack, and was one of only five Israeli team members to escape. Weinberg and 10 other Israeli Olympic athletes and coaches were kidnapped and killed by the terrorists. A number of television, radio, and newspaper reports listed Ladany as one of those killed. One headline stated: \\"Ladany Could Not Escape his Fate in Germany for a Second Time\\". Ladany recalled later: > The impact did not hit me at the time, when we were in Munich. It was when > we arrived back in Israel. At the airport in Lod there was a huge crowd ‚Äì > maybe 20,000, people ‚Äì and each one of us, the survivors, stood by one of > the coffins on the runway. Some friends came up to me and tried to kiss me > and hug me as if I was almost a ghost that came back alive. It was then that > I really grasped what had happened and the emotion hit me. Three Black September members survived and were arrested at a Munich prison, but the West German authorities decided to release them the following month in exchange for the hostages of hijacked Lufthansa Flight 615 Two of the released Black September members were later killed, as were others who organized the Munich Massacre, by Israeli's Mossad during Operation Wrath of God. In 1992, speaking of the massacre, Ladany said: \\"It's with me all the time, and I remember every detail\\". He visits the graves of his murdered teammates in Tel Aviv every year, on September 6. In 2012, the International Olympic Committee decided to not hold a minute of silence before the start of the 2012 Olympic Games, to honor the 11 Israeli Olympians who were killed 40 years prior. Jacques Rogge, the IOC President, said it would be \\"inappropriate\\". Speaking of the decision, Ladany commented: \\"I do not understand. I do not understand, and I do not accept it.\\" =Later career= Ladany returned to competition two months later, against the wishes of the Israeli track and field authorities. The specialist in ultra long distance walking competed in the 1972 World Championships, in Lugano, Switzerland. He won the gold medal in the 100-km walk, in a time of 9:31:00. At the 1973 Maccabiah Games, he won the 20-km and 50-km walks. In 1976, Ladany set the U.S. record in the 75-kilometer walk for the second year in a row. He became the first person ever to win both the American Open and American Masters (40 years and over) 75-kilometer walking championships. He repeated the feat in 1977 and 1981 (by which time the event had become a 100-km race). He won the Israeli national walking championship 28 times from 1963‚Äì88. He won the U.S. national walking championship six times (from 1973‚Äì81; including the 75-km championships in 1974‚Äì77, and the 100-km title in 1974), won the Belgian national walking championship twice (1971 and 1972), won the national walking championship in Switzerland (1972), and won the South Africa national walking championship (1975). His personal best in the 50-kilometer walk is 4:17:06 (1972). He has continued to compete with considerable success at the masters level into his seventies. In 2006, he became the first 70-year-old to walk 100 miles in under 24 hours, setting a world record in Ohio of 21 hours, 45 minutes, 34 seconds. In 2012, at the age of 75, he was still competing in 35 events a year, and claimed to walk \\"[...] a minimum of 15 kilometers a day\\", and participates in \\"[...] a four-day, 300-kilometer walk from Paris to Tubize, near Brussels.\\" On every birthday he walks his age in kilometers, so on his birthday in 2012 he went on a 76-km walk in Israel's southern Negev desert. He estimates he has walked 6,000‚Äì7,000 miles a year, for a lifetime total of over half a million miles. In his career, Ladany has never had a coach. When asked what he enjoyed most about walking, he answered \\"Finishing\\". Academic career In his academic life, Ladany was a Lecturer of at the Tel Aviv University Graduate School of Business and, for over three decades, a Professor of Industrial Engineering and Management at Ben Gurion University of the Negev, where he was formerly Chairman of the department and is now emeritus professor. He has had visiting appointments at Columbia University, University of California, Irvine, Georgia Tech, Emory University, Rutgers University, City University of New York, Temple University, University of Cape Town, Science Center Berlin, Singapore University, and CSIRO (Melbourne). He focuses on quality control and applied statistics. He has also authored over a dozen scholarly books and 110 scientific articles. He holds U.S. patents for eight mechanical designs. Philately Ladany is a philatelist. His collection of telegraph stamps and associated material was sold by Spink & Son in Lugano in 2015.\\"Forthcoming event\\", Spink Insider, No. 23 (Winter 2015), pp. 60-62. Autobiography In 1997, his autobiography was published in Hebrew, entitled The Walk to the Olympics. In 2008, it was published in English, entitled King of the Road: The Autobiography of an Israeli Scientist and a World Record-Holding Race Walker (Gefen Publishing). In 2012, a biography was written about him in Italian by Andrea Schiavon, and published under the title: Cinque cerrchi e una stella ‚Äì Shaul Ladany, da Bergen-Belsen a Monaco '72 (ADD Editore, Torino). Hall of fame and awards In 2007, Ladany was awarded the Pierre de Coubertin Medal for outstanding service to the Olympic Movement. He was cited as a special person with \\"unusual outstanding sports achievements during a span covering over four decades.\\" Ladany said he would set up an NIS10,000 Olympic race- walking fund, and offer NIS1,000 to any Israeli who can complete the 50-kilometer race in less than five hours. In 2008, the Israeli Industrial Engineering Association awarded Ladany with its Life Achievement award. He was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2012.

It was previously called The White City. The park included a number of roller coasters, other rides and numerous funhouses. History The amusement park was established in the 1870s after entrepreneur George Kelsey extended the trolley lines and built a 1,500-foot pier at the end of Beach Street to accommodate a ferry service. Kelsey built the nearby Seaview Hotel, with rooms for up to 150 guests. A beachside resort grew around the hotel and pier, including a bandstand, a fountain, an observatory, a wooded area for picnics, and a carousel which was revolved first by manpower and later by a horse on a treadmill. Amusements were built by other businessmen, and soon the park had a zoo, a museum and a dance hall. Promoters organized cock fights, horse races and prize fights. In 1903 carnival rides were added and the area was officially opened as an amusement park called the White City with an entrance at the corner of Savin Avenue and Thomas Street. Around it, taking in Rock, Campbell and Beach streets, were theaters, restaurants and hotels.Savin Rock Park: ‚ÄúConnecticut‚Äôs Coney Island‚Äù.

He was a leader of the student movement Otpor! that helped topple Serbian president Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá.Liel Leibovitz, \\"The Revolutionist: The secret architect of the Arab Spring casts an eye on Occupy Wall Street,\\" The Atlantic Magazine (6 February 2012). After briefly pursuing a political career in Serbia, he established the Centre for Applied Nonviolent Action and Strategies (CANVAS) in 2003 and published Blueprint for Revolution in 2015. CANVAS has worked with pro-democracy activists from more than 50 countries, promoting the use of non- violent resistance in achieving political and social goals. In October 2017, he was elected Rector of the University of St Andrews, succeeding Catherine Stihler. Early life Popoviƒá was born in Belgrade, where both of his parents worked in television.Steve York, Miriam Zimmerman, Peter Ackerman, Jack DuVall, \\"A Force More Powerful,\\" Retrieved 14 May 2014.

They released one album in 1993 called Izmeƒëu bo≈æanstva i ni≈°tavila. Political career In parallel to music, Popoviƒá joined the Democratic Party's (DS) youth wing called Demokratska omladina. At the party conference in January 1994, he became the president of Demokratska omladina working under the also newly elected party leader Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá. Although remaining a DS member, in 1998 with the establishment of Otpor!, Popoviƒá's activity in the party took a back seat to his engagement with the new movement. Shortly after the overthrow of Milo≈°eviƒá, Popoviƒá left Otpor! to return to his political career in Serbia, becoming a Democratic Party (DS) MP in the National Assembly as well as an environmental adviser to newly appointed prime minister Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá.Bringing Down The Dictator ;PBS 2002 Books Popoviƒá is the co-author with Matthew Miller of Blueprint for Revolution: How to Use Rice Pudding, Lego Men, and Other Non-Violent Techniques to Galvanize Communities, Overthrow Dictators, or Simply Change the World (2015).http://www.blueprintforrevolution.com/https://www.theguardian.com/global- development-professionals-network/2015/mar/11/review-blueprint-handbook-for- activists-srjdja-popovic Blueprint for Revolution was met with positive reviews The Guardian called it \\"fantastically readable\\" and \\"brilliant\\", pointing to the usefulness and ingenuity of the ideas for creative nonviolent dissent it offers. Critic Tina Rosenberg (The New York Times) wrote that the work of Popoviƒá and ƒêinoviƒá draws on the insights of Gene Sharp, a pioneer and leading theorist in the field of nonviolent resistance, but also manages to \\"refine\\" and extend his key ideas. The review also praised the book for challenging conventional wisdom on the efficacy of peaceful movements and \\"cheerfully blowing up\\" common misconceptions about their internal structure, tactics, and chances of success. Blueprint for Revolution was nominated for the Atlantic Magazine's book of the month. It was originally published in the United States as well as in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Serbia. It has since been translated into Serbian, French, German, Spanish, and Turkish. Popoviƒá has been on book promoting tours in both the US and UK. Popoviƒá has also authored or co-authored various CANVAS publications, available for free on the organization's website. Nonviolent Struggle: 50 Crucial Points and the CANVAS Core Curriculum: A Guide to Effective Nonviolent Struggle both elaborate on how activists should approach the vital stages of organizing a nonviolent movement: comparatively assessing their capabilities against those of the regime, formulating a clear plan for action, implementing it as efficiently as possible, and responding to ensuing repression from the authorities without jeopardizing their goals and commitment to nonviolence. Making Oppression Backfire, which Popovic co-authored with Tori Porell, more specifically examines how activists can make significant gains in the asymmetrical struggle against a regime's repressive apparatus, through knowledge and preparation. It illustrates two key principles - firstly, that of \\"creating a dilemma\\" for the regime, which has to either tolerate the movement's actions and appear powerless or respond with force and risk alienating members of the larger community or publicly embarrassing itself. Secondly, it provides insights into how to best take care of the movement's \\"foot soldiers\\" ‚Äì its activists and demonstrators- foster cohesion, and cultivate a sense of community. The site also contains a brief illustrated chronology of the evolution of Otpor! and an examination of the unique features which allowed it to win over a large number of Serbs and mobilize solidarity to effect a profound political transformation. Activism=Otpor!= Popoviƒá was one of the founders and leaders of the Serbian nonviolent resistance group Otpor!. It was founded in Belgrade on 10 October 1998, by a small group of student protestors, in direct response to the University and Media Acts (passed earlier the same year). The organization was founded as a leaderless movement implementing the principles of nonviolent resistance in order to oppose the violent policies of the Milosevic regime and its constant infringements upon Serbs' fundamendal democratic rights. In December 1998, Otpor organized its first major gathering - at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering. The demonstrators, about a thousand university students, then marched to the Faculty of Philosophy, in solidarity with their peers who had been locked up by the authorities in the latter so that they would be unable to join the peaceful protest. Just two days later, about seventy Otpor members took part in the \\"We are paving the way\\" march and walked the 83 km distance between Belgrade and Novi Sad. After the NATO bombing, Otport somewhat changed its goals and focused on campaigns which often provoked the regime in humorous and ironic ways, thus drawing citizens' attention and raising their motivation. One vivid example was the \\"birthday party for Milo≈°eviƒá\\" demonstration organized in Ni≈°, during which more than two thousand citizens had a chance to write down what they wished Mr Milosevic for his birthday on a joint birthday card. Along with the card, gifts, including a one-way ticket to the Hague, prison uniform, books by Mira Markovic, handcuffs and a birthday cake in the shape of a five-pointed star served to everybody present at the end of the action, were received on behalf of president Milosevic. Numerous campaigns such as this one mobilized the whole of Serbia, alleviated Serbs' fear of violent reprisals by the regime, and inspired confidence. The most important ones took place in the period 1999‚Äì2000, allowing Otpor to evolve from a students' to a people's democratic movement. It rapidly gained popularity among student activists and expanded from a small organization to a large network of activists and supporters. The resistance movement attracted a diverse range of opposition leaders and brought them together for discussions, from which the resistance movement established common goals against the Milosevic regime. These goals were concretely articulated in the ¬®Declaration for the Future of Serbia¬®, issued in July, 1999. The Declaration became Otpor's strategic document defining the main problems, objectives of the movement and the methods to be used. What is more, it was endorsed and signed by prominent critics of the regime and all important student organizations in Serbia, becoming the cornerstone of a united, coherent, resistance to Milo≈°eviƒá. Persistent resistance, sympathetic media coverage, and the international attention it attracted allowed the Otpor! movement to finally pressure Milo≈°eviƒá to step down from the presidency. Shortly after the 5 October 2000 revolution, Popoviƒá left Otpor! to pursue a political career in Serbia, becoming a Democratic Party (DS) MP in the Serbian assembly as well as an environmental adviser to prime minister Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá. =CANVAS= In 2003, Popoviƒá and former Otpor! member Slobodan ƒêinoviƒá co-founded the Centre for Applied Non Violent Actions and Strategies (CANVAS), an organization that advocates for the use of nonviolence resistance to promote human rights and democracy. Established in Belgrade, CANVAS has worked with pro-democracy activists from more than 50 countries,Rosenberg, Tina (16 February 2011) \\"Revolution U ‚Äì What Egypt learned from the students who overthrew Milosevic,\\" Foreign Policy Retrieved 20 July 2011 including Iran, Zimbabwe, Burma, Venezuela, Ukraine, Georgia, Palestine, Western Sahara, West Papua, Eritrea, Belarus, Azerbaijan and Tonga and, recently, Tunisia and Egypt.Di Giovanni, Janine (18 March 2011) \\"Blueprint for a revolution\\", Financial Times. Retrieved 20 July 2011. Shortly after its founding, the organization trained a number of young Georgian activists who formed a vital part of the movement which elected young Mikheil Saakashvili. A year later, CANVAS played a similar role in Ukraine's Organge Revolution. In the Maldives, the popular movement against the president's oppressive rule drew from Popoviƒá's insights on the role of humor and satire in nonviolent struggle, and soon managed to gain support from prominent musicians, artists, and popular figures. Despite many observers' doubts about the applicability of nonviolent tactics to a small nation with an overwhelmingly Islamic culture, like the Maldives, the activists eventually prevailed; in 2008, they watched the old regime fall down, when President Gayoom was compelled to amend the Constitution to allow for genuine multi-party presidential elections and subsequently lost to opposition candidate Mohamed Nasheed. On the eve of the Arab Spring, CANVAS provided training to a number of young activists from Egypt and Tunisia. Some of the training sessions and their impact on the participants were described in Popoviƒá's Blueprint for Revolution. It has been estimated that Iranian activists downloaded Popoviƒá's guide to nonviolent struggle more than 17,000 times, when protests against Mahmoud Ahmadinedjad began in 2007. Canvas has several full-time employees and simultaneously operates an international network of trainers and experts with experience in successful non-violent movements. Since CANVAS relies on private funding, there is no fee for attending workshops led by its trainers worldwide and revolutionary know-how can also be downloaded for free online. In 2006, Popoviƒá and two other CANVAS members - Slobodan ƒêinoviƒá and Andrej Milivojeviƒá - authored a book called Nonviolent Struggle: 50 Crucial Points, a how-to guide for nonviolent struggle. In November 2011, Popoviƒá was one of the speakers at the TEDx Krak√≥w conference. His speech, titled \\"How to Topple a Dictator\\", focused on the phenomenon of \\"people power\\" and the new opportunities for the mobilization of this power recent developments have offered. While people power has effected political transformations for centuries, claims Popovich, activists nowadays can much more readily learn reproducible, reliable tactics for nonviolent resistance and use the new media to advance their movement. At the same time, he articulates there timeless principles, which precede the success of any nonviolent revolution: unity, planning, and discipline. Since the video of his speech was released in December 2011, it has received over 250,000 views. Popovic has also spoken at the Oslo Freedom Forum, a leading world conference which brings together activists and political dissidents from around the world, dubbed \\"the Davos for human rights\\" by The Economist. His first talk at the Forum, \\"Revolution 101\\", offered a historical overview of nonviolent movements, examining their often underappreciated rates of success and capacity to bring about more enduring democracies. Whereas the 20th century centered on the arms race, Popovic suggested in his talk, that the 21st century must focus on the race for education, as the tool through which people will change the world and oppose brutal regimes. In a more recent edition of the Forum, in 2017, he took part in a discussion panel outlining strategies for peacefully countering the troubling rise of illiberalism in the West in the last few years. Popovic participated in the 2017 San Francisco Freedom Forum, also organized by the Human Rights Foundation. Other activities=Green Fist= Simultaneous to his early 2000s political engagement, Popoviƒá, together with former colleagues from Otpor! Predrag Leƒçiƒá and Andreja Stamenkoviƒá, founded the environmental non-governmental organization named Green Fist. Conceptualized as an \\"ecological movement\\", it attempted to transfer some of Otpor's mass appeal into environmental issues by using similar imagery, but soon folded. =Ecotopia= Popoviƒá heads the Ecotopia fund, the non-profit organization dealing with the environmental issues, financially backed by various Serbian governmental institutions as well as the private sector. In 2009, the fund organized a wide environmental campaign featuring well-known Serbian actors and media personalities with television spots and newspaper ads.Duncan Greene, \\"Review: Blueprint for Revolution, a fantastically readable and useful handbook for activists\\" \\"The Guardian\\" (11 March 2015). =Waging Nonviolence= In 2009, Popovic became a founding member of the board of advisers of Waging Nonviolence, \\"a source for original news and analysis about struggles for justice and peace around the globe.\\"Michael Barker \\"Conspiracy Theories and Nonviolence\\" The Real News, 6 January 2013Bryan Farrell \\"Are activists being used as spies?\\" Waging Nonviolence, 20 November 2013 Popovic was removed from the board in the wake of the Stratfor controversy (see below).Stephen Zunes \\"Barker's Bizarre Attacks Against Progressive Scholars\\" The Real News, =Teaching= In addition to activism, Popovic also runs educational workshops and lectures at a variety of forums and universities.

Popovic and the Centre for Applied Nonviolent Actions and Strategies have partnered with Northeastern University's Co-Op program, hosting interns and running them through nonviolence workshops. = 53rd Rector of the University of St Andrews = Popoviƒá was one of two contenders in the 2017 rectorial elections for the position of rector of the University of St Andrews. The rector is elected every three years by the matriculated students of the university. Popoviƒá was elected Rector on 13 October 2017, garnering more than twice the votes of his opponent Willie Rennie. Honors and awards Foreign Policy magazine listed Popoviƒá as one of the \\"Top 100 Global Thinkers\\" of 2011 for inspiring the Arab Spring protesters directly and indirectly and educating activists about nonviolent social change in the Middle East.Kedar Pavgi, \\"The FP Top 100 Global Thinkers,\\" Foreign Policy Magazine (28 November 2011). In January 2012, The Wired included him among the \\"50 people who will change the world\\".

Before this the town's principal assembly rooms had been at the Hart's Head in Bull Street, which had served this purpose since 1649. Assemblies were held weekly at Sawyer's and included dancing, conversation and games of cards. Regular subscription concert series were also given at Sawyer's from the 1740s by Barnabas Gunn and John Eversman often being followed by a ball. The reputation of Sawyer's room as a fashionable venue never recovered from the visit of the Duke of York in 1765, when he remarked that \\"a town of such magnitude as Birmingham, and adorned with so much beauty, deserved a superior accommodation, that the room itself was mean, but the entrance still meaner\\" As a result of this insult, new assembly rooms were built at the Royal Hotel in Temple Row, funded by subscription and opening in 1772.

After the war he became Commander of the Minnesota Department of the Grand Army of the Republic. Early life Marty was born in Switzerland on August 2, 1837. When Marty was two, his father immigrated to the United States, settling in Stillwater. Marty's mother died when he was six. He was raised by his aunt and uncle in Switzerland until the family immigrated to St. Louis, Missouri. They moved to Stillwater when Marty was twelve. Marty lived with his father for a time, but they had a strained relationship as Marty grew older. Before the Civil War, Marty worked as a farmhand for local land owner Henry Jackman. At the age of eighteen he began an apprenticeship under Mort Webster, a Stillwater carriage painter. When news of the outbreak of the Civil War reached Stillwater, Marty enlisted in a local militia unit called the Stillwater Guards. Three of Marty's cousins also enlisted, including Samuel Bloomer. Marty and Bloomer were close and remained so throughout the war years and beyond. On April 29, 1861, Marty and his fellow guards marched to Fort Snelling and were enlisted in the First Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment. The Stillwater Guards became Company B of the regiment. First Minnesota Volunteer Infantry As a member of the First Minnesota, Adam Marty fought in many early Civil War battles such as Bull Run, Ball's Bluff, and the Peninsula Campaign. In a series of letters, Marty would document the experiences of himself and a core group of friends: Rufus Blanchard, John Densmore, Oscar Cornman, and his closest friend and cousin, Sam Bloomer. Adam called this group a ‚Äúgood jolly crew.‚Äù Together they would fight in nearly every battle, up until the Battle of Antietam. On September 17, 1862, his friend Oscar would die, shot through the head, while his cousin Sam would get shot in the leg while carrying the regimental colors. Bloomer's leg required amputation, and he eventually returned home to Stillwater, serving in the Invalid Corps. Marty continued to serve with the First Minnesota through the battles of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, and ultimately Gettysburg. Though Marty no longer had Cornman and Bloomer by his side, he still had John and Rufus who would fight by Marty's side in the most pivotal battle of the Civil War. On July 2, 1863, the First Minnesota was ordered to charge a numerically superior Confederate force in order to protect the Union line at Gettysburg. The First Minnesota took the highest casualties of any regiment during the war: eighty- two percent. Company B entered the battle with thirty-six men, by the end of the charge only six remained standing. Marty and Rufus were among the wounded. A musket ball tore a large hole in his Marty's right thigh. Rufus would get a piece of shrapnel in his side, and be forever known as ‚ÄúOld Ironsides.‚Äù And John Densmore would die on the battlefield carrying the colors of the First Minnesota. After being wounded Marty was sent to South Street Hospital in Philadelphia. He was bedridden for several agonizing months. Eventually he healed enough to get out and socialize, making friends and attending cultural events. In April 1864 Marty traveled home to Minnesota and was mustered out with the rest of the First Minnesota Volunteers on May 5, 1864. Post-Civil War After the war Marty returned to Stillwater and worked as a carriage painter. He had no lasting physical limitations from his war service. He married Ottilie Hoffman in 1869, but she died in childbirth in 1870 along with the couple's daughter. In 1884 he married Augusta Burrow. They had four children: Carl, Raymond, Arline, and Milton. In 1872 Marty was a charter member of the Stillwater Fire Department. He was appointed deputy sheriff in 1882. In 1890, he was elected sheriff of Washington County, serving two terms. Marty was also deeply involved in the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR). He joined Stillwater's Muller Post in 1875 and served as post commander for six terms. In 1881, Marty was elected Commander of the statewide organization. Together he and Bloomer rejuvenated the GAR in Minnesota. Marty also helped form the \\"Last Man's Club\\" in 1887 for members of Company B. It was the first of its kind in the nation. The members created an annual reunion on the anniversary of the Battle of Bull Run. As members died their chair would be draped in black. After 1910, Marty moved to St. Paul. His wife died in 1922 and Marty then moved in with his daughter. He died at her home February 7, 1923, and was buried in Fairview Cemetery in Stillwater.

Premiering at the 2012 Whistler Film Festival, it began a limited run at theatres in Western Canada on March 1, 2013. The film was produced by Alliance Films and funded by Kokanee, a British Columbia-based brewery owned by the Labatt Brewing Company. The concept for the film was conceived by the staff of Grip Limited, an advertising agency who had worked on various campaigns for Kokanee in the past, and served as the first foray into branded content for both Grip and Labatt. Alongside traditional product placement, the film features appearances by popular characters from Kokanee's past advertising campaigns, and was the culmination of a multi-platform marketing campaign that was intended to encourage user engagement and crowdsourcing to help promote the film. Reception to The Movie Out Here was largely negative, with critics panning its over-reliance on product placement, lewd content, and gross-out humour. Kokanee considered the film and campaign to be successful, having increased its market share by 6%,  Plot  Adam (Robin Neilsen), a lawyer from Toronto, returns to his hometown of Fernie, British Columbia and discovers that a ski waxing business run by his friend Theo (James Wallis) is under threat by a real estate developer, prompting them to hold a party as a fundraiser.  Production  The advertising agency Grip has been involved in several major campaigns for Kokanee. In recent years, the agency had put a focus on campaigns incorporating user engagement, regional pride, and social media: in its 2008 campaign \\"Live or Die\\", users voted to have Kokanee's popular Ranger mascot killed off in an upcoming advertisement. The campaign was followed up in 2011 by a campaign featuring the Ranger's ghost encouraging users to vote via Facebook in an election to determine the new Kokanee Ranger. After Labatt requested a \\"big\\" idea for their next campaign, Grip's creative director Randy Stein suggested that they produce a film, taking advantage of the continuing narrative portrayed by Kokanee's past advertising campaigns. Stein had expressed curiosity surrounding the concept of branded content‚Äîa form of entertainment content produced in collaboration with an advertiser. He believed that the film's target audience had become more accepting of branded entertainment, but still did not want to have advertising \\"shoved down their throats.\\" Kokanee and Alliance Films officially announced The Movie Out Here in May 2012; its title alluding to Kokanee's long-time slogan \\"The Beer Out Here\\". The Movie Out Here was produced in an unconventional manner in contrast to most feature films; the film had already received financing and promotion from Labatt before its screenplay was even completed. Aside from executive producer Jeff Sackman, the film was written, produced, and directed by Grip staff members. The film was described as a lewd, \\"feel-good\\" comedy about a group of friends who had reunited in the city of Fernie and want to \\"kind of go back to their roots.\\" The film was also designed to pay tribute to life in Western Canada, including its landscape, communities, and its bars. The release of The Movie Out Here came at a period of financial struggle for Canada's beer industry: a National Hockey League lockout that shortened the 2012-13 season reduced sales of beer in Canada by 12% overall, requiring the company to use new strategies to promote its products. The film was targeted towards males in their mid-20s, a key market for beer that has also struggled due to increasing competition from distilled beverages. Alongside traditional product placement, The Movie Out Here also incorporates popular characters from Kokanee's past advertising campaigns, such as the Ranger, the Glacier Girls, and the Sasquatch. Kokanee's brand manager Amy Rawlinson explained that the film should not be considered a \\"90-minute beer commercial\\", and was conceived from the start to be a \\"stand-alone\\" film. Rawlinson was more concerned about the emotional aspects of Kokanee's presence in the film rather than the number of times it appears. Distribution=Promotion= Expanding on the social media campaigns that Grip had created for the brewery in the past, a multi-platform advertising campaign was built around the production and release of The Movie Out Here, with a particular emphasis on the use of engagement marketing. Elements of crowdsourcing were used as part of the film's marketing strategy: through Kokanee's website, users could upload and vote on video auditions for 5 minor roles in the film, vote on the music to be incorporated into its soundtrack, submit props, and register to be one of 3,500 people that would be listed as a \\"fan\\" in its credits. Twenty bars in Western Canada also competed to become a filming location for The Movie Out Here; voting required users to enter a code off a specially-marked coaster obtained when ordering a Kokanee, thus encouraging further sales. Some bars also used tablets on-site to encourage customers to vote immediately after their order. =Release= The Movie Out Here premiered at the Whistler Film Festival on November 30, 2012. The film began a limited release at theatres in Canada's western provinces (such as British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan) on March 1, 2013.  Reception  The Movie Out Here was critically panned for its poor storyline, reliance on gross-out humour, and its excessive product placement. John Lekich of The Georgia Straight described the film as an \\"abomination\\" consisting of \\"90 minutes of product placement slapped onto a foul-mouthed comedy so inherently worthless it‚Äôs almost enough to make me hate beer. Not just Kokanee. Any beer.\\" Katherine Monk of Postmedia News gave The Movie Out Here a 1.5 out of 5; sharing similar criticisms, Monk described the film as being a product of a \\"Toronto boardroom\\" with a clich√© plot, and doubted whether its writers were even trying to make it a \\"real\\" movie. She concluded that The Movie Out Here was not \\"[a] celebration of British Columbia's culture\\", but a film which \\"pimps it out for sudsy profits using boobies, fart jokes and sexist references to slutty girlfriends and casual intercourse.\\" Randy Stein believed that the response to The Movie Out Here by critics did not matter, and his staff even predicted that \\"hardcore film reviewers\\" would either \\"go in wanting to hate this film\\", or not even review it at all. He went on to report that the film had received a positive response from its target audience via social media. Among the theatres that screened the film in Vancouver, The Movie Out Here was the #4 film on its opening weekend. Kokanee's promotional efforts also had a positive impact on its beer sales; by the end of the nine-month campaign supporting the film, Kokanee had experienced a 6% increase in market share.

At , the building is one of the largest neighborhood recreation centers in New York City, containing a 25-yard six lane pool, volleyball court, basketball court, fitness rooms, dance studios, game rooms, and a computer resource center. The center hosts a wide range of community- oriented classes and events, many of which are free to youth and older adults. History In 1964 the previous Chelsea Recreation Center, the former Chelsea Bathhouse at 407 West 28th Street, was demolished to make way for the construction of the Morgan Annex postal facility. Construction began on a replacement recreation center on June 3, 1974, but was abandoned on January 19, 1976 due to the New York City fiscal crisis of 1975. Windows were sealed over with concrete and steel girders left exposed, with an air conditioner unit remaining on the roof for when construction resumed. Completion of the facility was a consistent request at neighborhood meetings over the next 25 years, and neighborhood groups even hired a consultant and an architect to help make their case to the city. When New York City experienced an economic upswing in the early 2000s financing was made available to complete the recreation center. On June 7, 2001 Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, state senator Thomas Duane, and city council members including Peter Vallone, Jr. and Christine Quinn swung gold sledgehammers against a brick wall to mark the resumption of construction. A five-panel mural consisting of 175,000 tiles based on dolphin photographs by Tsuneo Nakamura was installed next to the pool as a gift by the Italian Trade Commission and Bisazza Mosaico. The center was completed at a final cost of $22.4 million on May 11, 2004, and was inaugurated by Mayor Michael Bloomberg at a ribbon-cutting ceremony in the center's gymnasium. Membership Membership is free for children under age 18. Adult membership currently costs $150 per year, though for young adults ages 18-24, the price was set at $25 per year. Members over age 62 also pay $25 per year. Improving public health is seen as a priority of the Michael Bloomberg administration, justifying city-run community recreation centers with fees below those of private health clubs.

He was the regiment's color sergeant, and after the war he was deeply involved in civic life and the Grand Army of the Republic. Early life Bloomer was born in Switzerland on November 30, 1835. He immigrated to the United States in 1846 with family, including his first cousin, Adam Marty. The family settled in St. Louis for a time before moving to Stillwater. Bloomer worked on the Henry Jackman farm and as a carpenter. He was a member of the \\"Wide Awakes\\", a group that supported Lincoln during the 1860 election. First Minnesota Volunteer Infantry When news of the Civil War reached Minnesota, Bloomer and his cousins joined the Stillwater Guards, a local militia group. The Guards were mustered into the First Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment at Fort Snelling on April 29, 1861, forming the nucleus of Company B. Bloomer was initially given the rank of corporal and participated in all the regiment's major engagements until the Battle of Antietam. He was wounded slightly in the head at the Battle of Bull Run. During the Battle of Savage's Station on June 29, 1862, which was part of the Peninsula Campaign, Bloomer was promoted to color sergeant. In the midst of the engagement the standard bearer was killed. Bloomer picked up the colors, and was separated from the regiment for five hours. He returned the colors to the regiment and was promoted for his bravery. While carrying the colors during the Battle of Antietam, Bloomer received a gunshot wound below his right knee. He crawled to safety behind a nearby oak tree as the First Minnesota retreated. Bloomer lay there until the next day when Confederate soldiers carried him to a barn. Eventually Bloomer came into the care of his comrades when the Confederates retreated. On September 20, 1862, his leg was amputated. Bloomer spent the rest of his service in military hospitals until he was discharged on December 2, 1862. He returned to Stillwater, but became very restless and heartbroken when a local woman refused his proposal of marriage. He accepted a commission as a lieutenant in the Veteran Reserve Corps. He served until September 19, 1866, when he was mustered out. Later life During his Reserve Corps service he met Matilda J. Burns and married her on December 6, 1863. They had four children together. The couple resided in Stillwater after Bloomer's service. The veteran worked as a guard at the Stillwater Prison, as an insurance agent, and sewing machine salesman. In September 1875 Bloomer caught his wife committing adultery. They were divorced in 1878 and Bloomer received custody of the children. He married his second wife, Ellen Pressell, in 1882. Bloomer was subsequently employed as Washington County Treasurer for six years, and established a summer camp on White Bear Lake afterward. Like his cousin Adam Marty, Bloomer was deeply involved in the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR). He was appointed Assistant Adjutant General of the GAR by Marty in 1881 and played a pivotal role in reestablishing the organization in Minnesota. He was a member of both Acker Post in St. Paul and Muller Post in Stillwater. In addition to the Grand Army of the Republic, Bloomer was a member of the Last Man's Club along with most of Stillwater's Company B veterans. Bloomer was also involved in veterans' affairs outside these two organizations. In 1905 he was given the honor of carrying the First Minnesota's battle flag from the old state capitol to the new. He also formed an organization which raised money and erected a soldier's monument on the grounds of the Washington County Courthouse in 1916. By 1915 Bloomer could barely walk and needed two canes to do so. He died on October 4, 1917, and was buried in Fairview Cemetery in Stillwater. An imposing monument of Bloomer as the First Minnesota's color bearer marks the site of his burial.

The operating system is Orbis OS, based on FreeBSD 9.  Technology =System= The native operating system of the PlayStation 4 is Orbis OS, which is a fork of FreeBSD version 9.0 which was released on January 12, 2012. The PlayStation 4 features two graphics APIs, a low-level API named Gnm and a high-level API named Gnmx. Most developers start with Gnmx, which wraps around Gnm, which in turn manages the more esoteric GPU details. This can be a familiar way to work if the developers are used to platforms like Direct3D 11. Another key area of the game is its programmable pixel shaders. Sony's own PlayStation Shader Language (PSSL) was introduced to the PlayStation 4. It has been suggested that the PlayStation Shader Language is very similar to the HLSL standard in DirectX 11, with just subtle differences that could be eliminated for the most part through preprocessor macros. Besides the kernel and related components, other components included and worth mentioning are Cairo, jQuery, Lua, Mono, OpenSSL, WebKit, and the Pixman rendering library. Many of these are open-source software, although the PlayStation 4 is not an open console. The Software Development Kit (SDK) is based on LLVM and Clang, which Sony has chosen due to its conformant C and C++ front-ends, C++11 support, compiler optimization and diagnostics. = Graphical shell = The PlayStation 4 uses the PlayStation Dynamic Menu as its graphical shell, in contrast to the XrossMediaBar (XMB) used by the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3, as well as the LiveArea used by the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation TV. It is named \\"Dynamic Menu\\" because the options it offers to players are context-sensitive, changing based on what a player is actually doing with their PlayStation 4 at any given time. This makes navigation simpler than the previous iteration. This dynamic menu can alter itself so that there's as little time as possible between the users placing a game in the disc drive and the actual gameplay beginning. The PlayStation 4's user interface attempts simplicity as a priority. The main place for entertainment options, the Content area, is prominently displayed with large square icons on a horizontal line arranged by the most recently used. Users can scroll through this gamer newsfeed in an alternating, brick- like formation reminiscent of the social media site Pinterest. Many other main objects will display additional information when having the cursor selected on them. A game may have news updates or advertisements for its downloadable content. Recently played games receive tiles along with a number of mandatory items like the Live from PlayStation and the Internet Browser applications. Content icon customization and options on how to sort them would give players a way to mold the display to better suit their needs. =Augmented Reality= The augmented reality application, the Playroom comes pre-installed with the PlayStation 4 console. It was demonstrated at E3 2013 and utilizes the Sony PlayStation Camera technology. According to Sony, it is a \\"fantastically fresh augmented reality entertainment experience\\", which has been created by combining the light bar located on the front of DualShock 4 controller with the PlayStation Camera. Players are allowed to produce a small floating robot called Asobi, who interacts with the players, scans their faces and shoots fireballs. Once the PlayStation Camera identifies the player with the help of the light bar on the front, a flick on the touchpad of the DualShock 4 controller brings up the augmented reality Bots function of the PlayRoom, which creates the illusion that there are hundreds of little bots inside the controller, which can be released simply with a tap on the track pad that functions like the PlayStation Vita. PS4 owners can view their smartphone or PlayStation Vita for drawing the object and flick it anywhere for the augmented reality Bots to play with. =Remote Play and second screen= Through Remote Play users can operate their PS4 through the uses of a PlayStation Vita handheld game console, allowing for the play of PS4 games and other media on the small device via streaming. All games that do not require the PlayStation Move or PlayStation Camera are compatible. The second screen can be used to display unique content when playing games that support this option, but it should not be confused with a split-screen. The second screen may be used to show extra content like maps, alternate camera angles, radar or even playbooks in sports games. Apart from PlayStation Vita, other mobile devices such as iPads or Android tablets can also be used as a second screen. That comes in the form of both the official PlayStation App and game companion apps such as Knack's Quest. =Social features= A heavy emphasis on social features has been placed on the PlayStation 4 console, loading up the PS4 with a number of share-centric apps and features. The [What's New] feature, which allows users to check out their friends' latest activities via a landing page full of their pictures, trophies and other recent events, is an easy way to find out what friends have been up to. On the other hand, a cross-chat feature dubbed [Party Chat] is an interesting way to keep in touch. This gives gamers the ability to chat with other users whether or not they're playing the same title. The PS4's sharing capabilities adds another layer to console gaming. PS4 owners are able to capture or livestream the gameplay with a simple button touch. They can record up to 60 minutes of their latest gaming exploits with a quick press of the Share button on the controller. Footage can be shared on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. They also have the ability to broadcast their gameplay in real-time to Twitch and Ustream in addition to recording videos. There are also other social features such as community creation. Some of them are introduced via system updates. Favorite Groups is a new section within the Friends app, and acts as a way to quickly access other people a user plays with the most. This feature is aimed at making it easier and faster to get into a game session with friends. On the other hand, communities are new hubs that can be formed around shared interests like games, activities, or play styles. There also exist other smaller social features on PS4, such as the ability to message a friend with a request to watch their gameplay live. =Internet features= While the PlayStation 4 console can function without an Internet connection, it provides more functionality when it is connected to the Internet. For example, updates to the system software may be downloaded from the Internet, and users may play online when the Internet is properly connected. Online play is the main pillar for the PlayStation 4, but a PlayStation Plus subscription is required to play the majority of PS4 titles online, unlike PlayStation 3 titles. According to Sony, they are developing many new ways to play and connect for PS4 which requires a large investment of resources. As a result, Sony claim they cannot keep such a service free and maintain its quality at the same time considering the cost, and they thus decided that it would be better to charge a fee in order to continue to offer a good service. The web browser included in the PlayStation 4 console is based on the open source WebKit layout engine, unlike the PlayStation 3 which uses the NetFront browser. Using the same modern Webkit core as Safari from Apple, the PS4 web browser receives a very high score in HTML5 compliance testing. However, just like other major browsers, it does not support the deprecated Adobe Flash, which means that websites which still require Flash might not display properly or function as intended. Also, the PDF format is not supported. However, one clear advantage for gamers is being able to cut between gaming and browsing and back again with no loss of gameplay due to the multitasking feature of the web browser. Additionally, while the PS4 web browser has limited support for USB keyboards, it does not seem to support USB mice at all. Furthermore, with Internet connection enabled the PlayStation 4 allows users to access a variety of PlayStation Network (PSN) services, including the PlayStation Store, PlayStation Plus subscription service, and more. Users may download or buy games and other content from these services. Also, gamers are able to play a selection of PS3 titles via the Internet-based PlayStation Now gaming service. =Multimedia features= The PlayStation 4 supports playing standard 12-centimeter DVD-Video discs; DVD recordable and rewritable discs except those that have not been finalized; and standard Blu- ray discs with the exception of Blu-ray Recordable Erasable version 1.0 discs and Blu-ray XL format discs. Unlike all previous PlayStation consoles the system does not support the Compact Disc format at all, including Compact Disc Digital Audio and Video CD format discs. Blu-ray 3D support was added in system software version 1.75. In 2015, Sony partnered with Spotify to bring the music streaming service to the PlayStation 4, allowing music to be streamed in the background of any game or application for both free and premium members of Spotify. The Media Player application included with the system can be used to play media files on USB storage devices or media servers. According to the PlayStation 4's user guide, media formats supported include videos contained in the MP4, MKV and AVI formats and encoded in H.264 AVC High Profile 4.2, MPEG4 ASP, MPEG2 Visual, AVCHD, and XAVC S; audio encoded in MP3, FLAC, or AAC; and photos encoded in JPEG, BMP, or PNG. The PlayStation 4 Pro also supports videos encoded in H.264 AVC High Profile 5.2. If users have a PlayStation VR headset connected, they can view 360-degree videos inside the headset. =Backward compatibility= The PlayStation 4 was not backward compatible with any games from previous PlayStation consoles at launch. Though PlayStation 4 users cannot play PlayStation 3 games directly, in 2014, the PlayStation Now cloud-based streaming service allowed for the streaming of selected PS3 games. In December 2015, Sony added PlayStation 2 backward compatibility and republished some PS2 games such as Dark Cloud and Grand Theft Auto III, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas on the PS4 via the PlayStation Store in the Americas and Europe. Supported PS2 games run via software emulation (upscaled to high definition) on PS4 systems instead of having been remastered. Each one has been updated to access various PS4 features, including Trophies, Share Play, Broadcasting, Remote Play and second-screen features. However, the original PS2 game discs, and PS2 Classics re-released for the PS3 are not compatible with the PS4 system. =Supported System Languages= Arabic, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English (United Kingdom), English (United States), French (Canada), French (France), Finnish, German, Greek, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Russian, Romanian, Spanish (Latin America), Spanish (Spain), Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Vietnamese.  History of updates  The initial version of the system software for the PlayStation 4 is 1.01 as pre- installed on the original consoles. Support for the Remote Play and second screen experiences were added in version 1.50, which was launched on the same day the PlayStation 4 console itself was released in North America on November 15, 2013. Both features are accessible from the PlayStation Vita console by using its PS4 Link application, and the second screen functionality is also accessible from smartphones and tablets through the PlayStation Mobile app. It is also able to record or share video clips as well as broadcasting gameplay to Twitch or Ustream. It supports Blu-ray and DVD-Video playback, and version 1.60 was released on February 4, 2014, improving DVD playback. Version 1.60 also adds support for Pulse Elite wireless headsets. Version 1.70 was released on April 30, 2014, and adds a number of new features, such as the addition of a rich video editor called ShareFactory that offers users the tools to combine, edit and personalize captured video clips. This update also adds the abilities to share video clips and screenshots while streaming, and to copy video clips and screenshots to USB storage. Version 1.75 was released on July 29, 2014, further adding the support for playback of Blu-ray 3D. It also improves the sound quality during 1.5-speed playback with Blu-ray and DVD video. Version 1.76 was released on September 2, 2014, came with minor changes and was the last update until version 2.0. Released on October 28, 2014, version 2.00 is a major upgrade to the PlayStation 4 system software. Among the features introduced is Share Play, which allows PlayStation Plus users to invite an online friend to join their play session via streaming, even if they do not own a copy of the game. Users can pass control of the game entirely to the remote user, or partake in cooperative multiplayer as if they were physically present.Andrew Kelly. Share Play in Action on PS4, blog.us.playstation.com, October 24, 2014.Isabelle Tomatis. PS4's Share Play feature in action, blog.eu.playstation.com, October 24, 2014. This version also adds a YouTube app and the ability to upload video clips to YouTube, and users can now play music stored on USB storage devices. Also, with the support for custom themes and the ability to change the background color, users can set themes for home screens and function screens for each user in this version. Version 2.50 was released on March 26, 2015, adding a suspend/resume feature to allow players to jump in and out of games with the PS button, and games are suspended in the low-power Rest Mode instead of closing completely. This version also allows the console's hard drive to be backed up or restored to a USB flash drive. On September 30, 2015, Sony released PS4 update 3.00. It introduced \\"entirely new features\\" and user-interface enhancements.

Patricia Carpenter She was born in Santa Rosa, California on January 21, 1923, and died on July 8, 2000 (Dineen, et al., 2000). She studied several instruments, primarily piano with Ethel Leginska, as well as percussion, bassoon, and conducting. She conducted the San Bernardino Symphony. Learning of Arnold Schoenberg from Leginska, she wrote asking him for lessons (correspondence is preserved in the Arnold Schoenberg Center in Vienna). From 1942 to 1949 she studied with Schoenberg, and in 1944 she gave the Los Angeles premiere of his Piano Concerto in the two-piano version. She was initially accepted into the composition program at Columbia University to study with Douglas Moore, and her compositions included several chamber and orchestra works. Under the supervision of Albert Hofstadter in philosophy and Paul Henry Lang in musicology, she embarked upon studies in the aesthetics and history of music. She completed her Ph.D. in Music and Philosophy at Columbia in 1972. The first woman to present a keynote address to the Society of Music Theory, she served as its Vice-President from 1992 to 1994.

In the 1880s, agricultural education in Minnesota was in trouble: farmers would not travel to the Twin Cities for classes, and university students did not want to study farming. Gregg, a successful dairy farmer from Lyon County, saved the day by bringing lectures directly to farmers. Beginning in 1885, he led the Minnesota Farmers' Institute, a public lecture series that became the agricultural extension service at the University of Minnesota. Through the institutes that he held across the state, Gregg encouraged farmers to diversify their crops and taught them how to make dairy farming more efficient. Early life Gregg was born in Enosburgh, Vermont in 1845. His father was a traveling minister, and his grandfather ran a highly regarded dairy farm. Gregg worked as a clerk, a schoolteacher, and a lay minister as a young man, before he settled on a homestead in Lyon County, Minnesota, in 1870. He and his wife, Charlotte, named the homestead Coteau Farm. They went into dairy farming, hoping to avoid problems such as soil depletion that can come with growing a single cash crop. At Coteau Farm, Gregg pioneered winter dairying. Minnesota dairy farmers had been at a disadvantage because of the state's climate. Without nutritious grass in the winter, cows stopped producing milk. Using knowledge from his grandfather, Gregg experimented to make winter dairying possible. He bred cows specifically for dairy, rather than beef, and he used a combination of grain, corn, and hay to keep his cows producing milk during the winter. Gregg and his wife developed high-quality butter known as \\"Solid Gold\\" that consistently won top prizes at local fairs. Gregg's success drew attention, and farmers began to visit Coteau Farm to learn about his methods. In the early 1880s, he was asked to begin speaking about his methods at dairy conventions and county fairs. At the same time, the agricultural education programs at the University of Minnesota were drawing fierce criticism. As a land-grant university, the school was required to teach agriculture. The Farmers' Alliance in Minnesota alleged that land grant funds were being misused and demanded a separate agricultural college. Other farmer organizations, like The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry (the Grange), were less militant but supported the position held by the Farmers' Alliance. In response, in 1885 University Regent and former Minnesota Governor John S. Pillsbury and Professor Edward D. Porter asked Gregg for help. Gregg proposed a series of lectures that would travel to farmers, rather than asking farmers to travel to the Twin Cities. The university's Board of Regents liked the idea. Minnesota Farmers' Institute Gregg was chosen to oversee the Minnesota Farmers' Institute lecture series in 1886. He held thirty-one institutes that year, speaking and hiring speakers. His first institutes were met with mixed reactions. In some towns, they had good attendance. In other towns, their attendance was low, farmers were hostile, or the lectures were actively boycotted. During the next few years, however, the institutes became more successful. In 1887, the Farmers' Institute secured state funding and Gregg was officially named superintendent. To draw crowds, Gregg asked his lecturers to speak off the cuff and to use demonstrations to create a spectacle. Some lectures drew crowds of up to 500 people. By 1899, even the Grange was an enthusiastic supporter of the institutes. Gregg chose lecturers who had practical farming experience, rather than \\"book farmers.\\" The institutes' main subjects were Gregg's own interests: crop diversification and winter dairying. Speakers also lectured on hog farming, sheep husbandry, and horse training. In 1890, Gregg added cooking institutes for farmers' wives. In the early 1900s, Gregg's institutes came under criticism once again. In the early years, his focus on practical farming skills rather than agricultural science was seen as a virtue. But after twenty years, many felt that farmers needed more advanced lessons. Further, there were many agricultural scientists at the University of Minnesota whose expertise was not being used. In 1907, the university's Board of Regents demanded that Gregg make changes to respond to these criticisms. Gregg refused and turned down another term as superintendent. He was replaced by Archie D. Wilson, who relied more on local speakers and agricultural scientists. Later life For the next seven years, Gregg lectured on agricultural topics in other states including North Dakota and Montana. He returned to Coteau Farm in 1914. In 1917, Gregg's friends in the state legislature secured a pension for him based on his early agricultural extension work. Gregg died in 1926.

The Society's constitution forbade any discussion of party politics or interference in elections.Stewart, p. 56. Their first meeting was held at Richmond's house in Portland Place.Crosby, pp. 132-133. Shortly after this a farmers' meeting took place in the Freemason's Tavern, London, at which the farmers decided to form a central office to coordinate the various local protectionist societies that had sprung up in the wake of the Anti-Corn Law League's agitation for repeal. There were 250 farmers present from nine counties as well as George Darby MP and William Miles MP, who were both representatives of the Central Agricultural Protection Society. During this meeting it was decided to merge this society with the Central Agricultural Protection Society.Crosby, p. 133. A committee of 22 delegates from the farmers' society was then sent to Portland Place, where Richmond, the Duke of Leeds and 40 or 50 other landlords were present. They discussed how the Society would be constituted. The Society was to have a president, vice- president, four trustees and a managing committee of 40 members (20 of whom must always be tenant farmers).

Immediately after his arrival he went to Canowie station, under instructions from the Hon. H. Scott, whom he saw before leaving England. Later he engaged in pastoral pursuits in the Port Lincoln district with his cousin (Mr. S. Goode), and subsequently entered into the service of Elder and Stuckey, in connection with stations in the Far North. In 1865 he went with Samuel Joseph Stuckey (born 21 March 1837) to India to bring back a consignment of camels and donkeys. He acted as supercargo on the return voyage and remained in charge of the herds until 1867, This was the first lot of camels ever brought to South Australia. In 1868 he settled at Saddleworth, and after some time farming and grazing commenced business as an auctioneer and agent. He remained at Saddleworth until he became a Government tenant in Bundaleer Forest Reserve. He was always interested in public affairs, and after acting at various times on the Saddleworth District Council, the Clare Licensing Bench, the Midland Road Board, the Saddleworth School Board, the Pastoral Board (under the Act of 1884), and the Central Land Board, he was elected as an Independent member of the House of Assembly for the district of Burra at the general election in 1896.

Charles Henry Goode (November 1868 ‚Äì 28 March 1940) was born at Saddleworth, South Australia, the eldest son of Charles Rufus Goode. He received some education there, but when his father moved to Canowie station around 1878, he was far more interested in cattle and horses. He spent some time with his uncle Thomas Goode. From 1889 to 1892 he worked for the Beltana Pastoral Company in the north of the State, camel driving and carting wool from as far as Cordillo Downs, near the Queensland border, and developed a reputation as a hard man. In 1892, he went south again and took up a block at Bundaleer. His father and the younger brothers were developing a nearby property. He was one of the founders of the Jamestown Racing Club; the family raced several horses, including the well-known Tostig, which was head of the father's stud, and Prince Edward, trained by Mr. W. Garnaut, which won five hurdle races in succession. He played football with the Jamestown team, and was a member of the Geebung Polo Club. Two of his hard-riding associates were Ben Hunt and Neil McLeod. He was an active member of the newly formed Jamestown Agricultural Society. A fine judge of bloodstock and shorthorns, his services were sought by various show societies. Around January 1897 he married Charlotte Marion Inglis (ca.1876 ‚Äì 17 July 1898) of Georgetown, a daughter of pastoralist George Inglis. She died at Canowie after giving birth on 9 July 1898 to a son who did not survive. He then enlisted with the Fifth Imperial Bushman's Contingent, commanded by Gen. F. Elliott. He spent the greater part of 1901 and 1902 in South Africa where he was involved in the battles of Grasspan and Groote Valley, then returned home to Bundaleer. He married Annie Florence Richardson on 23 September 1903. She was a sister of Arthur Richardson, a noted cricketer. They remained in the Bundaleer district until 1919, when they moved to Wandearah West. Their sons were Harold, who died in 1922, Lisle (some references have Lyall) (of Warooka), and Colin (of Wandearah West). Their daughters were Alice (Mrs. Rex Torr of Adelaide) and Kathleen, who married James F. \\"Jim\\" Stanley of Pirie East) in February 1932. Kathleen and Alice ran the Wandearah post office until 1928 and their mother ran it for the next 13 years.

It took place from 18 to 23 August 1945, and was the only major battle of the Soviet campaign in the Kuril Islands and one of the last battles of the war. Background The Soviet Union and Japan maintained a fairly scrupulous neutrality toward each other after signing the Soviet‚ÄìJapanese Neutrality Pact on 13 April 1941, although the two countries were allied with each other‚Ä≤s World War II enemies from 1941 until the conclusion of the war in 1945.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 3‚Äì4. The Soviet Union turned down Allied requests for any actions which might provoke Japan, but discussed plans to base American aircraft on Soviet territory for operations against Japan after the Soviet Union had declared war on Japan. Joseph Stalin said that the Soviet entry into the war against Japan would not be possible until after a three- month period following Germany's defeat,Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 4‚Äì8. per an assurance he offered to the United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union, W. Averell Harriman, at an October 1944 meeting. Stalin further stipulated as part of the agreement that it would include the Allies providing substantial assistance to the Soviet Union in building up its armed forces and military supplies in East Asia and the Pacific in advance of any Soviet operations against Japan. The United States soon began the work of meeting the Soviet requirements outside of and in addition to annual Lend-Lease allotments of aid to the Soviets,Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , p. 8. including the transfer of a dozen types of ships and aircraft from the United States to the Soviet armed forces. In the spring and summer of 1945, the United States secretly transferred 149 ships and craft - mostly escort vessels, landing craft, and minesweepers - to the Soviet Navy at Cold Bay in the Territory of Alaska in Project Hula. Even so, cooperation between the Soviets and Americans was minimal and in August 1945 the Soviets did not have the capability to mount a major sea-borne invasion of Japanese-held territory. As Stalin had promised, the Soviet Union declared war against Japan on 8 August 1945, exactly three months after the capitulation of Germany, and began an offensive against Japanese forces in Northeast Asia the next day. During August, Soviet forces attacked Japanese forces in the puppet state of Manchukuo in Manchuria, in the Japanese province of Karafuto on the southern half of Sakhalin Island, and the northern half of Korea, a Japanese possession at the time. Another Soviet goal during the offensive was the occupation of the Kuril Islands.http://www.rgo.ru/en/article/last-battle-world-war-ii-0 Preparations On 15 August 1945, the commander-in-chief of Soviet armed forces in the Soviet Far East, Marshal of the Soviet Union Aleksandr M. Vasilevsky, ordered the commander of the Soviet Armys Second Far Eastern Front, General Maksim A. Purkayev, and the commander of the Soviet Navys Pacific Ocean Fleet, Admiral Ivan S. Yumashev, to take the first step in the conquest of the Kuril Islands by occupying the islands of Shumshu and Paramushiro at the northern end of the archipelago, just off the southern tip of the Soviet Unions Kamchatka Peninsula. Soviet forces first were to take Shumshu, then Paramushiro; with these two islands under control, the rest of the island chain, which was only lightly held, would fall easily.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 29‚Äì33. Purkayev and Yumashev placed the commander of the Soviet Armys Kamchatka Defense Zone, General A. R. Gnechko, and the commander of the naval base at Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Captain 1st Rank Dmitri G. Ponomarev, in charge of the Shumshu operation, with Gnechko in overall command. Gnechko and Pomomarev had orders to assemble an assault force from forces locally available on the Kamchatka Peninsula and land on Shumshu within 48 hours. =Forces= The Imperial Japanese Army's 91st Division garrisoned both Shumshu and nearby Paramushiro, with about 8,500 troops on Shumshu and 15,000 more troops on Paramushiro. The garrisons were able to reinforce one another if necessary. The Japanese fielded 77 tanks. Against this force, Gnechko was able to field two reinforced Soviet Army rifle divisions and a Soviet Naval Infantry battalion with a combined total of 8,824 officers and men and a naval task force of 64 small ships and craft to carry them to Shumshu. The Soviets had no tanks and no major warships to commit to the operation, but enjoyed an advantage in artillery and mortars.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , p. 30. A Landsat 7 image of Shumshu. The northern tip of Paramushir (formerly Paramushiro) is at left. The First Kuril Strait lies across the upper portion of the image. =Planning= Gnechko and Ponomarev assessed the challenging schedule, concluding that the movement of a force over the from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky to Shumshu in the worlds foggiest waters would itself take 24 hours, leaving them only 24 hours to assemble an assault force if they were to meet the requirement to land on Shumshu by the evening of 17 August 1945 as ordered. Gnechko requested and received a 24-hour postponement, which moved the landing requirement to no later than the evening of 18 August 1945. Although Soviet intelligence reports indicated that the Japanese troops on Shumshu were demoralized by Japanese Emperor Hirohitos announcement on 15 August 1945 that Japan intended to surrender, Gnechko believed that the Japanese advantage in numbers could put the operation in jeopardy. Chronically poor weather in the area limited the ability of Soviet aircraft to conduct reconnaissance or provide support to a landing, but they were tasked to attack Paramushiros naval base to interdict Japanese reinforcements attempting to reach Shumshu.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 30‚Äì31. Gnechko also feared that his force lacked sufficient artillery and naval gunfire support for its initial landing. The ships of the landing force had few large guns - the largest of them, the minesweeper Okhotsk, had only one 130-mm (5.1-inch) and two 76.2-mm (3-inch) guns - and he doubted the Soviet Navys ability to provide enough gunfire support to counter Japanese coastal artillery; moreover he and Ponomarev doubted the ability of the small ships available to remain on station and provide effective shore bombardment while both under fire from Japanese coastal batteries and fighting strong currents in the First Kuril Strait. Gnechko planned to rely on four 130-mm (5.1-inch) guns on Cape Lopatka on the southern tip of the Kamchatka Peninsula to provide additional artillery support by firing 12 km (7.5 statute miles) across the First Kuril Strait against targets on Shumshu, but saw it as critical that Soviet infantry quickly establish a beachhead deep and secure enough to allow Soviet ships to unload artillery and mortars at Shumshu itself; he believed that only then would the Soviet advantage in artillery begin to express itself. However, the Soviet ground forces to be committed had little or no experience in amphibious warfare and little time for familiarization with Shumshu itself, and this, too, threatened the Soviet ability to establish the necessary beachhead. Gnechko hoped that by focusing the landing force in a concentrated attack on a small area, he could overcome these difficulties and establish a secure beachhead on which the Soviets could deploy artillery and mortars quickly. On the Japanese side, the 91st Infantry Division did not expect a Soviet attack. However, the Kurils had been a Japanese possession since 1875, and Japanese forces had garrisoned them throughout World War II, giving them great familiarity with the terrain. Nearby Paramushiro had been the major Japanese base in the North Pacific during the war, and Japanese coastal artillery was sited to defend against amphibious assaults on Shumshu. Japanese forces fighting the Soviets elsewhere in Northeast Asia had demonstrated an ability to put up a spirited defense, despite Japan's announced intention to surrender and the cessation of hostilities with the other Allies as of 15 August 1945. Landings The large infantry landing craft in May 1945, flying her colors at half-mast in honor of the recently deceased President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Transferred to the Soviet Navy at Cold Bay, Territory of Alaska, on 29 July 1945 in Project Hula, she became DS-48 and took part in the Soviet Invasion of the Kuril Islands, in which Japanese coastal artillery destroyed five of her sister ships during the 18 August 1945 Shumshu landings. The Soviet Union returned her to the United States in 1955.Russell, p. 19. The Soviet landing force left Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky at 0500 on 17 August 1945 and, after a 21-hour voyage, arrived in the First Kuril Strait at 0200 on 18 August 1945 and took up positions for the landings on Shumshu. The first wave of about 1,000 naval infantrymen went ashore at 0430 on 18 August 1945. Completely surprised, the Japanese mounted a disorganized defense, but the Soviets were unable to exploit this properly; inexperienced in amphibious landings, the naval infantrymen indulged in uncoordinated advances inland instead of focusing on the primary objective of establishing a secure beachhead of sufficient depth to bring artillery and mortars ashore. By 0530, the Japanese had manned machine guns in pillboxes and foxholes and begun to inflict heavy casualties on the Soviets. The Soviets also took too long to begin their assaults against Japanese coastal artillery positions, which the Japanese defended fiercely. At 0600, some Soviet units of the first wave finally attempted an attack on the Japanese batteries on Cape Kokutan, but were too outnumbered to breach the defenses. The Soviets held off a Japanese counterattack by infantry and 20 tanks, destroying 15 of the tanks, and then charged up the heights toward the artillery sites, but were repulsed near the top. Japanese coastal artillery soon found the range against Soviet ships. Almost completely lacking radio communication with the troops ashore, the Soviet ships attempts at naval gunfire support were ineffective. When the Soviet second wave headed for shore at 0530, led by 16 ex-U.S. Navy large infantry landing craft (LCI(L)s - now redesignated as desantiye suda) (DS, or \\"landing ship\\") - Japanese artillery laid down heavy fire against it. By the time it had finished unloading the second wave at 0900, Japanese artillery fire had destroyed five landing ships - DS-1 (ex-), DS-5 (ex-), DS-9 (ex-), DS-43 (ex-), and DS-47 (ex-). The Soviet second wave came ashore without its artillery and mortars and with few of its radios. At 0910, Soviet forces on Shumshu - badly in need of reinforcements and supplies - finally established radio contact with the ships offshore and with the four guns on Cape Lopatka. The gunfire from Cape Lopatka was particularly effective, and the Soviet troops held out against repeated Japanese counterattacks. By the afternoon, with the weather improving, Soviet aircraft began to attack the naval base on Paramushiro to prevent Japanese reinforcements from reaching Shumshu, and the Soviets had established good communications between their troops ashore, gunfire support ships, and Soviet aircraft, which combined to inflict heavy casualties on counterattacking Japanese. By the evening of 18 August 1945, the Soviets had established a beachhead 4 km (2.5 miles) wide and 5 to 6 km (3.1 to 3.75 miles) deep and had managed to bring artillery and mortars ashore.Russell, p. 31. Killed while silencing a Japanese machine-gun position on Shumshu on 18 August 1945, Soviet Naval Infantry Petty Officer First Class Nikolai Aleksandrovich Vilkov posthumously received the Hero of the Soviet Union award. Conclusion of the operation In a series of attacks during the night of 18‚Äì19 August 1945, the Soviets wiped out most of the defenses of the Japanese shore batteries, and Gnechko made plans to bring all Japanese resistance on Shumshu to an end on 19 August. Soviet heavy artillery came ashore on the morning of 19 August, and small groups of Japanese began to surrender. At 0900, a Japanese envoy informed the Soviets that the 91st Infantry Division had received orders from higher command to cease hostilities at 1600. Japanese forces on Shumshu, Paramushiro, and Onekotan signed an unconditional surrender agreement at 1800 on 19 August 1945. However, fighting on Shumshu continued to flare up until 23 August 1945, when the last Japanese on the island finally surrendered. Results The Battle of Shumshu was the only battle between the Soviets and Japanese in August‚ÄìSeptember 1945 in which Soviet casualties exceeded those of the Japanese. The Soviets suffered 1,567 casualties - 516 killed or missing and another 1,051 wounded - and the loss of five landing ships, while Japanese casualties totaled 1,018 - 256 killed and another 762 wounded. Soviet officers later often said that the operation demonstrated the difficulty of amphibious invasions of enemy territory and Soviet shortfalls and inexperience in amphibious warfare, and cited the Soviet experience on Shumshu as a reason for not invading the island of Hokkaido in the Japanese Home Islands.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet- American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , p. 32. With Shumshu and Paramushiro under Soviet control, the rest of the Kuril Island chain, much more lightly held by Japanese forces, fell to Soviet forces easily. The Soviets completed their occupation of the Kurils on 5 September 1945.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 33, 34.

Set-up Six contestants compete in each show. The studio is designed like a clock, with Rory at one end with his podium, which has 7 lights on it, and the six contestants are spread out on the other half with a small podium for each of them. Gameplay=Rounds 1 to 4= Before the show begins, lots are drawn to decide who goes first. That person then uses their buzzer on their podium to \\"stop\\" one of the lights in front of Rory's podium. Each of the 7 lights refers to a time between 30 seconds and 2 minutes, 30 seconds. The times are 30 seconds/45 seconds/1 minute/1 minute, 30 seconds/1 minute, 45 seconds/2 minutes/2 minutes, 30 seconds. This time refers to the length of time of each round. Once a time has been selected, the viewers at home see the time, but no-one in the studio, including Rory, knows what the time is until the time is up. The only hints that the contestants get is that after every 30 seconds, a noise is made in the studio. When the time is up, the lights in the studio flash and the contestant who is in play is removed from the game. The aim of the game is to try and build up as much money as possible, while trying to avoid being in control when the time is up. The more questions that you answer in a row, the more money they're worth. The first question is worth ¬£50, the second ¬£100, the third ¬£150, the fourth ¬£200, and the fifth and every subsequent question after that is worth ¬£300. After you get a question right, you get the choice of answering another question or pass it to another contestant by saying their name, but it can only be passed after Rory says that the answer is correct. When the clock runs out, Rory reveals what the time is and the person who passed the clock over to the eliminated person (known as \\"The Killer Pass\\") takes all the money that the eliminated person accrued and gets added to their own total. If the eliminated person has not been passed to, or has not had the chance to pass, then the money that they accrued is lost from the game. Passing to players who have accumulated a lot of money is generally regarded on the show as being a winning strategy, although it could actually backfire, as having more money usually means that a contestant is picked on more. This process is repeated for the next 3 rounds. The only difference is that the person who has the least money after each round picks the clock for the next round. If there is a tie, then it's the person who is on Rory's left who does the picking. =Face-off= Round 5 is known as the \\"Face-off\\". There are 2 players remaining, and the winner gets to play for all the money available in the final round. Both players get a clock that has 1 minute on it. The person who brought the least amount of money to this stage starts the \\"Face-Off\\". Once they get a question right, control is passed to the other contestant. This continues until the clock of one of the contestants has run out. =Final Round= The final round involves the remaining contestant trying to answer 5 questions correctly within 1 minute. The quicker they do it, the more money they get. If they don't do it in the time, then they leave with nothing. If the player answers gives 5 correct answers within 30 seconds, they receive the full amount of money. If they need another 10 seconds, the money is halved, and if they need another 10 seconds, the money is halved again, and if they need the final 10 seconds, the money is halved again. e.g. If the jackpot is ¬£1,850, then the contestant receives ¬£1,850 is they complete it between 0 and 29 seconds, they get ¬£925 if they complete it between 30 and 39 seconds, they get ¬£465 if they complete it between 40 and 49 seconds and they get ¬£235 if they complete it between 50 and 60 seconds. (Note: If the money halving doesn't give a round number, then the money is rounded up to the nearest ¬£5, e.g. if the money is ¬£1,225 and it's then halved, it drops not to ¬£612.50, but to ¬£615.)

Operation  At the most basic level, a floating dock is isolated from tidal water by a lock gate, at least, although in many dock systems the entrance is more complex than this.  Development and early docks = London = Howland's Wet Dock The first wet dock was Howland Great Wet Dock or Greenland Dock, built in London at the end of the 17th century. This was not a commercial dock and had no warehouses, but was intended solely for ship replenishment and refitting. = Liverpool (Old Dock) = In 1715 the first commercial wet dock, Liverpool's Old Dock, opened. Early docks were of simple construction: a single lock gate isolating them from the tidal water. The gates were opened during the last hour [or two] of the rising tide, giving a short window of opportunity to let ships in on the rise and releasing outgoing ships while the tide was on the turn. The gates were closed at top of tide to maintain levels within the dock. Although this short opening period may have seemed disruptive, any attempt at longer opening might allow dock water-level to fall with the ebbing tide thus interfering with the wharf-side level of every ship in the basin. A half tide dock is a partially tidal dock. They need have no gate, but as the tide ebbs a raised sill or weir on the floor of the dock prevents the level dropping below a certain point, meaning that the ships in the dock remain afloat, although they still fall with the first ebb of the tide. Half tide docks were only useful for ships of shallow draught, in areas with a large tidal range. The tide must rise sufficiently to give them a clear passage over the raised sill. = Hull = In 1775 Hull's Old Dock was opened. This was the first commercial floating dock, isolated by a lock rather than a single lock gate. This allowed the dock's water level to be maintained and, more importantly, it increased the time for which tidal access was possible. However the lock was only 121 ft long and this limited the number of ships passing through it. = Bristol = One of the first large fully floating docks was that of Bristol's Floating Harbour, built in 1809 to a plan by William Jessop. This involved the diversion of the River Avon (Bristol) away from its previous route through the harbour and into a new channel at the New Cut. Entrance to the harbour was now gained through an entrance basin, at what is now Cumberland Basin. Although linked by locks to the harbour and the river, the intention was that the basin would itself be used as an entrance lock: rather than locking each ship through one-by-one, ships could wait for the tide inside the basin and then the outer lock gates could both be opened allowing all to leave and arrive together. For a port with such a convoluted and tide-dependent approach as Bristol's, any easing of access was valuable. As the harbour now need never be connected directly to the tidal waters, its water level could be held constant, without even the small variation of the hours around high tide. At Bristol, Jessop controlled the height of the harbour water by a broad weir, built as a dam across the previous route of the river. Levels were maintained by the flow of the small River Frome which still flowed into the harbour. = Liverpool = Liverpool's floating Huskisson Dock, fronted by the Sandon Half Tide Dock As one of the first industrialised ports, Liverpool was at the forefront of dock development from the early 18th century. A network of inter-linked docks developed along the length of the River Mersey shoreline. These were floating docks, with access through a number of tidal basins and half tide docks. Ships could move through the interlinked docks 24 hours a day without moving into the tidal River Mersey, which would necessitate a pilot.  Impounding  Pumps within Wallasey Dock impounding station Floating docks are generally maintained at a level at least as high as the highest tide. Apart from any considerations of navigation, lock gates are usually arranged as a chevron. Where the dock is lower than the tide, other forms of lock gate must be used, such as caissons. and can only hold back higher water in one direction, which must always be from within the dock. A small but significant example of this is the locking system on the River Darent in Dartford, now in restoration and which were fully operational between 1899 and 1983. Maintaining this higher level requires a supply of water. In some cases this is available from a river flowing into the harbour. This was the case for Bristol, at least initially, with the River Frome. Where there was no such river source, a mechanical pumping station or 'impounding station' was constructed. Liverpool's northern docks were served by one at Huskisson Dock and one on the opposite side of the Mersey for Wallasey Dock. Bow Locks in East London has used a bi-directional system since the year 2000 permitting boats to transfer between the tidal Bow Creek and Limehouse Cut. Bow Locks permits transfer near top of tide whether it be neap or spring. Generally inbounds enter on the rise and outbounds on the fall. In practical use, the operation of Bow Locks is tightly controlled by the duty lock-keeper as every tide is different.

In equilibrium conditions (without mutational or selective pressure and with nucleotides randomly distributed within the genome) there is an equal frequency of the four DNA bases (adenine, guanine, thymine, and cytosine) on both single strands of a DNA molecule. However, in most bacteria (e.g. E. coli) and some archaea (e.g. Sulfolobus solfataricus), nucleotide compositions are asymmetric between the leading strand and the lagging strand: the leading strand contains more guanine (G) and thymine (T), whereas the lagging strand contains more adenine (A) and cytosine (C). This phenomenon is referred to as GC and AT skew. It is represented mathematically as follows: GC skew = (G ‚àí C)/(G + C) AT skew = (A ‚àí T)/(A + T) Asymmetric nucleotide composition Erwin Chargaff's work in 1950 demonstrated that, in DNA, the bases guanine and cytosine were found in equal abundance, and the bases adenine and thymine were found in equal abundance. However, there was no equality between the amount of one pair versus the other. Chargaff's finding is referred to as Chargaff's rule or parity rule 1. Three years later, Watson and Crick used this fact during their derivation of the structure of DNA, their double helix model. A natural result of parity rule 1, at the state of equilibrium, in which there is no mutation and/or selection biases in any of the two DNA strands, is that when there is an equal substitution rate, the complementary nucleotides on each strand have equal amounts of a given base and its complement. In other words, in each DNA strand the frequency of the occurrence of T is equal to A and the frequency of the occurrence of G is equal to C because the substitution rate is presumably equal. This phenomenon is referred to as parity rule 2. Hence, the second parity rule only exists when there is no mutation or substitution. Any deviation from parity rule 2 will result in asymmetric base composition that discriminates the leading strand‚Äìi.e., the DNA strand that is replicated in the forward direction‚Äìfrom the lagging strand. This asymmetry is referred to as GC or AT skew. In some bacterial genomes, there is an enrichment of guanine over cytosine and thymine over adenine on the leading strand and vice versa for the lagging strand. The nucleotide composition skew spectra ranges from ‚àí1, which corresponds to G = 0 or A = 0, to +1, which corresponds to T= 0 or C = 0. Therefore, positive GC skew represents richness of G over C and the negative GC skew represents richness of C over G. As a result, one expects to see a positive GC skew and negative AT skew in the leading strand, and a negative GC skew and a positive AT skew in the lagging strand. GC or AT skew changes sign at the boundaries of the two replichores, which correspond to DNA replication origin or terminus. Originally, this asymmetric nucleotide composition was explained as a different mechanism used in DNA replication between the leading strand and lagging strand. DNA replication is semi-conservative and an asymmetric process itself. This asymmetry is due to the formation of the replication fork and its division into nascent leading and lagging strands. The leading strand is synthesized continuously and in juxtapose to the leading strand; the lagging strand is replicated through short fragments of polynucleotide (Okazaki fragments) in a 5' to 3' direction. Calculation and GC skew plots There are three major approaches to calculate and graphically demonstrate GC skew and its properties. =GC asymmetry= The first approach is GC and AT asymmetry. Jean R. Lobry was the first to report, in 1996, the presence of compositional asymmetry in the genomes of three bacteria: E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Haemophilus influenzae. The original formulas at the time were not called skew, but rather deviation from [A] = [T] or [C] = [G]: deviation from [A] = [T] as (A ‚àí T)/(A + T); deviation from [C] = [G] as (C ‚àí G)/(C + G); where A, T, G, and C represent the frequency of occurrence of the equivalent base in a particular sequence in a defined length. A window sliding strategy is used to calculate deviation from C through the genome. In these plots, a positive deviation from C corresponds to lagging strand and negative deviation from C corresponds to leading strand.\\"Explanation of Lobry 1996 article\\" Furthermore, the site where the deviation sign switches corresponds to the origin or terminal. The x-axis represents the chromosome locations plotted 5‚Ä≤ to 3‚Ä≤ and y-axis represents the deviation value. The major weakness of this method is its window-size dependent property. Therefore, choosing an adequate window size greatly affects the outcome of the plot. Other techniques should be combined with deviation in order to identify and locate the origin of the DNA replication with greater accuracy. =CGC skew= The second approach is referred to as cumulative GC skew (CGC skew). This method still uses the sliding window strategy but it takes advantage of the sum of the adjacent windows from an arbitrary start. In this scheme, the entire genome is usually plotted 5' to 3' using an arbitrary start and arbitrary strand. In the cumulative GC skew plot, the peaks corresponds to the switch points (terminus or origin). In contrast to Lobry's earlier paper, recent implementations of GC skew flips the original definition, redefining it to be: GC skew = (G ‚àí C)/(G + C). With the flipped definition of GC skew, the maximum value of the cumulative skew corresponds to the terminal, and the minimum value corresponds to the origin of replication. =Z curve= The final approach is the Z curve. Unlike the previous methods, this method do not uses the sliding window strategy and is thought to perform better as to finding the origin of replication. In this method, each base's cumulative frequency with respect to the base at the beginning of the sequence is investigated. The Z curve uses a three-dimensional representation with the following parameters: x_{n} = (A_{n} + G_{n}) - (C_{n} + T_{n}) y_{n} = (A_{n} + C_{n}) - (G_{n} + T_{n}) z_{n} = (A_{n} + T_{n}) - (C_{n} + G_{n}) Where n = 0, 1, 2, ... N, x_{n} represents the excess of purine over pyrimidine, y_{n} denotes excess of keto over amino, and z_{n} shows the relationship between the weak and strong hydrogen bonds. x and y components can alone detect the replication origin and asymmetric composition of the strands. A combination of these methods should be used for prediction of replication origin and terminal, in order to compensate for their weakness. Mechanism There is lack of consensus in scientific community with regard to the mechanism underlying the bias in nucleotide composition within each DNA strand. There are two major schools of thought that explain the mechanism behind the strand specific nucleotide composition in bacteria. The first one describes a bias and an asymmetric mutational pressure on each DNA strand during replication and transcription. Due to the asymmetric nature of the replication process, an unequal mutational frequency and DNA repair efficiency during the replication process can introduce more mutations in one strand as compared to the other. Furthermore, the time used for replication between the two strands varies and may lead to asymmetric mutational pressure between leading and lagging strand. In addition to mutations during DNA replication, transcriptional mutations can create strand specific nucleotide composition skew. Deamination of cytosine and ultimately mutation of cytosine to thymine in one DNA strand can increase the relative number of guanine and thymine to cytosine and adenine. In most bacteria, the majority of the genes are encoded in the leading strand. For instance, the leading strand in Bacillus subtilis encodes 75% of the genes. In addition, an excess of deamination and conversion of cytosine to thymine in the coding strand compared to the non-coding strand has been reported. One possible explanation is that the non-transcribed strand (coding strand) is single- stranded during the transcription process; therefore, it is more vulnerable to deamination compared to the transcribed strand (non-coding strand). Another explanation is that the deamination repair activity during transcription does not occur on the coding strand. Only the transcribed strand benefits from these deamination repair events. The second school of thought describes the mechanism of GC and AT skew as resulting from a difference in selective pressure between the leading and lagging strands. Examination of the prokaryotic genome shows a preference in third codon position for G over C and T over A. This discrimination creates an asymmetric nucleotide composition, if the coding strand is unequally distributed between the leading and lagging strands, as in the case for bacteria. In addition, the highly transcribed genes, such as ribosomal proteins, have been shown to be located mostly on the leading strand in bacteria. Therefore, a bias in the third-position codon choice of G over C can lead to GC skew. Additionally, some signal sequences are rich in guanine and thymine, such as chi sequences, and these sequences might have a higher frequency of occurrence in one strand compared to the other. Both mutational and selective pressure can independently introduce asymmetry in DNA strands. However, the combination and cumulative effect of both mechanisms is the most plausible explanation for GC and AT skew. Uses The GC skew is proven to be useful as the indicator of the DNA leading strand, lagging strand, replication origin, and replication terminal. Most bacteria and archaea contain only one DNA replication origin. The GC skew is positive and negative in the leading strand and in the lagging strand respectively; therefore, it is expected to see a switch in GC skew sign just at the point of DNA replication origin and terminus. GC skew can also be used to study the strand biases and mechanism related to them by calculating the excess of one base over its complementary base in different milieus. Method such as GC skew, CGC skew, and Z curve are tools that can provide opportunity to better investigate the mechanism of DNA replication in different organisms. References * Mewes, H. W. et al.

They are officially named after late Congressman Tom Lantos, who was instrumental in securing funding for the project, but de facto named after their location. The Devil's Slide tunnels, as they are usually called, are the second and third longest road tunnels in California at northbound, and southbound. By comparison the longest road tunnel currently in California, the Wawona Tunnel on Highway 41 in Yosemite National Park, is . History of the highway rebuilding conflict A bypass was proposed to be constructed to replace the stretch of highway. Beginning in 1958, California began the process to replace Devil's Slide with an inland route over Montara Mountain, known as the Martini Creek Bypass. The bypass bisected a section of McNee Ranch State Park, and was opposed by community and environmental groups. By 1975, 55% of the right-of-way had been acquired, when work on the proposed bypass was abandoned due to public opposition. Most environmentalists supported a tunnel as a more environmentally sensitive alternative to the Martini Creek Bypass. A short tunnel built in 1908 by the Ocean Shore Railroad went through the area, but was destroyed during Prohibition, to keep it from being used by alcohol smugglers. The Sierra Club proposed building a tunnel to bypass the road in 1973. A Caltrans study in 1974 determined that a tunnel would be a viable alternative to the current road or a proposed inland freeway bypass. However, the state dropped the idea in the late 1970s. Devil's slide rockfall, which closed Route 1 for 5 months A major slide in 1983 brought the problem to the public attention again. In 1985 Caltrans proposed the Martini Creek bypass as the preferred solution. However, the Sierra Club sued to stop construction, as California law requires that State Route 1 be restricted to two lanes in rural areas. The road bed, complete with continuous uphill passing lanes, runaway truck ramps, and extra-wide shoulders, would be the widest two-lane road in the state. Again the state decided to return to the status quo. Aerial view of tunnel under construction as a bypass at Devil's Slide A five-month outage caused by a slide in January 1995 again brought public scrutiny to the stretch of highway. In April, Caltrans documents were discovered that showed the agency had intentionally overestimated the costs of a tunnel, to support the freeway bypass. In July, the Federal Highway Administration ordered Caltrans to re-evaluate a tunnel to bypass Devil's Slide. On November 5, 1996, San Mateo County voters approved Measure T by 76%, changing the county's stated preference from construction of the bypass to construction of a tunnel. On November 9, Caltrans changed its position, supporting a bridge and tunnel as the best environmental, economic, and popular alternative to Devil's Slide. Ground was broken for the new tunnel on May 6, 2005. Boring of twin diameter tunnels started September 17, 2007, and was completed in 2011. Breakthrough on the northern bore occurred on September 30, 2010. With the completion of the tunnels in 2013, the old Devil's Slide highway was converted into a trail for hikers and bicyclists. The tunnels opened to traffic on March 26, 2013.

Among its most distinctive features was its prominent false front, which was produced by the construction of a tall parapet on the front and its embellishment with brackets and a cornice. The effect of a traditional country store was enhanced by the presence around the entrance of a porch with a shed roof. Throughout its history, the display windows and double doors at and around the entrance were never replaced. While numerous other commercial buildings exist in Mechanicsburg, such as in the downtown commercial district, they are generally substantially different from Hamer's because of their brick construction and Italianate styling. Historic site Site of the general store In 1985, Hamer's General Store was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying as a rare surviving example of late-nineteenth- century commercial architecture. It was part of a multiple property submission of approximately twenty buildings, scattered throughout the village in such a low concentration that a historic district designation was not practical. Despite this designation, Hamer's is no longer standing; a Valero gas station occupies the site where the store was once located.Photograph at left.

A. & W. Goode was one of the largest regional department stores in the early days of South Australia, with stores in Yankalilla, Aldinga, Willunga, then finally and most notably in Port Pirie. Its principals were three brothers, Henry Abel Goode, William Goode and Benjamin Powell Goode, all born at Kyre Magna, in Worcestershire, sons of farmer William Goode. The Goodes who emigrated from Kyre Magna (also called Kyre Wyard, and now just inside Herefordshire)http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42897 were: Thomas Goode of Canowie Station, Henry Abel Goode, William and Benjamin Powell Goode on the Hope in 1858, Charles Rufus Goode (of Port Pirie) on the Princess Helena in 1860, and Matthew Goode (of Willunga) on the South Australian in 1868. Also on the South Australian was their sister Ann. Another brother, Samuel (d.1878) and a sister Elizabeth (c. 1837 ‚Äì 1912) remained behind. Elizabeth married Alfred John Prince Porter, a master tailor, moved with him and her brother Samuel, also a tailor, to Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England, and had ten children. Her second child Alfred John Porter joined the Goodes in Australia in about 1883. The youngest, Eva, married one David Herbertson: their descendants subsequently moved to Australia. Matthew Goode (c. 1820‚Äì1901) of Matthew Goode and Co, Thomas Goode (1816‚Äì1882) of Goolwa, and Sir Charles Henry Goode were cousins. Matthew Goode married a Miss Jones before leaving England. She died, and Matthew married her sister Elisabeth Jones ( ‚Äì 19 May 1902) in 1853. Three other sisters married the three principals of H. A. and W. Goode: Frances (c. 1845 ‚Äì 1 February 1930) married Benjamin Powell Goode on 19 June 1867; Emily Georgeanna Jones (October 1845 ‚Äì 17 October 1932) married Henry Abel Goode on 19 August 1868 and Marion Jones (c. 1853‚Äì1929) married William Goode in 1873. The Jones sisters were daughters of Edward Jones (c. 1792 ‚Äì 29 January 1880) of Haywood, Herefordshire, later of Finniss Point, South Australia then Hutt Street, Adelaide. History Three brothers, Thomas, Henry, and Benjamin arrived in South Australia in 1858, after a voyage of 122 days in the sailing vessel Hope. William found employment in the wholesale and retail drapery business Goode Bros., on Rundle Street (where Charles Birks & Co. later stood), owned by his cousins Matthew and Charles Henry Goode. The wholesale business moved to Stephens Place, and later became Matthew Goode and Co. William and his brother Henry were with the firm for six years. On leaving his cousin's employ William and Henry bought general stores at Aldinga and Yankalilla, (licences granted in 1879) employing their brother Benjamin to manage for them at Yankalilla. Business boomed and Benjamin was admitted to the partnership. A second shop was bought in Aldinga, and one at Willunga, and the four establishments returned a profit. In 1878 the partners bought out Brown, Wood, & Scrutton, who ran a small store in Port Pirie, and improved the business year by year until it assumed large proportions. In 1896 they sold the southern businesses and in 1905 the replacement two storey store, one of the architectural features of Ellen Street, was completed. The premises occupied a frontage of nearly 80 ft. by a depth of 95 ft. In 1909 they sold the business to Mrs. Robert Knox and William Miller, of Wilcannia, but it carried on as \\"H. A. & W. Goode\\" (later \\"Goode Brothers\\"), and was one of the largest concerns outside Adelaide. In 1914 a limited liability company was formed to run the business, with Knox and Lance Goode as directors and W. E. Wainwright as Chairman. In 1916 the business again changed hands, with J. B. Johnston, H. W. Goode, and Mrs. Frances Goode as the new proprietors. Mrs. Goode died in 1930, and in 1932 the business was purchased by the family of H. A. Goode, with Lance Goode as managing partner. Its trading name reverted to the original \\"H. A. & W. Goode\\". In 1923 the store's magazine was forced open and some gelignite stolen. A subsequent attempt to blast open the strongroom failed, but the ensuing fire created a great deal of damage. No-one was ever charged with the offences. Henry Abel Goode Henry Abel Goode (1838 ‚Äì 12 February 1921) was born at Kyre Magna, Worcestershire, in 1838. He embarked for South Australia by the sailing vessel Hope in 1857, and reached Port Adelaide after a voyage lasting 152 days. Six years later, with his brother, William Goode, he founded the firm of H. A. & W. Goode, in which, subsequently, their brother Benjamin P. Goode, of Port Pirie, became a partner. The business, which was conducted at Aldinga and Port Pirie, grew to large dimensions. In 1909 Mr. Goode relinquished his connection with the firm, and lived in retirement. During his business life he did a considerable amount of stock valuing, and was recognised in commercial circles as an expert. =Family= Henry Abel Goode married Emily Georgina Jones (October 1845 ‚Äì 17 October 1932), a daughter of Edward Jones, of Finniss Point, on 19 August 1868.

He took a leading role in the advancement of the town: securing the railway link to Broken Hill via Silverton and Petersburg which succeeded, at least in part, by wooing Sir John Colton and his \\"Big Ministry\\" which included Sir Jenkin Coles, C.

Patten visited Port Pirie to evaluate the country on behalf of the British Broken Hill Company they were in a position to guarantee them a suitable site. *He was a big shareholder in a syndicate which bored for coal in the Crystal Brook Creek. They found nothing, and abandoned the search when the drill broke. *He was largely instrumental in the opening up of flux quarries in the district. *He was active in the Port Pirie Agricultural, Horticultural, and Floricultural Society, and the Piscatorial Society, of which he was for some time president. *He helped promote the Port Pirie branch of the District Trained Nursing Society, of which he was treasurer. *He was an active member of the vigilance committee, and the Pioneers' Association. *He was a trustee of the Methodist Church, and supported foundation of a local corps of the Salvation Army in 1883. *He was patron of the Port Pirie Rowing Club. *He was appointed to the School Board of Advice for Port Pirie in 1879. *He was appointed Justice of the Peace sometime before 1878. =Character= William Goode, in an obituary in the Port Pirie Recorder was described as the finest natural orator the editor had known, a man of great tenacity and steadfastness of purpose; not an analytical thinker but a fine organiser and generous friend, an imposing figure with \\"towering forehead, craggy brows, and deep-set, piercing grey eyes ... determined mouth and square jaw ... at social gatherings he always seemed to say the right thing and in the happiest words ... he had a fine sense of the fitness of things, and frequently saved an awkward situation ... Mr. Goode's hostility and implacability in the contentious field of politics was to some hard to reconcile with his nobility of character socially and privately. ... It will be years ere we shall look on his like again\\". =Family= William Goode married Marion Jones (c. 1853‚Äì1929). Their children included: *William Ernest Goode (1874‚Äì ), of \\"Konetta\\" Wandearah, :Not to be confused with William Edward Goode (c. 1857‚Äì1929) of White's River station, husband of Mrs. A. K.

He next worked at Mount Barker then to Goolwa. In 1866 he was appointed to control his brothers' shop at Yankalilla, which had just been purchased from Messrs. Allen and Jones, of Aldinga. Three years later he was admitted as a member of the firm, but did not move to Port Pirie until 1880. Unlike his brother William, he did not readily take to public utterances, though on occasion he proved himself a forceful and effective speaker. Like his brothers, he was a large man and had a powerful baritone voice, leading the Pirie Methodist Church choir for 14 years. He was several times elected as auditor for the Town Council, but otherwise had a low public profile. He was one of the founders of the Port Pirie Institute, and was made a life member.

Life Diacceto was born in Florence on 16 November 1466, the son of Zanobi Cattani da Diacceto and Lionarda di Francesco di Iacopo Venturi. In his nineteenth year he married Lucretia di Cappone di Bartolomeo Capponi, with whom he had seven sons and six daughters. From 1491 to 1492 he studied philosophy under Oliviero Arduini at the University of Pisa. When he returned to Florence he became a disciple of Marsilio Ficino and a member of the intellectual group known as the Platonic Academy. He is sometimes considered Ficino's successor. Unlike Ficino, Diacceto tried to reconcile the philosophies of Aristotle and Plato. Also, he was not concerned with trying to Christianise Plato or Plotinus, so he provides a much clearer account of Neoplatonic magic and astrology; however, he appears to have been less interested in the subject than Ficino. Diacceto died in Florence on 10 April 1522. Works The works of Diacceto, in the original Latin, are collected in the 1563 edition, Opera Omnia, edited by Theodor Zwinger and published in Basel. De Pulchro, which is based on Plotinus, contains Diacceto's Neoplatonic theory of magical and astrological effects, in a chapter entitled: \\"The twofold soul, first and second, and its cognition likewise twofold, from which derives the appetite for beauty, and natural Magic: the nature of which he shows and which he differentiates from superstitious magic.\\" ReferencesFurther reading *Armand L.

History Historically, Aeolus was the Greek ruler of the winds, and the Ancient Greeks believed these sounds were the voice of Aeolus. The earliest known observations about Aeolian sounds from a \\"scientific\\" viewpoint were made by Athanasius Kircher in 1650. Physical cause An Aeolian tone is produced when air passes over an obstacle, resulting in trailing vortices with oscillatory behavior. These eddies can have strong periodic components, resulting in a steady tone. This phenomenon is the main topic of aeroacoustics; For air moving over a cylinder, empirical data shows that an Aeolian tone will be produced with the frequency : f_{\\\\text{Aeolian}}\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{St} \\\\cdot V}{D}, where V is the air velocity, D is the diameter of the cylinder, and \\\\mbox{St} is the Strouhal number, which has a value of about 0.2. Notable occurrences Aeolian sounds can be produced in the rigging of a sail-powered ship. The vortex trails produced as the wind passes over a rope produce a sound with a frequency that varies with the velocity of the wind and the thickness of the rope. Each doubling of the wind velocity results in an octave increase in the tone, allowing up to a six octave variation in a strong, gusty wind. Ships may also carry Helmholtz resonators that amplify these sounds. Aeolian sounds can also be heard among the openings in limestone cliffs. Some songs have been written to emulate these varying wind sounds, such as \\"The Winter Wind\\" by Fr√©d√©ric Chopin or \\"Tempest\\" by Ludwig van Beethoven. Aeolean sound was heard around San Francisco on Friday, June 5, 2020 as a consequence of high winds and new walkway slats on the Golden Gate Bridge https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Golden-Gate-Bridge-noise-humming-why- wind-sound-15321767.php See also *Aeolian harp References Wind power Sound ","title":"Aeolian sound"},{"id":"38633254","text":"Fairwood is the name of some places in the U.S. state of Washington: *Fairwood, King County, Washington *Fairwood, Spokane County, Washington ","title":"Fairwood, Washington"},{"id":"38633279","text":"Harold Clark may refer to: *Gene Clark (Harold Eugene Clark, 1944‚Äì1991), American singer-songwriter * Harold L.

From 1929 through 1940, he owned several Minor League Baseball teams, as well as the Negro league Baltimore Black Sox. He is best known, however, for his work as a scout for Major League Baseball, especially for his work in Cuba. From the mid-1930s until his death in 1962, he recruited hundreds of Cuban players for the Washington Senators and Minnesota Twins. Cambria was described as \\"the first of many scouts who searched Latin America for inexpensive recruits for their respective ball clubs.\\" Early life Cambria was born in Messina, Italy on July 5, 1890. In 1893 he and his two older brothers were brought to the United States by his father; his mother did not make the trip and may have died in Italy. They settled in Boston, where Cambria attended public schools. He played professional baseball as an outfielder for the Newport team of the independent Rhode Island League in 1909‚Äì1910 and for the minor league Berlin Green Sox of the Canadian League in 1911‚Äì12. His career as a baseball player ended after he broke his leg, and he returned to Massachusetts, worked in Boston and Lowell, and married Charlotte Kane. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1916 and served in the military during World War I. Baltimore After his military service, Cambria moved to Baltimore where he eventually owned a laundry business, the Bugle Coat and Apron Company. In 1928, his company sponsored an amateur baseball team known as the Bugles and the following year he converted it to a semi-professional team. He purchased and renovated a ballpark, which he renamed Bugle Field, for the team. In December 1929, he purchased a minor league team, the Hagerstown Hubs of the Blue Ridge League. In 1931, the team moved to the Middle Atlantic League and, in mid- season, moved first to Parkersburg, West Virginia, then to Youngstown, Ohio. In 1932, the team played as the Youngstown Buckeyes in the Central League, after which he sold the team. In 1932, Cambria became co-owner (with George Rossiter) and general manager of the Baltimore Black Sox, a Negro league team. He renovated and expanded Bugle Field, adding lighting equipment for night games, and made it the home park for the Black Sox. The team was in first place in the East-West League in late June when the league disbanded and the teams stopped paying player salaries, instead splitting a percentage of the gate receipts with the players. In 1933 the Black Sox played in the new Negro National League. Cambria's team faced competition from two other Baltimore- based Negro league teams‚ÄîBen Taylor headed the Baltimore Stars, and J. B. Hairstone headed an independent team called the \\"Black Sox\\" that obtained an injunction forcing Cambria to temporarily rename his team as the \\"Sox.\\" In 1934, Cambria applied to reenter the Negro National League, but when several star players announced they would leave the team his application was rejected, and he disbanded the team. In 1933, Cambria purchased the Albany Senators of the International League. He sold many players to major league clubs, and established a close working relationship with Clark Griffith, owner of the Washington Senators. In 1934 he signed Cuban Bobby Estalella, the first of many Cuban players he would scout and recruit. In 1936 he sold the Albany Senators to the New York Giants, who moved the franchise to Jersey City, New Jersey. From 1937 through 1940, Cambria also owned the Salisbury Indians of the Eastern Shore League. Their 1937 season featured one of the most remarkable comebacks in the history of baseball. After opening the season with a 21‚Äì5 record, the league president ruled that the team had carried one more \\"experienced\\" player than the four experienced players allowed by the league rules, and declared all of their victories to be forfeits, resetting their record to 0‚Äì26. The fifth experienced player had signed a minor league contract three years earlier, but had never actually played professionally. Cambria appealed the decision to the president of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, but to no avail. But the team continued to play very well and eventually retook the lead, going 59‚Äì11 over the remainder of the season. The best pitcher, Joe Kohlman, pitched a no-hitter to clinch the pennant and a second no-hitter two weeks later to win the deciding game of the league playoffs. Cambria invested in other minor league teams. In 1935 he bought the Harrisburg Senators of the New York‚ÄìPennsylvania League. After one season, the ballpark was flooded and he moved the team first to York, Pennsylvania, then to Trenton, New Jersey halfway through the 1936 season. In 1938 the New York‚ÄìPennsylvania League was renamed as the Eastern League, and in 1939 the Trenton Senators moved to Springfield, Massachusetts as the Springfield Nationals. In 1938 he owned the St. Augustine Saints of the Florida State League, from 1939 to 1940 he owned the Greenville Spinners of the South Atlantic League, and in 1940 he owned the Newport Canners of the Appalachian League. After the 1940 season, Landis ruled that a major league scout could not own a minor league team, so Cambria sold his minor league interests to work as a full-time scout for the Washington Senators. Cuba Cambria made his first trip to Cuba in the spring of 1936 and signed nine Cuban players for the Albany Senators. After the early 1940s, Cambria usually resided in Havana most of the year. He signed many other Cuban players who eventually made it to the major leagues, including Sandy Consuegra, Bobby Estalella, Willy Miranda, Mike Fornieles, Connie Marrero, Tony Oliva, Camilo Pascual, Pedro Ramos, and Zoilo Versalles. He also signed players from other Latin American countries, including Alex Carrasquel, the first player from Venezuela. Cambria developed a system of \\"bird dog\\" scouts, including Merito Acosta, who would scout the provinces for young baseball players who had not yet made their way to Havana. He also invested in the neighborhood around Gran Stadium, buying bars, rental properties, and a small restaurant behind the center-field scoreboard. In 1946, Cambria was one of three investors who owned the Havana Cubans, a franchise in the new minor league Florida International League. Griffith soon purchased a 50-percent interest and turned the Cubans into a Senators farm team. The attendance during the team's first season, 197,389, was nearly double the old attendance record for a Class C minor league team. During each of its first five seasons, the team had the best record in the Florida International League, though it won the playoffs only twice, in 1947 and 1948. When the Senators relocated to Minnesota in 1961 and became the Minnesota Twins, Cambria remained with the team. In March 1962, Cambria became very ill and was flown from Havana to Minneapolis for treatment. He died at St. Barnabas Hospital in Minneapolis on September 24, 1962.

Children of Juan Bautista and Maria Dolores * Francisco Agustin * Juan Bautista Trading career=Ute Missions= In February 1850, James S. Calhoun, Indian Agent, and later first Territorial Governor of New Mexico, granted Lacome a license to trade with the Ute nation so long as he did not trade lead, weapons, or other war items. Based on the recommendation of Manuel Alvarez and William S. Messery, Calhoun charged Lacome to search for survivors of the White Massacre and ascertain whether they could be ransomed. Lacome met with peaceful chiefs of the Ute Nation who reaffirmed their peaceful relations with the United States. They confirmed that the child had been taken by a band of Jicarilla Apache and killed shortly after Grier and Carson's attack on their camp with her body thrown in a river. The servant was killed a short time later, being unable to keep up with the band. He returned his report a few weeks later on March 16, 1850. Based on a rumor that the child was still alive, Calhoun charged Lacome to follow up his previous mission in July 1850. He traveled with an interpreter and two peons and met up with the Muache band of the Ute. About forty warriors came to meet him, taking his rifle, and divided his trade goods among themselves, valued at about $690 in goods, one horse, and one mule. This band stated they wanted no peace with the United States.Calhoun, James S., collected and edited by Annie Heloise Abel, \\"The Official Correspondence of James S Calhoun While Indian Agent at Santa F√© and Superintendent of Indian Affairs in New Mexico\\", 1915 Washington Government Printing Office, pp. 168-170 Further, the band had resolved to kill the party with the exception of one of the peons, who was to be allowed to live to inform the governor of their actions. An arrow was shot at Lacome but the interpreter jarred the Ute who held the bow and it missed its mark. After much negotiation the Utes consigned to only give a severe whipping to the interpreter and a peon. Lacome's rifle was returned to him, being too heavy for their use, along with four of his worn out mules, two oxen and two cows. At the same time as this second mission, an incident at the mercantile at Rio Colorado had a band of Utes arriving with local Mexicans as hostages to intimidate illegal trade.Colorado Magazine, Vol 34, No 4, pg 285 Lacome returned to Rio Colorado after his encounter with the Muache band and, based on these incidents, presented a petition on behalf of citizens of Taos County to Calhoun for a campaign against the Apache. Kit Carson was also a signer of the petition.Calhoun, James S., collected and edited by Annie Heloise Abel, \\"The Official Correspondence of James S Calhoun While Indian Agent at Santa F√© and Superintendent of Indian Affairs in New Mexico\\", 1915 Washington Government Printing Office, pp. 178 These rising conflicts foreshadowed the Jicarilla War. =Other documented trading= In 1852, Lacome took trade items, including knives, tobacco, coffee, lead, sugar, and other goods, loaded on mules to trade with the Navajo at Ca√±on de Chelly. He returned a month later.Wheat, Joe. \\"Blanket Weaving in the Southwest\\", 2003 University of Arizona Press, pg 75 Trading license records specify that he traded with the Navajo at the Canyon de Chelly and that he traded with other Pueblos in addition to the Zuni. They also indicate he lived in San Luis, Colorado and Rio Colorado, New Mexico and traded as far as Wyoming and Nebraska. The Spiegelberg Brothers are listed on several of his licenses as providing the surety bonds required by the territorial government for trade with the Native Americans. Abraham Staab, a prominent Jewish donor for the Cathedral in Santa Fe, is also listed. A letter in French to Manuel √Ålvarez, a fellow trader and lieutenant-governor of New Mexico, notes their friendship and business dealings. The 1860 census of Taos/Arroyo Hondo lists his occupation as a merchant with real estate valued at $2000 and personal property at $8000 (approximately $55,500 and $225,000 respectively in 2013 dollars).1860 Federal Census Taos County, New Mexico Territory (File 23 of 32) A Pueblo Chieftain article dated June 8, 1872 lists Lacome's mercantile as one of three stores in San Luis in addition to a blacksmith, butcher, beer saloon, carpenter, and two hotels. =Hawken rifle= Fullstock Replica of Lacome Rifle Lacome's .58 caliber percussion lock prairie rifle is displayed in the Palace of the Governors museum in Santa Fe, where he is listed as a trader with the Zuni and Navajo.

The .58 caliber untapered barrel is 36\\" x 1-1/8\\" and the rifle is approximately 53\\" in overall length with a 13-5/8\\" length of pull. The rifle was originally a fullstock, but was either damaged and repaired or intentionally cut down to a halfstock length.

Their work is usually performative or sculptural, often incorporating audience participation and interaction with the artists.  About  Industry of the Ordinary document their projects at their website, where their manifesto states, \\"Through sculpture, text, photography, video, sound and performance, Industry of the Ordinary are dedicated to an exploration and celebration of the customary, the everyday, and the usual. Their emphasis is on challenging pejorative notions of the ordinary and, in doing so, moving beyond the quotidian.\\" Industry of the Ordinary formed in 2003. IOTO's work appears in diverse forms, including performances tailored for specific exhibitions and performance art openings, artist-driven interventions on the streets of cities throughout the US and internationally, and public works commissioned by the Nebraska State Historical Society, the City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (DCASE) and the Billboard Art Project, among others. They have shown work at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, the Chicago Cultural Center, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Hyde Park Art Center, and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.  Themes  Industry of the Ordinary's work deals with themes of faith, freedom, politics, youth culture, celebrity, competitive sports, sex and drinking. They often employ collaborative strategies, as in their piece 39 Verbs, for which they commissioned fellow arts professionals to create 39 works inspired by arbitrarily assigned verbs taken from their previous works' titles. This emphasis on collaboration subverts traditional conceptions of art creation as highly individualistic, calling into question the elitism of the institutional art world. Works like Celebrity and the Peculiar, an installation of oxygen tents suffused by humidifiers with various celebrity perfumes, question popular culture's obsession with notoriety and our individual attempts to identify with celebrities. IOTO's preoccupation with public interaction and stated intention that their work be completed by the creative interpretation and engagement of the audience has led some critics to categorize their work within the umbrella of Relational Aesthetics. Their work has also been linked to the Situationist International and Fluxus movements. Their public interventions, usually ephemeral and existing afterwards only in the form of documentary photographs, videos, or text, has also been compared to the Happenings of the 1960s. One piece, Re-Work (for Allan Kaprow, Marina Abramoviƒá and Philip-Lorca diCorcia), re-imagines Allan Kaprow's delegated performance, Work. In his original, Kaprow hired professional house painters to paint and re-paint the hallway of a gallery space. For their Re-Work at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, IOTO hired two sex workers to perform the same task while wearing their \\"professional\\" attire. Just as Kaprow's piece questioned the distinction of artist by contracting out the actual art- making process, IOTO's piece questions our assumptions about the nature of, and our subsequent judgements of, certain types of labor.  Sic Transit Gloria Mundi  Industry of the Ordinary's mid-career retrospective, Sic Transit Gloria Mundi, was shown at the Chicago Cultural Center from August 2012 to February 2013. It was an exhibition of many of their works to that point, as well as several new pieces and a series of commissioned performances and installations which occurred throughout the run of the show. One of the elements of the show, the Portrait Project, consisted of 71 portraits of Industry of the Ordinary, commissioned from 71 different artists in various media. Another piece, Everyone, was a projected, scrolling, crowd-sourced list attempting to name every professional artist in Chicago.

Staff Report No. 458. Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Reports A common and prominent feature of many ABCP programs is that they were created by banks to fund bank assets in an off-balance sheet way, possibly to avoid regulatory capital requirements. Due to this character, ABCP programs are cited as one of the reasons for the Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. In terms of terminology, ABCP usually refers to asset-backed commercial paper, while ABCP conduit (or conduit) the program. The maturities of ABCP range up to 270 days but average about 30 days.Board of Governors of Federal Reserve System. http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/cp/about.htm. History ABCP programs first appeared in the mid-1980s. Initially, ABCP conduits were primarily sponsored by major commercial banks as a means of providing trade receivable financing to their corporate customers. Over the past decade, ABCP programs have grown to serve a wide variety of needs such as: asset-based financing for companies that cannot access the commercial paper market, warehousing assets prior to security issuance, investing in rated securities for arbitrage profit, providing leverage to mutual funds, and off-balance sheet funding of bank assets.The Fundamentals of Asset-Backed Commercial Paper. Structured Finance Special Report. http://www.imf.org/external/np/seminars/eng/2010/mcm/pdf/rutan1.pdf Above all these service types, ABCP programs are commonly used by banks to free up their regulatory capitals by moving the seemingly safe assets off their balance sheet. Traditionally, banks keep everything on their balance sheet and owners of the bank have to hold a certain amount of equity to meet the capital requirement. This means if a bank wants to invest in a large new project, i.e. increase its asset largely, it has to increase owners' equity proportionality. Moving such project off bank's balance sheet eliminates the need of increasing equity. Through setting up ABCP conduits, banks can fund assets all by short- term liabilities. In general, any asset class that has been funded in the term market has been funded in a conduit, and there are a wide variety of assets that are unique to the conduit market, however, at the time of 2007, the major asset of most ABCP programs is asset-backed security backed by residential mortgages. As of September 2001, there were approximately 280 active ABCP programs, with more than $650 billion in outstanding.Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Explained. Fitch Ratings. http://people.stern.nyu.edu/igiddy/ABS/fitchabcp.pdf During the mid-2000s, ABCP saw a steady rise in popularity because of their high ratings from the perspective of investors and the low borrowing rates from companies who need money. Gradually, even more conservative investors, such as money market mutual funds and retirement funds began purchasing ABCP. This optimism pushed the outstanding of ABCP to $1.3 trillion by the time of July 2007. At that time, ABCP was the largest money market instrument in the United States, following by Treasury Bills with about $940 billion outstanding. However, this trend came to an abrupt end in August 2007. During 2007, as negative information about U.S. residential mortgages spreads out, securities backed with mortgages, including sub-prime mortgages, widely held by ABCP programs of financial firms globally, started to lose their value. ABCP investors started to worry about the value of the asset backing their ABCP and stopped rolling over their position. At the beginning, sponsor banks have enough liquid to pay off these liabilities, but lack of market confidence can create a subprime mortgage crisis. On August 2007, the French bank BNP Paribas halted withdrawals from three funds invested in ABCP and suspended calculation of net asset values. Even though defaults on mortgages had been rising throughout 2007, the suspension of withdrawals by BNP Paribas has a profound effect on ABCP market. The interest rate spread of over-night ABCP and Federal funds rate increased from 10 basis points to 150 basis points within one day of announcement. Subsequently, the ABCP market experienced a modern-day bank run. Several ABCP conduits fell victim to the liquidity crisis. Since the sponsors financial institutions. such as banks only need to keep regulatory capital for on-balance sheet assets, and none for the assets funded by ABCP conduits, they got into huge trouble paying back investors who refused to roll over their ABCP. Several major financial institutions collapsed in the following year because of these solvency issues and had to be bailed out by government. See Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 for details on the crisis and see Great Recession for the recession triggered by the financial crisis. In December 2007, ABCP outstanding dropped from $1.3 trillion to $833 billion. By the end of 2008, there was no SIVs left. As of March 2013, the outstandings of ABCP were about $300 billion.Asset-backed Commercial Paper Outstanding. Federal Reserve Economic Data. http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/ABCOMP Structure An ABCP conduit is set up by a sponsoring financial institution (henceforth, sponsor). The sole purpose of a conduit is to purchase and hold financial assets from a variety of asset sellers. The conduit finances the assets by selling asset-backed commercial paper to outside investors such as money market funds or other \\"safe asset\\" investors like retirement funds. Take the conduit Grampian as an example. Grampian is a conduit set up and managed by HBOS. HBOS's management responsibilities consist of selecting the assets (Airbus, mortgages, etc.) to be purchased by Grampian and issuing short-term ABCP in order to finance the assets. HBOS sells the ABCP to outside investors such as Fidelity and rolls over the ABCP at regular intervals. Structure of an ABCP conduit As in banks, the maturity of assets in ABCP conduits generally is longer than the maturity of the liabilities. More than half of ABCP daily issuance has maturities of 1 to 4 days, referred to as \\"overnight\\", and the average maturity of outstanding paper is about 30 days. ABCP programs regularly roll over their liabilities and use proceeds from new issuances to pay off maturing commercial paper. Loan and lease receivables, which are assets commonly purchased by ABCP conduits, likely have terms of 30 days or more, and while relatively short, are still longer than most ABCP. Most of the conduit assets are medium- to long-term assets with maturities of three to five years. =Financial institution (sponsor)= The sponsors of the conduit play two roles: manage assets and provide liquidity. Sponsor types range from large U.S. commercial banks to non-bank institutions, like mortgage lenders and asset managers. Large U.S. banks have long sponsored ABCP programs, some smaller U.S. banks sponsor a very modest share. Foreign banks sponsor a substantial share of ABCP, about 40 percent in 2007. Non-bank institutions, such as mortgage lenders, finance companies, or asset managers, also sponsor a considerable share of the market. Programs sponsored by non-bank institutions grew more dramatically than other programs from 2004 to 2007, more than doubling in assets to $400 billion. The ten largest sponsors as of January 2007 are: #Citigroup (U.S.) #ABN AMRO (Netherlands) #Bank of America (U.S.) #HBOS Pls (U.K.) #JP Morgan (U.S.) #HSBC (U.K.) #Deutsche Bank AG (Germany) #Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale (France) #Barclays Plc (U.K.) #Rabobank (Netherlands) Conduits can generate significant risks for the sponsor. The sponsor‚Äôs guarantee typically covers the conduit‚Äôs roll-over risk, which is the risk that a conduit cannot refinance maturing commercial paper, possibly because of a deterioration of conduit asset values. In that case, the sponsor has to assume the losses from lower asset values, because under the guarantee sponsors are required to repurchase assets at par. In exchange for assuming this risk, the sponsor receives the conduit profits. Types of guarantees Conduit sponsors use four different types of guarantees which provide different levels of insurance to outside investors. The four types of guarantees, ranked from strongest to weakest, are full credit guarantees (\\"full credit\\"), full liquidity guarantees (\\"full liquidity\\"), extendible notes guarantees (\\"extendible notes\\"), and guarantees arranged via structured investment vehicles (SIV). ;Full credit Full credit guarantees are guarantees that require the sponsor to pay off maturing asset-backed commercial paper independent of the conduit's asset values. From a regulatory perspective, full credit guarantees are considered equivalent to on-balance sheet financing, because they expose banks to the same risks as assets on the balance sheet. Therefore, if the bank offer full credit guarantee, the backing assets will be on the balance sheet, thus are included in the calculation of capital needed to meet capital requirement. In practice, these guarantees are infrequently used by financial institutions that have to satisfy bank capital requirements. ;Full liquidity Full liquidity guarantees are similar to full credit guarantees with the main difference being that the sponsor only needs to pay off maturing asset-backed commercial paper if the conduit assets are not in default. Hence, there is a possibility that full liquidity guarantees expire before the asset-backed commercial paper matures. This form of guarantees is weaker than full credit, but from the bank's side, they can move these assets off the balance sheet. ;Extendible notes Extendible notes guarantees are similar to full liquidity guarantees with the main difference being that the conduit issuer has the discretion to extend maturing commercial paper for a limited period of time (usually 60 days or less). By extending the maturity of the commercial paper, it is more likely that the conduit's assets are in default before the commercial paper matures. From the viewpoint of an outside investor, extendible notes guarantees are therefore riskier than full liquidity guarantees. This guarantee was used by weaker financial institutions and by conduits with higher quality assets. ;SIV SIV guarantees are also similar to full liquidity guarantees with the main difference being that SIV guarantees only cover a share of the conduit liabilities (usually around 25%). Since SIV guarantees do not cover all conduit liabilities, they are considered partial insurance to outside investors. SIV guarantees were primarily used by commercial banks and other financial institutions to cover high quality assets. =Asset types= The asset types that conduits invested in are mostly asset-backed securities (ABS), residential mortgages, commercial loans and CDOs. Most of the assets are AAA-rated, some holds un-rated assets generated by the sponsor financial institution. The asset origins are mostly United States (68%), Germany (15%) and United Kingdom (10%).Acharya, Viral, Philipp Schnabl(2010). Do Global Banks Spread Global Imbalances? Asset-Backed Commercial Paper during the Financial Crisis of 2007‚Äì09. IMF Economic Review, 58(1), 37-73. =Outside investors= The outside investors are mostly risk sensitive investors like money market fund and retirement funds. Benefits Originally, banks set up ABCP conduits to finance only safe assets off-balance sheet. Since these assets are considered safe, it is socially optimal for banks to invest more at a lower cost. ABCP conduit provides a way to free up regulatory capital, and thus achieve higher efficiency. At the same time, since safe assets are moved out of balance sheet, policy makers can target regulatory capital requirements only on the risky assets, which is what remains on the balance sheet. Costs However, due to no capital requirement for off-balance sheet assets, ABCP conduits also induce excessive risk taking. For example, banks may spread their capital very thin, and invest in highly risky projects that they would not have invested absent the mitigating effects of ABCP conduit on regulatory capital requirements. Especially when the sponsor bank is big, ABCP induces high moral hazard. When good state realized, the risky project will yield very high returns, but when bad state realized, the big bank expect government to bail it out. Therefore, banks optimally take on more risk because it does not care about the losses that occur in those states of nature when it goes bankrupt. Creditors will be bailed out and the interest rate at which the bank can borrow is therefore insensitive to bankruptcy risk. This is called \\"risk shifting\\"‚Äîshifting the risk from banks to the public. Most likely, policy makers find it optimal to bail out the bank, but needless to say, it is socially very costly. Risks Most conduits minimize their credit risk by holding a diversified portfolio of high quality assets. Typically, they are restricted to purchasing AAA-rated assets or unrated assets of similar quality. Some conduits exclusively purchase unrated assets originated by their sponsoring financial institutions. Other conduits mostly purchase securitized assets originated by other financial institutions. Many conduits combine the two strategies by purchasing both securitized and un-securitized assets from several financial institutions. Outside investors consider asset-backed commercial paper a safe investment for three reasons. First, the pool of conduit assets is used as collateral to secure the asset- backed commercial paper. Second, the conduit's sponsor provides guarantees to the conduit, which ensures that the sponsor repays maturing ABCPs in case the conduit is unable to pay off the maturing paper itself. Third, ABCP is very short-term, so that investors can easily liquidate their investment by not rolling over maturing ABCPs. However, asset holdings of ABCP conduits, like at banks, are not transparent. While the vast majority of ABCP programs have credit ratings from the major rating agencies, credit support mechanisms vary and the specific assets held in the programs are not widely known. For example, some ABCP programs viewed their holdings to be 'proprietary' investment strategies and deliberately did not disclose. Thus, random events or concerns about an economic downturn can create uncertainty about asset values. This uncertainty is greater when less information is available about the assets. While ABCP programs are like banks, a key distinction, with important implications for financial stability, is that ABCP programs do not have explicit deposit insurance provided by the government. Most traditional ABCP programs are sponsored by commercial banks that provide explicit liquidity support. ABCP conduit induces regulatory arbitrage and excessive risk taking. With so few skin in the game, banks will increase their investments, and especially investments in risky projects with negative expected returns. The resulting high leverage and high risk will increase systemic risk of the financial system, which further impose huge risk on the broader economy. Types There are five principal types of ABCP program: *General purpose multi-seller *Credit arbitrage *Structured investment vehicle (SIV) *Single-seller *Loan-backed =General purpose multi-seller= The most traditional ABCP program is a multi-seller program, in which a conduit purchases receivables and loans from multiple firms. The sponsor is typically a financial institution that provides the conduit with a committed liquidity line, administers its daily operations, and sometimes also provides the conduit with credit enhancement through a letter of credit that absorbs credit losses. At the end of July 2007, just before the widespread turmoil, there were 98 multi-seller programs in the U.S. ABCP market with outstanding of $525 billion, about 45 percent of total ABCP outstanding. =Credit arbitrage= These programs involve banks sponsoring conduits to finance long-term assets through a special purpose entity that has a lower regulatory capital charge than if the assets were held on balance sheet. The sponsor banks typically provide full liquidity support. By using off-balance sheet funding, commercial banks exploit regulatory capital arbitrage opportunities. In July 2007, there were 35 programs that accounted for about 13 percent of the U.S. ABCP market. =SIV= SIVs fund highly rated securities. But unlike the credit arbitrage programs, SIVs do not have explicit agreements with their sponsoring banks for committed back-stop liquidity lines covering all their short-term liabilities. Instead SIVs relied on dynamic liquidity management strategies, which involved liquidating assets to pay investors if needed. At their peak in July 2007, there were 35 SIVs that accounted for $84 billion of U.S. ABCP. Some ABCP is issued by collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), sometimes called SIV-lites. CDOs are similar to SIVs in structure, but are not actively managed and tend to rely on explicit but only partial liquidity support. There were 36 ABCP CDO programs in July 2007, with ABCP outstanding of $47 billion. =Single- seller= Single-seller programs involve a conduit that issues commercial paper backed by assets from only one originator, which frequently also sponsors the conduit. The majority of single-seller conduits mainly fund credit-card receivables, mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, or auto loans. Such programs tended not to have explicit liquidity support, but were thought to be implicitly supported by originators. In July 2007, there were 40 non- mortgage single-seller programs, about 11 percent of the U.S. ABCP market. There also were 11 mortgage single-seller programs that primarily warehoused mortgages prior to their securitization. =Loan-backed= Loan-backed programs are bank-sponsored programs and fund direct loans to the bank's corporate customers. These loans are generally closely managed by the bank, and have a variety of covenants designed to reduce credit risk. Relation to 2008-09 global financial crises One feature of ABCP is that they provide the ability to fund bank assets that do not appear on bank balance sheets. One result of keeping these assets off-balance sheet is that they do not factor in for regulatory capital requirements. Thus the ABCP market may contribute to systemic risk. Before the 2008-09 financial crises, the global financial system \\"manufactured\\" risk-less assets, totaling over $1.2 trillion, by selling short-term ABCP to risk-averse investors, predominantly U.S. money market funds, and investing the proceeds primarily in long-term U.S. assets. As negative information about U.S. assets came to light in August 2007, banks experienced difficulties in rolling over ABCP and as a result several banks were bailed out by the U.S. government. Reduced liquidity tightened credit, affecting production sectors. As a result, economic activity worldwide was slowed and international trade declined. Governments and central banks responded with unprecedented fiscal stimulus, monetary policy expansion and institutional bailouts.

Examples include 7 Up, Saks Fifth Avenue, Audi A4, Canon A75. They may serve as abbreviations (e.g. 3M, formerly known as the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company), indicate model extensions (iPhone 3G, iPhone 4, etc.), symbolize physical product attributes (the v-shaped V8 engine), incorporate technical attributes (AMD32 chips use 32-bit processors), refer to inventory codes or internal design numbers (e.g., Levi's 501). Kunter Gunasti and William T. Ross (2010) define two dimensions of alphanumeric brand names: \\"link\\", or the connection between the brand name and a specific product feature or the product as a whole; and \\"alignability\\", or whether the preferences for a product can be aligned with the numbers included in the brand names in an ascending or descending trend. Selcan Kara, Gunasti and Ross (2015) delineated the number and letter components of alphanumeric brands and observed that for new brand extensions firms can either change the letters or numbers of their parent brand names. Altering the number components of brand names (e.g. Audi A3 vs. A4 vs. A6 vs. A8) led to more favorable consumer reactions compared to changing the letter components (e.g. Mercedes C350 vs. E350 vs. S350). Gunasti and Timucin Ozcan (2016) further categorized alphanumeric brand names as either \\"round\\" or \\"non-round\\". They showed that use of \\"round numbers\\" in brand names is pervasive because this practice increases the tendency of consumers to perceive products as more complete (including all necessary attributes). For example, labeling an identical product with an \\"S200\\" brand (round number) as opposed to an \\"S198\\" or \\"S203\\" brand can make consumers believe that the product is superior and more well- rounded. They also found that the presence of competitor alphanumeric brand name (e.g. Garmin 370) can affect consumer choices among the focal brand (e.g. TomTom 350 vs. TomTom 360). Gunasti and Berna Devezer (2016) observed that this effect occurs only for competing firms' products.

Released in 1983, it followed a 1982 album of the same name. The album was released on CD as the first half of the 1994 compilation, Sink With Kalifornija. Origins and recording In July 1982, Youth Brigade recorded their debut album entitled Sound & Fury Mixed by Ira Malek. However, during the Someone Got Their Head Kicked In tour with Social Distortion (as chronicled in the documentary Another State of Mind) in the summer of 1982, which marked their first national tour, Youth Brigade realized that they were disappointed with the album and stopped the pressing at only 800 copies. After the end of the Someone Got Their Head Kicked In tour, the band returned home and decided to record a new album entitled Sound & Fury, keeping only four tracks from the original (\\"Fight to Unite\\", \\"The Circle\\", \\"You Don't Understand\\", \\"Sound & Fury\\"). Recording sessions for the second version began in March 1983 at Perspective Sound, Sun Valley, California, with Thom Wilson producing. The sessions lasted only a month, concluding in April. Critical reception Allmusic writer Victor W. Valdivia claimed that Sound & Fury does a \\"much better job, proving that Youth Brigade has enough musical talent to justify their prominence\\" and described the members of Youth Brigade \\"a superb ensemble who can construct nicely energetic pop-punk anthems.\\" Valdivia also described \\"Sink With California\\" (the first track on the re-release) and \\"Fight to Unite\\" \\"hopeful anthems of unity and action that are neither nihilistic nor simpleminded, as too many other punk songs of the era are, and are backed with hard-driving punk to boot\\", while he also called \\"Men in Blue\\" the \\"standard anti-police rant\\".

The road later became part of many highways and expressways, although it was never built and signed as a single road (and some portions never became highways). Route description The Cape Cod Expressway in Connecticut, which was the greater part of the planned route that was actually completed. Today this road serves as Connecticut's portion of Interstate 95. Coming out of New York City, the route would have followed Interstate 95 along the modern New England Thruway until the Connecticut border, where it would meet up with what later became the Connecticut Turnpike. Once it reached Rhode Island, the expressway would follow the present-day Route 138 to Route 24, Interstate 195 (where it would cross into Massachusetts), Route 25, and U.S. Route 6 all the way to Provincetown, Massachusetts. History During the early second half of the 20th century, states began to experience traffic congestion affecting local roads. In response, many states began building expressways in order to alleviate this congestion. In 1953, the governors of New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts began to plan a expressway that would link New York City to Provincetown, Massachusetts. The highway was projected to cost around $75 million, and would be between four and six lanes wide. Tolls would be charged for parts of the highway, although the road as a whole would not be tolled. The route was billed as \\"the most direct and shortest highway route between the present and potentially major urban-industrial and recreational concentrations, and between significant military installations of the shore route area.\\" The route was built as planned from New York City into Rhode Island. Because of highway revolts, the route along Route 138 to Route 24 ended up not being completed (both roads were also concurrently signed with Interstate 895 at one point, as well). In Massachusetts, the Charles M. Braga Jr. Memorial Bridge, which carries Interstate 195, was built with the eventual aim of carrying the expressway. Route 25 in Massachusetts would eventually be constructed along the proposed route of the expressway. In Bourne, plans for the expressway turned into the Southside Connector which was planned around the same time as the expressway, but also never built. On Cape Cod, the road turned into the Mid-Cape Highway and was constructed as an expressway as far as the Orleans Rotary. Because the road served as a main thoroughfare for towns north of Orleans, the expressway idea likely was abandoned, although between North Truro and Provincetown, grade-separated interchanges were constructed in remote sections.

The foundation was founded in February 2004 under the name eSpindle Learning. In August 2010, the name was changed to LearnThat Foundation, and its domain was moved to www.LearnThat.org. The program is branded as LearnThatWord. History The organization was launched by parents, educators, English language learners and writers looking for a comprehensive solution to learning English vocabulary and spelling. Its board members include a Microsoft executive and a Senior Research Associate at the Education Development Center's Center for Children and Technology. Premium membership fees range from $9.50 a month to $299 for a 10-year membership. The organization had 5000 members in 2007. It has since grown to over 300,000 members.  Features  The program is based on its own dictionary database, containing 180,000 English words. The Open Dictionary of English contains audio from around the world, video snippets using the word in context, a large list of user samples and idioms, definitions from various sources, images, tutoring comments and much more. The program uses quizzes that are set for each member's learning profile, providing personalized spaced repetition review. In August 2010, the core program was renamed LearnThatWord. Vocabulary tutoring is freely available to registered users. Spelling tutoring is a premium feature and requires a paid upgrade. Performance reports and rewards are premium features as well. LearnThatWord also offers classroom features and allows teachers to send words directly to student accounts. All quiz units follow test-study principles Gates, A. I., An experimental comparison of the study-test and test-study methods in spelling. Journal of Educational Psychology, 1931, 22, 1-19 to provide adaptive tutoring. Sessions are designed as quizzes. The learner first receives feedback on their input, and then can explore the word in depth. This enhances results because it optimizes study time for the individual and each word. The instant feedback provided in this formative assessment motivates and accelerates learning. Words known can be set aside, while those that are not yet learned will enter LearnThatWord's practice cycle. Practice words are reviewed over future sessions until the learner has answered correctly over a sequence of subsequent quizzes. Additional spaced review features are under development. LearnThatWord also offers a range of rewards for study effort. Members can select from a large selection of ready- made goal modules, add their own word lists, or add a list from the word list archive. The goal modules draw on the ODE's 180,000 word database. Large linguistic data sets merged with the word database allow for proper classification of words. Among others, LearnThatWord offers a Spelling Bee goal module of close to 30,000 words and an SAT module of over 5,000 words. Detailed frequency datasets from the world's largest English language corpora allow LearnThatWord to present words in a logical order: Members can start with easy, everyday words and advance to harder ones in managed progression. Currently LearnThatWord accepts both US and UK spelling variants as correct. Further localization is under development. Study modes The program offers three quiz options. =Vocabulary quiz= Free vocabulary tutoring is available to all members. To avoid problems typically associated with multiple choice format. LearnThatWord takes a variety of steps to minimize guessing. In every session, words are matched with different alternate partners. In addition, the quiz format changes. A word will be tested in word-definitions, definition-words, and image-words constellations. Active word entry (spelling) is an optional last step, available to premium members. =Spelling quiz= Spelling quiz follows the classic spelling test/spelling bee format. The member hears a word, and can review the corresponding definition and a usage example. They are then required to enter the word into the text entry field. =Combo quiz= Combo quiz challenges the member to find the word based on definition, usage example and the number of letters in the word. Members can then request first letter, last letter, and finally the audio for the word. Entering the word correctly before listening to the audio earns a bonus point for the user. Nonprofit literacy campaign At the start of the 2010/11 school year, LearnThat Foundation started to make free tutoring available to third graders in the U.S. and Canada. This program, known as Vocabulary Junction, was expanded to serve all English learners, worldwide, during their first three years of learning the language. Teachers at public and tuition- free schools can request premium licenses for their classrooms by contacting the LearnThatWord support team.  Awards  The program was awarded a Parents Choice Foundation Award in 2006 as well as a Teachers' Choice Award (by Learning Magazine) in 2008.
