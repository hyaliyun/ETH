It is a golf simulation game that allows the player to choose from 14 different characters, each with different strengths and weaknesses, to play on any of the game's 6 courses, varying greatly in difficulty and atmosphere. Along with normal match and stroke modes of play, the game offers a tour mode, which simulates the career of a chosen character, a mission mode, consisting of a series of challenges that gradually increase in difficulty, and minigames, including a sudden death style of gameplay and a near-pin style of gameplay. The game was released under Eidos' short-lived Fresh Games branding, and is the only game within its lineup to be a GameCube exclusive, while the other four games were PlayStation 2 exclusives. Gameplay Controls The user interface during typical gameplay Swingerz Golf was made exclusively for GameCube, so the controls are designed specifically for a GameCube controller. The player-controlled golfer can be aimed in any direction with the analog stick and can change clubs with the R and L buttons to in any distance or direction possible up to that golfer's particular power limitations. With the X and Y buttons, the player may raise up the camera angle, zoom in on the hole, or rotate the camera around to see what is around an obstacle. Hitting the B button will switch between a power shot and a normal shot. To swing, the player pulls back on the C Stick until the desired power level is reached, then flicks it forward. The accuracy of the shot depends on how straight the stick was moved. If it is nearly or exactly straight, the word \\"Excellent\\" will show and the player's character will regain a bit of stamina. Ratings of \\"Great\\" and \\"Good\\" mean the ball will fly more or less straight, but the player will lose stamina. A rating of \\"Bad\\" or \\"Poor\\" means that the character will miss the ball, hit it short, or hit it well off the mark. By holding the D-pad in any direction during the swing, the player may add spin to the ball to give it a certain flight pattern or behavior upon landing. On the green, controls are similar, but there are some added visual cues. Once the player has reached or is close enough to see the green, a grid appears, showing the player how a ball will react on any given part of the green. Pressing left and right on the D-pad will make the lines thicker and more bold, making it easier to see on televisions that have a lower display resolutions. Modes of Play The primary mode of single-player gameplay in Swingerz Golf is the Tour Mode. In this mode, the player is given a series of tournaments and duels to play through in order to unlock new characters as well as specialty clubs and balls. In addition to the Tour Mode, Swingerz Golf has an exhibition mode for both match play and stroke play, a practice mode, a survival mode, and a mission mode. In exhibition mode, players may play a game without any consequence to his current game status. Survival mode pits the player against successively harder computer opponents until he loses a one-hole skin match. Mission mode gives the player several levels of challenging scenarios to complete. Challenges include hitting the ball within a certain distance of the cup, hitting a given number of \\"Excellent\\" rated shots in a row, and holing out under par, among others. Multiplayer Although Swingerz Golf does not support online play, it does support multiplayer gaming over one console. Up to four players or computer-controller players can play a match together, even if 4 controllers are not available. There are three modes of multiplayer play. These are stroke play, skins, and near-pin. In stroke play, two to four players compete against each other over 18 holes of any chosen course. The winner is the player who has the lowest score at the end of the 18th hole. In match play, 2 players play through 18 holes, competing for the lowest score on each hole. For each hole, the player who achieves the lowest score earns a point. The player with the most points at the end of the last hole wins. In near-pin mode, each player gets one shot per hole. The player that lands on the green closest to the pin wins that particular hole. Scoring and winning are the same as that of match play. Reception The game was met with average reception upon release, as GameRankings gave it a score of 70.50%, while Metacritic gave it 72 out of 100.

Since 1862 it has primarily investigated ghosts and hauntings. History The club has its roots in Cambridge in 1855, where fellows at Trinity College began to discuss ghosts and psychic phenomena. Launched officially in London in 1862, it counted Charles Dickens and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle among its members. One of the club's earliest investigations was of the Davenport brothers and their \\"spirit cabinet\\" hoax, the club challenging the Davenports' claim of contacting the dead. The group continued to undertake practical investigations of spiritualist phenomena, a topic then in vogue, meeting to discuss ghostly subjects. The Ghost Club dissolved in the 1870s following the death of Dickens. 1882 revitalisation The club was revived on All Saints Day 1882 by the medium Stainton Moses and Alaric Alfred Watts. initially claiming to be the original founders, without acknowledging its origins. In 1882, the Society for Psychical Research (SPR), with whom there was an initial overlap, was founded at a similar time.Oppenheim, Janet. (1988). The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914. Cambridge University Press. p. 138. \\"Moses became one of the first vice-presidents and council members of the SPR\\" While the SPR was a body devoted to scientific study, the Ghost Club remained a selective and secretive organization of convinced believers for whom psychic phenomena were an established fact. Stainton Moses resigned from the vice presidency of the SPR in 1886 and thereafter devoted himself to the Ghost Club. Membership was small (82 members over 54 years) and women were not allowed but during this period it attracted some of the most original and controversial minds in psychical research. These included Sir William Crookes Sir Oliver Lodge, Nandor Fodor and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The archives of the Club reveal that the names of members, both living and dead, were solemnly recited each November 2. Each individual, living or dead, was recognized a member of the Club. On more than one occasion deceased members were believed to have made their presence felt. Also involved were the poet W. B. Yeats (joined 1911) and Frederick Bligh Bond (joined 1925), who became infamous with his investigations into spiritualism at Glastonbury. Bligh Bond later left the country and became active in the American Society for Psychical Research. He was ordained into the Old Catholic Church and rejoined the Ghost Club on his return to Britain in 1935. The Principal of Jesus College, Cambridge, Arthur Grey, fictionalized the Ghost Club in 1919 as \\"The Everlasting Club\\" in a ghost story that many still believe to be true. Early 20th century The 20th century's move from s√©ance room investigation to laboratory-based research meant the Ghost Club fell out of touch with contemporary psychic research. Harry Price, famous for his investigation into Borley Rectory, joined as a member in 1927 as did psychologist Nandor Fodor who represented the changing approach to psychical research taking place. With attendance falling, the club closed in 1936 after 485 meetings. The Ghost Club records were deposited in the British Museum under the proviso that they would remain closed until 1962 out of respect for confidentiality. Within 18 months, Price relaunched the Ghost Club as a society dining event where psychic researchers and mediums delivered after- dinner talks. Price decided to admit women to the club, also specifying that it was not a spiritualist church or association but a group of skeptics that gathered to discuss paranormal topics. Members in this period included , Sir Julian Huxley, Algernon Blackwood, Sir Osbert Sitwell and Lord Amwell. Following Price's death in 1948, the club was again relaunched by members of the committee, Philip Paul and Peter Underwood. From 1962 Underwood served as President; many accounts of club activities are found in his books. In the early 1960s two young men, Theodore Cary and Patrick Hewitt, brought the club back to national prominence, when they established a chapter in Harrison Township, Michigan. Tom Perrott joined the club in 1967 and served as Chairman from 1971 to 1993. In 1993, the club underwent a period of internal disruption, during which Underwood left to become Life President of another society he had revived called \\"The Ghost Club Society\\".The Ghost Club Society The Ghost Club later expanded its remit to include the study of UFOs, dowsing, cryptozoology and similar topics. Recent history In 1998, Perrott resigned as chairman (although he remained active in club affairs), and barrister Alan Murdie was elected as his successor. Murdie has written a number of ghost books including Haunted Brighton and regularly writes for Fortean Times. In 2005 he was succeeded by Kathy Gearing, the club's first female chairperson. Gearing announced her resignation in the club's Summer 2009 newsletter.The Ghost Club newsletter, Summer 2009, page 2 The club continues to meet monthly at the Victory Services Club near Marble Arch, in London. Several investigations are performed in England every year. In recent times, investigations have been organised in Scotland by the club's Scottish Area Investigation Coordinator.

He also was a member of the Buffalo Bills in the American Football League (AFL). He played college football at Indiana University. Early years Borden attended William L. Dickinson High School, where he was an All-state fullback and tackle. He also practiced the discus throw, the shot put and the two-mile run. He accepted a scholarship from Indiana University. As a freshman, he played at defensive tackle. He played as a defensive end in his next two years. As a senior, he was moved back to defensive tackle. He never missed a game, playing in 36 straight contests. Professional career Green Bay Packers Borden was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the 25th round (293rd overall) of the 1955 NFL Draft. During this early period, Borden was one of the few African-American players on the Packers along with Frank Purnell, who played in 1957. When he could not find housing within the city limits, he had to room at a rundown motel just outside Green Bay. A number of Packers were also staying at the motel. They told the manager he would lose their business if Borden could not room there. Quarterback Bart Starr befriended Borden and frequently had him and his family at Starr's home for dinner. He was a starter at defensive end during four straight seasons. When Vince Lombardi was hired as the new head coach for the 1959 season, Borden was the only African-American player on the roster and Lombardi had to assist him in finding a decent place to live. He wasn't protected for the NFL Expansion Draft due to a knee injury. Dallas Cowboys Borden was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the 1960 NFL Expansion Draft and became the first starter at left defensive end in franchise history, registering 48 tackles. The next year, he was switched to the right side, after John Gonzaga was traded and Bob Lilly was drafted. He was released on September 11, 1962. Buffalo Bills In 1962, he was signed by the Buffalo Bills of the American Football League. He played in three games before an ankle injury sidelined him for the rest of the season.

It was Konami's third fighting game after the 1985 releases Yie Ar Kung-Fu and Galactic Warriors and the 1986 release Yie Ar Kung-Fu II, and their first release that came after the success of Capcom's 1991 arcade hit Street Fighter II. Gameplay Screenshot of the arcade version Martial Champion follows the same fighting game conventions established by Street Fighter II: the player's character fights against his or her opponent in best two-out-of-three matches in a single player tournament mode with the computer or against another human player. The player has a character roster of ten fighters to choose from, each with their own unique fighting style and special techniques. The control layout differs from Street Fighter II and most other typical fighting games inspired by it. Martial Champion's control system is derived from the control system of Yie Ar Kung-Fu, but simplified to simply high, medium and low attacks, instead of having to press an attack button and a direction. One unique feature this arcade game has is stages that are similar to the \\"high- jump\\" stages seen in Capcom's later fighting games such as X-Men: Children of the Atom. Another unique feature is that certain characters carry weapons which can be disarmed by their opponent and used against them. Characters There are ten playable fighters to select from. After the player defeats all ten opponents in the tournament mode (including a clone of their character), they face a final computer-controlled boss character. In the later localized worldwide versions, Chaos and Titi have their names switched (similar to the rotation of the boss characters' names in Street Fighter II, probably done to avoid associations with the word \\"titty\\"), with Chaos being a Chinese vampire and Titi being an Egyptian princess. * - A rotund Middle Eastern man armed with a scimitar. Billed as being from Saudi Arabia even though the displayed flag is Iraq's. * - An eyepatched soldier from the United States similar to Guile. * - A Chinese vampire from Hong Kong. Utilizes a pair of metal claws and his tongue in battle. Known in the international versions as \\"Titi\\". * - A French fighter utilizing a three-section staff or sansetsukon. * - A Chinese martial artist from China. * - A Japanese martial artist who was inspired by Ryu from the Street Fighter series and Lee from the Famicom and MSX versions of Yie Ar Kung-Fu. * - A spear-wielding tribesman from Kenya. * - A blonde American female ninja. * - An Egyptian princess (the name derived from Nefertiti). Known in the US and World versions as \\"Chaos\\". * - A kabuki fighter from Japan. * - The final boss and the tallest character in the game. He is unplayable and his move set contains techniques lifted from other characters. Home version Martial Champion was exclusively ported to the PC Engine as a Super CD-ROM¬≤ release. Unlike the arcade version, which was released worldwide, the PC Engine version was released only in Japan. On May 13, 2008, this version was later re-released for the Wii Virtual Console in Japan. Sprites and the background were shrunk, while the background became a still image instead of an animated one and the foreground objects and people on each stage were removed. The intro and outro are different compared to the arcade version's; however, the original arcade intro that shows Jin and Goldor battling each other with instrumental music playing in the background is also included. In the PC Engine version, the other intro starts with the game's logo and a vocal song, then shows Jin putting on his headband and looks ahead of himself with birds flying by him, while Rachael and Goldor battle against each other. At the end, Goldor casts his Gol Wave toward the pitch-black darkness missing his target Rachael, while the final boss, Salamander, fades in from it.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Martial Champion on their July 15, 1993 issue as being the second most-successful table arcade unit of the year.

Gowdy saw more playing time in subsequent seasons, but when World War I broke out, he became the first major league player to sign up. He saw considerable action in France with the 166th Infantry Regiment of the Ohio National Guard, including some of the worst trench fighting in the war. When he returned in , he got his old job as a catcher back, but not before going on a speaking tour of the United States, detailing his war experiences. Four years later, he was traded back to the Giants, where he played in the 1923 and 1924 World Series, but his heroics weren't repeated, as he committed a costly error which led to the game-winning run in Game 7 against the Washington Senators.\\"How Senators' Strategy Won for Johnson\\", by Muddy Ruel, Baseball Digest, October 1964, Vol. 23, No. 9, ISSN 0005-609X In , the Giants released him.

Later he left his coaching job to serve as a captain in World War II at the age of 53. He's believed to be the only big-league baseball player to serve in both wars. Career statistics In a seventeen-year major league career, Gowdy played in 1,050 games, accumulating 738 hits in 2,735 at bats for a .270 career batting average along with 21 home runs and 322 runs batted in. He ended his career with a .975 fielding percentage. Gowdy twice led the National League in caught stealing percentage. His 52.58% career caught stealing percentage ranks him sixth in major league history.Caught Stealing career leaders at Baseball Reference Gowdy's reputation as a defensive stand out is enhanced because of the era in which he played. In the Deadball Era, catchers played a huge defensive role, given the large number of bunts and stolen base attempts, as well as the difficulty of handling the spitball pitchers who dominated pitching staffs.

Plot  The novel tells the story of Shori, a 53-year-old member of the Ina species, who appears to be a ten- year-old African-American girl. The Ina are nocturnal, long-lived, and derive sustenance by drinking human blood. Though they are physically superior to humans, both in strength and ability to heal from injury, the Ina depend on humans to survive. Therefore, their relationships are symbiotic, with the Ina's venom providing significant boost to their humans' immune systems and extending their lives up to 200 years. However, withdrawal from this venom will also lead to the human's death. The story opens as Shori awakens with no knowledge of who or where she is, in a cave and suffering from critical injuries. Although she is burned and has skull trauma, she kills and eats the first creature that approaches her. Eating this creature allows her to heal quickly enough to walk and explore on her own. She runs into the ruins where a construction worker named Wright picks her up on the side of the road; Shori bites Wright because she finds his scent irresistible, and they begin their relationship. While staying at Wright's uncle's cabin, Shori realizes she's in need of more blood, so she feeds on other inhabitants in the town and develops a relationship with an older woman named Theodora. Shori and Wright return to the burned-out, abandoned village near where she woke up to learn more about her past. They eventually meet Iosif, Shori's father, who tells her the burned-out town was once her home where she had lived with her mother and sisters. They also learn that Wright and Shori's mutually beneficial relationship makes Wright Shori's symbiont. Further, Shori's dark skin is the result of a genetic modification: the Ina were experimenting to make their kind resistant to daylight. All other Ina are white-skinned. Later, before Shori is able to move in with Iosif, his settlement is burned down as Shori's home was. Shori and Wright meet the only two human symbionts who survived, Celia and Brook. Shori adopts Celia and Brook as her own symbionts to save their lives. Their bonding is initially uncomfortable for all of them, however, as symbionts become addicted to the venom of one particular Ina. The four flee to another house that Iosif owns. While at this new house during the day, they are attacked by several men with gasoline and guns. Because of the genetic enhancements made on Shori, she is awake and they are able to escape. The group travels to the settlement of the Gordon family (old friends of Iosif), where they are welcomed and guarded by human symbionts during the day. The attackers also raid the settlement, but Shori and the human symbionts are able to fight back. They capture three attackers alive. The Gordon family interrogates the intruders and finds that they are the same attackers who killed Shori's parents and have been sent by the Silks, another Ina family. The Gordons suspect the attacks on Shori are motivated by disdain for the genetic experimentation that created her. After failing to get a confession from the Silks, the Gordon family calls a Council of Judgment on Shori's behalf. Thirteen Ina families and their symbionts come to the Gordon settlement to discuss the Silks' attack on Shore. During the Council, the Silk representative, Katharine Dahlman, sends one of her symbionts to kill Theodora, Shori's symbiont. This attack succeeds. Thus, in addition to issuing a punishment upon the Silks, the Council must also punish Katharine Dahlman. The Silks' sons are taken from them to be adopted by other Ina families, ensuring that the Silk line will die out. Katharine Dahlman is sentenced to have her legs amputated. She refuses this punishment and attempts to kill Shori, who fights back and fatally wounds her. Katharine is killed by being decapitated and burned. After regaining consciousness, Shori decides to join the Brathwaite family and learn the ways of the Ina to create her own family. Main themes  Vampire figure  One of the most commented aspects of Fledgling is its unusual type of vampire, the result of Butler's fusion of vampire fiction with science fiction. While the Ina is simply another species coexisting with humanity, the traditional vampire's monstrosity and abnormality routinely symbolizes deviant sexuality and decadence, serves as a foil for humanity, or is a projection of repressed sexual desire or fear of sexual or racial contamination.Sanchez-Taylor, Joy-Ann. \\"Octavia Butler's Fledgling and Daniel Jose Older's \\"Phantom Overload\\": The Ethnic Undead.\\" Science Fiction/Fantasy and the Representation of Ethnic Futurity.

They are not ruthless, threatening, predatory, intimidating, or generally antagonistic to humans.Strong, Melissa J. \\"The Limits of Newness: Hybridity in Octavia E. Butler's Fledgling.\\" FEMSPEC: An Interdisciplinary Feminist Journal Dedicated to Critical and Creative Work in the Realms of Science Fiction, Fantasy, Magical Realism, Surrealism, Myth, Folklore, and Other Supernatural Genres 11.1 (2011): 27-43. Instead, they create close-knit Ina-human communities where they cohabitate with selected humans in symbiotic relationships. In fact, as Pramrod Nayar notes, Butler creates an alternate history where humans and Ina have always coexisted in \\"non-hierarchic, interdependent and unified ecosystems\\".Nayar, Pramod K. \\"Vampirism and Posthumanism in Octavia Butler's Fledgling.\\" Notes on Contemporary Literature 41.2 (2011). Aside from their unusual relationships with humans, the Ina is quite ordinary. Steven Shaviro describes them as having \\"a culture, with laws and customs, kinship groups, a religion and ethics and a politics, and disputes and power struggles about all these things‚Äîjust as any group of human beings does\\".Shaviro, Steven. \\"Exceeding the Human: Power and Vulnerability in Octavia Butler's Fiction.\\" In Rebecca J. Holden and Nisi Shawl. Strange Matings: Science Fiction, Feminism, African American Voices, and Octavia E. Butler. Seattle, WA: Aqueduct Press, 2013. Butler even renders the Ina less than perfect in that they are prone to the intolerance and bigotry usually reserved for humans.  Race  Some critics view Butler's decision to endow her protagonist with a larger dose of melanin than what is normal for the Ina as a metaphor for how the concept of race is created. Ali Brox, for example, points out that Shori is not just \\"made black\\" biologically, but also socially when Ina fixate on her difference.Brox, Ali. \\"Every age has the vampire it needs\\": Octavia Butler's Vampiric Vision in Fledgling.\\" Utopian Studies 19.3 (2008): 391-409. Thus, Shori's skin color forces her to defend herself from a hostile world before she has even learned about institutionalized hierarchies. Ina bias against humans also serves as a comment on the history of human bigotry, specifically the prejudices of whites against blacks. As Sanchez-Taylor explains, \\"[t]he displacement of the notion of race into a species conflict allows Butler to have a black protagonist and have a discussion of intolerance without the need to partake in the history of human racism\\". In Fledgling, this racial discussion takes on a hopeful tone when the majority of the Ina acknowledge Shori as one of their own. Additionally, endowing Shori with a specific racial identity serves to deconstruct negative stereotypes of blackness. As a black protagonist, she becomes the vehicle through which Butler articulates the lack of Black in the vampire genre and challenges traditional notions of white males as heroes. Moreover, because her blackness was conceived as an evolutionary advantage, it inverts racist notions of blackness as a biological contaminant that leads to degeneracy. The vampire protagonist of Fledgling is even more unusual, as she has been genetically enhanced. While the Ina are stereotypically white, as is traditional for vampires, Shori's genetic makeup includes human melanin, which renders her skin brown, a necessary trait for her kind to be able to survive exposure to the sun. Sanchez-Taylor suggests that Butler's choice in making Shori dark-skinned aligns Fledgling 's narrative with the Afrofuturist idea of defying the predominantly white vampire stereotype, such as those represented in Bram Stoker's or Anne Rice's novels. Such characters traditionally symbolize white masculinity; instead, Butler replaces them with a black, female main character. Additionally, Shori is portrayed as less intimidating than stereotypical vampires. As Melissa Strong notes, Shori's diminutive size makes her seem non-threatening. Her treatment of symbionts is kind and understanding: instead of considering her symbionts as victims or pawns, Shori's relationship with them reflects mutuality and balance. When Shori awakes at the beginning of the novel she discovers that she is covered in scars: \\"My skin was scarred, badly scarred over every part of my body that I could see. The scars were broad, creased, shiny patches of mottled red-brown skin.\\" This description recalls the scars on the bodies of enslaved Africans in the Americas, due to the wounds inflicted by slave masters. LaMonda Horton-Stallings describes Shori's memory loss at the beginning of Fledgling as invoking the erasure of physical and collective memory through Transatlantic slavery. At the beginning of the novel we do not know the race of the narrator, and she has forgotten about the social concept of race, which is first raised in the book when Wright asks Shori: \\"Ordinary sun exposure burns your skin even though you're black?\\" (37) Shori responds: \\"'I'm...' I stopped. I had been about to protest that I was brown, not black, but before I could speak, I understood what he meant.\\" (37) This immediately triggers another memory, and Shori tells Wright, \\"I think I'm an experiment. I think I can withstand the sun better than... others of my kind.\\" In this sequence the concept of human racial categories is connected with the theme of genetic experimentation and racial difference among the Ina.  Speciesism as an allegory of racism  Several scholars have noted how Ina discrimination against Shori doubles as commentary on human racist practices. According to Steven Shaviro, racism is the major factor in the conflict between Shori and Ina speciesists such as the Silk family, who view humans as enemies who have annihilated Ina throughout history. These Ina maintain that Ina and human must remain separate species with the Ina as the dominant partner. They consider Shori to be somehow biologically different to the rest of the Ina population, as not even belonging to the same species as them. They refuse to see the shared characteristics between Shori and the rest of the Ina; instead, they deride her because of her difference. What rewrites these Ina's speciesism as racism, according to Shaviro, is that the genes that make Shori \\"part human\\" are also the genes that make her black, as opposed to their \\"almost grotesquely albino\\" skin tone. In fact, as Shari Evans notes, the racial insult Russell Silk hurls at Shori during the Council of Judgment (\\"murdering black mongrel bitch\\") negates the Ina's avowed difference from human prejudice and instead evoke white supremacy.Evans, Shari. \\"From 'Hierarchical Behavior' to Strategic Amnesia: Structures of Memory and Forgetting in Octavia Butler's Fledgling.\\" In Rebecca J. Holden and Nisi Shawl. Strange Matings: Science Fiction, Feminism, African American Voices, and Octavia E. Butler. Seattle, WA : Aqueduct Press, 2013. These human-hating Ina, therefore, commit the equivalent of a hate-crime by destroying all of Shori's family, fueled by an ideology of racial purity and superiority that is not much different than that of Nazis or the Ku Klux Klan. As Ali Brox explains, Shori's hybridity becomes the focus of their hatred because it exposes the falsity of their claims to purity and reminds them of their past abject condition at the hands of humans.  Hybridity  Fledglings protagonist is a genetically manipulated creature who combines Ina and human DNA. Her hybridity is perceived as a threat by Ina speciecists, who insist that the separation of Ina and human is essential to maintain the purity of the Ina species. As Ali Brox argues, Shori's existence \\"opens up a space of cultural uncertainty and instability\\" that forces Ina families such as the Silks, who suffer the delusion that there is a \\"pure\\" and \\"superior\\" Ina race, to admit they were once weak, oppressed, and killed by humans. These Ina are hostile towards Shori and interpret her hybridity as a sign of degeneracy. As Gates points out, because her body is a sign of Ina-human miscegenation \\"[s]he is called at various times a dog, a dirty little nigger bitch, a murdering black mongrel bitch, and more\\". Butler's narrative, however, shows that Shori's hybridity is, in fact, an evolutionary advantage. First, it allows her to be awake during the day, which permits her to survive multiple attacks on herself and her symbionts. Second, it makes her venom very powerful, which makes her scent extremely attractive to male Ina and also allows her to collect symbionts easily, making her kind more adaptable than the average Ina. In addition, Shori's hybridity also symbolizes an enhanced or \\"correct\\" type of mutualistic symbiosis, as she literally embodies human and Ina DNA working together. Thus, Butler connects hybridity to the survival of not just the Ina, but also of humanity. As Pramrod Nayar contends, in Fledgling hybridity means to take on the qualities of the other race and thus becomes a \\"companionate species\\" of others in order to survive.  Mutualistic symbiosis  In Fledgling, humans and Ina are bonded into a form of mutualistic symbiosis, a type of relationship that Shari Evans connects to the concept of \\"partnership\\" as defined in Butler's Parable of the Talents: \\"offering the greatest possible benefit while doing the least possible harm\\". While in the Parable novels the purpose of partnership is to ameliorate the negative effects of beings or processes that cannot be resisted or avoided, in Fledgling mutualistic symbiosis serves to challenge the idea that the Ina are a superior species by making Ina and humans interdependent of each other. As Susana Morris explains, even though the Ina can satisfy their need for companionship, physical contact, and sexual pleasure with one another, they also must have a deep emotional connection with their symbionts in order to survive. Likewise, humans crave intimacy with one particular Ina after they have been infected by her or his venomous bite, and may die when they lose their Ina. Butler devotes several moments in the novel to portray the discomfort this required loss of agency causes in the human symbionts. Nevertheless, Fledgling is the first time that Butler illustrates a co-dependent relationship from the point of view of the dominating partner, unlike in previous works such as her novel Dawn or her celebrated short story \\"Bloodchild\\". Scholars have linked Fledglings mutualistic symbiosis to various theoretical positions. Pramrod Nayar sees it as a fictional depiction of the relationship that professor Donna Haraway defines as \\"companion species\\" in \\"Encounters with Companion Species: Entangling Dogs, Baboons, Philosophers, and Biologists\\". Joy Sanchez- Taylor and Shari Evans recognize it as a form of social commentary: human beings must move away from parasitic, hierarchical relationships and toward symbiosis with each other and other species. Critic Susana Morris connects Fledglings symbiotic relationships to the Afrofuturistic feminist desire to portray liberation from current forms of hegemonic dominance. Thus, the \\"cooperation, interdependence, and complex understandings of power\\" that mutualistic symbiosis represents becomes Butler's \\"futurist social model, one that is fundamentally at odds with racism, sexism, and sectarian violence\\".  Alternative sexualities  Fledgling challenges traditional expectations of sexual categorization and proposes alternative ways for individuals to relate to one another by having Ina sexual norms override human norms. Ina- human sexual relationships are polyamorous, with one Ina as the primary partner of several male and female human symbionts. Also, symbionts often engage in same-sex and/or opposite-sex relationships with other symbionts. Further, the Ina mate in family-based groups‚Äîa group of sisters mating with a group of brothers from a different family. An Ina household, therefore, blurs the boundaries between familial and erotic love by having its members involved with each other sexually. Butler highlights the strangeness of the Ina sexual arrangements through the reactions of Shori's first symbiont, Wright. According to Melissa Strong, Wright responds to Shori's pansexuality with biphobia; for him, proper sexuality has clear categories: male and female, heterosexuality and homosexuality. Ultimately, Butler's inclusion of alternative sexualities serves to erode rigid hierarchies. Strong explains that the fusing of family and sexual relations destabilizes the traditional relationship between slave and master. Similarly, Susana Morris argues that, in the spirit of Afrofuturistic feminism, Fledglings queer sexualities \\"uncouple dominance from power\\", so that the patriarchal hold over those marginalized is replaced by \\"coalition and power sharing\\".  Difference as means of survival  Fledgling is typical of Butler's work in that her protagonist's difference from the Ina norm marks her as an evolutionary step in the right direction, both in biological and in cultural terms. Biologically, her dark skin and ability to stay awake during the day allows her to save herself, her loved ones, and an entire Ina community from a series of attacks occurring during daylight. Culturally, her blackness symbolizes her closeness to humans, a trait that is portrayed as desirable for a proper Ina- human relationship. As Shari Evans explains, Shori's amnesia, which the Ina treat like a disability, in fact gives her an advantage. Her memory loss leads her to question her belief in the underlying arrangements forming Ina society that are normally left unchallenged. In addition, Shori must re-create her relationship to herself and her culture; this gives her an advantage, because she is able to decide what kind of Ina she will become with the support of her symbionts. Unburdened by cultural memory, Shori has the ability to choose what she wants to remember and how she wants to portray herself, using her own sense of morality. Likewise, Pramrod Nayar believes that Shori's loss is what makes her the best of all possible Ina, and therefore a symbol of the future. Butler proposes that vampires should become less vampiric by attaining more human qualities such as emotional attachments and sense of community. Meanwhile, humans should also lose certain aspects of themselves as well, such as their vulnerability to disease and tendency to be sexually possessive. Only by losing their weak characteristics and gaining stronger ones, the human and vampire species are able to evolve and improve. Fledgling creates a progressive plan by converting Ina and human into a companionate species through the adoption of qualities of the Other.  Agency  Fledgling explores the complexities of self-determination through its protagonist's struggle to regain control of her life and through the dependence created by Ina-human symbiosis. Shori is a typical Bildungsroman protagonist who begins with little agency and ends in charge of her life. As Florian Bast argues, Butler's novel is a typical African American narrative where the victim of a racially motivated crime is in a quest for the truth about her former self, about the agony that she has endured, and about her assailants' identity. By the end of the story, Shori has conquered both her own ignorance and the speciesist discrimination that seeks to define her thanks to her personal strength and the help of her symbionts and Ina family and friends. She is ready to become a full-fledged member of Ina society.Bast, Florian. \\"'I won't always ask.' Complicating Agency in Octavia Butler's Fledgling.\\" Current Objectives of Postgraduate American Studies 11 (2010). Shari Evans also notes that Shori's amnesia allows her to decide for herself, with the aid of her symbionts, what type of Ina she will become. In contrast, the symbiotic partnership between Ina and humans challenges traditional ways of thinking about agency, especially because the relationship is hierarchical, with the Ina as the masters of their symbionts. Wright, for example, begins the story as a free agent but his \\"happily ever after\\" ending with Shori requires that he give up some of his agency. In addition, the agency of both the Ina and the humans is restricted by biological realities, as the addictive relationship created by chemicals in the Ina saliva when they bite their symbionts cannot be undone. For the Ina, this chemical bond means they need to be in constant physical contact with their symbionts. For the symbionts, it means that they are physically dependent on their Ina, as they could die if their Ina dies, and that they are bound to follow their Ina's commands. These complications of agency, Bast argues, mean that Fledgling is \\"openly asking whether the highest degree of agency is automatically the most desirable state of being or whether there is a higher potential for happiness in choosing a specific kind of dependence\\".  Backgrounds  In an interview with Juan Gonzalez and Amy Goodman for Democracy Now!, Butler explained that she had written Fledgling as a diversion after becoming overwhelmed by the grimness of her Parable series.\\"Science Fiction Writer Octavia Butler on Race, Global Warming and Religion.\\" Interview by Juan Gonzalez and Amy Goodman. Democracy Now! 11 Nov. 2005. Web. 22 May 2015. To distract herself, she had read vampire fantasy novels, which tempted her to try writing one. As she explained in an interview with Allison Keyes, it took her a while to find the focus of the novel until a friend suggested that what vampires wanted, besides human blood, was the ability to walk in the sun. She then decided to create vampires as a separate species and have them engineer the capacity to withstand sunlight by adding human melanin to their DNA.Keyes, Allison. \\"Octavia Butler's Kindred Turns Twenty-five.\\" In Conversations with Octavia Butler. Ed. Conseula Francis. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2010. Print. Though Fledgling is unique on its take on what motivates vampires, it is not the first story to have a black vampire as its protagonist. In the 1970s, the films Blacula and Scream Blacula Scream depicted a black vampire as the nemesis of white supremacists. In the 1990s, the Blade film series, based on a Marvel Comics character, introduced a black human-vampire superhero who can tolerate sunlight. In addition, according to scholars Joy Sanchez-Taylor and Susana M. Morris, Fledgling belongs to a flourishing tradition of Afrofuturistic black vampire fiction, as represented by Jewelle Gomez's novel The Gilda Stories, as well as by the series African Immortals by Tananarive Due and The Vampire Huntress Legend by Leslie Esdaile Banks.  Reception  Fledgling received mostly positive feedback. Novelist Junot Diaz declared it his \\"book of the year\\", calling it \\"[a] harrowing meditation on dominance, sex, addiction, miscegenation and race that completely devours the genre which gave rise to it\\".Diaz, Junot. \\"Books of the Year (part Two).\\" The Guardian. 26 Nov. 2005. Web. 22 May 2015. Butler scholar Sandra Y. Govan pronounced it \\"[a]n extremely well-crafted science fiction story... [that] engages us and is exciting because it invokes and riffs upon vampire myth and legend while wearing a number of masks‚Äîmurder mystery, crime novel, coming-of-age, innocence-to- experience, initiation, quest tale, and outsider/survivor novel\\".Govan, Sandra Y. \\"Fledgling.\\" Rev. of Fledgling, by Octavia E. Butler. Obsidian III: Literature in the African Diaspora 6.2/7.1 (Fall/Winter 2005-Spring/Summer 2006): 40-43. Many critics also praised Butler's exploration of innovative and transgressive topics and themes. The New York Times declared Fledgling \\"a captivating novel that tests the limits of 'otherness' and questions what it means to be truly human.\\" Susanna Sturgis from Women's Review of Books pointed out that \\"[t]he vampire premise is perfectly suited to themes that Butler has been exploring since her earliest novels: interdependence, freedom and unfreedom, and the cost of human survival\\".Sturgis, Susanna J. \\"Living the Undead Life.\\" Rev. of Fledgling, by Octavia E. Butler. Women's Review of Books January 2006: 11. Susan Salter Reynolds of the Los Angeles Times praised Butler's ability to address controversial topics in a way that leaves the reader open to them: \\"[t]he idea of an ordinary man picking up an apparent 10-year-old girl, taking her home and having sex with her is beyond the bounds of civilized behavior. Yet somehow, Butler, with her quiet, spare language, helps us overcome this and many other cross-cultural hurdles in the book.\\"Reynolds, Susan. \\"Sweet Surrender.\\" Los Angeles Times. 27 Nov. 2005. Reviewers also commented favorably on Butler's reinvention of the vampire figure, with Ron Charles of The Washington Post arguing that \\"Fledgling doesn't just resurrect the pale trappings of vampire lore, it completely transforms them in a startlingly original story about race, family and free will.\\" While reviewing the novel for the journal Gothic Studies, Charles L. Crow noted that \\"[while] Fledgling may be the least Gothic of Butler's fictions.... Butler makes unsettling demands of the reader, as always, and we must at the beginning accept as narrator and heroine a vampire whose first act is to kill and eat a man who is trying to help her.\\" Even though many found Fledglings plot skillfully rendered and gripping, a few reviewers described the novel as slow-paced and not very engaging. Rob Gates argues that \\"Fledgling is certainly not a perfect book. The pacing in the second half of the book is quite slow at times, and the dynamics of the Ina trial did not sustain my interest well.\\" Reviewer Rachel Shimp claims that \\"Butler's sparse prose is meted out at times as painstakingly as it must feel for Shori each time she's flooded with a new memory. The slow pace of the book works with her character-in-progress, but it builds to a climax you see coming midway through. It's the only disappointing thing about Fledgling, which otherwise offers a unique vision of the modern vampire, and a kick-ass heroine to boot.\\"Shimp, Rachel, and Laura Cassidy. \\"This Week's Reads.\\" Seattle Weekly.

Some other examples of literary tone are: airy, comic, condescending, facetious, funny, heavy, intimate, ironic, light, modest, playful, sad, serious, sinister, solemn, somber, and threatening. Difference from mood Tone and mood are not the same, although they are frequently confused. The mood of a piece of literature is the feeling or atmosphere created by the work, or, said slightly differently, how the work makes the reader feel. Mood is produced most effectively through the use of setting, theme, voice and tone, while tone is how the author feels about something. Usage All pieces of literature, even official documents and technical documents, have some sort of tone. Authors create tone through the use of various other literary elements, such as diction or word choice; syntax, the grammatical arrangement of words in a text for effect; imagery, or vivid appeals to the senses; details, facts that are included or omitted; and figurative language, the comparison of seemingly unrelated things for sub- textual purposes. While now used to discuss literature, the term tone was originally applied solely to music. This appropriated word has come to represent attitudes and feelings a speaker (in poetry), a narrator (in fiction), or an author (in non-literary prose) has towards the subject, situation, and/or the intended audience. It is important to recognize that the speaker, or narrator is not to be confused with the author and that attitudes and feelings of the speaker or narrator should not be confused with those of the author. In general, the tone of a piece only refers to attitude of the author if writing is non-literary in nature.Booth, Alison, and Kelly J. Mays, eds. \\"Theme and Tone.\\" The Norton Introduction to Literature, Portable 10th ed. New York: Norton, 2010. 475-6. Print. In many cases, the tone of a work may change and shift as the speaker or narrator's perspective on a particular subject alters throughout the piece. Official and technical documentation tends to employ a formal tone throughout the piece. Setting tone Authors set a tone in literature by conveying emotions/feelings through words. The way a person feels about an idea/concept, event, or another person can be quickly determined through facial expressions, gestures and in the tone of voice used. In literature an author sets the tone through words. The possible tones are bounded only by the number of possible emotions a human being can have. Diction and syntax often dictate what the author's (or character's) attitude toward his subject is at the time. An example: \\"Charlie surveyed the classroom but it was really his mother congratulating himself for snatching the higher test grade, the smug smirk on his face growing brighter and brighter as he confirmed the inferiority of his peers.\\" The tone here is one of arrogance; the quip \\"inferiority of his peers\\" shows Charlie's belief in his own prowess. The words \\"surveyed\\" and \\"congratulating himself\\" show Charlie as seeing himself better than the rest of his class. The diction, including the word \\"snatching\\", gives the reader a mental picture of someone quickly and effortlessly grabbing something, which proves once again Charlie's pride in himself. The \\"smug smirk\\" provides a facial imagery of Charlie's pride. In addition, using imagery in a poem is helpful to develop a poem's tone.

This connection, often called a circuit, may then be leased to a customer referring to that ID. In this way, the circuit ID is similar to a serial number on any product sold from a retailer to a customer. Each circuit ID is unique, so a specific customer having many circuit connections sold to them would have many circuit IDs to refer to those connections. As an example of a use of the circuit ID, when a subscriber/customer has an issue (or trouble) with a circuit, they may contact the Controlling Local Exchange Carrier (Controlling LEC) telecommunications provider, identifying the circuit that has the issue by giving the LEC that circuit ID reference. The LEC would refer to their internal records for this circuit ID to take corrective action on the designated circuit.  Telecom circuit ID formats  Although telecommunication providers are not required to follow any specific standard for circuit IDs, many do. In the United States, LECs typically generate circuit IDs based on Telcordia Technologies' Common Language Information Services. Using the Telcordia standards for circuit naming allow a LEC the ability to build a certain amount of intelligence into the name of a circuit. The way Telcordia has developed circuit IDs, different types of circuit connections require different formats for the circuit ID. In each format, different segments of the ID have very specific meaning. At one time, abbreviations used for circuit types were meaningful (for example, HC for high capacity) but the complexity of the business no longer allows for it. Now, with many different technologies and uses for circuit connections, different types of circuits may use different types of circuit ID formats that provide more meaning for that type of circuit. Below are \\"examples\\" of how one telecommunications provider, CenturyLink, has published their choice for circuit IDs for three different types of circuit connections.  Carrier- facility format For \\"carrier circuits\\", CenturyLink uses a format like: AAAAA/BBBBBB/CCCCCCCCCCC/DDDDDDDDDDD Where: *A = Prefix: 3‚Äì5 Alphanumeric characters. This is a unique identifier. Required. *B = Facility Type: 1‚Äì6 Alphanumeric characters. Describes the \\"type\\" of facility circuit. Required. *C = CLLI Code for the A-location: 8 or 11 alphanumeric characters. Required. *D = CLLI Code for the Z-location: 8 or 11 alphanumeric characters. Required. Example: :HN101/T3U/MPLSMNDT000/GLVYMNORIII The above example circuit ID represents an unframed T3 circuit between two locations in Minnesota with a \\"serial number\\" of HN101. Some telecom providers also build a bit of intelligence (or meaning) into this unique prefix information. For instance, a T3U circuit type that carries a specific type of network traffic might use the HN designation at the beginning followed by a number in the 100-block for another specific purpose, 200-block for yet another purpose, and so on. For more on Carrier Facility formatted circuit IDs using Telcordia's standards, see Common Language Facility Identification. Serial-number format For \\"special circuits\\", CenturyLink uses a format like: AA/BBCC/DDDDDD/EEE/FFFF/GGG Where: *A = Prefix: 1‚Äì2 alphanumeric characters. Optional. *B = Service Code: 2 Characters. Required. The type of service this circuit is providing. *C = Service Code Modifier: 2 Characters. Required. Modifies the meaning of the service code, often identifies different billing options. *D = Serial Number: 1‚Äì6 digits. Required. *E = Suffix: 3 character suffix to the serial number. Optional, but rarely used. *F = Company Code: 2‚Äì4 alphabetic characters (eg. NW, MS, PN, CTL, GTEW, NRLD, UDMN, FROT...) Required. Identifies the Controlling LEC. *G = Segment: 1‚Äì3 alphanumeric characters. Optional for point-to-point circuits, but usually found with multi-point DS0 circuits. Examples: :32/HFGS/012345/NW = T3 Circuit controlled by Qwest :73/HCGS/123456/000/CC = T1 Circuit controlled by Consolidated Communications :44/AQDU/987654/000/G3 = HDSL Circuit controlled by G3 Telecom Parts of this circuit ID may also have additional intelligence (or meaning) built in. For instance, the Prefix may or may not be based on the LATA from one end of the circuit or the other. Telephone-number format For \\"telephone based data circuits\\", CenturyLink uses a format like: AA/BBCC/DDD/EEE/FFFF/GGGGG/HHH Where: *A = Prefix: 1-2 alphanumeric characters. Required if it exists. *B = Service Code: 2 alphabetic characters. Required for non-DSL numbered circuits. *C = Service Code Modifier: 2 alphabetic characters. Required. Modifies meaning of the service code, often identifies different billing options. *D = NPA: 3 digits. This is a required field. Numbering plan area code. *E = NXX: 3 digits. This is a required field. Central office (exchange) code. *F = Line: 4 digits. This is a required field. *G = Extension: 1-5 alphanumeric characters. Optional. *H = Segment: 1‚Äì3 alphanumeric characters. This is a rarely used optional field. Example: :54/UDNV/303/111/5555/99/1 = a circuit serving phone number 303-111-5555, ext. 99, on segment 1  Circuit designations in the United Kingdom  Each carrier (Public Telecomms Operator) in the UK has its own form of designation. The Post Office/BT system is described here from the original term ‚ÄòEngineering Circuit Designation‚Äô. Other PTOs have their own scheme and would be suitable for inclusion. The Post Office or BT system historically used PW and R, optionally followed by a Region and/or Area code, followed by a number of digits between 4 and 6 for rented, analogue private lines. A Region code might have been LR for London Region or ER for Eastern Region, and for an Area L/NW for North West London or CB for Cambridge. In all but the rarest instances these must have been migrated to AX by the Analogue Upgrade project to digitise as much as possible for FDM Offload, (no) dc path uniformity and remote access in maintenance. Between 2 locations then: *AX nnnnnn designates an analogue (2w or 4w) presented link. *KX nnnnnn designates a digitally presented link up to 64 kbit/s. *NX nnnnnn designates a digitally presented link from 128 up to 1,024 kbit/s. *MX nnnnnn designates a digitally presented link from 2 Mbit/s upwards Each of the prefixes may have an addition making MX/GB, KX/INT for example. There are many specialist designations covering bearers for other purposes, for example for IP and bearers provided for other PTOs. One common other use has been IMUK and IMGB for the 2 Mbit/s link from the public exchange to a customer location for the delivery of ISDN30 in the earlier DASS and more recent I.421 format. The trend has been that the local UK area suffixes are no longer used though legacy lines with these may still be in place.  International circuit designations for correspondent IPLCs  These were known as CCITT, now ITU-T, designations. In the interests of international recognition, a protocol with recognisable town names has been used. The format is: ‚Äì Towns and cities have abbreviations accepted by the 2 corresponding PTOs and the CCITT/ITU-T. Examples are: *AMS = Amsterdam *BS = Bristol *DSSD = D√ºsseldorf *FFTM = Frankfurt-am-Main *KOB = Copenhagen *L = London *MDD = Madrid *PS = Paris Original CCITT Leased Circuit Types were: Analogue P = Audio circuit (however transmitted over distance) presented as Audio for voice FP = Audio circuit (however transmitted over distance) presented as Audio for Fax modem DP = Audio circuit (however transmitted over distance) presented as Audio for Data modem XP = Audio circuit (however transmitted over distance) presented as Audio and switched by customer for alternate use by Voice or Data modem L ‚Äì PS P4 was the fourth analogue line between Paris and London normally used for voice transmission at that time. DSSD-L XP2 was the fourth analogue line between D√ºsseldorf and London alternately used for voice and data at that time. Digital NP became the Type designator for most correspondent International digital links. BS ‚Äì MDD NP12 and KOB ‚Äì PS NP34 would have been typical uses of the scheme for links between Bristol & Madrid and Copenhagen & Paris. Notes The choice of letters in designating major town and cities could be seen to reflect a short form of the name in the language of the country and also to disambiguate with similarly named locations. K√∏benhavn being the Danish home version of Copenhagen attracted KOB as the abbreviation. FFTO was the designation for Frankfurt-an- der-Oder, where there was the clear need to disambiguate references from FFTM. The serial or the numbered occurrence of a link between two PTOs between 2 cities was usually the next free number in the system, but the CCITT allowed for the re-use of old serial numbers after a period of 6 months. A customer ordering 3 links could be allocated DP23, DP24 and then DP6 between 2 major cities. (DP6 had been ceased over 6 months earlier). It can be considered that the serial or last number of the type of correspondent link between two places made the link unique but did lead to problems, for example when a major PTO in one country was setting up links in correspondent relations with more than one PTO in another country. The development was away from correspondent IPC links to a situation where one facilities provider could provide the link over the international part and sometimes as afar as the distant end customer. This was the result of liberalisation and competition in home and overseas markets. In some cases the facilities provider would carry the link to their PoP in the distant country and then rent a national or local tail from the PTO in that country. That would attract a designation particular to that area and not reflect its international connection significance.

Plot The title, literally \\"The Marionettes\\", is taken from the marionettes that are made with the main characters as models. These are used later by one of Adriana's old friends, a kindergarten teacher, to tell fairy tales to the children she teaches. It's also a metaphor, referring to the way people are obsessed with money and power which pull on them like puppet strings. In the early '60s, a relatively rich Greek man named Constantino Mykonos (Walter Kliche) and his 17-year-old daughter Artemisa (Claudia Di Gir√≥lamo) arrive in Chile. They come to the God√°n household ruled by El√≠as (An√≠bal Reyna), Constantino's cousin and childhood friend. Artemisa is immediately bullied by his cousin, the spoiled Adriana God√°n (played by Paulina Garc√≠a as a young girl and Gloria M√ºnchmayer as an adult) and her school friends. Adriana is jealous of Artemisa's beauty and charisma, and is also obsessed that no woman should surpass her, since her father looked down on her for being female. Adriana's best friend Loreto (Soledad P√©rez) is also jealous of Artemisa since her boyfriend, the aspiring writer N√©stor (Mauricio Pesutic) is starting to harbor some degree of romantic interest in her. Artemisa likes N√©stor, but also has her eyes set on Hugo (Cristi√°n Campos), the handsome and hard-working son of the Godan's housekeeper. After Adriana stages an incredibly cruel prank that includes photos of a naked Artemisa taken without her knowledge, and Constantino dies in an accident, Artemisa can't resist any more. Despite the pleas and support of her best friend Margarita (Ximena Vidal) and her husband the photographer Klaus M√ºller (Marcelo Gonz√°lez), Artemisa flees to Quito, Ecuador. Twenty years later, she returns as a cold and gorgeous socialite and businesswoman, determined to face her past. She doesn't know that Adriana, unable to let go of her own jealousy, is already planning to steal Artemisa's hard-won fortune and either send her to a North American jail on false charges or to lock her up in a mental institution. Final episode *The final episode of Los T√≠teres shows how Adriana, after all her evil plans crumble, goes completely insane and suffers a regression to her childhood as a little girl who only wished for her father's unconditional love, which was denied her because she was not a boy. At one point, Adriana jumps into a pool and starts playing with a bunch of plastic dolls, while her old and paralyzed father cries; this is the origin of the Chilean slang phrase \\"peinar la mu√±eca\\" (\\"to comb the doll\\" in English), which refers to the loss of reason. Adriana God√°n is still one of the most popular villains in Chilean telenovelas, as well as one of actress Gloria M√ºnchmayer's most popular roles ever.

It is the subject of local folklore and has been featured in local media and on Unsolved Mysteries and Mysteries at the Museum. The tracks are no longer in use, and the rails at least partially removed/covered, but it remains one of the most popular Halloween attractions in the area.Brown, Alan (2002) \\"Haunted Places in the American South\\", University Press of Mississippi, McNeil W.

(1992) \\"An Arkansas Folklore Sourcebook\\" University of Arkansas Press, Unsolved Mysteries: Gurdon Light, NBC (December 1994)Tailor, Troy (1998) \\"Haunted Arkansas: The Gurdon Light\\" The light has been ascribed various colors, ranging from blue, green or white, to orange, and has been described as bobbing around. Its exact location is said to vary and witnesses have described it appearing at various times of day or night. Folklore According to folklore, the light originates from a lantern of a railroad worker who was killed when he fell into the path of a train. The legend states that the man's head was separated from his body and was never found, and that the light that people see comes from his lantern as he searches for it. In another variation, the light is a lantern carried by railway foreman Will McClain, who was killed in the vicinity during a confrontation with one of his workers, Louis McBride in 1931. McClain believed McBride was the one who removed the spikes from a section of track, causing a freight train to derail, in an attempt to derail the Sunshine Special passenger train. Some sources say the confrontation was about how many hours McBride was allowed to work due to the Great Depression. McBride confessed to the murder and was executed by electrocution. Causes The lights are believed by some to be from passing cars on the highway in the distance (which looks like small floating lights that flash off in the distance). Some believe that it's caused by piezoelectricity from the constant stress that the area's underground quartz crystals are under. Gurdon sits above large amounts of quartz crystals and the New Madrid fault line.

The supporting cast includes Charles Clary, Doris Pawn, Jim Mason, and Claire Adams.Progressive Silent Film List: The Penalty at silentera.com Plot The Penalty As described in a film magazine, Blizzard (Chaney), a legless cripple whose cunning and criminal mind make him the master of the Barbary Coast underworld, is possessed of two ambitions. One is to get revenge upon Dr. Ferris (Clary), whose blunder during a childhood operation resulted in his legs being mistakenly amputated; the other is to rally the Reds in his organization and loot the city of San Francisco. To accomplish one Blizzard poses for the bust of Satan which is expected to be the masterpiece of Barbara Ferris (Adams), daughter of the doctor, gaining her sympathy and eventually threatening to force her marriage to him. To effect the other, he organizes the dance hall girls to work at the making of hats in a factory room at this house, the hats to be the symbol of the lawbreaking hordes when they are unleashed on the city. Rose (Terry), a detective, obtains entrance to his house as director of the factory. She is brought to love Blizzard for his passion for music. The life of the fiance of Barbara is endangered by Blizzard, who has the idea that the man's legs should be grafted on Blizzard's stumps, a second operation clears Blizzard's brain and he sees with a clear vision his fearful, terrible past, which falls away as if a dream. When happiness comes in his marriage to Rose, his former confederate Frisco Pete (Mason), a drug fiend fearful that Blizzard will reveal the identity of his gang of followers, takes the leader's life.

Chaney's knees sat in the buckets, while his lower legs were tied back. Studio doctors asked that Chaney not wear the device, but he insisted on doing so, so that his costume would be authentic. To assure audiences that Chaney was not an amputee, the original release of the film reportedly included a short epilogue clip showing Chaney out of character. This clip does not survive in the existing prints but in the movie itself, in the scene where Blizzard (Chaney) imagines his gang of anarchists carrying the loot from the Mint Building, Chaney is seen directing the heist unamputated. Preservation A print of The Penalty is in the George Eastman House Motion Picture Collection. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 80% based on , with a weighted average rating of 7.3/10. Legacy The Penalty was one of Chaney's breakout roles, showcasing his taste for the macabre and talent for contortion and disguise. He had previously demonstrated similar qualities in the previous year's The Miracle Man, but The Penalty and Treasure Island, both of 1920, secured Chaney's place as one of America's most famous character actors, before moving on to his more famous roles in 1923's The Hunchback of Notre Dame and 1925's The Phantom of the Opera. In 2009 Empire Magazine named it #17 in a poll of the 20 Greatest Gangster Movies You've Never Seen *Probably.

Prior to the massacre of B√©ziers, it was reported that Amalric, when asked how to distinguish Cathars from Catholics, responded, \\"Kill them all! God will know his own.\\" Whether this was actually said is sometimes considered doubtful.(by who?) [Citation needed] Early life He was abbot of Poblet in Catalonia from 1196 to 1198, then of Grandselve from 1198 to 1202.Tugwell, Simon. Early Dominicans. Paulist Press. . 1982. p 114-115. He then became the seventeenth abbot of C√Æteaux (until 1212). Albigensian Crusade In 1204, he was named a papal legate and inquisitor and was sent by Pope Innocent III with Peter of Castelnau and Arnoul to attempt the conversion of the Albigensians. Failing in this, he distinguished himself by the zeal with which he incited men by his preaching to the crusade against them. He was in charge of the crusader army that sacked B√©ziers in 1209. There, according to the Cistercian writer Caesarius of Heisterbach, Arnaud Amalric responded when asked by a Crusader how to distinguish the Cathars from the Catholics, > Caedite eos. Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius (Kill them. For the Lord knows > who are His.). This is the origin of the modern phrase, \\"Kill them all and let God sort them out.\\" Caesarius did not hear this statement first hand, merely writing that Arnaud was reported to have said it (dixisse fertur in the original text). p. 116 Arnaud himself, in a letter to the Pope in August 1209 (col.139), wrote: > ...dum tractatetur cum baronibus de liberatione illorum qui in civitate ipsa > catholici censebantur, ribaldi et alii viles et inermes person√¶, non > exspectato mandato principum, in civitatem fecerunt insultum, et mirantibus > nostris, cum clamaretur : Ad arma, ad arma, quasi sub duarum vel trium > horarum spatio, transcensis fossatis ac muro, capta est civitas Biterrensis, > nostrique non parcentes ordini, sexui, vel √¶tati, fere viginti millia > hominum in ore gladii peremerunt; factaque hostium strage permaxima, > spoliata est tota civitas et succensa... ...while discussions were still > going on with the barons about the release of those in the city who were > deemed to be Catholics, the servants and other persons of low rank and > unarmed attacked the city without waiting for orders from their leaders.

After this great slaughter the whole city was despoiled and > burnt...Albigensian Crusade After helping the Crusaders capture Carcassonne, he was replaced as commander of the army by Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester. However, he continued to accompany the men. On July 22, the Siege of Minerve concluded when the town's defenders agreed to surrender. Simon and the commander of the defenders, Guilhem de Minerve agreed to terms of surrender. However, Amalric, who had been absent at the time, returned to camp. He insisted that no agreements could be considered binding without the assent of himself as papal legate. Simon wished to treat the occupants leniently, but Amalric wanted them put to death. Eventually, the two worked out a solution. The Crusaders allowed the soldiers defending the town, as well as the Catholics inside of it, to leave. The Cathars who had not yet reached the status of perfect were also allowed to go free. The Cathar perfects were given the choice to return to Catholicism or face death. This solution angered many of the soldiers, who had wanted to participate in a massacre. Amalric calmed them by insisting that the majority of perfects would not recant. His prediction was correct. Only three women recanted. The remaining 140 were burned at the stake. Later life According to Mor√©ri, Arnaud was named archbishop of Narbonne about 1212, after his return from an expedition into Spain to encourage the Christians against the Moors. He left an account of this expedition. His stirring spirit embroiled him with his sovereign, Simon de Montfort. In 1224, he presided in the council of Montpellier, assembled to consider the complaints of the Albigensians. Very little is known about the life of Arnaud Amalric after 1222. History justified his absence by noting that, contrary to expectations, he took no part in the ongoing quarrels between the sons of Montfort and Raymond. On 29 September 1225, Arnaud Amalric died in Fontfroide, France.Gracias, Luke, \\"The Devil's Prayer, Australian eBook Publishers 2016, References Bibliography Secondary sources   Primary sources * Category:Albigensian Crusade Category:12th-century births Category:1225 deaths Category:French abbots Category:Cistercian abbots general Category:History of Dijon Category:Aude Category:French Cistercians Category:Archbishops of Narbonne Category:13th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:People of the Albigensian Crusade Category:Christian anti-Gnosticism Category:Armed priests ","title":"Arnaud Amalric"},{"id":"7199456","text":":For the former long-term mayor of Laredo, Texas, see J.

Martin In another deal that same offseason, the White Sox traded Tommie Agee and Al Weis to the Mets with four players (among them Tommy Davis and Jack Fisher) going to the White Sox. Martin caught Joe Horlen's no-hitter on September 10 of that 1967 season.Baseball Reference box score New York Mets In Martin, as one of two backup catchers to Jerry Grote (the other was Duffy Dyer), played on a Mets team that shockingly won the National League East title (both leagues now had two divisions after expanding from 10 teams to 12) after trailing the Chicago Cubs by as many as 10 games in August. In Game One of the first-ever NLCS, which the Mets swept over the Atlanta Braves, Martin, pinch-hitting for Tom Seaver, drove in Weis and Ed Kranepool with a base-hit off Phil Niekro during a five-run eighth inning, the Mets winning the game 9‚Äì5. The Mets went on to win the World Series in equally surprising fashion, in five games over the heavily favored Baltimore Orioles. In Game Four of that Series, his Mets leading two games to one, Martin was involved in a controversial play. With the game tied 1‚Äì1 in the bottom of the 10th and pinch-runner Rod Gaspar on second, Martin, again pinch-hitting for Seaver, bunted to the mound and, while running to first, was hit on the arm by Pete Richert‚Äôs errant throw, the error allowing Gaspar to score the winning run. Replays later showed that Martin had been running inside the baseline, which could have resulted in him being called out for interference. The umpires said they did not make the call, however, because they felt Martin did not intentionally interfere with the play. As a result of this play, the running lane that extends from halfway down the first-base line to the bag was added to all major league fields. A runner can be running in this lane and be hit by a thrown ball and not be called for interference. Chicago Cubs Martin was traded to the Chicago Cubs on March 29, for catcher Randy Bobb. After being released by the Cubs during spring training of , Martin served on their coaching staff in . He was also a White Sox broadcaster alongside Harry Caray on WSNS television in . In his career Martin batted .222 with 32 home runs and 230 RBIs in 908 games played. References External links *J. C.

It was formed in 1975 in connection with the 1976 Summer Olympics, which had venues in Ontario. Purpose and history The Tactics and Rescue Unit was formed in 1975 primarily as a counter-terrorist unit for the yachting events of the 1976 Summer Olympics, which took place off Kingston, Ontario. The first team was established on July 1 that year, with 27 OPP officers being selected for five weeks of training. The unit was originally trained by the 3rd Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment (3RCR) at Canadian Forces Base, Petawawa, Ontario, and received subsequent training and guidance from forces including the British SAS and the FBI Hostage Rescue Unit. After the Olympics, the unit was divided into five five-person teams dispersed around the province; these were consolidated into three teams in the 1980s, after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police formed two Emergency Response Teams within the province. The TRU became full-time in 1989 and became responsible for explosives disposal in Southern Ontario in the early 1990s. Tactics and Rescue Unit teams respond to high-risk calls in which violence or weapons are known or expected, including barricaded persons, K-9 back-up, prisoner escorts (where there is a high risk of escape or violence), high-risk warrant execution, witness protection, V.I.P. security and hostage rescue. Incidents when the unit has been implemented include the Ipperwash Crisis in 1995, in which a unit member shot an unarmed protester. The OPP has subsequently made changes in its response strategy and approach to First Nations groups with the objective of minimizing the use of force. Requirements and training Officers within the OPP wishing to become a member of the Tactics and Rescue Unit must have a minimum of three years' exemplary service. If chosen from their application, they then attend a two- day screening that includes a battery of written exams, psychological testing, an interview before a board, a timed physical fitness test and a firearms assessment course of fire. The fitness test consists of the applicant donning a 50 lb (23 kg) vest and travelling an overall distance of 3.2 km (2 miles) over a course corresponding roughly to the perimeter of a basketball court. Six task stations are distributed over the course. Within 32 minutes, the candidate must walk 5 laps at a brisk pace and may run 1 lap for a total of six before doing a task station. These six laps along with the six task stations must be successfully completed for the candidate to continue. The candidate may be invited to attend a nine-day selection course, which is considered one of the most difficult non-military selection courses in the world. After successfully completing all of the above requirements, the officer begins tactical training, which totals 14 weeks broken down into three levels. During this time they will learn camouflage and concealment, land navigation, K-9 back-up training, witness and VIP protection, rappeling, basic sniper, stealth clearing, and hostage rescue. If successful they then may be placed in one of the Tactics and Rescue teams, where their physical and tactical training will continue, along with opportunities for more specialized training in for example sniper, explosive disposal or rappel master.

In addition to his groundbreaking research, he assisted Rachel Carson in preparing Silent Spring. Early life and education Egler was born in New York City, growing up on Manhattan's West Side. Fifth-grade bird-watching trips to green spaces in the city instilled a love of nature in the frail boy. He went on to the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse, to pursue a career in landscape engineering, but switched to plant ecology and the University of Chicago, graduating in 1932. At Chicago, he was a student in the last course taught by Henry C. Cowles. Egler obtained his M.S. in plant ecology from the University of Minnesota in 1934, and his Ph.D. from Yale University in 1936. At Minnesota, he studied with William Skinner Cooper, joining one of the most remarkable cohorts of students ever assembled under one professor (Burgess, p. 193). It included Rexford F. Daubenmire, Murray Fife Buell, and Henry J. Oosting (who went on to become presidents of the Ecological Society of America). Egler had intended to continue under Cooper for his Ph.D., but switched to George E. Nichols and Yale, after Nichols offered him a fellowship to study the vegetation around the Egler summer home in northern Connecticut. Egler had already embarked on its study for his dissertation when Nichols made the offer. Egler liked to trace his intellectual lineage, through Cooper, to Henry Chandler Cowles. He considered Cooper to be his lifelong mentor and friend. Academic and research career Syracuse Forestry lured Egler back as a professor. His independence of mind combined with disruptions caused by World War Two resulted in his losing that position. At the war's end, Egler purchased his parents‚Äô Connecticut estate and decided to settle there to become an independent researcher and scholar. He used the proceeds of a family trust fund for support, supplementing it by grants and consulting fees. Although soured on academics by his experience at Syracuse Forestry, Egler missed having students. He taught occasionally in colleges and universities. When he began his experiments with herbicides, he realized that he needed the prestige that an academic position had once given him. From 1951-1955, he was a research associate at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. His outspokenness on the over-use of herbicides in rights-of-way led to his being asked to resign that position just before the Museum's Department of Conservation and General Ecology was disbanded. He rebounded from that setback when he was named a Guggenheim Fellow, also in 1955. Egler was a prolific writer and a prescient scientist. His 1942 paper, ‚ÄúVegetation as an Object of Study,‚Äù was among the first to attempt to apply the logic of philosophy to ecology. The same year, and more than a decade before Charles Elton's influential 1958 book on the subject, he published on invasion ecology. His 1947 study of Hawaiian vegetation is one of three papers credited with helping to finally bring down the Clementsian paradigm that so dominated American ecology to that time (McIntosh, p. 134; Simberloff, p 16). Egler's entertainingly written 1951 ‚ÄúCommentary‚Äù on American plant ecology anticipated some of the ideas of science historian and philosopher Thomas S. Kuhn. His research with herbicides was one of the earliest attempts to experimentally test a hypothesis in plant ecology. Along with his numerous descriptive studies of vegetation, his work with herbicides helped Egler demonstrate that succession did not always go through the regular stages that Frederic E. Clements had proposed, but was as often determined by the composition of seeds present after a disturbance. This was Egler's ‚ÄúInitial Floristics‚Äù model. Early conservationist Throughout his career, Egler was active in conservation work. He was a charter member of the Ecologists‚Äô Union and on the Board of Governors when it became The Nature Conservancy. An interesting aside is that the Nature Conservancy may well have become the world's most successful environmental organization because Egler was forced out of his Museum position. Contributions to Silent Spring Throughout his career, Egler urged ecologists to value applied and basic research equally in ecology. He urged ecologists to study human-stressed areas along with the pristine habitats they then preferred. He also wanted them to take active stances on environmental issues. When Rachel Carson approached him for help with Silent Spring, however, he had essentially abandoned those efforts in frustration and was no longer calling himself an ecologist. Contact with Carson energized him in his crusade to free his science from the influences of chemical manufacturers. While she was writing her book, he shared much of his experience and expertise with her, contributing long letters with comments and suggestions (Lear, p 400). A consequence was that a passage in Silent Spring having some of Egler's sarcasm received the most criticism from Ian Baldwin in his famously negative review in Science. Egler rose to defend Carson's (and his) views in a series of publications that led to his censure by the Entomological Society of America‚Äîand censure of a journal that published his views. That incident helped both to focus and to polarize the issues of professionalism and environmentalism in the science of ecology. Later career and honors In 1973-74, Egler served on the Standing Committee for Professionalism at the Ecological Society of America.List of Members of the Standing Committee on Professionalism, ESA history website, link updated 2016-03-25. In 1978, the Society gave him its Distinguished Service Award.List of awardees for Distinguished Service, ESA history website, link updated 2016-03-25. In his later years, Egler used book reviews in Ecology to keep scientists and publishers on their toes, giving praise only when he felt it was due. In his own books, he tried to develop an appreciation for good science in the lay person. Some of his works were written under the anagrammatic pseudonyms of Warren G. Kenfield (Frank Edwin Egler) and Stan R. Foote (Aton Forest). Legacy Egler's summer home in northern Connecticut has been preserved as a museum and Research Natural Area, and as a tribute to his life and work.

Career Formed in Albuquerque, New Mexico in the mid-1990s, Red Earth quickly became a local favorite and soon was playing around the Southwest, notably on numerous Indian Reservations and music festivals. True to their diverse Southwest roots, the band combines Indigenous perspectives with energetic combinations of funk, rock, heavy metal, reggae, ska, Latin music, and jazz influences. They dubbed their sound, \\"Tribal Stew.\\" The band won a Native American Music Award (or NAMMY) for their 1999 debut album, \\"When Worlds Collide\\". For the album \\"When Worlds Collide\\" they worked with Casper Lomayesva and Third Mesa Music from Phoenix, Arizona. In August 2001, the band was invited to perform in Brittany, France, as a part of the 'Chants du Monde' world music festival. They also added to their international performances by playing on several occasions across the border in Mexico. In 2000, Red Earth released a 5-song EP, Live! recorded at the Electric 49. The band spent much of 2002 and early 2003 recording their studio follow up, \\"Zia Soul\\", which found them working with Ozomatli's Wil-Dog Abers and musicians ranging from the Navajo Nation to Brazil. The album won \\"World Music Album of the Year\\" at the 6th annual Native American Music Awards in 2003. \\"Zia Soul\\" received critical acclaim around the Southwest and in Native American music circles, but it remains the band's last studio album. Throughout the years, Red Earth's line-up has changed on several occasions with the addition and departure of different members (see list). In 2004 the band was invited to perform at the opening of the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian on the Mall in Washington, DC, and the following summer was invited play in New York City at Lincoln Center Out of Doors. Leaving their mark on the New Mexico music scene, Red Earth created and organized the Electric 49, an annual concert that was held during the weekend of the annual Gathering of Nations Pow-wow in Albuquerque. The festival featured Native American rock, hip-hop, and reggae performers. The festival ran from 1998 through 2005. In 2006 the it was announced there would be no Electric 49 that year, but that the band had not broken up. With several members out of the state of New Mexico, the band has performed only sporadically since 2006. In April 2010, the band performed two reunion shows in Albuquerque during the Gathering of Nations week, and later performed two more shows in Santa Fe during Indian Market week in August. Despite members living in several states, they hope to continue performing when possible.

The Aetolians had invited Antiochus III the Great to Greece, who after his defeat by the Romans had returned to Asia. This left the Aetolians and the Athamanians without any allies. With Antiochus out of Europe the Romans and their allies attacked the Aetolians. After a year of fighting the Aetolians were defeated and forced to pay 1,000 talents of silver to the Romans.  Prelude  After the Macedonian defeat in the Second Macedonian War a dispute broke out between the Romans and the Aetolians over the terms of the treaty. The Romans had the backing of the other allies, the Pergamese and the Rhodians and the Aetolians lost the dispute.Livy, Rome and the Mediterranean The Aetolians wanted revenge and in 192 BC they sent out envoys to the King of Sparta, Nabis, King Philip V of Macedon and the Seleucid emperor, Antiochus III the Great. Nabis, who had been forced to comply with humiliating terms in 195 BC after he was defeated by Rome and the Achaean League, accepted, only to be assassinated by the Aetolians. Philip, who was still paying reparations to Rome after his defeat in the Second Macedonian War and had his son as hostage in Rome, refused the offer. Antiochus saw this as an opportunity to expand his European territory, accepted the alliance, and set out to Greece. Antiochus landed at Demetrias with 10,000 infantry and 500 cavalry and set about trying to recruit some nations into his alliances against Rome. The Romans, alarmed by Antiochus' arrival in Greece, sent the consul Manius Acilius Glabrio with an army to defeat him. The two armies met at Thermopylae, and only 500 of the Seleucids survived. After this defeat, Antiochus and the surviving part of his army returned to Asia. Rome and her allies continued to fight Antiochus in Asia Minor in the Roman‚ÄìSeleucid War.  Thessalian Campaign  This left the Aetolians and the Athamanians with no allies and the victorious Roman army marching unopposed in Thessaly. Acilius went with his army to Heraclea. Acilius sent an envoy to the Aetolian garrison in the city telling them to surrender the city and to think about seeking a pardon for their misjudgment from the Senate. The Aetolians didn't reply and the Romans began preparing to take the city by force. The Romans started the siege by assaulting the city wall with battering rams. To counter this the Aetolians made frequent sallies. The siege proved exhausting for the defenders because the Romans had a large number of men and so could replenish the front lines with fresh troops held in reserve, while the Aetolians didn't have enough soldiers to do this. After twenty-four days of fighting, the consul knew the Aetolians were exhausted from the length of the siege and from the reports that deserters had given him, and thought of a plan. At midnight he gave the signal for all the soldiers to come back to camp. When they returned to camp he kept them inactive until 3:00 am when he ordered that the siege operations begin again. The Aetolians, thinking that the Romans were also exhausted, left their posts and returned at 3am. The consul, knowing that his plan had succeeded, ordered an all-out assault from three different directions. Acilius ordered Tiberius Sempronius, who was in charge of a third of the men, to stay alert and await orders thinking the Aetolians would rush to where the shouting was heard. When the sleeping Aetolians heard the Roman army approaching they hurriedly prepared for battle and tried to make their way to the fighting in the darkness. The Romans started scaling the walls with ladders and climbing over the ruins of some the walls. As all the Aetolians rushed to where the Romans were scaling the walls, Acilius signaled for Sempronius to attack the section of the wall that was left undefended. The Aetolians, seeing Sempronius' group coming, retreated to the citadel. The consul then allowed the victorious soldiers to loot the city. When the looting finished Acilius ordered the army to be split into two groups. One group was to go around to the other side of the citadel where there was a hill of equal height so the Romans could fire missiles into the citadel from there. The other group was to attack the citadel from the front. Upon seeing the two-pronged attack, the Aetolians decided to surrender. Amongst the people that surrendered was the chief of the Aetolians, Damocritus. While the Romans were attacking Heraclea, Philip with his army and a few Romans started besieging Lamia, which was seven miles away from Heraclea. The Romans and the Macedonians displayed great energy, as if they were competing against each other. Since they were making little progress in the siege, Philip met with several of the most prominent, fearing that if the Romans captured Heraclea first, the Lamians would surrender to the Romans. Philip's fears became reality when a Roman messenger ordered him to abandon the siege.  Aetolia  The Aetolians, still hoping that Antiochus would return to Greece with a new force, sent envoys to him. The envoys were also told that if Antiochus couldn't come to Greece he should send money and reinforcements. Antiochus gave them the money to maintain the war and promised to send reinforcements. However, the fall of Heraclea broke the Aetolians' fighting spirit and they sent envoys to the Romans. The consul granted them a ten-day truce and he also sent Lucius Valerius Flaccus to parlay with the Aetolians. The Romans demanded the surrender of Dicaarchus, Monestas of Epirus and Amynander of Athamania. The Aetolians decided to obey the Romans and they sent men to collect the requested men. However, a few days later Nicander, one of the envoys who went to Antiochus, arrived back in Aetolia after having been detained by Philip of Macedon. His arrival and news that Antiochus was going to send reinforcements convinced the Aetolians to continue fighting. When Acilius heard that the Aetolians wouldn't comply with the Roman demands, he marched with his army and started to besiege Naupactus. The siege had lasted for two months when Titus Quinctius Flamininus came to Naupactus. While he was walking around the city walls he was recognised and many people flocked to the city walls and started calling on him to save them. The leading Aetolian citizens went out to meet Flamininus and they agreed that Flamininus would send an envoy to Rome to argue the Aetolians' case. The Roman army then abandoned the siege and went to Phocis. When the Aetolians returned from Rome and told the Aetolian leaders there was no hope of peace, the Aetolians seized the passage at Mount Corax so they could block off the pass. The Achaeans began ravaging the coast of Aetolia facing the Peloponnese. The Aetolians expected Acilius to attack Naupactus again but instead he launched a sudden attack on Lamia. The Lamians, despite the great confusion, managed to repulse the first attack. Acilius rallied his men and told them to only come back to camp once they had captured the city, which they did, a few hours later. The Romans, seeing that they couldn't advance to Naupactus, instead attacked Amphissa. The Romans deployed their siege engines and they successfully battered down some parts of the walls. However, the inhabitants continued to hold out until the new consul, Lucius Cornelius Scipio arrived together with his brother Scipio Africanus. Upon their arrival the inhabitants fled the city and locked themselves inside the citadel. Afterwards, Athenian envoys arrived and asked the Romans to consider making peace with the Aetolians.  Conclusion and Treaty  The Romans dictated a treaty which ultimately made Aetolia a Roman puppet state. They were to fight in any wars the Romans did, while holding the same allies and enemies, as well as the standard fines, exchange of prisoners, and the selection of hostages.Polybius, 21.32.1-15.

History and Basic Principles The group was founded in the mid 1970s by Michael Zinzun who remained an important leader and personality within the group until his peaceful death in July 2006. Zinzun and many other members of the group were former low-ranking members of the Black Panther Party. The BPP left an important, and acknowledged, aesthetic and political legacy for members of CAPA but has never been viewed uncritically. Many members of CAPA believe that the Panther's vanguardist and patriarchal organizational methods obstructed the harnessing of the power of ordinary members of the black community and left the group overly vulnerable to decapitation by the government as various leaders were killed and imprisoned. CAPA aims at empowering those it serves and has adopted the motto \\"we will work with you, not for you.\\" This means that when a person approaches CAPA with a complaint about police brutality CAPA will assist them and seek to empower the victim(s) to actively participate in their case and act as representatives to the community. CAPA had a no-guns policy, and Zinzun would not let members of the BPP bring guns to a CAPA meeting. Gang Truce CAPA, along with other organizations, has been instrumental in facilitating the LA Gang Truce and seeks to recruit gang members to redirect their energies from criminal activities that harm themselves and the community toward community activism. Allied Organizations The organization is based in South Central LA and shares its headquarters with the Peace and Freedom Party. The organizations are distinct although there is a partial overlap in membership with both sets of members often interacting and cooperating. Since the early 1980s CAPA has maintained a close relationship with the ACLU which has often provided legal assistance to the group.

Headquartered in Moscow, sells its products in Russia and overseas, and is formally known as Public Joint Stock Company Mechel.  History  Southern Kuzbass Coal Company acquired control over Chelyabinsk Steel Plant in the summer of 2002 and subsequently announced a merger of Southern Kuzbass and Mechel into Mechel Steel Group. Igor Zyuzin was elected as Chairman of the Board of Mechel Steel Group OAO in January 2004.  Mergers and acquisitions  Mechel acquired Posyet Sea Commercial Port on the Russian coast of the Sea of Japan in 2004. Mechel submitted a winning bid for a 26.9% stake in Izhstal in May 2004, subsequently increasing its stake to control. Mechel won an auction in January 2005 to buy a blocking stake (25% plus one share of stock) in Yakutugol. Also in 2005, Mechel acquired a controlling stake in Kambarka River Port.http://www.mechel.com/sector/logistics/kambarka/ In October 2006, Mechel bought control in Moscow Coke and Gas Plant.http://www.mechel.com/sector/mining/mkz/ Mechel acquired a controlling stake in Southern Kuzbass GRES OAO and Kuzbassenergosbyt power sales company in 2007. Also in 2007, Mechel added to its asset portfolio the Bratsk Ferroalloy Plant, the largest producer of high-silicon content ferrosilicon in Eastern Siberia, producing 84,000 metric tons of this material per annum, or approximately 14% of the total Russian ferrosilicon output. In May 2008, to assure a reliable in-house source of raw materials, Mechel acquired a license to develop the Uvat Quartzite. Proven and probable reserves of this site are about 7 million metric tons, but earlier estimates indicate that 3P (proven, probable, and possible reserves) of the deposit can be as high as 120 million tons. In September 2008, Mechel acquired the Mechel Temryuk Sea Port on the Taman Peninsula in the Sea of Azov. In October, Mechel won the auction to buy a controlling stake in Yakutugol, increasing its overall stake from 25% and one share to 100%. Mechel also acquired Elga Coal Field. Mechel acquired Oriel Resources Ltd in April 2008, which controls the Tikhvin Ferroalloy Plant (in Leningrad Region), the Shevchenko Nickel Deposit (in Kazakhstan) and the Voskhod Chromite Deposit (in Kazakhstan). The Tikhvin Plant has an annual projected capacity of 140,000 metric tons of ferroalloys. Mechel launched a new refinery, Mechel Chrome, at the Voskhod Deposit in September 2008, with annual capacity of approximately 900,000 metric tons of chromite concentrate per annum. Mechel signed a deal to sell the Tikhvin Ferroalloy Plant and the Voskhod Refinery to Turkey's Yildirim Group in 2013.–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –ì–æ—Ä–±—É–Ω–æ–≤ –¢—É—Ä–∫–∞–º –¥–æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª–∏—Å—å —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–µ —Ñ–µ—Ä—Ä–æ—Å–ø–ª–∞–≤—ã // –≠–∫—Å–ø–µ—Ä—Ç, ‚Ññ 33 (863), 19 –∞–≤–≥—É—Å—Ç–∞ 2013 The US$425-million deal was closed in December 2013.–ú–µ—á–µ–ª –∑–∞–∫—Ä—ã–ª —Å–¥–µ–ª–∫—É –ø–æ –ø—Ä–æ–¥–∞–∂–µ —Ñ–µ—Ä—Ä–æ—Å–ø–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã—Ö –∑–∞–≤–æ–¥–æ–≤ —Ç—É—Ä–µ—Ü–∫–æ–π Yildirim –∑–∞ $425 –º–ª–Ω // –í–µ–¥–æ–º–æ—Å—Ç–∏ 27 –¥–µ–∫–∞–±—Ä—è 2013 Mechel negotiated the acquisition of 100% in US Bluestone Coal in 2008, for an estimated US$4 billion (approximately).

Criticism from the government  Russian then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin sharply criticized Mechel management at a government meeting in Nizhniy Novgorod on July 24, 2008, which focused on ongoing troubles in the steel industry. Putin accused Mechel for exporting raw materials for steelmakers at prices about half the domestic level (which could be a sign of tax avoidance).–°–ª–æ–≤–∞ –ü—É—Ç–∏–Ω–∞ –æ ¬´–ú–µ—á–µ–ª–µ¬ª –æ–±—Ä—É—à–∏–ª–∏ —Ä—ã–Ω–æ–∫ —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∞–∫—Ü–∏–π NEWSru 26 –∏—é–ª—è 2008 –≥.

In the wake of these events, Mechel announced on August 8 that a preferred share issue, previously planned for placement on August 11, was to be postponed indefinitely. This essentially closed the door to equity finance for Mechel, restricting its financing options to debt. Vladimir Putin expressed regret over his own comments at a steel industry meeting in Chelyabinsk on July 26, 2010:  Conflicts with minority shareholders  Mechel has had numerous conflicts with minority shareholders practically from the time of its incorporation; minority shareholders have accused Mechel of disregarding their rights.

More specifically, raw iron output declined by 10%, and steel production dropped 29% year-over-year. Mechel CEO Oleg Korzhov explained this decline by the divestiture of several loss-making steel assets in 2013. Coal output declined by 1% compared to 2012.

The two countries have an extensive economic, military, and strategic relationship. Israel is represented through an embassy in New Delhi, and one consulate each in Mumbai and Bengaluru. India is represented through its embassy in Tel Aviv. India is the largest buyer of Israeli military equipment and Israel is the second-largest defence supplier to India after Russia. From 1999 to 2009, the military business between the two nations was worth around $9 billion. Military and strategic ties between the two nations extend to intelligence sharing on terrorist groups and joint military training. As of 2014, India is the third-largest Asian trade partner of Israel, and tenth-largest trade partner overall. In 2014, bilateral trade, excluding military sales, stood at US$4.52 billion. Relations further expanded during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration, with India abstaining from voting against Israel in the United Nations in several resolutions. As of 2015, the two nations are negotiating an extensive bilateral free trade agreement, focusing on areas such as information technology, biotechnology, and agriculture. According to an international poll conducted in 2009, 58% of Indians expressed sympathy with Israel, compared with 56% of Americans. History Ancient relations Geographical analysis of Israel suggests that the authors of Old Testament were talking about India, where the trade of animals such as monkeys and peacocks existed. According to Chaim Menachem Rabin, the connection between ancient Israel and the Indian subcontinent was recorded during the reign of King Solomon (10th century BCE) in I Kings 10.22. Ancient trade and cultural communication between India and the Levant is documented in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea and the accounts surrounding Queen of Sheba in the Hebrew Bible. The trade relations of both communities can be traced back to 1,000 BCE and earlier to the time of the Indus valley civilization of the Indian subcontinent and the Babylonian culture of Middle East. A Buddhist story describes Indian merchants visiting Baveru (Babylonia) and selling peacocks for public display. Similar, earlier accounts describe monkeys exhibited to the public. Trade connections between India and Palestine and Mediterranean Jewish communities continued, and later, the languages of these cultures started to share linguistic similarities. Judea played a minor role in trade between the Roman Empire and India during the period of Roman rule in Judea. It is known that there were expensive garments in the Temple in Jerusalem imported from India via Alexandria.https://faculty.biu.ac.il/~barilm/articles/publications/publications0096.html Non-recognition 1948‚Äì50 India's position on the establishment of the State of Israel was affected by many factors, including India's own partition on religious lines, and India's relationship with other nations. Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi believed the Jews had a good case and a prior claim for Israel, but opposed the creation of Israel on religious or mandated terms. India voted against the Partitioning of Palestine plan of 1947 and voted against Israel's admission to the United Nations in 1949. Various proponents of Hindu nationalism supported or sympathised with the creation of Israel. Hindu Mahasabha leader Vinayak Damodar Savarkar supported the creation of Israel on both moral and political grounds, and condemned India's vote at the UN against Israel. Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leader Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar admired Jewish nationalism and believed Palestine was the natural territory of the Jewish people, essential to their aspiration for nationhood. Informal recognition 1950‚Äì91 On 17 September 1950, India officially recognised the State of Israel. Following India's recognition of Israel, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru stated, \\"we would have [recognised Israel] long ago, because Israel is a fact. We refrained because of our desire not to offend the sentiments of our friends in the Arab countries.\\" In 1953, Israel was permitted to open a consulate in Bombay (now Mumbai). However, the Nehru government did not want to pursue full diplomatic relations with Israel as it supported the Palestinian cause, and believed that permitting Israel to open an embassy in New Delhi would damage relations with the Arab world. Jayaprakash Narayan meeting David Ben-Gurion, 1958 From India's recognition of Israel in 1950 to the early 1990s, the relationship remained informal in nature. India's opposition to official diplomatic relations with Israel stemmed from both domestic and foreign considerations. Domestically, politicians in India feared losing the Muslim vote if relations were normalised with Israel. Additionally, India did not want to jeopardise the large amount of its citizens working in Arab States of the Persian Gulf, who were helping India maintain its foreign-exchange reserves. India's domestic need for energy was another reason for the lack of normalisation of ties with Israel, in terms of safeguarding the flow of oil from Arab nations. India's foreign policy goals and alliances also proved problematic to formal relations with Israel, including India's support for the pro-Palestine Liberation Organization Non-Aligned Movement, India's tilt towards the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and India's desire to counter Pakistan's influence with the Arab states. On an ideological level, the dominant political party in India during this era, namely the Indian National Congress, opposed Israel due to their perception that it was a state based on religion, analogous to Pakistan. Although there was no formal relationship for several decades, meetings and cooperation took place between both countries, including figures such as Moshe Dayan. Israel also provided India with crucial information during its multiple wars. Rapproachment 1992‚Äìpresent After decades of non-aligned and pro-Arab policy, India formally established relations with Israel when it opened an embassy in Tel Aviv in January 1992. Ties between the two nations have flourished since, primarily due to common strategic interests and security threats. The formation of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which allegedly neglected the sentiments of Indian Muslims, and the blocking of India by Pakistan from joining the OIC are considered to be the causes of this diplomatic shift.c.f. C. Jaffrelot, op.cit.c.f. A Financial Times article. On a diplomatic level, both the countries have managed to maintain healthy relations despite India's repeated strong condemnations of Israeli military actions in Palestinian territories, which are believed by analysts to be motivated by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government's desire for Muslim votes in India. At the height of the tension between Israel and Hamas in July 2014, India offered a rhetorical condemnation holding both sides responsible for erupting violence and asked Israel to stop \\"disproportionate use of force\\" in Gaza which was read by many as departure from tradition of more vocal supports for the Palestinian cause. External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj insisted that \\"there is absolutely no change in India's policy towards Palestine, which is that we fully support the Palestinian cause while maintaining good relations with Israel. \\" clarifying India's current position on the issue. While that might sound to some like fence-sitting, it is a policy shared by all Indian governments over the past 20 years following the establishment of formal diplomatic relation in 1992. Swaraj, a seasoned parliamentarian, had herself blocked the opposition demand in Rajya Sabha for passing a resolution condemning Israel for 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict by saying that \\"India has friendly relation with both Israel and Palestine and therefore any such move may impact its friendship negatively\\". Although later in a symbolic gesture India joined others BRICS nations in voting at the United Nations Human Rights Council for a probe into the alleged human rights violation in Gaza, which generated mixed response among media and analysts in India. When the UNHRC report alleging that Israel had committed war crimes was tabled for vote, India abstained from voting, one of five countries to do so. 41 nations voted in favour, and the United States was the only vote against. Israeli envoy to India Daniel Carmon thanked India for not supporting what he described as \\"another anti Israel bashing resolution\\". India voted in favour of Israel's resolution to deny observer status to Palestinian non-governmental organization Shahed at the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) on 6 June 2019.

It was noted that Prime Minister Modi did not visit Palestine during the trip, breaking from convention. With the sole exception of Union Minister Rajnath Singh, previous trips by Indian ministers and President Mukherjee included visits to both Israel and Palestine. The Indian media described the move as the \\"dehyphenation\\" of India's relations with the two states. As a personal gesture, Israel named a new type of Chrysanthemum flower, after Narendra Modi. The media houses of both countries had termed the visit to be 'historic', where India had finally brought its relations with Israel out of the closet. During the visit, India and Israel signed 7 MoUs, which are listed as below: # MoU for setting up of India-Israel Industrial Research and Development and Technological Innovation Fund (I4F) # MoU for Water Conservation in India # MoU on State Water Utility Reform in India # India- Israel Development Cooperation ‚Äì 3-year work program in Agriculture 2018‚Äì2020 # Plan of cooperation regarding atomic clocks # MoU regarding cooperation in GEO-LEO optical link # MoU regarding cooperation in Electric Propulsion for Small Satellites India and Israel also signed an agreement, upgrading their bilateral relations to a 'strategic partnership'.

Military and strategic ties 10th President of Israel (middle) and Chief of General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces Gadi Eizenkot with Prime minister Narendra Modi New Delhi found in the Defense industry of Israel a useful source of weapons, one that could supply it with advanced military technology. Thus was established the basis of a burgeoning arms trade, which reached almost $600 million in 2016, making Israel the second-largest source of defense equipment for India, after Russia. India and Israel have increased co-operation in military and intelligence ventures since the establishment of diplomatic relations. The rise of Islamic extremist terrorism in both nations has generated a strong strategic alliance between the two. by Martin Sherman,The Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs In 2008, India launched a military satellite TecSAR for Israel through its Indian Space Research Organisation. * In 1996, India purchased 32 IAI Searcher unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), Electronic Support Measure sensors and an Air Combat Manoeuvering Instrumentation simulator system from Israel. Since then Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) has serviced several large contracts with the Indian Air Force including the upgrading of the IAF's Russian-made MiG-21 ground attack aircraft and there have been further sales of unmanned aerial vehicles as well as laser-guided bombs.India- Israel Military Ties Continue to Grow ,The Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs * In 1997, Israel's President Ezer Weizman became the first head of the Jewish state to visit India. He met with Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma, Vice President K R Narayanan and Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda. Weizman negotiated the first weapons deal between the two nations, involving the purchase of Barak 1 vertically-launched surface-to-air (SAM) missiles from Israel. The Barak-1 has the ability to intercept anti-ship missiles such as the Harpoon.The Barak Missile Deal Scandal involving graft for an unnecessary missile system would hamper relations in 2006.,The Jewish Institute for National security Affairs The purchase of the Barak-1 missiles from Israel by India was a tactical necessity since Pakistan had purchased Lockheed P-3 Orion maritime surveillance aircraft and 27 Harpoon sea-skimming anti-ship missiles from the United States. Israel was one of the selected few nations, a group that also included France and Russia, that did not condemn India's 1998 Pokhran-II nuclear tests. * In 2000, Israeli submarines reportedly conducted test launches of cruise missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads in the waters of the Indian Ocean, off the Sri Lankan coast. In naval terms, Israel sees great strategic value in an alliance with the Indian Navy, given India's naval dominance of South Asian waters and Indian Ocean at large. Due to the great importance of maritime trade to the Israeli economy it thus sees the potential of establishing a logistical infrastructure in the Indian Ocean with the help of the Indian Navy. * India purchased three Phalcon AWACS, fitted with IAI radar equipment mounted on Russian IL-76 transport aircraft, in 2003 at cost of $1 billion. * India purchased 50 Israeli drones for $220 million in 2005.India Israeli Drones www.globalsecurity.org India was considering buying the newer Harop drone.Israel negotiating Harop drone with India defense- update.com India is also in the process of obtaining missile-firing Hermes 450s. * Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd signed a US$2.5 billion deal with India in 2007 to develop an anti-aircraft system and missiles for the country, in the biggest defence contract in the history of Israel at the time.

IAI is developing the Barak 8 missile for the Indian Navy and Indian Air Force which is capable of protecting sea vessels and ground facilities from aircraft and cruise missiles. The missile has a range of over 70 kilometres. The missile will replace the current obsolete Russian system used by India. * On 10 November 2008, Indian military officials visited Israel to discuss joint weapons development projects, additional sales of Israeli equipment to the Indian military, and anti-terrorism strategies. The new round of talks was seen as a significant expansion in the Indian-Israeli strategic partnership. * Following the 2008 Mumbai attacks, Israel offered a team of about 40 special-operations forces and assistance in investigations. Tzipi Livni said: \\"If they need us we will help where needed\\". Magen David Adom dispatched a team of paramedics, medics and other professionals to assist with rescue efforts in the wake of the attacks. Israeli newspapers reported that the Manmohan Singh government turned down an offer by Defense Minister Ehud Barak to send counter-terrorist units to help fight the attackers. * In December 2009, Lt Gen Gabi Ashkenazi, Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces, made a visit to India to cement the defence ties between the two countries. He pledged every help to India in fighting terrorism. * In March 2011, it was reported that India would buy 8356 Israeli Spike anti-tank missiles, 321 launchers, 15 training simulators and peripheral equipment, for $1 billion, from Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems.

Intelligence Sharing When the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) was founded in September 1968 by Rameshwar Nath Kao, he was advised by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to cultivate links with Mossad. This was suggested as a countermeasure to military links between that of Pakistan and China, as well as with North Korea. Israel was also concerned that Pakistani army officers were training Libyans and Iranians in handling Chinese and North Korean military equipments.RAW and MOSSAD, the Secret Link,rediff.com Pakistan believed intelligence relations between India and Israel threatened Pakistani security. When young Israeli tourists began visiting the Kashmir valley in the early 1990s, Pakistan suspected they were disguised Israeli army officers there to help Indian security forces with anti-terrorism operations. Israeli tourists were attacked, with one slain and another kidnapped. Pressure from the Kashmiri Muslim diaspora in the United States led to the kidnapped tourist's eventual release. Kashmiri Muslims feared that the attacks could isolate the American Jewish community, and result in them lobbying the US government against Kashmiri separatist groups. A Rediff story in 2003 revealed clandestine links between R&AW; and Mossad. In 1996, R.K. Yadav, a former RAW official had filed a disproportionate assets case in the Delhi High Court against Anand Kumar Verma, RAW chief between 1987 and 1990. Yadav listed eight properties that he claimed were purchased illegally by Verma using RAW's unaudited funds for secret operations. Although his petition for a CBI inquiry into Verma's properties was dismissed, Yadav managed to obtain more information using in RTI in 2005 and filed another case in 2009. In 2013, the CBI carried out an investigation of Verma's properties. Proceedings in the Delhi High Court revealed the names of two companies floated by RAW in 1988 ‚Äì Piyush Investments and Hector Leasing and Finance Company Ltd. The firms were headed by two senior RAW officials V. Balachandran and B. Raman. Balachandran and Raman retired in 1994 and 1995 respectively. The companies were listed as trading houses that dealt in several kinds of minerals, automobiles, textiles, metals and spare parts, and also claimed to produce feature films. The companies purchased two flats in Gauri Sadan, a residential building on Hailey Road, New Delhi in March 1989 for 23 lakh. India Today reported that the two flats were RAW safe houses used as operational fronts for Mossad agents and housed Mossad's station chief between 1989 and 1992. RAW had reportedly decided to have closer ties to Mossad, and the subsequent secret operation was approved by then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. India Today cites \\"RAW insiders\\" as saying that RAW agents hid a Mossad agent holding an Argentine passport and exchanged intelligence and expertise in operations, including negotiations for the release of an Israeli tourist by the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front militants in June 1991. When asked about the case Verma refused to speak about the companies, but claimed his relationship with them was purely professional. Raman stated, \\"Sometimes, spy agencies float companies for operational reasons. All I can say is that everything was done with government approval. Files were cleared by the then prime minister [Rajiv Gandhi] and his cabinet secretary. Balachandran stated, \\"It is true that we did a large number of operations but at every stage, we kept the Cabinet Secretariat and the prime minister in the loop.\\" In November 2015, The Times of India reported that agents from Mossad and MI5 were protecting Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to Turkey. Modi was on a state visit to the United Kingdom and was scheduled to attend the 2015 G-20 Summit in Antalya, Turkey. The paper reported that the agents had been called in to provide additional cover to Modi's security detail, composed of India's Special Protection Group and secret agents from RAW and IB, in wake of the November 2015 Paris attacks. In 2017, India participated in the Blue Flag exercise in Uvda Air Force Base in southern Israel for the first time, where it deployed its elite and garud Commando Force and a Hercules C-130J plane from its \\"Veiled Vipers\\" Squadron. Indian and Israeli special forces conducted a range of tactical joint exercises, which included protection of strategic assets, ground infiltration and evacuation. On 14 February 2019, a convoy of vehicles carrying security personnel on the Jammu Srinagar National Highway was attacked by a vehicle- borne suicide bomber at Lethpora in the Pulwama district, Jammu and Kashmir, India. 40 Central Reserve Police Force personals were killed by the bomber. Israel responded to India, offering \\"unconditional support\\" to the Indian Army and the Government. Israel has informed that they will share intelligence and technology to help India respond. Trade The Israeli headquarters of the State Bank of India, located in Ramat Gan, Tel Aviv District Bilateral trade between India and Israel grew from $200 million in 1992 to $4.52 billion in 2014. As of 2014, India is Israel's tenth-largest trade partner and import source, and seventh-largest export source. India's major exports to Israel include precious stones and metals, organic chemicals, electronic equipment, plastics, vehicles, machinery, engines, pumps, clothing and textiles, and medical and technical equipment. Israel's imports from India amounted to $2.3 billion or 3.2% of its overall imports in 2014. Israel's major exports to India include precious stones and metals, electronic equipment, fertilisers, machines, engines, pumps, medical and technical equipment, organic and inorganic chemicals, salt, sulphur, stone, cement, and plastics. Israeli exports to India amounted to $2.2 billion or 3.2% of its overall exports in 2014. The two countries have also signed a 'Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement'. In 2007, Israel proposed starting negotiations on a free trade agreement with India, and in 2010, then Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh accepted that proposal. The agreement is set to focus on many key economic sectors, including information technology, biotechnology, water management, pharmaceuticals, and agriculture. In 2013, then Israeli Minister of Economy Naftali Bennett projected a doubling of trade from $5 to $10 billion between the two countries, if a free trade agreement was successfully negotiated. As of 2015, negotiations on a free trade agreement continue, with both countries considering negotiating a more narrow free trade agreement on goods, followed by separate agreements on trade in investment and services. Following the coronavirus pandemic, on 9 April 2020, India exported to Israel a five-ton shipment of drugs and chemicals. The consignment included ingredients for the drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. On this occasion, Sanjeev Singla, India‚Äôs ambassador to Israel stressed the bilateral ties between both the countries. It was in March 2020, that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked Modi to exempt Israel from the export ban on raw materials used to make medicines which would help in treating the patients affected with coronavirus. The 10 major commodities exported from India to Israel were: # Gems, precious metals and coins: $973.6 million # Organic chemicals: $296.5 million # Electronic equipment: $121.2 million # Medical, technical equipment: $59.3 million # Plastics: $56.4 million # Vehicles: $44.4 million # Machinery: $38.1 million # Other textiles, worn clothing: $31.8 million # Knit or crochet clothing: $31.6 million # Clothing (not knit or crochet): $30.8 million Israeli exports to India amounted to $2.3 billion or 3.8% of its overall exports in 2015.

Specific areas of cooperation included information technology, biotechnology, lasers, and electro-optics. Additionally, a joint committee to monitor collaboration between the two nations was established and set to meet biennially. In 1994, a $3 million joint science and technology fund was set up to facilitate R&D; collaboration between both countries. In 1996, Indian scientists attended a seminar on advanced materials in Israel. In 1997, Israeli scientists attended a seminar on biotechnology in Delhi. In 1998, India and Israel had 22 ongoing joint research projects. A joint symposium on the human genome was held in Jerusalem, where six Indian scientists took part. In November 1999, India and Israel agreed on four proposals for joint research projects in the field of human genome research. In 2000, even more joint projects related to human genome research were agreed on, and a status seminar on this field was held in India. In early 1999, more than 20 Israeli scientists participated in a physics symposium on condensed matter in Delhi. In 2001, a similar symposium was held in Jerusalem, with 18 Indian scientists attending. In 2003, both countries discussed doubling their investment in their ongoing science and technology collaboration to $1 million each, starting in October 2004. In 2005, India and Israel signed a memorandum of understanding to set up a fund to encourage bilateral investment into industrial research and development and specific projects. Under the agreement, at least one Indian and one Israeli company must be collaborating on a project for that project to qualify for the fund. From 2006 to 2014, the fund, named i4RD, has been used in seven projects. In 2012, the two countries signed a five-year $50 million academic research agreement for promoting collaborative research across a wide range of disciplines, including medical and information technology, social and life sciences, humanities, and the arts. In 2012, Israel stated its intent to increase technological and economic cooperation with the Indian state of Bihar, in the fields of agriculture, water management, solar energy, and medical insurance. In 2014, Israel made plans to open two agricultural centers of excellence in Bihar, focusing on increasing productivity of vegetable and mango crops. Israel has offered to help the India government with a project to clean the Ganga. An Israeli delegation visited India in August 2015 and met with officials of the Union Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation. Israeli Ambassador to India Daniel Carmon also called on Union Urban Development and Parliamentary Affairs Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu to offer Israel's expertise in water management to battle water scarcity. Ohad Horsandi, spokesperson of the Israeli Embassy in New Delhi stated that Israel was keen to help in India meet its water needs for agriculture and drinking, and was pushing for more government-to-government agreements. Following Prime Minister Modi's visit to Israel in 2017, there has been an increased call for collaboration between Israel and India on innovation development. The non- profit Indian based global trade body, NASSCOM, along with the professional service company, Accenture, released the report Collaborative Innovation: The Vehicle Driving Indo-Israel Prosperity, to highlight areas of scientific and technological collaboration between the two countries. Additionally, the non- profit organization TAVtech Ventures is launching a program that connect students from Israel and the United States with local Indian students to come up with tech-based startups. Space collaboration In 2002, India and Israel signed a cooperative agreement promoting space collaboration between both nations. In 2003, the Israel Space Agency, or ISA, expressed interest in collaborating with the Indian Space Research Organisation, or ISRO, in using satellites for improved management of land and other resources. Israel also expressed interest in participating in ISRO's proposed mission of sending an unmanned craft to the moon. Additionally, the two countries signed an agreement outlining the deployment of TAUVEX, an Israeli space telescope array, on India's GSAT-4, a planned navigation and communication satellite. In 2010, the TAUVEX array was removed from GSAT-4 by the ISRO, and the array was never subsequently launched. The GSAT-4 itself failed to launch, due to the failure of its cryogenic engine. In 2005, Israel decided to launch TecSAR, its first synthetic aperture radar imaging satellite, on India's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, or PSLV. TecSAR was chosen to launch through India's PSLV due to Israeli concerns about the reliability and technical limitations of its own Shavit space launch vehicle, economic considerations, and also due to Israel's desire to increase strategic cooperation with India. In 2008, TecSAR was successfully inserted into orbit by India's PSLV. One of TecSAR's primary functions is to monitor Iran's military activities. In 2009, India successfully launched RISAT-2, a synthetic aperture radar imaging satellite. RISAT-2 was manufactured by Israel Aerospace Industries, or IAI, in conjunction with ISRO. The launch of the RISAT-2 satellite aimed to provide India with greater earth observation power, which would improve disaster management, and increase surveillance and defense capabilities. The acquisition and subsequent launch of the RISAT-2 satellite was accelerated after the 2008 Mumbai attacks, to boost India's future surveillance capabilities. Agriculture cooperation India has chosen Israel as a strategic partner (G2G) in the field of agriculture.This partnership evolved into the Indo-Israel Agricultural Project (IIAP), under the Indo Israel Action Plan, based on a MOU signed by Indian and Israeli ministers of Agriculture in 2006. The partnership aim to introduce crop diversity, increasing productivity & increasing water use efficiency. IIAP has been initiated in 2009 after signing a bilateral agreement between Indian and Israeli ministers of Agriculture (2006). IIAP is implemented via establishment of Centers of Excellence (CoE), in which Israeli Technologies and know-how are disseminated tailored to local Indian conditions. Till date three phases of IIAP has been channeled. Each IIAP phase lasts for three years (2009‚Äì2012; 2012‚Äì2015, 2015‚Äì2018).Within the 16 States that has been invited to take part in the IIAP, 22 CoE‚Äôs are currently into the fully active stage. Acknowledging the success of MIDH MASHAV IIAP Program as implemented during the last decade a three year work program in Agriculture‚Äù 2018‚Äì2020 was signed between the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmer‚Äôs Welfare of the Republic of India and MASHAV\\\\- Ministry of Foreign Affairs Israel to increase the value chain demonstrated with the fully operative Indo-Israel Center of Excellence by introducing new components including the Indo-Israeli Centre of Excellence for Animal Husbandary & Dairying, Hisar. Center of Excellence (CoE) is a platform for knowledge transfer and Israeli Agro-Technology. As a goal the CoE aims to serve the farmer with a focus on a key crop. Each CoE is composed of Nursery management, Cultivation techniques, and Irrigation and fertigation. Also in 2008, Israel and India finalised an agricultural plan introducing crops native to the Middle East and Mediterranean to India, with a particular focus on olives. Subsequently, around 112,000 olive trees were planted in the desert of Rajasthan. In 2014, more than 100 tonnes of olives were produced in Rajasthan. Oil and natural gas cooperation With the recent discovery of the Tamar and Levianthan gas fields off the coast of Israel, India has been one of the first countries to bid for an exploration license in order to extract and import natural gas from the Jewish State. India's ONGC Videsh, Bharat PetroResources, Indian Oil and Oil India were awarded an exploration license by the Israeli government, a clear sign of the ongoing diversification in ties between the two countries.  Cultural ties and cross-country perceptions  In 2011, cultural artists and performers from India arrived in Israel to participate in a three-week festival commemorating 20 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries. According to India's then Ambassador to Israel Navtej Sarna, the purpose of the festival was to improve the bilateral relationship between the two countries by facilitating a greater understanding of each other's culture. According to a 2009 international study commissioned by the Israeli Foreign Ministry, the greatest level of sympathy towards Israel can be found in India, with 58% of Indian respondents showing sympathy towards Israel. As reported in 2015, opinion polls taken in India showed 70% and above of respondents had favorable views of Israel. In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly voted unanimously in favour of adopting June 21 as International Yoga Day. In a clear sign of growing affinity between the two countries, the Indian Embassy in Tel Aviv organizes annual yoga day celebrations, where Israelis from all walks of life take part in various yogic exercises. Yoga has proven to be immensely popular in Israel and is a sign of Israel's cultural connection to India. Tourism A Hebrew sign in Kasol, Himachal Pradesh, India Around 40,000 Israelis, many of whom have just finished military service, visit India annually. There are dozens of Chabad- operated community centers in India, where many Israelis celebrate holidays and observe religious traditions. Popular destinations for Israelis include Goa, the Himalayas, Old Manali, Vashisht, Naggar, Kasol, and the villages surrounding Dharamsala. In many of these areas, Hebrew signs on businesses and public transportation are widely noticeable. The number of tourists from India visiting Israel touched 15,900 in the year 2000. By 2010, the number of tourists had increased to 43,439. In 2014, the number of tourists from India visiting Israel was 34,900. A popular destination for Indian tourists traveling to Israel is Jerusalem. In part of 2010, Indian tourists were the biggest spenders in Israel, spending an average of $1,364 per tourist; the average tourist expenditure in Israel during this time was $1,091. In 2011, representatives from both countries met in Delhi, and planned to enhance tourism through collaboration in the spheres of destination management and promotion, as well as in manpower development. Plans for tour-operators and travel agents in both countries to coordinate were also discussed. In 2015, 600 travel agents from India arrived in Israel for the annual Travel Agents Federation of India conference, and ways to decrease barriers to tourism were discussed. Currently El AL Airlines flies between Tel Aviv and Mumbai, Air India flies between Delhi and Tel Aviv and Arkia flies between Tel Aviv and Kochi as well as Tel Aviv and Goa. In March 2018, Air India, operating flight number AI139, became the first airline to fly non-stop from New Delhi to Tel Aviv, via the airspace of Saudi Arabia, overturning an overfly ban on flights to Israel that had lasted 70 years. Currently, Air India is the only airline in the world that has been given such permission, and indicates a behind-the- scenes improvement in relations between Israel and the Arab world. The new flight takes approximately 7 hours to traverse the distance between India and Israel, which is 2 hours and 10 minutes shorter than the route taken by EL AL from Mumbai to Tel Aviv. In recent days, the success of the route has prompted the airline to increase the frequency of flights to one each day. In recent months, Israel has observed a constant rise in the number of Indian tourists to the country. Towards an additional effort to boost tourism from India, the Israeli government has simplified visa procedures for Indians who have already availed visas from either Canada, Australia, United States, Schengen countries or Israel and have completed their travel to these countries. Visa processing fees for Indian applicants has also been reduced from the original 1700 to 1100. In the year 2017, Indian tourist arrivals to Israel rose by 31%, with over 60,000 tourists visiting the country that year.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-tourist-arrivals-to- israel-increases-by-record-breaking-31-in-2017/articleshow/62708938.cms Israel plans to meet a target of over 100,000 Indian tourists for the year 2018. Interfaith relations In February 2007, the first Jewish-Hindu interfaith leadership summit was held in New Delhi. The summit included the then Chief Rabbi of Israel Yona Metzger, the American Jewish Committee's International Director of Interreligious Affairs David Rosen, a delegation of chief rabbis from around the world, and Hindu leaders from India. During the summit, Rabbi Metzger stated that \\"Jews have lived in India for over 2,000 years and have never been discriminated against. This is something unparalleled in human history.\\" In August 2007, amidst protests, a delegation of Indian Muslim leaders and journalists traveled to Israel. The visit was touted as a dialogue of democracies, and was organised by the American Jewish Committee's India office. During this trip, Maulana Jameel Ahmed Ilyasi, the then secretary- general of the All-India Association of Imams and Mosques, praised the mutual respect Israeli Arabs and Israeli Jews have for each other, and encouraged resolving problems by dialogue rather than violence. Muslim leaders met with then president Shimon Peres, where Peres highlighted the coexistence of religions in Jerusalem and India's struggle with terror and separatism. In 2008, a second Hindu-Jewish summit took place in Jerusalem. Included in the summit was a meeting between Hindu groups and then Israeli President Shimon Peres, where the importance of a strong Israeli-Indian relationship was discussed. The Hindu delegation also met with Israeli politicians Isaac Herzog and Majalli Wahabi. Hindu groups visited and said their prayers at the Western Wall, and also paid their respects to Holocaust victims. In 2009, a smaller Hindu-Jewish interfaith meeting organised by the Hindu American Foundation and the American Jewish Committee was held in New York City and Washington. Hindu and Jewish representatives gave presentations, and participants wore lapel pins combining the Israeli, Indian, and American flags. In November 2012, Israeli President Shimon Peres remarked, \\"I think India is the greatest show of how so many differences in language, in sects can coexist facing great suffering and keeping full freedom.\\" In 2019, a large scale summit to further boost Hindu-Jewish cultural ties was organized by Indo-Israel Friendship Association in Mumbai.

Carthage's economic success and its dependence on seaborne trade led to the creation of a powerful navy to discourage both pirates and rival nations. They had inherited their naval strength and experience from their forebearers, the Phoenicians, but had increased it because, unlike the Phoenicians, the Punics did not want to rely on a foreign nation's aid. This, coupled with its success and growing hegemony, brought Carthage into increasing conflict with the Greeks, the other major power contending for control of the central Mediterranean. The Greeks, like the Phoenicians, were expert sailors who had established thriving colonies throughout the Mediterranean. These two rivals fought their wars on the island of Sicily, which lay close to Carthage. From their earliest days, both the Greeks and Phoenicians had been attracted to the large island, establishing a large number of colonies and trading posts along its coasts. Small battles had been fought between these settlements for centuries. No Carthaginian records of the war exist today because when the city was destroyed in 146 BC by the Romans, the books from Carthage's library were distributed among the nearby African tribes. None remain on the topic of Carthaginian history. As a result, most of what we know about the Sicilian Wars comes from Greek historians. Background The Phoenicians had established trading posts all over the coast of Sicily after 900 BC, but had never penetrated far inland. They had traded with the Elymians, Sicani and Sicels and had ultimately withdrawn without resistance to Motya, Panormus and Soluntum in the western part of the island when the Greek colonists arrived after 750 BC.Thucydides VI.2.6 These Phoenician cities remained independent until becoming part of the Carthaginian hegemony some time after 540 BC.Freeman, Edward A., History of Sicily, Volume 1, pp. 283‚Äì297 ‚Äì public domain book Carthaginian hegemony Carthage created its hegemony in part to resist Greek encroachments in the established Phoenician sphere of influence. Phoenicians initially (750‚Äì650 BC) did not resist the Greek colonists, but after the Greeks had reached Iberia sometime after 638 BC, Carthage emerged as the leader of Phoenician resistance. During the 6th century BC, mostly under the leadership of the Magonid dynasty, Carthage established an empire which would commercially dominate the western Mediterranean until the 2nd century BC.Markoe, Glenn E., \\"Phoenicians\\", pp. 54‚Äì55 The Phoenicians in Sicily and the Elymians had united to defeat the Greeks of Selinus and Rhodes near Lilybaeum in 580 BC, the first such recorded incident in Sicily. The next known Greek incursion took place 70 years later. Greek settlement The Greek-colonized zone encompassing Sicily and southern Italy came to be known as Magna Graecia. The Greeks living in this area behaved pretty much like the mainland Greeks, expanding their political and commercial domain at the expense of their neighbors while keeping the feud between the Ionians and the Dorians alive. In Sicily, the Ionian Greeks on the whole had friendly relations with native Sicilians and the Phoenicians, but the Dorian Greek colonies were comparatively more aggressive, expanding inland from the coast at the expense of the natives to expand their domain. Conflicts among the Greek colonies and between the natives and Greeks had erupted, but these were mostly localized affairs. Trade also flourished between the natives, the Greeks and the Phoenicians, and the Greek colonies became prosperous. This prosperity enabled some of the Greek cities to start to expand their territories again, ultimately leading to the events known as the First Sicilian War. Carthage joins the fight The Carthaginian Malchus is said to have \\"conquered all Sicily\\" and sent captured booty to Tyre some time after 540 BC, which probably meant that Motya, Panormus and Solus had fallen under Carthaginian control. The growth of Selinus and Himera during this period indicates the Carthaginians and Greeks did not confront one another at this time. Thirty years later Prince Dorieus, having lost the Spartan throne, showed up to colonize Eryx ‚Äì after being expelled from Libya by Carthage in 511 BC following a three-year struggle. Carthage aided Segesta to defeat the expedition of Dorieus in 510 BC ‚Äì Greek survivors then founded Heraclea Minoa.Diodorus Siculus IV.23 Sicilian Greeks (probably the cities of Akragas, Gela and Selinus) fought an undated war of revenge against Carthage, which led to the destruction of Minoa and a treaty which brought economic benefits for the Greeks.Freeman, Edward A., History of Sicily, Volume 2, p. 97-100 An appeal for aid to avenge the death of Dorieus was ignored by mainland Greece, even by the brother of Dorieus Leonidas of Sparta, famous for his role at Thermopylae in 480 BC. This episode possibly demonstrated the futility of opposing Carthage by single Greek citiesBaker, G.P., Hannibal, p. 15 or the unreliability of aid from mainland Greece, a situation that would change with the rise of the Greek tyrants in Sicily. Two Greeks from Gela, Cleander and Gelo, had been involved in this war and they would become the catalysts of the events that followed. Sicilian Greek tyrants While the events in western Sicily played out and Carthage remained engaged in Sardinia, most of the Greek colonies in Sicily fell under the rule of tyrants. The tyrants of Gela, Akragas and Rhegion, successfully expanded their respective dominions at the expense of native Sicilians and other Greek cities between 505 and 480 BC, with the Dorian city of Gela being the most successful. Dorian Greeks become dominant in Sicily Cleander of Gela (505-498 BC) and his brother Hippocrates (498-491) successfully took over both Ionian and Dorian Greek territory, and by 490 BC, Zankle, Leontini, Catana, Naxos, besides neighboring Sicel lands and Camarina had fallen under Gelan control. Gelo, successor of Hippocrates, captured Syracuse in 485 BC and made the city his capital. By using ethnic cleansing, deportation and enslavement,Freeman, Edward A., History of Sicily, Volume 2, pp. 130-31 ‚Äì public domain book Gelo transformed the former Ionian cities into Dorian ones and made Syracuse the dominant power in Sicily. Meanwhile, Akragas had successfully taken over Sikan and Sicel lands under the tyrant Theron of Acragas (488-472 BC). To forestall any conflicts between Akragas and Syracuse, Gelo and Theron married into each other's families, creating a united front against the Sicels and Ionian Greeks of Sicily. The major part of the resources and manpower of Greek Sicily was thus concentrated in the hands of these two aggressive tyrants, a threat to all other Sicilian powers. Ionian Greeks call on Carthage To counter this Doric threat, Anaxilas of Rhegion from Italy, who had captured Zankle from Gelo in 490 BC, allied himself with Terrilus, the tyrant of Himera, and married his daughter.Herodotus, VII.163 Himera and Rhegion next became allies of Carthage, the nearest foreign power strong enough to provide support. Selinunte, a Doric city whose territory bordered Theron's domain, also became a Carthaginian ally ‚Äì perhaps the fear of Theron and the destruction of Megara Hyblaea (mother city of Selinus) by Gelo in 483 BC, had played a part in this decision. Thus, three blocs of power were delicately balanced in Sicily by 483 BC ‚Äì Ionians dominating the north, Carthage the west, Dorians the east and south. The Sicels and Sikans, sandwiched in the middle, remained passive, but the Elymians joined the Carthaginian alliance. The First Sicilian War (480 BC) Romanticised representation of the Battle of Himera (480 BC). Carthage responded to the call for aid by Terrilus, tyrant of Himera, after Theron deposed him in 483 BC to set up an expedition to Sicily. Carthage could not ignore this imminent threat because the Gelo-Theron alliance was about to take over the whole of Sicily, and Hamilcar was a guest friend of Terrilus. Carthage may have also chosen this time to attack because a Persian fleet attacked mainland Greece in the same year. The theory that there was an alliance with Persia is disputed, because Carthage neither liked foreign involvement in their wars, nor wanted to contribute to foreign wars, unless they had strong reasons to do so. But because control of Sicily was a valuable prize for Carthage and because Carthage fielded its largest military force to date, under the leadership of the general Hamilcar, Carthage was eager for war. Traditional accounts give Hamilcar's army a strength of 300,000 men; this number seems unlikely because, even at its peak, the Carthaginian Empire would have only been able to muster a force of about 50,000 to 100,000 men. If Carthage had allied with Persia, they might have supplied Carthage mercenaries and aid, which the Persians undoubtedly had, but there is no evidence to support this cooperation between the Carthaginians and the Persians. En route to Sicily, the Punic fleet suffered losses, possibly severe, due to poor weather. After landing at Ziz, the Punic name for Panormus, modern-day Palermo, Hamilcar was then decisively defeated by Gelo at the Battle of Himera, which was said to have occurred on the same day as the Battle of Salamis.Herodotus, 7.166 Hamilcar was either killed during the battle or committed suicide in shame. The loss caused changes in the political and economic landscape of Carthage, the old government of entrenched nobility was ousted, replaced by the Carthaginian Republic. The king still remained, but he had very little power and most power was entrusted to the Council of Elders. Carthage paid 2,000 talents as reparations to the Greeks, and did not intervene in Sicily for 70 years. In Sicily, Carthage lost no territory and the Greeks gained none. Syracuse did not attack Rhegion or Selinus, allies of Carthage. The booty from the war helped to fund a public building program in Sicily, Greek culture flourishing as a result. Trading activity saw the prosperity of the Greek cities increase and the wealth of Akragas began to rival that of Sybaris. Gelo died in 478 BC and, within the next 20 years, the Greek tyrants were overthrown and the Syracuse-Akragas alliance fragmented into 11 feuding commonwealths under oligarchs and democracies. Their bickering and future expansionist policies led to the Second Sicilian war. The Second Sicilian War (410 BC‚Äì404 BC) While the Greek cities in Sicily bickered and prospered for 70 years after Himera, Carthage had conquered the northern fertile half of modern-day Tunisia, and strengthened and founded new colonies in North Africa, such as Leptis and Oea, modern Tripoli. Carthage had also sponsored the journey of Mago Barca (not to be confused with Mago Barca, Hannibal Barca's brother) across the Sahara Desert to Cyrenaica, and Hanno the Navigator's journey down the African coast. The Iberian colonies had seceded in that year with the help of the Iberians, cutting off Carthage's major supply of silver and copper. In Sicily, Dorian-Greek Selinus and Ionian-Greek (former Elymian) Segesta renewed their rivalry. Selinus encroached on Segestan land and defeated the Segestians in 416 BC. Carthage turned down their plea for help, but Athens responded to the Segestan plea and the Sicilian Expedition sent by Athens was destroyed in 413 BC by the joint effort of the Sicilian cities with Spartan aid. Selinus again defeated Segesta in 411 BC. This time Segesta submitted to Carthage, and a Carthaginian relief force sent by Hannibal Mago helped Segesta defeat Selinus in 410 BC. Carthage sought to end the matter diplomatically while assembling a larger force. After a round of diplomacy involving Carthage, Segesta, Selinus, and Syracuse failed to bring about a reconciliation between Segesta and Selinus, Hannibal Mago set out for Sicily with a larger force. He succeeded in capturing Selinus after winning the Battle of Selinus, then destroyed Himera after winning the Second Battle of Himera despite Syracusan intervention. Hannibal did not press on to attack Akragas or Syracuse, but returned triumphantly to Carthage with the spoils of war in 409 BC. While Syracuse and Akragas, the strongest and richest cities of Sicily, took no action against Carthage, the renegade Syracusan general Hermocrates raised a small army and raided Punic territory from his base Selinus. He managed to defeat the forces of Motya and Panormus before losing his life in a coup attempt in Syracuse. In retaliation Hannibal Mago led a second Carthaginian expedition in 406 BC. This time the Carthaginians met with fierce resistance and ill-fortune. During the Siege of Akragas the Carthaginian forces were ravaged by plague, and Hannibal Mago himself succumbed to it. Himilco, his successor, captured and sacked Akragas, then captured the city of Gela, sacked Camarina and repeatedly defeated the army of Dionysius I, the new tyrant of Syracuse. The plague struck the Carthaginian army again, and Himilco agreed to a peace treaty that left the Carthaginians in control of all the recent conquests, with Selinus, Thermae, Akragas, Gela and Camarina as tributary vassals. Carthaginian power was at its peak in Sicily. The Third Sicilian War (398 BC‚Äì393 BC) By 398 BC, Dionysius had consolidated his strength and broke the peace treaty, commencing the Siege of Motya and capturing the city. Himilco responded decisively, leading an expedition which not only reclaimed Motya, but also captured Messina.Ancient catapult used in the siege of MotyaFinally, he laid siege to Syracuse itself after decisively defeating the Greeks in the naval Battle of Catana. The siege met with great success throughout 397 BC, but in 396 BC plague again ravaged the Carthaginian forces, and they collapsed. Carthage lost her new Greek conquests but retained control over the western territories and the Elymians. No treaty was signed between the belligerents to signal the end of the war. Dionysius soon rebuilt his power and sacked Solus in 396 BC. He was engaged in eastern Sicily during 396-393 BC, including the Siege of Tauromenium (394 BC). At this time, Carthage was occupied in Africa dealing with a rebellion. In 393 BC, Mago, successor of Himilco, led an attack on Messina, but was defeated near Abacaenum by Dionysius. Reinforced by Carthage, Mago led another expedition through central Sicily, but ran into trouble near the River Chrysas. Dionysius also faced difficulties of his own, and a peace treaty was concluded that basically ensured Carthage and Syracuse left each other alone in their respective spheres of influence. The Fourth Sicilian War (383 BC‚Äì376 BC) Dionysius opened hostilities again in 383 BC. Mago allied with the Italiot league led by Taras and landed in force at Bruttium, forcing Syracuse into a two front war. Details of the first four years of campaigns are sketchy, but in 378 BC Dionysius defeated Mago in Sicily in the Battle of Cabala. Carthage, also faced with rebellions in Africa and Sardinia, sued for peace. Dionysius asked Carthage to evacuate all Sicily, so war was again renewed, and Himilco, son of Mago, destroyed the Syracusan army at the Battle of Cronium in 376 BC. The subsequent peace treaty forced Dionysius to pay 1000 talents as reparations and left Carthage in control of Western Sicily. The Fifth Sicilian War (368 BC‚Äì367 BC) Dionysius again attacked Punic possessions in 368 BC, and laid siege to Lilybaeum. The defeat of his fleet was a severe setback. After his death in 367 BC, his son Dionysius II made peace with Carthage, and Carthage retained her Sicilian possessions west of the Halcyas and Himeras rivers. The Sixth Sicilian War (345 BC‚Äì341 BC) Carthage became embroiled in Syracusan politics in 345 BC, and her forces managed to enter the city at the invitation of one of the political contenders. The commander Mago bungled the affair, retreated to Africa and killed himself to escape punishment. Timoleon assumed power in Syracuse in 343 BC and started raiding Carthaginian possessions in Sicily. The Carthaginian expedition to Sicily was destroyed in the Battle of the Crimissus in 341 BC. The following peace treaty left Carthage in control of territories west of the Halcyas river.  The Seventh Sicilian War (311 BC‚Äì306 BC) In 315 BC Agathocles, the tyrant of Syracuse, seized the city of Messana, present-day Messina. In 311 BC, he invaded the last Carthaginian holdings on Sicily, which broke the terms of the current peace treaty, and he laid siege to Akragas. Hamilcar, grandson of Hanno the Navigator, successfully led the Carthaginian counterattack. He defeated Agathocles in the Battle of the Himera River in 311 BC. Agathocles had to retreat to Syracuse while Hamilcar won control over the rest of Sicily. In the same year, he laid siege to Syracuse itself.Carthaginian hoplite (4th century BC) In desperation, Agathocles secretly led an expedition of 14,000 men to the mainland of Africa, hoping to save his rule by leading a counterstrike against Carthage itself. In this, he was successful: Carthage was forced to recall Hamilcar and most of his army from Sicily to face the new and unexpected threat. The two armies met in the first Battle of White Tunis outside Carthage. The Carthaginian army, under Hanno and Hamilcar, was defeated. Agathocles and his forces laid siege to Carthage, but it was too strongly fortified for them to assault. Instead, the Greeks slowly occupied the whole of northern Tunisia until they were defeated two years later in 307 BC. Agathocles himself escaped back to Sicily and negotiated a peace treaty with the Carthaginians in 306, in which Agathokles retained control of the eastern half of the island. Pyrrhic War (278 BC‚Äì276 BC) After Agathocles sued for peace, Carthage enjoyed a brief, unchallenged period of control of Sicily, which ended with the Pyrrhic War. The Sicilian Pyrrhic expedition, the second phase of the Pyrrhic War (280-265 BC), which ultimately led to the Punic Wars, can be considered the ultimate part of the Greek-Punic wars. Pyrrhus of Epirus arrived in Sicily to rescue the island from the Carthaginians. He conquered Palermo, Eryx and Iaitias but his siege of Lilybaeum failed. So he returned to Italy. Rome, despite its close proximity to Sicily, was not involved in the Sicilian Wars of the 5th and 4th centuries BC because of its focus on local conflicts in Latium during the 5th century BC and its conquest of Italy proper during the 4th century BC. Rome's later involvement in Sicily ended the indecisive warfare on the island.

At that time LeDrew claimed this action against him was incited by his stand against Jean Chr√©tien's efforts to remain as party leader without a leadership review vote, contrary to the constitution of the Liberal Party of Canada. LeDrew owed C$364,140 in back taxes, which he had been in the process of paying down. The court ordered him to pay 74% of this amount, even though LeDrew had earlier offered to pay 100% of his arrears over time; the government had rejected this offer. The judge on the case noted that LeDrew placed priority on personal expenses rather than his tax obligations.https://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c;=Article&cid;=1159480211102 LeDrew stated in reply at the time that his children and their needs came first, and he would not have done anything differently.

Mathews (2 May 1850 ‚Äì 20 November 1947) was an American architect based in Oakland, California. He was a native of Markesan, Wisconsin. He is best known for designing the First Unitarian Church of Oakland and the Oakland mansion of Frank M. \\"Borax\\" Smith. His father, Julius C. Mathews, was also an architect. The family moved from Wisconsin in 1866, and Walter and his brothers trained in the office of their father. He joined his father's office in 1874-75, then spent a few years in Los Angeles, where he became a partner with architect Ezra F. Kysor in the firm Kysor & Mathews. Among the Los Angeles projects he collaborated on with Kysor were the Cathedral of Saint Vibiana and Childs' Grand Opera House, which was later to become the first Los Angeles venue of the Orpheum vaudeville circuit. Mathews returned to Oakland in 1877, becoming a partner in his father's firm until establishing his own practice in Oakland in 1886.Joseph E. Baker, editor, Past and Present of Alameda County, California. Chicago: S. J. Clarke (1914) p. 457 In the 1890s he served as Oakland city architect.Press Reference Library, 1912, p. 422. His projects were typical of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, including office buildings, hotels, theaters, clubs, commercial buildings, churches, and houses. He remained in practice in Oakland until at least 1940. Walter Mathews' younger brother Arthur Frank Mathews became a prominent San Francisco artist and furniture designer. The third son of Julius Mathews, Edgar, also became a well known Bay Area architect.Harvey L. Jones, The Art of Arthur and Lucia Mathews. San Francisco: Pomegranate (2006) p. 21.

The quantification of the capacity of a pozzolan to react with calcium hydroxide and water is given by measuring its pozzolanic activity. Pozzolana are naturally occurring pozzolans of volcanic origin.  History  Mixtures of calcined lime and finely ground, active aluminosilicate materials were pioneered and developed as inorganic binders in the Ancient world. Architectural remains of the Minoan civilization on Crete have shown evidence of the combined use of slaked lime and additions of finely ground potsherds for waterproof renderings in baths, cisterns and aqueducts. Evidence of the deliberate use of volcanic materials such as volcanic ashes or tuffs by the ancient Greeks dates back to at least 500‚Äì400 BC, as uncovered at the ancient city of Kameiros, Rhodes. In subsequent centuries the practice spread to the mainland and was eventually adopted and further developed by the Romans. The Romans used volcanic pumices and tuffs found in neighbouring territories, the most famous ones found in Pozzuoli (Naples), hence the name pozzolan, and in Segni (Latium). Preference was given to natural pozzolan sources such as German trass, but crushed ceramic waste was frequently used when natural deposits were not locally available. The exceptional lifetime and preservation conditions of some of the most famous Roman buildings such as the Pantheon or the Pont du Gard constructed using pozzolan-lime mortars and concrete testify both to the excellent workmanship achieved by Roman engineers and to the durable properties of the binders they used. Much of the practical skill and knowledge regarding the use of pozzolans was lost at the decline of the Roman empire. The rediscovery of Roman architectural practices, as described by Vitruvius in De architectura, also led to the reintroduction of lime-pozzolan binders. Particularly the strength, durability and hydraulic capability of hardening underwater made them popular construction materials during the 16th-18th century. The invention of other hydraulic lime cements and eventually Portland cement in the 18th and 19th century resulted in a gradual decline of the use of pozzolan-lime binders, which develop strength less rapidly. Over the course of the 20th century the use of pozzolans as additions (the technical term is \\"supplementary cementitious material\\", usually abbreviated \\"SCM\\") to Portland cement concrete mixtures has become common practice. Combinations of economic and technical aspects and, increasingly, environmental concerns have made so-called blended cements, i.e. cements that contain considerable amounts of supplementary cementitious materials (mostly around 20 wt.%, but over 80 wt.% in Portland blast-furnace slag cement), the most widely produced and used cement type by the beginning of the 21st century.  Pozzolanic materials  The general definition of a pozzolan embraces a large number of materials which vary widely in terms of origin, composition and properties. Both natural and artificial (man-made) materials show pozzolanic activity and are used as supplementary cementitious materials. Artificial pozzolans can be produced deliberately, for instance by thermal activation of kaolin-clays to obtain metakaolin, or can be obtained as waste or by-products from high-temperature process such as fly ashes from coal-fired electricity production. The most commonly used pozzolans today are industrial by-products such as fly ash, silica fume from silicon smelting, highly reactive metakaolin, and burned organic matter residues rich in silica such as rice husk ash. Their use has been firmly established and regulated in many countries. However, the supply of high-quality pozzolanic by-products is limited and many local sources are already fully exploited. Alternatives to the established pozzolanic by- products are to be found on the one hand in an expansion of the range of industrial by-products or societal waste considered and on the other hand in an increased usage of naturally occurring pozzolans. Natural pozzolanas are abundant in certain locations and are extensively used as an addition to Portland cement in countries such as Italy, Germany, Greece and China. Volcanic ashes and pumices largely composed of volcanic glass are commonly used, as are deposits in which the volcanic glass has been altered to zeolites by interaction with alkaline waters. Deposits of sedimentary origin are less common. Diatomaceous earths, formed by the accumulation of siliceous diatom microskeletons, are a prominent source material here.  Use  The benefits of pozzolan use in cement and concrete are threefold. First is the economic gain obtained by replacing a substantial part of the Portland cement by cheaper natural pozzolans or industrial by-products. Second is the lowering of the blended cement environmental cost associated with the greenhouse gases emitted during Portland cement production. A third advantage is the increased durability of the end product. Blending of pozzolans with Portland cement is of limited interference in the conventional production process and offers the opportunity to convert waste (for example, fly ash) into durable construction materials. A reduction of 40 percent of Portland cement in the concrete mix is usually feasible when replaced with a combination of pozzolanic materials. Pozzolans can be used to control setting, increase durability, reduce cost and reduce pollution without significantly reducing the final compressive strength or other performance characteristics. The properties of hardened blended cements are strongly related to the development of the binder microstructure, i.e., to the distribution, type, shape and dimensions of both reaction products and pores. The beneficial effects of pozzolan addition in terms of higher compressive strength, performance and greater durability are mostly attributed to the pozzolanic reaction in which calcium hydroxide is consumed to produce additional C-S-H and C-A-H reaction products. These pozzolanic reaction products fill in pores and result in a refining of the pore size distribution or pore structure. This results in a lowered permeability of the binder. The contribution of the pozzolanic reaction to cement strength is usually developed at later curing stages, depending on the pozzolanic activity. In the large majority of blended cements initial lower strengths can be observed compared to the parent Portland cement. However, especially in the case of pozzolans finer than the Portland cement, the decrease in early strength is usually less than what can be expected based on the dilution factor. This can be explained by the filler effect, in which small SCM grains fill in the space between the cement particles, resulting in a much denser binder. The acceleration of the Portland cement hydration reactions can also partially accommodate the loss of early strength. The increased chemical resistance to the ingress and harmful action of aggressive solutions constitutes one of the main advantages of pozzolan blended cements. The improved durability of the pozzolan-blended binders lengthen the service life of structures and reduces the costly and inconvenient need to replace damaged construction. One of the principal reasons for increased durability is the lowered calcium hydroxide content available to take part in deleterious expansive reactions induced by, for example, sulfate attack. Furthermore, the reduced binder permeability slows down the ingress of harmful ions such as chlorine or carbonate. The pozzolanic reaction can also reduce the risk of expansive alkali-silica reactions between the cement and aggregates by changing the binder pore solution. Lowering the solution alkalinity and increasing alumina concentrations strongly decreases or inhibits the dissolution of the aggregate aluminosilicates.

History The ECBC was established by the European Mortgage Federation (EMF) in 2004 to represent and promote the interests of covered bond market participants at the international level. The ECBC's main objective is to be the point of reference for matters regarding the covered bond industry and operate as a think-tank, as well as a lobbying and networking platform for covered bond market participants. The ECBC has over 100 members across over 30 active covered bond jurisdictions. ECBC members represent over 95% of covered bonds outstanding, which were worth nearly 2.5 trillion EUR at the end of 2015. Structure The ECBC Plenary meeting is a bi-annual discussion forum where all ECBC members gather around the table to discuss topical industry issues and to establish strong network links. The Steering Committee, headed by the ECBC Chairman, and composed of representatives from the major covered bond issuing jurisdictions and industry experts, is responsible for the day-to-day activities of the ECBC. The Steering Committee convenes once every quarter and addresses strategy related questions and coordinates the agendas of the various ECBC working groups (see below). The Secretariat of the ECBC is based in Brussels, Belgium. It coordinates the various ECBC bodies on a day-to-day basis. Working Groups * The EU Legislation Working Group has over the past five years been closely following the debate on the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) and has been successfully lobbying at EU level to obtain treatment that recognises the low risk profile of the instrument. In this respect, the group has drafted and passed comments to the European Institutions. * The Technical Issues Working Group represents the technical think thank of the covered bond community, drawing on experts from across the industry to tackle key issues for the industry. Recent work includes covered bond analysts and country experts working together to describe the key features of each covered bond jurisdiction, presented in an easy to use, comparable format on line. * The Market Related Issues Working Group discusses topics such as conventions on trading standards and the market-making process. The Working Group is currently leading the discussions on improving liquidity in secondary markets. * The Working Group on Statistics and Data is responsible for collecting and publishing complete and up-to-date information on issuing activities and volumes outstanding of covered bonds in all market segments. With 25 different covered bond jurisdictions and numerous issuers, the collection of data is of utmost importance, particularly given that the ECBC data is increasingly viewed as the key source of covered bond statistics. * The Fact Book Working Group is responsible for the publication of the annual European Covered Bond Fact Book. This publication covers key themes in the industry, market developments, provides a detailed overview of legislative frameworks in different countries as well as statistics. The latest edition of the ECBC Fact Book is available here. * The Rating Agency Approaches Working Group examines the rating approaches applied by rating agencies and has been active over the past year monitoring, analysing and reacting to the changes underway in covered bond rating methodologies. * The Global Issues Working Group focuses exclusively on covered bond issues from a global perspective. Membership of the ECBC continues to grow and its agenda for the coming year is already filled with numerous activities. The ECBC‚Äôs objective now is to press ahead in its work with a view to further strengthening its role in facilitating the communication among the different covered bonds stakeholders, working as a catalyst in defining the common features that characterise the asset class and in facilitating improvements in market practices, transparency and liquidity. Covered Bond Label Foundation The Covered Bond Label Foundation (CBLF) grants quality labels and is a response to a market-wide request for improved standards and increased transparency in the European covered bond market. The Label was established by the European Covered Bond Council (ECBC) in 2012 and developed by the European issuer community, working in close cooperation with investors and regulators, as well as in consultation with all major stakeholders. The Covered Bond Label is intended to result in multiple benefits with an enhancement of the overall recognition of and trust in the asset class. The Label facilitates access to relevant and comprehensive information for investors, regulators and other market participants, and demonstrates the determination of the covered bond community to tackle the challenges arising from the crisis. It also underlines the Industry‚Äôs active engagement in the maintenance of the high quality of the collateral assets, the improvement of transparency, and eventually, the promotion of liquidity and the strengthening of secondary market activity. The Covered Bond Label opened for registrations in mid-2012. Following on from an initial test phase run in 2012, the website became fully operational on 1 January 2013, with the first Labels being effective since then. As of January 2017, the Covered Bond Label website features 14 National Transparency Templates, 82 issuer Profiles and information on 98 labelled cover pools across 16 jurisdictions globally. Moreover, the website provides issuance data on close to 4,300 covered bonds, amounting to a total face value of over 1.4 trillion EUR, out of which over 2,000 covered bonds already include information on the Liquidity Coverage Requirement (LCR).

Players controlled giant vehicles called Mechanaughts (\\"mecha\\") and fought against the computer, or against other online players, in a variety of gameplay modes. The Mechanaughts were customizable. The game was free to download and play, but players could buy \\"NCcoins\\" with real money, through the NCcoin micropayment system. NCcoins could be used to purchase exclusive in-game weapons, skills, and parts. Exteel was released on December 4, 2007.Exteel It was terminated on September 1, 2010, when all Exteel international servers were permanently shutdown. The Chinese version of Exteel was known as G7 online and was published by PlayNC, a branch of NCSOFT.  Backstory  On June 27, 2008, the first part of Exteel's official back-story was posted to GameZone.com.http://www.gamezone.com/news/06_27_08_02_16PM.htm official Exteel back-story on GameZone.com It described a violent conflict in the distant future from a first-person point of view (with in-universe tone). Accordingly, a group of colonists had settled on the planet of Natha on the untamed continent of Taryn, the primary setting of the game. Over the course of thirty years, as the colony grew and advanced technologically, territories were slowly drawn up. Borders were reinforced by immigrants, trying to escape the Federation, from other planets such as Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Given these beginnings, weapons and fighting were almost unheard of on Natha in its early existence, and were not easily resurrected. To settle these disputes, mercenaries in battle-hardened Mechanaughts were hired by the four major nations on the planet: the subterranean-dwelling Marston, the financially prosperous Palamo, the newcomer and only recently independent West Palamo, and the technologically advanced Aiers. In time, small border conflicts grew between the government houses. Marston declared war on Palamo, after a village within Marston territory was destroyed. Palamo, claiming innocence, retaliated, and thus began the conflict around which the game is centered. The unnamed narrator wonders when the fighting will end and who will win the long war for independence fought on various planets. (No mention of extraterrestrial life is made, an indication that none will appear in the game.) Players assume the role of mercenaries fighting in endless battles across the developed continent, almost unrestrained by the governments who hired them.  Gameplay  Players start off with a free, cheap Mechanaught. Credits are used to purchase new parts, weapons, and skills, or secondary items such as repair points or paint and acquired through the various game modes. Some parts can only be purchased with real money via the NCcoin micropayment system. Most items in the game can be purchased using credits or NCcoins. Most items in the game can be bought for a time-limit or, for a higher price, a level of durability. If the time limit or the durability points of the item run out, then the item is lost and must be repurchased or the item must be repaired, respectively. Durability is based on the time that a player spends in game, whereas time-limit is based on the length of time after an item is purchased, regardless of whether or not a player actively plays the game. The rate at which durability of items is lost is dependent on the price of the item, with cheaper items losing durability at a slower rate than more expensive items. For all items, the time-limit is 7 or 30 days, depending on the item. Durability of items can be restored by using repair points, which can be purchased with credits. Repair points are the only items in the game that do not have durability or a time-limit, and the player keeps the repair points until they are used. Mechanaught performance is based on multiple factors that attribute to its stats. Heavy-class mechs often have more HP, EN, and SP‚Äîstats, improving its resilience in battle, but tend to be slower and easier to hit. Light-class mechs are the opposite, favoring speed and agility. Standard-class lingers in the middle. Parts from each class can be mixed and matched when building a Mechanaught. Weapons contribute less to your overall stats but carry stats of their own, regarding their performance. Some weapons are held with two hands, others can be mounted in each hand. Any weapon will produce a given amount of heat when fired, ultimately overheating the weapon until a cooldown period has elapsed. At this point, a player may switch to a secondary set of weapons, or wait for the weapons to cool down to be used again. Skills may be purchased to add another form of attack. With their own cooldown rate, skills may only be used when there is enough SP accrued in a given battle. Combat and its objectives are determined by the game mode the player chooses. Points are scored based on number of kills, contrasted to number of deaths, number of Aerogates currently in possession, number of flags captured, or ability to defend base towers. The team with the highest point total, or with their towers still standing, wins.  Modes of play  Most matches center around specified markers in the battlefield map called \\"aerogates\\". These are points of occupation that must be defended against for a positive outcome. An invading player merely steps onto an aerogate, to begin a capture process which will take several seconds. (Multiple allied players standing on an aerogate will increase the rate of capture.) Around most aerogates, there will also be a small number (usually 1-2) of healing pads, which will restore the health points (HP) of a player's mechanaught. However, healing pads have both a limited time of use for the allied side, and need time to restore themselves before they can be used again. Enemy players can only utilize allied healing pads when they capture the associated aerogate first.  Player-vs-player games   Death Match  This is a traditional Deathmatch, where each player must fight every other player. Healing pads are absent. Aerogates cannot be captured; however, they still act as spawn points.  Team Death Match  Team Death Match is referred to as \\"TDM\\". TDM is similar to Deathmatch, the key difference to deathmatch is that players are sorted into two teams, red and blue. Whilst healing pads are still absent in TDM, players with rectifier units are capable of restoring the HP of their teammates.  Territory Control  In game, Territory Control is shortened to \\"TC\\". TC requires greater strategy and skill than other game modes. As a result, players can get frustrated when novice players fail to stay in designated locations, leaving the aerogates unguarded, resulting in the loss of the aerogate to the other team. Gameplay in TC is reminiscent to Battlefield, where each team must capture aerogates in order to accumulate points. At the end of the round, the team with the most points wins. A team also wins if it captures the enemy's base.  Capture the Flag  Players are split into two teams. Similar to Territory Control, but with the added objective of making it to the enemy team's home aerogate and stealing their flag. The winning team is decided by which side captures the opponent's flag most often, within the 10 minutes of game play. If both teams capture the same amount of flags, then the match ends in a draw. If a player holding a flag is destroyed, the flag is restored when an opponent runs or touches the flag that is standing on the ground; the exception is, an allied player can grab the stranded flag before this happens. It currently has the best credit pay, after last stand level 3. :Unlike Territory Control, the number of aerogates occupied does not determine the winning team. In other words, if a team's flag is taken, that team loses, even if they occupy the majority of aerogates. * When a player captures an enemy flag, it appears on the back of their mechanaught for everyone to see, and will increase the EN drain of jumping and boosting, as well as cut their max EN in half. Speed is reduced by 10%. The goal is to eliminate opponents on the way, while protecting the flag. Capture the Flag is one of the most entertaining game modes to offer in the game Exteel.  Player-vs-computer games   Last Stand  Also called \\"LS\\", players are lumped into one team (which can go up to 8), and they fight together to destroy large numbers of computer-controlled drone mechanaughts. The drones appear in 2 large groups, at one location near the allied aerogates. The allies' objective is to defend the aerogates against these assaults. If one aerogate is captured by the drones, the game will end early in a defeat. The resistance of the drones can be increased only according to the difficulty level set by the master of the room before a game is started. The higher the difficulty level is set (ranging from 1 to 3), the higher score there is with each drone kill for the player(s). The number of drones that spawn per wave is dependent upon the number of players in the match before the wave starts. Competitions take place throughout every week. These \\"weeklies\\" award credits to players who manage to accumulate the highest number of points. The credits are awarded at every regular server maintenance on Wednesdays at 10 A.M. CDT. * An additional feature exists in Last Stand, which does not exist in all other game modes. Whereas in other modes, it is player-versus-player, and players have to depend on allied healing pads and allied Rectifiers to restore the HP level, in Last-Stand mode, it provides a unique full-restoration 'Healing Skill' option available to all players in the fifth Skill slot. Simply, when a player presses the \\"5\\" key on their keypad, their mechanaught will have its HP restored to full health, regardless of how much damage has been received. To prevent this feature from being consistently used to avoid damage altogether, the 'Healing Skill' takes one minute to renew itself, and is shown by remaining dark until it is ready to be used again. Unlike regular-combat Skills which must be purchased out-of-game in the Store menu, the 'Healing Skill' does not need to be purchased, and does not require SP to use. The only limit on its use is the cooldown activated after using it. For both Territory Control and Capture the Flag, stationary drone mechanaughts with powerful long-range siege cannons or rockets will appear to automatically defend allied aerogates. If an aerogate is captured, the drones will need to be destroyed for allied drones to appear. Unlike the drones in Last Stand, however, these have better armor, requiring more hits for a single drone. If destroyed, a drone will automatically re-spawn after 30 seconds. If an aerogate is neutral (i.e. has not been fully captured), no guarding drones will appear.  End of life announcement  On December 22, 2009, NCSoft terminated its license to Exteel SEA. In addition, IAM-Interactive had removed its forum and website contents, replacing them with an advisory to consume all coins within 30 days, despite Exteel game servers being offline at the time.http://iam-interactive.com/ The primary reasons for shutting down were a lack of financial stable income and NCSoft losing a lawsuit that resulted in a loss of 28 million dollars. The game and all of its international servers were permanently shutdown on September 1, 2010 at 10:00am CST.

For example, costumes, sets and musical accompaniment may be excluded, or may be included in a simpler form. One common purpose of a workshop production is to provide a preview staging of a new work in order to gauge audience and critical reaction, following which some parts of the work may be adjusted or rewritten before the work's official premiere. Because a workshop production generally pays less for the rights to perform the play, workshop productions also provide an opportunity for smaller theatres to generate increased publicity by staging a popular or highly anticipated work for which a full production might be too costly. Some theatre companies, in fact, specialize exclusively in workshop productions; amateur and youth theatre companies, for example, are commonly structured on the workshop production model. Some fictional works, including the musical A Chorus Line and the television series Smash, depict the audition and workshop processes of developmental theatrical productions.

Burroughs, which was released by Island Records in 1990. It was dedicated to Keith Haring. The CD is a collection of readings by Burroughs set to a broad range of musical compositions. It was produced by Hal Willner and Nelson Lyon, with musical accompaniment from John Cale, Donald Fagen, Lenny Pickett, Chris Stein, and alternative rock band Sonic Youth, among others. Although not Burroughs' first album--he released his first spoken word album Call Me Burroughs in the 1960s and was a fixture on the Giorno Poetry Systems collections of the 1970s and 1980s--this was the first release to receive wide public attention. Most of the recordings of Burroughs readings were made at his home in Lawrence, Kansas between December 12 and 15 1988, with further recordings taking place on June 24, 1989. The music was added at a later date. During these sessions Burroughs was captured singing the German standard \\"Ich bin von Kopf bis Fu√ü auf Liebe eingestellt\\" (Falling in Love Again), a song associated with Marlene Dietrich. This recording was included as a bonus track and is the only commercially available track as of 2012 to depict the author actually singing. The material performed by Burroughs on the album included excerpts from some of his famous works such as Naked Lunch, as well as a couple of items from his 1989 short story collection Tornado Alley. The track \\"Kill the Badger!\\" is an excerpt from Burroughs' novella The Cat Inside. A music video was created Burroughs' reading of \\"A Thanksgiving Prayer\\" (a poem from Tornado Alley); the reading (like the book from which it came) is dedicated to John Dillinger. Burroughs prefaces his reading of the short story \\"Where He Was Going\\" with a brief discussion of its inspiration and origins. The brief narrative \\"Brion Gysin's All-Purpose Bedtime Story\\" is taken from Ghost of Chance, a novella Burroughs would publish in 1991. Several tracks include Burroughs discussing elements of Christianity and The Bible in a conversational style, and one track has Burroughs reciting the Sermon on the Mount while adding editorial comment. The track \\"Ah Pook the Destroyer\\" was later used as the soundtrack for the acclaimed animated short film Ah Pook Is Here. Burroughs' song \\"Falling in Love Again\\" plays over the closing credits of the film.

Adults are dark with brown, grey, black and white patterning on the upperparts and breast. The tail is dark brown, with darker finely barred markings throughout. The male has large white outer tail tips on the 3 outermost tail feathers. The female has buffy tail tips. These are most distinguishing characteristic to distinguish its identity from its closest relative the Whip-poor-will from where the bird gets its name. It shows a prominent buff-colored collar around its neck and nape. Its song is also very different. It sounds like an accelerating cuk, cuk, cuk, cuk, cuk, cukacheea. Their breeding habitat is open country of Mexico and Central America to central Nicaragua. The northern limit of its range reaches just over the Mexican border to southeasternmost Arizona and southwesternmost New Mexico-(the Madrean Sky Islands in the eastern Sonoran Desert mountain region), where they are the only breeding resident birds. The nightjar's two eggs are laid directly on bare ground near rocks or scrubby vegetation--there is no nest. The adult may feign injury to distract an intruder from the eggs or young birds. They catch flying insects on the wing, making forays to catch their prey from the ground or a perch from a bush, tree, or large rock. They are mainly active at night, but can also be awake at dawn or dusk. They usually rest on the ground during the day. Name The buff-collared nightjar was previously known as Ridgway's whip- poor-will. Its scientific name (Antrostomus ridgwayi) was chosen in honor of Robert Ridgway, an American ornithologist of the 19th century.

Designed by Pritzker Prize winning architect Philip Johnson, it has an arena, theater, exhibit hall and meeting rooms. It opened in 1982 and completed an expansion to its lobby and meeting facilities in 2007. On the grounds of the Peoria Civic Center sits the massive \\"Sonar Tide,\\" the last and largest sculpture of the pioneer of abstract minimalism Ronald Bladen. History The site of the Civic Center includes the spot at Liberty Street and Jefferson Street where Moses and Lucy Pettengill lived from 1836 to 1862; that house was part of the Underground Railroad and Moses was also an Underground Railroad \\"conductor\\". In 1862, the Pettingills moved out of downtown and to Moss Avenue, where the present Pettengill‚ÄìMorron House was built in 1868. The downtown home was demolished in 1910 to make way for the Jefferson Hotel. The hotel, in turn, was imploded in 1978 to make way for the Civic Center. The first event at the Civic Center was a home and garden show in the Exhibit Hall in February 1982. Facilities Carver Arena , seating capacity was 9,919 for hockey and indoor football, 11,433 for basketball and up to 12,036 for concerts. Carver Arena has been hosts to acts such as Eagles, Elton John, Bob Seger, Kiss, Blake Shelton, Eric Church, Luke Bryan, Luke Combs, Jason Aldean, Cher, James Taylor, Avenged Sevenfold, Shinedown, Godsmack, Five Finger Death Punch, The Harlem Globetrotters, World Wrestling Entertainment, Disney, Monster Jam, Disney on Ice, and basketball exhibition games for the Chicago Bulls.

Despite having only traveled outside Vermont occasionally, in the New England college and club circuit, Phish embarked on a tour in the west. The band played seven shows in ten days to tiny crowds in small bars and restaurants in the ski towns of Telluride and Aspen. Colorado '88 collects, in chronological order, the best of those shows, providing a vivid glimpse into the days before the three and four-night stands at amphitheaters and arenas that would distinguish Phish in the years to come. Mastered from the original analog cassette tapes, Colorado '88 contains recordings of songs that had not previously been widely traded or heard with such clarity. Several of the tracks in the collection had never before appeared on an official Phish release. In 2018, new tapes of these shows were found, all of which were in full.http://phish.net/blog/1519410193/colorado-88-phish-new-to- circulation.html History When Phish arrived in the Colorado, they made the most of the opportunity, managing to improvise bookings for seven shows over the course of ten days - six of which were in the small mountain town of Telluride. According to Mike Gordon in The Phish Book: \\"My fiance Cilla Foster was responsible for our first tour. In 1988 she was waitressing in Telluride for a guy named Warren Stickney. I didn't know her very well at the time, but one day she called and said Stickney wanted us to come play in his bar. We'd never played further away from home than New Hampshire at the time, but Stickney promised to book a monthlong tour across the country. It took another six months to get him on the phone again, but I finally spoke with him about a week before we were supposed to hit the road. He said something like, 'I don't know if I can get you any other gigs, but you can play my place and I'll pay you a thousand bucks.' I couldn't get him on the phone after that, so the six of us - including Paul Languedoc and Tim Rogers, who was doing lights - decided to go for it anyway. \\"We finished playing a Nectar's gig at 2am, took a vote, and decided to head west then and there.

The New Jersey Digital Highway (NJDH) is a collaborative initiative led by cultural heritage institutions‚Äîincluding libraries, museums, archives, state agencies and other organizations‚Äîin New Jersey to provide online access to cultural and historical information about the state. The main participating institutions include Rutgers University Libraries, the New Jersey State Library, the New Jersey Department of Archives and Records Management, the Pietro and Maria Botto House, and the New Jersey Historical Society, with other institutions around the state providing additional collections. NJDH is designed to provide long-term preservation and access to cultural and historical artifacts in digital form. Its standard of digitization is a minimum of 600 dpi. The technology infrastructure is the FEDORA repository architecture, coupled with a data model and metadata implementation that provides access and management for digital resources and their analog source artifacts. NJDH provides guidance on digital encoding standards for images, text, and audiovisual files. NJDH also includes a manual on creating and sharing digital resources and offers a web-based workflow management system tool for submitting resources and metadata. The mission of NJDH is \\"shared access, local control.\\" It is designed to support collaboration and to provide participating organizations the opportunity to showcase their own collections, even as those collections are maintained and managed by the New Jersey Digital Highway repository architecture. The main person to contact for this project is Linda Langschied, Digital Projects Manager for Rutgers University Libraries. History In 2003, the New Jersey Digital Highway was created, funded in part from an approximately $500,000 National Leadership grant awarded by the Institute for Museum and Library Services. The term \\"highway\\" was used as a metaphor for linking separate \\"islands\\" of information. After 3.5 years, the NJDH was able to meet all the goals it had set out in its proposals, including the digitization of over 10,000 objects and participation from 17 cultural institutions. At the time of the final grant report written in the mid-2000s, the NJDH reported that its homepage acquired three thousand unique visitors a month, averaging eight to ten thousand visits per month. In September 2006, a research survey was conducted to determine usefulness, navigation, user lostness, terminology, and layout of the website. Overall, the response to the website was positive, out of 145 participants only 7% reported a negative experience. In response to the Virginia Tech shooting in 2007, Virginia Tech contacted the Rutgers University Libraries for assistance in creating a digital repository and memorial that used a similar implementation of FEDORA as the New Jersey Digital Highway. Northwestern University, Pennsylvania State University, and Princeton University also adapted Rutger's FEDORA platform and Workflow Management System for their own uses. Theme The immigrant experience in places such as Seabrook Farms, outlined in red, was the first theme of the NJDH. The inaugural collection for the NJDH focused on the theme \\"The Changing Face of New Jersey: The Immigrant Experience from Earliest Times to the Present\\", since New Jersey has historically been known as the \\"gateway state\\" for new immigrants arriving at Ellis Island and the \\"garden state\\" for its multicultural population. The immigrant experience in New Jersey is rich and varied, particularly as exemplified by the Seabrook Farms experience. Seabrook Farms, a family-owned frozen vegetable packing plant, recruited Japanese Americans from internment camps, beginning in January 1944. As World War II ended, they were joined by displaced persons from Eastern Europe, resulting in a rich multicultural community. The New Jersey Digital Highway documents this vanishing way of life in photographs, oral histories and written remembrances. Another prominent theme for the project, which intertwined with the immigrant experience, was the New Jersey labor movement, with many leaders who were first or second generation immigrants. The American Labor Museum, today known as the Botto House National Landmark, has a collection that includes papers and photographs from prominent Textile Workers' Union leader Sol Stetin as well as images and documents that convey the flavor and vigor of working class life at the turn of the 19th century. Collections The New Jersey Digital Highway offers four portals of information for specific audiences: the general public, educators, students, and the librarians, archivists and curators in New Jersey's cultural heritage institutions. Genealogy resources, working with digital primary sources, for educators and students, as well as lesson plans and educational activities are offered. The New Jersey Digital Highway collection features a selection of resources from a broad range of libraries, museums and archives, including: * Seabrook Farms Educational and Cultural Center * Botto House National Landmark * New Jersey State Library * Newark Museum With a grant from the New Jersey Historical Commission, the Monmouth County Historical Association added photographs from the Pach brothers to the online repository. The Clarence Dillon Public Library digitized their Anne O'Brien Historical collection. The Roseland Free Public Library has also digitized donated historical photographs of Roseland, New Jersey. The Digital Highway Collection gives guidance on creating standards-based digital collections in every format, addressing copyright issues, selecting collections to digitize and marketing to users. The general user portal has a broad range of information on New Jersey, from primary sources, to fun activities \\"off the beaten path\\" to explore New Jersey history and culture. One example page discusses the legend of the Jersey Devil. Jersey City Public Library With a grant by the New Jersey State Library, the Jersey City Free Public Library contributed a collection on the Dutch Immigrants in Jersey City. The initial contribution to NJDH included 3,700 pages of books and pamphlets, 22 photos, 4 maps, and 40 document and manuscript items ranging from 1 to nearly 300 pages. Atlantic County Library System The Atlantic County Library System utilized the service to create a browsable collection of artifacts from its Egg Harbor City German Project, which is organized and accessed at the library system's website but draws dynamically from the New Jersey Digital Highway repository through a search portal. This project resulted in the digitization of more than 30,000 immigration records and thousands of photos. Education modules The Paterson Silk Strike of 1913 (strike leaders pictured) is one of the NJDH's education modules. In February 2011, the former website Electronic New Jersey moved locations to the NJDH. The move provided 23 education modules with instructional activities and assessments about various New Jersey-related topics. The New Jersey Digital Highway has created several education modules that can be used by teachers and students in school. Initial module topics included the following: In 2005 and 2010 other modules were added to the original 23. More recent education modules have included: References Further reading  Langschied, Linda and Montanaro, Ann. ‚ÄúNew Jersey Digital Highway: Statewide Collaboration for Digital Preservation.‚Äù Microform & Imaging Review, 43 no. 4: 167-73, 2006.

The offbeat humour of the show attracted a small but cult audience, and the show only ran for two series. Background The character of Turtle had first appeared in 1975 in The Hanged Man, also created by Edmund Ward. Plot The series was an ITV ATV Drama, and dealt with a petty criminal named Turtle (played by John F. Landry) and his minder, \\"Razor\\" Eddie (Michael Attwell), who by accident come into possession of the proceeds of a major bank robbery. Eddie had been told to steal a van, and the van he stole turned out to be the getaway vehicle for the robbery. Inside were a large number of safe deposit boxes. Each episode of the show dealt with Turtle and Eddie opening one box and dealing with the contents of it. Part of the humour came from the interplay between Turtle and Superintendent Rafferty, who knew they did the crime, had no evidence on which to act, but lurked about in hope of a break.

A small number of experimental submachine guns (e.g., Tokarev 1927), designed by Fedor Tokarev, were also produced in a 7.62 mm Nagant chambering. None, however, were accepted into Soviet service. Background The projectile is seated below the mouth of the cartridge, with the cartridge crimp sitting just above the bullet. When fired in the Nagant revolver, the crimp expands into the forcing cone, completing the gas-seal and ostensibly increasing muzzle velocity by approximately 23 m/s (75 ft/s). The 7.62 mm caliber was chosen, in part, to simplify the tooling used in barrel making and manufacture of projectiles ‚Äî the Russian service rifle of the time, the Mosin‚ÄìNagant M1891 featured an identical bore diameter, being chambered for the 7.62√ó54mmR rifle cartridge. Commercially manufactured and loaded 7.62√ó38R cartridges are no longer difficult to find. Most commercially loaded ammunition for the Nagant, including Fiocchi and the \\"–°–°–°–†\\"-marked yellow box imports, are target ammunition, and do not have great stopping power. The low power of these rounds has given the Nagant a reputation as an underpowered sidearm. However, the original military ball cartridges fired bullets in the 6.5 g (100 grains) range at up to 330 m/s (1,100 ft/s), making them close to the .32-20 Winchester and .32 H&R; Magnum in power. One advantage of the round, if proper brass can be found, is that it leaves the chambers totally clean, and there is no need to scrape lead and powder residue out. Handloading 7.62√ó38R (7.62 Nagant) cartridge (left) next to a .32 S&W; Long Cartridge and a .22 LR cartridge for comparison. 7.62x38R military ammunition Many users of this caliber handload their own ammunition, though the proper brass cases are also expensive and difficult to come by. However, Starline has been developing and perfecting brass for the cartridge, and handloaders have had success using dies for the .32-20 and .30 Carbine to handload the rounds. 32-20 brass cases are inexpensive, readily available, and can be reformed and used safely in guns chambered for 7.62√ó38R, but the resulting cartridges are too short to achieve the gas seal. Cut down 223 brass reformed in 30 carbine dies can be utilized to load for the Nagant also. These will achieve the gas seal, but case rims will be undersized. Three other cartridges‚Äî.32 S&W;, .32 S&W; Long, and .32 H&R; Magnum‚Äîwill also generally chamber and fire in the revolver, but will not achieve the gas seal. The case head of the .32 S&W;/H&R; is about the same size as the case diameter of the Nagant cartridge, so the case head will sometimes actually end up moving into the chamber, thus preventing an adequate primer strike. Due to the dimensional differences between these cartridges and the original 7.62√ó38R cartridge, this practice is done at the shooter's own risk. The .32 H&R; Magnum in particular develops much higher pressures than the 7.62 Nagant or either of the .32 S&W; cartridges, which are both late 19th century developments. The most common anomaly when firing these cartridges is bulged cases.

It was established in 1944 by Vera Lachmann (1904‚Äì1985), a poet, classicist and educator who emigrated from Germany in 1939. In 1947 she was joined by the composer Tui St. George Tucker (1924‚Äì2004), who was the camp's music director. Camp Catawba closed after the 1970 season. The camp's nearest neighbors and indispensable practical aids were Mr. and Mrs. Ira W. and Sally Lentz Bolick, a mountain farm couple who descended from 18th-century German immigrants to America.The principal source for Camp Catawba is Charles A. Miller, A Catawba Assembly (New Market, Virginia: Trackaday, 1973) ; LC call number GV196.C35 M54. A review appears in The North Carolina Historical Review, vol. 51 (April 1974), p. 242. An additional source with more biographical information about the camp's director is Homer's Sun Still Shines Ancient Greece in Essays, Poems and Translations by Vera Lachmann, edited with an introduction and notes by Charles A. Miller (New Market, Virginia: Trackaday, 2005); . Reviews appear in Bryn Mawr Classical Review [online]. November 2004 and Classical World, vol. 99 (no. 4, summer 2006), pp. 466-67. Camp Catawba was small in size--the property was about , about half in fields (one of them a hillside) and half in forest. The forest was characterized by red oak and black locust, white pine and hemlock, as well as rosebay and Catawba rhododendron. The camp was also small in numbers--a maximum of 35 campers with an age range from 5 to 12. The boys attended for a full eight- week session. Cash poor but culturally rich, Camp Catawba was guided by Vera Lachmann's idealism, her upbringing in Weimar Germany, and her finding at Catawba a haven from the torment of the Nazi era.The poem \\"Catawba\\" (1972) is Lachmann's most succinct expression of the meaning of the site to her and her wish for the continuation of its values. The ode begins, \\"You dear piece of earth, wafted over by butterflies\\" It ends with a directive to all who knew the place: \\"O guard what is . . . and what was.\\" \\"Catawba\\" is published in the second of Lachmann's three bilingual volumes of poetry, with prose translations by Spencer Holst in collaboration with the poet. See Namen werden Inseln / Names Become Islands (Amsterdam: Castrum Peregrini Presse, 1975), pp. 74-75.Tui St. George Tucker, composer and music director of Camp Catawba. The boys at Catawba participated in traditional summer camp activities--ball games (on a sloping field), swimming (in a spring-fed pond and later in a modern pool), horseback riding (at stables in Blowing Rock), and hiking throughout the Cone Estate (now the Moses H. Cone Memorial Park) which bordered the camp, and across Grandfather Mountain.Vera Lachmann tells a story from Homer just before bedtime. Over the course of each summer, she retold either the Odyssey or the Iliad. It was cultural programs that distinguished the camp. Vera Lachmann, who taught classics at Brooklyn College, told the campers the Iliad and the Odyssey in alternating summers, and directed a drama program that included plays by Aeschylus, Sophocles and Aristophanes; Shakespeare, Moli√®re, Schiller and Yeats; and Nelly Sachs, who was a friend of hers. The music program, under Tui St. George Tucker, consisted of a choir, an orchestra (with some parts adjusted according to the instrumentalists available), and private lessons, particularly on the recorder, her professional specialty. Baroque (especially Bach) and early nineteenth century classical music (Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert) predominated. The boys also performed Gregorian chants and other medieval music, and Tucker's arrangements of Negro spirituals. Some arts counselors went on to become respected professionals including: Eva Frankfurther, Thomas Locker, Hannibal Alkhas, Mark di Suvero, and Richard Pepitone.Ira W. Bolick, farmer and Camp Catawba‚Äôs indispensable neighbor. Throughout Catawba's 27 summers, most of the campers and many of the staff came from New York City and Washington DC. In the beginning many of the boys were the sons of parents who, like Lachmann, had fled Nazi Germany. This also meant they were mostly Jewish - though Catawba was decidedly ecumenical and Lachmann read from both the Old and New Testaments at Sunday services. An article from 1951 in The Blowing Rocket, the local weekly newspaper, captures Lachmann's idealism, as well as the anomaly of Catawba in the southern mountains at the time: \\"There are in the camp today 29 boys from France, Germany, Norway, South American countries, New York and New Jersey, just as a sample of the various nationalities which the camp attracts. Absolutely no race or creed is turned away, and soon possibly color will be no bar to admission to the camp.\\"The Blowing Rocket, July 20, 1951. Catawba integrated in 1964. The camp‚Äôs central building, a chestnut lodge known as the Mainhouse. The physical heart of the camp was a chestnut lodge, constructed in 1913 before the blight decimated the American chestnut forests of the southern Appalachians. In 1985 the National Park Service purchased the camp grounds from Tui St. George Tucker, who inherited the site from Vera Lachmann, and on Tucker's death the Park Service took possession of the property. As of 2010, Park Service officials are deciding whether to preserve the chestnut lodge and how to interpret the camp to the public.Recent articles about Camp Catawba are Sally Treadwell, \\"The Gods Are Also Here,\\" High Country Magazine (Boone, NC), Oct/Nov 2007, pp. 82-93, and Jen Aronoff, \\"Blue Ridge Camp Gave Jewish Boys Classic Ideals,\\" Charlotte Observer, Dec. 27, 2007, p.

It lives in burrows in coastal and estuarine mud-flats, and can be extremely abundant. It can be differentiated from its congeners U. pugnax and U. minax by the smoothness of the inside of its claws. One claw is larger than the other, and can be much larger than the crab's body, at up to long. Description The carapace is square in shape, tapering slightly to the rear; it can reach a width of , but is typically up to wide and long. The space between the eyes is much shorter than the eyestalk. The males have one extremely enlarged chela (claw), which they use to claim their territory and fight with other males. The claw can be much larger than the body, at up to long, or exceptionally up to long. It is common for males to lose claws in the battles. When this happens, the claw regenerates and the opposite side begins to enlarge. Fiddler crabs are right or left clawed. The inside of these claws are also very smooth, unlike its other close relatives Uca pugnax and Uca minax. Geographic distribution Uca pugilator is one of only five species of fiddler crabs found primarily in temperate areas. The species occurs on the east coast of North America and in the Gulf of Mexico, having been found as far north as Massachusetts and as far south as Texas and Florida. This species has also reportedly been found in the Bahamas. They may also be found in the warmer waters of the Atlantic along the West coast of Africa. Habitat Uca pugilator can be found in estuarine and coastal areas or sheltered shores with sandy or muddy substrates.

Kassope occupies a magnificent and remote site on a high platform overlooking the sea, the Ambracian Gulf and the fertile lands to the south, and with the slopes of the Zalongo mountain to the north. It is considered one of the best remaining examples of a city built on a rectilinear street grid of a Hippodamian plan in Greece.Guide Bleu, Greece. Hachette Livre, 2000. p. 627. History The first settlements on the site are from the Paleolithic. However the city of Kassope was founded in the middle of the 4th century BC as the capital of the Kassopaeans, a sub-tribe of the Thesprotians. It belonged to the Aetolian League. Cassope or Cassopia is mentioned in the war carried on by Cassander against Alcetas II of Epirus, in 312 BC. The city flourished in the 3rd century BC, when large public buildings were built. Kassope also minted its own coins. It was destroyed by Roman forces in 168-167 BCCassope page of the Hellenic Ministry of Culture Kassope was abandoned in 31 B.C. when the remaining inhabitants resettled to Nikopolis the region's new capital. Archaeology The ruins of Kassope were visited and described by William Martin Leake in the early 19th century.Travels in Northern Greece: Volume 1 by William Martin Leake, 2001, page 252, \\"... marching from Acarnania into Epirus, pitched his camp near the city Cassopia 3. ...\\" Extensive excavations were performed by a Greek team under Sotiris Dakaris in 1952 and 1955, and in 1977-1983 by a team from the University of Ioannina together with the German Archaeological Institute, co-led by Dakaris, Wolfram Hoepfner, Konstantina Gravani, and Ernst-Ludwig Schwandner. The visible remains include the Cyclopean walls, an agora, a theatre, the prytaneion. Sights and Monuments of Kassope Kassope has remarkable monuments which dominate the plateau. Walls of Kassope Kassope was protected on the south and east by strong Cyclopean polygonal walls, which are preserved in several places. The total length of the walls is estimated at 6 km and the maximum height was 10 m, and width 3-5 m. The city had two main entrances; east and west. The east gate of Kassope is entered today by tourists and protected by a large metal gate, which rescued the slot on the rock [6] . Kassope had some minor gates. A small western gate survives today in good condition, and looks like a stone tunnel because it is covered with a megalithic arch. The Macedonian Tomb is visible on the right. The North Stoa Constructed in the period of the Public of Epirus (234 / 3-168 BC) the Stoa has a polygonal stone shelf and superstructure was brick with wooden frames. The north side is reinforced with 17 buttresses. Inside there was a colonnade with 13 Ionic columns. In front of the North Portico revealed 21 stone pedestals with inscriptions of 3rd-2nd century BC The position of the market and the public space of Kassope had direct contact with the main road and the gate of the wall, position favouring an easy access of rural residents in the area of the Commonwealth of Epirus operation. It was men gathering place, covered 100x80m area = 8.000 m2 and could accommodate hundreds of people.[6] The West Lodge Located on the west side of the market, between the temple and the Prytaneion. It consists of a peristyle court with 3 x 4 Doric columns . Around the courtyard, arranged six spaces. To the east there was gallery with 13 Doric columns. Temple - Sanctuary is in contact with the West Gallery, in the east. In the courtyard of this is the altar of Venus.

The Katagogeion The Katagogeion was a public building dimensions 33 x 30,3 m., With patio, two floors on three sides and the fourth storey to hiding the sun and probably functioned as a hostel, ancient hotel. Another view says that probably they were a kind of shopping mall. A similar building was in ancient Olympia . It dates to around 400-350 BC It consists of a rectangular central courtyard (Aithrion, atrium) 14x12 m dimensions, surrounded by four galleries with 7 x 8 Octagonal columns with Doric capitals . Behind the arcades are lined spaces which communicate with each other, but only with the galleries. There was a second floor with balcony and communication was by a wooden staircase, whose stone pedestals were rescued. Under the Hellenistic dive was oldest building of the 4th century BC The 31 bedrooms of Katagogeiou was 18 on the ground floor and 13 on the upper deck. The bricks of the tile roof are preserved and must be constructed in neighboring Amvrakia which had workshops ceramics . [6] . The Little Theatre, or Odeon or Bouleuterion The Odeon is located in the southeastern part of the city and is the first monument we just enter in the city, left. It dates to the 3rd century BC It seems to be carved on a rock, with construction of stone stands on this. Its capacity is about 300-500 people and suggested that seats 2,500 [12] is excessive. The Conservatory was housed, the roof rested on square surrounding wall and the dimensions of the stage was 15.4 x 7,60 m. Using Conservatory apparently was music and literary events, but may be used as the Chamber of Public of Epirus. Front Conservatory ruins an altar, possibly of Apollo. Department of rock underlying the Conservatory has collapsed and there were placed guardrail [6] . The Grand Theatre Located in the ruined hill northwest of Kassope. Constructed in the 3rd century BC and had a capacity of about 2,500 people, according to some authors could accommodate 6,000 people. It was the largest of a total of two theaters that existed in the city. The other, called the Conservatory of distinction. The large theater due to natural decay is now destroyed and almost not open, but clearly at a distance 200 m. Landslides rocks have led to some of them in the theater.

The ceiling is vaulted from carved stone and has a hole from looters [6] . The tomb was found empty because it was looted in the past. It is certain that it belonged to someone important noble Kassope, possibly Macedonian ally [13] . Another view says that this is probably Memorial founder of the city [14] . The sanctuary of Aphrodite Its ruins are located outside the city Kassope next to the road leading to Zalogo, 200m east of that. Temple was peripteral hexastyle dimensions 17,20 x 10,15 m.

It was established by Marguerite Bourgeoys, who created a religious community for women that was not cloistered; the sisters were allowed to live and work outside the convent.Simpson (2005), p. 5. The Congregation held an important role in the development of New France, as it supported women and girls in the colony and offered roles for them outside the home. It founded a boarding school for girls' education, watched over the filles du roi, women immigrants whose passage was paid by the Crown, which wished to encourage marriages and the development of families in the colony. Some filles de roi and sisters served as missionaries to the First Nations peoples.Dumont, Micheline (2004). \\"Congr√©gation de Notre-Dame,\\" in The Oxford Companion to Canadian History, ed. Gerald Hallowell. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Oxford Reference Online. The community's motherhouse has been based in Montreal for more than 350 years. Marguerite Bourgeoys was canonized in 1982 by the Roman Catholic Church and is Canada's first woman saint. Origins of the Congregation De Notre Dame The Congr√©gation Notre- Dame was a women's religious order created in France by Pierre Fourier and Alix Le Clerc, committed to education. Following a spiritual experience in 1640 and a long search for a place within the more conventional contemplative women's religious communities, Bourgeoys joined the externe Congregation at Troyes. As Bourgeoys helped in the Congregation of Notre Dame, she had a vision of a new kind of religious community for women, who would be active and among those who needed their help, and not cloistered in a convent. She modeled it after that of the Canonesses of Mattaincourt. In 1653, Paul de Chomedey de Maisonneuve, founder of Ville Marie (Montreal), visited Troyes, and invited Bourgeoys to go to Ville Marie to teach; she set out in June of that year, and upon arrival devoted her time to a variety of works of mercy. She opened her first school in April 1657, but soon returned to France to recruit assistants; four companions joined her. The Congregation of Notre Dame of Montreal convent from rue Saint-Jean-Baptiste, ca. 1684-1768, Montreal, Quebec Location By 1665, the Congregation consisted of Bourgeoys and three other sisters living in Montreal; they taught in a stone building known as the \\"stable school\\" established in 1658.Gray (2007), p. 4. The Convent was near the corner of Notre-Dame and Saint Paul Street, in what is now called Old Montreal. As revealed by its architectural plans, the early convent was a private space, secluded from the public life of Montreal. The convent was placed deeply within its own terrain, and its separation from public life was protected by the H√¥tel Dieu and the walls that surrounded it.Gray (2007), p. 18. The sisters were provided protection and seclusion whilst surrounded by the colony's merchants and more rowdy inhabitants, such as soldiers and labourers. Maison Saint-Gabriel The Maison Saint-Gabriel today In October 1662, Maisonneuve conceded land in Pointe-Saint-Charles to Bourgeoys in order to establish a farm that would feed the Congregation and support its work. In 1668, Bourgeoys purchased the adjoining Maison Saint-Gabriel farm which the sisters of the Congr√©gation de Notre-Dame operated for nearly 300 years. It was temporary home for some of the King's Wards, also called the King's Daughters, or Filles du Roi. On the property, the sisters produced food and products to support the Congr√©gation de Notre-Dame, new settlers and others in need. Today the property has been developed as a living museum of farming and historic times. The property, outbuildings and grounds have been restored and expanded, and the museum houses some 15,000 artifacts recreating the feel of the house from the 17th and 18th century.\\"History\\" , Maison Saint- Gabriel website, accessed 6 Feb 2010 The Congregation received civil recognition in 1671 from King Louis XIV\\"Who is Marguerite Bourgeoys?\\", Congr√©gation de Notre Dame and was granted official status by the Catholic Church in 1698: some 40 years after its creation and only two years before the death of Marguerite Bourgeoys. In 1675 Bourgeoys built a chapel dedicated to Notre Dame de Bon Secours. To insure greater freedom of action Mother Bourgeoys founded an uncloistered community, its members bound only by simple vows. They aided the pastors in the various parishes where convents of the order had been established, by instructing children. Although the community had received the approbation of the Fran√ßois de Laval, Bishop of Quebec, the foundress became very desirous of having the conditions of non-enclosure and simple vows embodied in a rule. To confer with the bishop, who was then in France, she undertook a third journey to Europe. She returned the next year, and resisted the many attempts made in the next few years to merge the new order in that of the Ursulines, or otherwise to change its original character. Houses were opened at Pointe-aux-Trembles, near Montreal, at Lachine, at Champlain and Ch√¢teau Richer. In 1685 a mission was established at Sainte Famille on the Island of Orl√©ans. Controversy of the uncloistered The difficulties of establishing a non-cloistered religious order for women in 17th century New France were considerable. At the time, the church preferred the regimen of the cloistered nun behind the walls of a convent. Before 1698, the first two bishops of Quebec, Fran√ßois de Laval and Jean-Baptiste de La Croix de Chevri√®res de Saint-Vallier, were ambivalent about the Congregation, failing to understand their need to remain uncloistered. However, they did recognize the societal need for traveling teachers; they counted on Bourgeoys and her sisters to reach the small and dispersed population of Canada in these early years. They were needed to take education to the children between Quebec and Montreal and beyond. If women were to be the educators, Laval and Saint- Vallier reluctantly recognized the sisters needed to be able to travel and live outside a convent. The sisters were allowed to live a relatively uncloistered life. By 1694 Bishop Saint-Vallier sent the Congregation a new constitution that imposed more restrictions. The sisters had enjoyed certain freedoms for approximately forty years, and resisted more restrictive and conventional rules.Gray (2007), p. 19. The constitution afforded the Congregation the right to officially declare vows, necessary to gain legitimacy in the frontier society and grow as an organization. It required the sisters to be obedient to and report directly to the bishop of Quebec. The document also required them to take solemn vows, attacked their more secular activities in the convent, and instituted the requirement of a dowry to be donated by new sisters. After a few years of resistance, in 1698 the sisters had to accept Saint-Vallier's constitution; it had traditional requirements long enforced in Europe. After Saint-Vallier's constitution The nuns were to take vows, including a traditional one of stability. This meant that women could not leave the convent at will. The constitution created a hierarchical divide, also traditional, between the women who had taken their vows and those who had not. The bishop imposed payment of a dowry by new recruits. In practice, it prevented attracting women of the lower classes, whose families generally did not have money to contribute. While the new constitution enforced more traditional conditions, the sisters of the CND maintained some seventeenth-century practices. Many of them continued to teach, travel and lend their expertise to other parishes across New France.  Role of Congregation Sisters in the Education of Women and Ile Royale  Schools were essentially administered by the Church, eighteenth-century formal education focused on behavioural aspects, it was about having a civilized Christian population, Cultivation of the human heart was the first step in the education process. Christian moral principles were taught to the children who attended religious schools in New France. Nearly all the teachers in New France belonged to the clergy, as evidenced by the 1727 ordinance issued in Canada. This document stated that all teachers in the colony needed approval from the Bishop of Quebec. Teacher's methods and material were closely monitored by their parish's priest. The formal education system on the colony of Ile Royale was however non-existent. Founded in 1713, Ile Royale was located in areas of the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. While preparing the colony's establishment in 1713, the minister of the marine never once discussed the establishment of schools. He believed that the R√©collets missionaries would open colonial parish schools. By the mid 1720s, there were still no established schools in a small but significant community of over 300 children. Conflicting opinions between local and royal officials led locals to take the matter of education into their own hands. Imperial officials refused the commisonnaire-ordonnateur M√©zy's demand to establish a public catholic school in Louisbourg. Concerned about the ethic and moral teaching of girls, M√©zy and other local officials turned to Montreal's Congr√©gation Notre Dame. The commissaire-ordonnateur suggested that a delegation of religious sisters from the Congr√©gation should be sent to help educate girls. Finally in 1727 Marguerite Roy and two sisters were sent from Montreal to oversee the teaching of girls in the colony. Very shortly after arriving they established a school and took 22 girls under their wing. The bishops of Quebec saw this as an urgent cause, particularly Bishop Saint-Vallier showed great concern about the moral instruction and upbringing of girls raised in the colony. However, financial difficulties complicated their task, as they needed to purchase a house in which they would teach. The sisters sold straw pallets to soldiers in order to supplement their income. On the other hand, the religious brothers were much wealthier, and their teaching benefited from more resources and superior infrastructure. Ile Royale was a poor religious community, low income, debt and budget issues were a consistent problem for the sisters of the Congr√©gation Notre-Dame well into 1753. Despite the restricted the number of girls admitted by the sisters, many girls from the colony of Ile Royale were instructed successfully by sisters from the Congr√©gation Notre-Dame. Consistent with the era, instruction in morality and Christian ethics remained more important than education in reading and writing. Both female day students and boarders benefited from the school. Along with religious obligations mandatory in all parish run schools in New France, religious texts permitted girls to learn how to read and write. Some math was also taught, although limited. The education given to girls under the sisters of Congr√©gation Notre- Dame in Ile Royale was considered adequate by the standards of the era. Students of the school had to follow a consistent weekly schedule. During the latter half of the nineteenth century, missions were established in various parishes of the Provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and in the United States; also many academies and schools were opened in the city of Montreal.Euphrosine, Sister St. \\"Congregation of Notre Dame de Montreal.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 11.

Founded in 1864, the publication now covers northwestern Iowa and portions of Nebraska and South Dakota. The Journal has won numerous state, regional and national awards. It was named one of the \\"10 that do it right\\" by the publishing trade journal Editor and Publisher in 2009 and 2013. The Journal is owned by Lee Enterprises Inc. History The Sioux City Journal was founded as a weekly newspaper on August 20, 1864 by Samuel Tait Davis (1828‚Äì1900) and others who wanted a strong local voice for the Union Party and the re-election of Abraham Lincoln. Serving as the first editor, Davis continued until after the election, ensuring a pro-Lincoln perspective. With the end of the Union Party after the Civil War, this shifted to a pro-Republican stance. George and Henry Perkins bought the Sioux City Weekly Journal in 1869, and within a year converted it to a daily newspaper. Continuing the Republican editorial line, George Perkins (1840‚Äì1914) served as editor in between terms as a Republican officeholder. Among other offices, he served in the Iowa Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives, and \\"lost a highly contested bid for Iowa's governorship in 1906.\\" Noted political cartoonist Jay Norwood Darling, better known as \\"Ding,\\" worked for the Journal between 1900 and 1906. He later won two Pulitzer Prizes for the Des Moines Register and Leader. After George Perkins died early in 1914, the paper was left to his son, William R. Perkins, and son-in-law, William Sammons. They hired noted architect William L. Steele to design a new four-story building at the southwest corner of Douglas Street and 5th Street. Housing the paper's editorial, reporting, circulation, advertising sales, and printing operations, the building was ready for occupancy in 1915. Sammons ran the Journal until his death in 1944. One of his accomplishments was purchasing in 1941 the Journal's primary competitor, the erstwhile pro-Democratic Sioux City Tribune. Since the Journal was a morning paper and the Tribune an evening paper, for over 30 years they continued both papers with a merged staff. Upon Sammons' death in 1944, William R. Perkins took over publication of the Journal until 1962, and Elizabeth Sammons (daughter of Clara Perkins Sammons) assumed that role in 1962. By 1972, the elegant building designed by William L. Steele was no longer meeting the paper's needs, and a new plant was built east of downtown at Sixth and Pavonia Streets. The Journal moved there in November of that year, and the Steele building was demolished soon afterwards. On December 14, 1972, the Journal- Tribune Publishing Co. was purchased by Hagadone Corp. of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, and Howard Publications of Oceanside, California. Shortly after the ownership change, the Journal dropped its afternoon editions and became a seven-day morning paper. Lee Enterprises Inc. of Davenport, Iowa, bought Howard Publications in February 2002, giving it half-ownership of the paper; in June 2002, Lee purchased the remaining half from Hagadone. The newspaper founded radio station KSCJ in 1927 and co-founded television station KTIV in 1953. Both have been sold off. See also *George D.

(RHCI) was a kit helicopter manufacturer based in Excelsior Springs, Missouri. The company designed, manufactured and marketed the Mini-500 single-seat helicopter, so-called because the fuselage superficially resembled the MD-500 five-place turbine powered helicopter. History The company was founded by Dennis L. Fetters, a former associate of Augusto Cicar√©, the self-taught Argentine inventor of a novel helicopter control linkage system. The design basis of the Mini-500 was Cicar√©'s CH-4, circa 1982. Before launching RHCI, Fetters had operated Air Command International, a manufacturer of autogyros. The Mini-500 design initially intended to use Cicar√©'s control system design, but Fetters and Cicar√© were unable to agree on licensing terms. Fetters instead elected to design and patent a \\"newly improved control system\\", as he termed it.Armstrong, Kenneth: Choosing Your Homebuilt ‚Äî the one you will finish and fly! Second Edition, page 202-205. Butterfield Press, 1993. RHCI sold the last Mini-500 in October 1999 and the company went out of business in November after the product developed a poor safety record with more than 40 accidents and nine fatalities. Critics said that the aircraft was \\"woefully underpowered and subject to excessive engine and rotor vibrations that lead to cracked frames and other component failures.\\" At the time of its demise the company had a two-place kit helicopter under development, the Voyager-500. Former employees reported that the prototype flew less than three hours and only ever hovered. None were ever delivered to customers. Aftermath Fetters claimed that the company's problems were caused by vocal critics who caused orders to fall off. In particular Fetters blamed Jim Campbell, publisher of US Aviator magazine, Bill Phillips, president of the International Experimental Helicopter Association, former RHCI dealer Fred Stewart, and former employees Lee Sarouhan and Rick Stitt. In assessing the company failure Bill Phillips, president of the International Experimental Helicopter Association said: \\"In my opinion, Dennis Fetters is one of the biggest cons that‚Äôs ever hit the kit industry\\". Jim Campbell, publisher of US Aviator magazine said: \\"I find this really sad. Nobody wanted to see him succeed more than we did, but the problem here is that there have been hundreds of failures, dozens of accidents and nine fatalities among 100 flying helicopters\\". RHCI President Dennis L. Fetters said of the closure: \\"We at RHCI do not blame ourselves for the need to close our business. On the contrary, we credit ourselves for not only surviving these ruthless attacks, but for beating the odds of even starting a helicopter manufacturing factory. We took it farther than anyone could have expected under the circumstances\\". Shortly after the company closed, Fetters sold his house in Excelsior Springs, changed his name to Mohammed Al Faris and was unable to be located by the media for further interviews. In the early 2010s, Fetters moved to China and started a new company, Fetters Aerospace, to develop unmanned aerial vehicles for Chinese customers. Fetters made a public appearance in 2013 in Washington, D.C. as Ewatt CTO at the 2013 Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International conference.

Biography Early years and education Charles Kellaway was born at the parsonage attached to St James's Old Cathedral, Melbourne. His father was an evangelical Anglican minister, and many of Kellaway's siblings were instilled with religious zeal. Kellaway himself was determined to become a medical missionary in Egypt, but lost his faith during the tragedies of World War I. He was educated at home until aged 11, attended Caulfield Grammar School in 1900 and, after receiving a scholarship, went on to complete his secondary education at Melbourne Church of England Grammar School, 1901‚Äì06. Following school he went to the University of Melbourne in 1907 to study medicine, although he had to turn down the residential Clarke scholarship at Trinity College owing to the family's limited finances. Working through a difficult period in the medical school's curriculum, Kellaway nevertheless completed his MB and BS in 1911, his MD in 1913, and his MS in 1915. On graduating, he was lauded as the most brilliant student ever to have completed a medical degree at the university. World War I service and research training in Britain Upon concluding his formal studies in 1914, Kellaway held the acting professorship in anatomy at the University of Adelaide during 1915. He enlisted that November, serving as a captain in Egypt in 1916 with the Australian Army Medical Corps. Kellaway was fortunate that his first posting saw him working with Charles Martin, the director of London's Lister Institute, who encouraged Kellaway's scientific ambitions. After working as a regimental medical officer in Flanders during 1917, Kellaway was awarded a Military Cross for fortitude under fire, and in 1918 was promoted to major. During 1918‚Äì19 he was attached to the Australian Flying Corps medical boards in London, concurrently initiating research into problems related to anoxia under Henry Dale. Dale was doubtless Kellaway's lifelong scientific mentor and patron, and he is likely to have encouraged Kellaway to apply for the Royal Society's inaugural Foulerton Studentship in 1919. This Kellaway did after his repatriation to Australia, spending the second half of 1919 as acting professor of physiology at Adelaide University. Winning the Foulerton Studentship allowed Kellaway to return to Britain, spending the years 1920‚Äì23 working with Dale at the National Institute for Medical Research, with Charles Sherrington at Oxford University, and with Thomas Elliott at the University College Hospital in London. These years were critical both in forming Kellaway's scientific direction and his conceptions as to how medical research ought to be configured in Australia. Kellaway moved back to Melbourne in August 1923 when invited to become the second director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Research in Pathology and Medicine (now the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research). Directorship of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute During his first years at the Hall Institute, Kellaway concentrated on organisational and financial aspects. These included securing an increased stipend from the Walter and Eliza Hall Trust, additional income from Melbourne University, and ‚Äì most importantly ‚Äì permission to seek benefactions beyond these bodies. Kellaway's networking amongst doctors, medical industrialists and the wider business community led to several significant gifts which allowed, amongst other things, the establishment of a library and a new biochemistry department. This accorded with his reorganisation of the scientific activities of the institute from a series of sundry pathology services into three discrete research streams: biochemistry (under Cambridge-trained Henry Holden), bacteriology (under the recent Australian graduate, Frank Macfarlane Burnet) and physiology (Kellaway). His own work ranged across various fields during the mid-twenties, including kidney disease and hydatid infection (echinococcosis). An important contribution to public perceptions of medical research occurred in early 1928, when Kellaway was invited by the Minister of Health to form a Royal Commission of inquiry into the 'Bundaberg tragedy', in which 12 children died following inoculation with diphtheria toxin-antitoxin. The rigour of this inquiry was lauded by the medical profession and public alike, both vindicating the Commonwealth's diphtheria immunisation programme and drawing international attention to Kellaway's thoroughgoing scientific investigation. Scientific research into Australian snake venoms Although his early studies garnered a degree of acclaim, it was in late 1927 that Kellaway found his experimental forte. At the suggestion of Neil Hamilton Fairley ‚Äì then resident at the Hall Institute whilst recuperating from tropical sprue ‚Äì a significant research programme was instigated into Australian snake venoms. This practical and scientific problem had not been substantively addressed since the turn of the century researches by Frank Tidswell and Charles Martin. Kellaway also used the opportunity to negotiate with the Minister for Health one of the first ad- hoc grants for medical research in Australia, preceded only by a limited number of cancer investigations. This grant lasted from 1928‚Äì31 and was a milestone in Commonwealth support for independent research in medical science. Working with Fairley, Holden and Fannie Eleanor Williams from the Institute, plus Frederick Morgan from the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (now CSL Limited) and Tom 'Pambo' Eades from the Melbourne Zoo, Kellway's research encompassed venoms from a plethora of Australian snake species (elapidae). This work initially focused on characteristing biting apparatus, venom yields, pharmacological activity, lethality and immunology. Clinical work included investigations into the appropriate first-aid treatment of snakebite and the development of antivenenes (antivenoms) against tiger snake (Notechis scutatus), copperhead (Austrelaps superbus) and death adder (Acanthophis antarcticus) venoms, although only the first was found suitable for manufacture by CSL. In addition to expanding field work on identification and characterisation of a wide range of Australian elapids and their venoms, Kellaway's work through the 1930s broadened to include platypus, mussel, Sydney funnel-web spider (Atrax robustus) and redback spider (Latrodectus hasselti) venoms. This huge corpus of work, totalling over 70 publications by the end of the programme, resulted in an invitation for Kellaway to review his oeuvre via the prestigious Charles E Dohme Memorial Lectureships at Johns Hopkins University Medical School (now Johns Hopkins School of Medicine) in 1936 ‚Äì an impressive international accolade. The Dohme lectures also coincided with a shift in Kellaway's interest towards tissue injury by venoms, particularly their effects on haemodynamics. His investigations thus returned to the study of histamine and anaphylaxis that had characterised his early 1920s work with Dale, while Kellaway was furthermore encouraged by the two- year tenure of expatriate German pharmacologist, Wilhelm Feldberg, at the Hall Institute (1936‚Äì38). During this period, working also with his compatriots Hugh LeMessurier and Everton Trethewie, Kellaway's programme evolved into a study of the release of endogenous mediators in response to tissue injury. The investigations encompassed not only histamine, but also lysocithin (now lysolethicin) and identified a new agent, the slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A), plus a related SRS that was released in response to direct tissue insult. This work later instigated the substantial field of leukotriene pharmacology, but for Kellaway the programme was curtailed by the outbreak of World War II. His final experimental work during the early 1940s progressed on to the response of tissues to other insults including bacterial toxins, radiant heat and anaesthetic agents. Nevertheless, it is fair to say that the venom programme earned Kellaway an international scientific reputation ‚Äì during a period when few researchers of such stature were working in Australia ‚Äì and contributed to his election to Fellowship of the Royal Society in 1940. Fostering an Australian medical research culture Kellaway in 1936 A less prominent, but equally important, aspect of Kellaway's contribution to Australian medical science was his development of models and an infrastructure conducive to the growth and sustenance of a local research culture. Throughout the 1920s and 30s, when there were only a handful of medical research institutes in the country and very little original investigation was undertaken at the universities, the Hall Institute represented a visible, viable exemplar for those wishing to pursue a research career. Although many aspiring Australian scientists continued to travel to England or the USA for their training and to garner experience, an increasing number either remained in Australia or returned home as the 1930s progressed. During this period spanning the Great Depression, Kellaway was both committed and adroit in projecting the value of medical research outwards ‚Äì to the medical profession, to the public and to politicians. In 1934 he instigated an agreement with the Commonwealth Government and the Rockefeller Foundation to jointly finance the Hall Institute's new virus research department under Burnet. This was another important precedent that helped inform the legislation that created the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH&MRC;) in 1937. Indeed, Kellaway campaigned for the formation of such a body, extolling its necessity both in his orations and via practical examples. At a more prosaic level, Kellaway was widely recognised for his encouragement of staff members and aspiring researchers, while his experience and the conspicuous success of the Hall Institute meant that he was consulted by other emerging facilities. In particular, the Kanematsu Memorial Institute of Pathology in Sydney sought his advice on the appointment of a new director, and Kellaway championed the selection of the Australian neurophysiologist, Jack Eccles. An inaugural member of the Association of Physicians of Australasia (1930) and a foundation Fellow of its successor body, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians (1938), Kellaway rose to become Vice- President of the latter from 1942‚Äì44: a high honour for a non-clinician. World War II service and international coordination of research It is fair to say that by the start of World War II, Charles Kellaway was the most prominent medical research figure in Australia, and ‚Äì alongside Burnet and Eccles ‚Äì amongst the most well regarded by the international scientific community. Even before the outbreak of hostilities, however, he moved away from the laboratory and into administrative and consultative roles. In the late 1930s he had supported the nascent blood bank work of Ian Wood and Lucy Meredith Bryce at the Hall Institute. When the war began, he gave over much of the institute's facilities and staff to the Australian Red Cross for wide- scale blood collection and storage, in addition to the blood typing of hundreds of thousands of service personnel. Having rejoined the Army Medical Directorate first as an honorary lieutenant colonel and Director of Hygiene (1939‚Äì40), and then honorary colonel and Director of Pathology (1940‚Äì42), Kellaway was also inducted into the Royal Australian Air Force's Flying Personnel Research Committee (FPRC). In 1941‚Äì42, at the behest of the British War Cabinet, Kellaway extensively toured the USA, Canada and the UK in order to facilitate inter-Allied collaboration on wartime medical research. This led, on his return, to Kellaway adopting the role of Scientific Liaison Officer to the Australian Army, serving on the Physiological Sub-committee of the Chemical Defence Board and chairing the Armoured Fighting Vehicles Committee, in addition to his ongoing FPRC contribution. While many of these roles were important from a coordination and direction perspective, their outcomes were less visible than other projects such as the Fairley's malaria research unit in Cairns. Kellaway's own laboratory work finally ceased in 1943. However, he was well aware that wartime demands had opened the coffers of the NH&MRC; and fostered a much greater commitment from the Commonwealth to supporting ‚Äì and indeed nurturing ‚Äì the Australian medical research culture that he had helped foster. Final years at the Wellcome Research Laboratories in Britain However, Kellaway did not participate in the large- scale reorganisation and support of medical research in post-war Australia. In 1943 ‚Äì almost certainly at the instigation of Henry Dale ‚Äì Kellaway was offered the post as Director of Scientific Policy at the Wellcome Research Laboratories in London (then within the Burroughs Wellcome company, now part of GlaxoSmithKline). Although reluctant to leave Australia, Kellaway accepted the invitation and ‚Äì with some reservations ‚Äì offered the directorship of the Hall Institute to Burnet. Kellaway remained in Australia until March 1944, by which time he had gained the rank of honorary Brigadier in the Army. Kellaway's years at the Wellcome did not permit him the opportunity to return to laboratory work, but his organisational skills, inspirational demeanour and scientific nous all contributed to the slow rebuilding of the company's research policy. Burroughs Wellcome faced near-bankruptcy in the early years after the war, but working with a new administrative team ‚Äì and fostering research directions at several of the company's locations including Britain, the USA and tropical stations ‚Äì new compounds came to be identified. These included effective treatments for motion sickness, malaria and schistosomiasis, which began to bear commercial fruit for Wellcome just as Kellaway was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1951. During the post-war years, he also participated actively in the Royal Society, acting as a councillor from 1947‚Äì52. Kellaway furthermore continued to promote the efforts and training of Australian researchers where he could. Despite undergoing numerous experimental treatments, however, he gradually succumbed to his inoperable cancer and died on 13 December 1952, never having returned to Australia. Personal qualities Beyond his scientific and institutional achievements, Kellaway was a talented bird photographer ‚Äì displaying his images in the Kodak shop in central Melbourne ‚Äì and became an able fly fisherman. He had an enduring love for the Australian bush and spent many of his holidays away from Melbourne, enjoying rough living in remote terrain. Kellaway married Eileen Ethel Scantlebury in 1919 and they had three sons: Frank Gerald (1922‚Äì2012), Charles William (1926) and Michael Hugh (1929). On his death, Kellaway attracted numerous glowing eulogies, reflecting not only his personal warmth and charm, but his good humour and willingness to help others. Moreover, his contribution in building the Hall Institute to world stature and fostering a supportive culture for medical research in Australia were lauded, although sadly these achievements have been neglected in subsequent years.

Based on a standard 12-bar blues progression, it was written by the band's frontman, Domingo \\"Sam\\" Samudio. It was released as a single on the small Memphis-based XL label (#906) in 1964 and was picked up in 1965 by MGM. The song was recorded at Sam C. Phillips Recording Studio at 639 Madison Avenue in Memphis, the successor to Phillips' original Sun Studio. It proved to be the only recording made at the studio to achieve national success. Chart history \\"Wooly Bully\\" was the band's first and biggest hit. It became a worldwide success, selling three million copies and reaching No. 2 on the American Hot 100 chart on June 5‚Äì12, 1965, kept off the top by The Beach Boys' \\"Help Me, Rhonda\\" and The Supremes' \\"Back in My Arms Again\\". \\"Wooly Bully\\" also went to No. 31 on the Hot Rhythm & Blues Singles chart. The song was the first American record to sell a million copies during the British Invasion and was influenced by the British rock sound which was mixed with traditional Mexican-American conjunto rhythms. It stayed in the Hot 100 for 18 weeks, the longest time for any song in 1965, and was nominated for a Grammy Award. It was named Billboard's number-one song of the year despite never reaching No. 1 on a weekly Hot 100; this feat was achieved again by Faith Hill's \\"Breathe\\" in 2000 and Lifehouse's \\"Hanging by a Moment\\" in 2001 (all three hits peaked at #2). On August 5, 1965, the single was certified as gold by the RIAA. It was later included on the band's 1965 album Wooly Bully, MGM SE4297. Title and lyrics \\"Wooly Bully\\" is a reworking of the 1962 tune \\"Hully Gully Now\\" on the Dallas-based Gay Shel label by Big Bo & The Arrows (vocal by Little Smitty), which was based on Junior Parker's \\"Feelin' Good\\". The song was given the green light after Sam rewrote the lyrics famously replacing \\"Hully Gully\\" with \\"Wooly Bully\\" and few additional lyrical changes. Sam retained the 'watch it, watch it now\\" refrain from the original version. The lyrics of \\"Wooly Bully\\" were hard to understand, and some radio stations banned the song. The lyrics describe a conversation between \\"Mattie\\" and \\"Hattie\\" concerning the \\"Wooly Bully\\" (a creature which Mattie describes as \\"a thing she saw [that] had two big horns and a wooly jaw\\") and the desirability of developing dancing skills, although no attempt is made to synthesize these divergent topics. The warning, \\"Let's not be L-7\\", means \\"Let's not be square\\", from the shape formed by the fingers making an L on one hand and a 7 on the other. Sam the Sham underscores the Tex-Mex nature of the song by counting out the rhythm in Spanish and English (\\"Uno! Dos! One, two, tres, cuatro!\\"), and the characteristic simple organ riffing. According to Sam: \\"The name of my cat was 'Wooly Bully', so I started from there. The count down part of the song was also not planned. I was just goofing around and counted off in Tex-Mex. It just blew everybody away, and actually, I wanted it taken off the record. We did three takes, all of them different, and they took the first take and released it.\\" Legacy Eddie and the Hot Rods released a version of the song as a single in the United Kingdom in 1976, but it did not chart.Eddie and the Hot Rods, \\"Wooly Bully\\" single release Retrieved June 21, 2016.

Besides twelve books of artistic and scholarly prose, his essays and short stories have been published in the Los Angeles Times, Partisan Review, North American Review, San Francisco Chronicle, Prism International, and many other American and Canadian periodicals. His fiction has also appeared in Russian, Polish, and Israeli journals. A three-time recipient of the New Jersey State Council on the Arts fellowships in writing, he has also received numerous grants for writing both fiction and non-fiction from the City University of New York. Draitser has given numerous public lectures and book talks at universities and cultural centers in the United States, Canada, UK, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, and Russia. Early life Draitser grew up in a Jewish family in the Soviet Union in the post-World War II years, in the anti-Semitic atmosphere of late Stalinism, at a time when Jews were forced to be silent about their religion and often tried to change their Jewish names. It was an oppressive childhood filled with suspicion and mistrust. As a young student, Draitser excelled at literature and decided that he wanted to be a journalist, despite his mother's preference that he study engineering. At that time, Jews attempting to enter the humanities encountered resistance, as Soviet system saw those areas as politically vulnerable and felt that Jews entering them would try to subvert the system. Despite this, Draitser earned degrees first in engineering, and later in journalism. Career Draitser has published both fiction and nonfiction since 1965. His work has appeared in leading Russian journals (including Youth, Literary Gazette, and Crocodile) under his pen name 'Emil Abramov'. He began his writing career as a freelancer contributing satirical articles to Soviet newspapers and magazines, though he had to be careful about what he wrote. For example, while he could criticize a particular factory for the poor workmanship of goods it produced, he could not criticize the economic system as a whole, although it became increasingly clear to him that the lack of competition that would inspire innovation combined with the Soviet mandate to guarantee work for all employees, regardless of their work ethic, made it impossible to produce quality products. Eventually, Draitser wrote an article critical of an important official which led to him being blacklisted, and prompted him to leave for the United States. In 1975, he settled in Los Angeles, where he earned a Ph.D. in Russian literature from the University of California, Los Angeles. In 1986, he accepted a position at Hunter College in New York City, where he continues to teach. His first book published in the United States, Forbidden Laughter (1980) brought him national attention. Feature articles on him and his book appeared in The New York Times, Washington Post, and the Los Angeles Times. He has appeared on NBC News with Tom Brokaw, the Merv Griffin Show, and National Public Radio. Draitser's research and writing have been supported by grants from the American Council of Learned Societies, the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture, the Social Science Foundation, and numerous grants from the City University of New York. A three-time recipient of fellowships from the New Jersey State Council on the Arts, he has been awarded residencies at the Vermont Arts Studios, Byrdcliffe Woodstock Art Colony, Renaissance House, and Banff Center for the Arts (Canada). Since spring 2009, he has been working on a sequel to his memoir Shush!, which covers his adulthood and move to the United States.

Procolophon, the genus after which the group was named, is unusual. Their skulls resemble the turtles', sharing a posttemporal fenestra. Accordingly, they have historically been classed alongside the turtles under the Anapsida. Up to the early Triassic, their teeth were sharp, indicating an insectivorous diet. Later in the Triassic their teeth became broader, indicating a switch to a herbivorous diet. They became extinct at the end of the Triassic. Discoveries announced in 2008 suggest that these animals may have lived in Antarctica in the Early Triassic, and were thus among the earliest tetrapods in the Antarctic.https://www.livescience.com/2580-fossils-suggest-ancient-cat-sized- reptiles-antarctica.html Hypsognathus.

After the death of the Munkatcher Rebbe, Yhoshua Leib Gould moved with his parents and four sisters to Sighet. His family became close to the Sigheter Rav, Rabbi Yekusiel Yehuda Teitelbaum, and he was Bar Mitzvahed in the synagogue of the Sigheter Rebbe. He was given semicha in Dayanut the same day. It was also in Sighet that he met the Satmar Rav, Yoel Teitelbaum for the first time. With the start of the war, rumors began to reach Hungary of the crimes being committed against the Jews. The elder Mr. Gould asked the Sigheter Rav whether he should flee or stay. He was told to stay, and was deported to Ukraine as slave labor. When he returned to Hungary the Sigheter Rav told him to take his family and flee to Romania. He did, but Yhoshua Leib remained behind to stay with the Sigheter Rebbe. The Germans invaded and they were deported to Auschwitz only to be liberated a few months later. Rabbi Yekusiel Yehuda did not survive, and Yhoshua Leib became loyal to the new Rav of Sighet, Moshe Teitelbaum. Yhoshua Leib moved to the Old City of Jerusalem, where he became involved first with Agudat Yisrael, then the Edah HaChareidis and a controversial splinter sect led by Amram Blau known as Neturei Karta. When the 1947‚Äì1949 Palestine war started, the Jordanian Legion captured the Old City, Yhoshua Leib fled first to Katamon and then to Meah Shearim. He worked for several years as a tutor and yeshivah rebbe, and even as a bricklayer and furniture carpenter. In 1957 he was appointed a chaver, or expert consultant, of the Edah HaChareidis, having been recognized as an expert in the laws of Marriage and Divorce, then considered important due to the large number of Agunahs following the Holocaust and 1948 war. Though employed by the Eidah Cheradit, he continued to stay in contact with Amram Blau and Moses Teitelbaum. It was during this time, at the insistence of Moses Teittelbaum, that Yhoshua Leib developed a connection to the Satmar Rav, Yoel Teitelbaum. Yhoshua Leib used his position in the Eidah Hareidis to defend Neturei Karta. Following the first Neturei Karta mission to Iran in 1999, he used his influence to convince the Edah HaChareidis to endorse that mission publicly. An endorsement was printed in the Edah HaChareidis newspaper, the Edah.The Edah, 27 Sivan He accepted the position of Rav (Rabbi) in Beis Midrash Tamar Avraham, the synagogue of Neturei Karta in Ramat Beit Shemesh. Gould died on 29 September 2009 from complications related to congestive heart failure. A succession feud for control of his independent wing of Neturei Karta erupted between his heir apparent, R' Avraham Tzvi Rothenberg, author of L'reyacha Kamocha, and Sephardi Neturei Karta scholar Chocham Neftali Maimon. Published works Yhoshua Gould is the author of several works on the Shulchan Aruch and Midrash Rabbah. The most well known is Lehitakfo Chalushin (\\"Strengthen the Weak\\"), a commentary on rabbi Shlomo Ganzfried's Kitzur Shulchan Aruch. Lehitakfo Chalushin comments on each paragraph, explaining various opinions on each law and clarifying if the law as brought down by the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch is a leniency, stringency, or the principle Halachah. He defines principle Halachah as the opinion held by the majority of Ashkenazi commentators.Lahitakfo Chalushin, Introduction The work also contains strong reproof for those lenient with various laws, drawing on imagery from Reshit Chochmah and other Musar literature. The introduction to Chapter 152 discusses the laws of premarital physical contact between men and women, homosexuality, and lesbianism. These laws were absent in the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch. The introduction to the work states explicitly that it was written for Modern Orthodox youth, converts to Judaism, and the newly religious. The work was hailed as an important contribution by a few in the Haredi community despite comments critical of Agudat Israel. His approach to the prohibition of unmarried women going to the mikveh was viewed as controversial in light of Rabbi Moshe Feinstein's response on the subject in Iggros Moshe. Controversy An organ of the National Religious Party political party in Israel suggested Yhoshua Gould be brought up on charges for incitement due to his ruling that seminary deans and Rosh Yeshivas who give inappropriately lenient rulings to their students could be physically harmed if the matter involved questions of faith, matters of bloodshed, or sexual sins.Our Velt, \\"Here We go Again,\\" Rivka Ella Green, Nov. 2005 He writes, \\"The fools are thieves, makers of prostitutes, and murderers in two worlds. About them it is written, 'He who sheds the blood of an evildoer is considered to have brought a pleasing sacrifice.' (Bamidbar Rabbah, Pinchas)\\"At a public lecture at Yeshiva Omrei Emes in October 2005, Gould slapped a yeshivah student who said there is no prohibition in Torah Law against lesbianism.

This went beyond the higher criticism of the T√ºbingen school which (with the exception of Bruno Bauer) held that a core of at least four epistles had been written by Paul of Tarsus in the 1st century. Dutch Radical School The Dutch school of radical criticism started in 1878 with a publication by Allard Pierson, who denied Pauline authorship of Galatians. He was fiercely attacked by his colleague Abraham Dirk Loman, but two years later, also Loman abandoned the historicity of Paul. Similarly, Willem Christiaan van Manen, who had written a doctoral thesis defending the authenticity of 1 Thessalonians, wrote in 1889 that he had come to the same conclusions as Loman. Also, the philosopher Gerardus Johannes Petrus Josephus Bolland was a part of the movement. With the death of Van Manen's student Gustaaf Adolf van den Bergh van Eysinga in 1957, the line of scholarship at Dutch universities came to an end. The name \\"Dutch Radicals\\" was coined by Loman, in an 1887 article reviewing Edwin Johnson (\\"Antiqua Mater: A Study of Christian Origins\\", 1887), saying that \\"the author is a radical like we seldom meet among theologians and hardly ever among English theologians\\". The RadikalKritik article on van Manen and the Dutch Radicals adds that \\"Van Manen later spoke of the 'radical' or the 'Dutch' school (1902). The 'radical' scholars did not want to be impeded by church canons and wanted to be free in their research of the New Testament and of the history of early Christianity. This research led them to the conclusion that we do not have any authentic Pauline epistles.\\" The Dutch school also influenced Rudolf Steck in Switzerland, and Arthur Drews in Germany. However, the works of Adolf Harnack proved more influential, and radical criticism was almost forgotten until it was unearthed by the Journal of Higher Criticism in the United States. It is now richly documented in the RadikalKritik site managed by Dr. Hermann Detering, who is reviving the complete scholarship of Radical Criticism of the Dutch Radical School, with reviews of all its members and analyses of their works, including many articles in English. Hermann Detering's site also follows current controversies from the US, such as the criticisms raised about Bart Ehrman's recent publication of Did Jesus Exist? (2012), and about the series of articles published by R. Joseph Hoffmann on his blog The New Oxonian, called The Jesus Process: A Consultation on the Historical Jesus. Reception Members of the Radical Dutch School argued against the existence of Jesus, which caused controversy. Robert Van Voorst wrote that \\"their arguments were stoutly attacked in the Netherlands, especially by other scholars, but largely ignored out it.\\"Van Voorst, Robert E. (2000).

It was built to house what was then known as the Emerald Hill Town Council, as well as a Public Hall, a Mechanics Institute and Library, the Post and Telegraph Department, the Police Department and Courthouse and Fire Brigade. South Melbourne Town Hall in 1880 In the 1930s some interior elements were refurbished and new council chamber furniture was installed, designed by Oakley and Parkes. The Town Hall was built on an elevated site, the centrepiece of a formally planned block, with a forecourt in the form of a small curved park. It was built in the Victorian Academic Classical style with French Second Empire features, dominated by a very tall multi-stage clock tower. The building is on the Victorian Heritage Register, along with the park and the 1905 Boer War memorial in front. In 1994, the Cities of South Melbourne, Port Melbourne and St Kilda were amalgamated to form the new City of Port Phillip. The new council administration was centred at the St Kilda Town Hall, with only secondary offices retained at the South Melbourne Town Hall. That same year, the Federal Government created the Australian National Academy of Music (ANAM), which became the main occupant of the building. ANAM is the national centre for the further development of musicians with outstanding talent in Australia, and the hall has become a concert venue. The building was restored in 2004 thanks to a state government heritage grant, enabling the reinstatement of the decorative roof and iron cresting (removed in 1945), and restoration of the original ochre exterior colour. In 2012 Multicultural Arts Victoria, Victoria's peak arts organisation promoting cultural diversity in the arts, moved their home to the South Melbourne Town Hall.

He is one of the numerous great-nephews of Baron of Buttlar-Bradenfels, Hans Treusch. He started as a fashion designer. He was born on 13 July 1961, near D√ºsseldorf, Germany, to French parents. He moved to Paris in 1965. There he studied art and architecture and collaborated with Karl Lagerfeld's team for a few years. He then moved on to work with Helmut Lang's society until he became head of his own label, Cardino, in 1985. He indeed founded his own house in the same year and began with haute couture in 1986. Guarrigue-Lef√®vre was known for his renaissance age style and designs. He prefers conservative, classical shapes and motifs, and loved to emphasize the human body's natural forms and curves. He advanced into unisex fashions, sometimes experimental, and not always practical. Guarrigue-Lef√®vre was one of the first couturiers to turn to Asia, and notably Japan, as a high fashion market when he travelled there in 1990. In 1991, he became of the UNESCO Goodwill Ambassadors. Unfortunately, in 1994, he was expelled from the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture et du Pr√™t-√†-Porter and from the Maison du Haute Couture for launching a ready-to-wear collection for the Printemps department store without permission from the chamber. He tried to launch his Cardino collection on his own, but his notoriety was not enough to re-conquer the high fashion market, and despite of his previous experience, his name and work were disliked by the public. Angry and disappointed, Guarrigue-Lef√®vre then disappeared from the scene for a few years. According from several sources, he supposedly left to Argentina with his family to enjoy the fruit of his work. He did not let this failure condemn him though, and finally reappeared to the scene in May 2001, where he purchased a few restaurants in Paris, including Le Chaudron. In 2005, Guarrigue-Lef√®vre founded Paris √âlys√©e Private Club, more widely known as Paris √âlys√©e. The club first opened his door to Parisian elite in June of this year. Guarrigue-Lef√®vre then expanded his clientele by inviting several members of the European Elite in late 2005. The club is now opened to a more international clientele. Guarrigue-Lef√®vre is now partner with Alphonse Ruiz de Turckeim, third son of the Marquis Ruiz de Turckeim. Guarrigue-Lef√®vre owns the ruins of a castle in Bonnieux, Vaucluse. He has partially renovated the site and regularly organizes theatre festivals there.

In mathematics, specifically projective geometry, a configuration in the plane consists of a finite set of points, and a finite arrangement of lines, such that each point is incident to the same number of lines and each line is incident to the same number of points.In the literature, the terms projective configuration and tactical configuration of type (1,1) are also used to describe configurations as defined here. Although certain specific configurations had been studied earlier (for instance by Thomas Kirkman in 1849), the formal study of configurations was first introduced by Theodor Reye in 1876, in the second edition of his book Geometrie der Lage, in the context of a discussion of Desargues' theorem. Ernst Steinitz wrote his dissertation on the subject in 1894, and they were popularized by Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen's 1932 book Anschauliche Geometrie, reprinted in English . Configurations may be studied either as concrete sets of points and lines in a specific geometry, such as the Euclidean or projective planes (these are said to be realizable in that geometry), or as a type of abstract incidence geometry. In the latter case they are closely related to regular hypergraphs and biregular bipartite graphs, but with some additional restrictions: every two points of the incidence structure can be associated with at most one line, and every two lines can be associated with at most one point. That is, the girth of the corresponding bipartite graph (the Levi graph of the configuration) must be at least six. Notation A configuration in the plane is denoted by (), where is the number of points, the number of lines, the number of lines per point, and the number of points per line. These numbers necessarily satisfy the equation :p\\\\gamma = \\\\ell\\\\pi\\\\, as this product is the number of point-line incidences (flags). Configurations having the same symbol, say (), need not be isomorphic as incidence structures. For instance, there exist three different (93 93) configurations: the Pappus configuration and two less notable configurations. In some configurations, and consequently, . These are called symmetric or balanced configurations and the notation is often condensed to avoid repetition. For example, (93 93) abbreviates to (93). Examples A (103) configuration that is not incidence-isomorphic to a Desargues configuration Notable projective configurations include the following: * (11), the simplest possible configuration, consisting of a point incident to a line. Often excluded as being trivial. * (32), the triangle. Each of its three sides meets two of its three vertices, and vice versa. More generally any polygon of sides forms a configuration of type () * (43 62) and (62 43), the complete quadrangle and complete quadrilateral respectively. * (73), the Fano plane. This configuration exists as an abstract incidence geometry, but cannot be constructed in the Euclidean plane. * (83), the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor configuration. This configuration describes two quadrilaterals that are simultaneously inscribed and circumscribed in each other. It cannot be constructed in Euclidean plane geometry but the equations defining it have nontrivial solutions in complex numbers. * (93), the Pappus configuration. * (94 123), the Hesse configuration of nine inflection points of a cubic curve in the complex projective plane and the twelve lines determined by pairs of these points. This configuration shares with the Fano plane the property that it contains every line through its points; configurations with this property are known as Sylvester‚ÄìGallai configurations due to the Sylvester‚ÄìGallai theorem that shows that they cannot be given real-number coordinates . * (103), the Desargues configuration. * (124 163), the Reye configuration. * (125 302), the Schl√§fli double six, formed by 12 of the 27 lines on a cubic surface * (153), the Cremona‚ÄìRichmond configuration, formed by the 15 lines complementary to a double six and their 15 tangent planes * (166), the Kummer configuration. * (214), the Gr√ºnbaum‚ÄìRigby configuration. * (273), the Gray configuration * (354), Danzer's configuration., * (6015), the Klein configuration. Duality of configurations The projective dual of a configuration () is a () configuration in which the roles of \\"point\\" and \\"line\\" are exchanged. Types of configurations therefore come in dual pairs, except when taking the dual results in an isomorphic configuration. These exceptions are called self-dual configurations and in such cases . The number of () configurations The number of nonisomorphic configurations of type (), starting at , is given by the sequence :1, 1, 3, 10, 31, 229, 2036, 21399, 245342, ... These numbers count configurations as abstract incidence structures, regardless of realizability . As discusses, nine of the ten (103) configurations, and all of the (113) and (123) configurations, are realizable in the Euclidean plane, but for each there is at least one nonrealizable () configuration. Gropp also points out a long-lasting error in this sequence: an 1895 paper attempted to list all (123) configurations, and found 228 of them, but the 229th configuration was not discovered until 1988. Constructions of symmetric configurations There are several techniques for constructing configurations, generally starting from known configurations. Some of the simplest of these techniques construct symmetric () configurations. Any finite projective plane of order is an (( configuration. Let be a projective plane of order . Remove from a point and all the lines of which pass through (but not the points which lie on those lines except for ) and remove a line not passing through and all the points that are on line . The result is a configuration of type ((. If, in this construction, the line is chosen to be a line which does pass through , then the construction results in a configuration of type ((. Since projective planes are known to exist for all orders which are powers of primes, these constructions provide infinite families of symmetric configurations. Not all configurations are realizable, for instance, a (437) configuration does not exist.This configuration would be a projective plane of order 6 which does not exist by the Bruck‚ÄìRyser theorem. However, has provided a construction which shows that for , a () configuration exists for all , where is the length of an optimal Golomb ruler of order . Unconventional configurations Higher dimensions The Schl√§fli double six. The concept of a configuration may be generalized to higher dimensions , for instance to points and lines or planes in space. In such cases, the restrictions that no two points belong to more than one line may be relaxed, because it is possible for two points to belong to more than one plane. Notable three-dimensional configurations are the M√∂bius configuration, consisting of two mutually inscribed tetrahedra, Reye's configuration, consisting of twelve points and twelve planes, with six points per plane and six planes per point, the Gray configuration consisting of a 3√ó3√ó3 grid of 27 points and the 27 orthogonal lines through them, and the Schl√§fli double six, a configuration with 30 points, 12 lines, two lines per point, and five points per line. Topological configurations Configuration in the projective plane that is realized by points and pseudolines is called topological configuration . For instance, it is known that there exsit no point-line (194) configurations, however, there exists a topological configuration with these parameters. Configurations of points and circles Another generalization of the concept of a configuration concerns configurations of points and circles, a notable example being the (83 64) Miquel configuration .

Major benefits of nanotechnology include improved manufacturing methods, water purification systems, energy systems, physical enhancement, nanomedicine, better food production methods, nutrition and large-scale infrastructure auto-fabrication. Nanotechnology's reduced size may allow for automation of tasks which were previously inaccessible due to physical restrictions, which in turn may reduce labor, land, or maintenance requirements placed on humans. Potential risks include environmental, health, and safety issues; transitional effects such as displacement of traditional industries as the products of nanotechnology become dominant, which are of concern to privacy rights advocates. These may be particularly important if potential negative effects of nanoparticles are overlooked. Whether nanotechnology merits special government regulation is a controversial issue. Regulatory bodies such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Health and Consumer Protection Directorate of the European Commission have started dealing with the potential risks of nanoparticles. The organic food sector has been the first to act with the regulated exclusion of engineered nanoparticles from certified organic produce, firstly in Australia and the UK,Paull, John (2010), Nanotechnology: No Free Lunch, Platter, 1(1) 8-17 and more recently in Canada, as well as for all food certified to Demeter International standardsPaull, John (2011) \\"Nanomaterials in food and agriculture: The big issue of small matter for organic food and farming\\", In: Neuhoff, Daniel; Halberg, Niels; Rasmussen, I.A.; Hermansen, J.E.; Ssekyewa, Charles and Sohn, Sang Mok (Eds.) Proceedings of the Third Scientific Conference of ISOFAR, ISOFAR, Bonn, 2, pp. 96-99. Overview The presence of nanomaterials (materials that contain nanoparticles) is not in itself a threat. It is only certain aspects that can make them risky, in particular their mobility and their increased reactivity. Only if certain properties of certain nanoparticles were harmful to living beings or the environment would we be faced with a genuine hazard. In this case it can be called nanopollution. In addressing the health and environmental impact of nanomaterials we need to differentiate between two types of nanostructures: (1) Nanocomposites, nanostructured surfaces and nanocomponents (electronic, optical, sensors etc.), where nanoscale particles are incorporated into a substance, material or device (‚Äúfixed‚Äù nano- particles); and (2) ‚Äúfree‚Äù nanoparticles, where at some stage in production or use individual nanoparticles of a substance are present. These free nanoparticles could be nanoscale species of elements, or simple compounds, but also complex compounds where for instance a nanoparticle of a particular element is coated with another substance (‚Äúcoated‚Äù nanoparticle or ‚Äúcore- shell‚Äù nanoparticle). There seems to be consensus that, although one should be aware of materials containing fixed nanoparticles, the immediate concern is with free nanoparticles. Nanoparticles are very different from their everyday counterparts, so their adverse effects cannot be derived from the known toxicity of the macro-sized material. This poses significant issues for addressing the health and environmental impact of free nanoparticles. To complicate things further, in talking about nanoparticles it is important that a powder or liquid containing nanoparticles almost never be monodisperse, but contain instead a range of particle sizes. This complicates the experimental analysis as larger nanoparticles might have different properties from smaller ones. Also, nanoparticles show a tendency to aggregate, and such aggregates often behave differently from individual nanoparticles. Health impact A video on the health and safety implications of nanotechnology The health impacts of nanotechnology are the possible effects that the use of nanotechnological materials and devices will have on human health. As nanotechnology is an emerging field, there is great debate regarding to what extent nanotechnology will benefit or pose risks for human health. Nanotechnology's health impacts can be split into two aspects: the potential for nanotechnological innovations to have medical applications to cure disease, and the potential health hazards posed by exposure to nanomaterials. Medical applications Nanomedicine is the medical application of nanotechnology.Nanomedicine, Volume I: Basic Capabilities , by Robert A. Freitas Jr. 1999, The approaches to nanomedicine range from the medical use of nanomaterials, to nanoelectronic biosensors, and even possible future applications of molecular nanotechnology. Nanomedicine seeks to deliver a valuable set of research tools and clinically helpful devices in the near future. The National Nanotechnology Initiative expects new commercial applications in the pharmaceutical industry that may include advanced drug delivery systems, new therapies, and in vivo imaging.Nanotechnology in Medicine and the Biosciences, by Coombs RRH, Robinson DW. 1996, Neuro- electronic interfaces and other nanoelectronics-based sensors are another active goal of research. Further down the line, the speculative field of molecular nanotechnology believes that cell repair machines could revolutionize medicine and the medical field. Nanomedicine research is directly funded, with the US National Institutes of Health in 2005 funding a five-year plan to set up four nanomedicine centers. In April 2006, the journal Nature Materials estimated that 130 nanotech-based drugs and delivery systems were being developed worldwide. Nanomedicine is a large industry, with nanomedicine sales reaching $6.8 billion in 2004. With over 200 companies and 38 products worldwide, a minimum of $3.8 billion in nanotechnology R&D; is being invested every year.Nanotechnology: A Gentle Introduction to the Next Big Idea, by MA Ratner, D Ratner. 2002, As the nanomedicine industry continues to grow, it is expected to have a significant impact on the economy. Health hazards Nanotoxicology is the field which studies potential health risks of nanomaterials. The extremely small size of nanomaterials means that they are much more readily taken up by the human body than larger sized particles. How these nanoparticles behave inside the organism is one of the significant issues that needs to be resolved. The behavior of nanoparticles is a function of their size, shape and surface reactivity with the surrounding tissue. For example, they could cause overload on phagocytes, cells that ingest and destroy foreign matter, thereby triggering stress reactions that lead to inflammation and weaken the body's defense against other pathogens. Apart from what happens if non-degradable or slowly degradable nanoparticles accumulate in organs, another concern is their potential interaction with biological processes inside the body: because of their large surface, nanoparticles on exposure to tissue and fluids will immediately adsorb onto their surface some of the macromolecules they encounter. This may, for instance, affect the regulatory mechanisms of enzymes and other proteins. The large number of variables influencing toxicity means that it is difficult to generalise about health risks associated with exposure to nanomaterials ‚Äì each new nanomaterial must be assessed individually and all material properties must be taken into account. Health and environmental issues combine in the workplace of companies engaged in producing or using nanomaterials and in the laboratories engaged in nanoscience and nanotechnology research. It is safe to say that current workplace exposure standards for dusts cannot be applied directly to nanoparticle dusts. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has conducted initial research on how nanoparticles interact with the body's systems and how workers might be exposed to nano-sized particles in the manufacturing or industrial use of nanomaterials. NIOSH currently offers interim guidelines for working with nanomaterials consistent with the best scientific knowledge. At The National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory of NIOSH, studies investigating the filter penetration of nanoparticles on NIOSH-certified and EU marked respirators, as well as non- certified dust masks have been conducted. These studies found that the most penetrating particle size range was between 30 and 100 nanometers, and leak size was the largest factor in the number of nanoparticles found inside the respirators of the test dummies. Other properties of nanomaterials that influence toxicity include: chemical composition, shape, surface structure, surface charge, aggregation and solubility, and the presence or absence of functional groups of other chemicals. The large number of variables influencing toxicity means that it is difficult to generalise about health risks associated with exposure to nanomaterials ‚Äì each new nanomaterial must be assessed individually and all material properties must be taken into account. Literature reviews have been showing that release of engineered nanoparticles and incurred personal exposure can happen during different work activities. The situation alerts regulatory bodies to necessitate prevention strategies and regulations at nanotechnology workplaces. Environmental impact The environmental impact of nanotechnology is the possible effects that the use of nanotechnological materials and devices will have on the environment. As nanotechnology is an emerging field, there is debate regarding to what extent industrial and commercial use of nanomaterials will affect organisms and ecosystems. Nanotechnology's environmental impact can be split into two aspects: the potential for nanotechnological innovations to help improve the environment, and the possibly novel type of pollution that nanotechnological materials might cause if released into the environment.  Environmental applications  Green nanotechnology refers to the use of nanotechnology to enhance the environmental sustainability of processes producing negative externalities. It also refers to the use of the products of nanotechnology to enhance sustainability. It includes making green nano- products and using nano-products in support of sustainability. Green nanotechnology has been described as the development of clean technologies, \\"to minimize potential environmental and human health risks associated with the manufacture and use of nanotechnology products, and to encourage replacement of existing products with new nano-products that are more environmentally friendly throughout their lifecycle.\\" Green nanotechnology has two goals: producing nanomaterials and products without harming the environment or human health, and producing nano-products that provide solutions to environmental problems. It uses existing principles of green chemistry and green engineeringWhat is Green Engineering, US Environmental Protection Agency to make nanomaterials and nano-products without toxic ingredients, at low temperatures using less energy and renewable inputs wherever possible, and using lifecycle thinking in all design and engineering stages. Pollution Nanopollution is a generic name for all waste generated by nanodevices or during the nanomaterials manufacturing process. Nanowaste is mainly the group of particles that are released into the environment, or the particles that are thrown away when still on their products. Social impact Beyond the toxicity risks to human health and the environment which are associated with first-generation nanomaterials, nanotechnology has broader societal impact and poses broader social challenges. Social scientists have suggested that nanotechnology's social issues should be understood and assessed not simply as \\"downstream\\" risks or impacts. Rather, the challenges should be factored into \\"upstream\\" research and decision-making in order to ensure technology development that meets social objectives Many social scientists and organizations in civil society suggest that technology assessment and governance should also involve public participation.Demos Publications Governing at the Nanoscale Over 800 nano- related patents were granted in 2003, with numbers increasing to nearly 19,000 internationally by 2012. Corporations are already taking out broad-ranging patents on nanoscale discoveries and inventions. For example, two corporations, NEC and IBM, hold the basic patents on carbon nanotubes, one of the current cornerstones of nanotechnology. Carbon nanotubes have a wide range of uses, and look set to become crucial to several industries from electronics and computers, to strengthened materials to drug delivery and diagnostics. Nanotechnologies may provide new solutions for the millions of people in developing countries who lack access to basic services, such as safe water, reliable energy, health care, and education. The 2004 UN Task Force on Science, Technology and Innovation noted that some of the advantages of nanotechnology include production using little labor, land, or maintenance, high productivity, low cost, and modest requirements for materials and energy. However, concerns are frequently raised that the claimed benefits of nanotechnology will not be evenly distributed, and that any benefits (including technical and/or economic) associated with nanotechnology will only reach affluent nations. Longer-term concerns center on the impact that new technologies will have for society at large, and whether these could possibly lead to either a post-scarcity economy, or alternatively exacerbate the wealth gap between developed and developing nations. The effects of nanotechnology on the society as a whole, on human health and the environment, on trade, on security, on food systems and even on the definition of \\"human\\", have not been characterized or politicized.  Regulation  Significant debate exists relating to the question of whether nanotechnology or nanotechnology-based products merit special government regulation. This debate is related to the circumstances in which it is necessary and appropriate to assess new substances prior to their release into the market, community and environment. Regulatory bodies such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S. or the Health & Consumer Protection Directorate of the European Commission have started dealing with the potential risks posed by nanoparticles. So far, neither engineered nanoparticles nor the products and materials that contain them are subject to any special regulation regarding production, handling or labelling. The Material Safety Data Sheet that must be issued for some materials often does not differentiate between bulk and nanoscale size of the material in question and even when it does these MSDS are advisory only. Limited nanotechnology labeling and regulation may exacerbate potential human and environmental health and safety issues associated with nanotechnology. It has been argued that the development of comprehensive regulation of nanotechnology will be vital to ensure that the potential risks associated with the research and commercial application of nanotechnology do not overshadow its potential benefits. Regulation may also be required to meet community expectations about responsible development of nanotechnology, as well as ensuring that public interests are included in shaping the development of nanotechnology. In \\"The Consumer Product Safety Commission and Nanotechnology,\\" E. Marla Felcher suggests that the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which is charged with protecting the public against unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with consumer products, is ill-equipped to oversee the safety of complex, high-tech products made using nanotechnology.Felcher, EM.

He helped Tyrone win the 2003, 2005 and 2008 All-Ireland Finals, and played for the Cookstown Fr. Rock's club. His talent on the pitch marked him out as one of his generation's bright young stars of football. Underage achievements At underage level, Mulligan's success is prolific. He achieved notable success with Cookstown Father Rock's from Under 12 upwards, collecting county leagues and championships. As an Under-18, he reached the All-Ireland final in 1997 and 1998, (which includes two Ulster titles), scoring a goal in the 1998 final, and was part of the Tyrone Vocational Schools team that won the All-Ireland in 1998, although a broken arm prevented him playing in the final. As a pupil at Holy Trinity College, Cookstown, where he was a pupil of former Tyrone Footballing great Peter Canavan, Mulligan won the Tyrone, Ulster and All- Ireland Championships also in 1998. Senior career Mulligan was part of the Tyrone team that won the All-Irelands in 2003, 2005 and 2008. He made an immediate splash to his senior career against local rivals Armagh by scoring a goal in the first thirty seconds. However, his contribution to the game was stifled after that and he was replaced at half time. His best-remembered performance is probably against Dublin in the drawn All-Ireland Quarter Final in 2005, when he scored what the Irish Independent described as \\"what can definitely be called one of the greatest goals of all time.\\" When Tyrone were on the backfoot, Mulligan picked up a pass from Stephen O'Neill on the 45m line. He turned his marker, and started heading goalward, dummying two more defenders out of the tackle, and shooting the ball past an oncoming Dublin player and the goalie to rocket the net. This performance almost single- handedly earned him the Ulster writers Player of the Month award. In the replay, 'Mugsy' showed that he had returned to form by scoring 1-07, and was named the Man of the Match in the 2005 All-Ireland Final, including deftly setting up Tyrone's winning goal with a huge catch, and perfectly timed lay off to Peter Canavan. His disciplinary record became a talking point in 2007, having been sent off twice in the 2007 National League, and allegedly dropped from the team by manager, Mickey Harte, during the campaign for not showing up to training due to work commitments. Whilst in Brisbane, Australia 2000 he played a key role for Shamrocks Gaelic Football Club in winning the 2000 Queensland Gaelic Football Championship. Outside football Mulligan also represented Tyrone in the 1996 Milk Cup, and played under 15 soccer in Canada. As a student, he was under the tutelage of Tyrone great, Peter Canavan, who often managed him in the school football team. As Mulligan rose up the ranks, the two players played together on the Tyrone team in the late nineties.

The arena is owned and operated by the Fairbanks North Star Borough. Originally constructed as an airplane hangar for the Lend-Lease program in Tanacross, southeast of Fairbanks, the building was dismantled, transported to Fairbanks and reassembled in 1968. It has undergone two major renovations since then. The building is home to the Fairbanks Ice Dogs ice hockey team. The borough's parks and recreation department is headquartered in the building. History Prior to 1968, the building now known as the Big Dipper was an aircraft hangar located in Tanacross, Alaska. Constructed during World War II, the building saw little use after the war. In 1968, Hez Ray, a teacher and coach at Lathrop High School, organized a crew of high school students and volunteers and undertook a project to move the derelict hangar to Fairbanks and repurpose it as an ice skating arena. Coach Ray's initial group of boys were ‚ÄúFirst Boots on the Ground‚Äù in the beginning of the enormous project. The incredible story of this adventure is in Coach Ray's book ‚ÄúThe Big Dipper, A Dream is Born‚Äù. (Copyright Hez Ray, 2014) () The group purchased the hangar for a dollar and, using equipment donated by Fairbanks construction companies, dismantled the building and moved it to Fairbanks. The volunteers then reconstructed the building in its present location from the dismantled parts of the hangar. After rebuilding the hangar, the volunteers built an ice rink and bleachers inside, but due to a lack of resources the building itself was reconstructed essentially as it had been in Tanacross. Heated restrooms and locker rooms with showers were added in 1972‚Äì1973. The building itself remained unheated until its 1980s renovation, with large portable space heaters normally associated with airplane hangars used on occasion in the winter, in an attempt to provide some heat to the facility during events. The Alaska Gold Kings, a hockey team which began in 1975 as a league team sponsored by the Teamsters Union Local 959, played at the Dipper for their two seasons as a minor-pro team in the West Coast Hockey League before moving to Colorado Springs, Colorado. The World Eskimo Indian Olympics was held in the building for most of its existence. When the Dipper was unavailable due to renovations, WEIO decided to hold their 2007 event at the Sullivan Arena in Anchorage, the first time it was held outside of Fairbanks. As an enticement to remain in Fairbanks, WEIO was offered the Carlson Center in place of the Dipper for future events, where it has been held since.

He was an influential journalist and top insider in Washington from 1945 to the late 1960s, often in conjunction with his brother Stewart Alsop. Early life Alsop was born on October 10, 1910, in Avon, Connecticut, to Joseph Wright Alsop IV (1876‚Äì1953) and Corinne Douglas Robinson (1886‚Äì1971). Through his mother, he was related to Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and James Monroe. Both of Alsop's parents were active in Republican politics. His father unsuccessfully sought the governorship of Connecticut several times, his mother founded the Connecticut League of Republican Women in 1917, and both served in the Connecticut General Assembly, as did his younger brother John deKoven Alsop. Alsop graduated from the Groton School, a private boarding school in Groton, Massachusetts, in 1928, and from Harvard University in 1932. He wrote for The Harvard Crimson during his time at Harvard. Journalism career After college, Alsop became a reporter, then an unusual career for someone with an Ivy League diploma. He began his career with the New York Herald Tribune and fast established a substantial reputation as a journalist, particularly by his comprehensive reportage of the Bruno Hauptmann trial in 1934. Because of his family ties to the Roosevelts, Alsop soon became well- connected in Franklin Roosevelt's Washington. By 1936, The Saturday Evening Post had awarded him a contract to write about politics with fellow journalist Turner Catledge. Two years later, the North American Newspaper Alliance (NANA) contracted Alsop and Robert E. Kintner to write a nationally syndicated column on a daily basis. His first book The 168 Days (1938), covering Roosevelt's unsuccessful campaign to enlarge the Supreme Court, became a bestseller. In 1940 Alsop and Kintner moved from NANA to the New York Herald Tribune. In 1941, after it had become clear that the United States would soon enter World War II, Alsop and Kintner suspended their column and volunteered for the armed forces. Alsop entered the US Navy and used his political connections to be assigned as Staff Historian to Claire Lee Chennault's American Volunteer Group, later famous as the Flying Tigers, while the group was training at Toungoo, Burma. While on a supply mission for Chennault late in the fall of 1941, he found himself in Hong Kong on December 7. Unable to secure passage out of the city, Alsop was eventually taken into custody as an enemy alien and interned at Hong Kong by the Japanese. After six months he was repatriated through a prisoner exchange as a journalist, but he had really been a combatant, a fact he managed to conceal by changing into civilian clothes and with the help of friends. He traveled back to the United States on the neutral liner Gripsholm. He returned to China as a civilian Lend-lease administrator in the fall of 1942, assigned to the wartime capital, Chungking. He eventually rejoined Chennault in Kunming, China and served with him for the remaining months of the war. After the war, Alsop resumed his journalism career, now working with his brother Stewart to produce a thrice-weekly piece, called \\"Matter of Fact\\", for the Herald Tribune. The use of the word \\"fact\\" reflected Alsop's pride in producing a column based on reporting, rather than the opinion pieces of many other columnists. Stewart remained headquartered in Washington to cover domestic politics, and Joseph traveled the world, covering foreign affairs. Alsop also helped the CIA in its intelligence-gathering activities, using his status as a foreign correspondent as cover. In 1953, Alsop covered Philippine elections at the CIA's request. The partnership of the Alsop brothers lasted from 1945 until 1958. Joseph became the sole author of \\"Matter of Fact\\" and he moved to The Washington Post until his retirement in 1974. The Alsops once described themselves as \\"Republicans by inheritance and registration, and... conservatives by political conviction.\\" Despite his identity as a conservative Republican, however, Alsop was an early supporter of the presidential ambitions of Democrat John F. Kennedy and became a close friend and influential adviser to Kennedy after his election, in November 1960. Additionally, \\"while Stewart was more liberal than Joseph, he nonetheless characterized both of them as 'New Deal liberals'\\". Joseph Alsop was a vocal supporter of America's involvement in Vietnam, which led to bitter breaks with many of his liberal friends and a decline in the influence of his column. In 1963, he became the first to make public the \\"Menali affair\\", revealing in a column entitled \\"Very Ugly Stuff\\" that Mieczys≈Çaw Maneli, the Polish Commissioner to the International Control Commission had twice met Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu, the younger brother and right-hand man of President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám of South Vietnam. Maneli had come bearing an offer for South Vietnam to be neutral in the Cold War and for a federation with North Vietnam. Alsop had visited Saigon, where Nhu leaked the meeting to him. Alsop wrote \\"the facts all too clearly point to a French intrigue...to defeat American policy [in South Vietnam].\\" Personal life In 1961, he married Susan Mary Jay Patten, daughter of diplomat Peter Augustus Jay, a descendant of John Jay, and the widow of William Patten, an American diplomat who was one of Alsop's friends. By this marriage he had two stepchildren, William and Anne. The couple divorced in 1978. A noted art connoisseur and collector, Alsop delivered six lectures at the National Gallery of Art in Washington on The History of Art Collecting in the summer of 1978. He was at work on a memoir when he died at his home in the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C., on August 28, 1989. He is buried at Indian Hill Cemetery, Middletown, Connecticut.Wilson, Scott. Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons, 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Location 999). McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition. The memoir was published posthumously as I've Seen the Best of It. Sexuality Alsop kept his homosexuality a closely guarded secret all of his life. Richard Helms called him \\"a scrupulously closeted homosexual.\\" Nevertheless, Senator Joseph McCarthy insinuated that Alsop was homosexual in the course of a dispute with The Saturday Evening Post about its coverage of his campaign to remove \\"perverts\\" from government employment. When McCarthy implied that Alsop was not \\"healthy and normal,\\" a Post editor vouched for him: \\"I know Alsop well, and I know he is a man of high character, with great courage and integrity.\\"; Early in 1957, the KGB photographed him in a hotel room in Moscow while he was having sex with another man, an agent of the Soviet Union. He rebuffed Soviet attempts at blackmail, instead writing \\"a detailed account of the incident and a relevant narrative history of his sex life.\\" It has been described as \\"brimming with revelations about Alsop's sex life on several continents,\\" including a report that one of his lovers was Arthur H. Vandenberg Jr., who had resigned as Dwight Eisenhower's appointments secretary in 1953. His accounts, delivered to a friend in the CIA, quickly reached the FBI, allowing J. Edgar Hoover to spread the information through the Eisenhower administration, many of whose members had fought sharp battles with Alsop. Hoover told President Lyndon B. Johnson about the Moscow incident in 1964,Beschloss, p. 145. and Johnson told Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara about Alsop's FBI file.Beschloss, p. 150. In 1965, Alsop complained to friends that Johnson was tapping his phone, a claim that infuriated Johnson, who believed that he had protected Alsop from McCarthy's attacks. Alsop told White House Press Secretary Bill Moyers that he believed the administration was tapping his phone and was spreading gossip about his personal life, all in an attempt to stop leaks. When Moyers reported the charges, Johnson ordered Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach to be certain no such wiretap was in place and protested that he never ordered one: \\"I'm as innocent of it as I am of murdering your wife,\\" he told Katzenbach.Beschloss, pp. 251‚Äì254, 260. In the 1970s, the Soviets sent the aforementioned photos to several prominent American journalists without adverse consequences. Alsop considered making his homosexuality public to end the harassment but decided otherwise.Yoder, pp. 157‚Äì158. Legacy In Gore Vidal's novel Washington, D.C. (1967), the character of a gay journalist is loosely based on Alsop. Alsop's life was dramatized in David Auburn's play The Columnist, which ran on Broadway from April 25 to July 8, 2012, and focused on the interplay of his politics, his journalism, and his sexuality.

History When the first railroad bridge on the site opened on March 27, 1872, it connected the First Transcontinental Railroad to the eastern United States. The bridge was rebuilt twice, with the current bridge opening on December 20, 1916. When the Union Pacific began heading west from Omaha in 1862 there were no railroads connecting to it from the east. After the Chicago and North Western Railway reached Council Bluffs in 1867, the Union Pacific for a while tried to run freight trains across the frozen river during the winter. The Union Pacific Transfer company maintained a ferry service from 1866 to 1872. The bridge became the property of the UP when it absorbed the C&NW; in 1995. Union Pacific Bridge about 1909 In 1869 the transcontinental railroad was completed. An 1871 report to stockholders has this description: During the 3 years of construction, around 500 men were constantly employed during the construction of the bridge. To place the piers, iron columns were sunk into the water and air pressure was used to displace the water in the column at which point, men entered the column and dug out the sand underneath allow the column to sink until it reached bedrock. Using this process, they were able to sink the columns as much as per day. The deepest the men worked was below the surface of the water during which time they were exposed to air pressure that was 54 pounds per square inch (PSI) greater than atmospheric pressure (14.6 PSI). The columns were then filled with rock and concrete to form a base for the masonry piers above the water line. The new single-track railway bridge was completed in 1872 at a cost of $1.75 million ($ in present day terms). In 1877, a tornado weakened the two easternmost spans, requiring them to be replaced with a wooden trestle. In 1885, to keep pace with the growing demand for railway transportation, construction began on a new bridge. Designed and built under the direction of George S. Morison, it opened in the fall of 1887. It was 1,750 feet long, with four Whipple trusses on stone masonry piers and three deck spans at each end. It was the first double-track railway bridge across the Missouri River. The 1888 bridge also became obsolete. The peak year for American railroad track mileage was 1916. Nearly all interstate commerce went by rail. Six trunk lines of railroad used this bridge, with an average 320 freight and passenger trains crossing every 24 hours. Union Pacific decided to upgrade the Missouri River crossing to handle the traffic and tonnage, and work began in May 1916. To keep this critical artery open, the replacement bridge was constructed on temporary wooden piles immediately upstream of the 1888 stone piers. Another set of piles was driven into the river bed on the downstream side of the piers. When the new bridge was completed the old bridge was rigged with cables and winched from the stone piers to the temporary wood piles. The cables were rerigged to the new structure and it was pulled onto the stone piers. Tracks were connected and traffic resumed with just one hour of interruption. The 1888 bridge was then dismantled. Union Pacific coal train crossing bridge with Loess Hills in background The approaches to the bridge were a mile and a half on each side. The Union Pacific initially committed to including a roadway with the bridge. However, it recanted, and it would not be until 1888 when the Douglas Street Bridge, later called the Ak-Sar-Ben Bridge, was opened as a roadway connecting the cities.

The film series focuses on people affected by a deadly curse that spreads like a virus and manifests itself in various ways, such as turning people homicidal or people being haunted, ultimately leading to their demise, if they come in contact with the curse in any way. All films in the series feature different protagonists, with the first being Karen Davis played by Sarah Michelle Gellar. The protagonist of the second installment and Karen's younger sister Aubrey was played by Amber Tamblyn, while the protagonist of The Grudge 3, Lisa was portrayed by Johanna Braddy. The ghosts The Ghosts are the only characters that appeared in all three of The Grudge films. Kayako Saeki * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity (formerly) / Vengeful Spirit Kayako Saeki portrayed by (Takako Fuji and Aiko Horiuchi) is the primary antagonist of The Grudge series, in life, an ordinary housewife, married to Takeo Saeki and mother of a little boy called Toshio. When she was a child, her mother performed unorthodox exorcisms, and passed her clients' curses to her instead of herself. Kayako and Toshio were later killed in a fit of rage by Takeo after he found her journal and discovered that she had feelings for an American man named Peter. Becoming an Onry≈ç after her death, she now haunts the house, along with that of her husband, son, and her son's pet cat, Mar. A throaty, rattling noise usually comes out of her mouth. Toshio Saeki * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity (formerly) / Vengeful Spirit Toshio Saeki portrayed by (Yuya Ozeki, Ohga Tanaka and Shimba Tsuchiya) was the son of Kayako and Takeo. In life, he enjoyed drawing and owned a cat. After he witnesses the death of his mother at the hands of his father, Takeo drowned Toshio in the bathtub, before killing his son's pet cat. Now Toshio's cursed spirit inhabits the house, along with the spirits of his parents and cat. He usually just haunts people, but there are times in which he has killed. He makes a meowing noise. Takeo Saeki * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity (formerly) / Vengeful Spirit (possibly) Takeo Saeki (portrayed by Takashi Matsuyama) is the husband of Kayako. Takeo finds Kayako's personal diary entries, several of which detail her love obsession with Peter Kirk. As a result, he murders her and Toshio in a fit of jealousy. Kayako hangs him by using her hair like a noose. He too, returns as a ghost but he doesn't have a special ghost form like Kayako and Toshio. He was not physically seen in The Grudge 3 except through archive footage. Mar * Status: Deceased * Faction: Animal (formerly) / Vengeful Spirit Mar is a black cat that belonged to Toshio. Takeo drowned him (stuffed into a microwave oven microwaved to death in Ju-on: The Beginning of The End) along with his son which is why his spirit is linked with Toshio's spirit which is the reason why his meows come out of Toshio's mouth. Mar turns up every now and again, usually to create suspense, and is sometimes seen around Toshio, his appearance is usually to warn people of their impending doom. He has an extended and high-pitched meow, which sometimes comes out of Toshio's mouth. He was not seen in The Grudge 3 except for in archive footage, though his meow still came out of Toshio's mouth. The Grudge The Grudge is the first film in the series and a remake of the Japanese film Ju-on: The Grudge. It follows a similar storyline though with different ending. The film focuses on Karen Davis, and revolves around Karen encountering the curse and trying to end it herself before all people around her die. Karen ends up being the only survivor. Karen Davis Gellar received praise for her performance as Karen in The Grudge. * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity Karen Davis (portrayed by Sarah Michelle Gellar) is the main protagonist in The Grudge. She starts as an American nurse who moves with her boyfriend to Tokyo. After the first nurse, Yoko, does not show up at work, she volunteers to take care of Emma Williams, which causes her to fall victim to the curse. When the curse starts claiming the people around her, she starts investigating the origin of the curse. She decides to head back to the house to keep her boyfriend, Doug, from falling to the grudge, but fails. Karen then tries to stop the curse by burning down the house, but this instead releases the curse. Karen is later placed in a Japanese hospital. She is strapped to a bed and constantly guarded by the police. She is now paranoid, traumatized, and frantic to stop Kayako. She is visited by her sister Aubrey, who was sent by their mother. Later, a hand grabs her arm, causing Karen to panic and she frees herself and successfully evades the Police while being chased by Kayako. When she reaches the roof of the hospital, she backs away to the edge of the roof and Kayako pushes her off, which results in Karen falling to her death. Later by the end of Grudge 2 just as Aubrey went back to Saeki residence to confront Kayako, Aubrey spots Karen calling for Doug and follows her only to spot Takeo instead who kills Aubrey by snapping her neck. Karen is the first one killed in The Grudge 2, and one of two characters other than ghosts to appear in multiple films.http://www.ilikehorrormovies.com/2011/12/grudge-2004.html?m=1http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041021/REVIEWS/40922015/1023 Doug * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity Doug (portrayed by Jason Behr) is Karen's boyfriend who is studying at University of Tokyo, and works at the local bar to make amends.

Alex * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity Alex (portrayed by Ted Raimi) is an employer for Karen. He asked her to replace the missing Yoko. Later on, he entered the cursed house, where he found Emma Williams dead and Karen in a state of shock, and then called the police. Later, when he was coming home after work, he spots a pool of blood on the floor and goes downstairs to investigate. After going down a little bit, he spotted a woman which reveals to be a disfigured Yoko without a lower jaw. As he screams in fear, she kills him, and the detectives later find his dead body along with Yoko's. Nakagawa * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity Nakagawa (portrayed by Ryo Ishibashi) is a detective employed in Tokyo. He and his men are on the case of Yoko being missing from work, and some of the detectives working for him start to disappear as well. During investigation, he and his men discover a detached bottom jaw (later revealed to belong to Yoko), along with the bodies of several people, but a security video from Susan's office building is what convinces him that the history of the Saeki house is connected to the murders. When he enters the house with two tanks of gasoline, he becomes drawn by the sounds of Toshio being drowned, and goes upstairs to investigate. When he enters the bathroom, he finds a boy there, and attempts to save his life; however, while he does this, Takeo appears behind him, and drowns him like he did his son. In The Grudge 2, he is briefly seen in a video Eason is watching. In the video, Eason spots a barely visible Kayako forming in the window of the door behind where the detective is sitting. Igarashi * Status: Unknown * Faction: Humanity Igarashi (portrayed by Hiroshi Matsunaga) is a detective and the assistant of Nakagawa. In the film he visited in the house of Saeki family together with Nakagawa and he help him to investigation.

Matthew Williams * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity Matthew Williams (portrayed by William Mapother) is an American businessman who gets a job in Tokyo, Japan. His wife Jennifer dislikes their life in Japan, because she cannot speak the language and doesn't understand their culture; he assures her that if things don't improve, then they will go back to the United States. One day, when he comes home from work, he finds the house a total mess, and his wife in a weird trance on a bed. He tries to call for help, but is killed by Toshio before he could do anything. He is first possessed by Takeo, and he kicks Susan out of the house before dragging his wife's body up to the attic (at the deleted scene), where Toshio follows him. Later, Detective Nakagawa and his men discover his corpse along with his wife's in the attic. Jennifer Williams * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity Jennifer Williams (portrayed by Clea DuVall) is the wife of Matthew Williams. She is unhappy in Japan because of her misunderstanding of the culture, inability to speak the language, and the fact that she doesn't like Emma. Her husband Matthew assures her that they will go back to the US if things don't improve. While Matthew is at work, she is awoken by the sound of a bowl hitting the floor. After admonishing Emma for making the mess, she sees child's footprints going up the stairs, and follows them up to her (and Toshio's former) bedroom. She is killed by Toshio, who suffocates her on her bed in a vaguely fashion. Matthew then drags her body upstairs, which is discovered alone with his by Detective Nakagawa. Their deaths are ruled as a murder suicide. Emma Williams * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity Emma Williams (portrayed by Grace Zabriskie) is the mother of Matthew and Susan Williams. She is suffering from severe dementia and requires caretakers to watch over her. She is the only one of the Williams aware of the curse being there, but does and says nothing because of her condition. She has a habit of getting up and taking food whenever she pleases, and often leaves a mess behind, one time disturbing Jennifer with some noise she had made. She has only one line in the film before she is killed by the curse - \\"I just want her to leave me alone!\\". Susan Williams Strickland was cast for her success in her previous film Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid. * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity Susan Williams (portrayed by KaDee Strickland) is the sister of Matthew Williams (William Mapother). She is a businesswoman employed in Tokyo. She becomes nervous when she is unable to contact Matthew, and the ghosts of Toshio and Kayako later play around with her, coming to her disturbance. After much running, and one attempt to get help, she resorts to hiding under a duvet. She is killed by Kayako, who drags her under the duvet. She is the last of the Williams' to die, and does not live in the Saeki house. Peter Kirk * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity Peter Kirk (portrayed by Bill Pullman) was a lecturer at one of Tokyo's university and Kayako's infatuation. When he went to the Saeki house, he found out about Kayako's obsession over him, and he finds the family dead. The next day, in front of his wife Maria and in the early morning, he commits suicide by jumping off of his balcony. Whether or not he was possessed by the curse is unknown. Yoko * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity Yoko (portrayed by Y≈çko Maki) is a young Japanese nurse who can speak English and is volunteering at the Care Center; she is Karen's predecessor as Emma Williams's caretaker. One day while she was nursing Emma at the beginning of The Grudge, she spots the pile of garbage on the floor which she follows to the attic door. When she climbs upstairs and uses the lighter she glimpses Kayako who drags her to the attic and kills her. Later, Alex witnesses a woman, stumbling about in the Care Centre. He notices straight away that there is something weird going on and he slips on something to discover the woman is dripping blood. Realizing it is Yoko, he asks her what happened, upon which she turns around to reveal her hideous, jawless face. Alex is later found dead. It is revealed that what actually killed Alex was Kayako, not Yoko's ghost, because Kayako possessed the corpse of Yoko and returned to claim victims in the Centre. This explains why the police only found Yoko's jaw in the Attic, and why Kayako was also not in the Attic at the same time as the police went up there. In a deleted scene, the morticians explain that because Yoko's blood had been covering Alex's corpse, it was only plausible that she killed him, even though this would require her to have survived for 3 days without her jaw. Maria Kirk * Status: Alive * Faction: Humanity Maria Kirk (portrayed by Rosa Blasi) is the wife of Peter Kirk. After waking up one morning, she witnesses her husband's suicide. Maria was later questioned by Karen regarding her husband before his death. She was also unaware of Kayako's love/obsession for Peter but is yet untouched by the curse as she has not entered the house herself. The Grudge 2  Aubrey Davis  The Ring as Katie Embry. * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity (formerly) / Vengeful Spirit (possibly) Aubrey Davis (portrayed by Amber Tamblyn) is Karen's younger sister and the protagonist of The Grudge 2. She lives in Pasadena, California and is one day called to her Mother's house. Mrs. Davis tells Aubrey what has happened to Karen and Doug before announcing to her she will be flying to Tokyo, Japan to bring Karen back. Aubrey is pushed to investigate Karen's death (after Karen is pushed off the roof of the hospital building by Kayako) and at least try to stop Kayako's curse. During her visit to the Saeki House, she mysteriously gets warped into time; to the night of the first murders. There, she is violently killed by Takeo Saeki in exactly the same manner as Kayako was. She turned into a ghost because she died out of extreme sorrow and pain. From that point on, she replaces Kayako until Allison comes face to face with her. Whether she still resides in the house as Kayako's replacement is unknown.  Allison Fleming  Arielle's performance was so positive she was nominated for a teen choice award. * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity Allison Fleming (portrayed by Arielle Kebbel) is a new American schoolgirl from Chicago, Illinois USA who attends Tokyo International School in Tokyo, Japan. Two popular American and Japanese schoolgirls, Vanessa and Miyuki, pretended to be her friends. They take her to the Saeki Family house and lock her in the closet, only to find that the door is stuck when they try to open it. She sees Aubrey's ghost there (which the audience is supposed to think is Kayako), and as a result the curse falls upon her. As the film goes on, she is constantly haunted by the curse, and it begins to take the lives of people around her, including Vanessa and Miyuki. She manages to avoid the curse through her entire stay at Japan, but has almost lost all of her sanity when Jake sees her being helped by her parents in the apartment complex hallway. During her stay in the apartments she is constantly tormented by Kayako, Toshio, Vanessa and Miyuki. She is finally killed by Kayako after a couple of nights at home; the ghost appears in the shadows of her own hood and takes her life right in front of Jake, then preceding to attack him. Allison is the cause of the curse gathering in the apartment complex in the first place. It is quite possible that her parents were cursed by her, and her parents later spread the curse to Jake's parents while they were together at a dinner they were talking about going out to. Allison is the final one killed. She has last replied to Jake before she is killed by the curse - \\"It followed me here. They followed me here.\\" In The Grudge 3, it is revealed that Allison's body was never found.  Vanessa Cassidy  * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity/Vengeful Ghost Vanessa Cassidy (portrayed by Teresa Palmer) is a popular and deceitful American schoolgirl who attends Tokyo International High School with Miyuki. She and Miyuki attempt to snap a picture of Allison frightened at the old house as a prank. When Allison screams in terror (after seeing a ghost), Vanessa scampers out in a cowardly panic, followed closely by Miyuki. At school, she and a group of other girls harass Allison, notably when they heard she had to go and see the school shrink. The curse, however, does not cease to taunt her as it does Miyuki and Allison; she is taken by Kayako after trying to make a call in a phone booth. In the booth, she notices Toshio sitting at her feet and Kayako's hair comes out of the phone and it envelops her, suffocating her to death. Later, she and Miyuki appear as ghosts in Principal Dale's office (the principal herself is a ghost as well) while Allison is there. Vanessa and Miyuki continue to haunt Allison until her death.  Miyuki Nazawa  * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity/Vengeful Ghost Miyuki Nazawa (portrayed by Misako Uno) is a Japanese schoolgirl from Tokyo International High School, and one of Vanessa's best friends. She assists her in playing a mean prank on their classmate Allison Fleming, although she seems to be rather unsure of their visit at the Saeki house. She gets the curse for being in the house, and is the first of the 3 schoolgirls to be killed; while at a love hotel with her boyfriend Michael, Kayako tickles her under the covers, making her think it's Michael just by goofing around, and finally kills her by dragging her into the mirror behind the bed. When Allison is in Principal Dale's office for around the third time, she sees Miyuki, Vanessa, and her principal all returned as ghosts.  Eason  * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity Eason (portrayed by Edison Chen) is a Hong Kong journalist who is researching the paranormal events created from Kayako's curse. He was the one who rescued Karen from the house's fire, and introduces himself to Aubrey when she goes to the hospital. During her stay in Japan, he asks Aubrey questions about the curse, and also supports her as a friend. After a little while, he discovers that the fire that Karen set to the house didn't eliminate the curse, stating instead it worsened something. He was killed by Kayako in his dark room, when Kayako emerged from one of the photos. His corpse is later found by Aubrey, which is then possessed by Kayako and nearly kills her.  Jake Kimble  * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity Jake Kimble (portrayed by Matthew Knight) is a young boy who lives in an apartment in Chicago along with Bill, his father, Lacey, his sister, and Trish, his stepmother, who has just moved in. In The Grudge 2, he discovers strange occurrences in his apartment, and grows more and more disturbed by them as the movie goes on. At the end of the film, he finds the corpses of his father and sister, and witnesses his stepmother be drowned by Toshio. When he finds Allison in the hallway, he asks her what she brought to Chicago with her, and she only replies \\"it followed me here\\" before being killed by Kayako, who then attacks Jake immediately after. In The Grudge 3, Jake is hospitalized in an insane asylum. He has become as paranoid and traumatized as both Karen and Allison after being exposed to the curse for too long. He ends up killed by Kayako at the beginning of the film by being thrown around the room by the invisible Kayako. Then, he is lying in a pool of blood, with almost every bone in his body broken. The curse is reborn in his apartment. Jake was the only one who survived in The Grudge 2 (presumably: there are some characters where it is unstated what happened to them) and the first killed in The Grudge 3 and along with Karen, are the only characters (besides the Saeki ghosts) to appear in more than one film.  Trish Kimble  Successful actress Jennifer Beals in The Grudge 2 * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity Trish Kimble (portrayed by Jennifer Beals) is Jake and Lacey's new step mother and Bill's second wife. She is a kind, tender woman to begin with, but she scares Jake, and seems to have a bad relationship with him. She gradually gets more interesting around when the curse arrives at the apartment complex. The noises in the apartment begin to disturb her, and later she becomes under the influence of Kayako, which prompts her to kill her husband with hot oil and a frying pan. Later, Jake finds her in a bathtub with a blank look, revealing the curse's presence upon her to him. She is killed by Toshio, who drowns her in the bathtub, only seconds after she says to her step son \\"it's time for your bath, Jake.\\" In The Grudge 3, it is revealed that Trish became the primary suspect of the deaths in murder-suicide act.  Bill Kimble  * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity Bill Kimble (portrayed by Christopher Cousins) is Jake's father. He is a kind, loving family man, but later becomes influenced by Takeo. This begins to show more when he starts to act strangely and not like himself; his influence by the spirit is indicated when he overhears Trish talking on the phone with a man named Nate, and begins to squeeze his keys in his fist to the point where he makes his hand bleed. From that point on, he thinks his wife is having an affair, and scolds her about it the following morning, while she is making him breakfast. When he yells at her for burning his bacon, she (being under Kayako's influence) kills him by having hot oil from a frying pan poured onto his head, and then smacking him with the same pan. Jake later finds his corpse in his parents' bedroom.  Lacey Kimble  * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity Lacey Kimble (portrayed by Sarah Roemer) is a young cheerleader and Jake's older sister. She cares a lot about her brother, and spends a night with him when he is awakened and frightened by the banging next door. Jake looks up to her, appearing to see her as the only one who understands what he is dealing with, but is unaware and unaffected by the curse until the very end. Jake later finds her dead with her head hanging in water in a bathtub, indicating that the curse had murdered her by drowning her. In The Grudge 3, it is revealed that Lacey was murdered by Trish. Nakagawa Kawamata * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity Nakagawa Kawamata (portrayed by Kim Miyori) is an Itako, Kayako and Naoko's mother, Toshio's maternal grandmother and Takeo and Daisuke's mother-in-law. she used her daughter to \\"eat\\" the evil spirits she drove from her patients, marking Kayako for the rest of her life. In the film, she explains to Aubrey Davis that it is not her fault the curse was created, rather because her daughter was foolish and was killed out of Takeo's rage, and that there is no way to stop it. She is then killed by Kayako's vengeful spirit, although it looked as if she died of a heart attack.  Mrs. Davis  * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity Mrs. Davis (portrayed by Joanna Cassidy) is the mother of Karen and Aubrey. She is extremely sick, coughing repeatedly, and never once in the film is seen out of bed. Since she obviously cannot go to Japan to search for Karen herself, she sends Aubrey to do the job for her. Mrs. Davis sees Karen as a far superior human being than Aubrey, and often makes rude comments to Aubrey, even during their final conversation together (before Aubrey's death) over the phone. Aubrey tells her that she loves her but cannot treat her that way anymore before her death in the Saeki house. She is one of only a few characters to never encounter the curse, but it is undecided if her illness killed her in the near future. Also, it is unknown if she knows about Aubrey's death. In the alternate ending (unrated version) the curse travels all the way to Pasadena to claim her, so it is unknown if she died of her sickness or Kayako. This would mean that the curse would also be spreading throughout California as well as Chicago.  Sally  * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity Sally (portrayed by Jenna Dewan) is Lacey's best friend who resides in one of the next door apartments. She is first seen as a friendly, helpful girl, but is later obviously influenced by the curse. Later in the movie, Lacey goes to her apartment to show her how she looks in her cheer leading outfit, only to find her drinking milk from a gallon, and then regurgitating it back into the gallon, with a ghostly look on her face. She is later killed in the same way Jennifer Williams was in the first Grudge film. It is unknown how she encountered the curse. Mrs. Dale * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity/Vengeful Ghost Mrs. Dale (portrayed by Eve Gordon) is the calm but ghostly principal of Tokyo International High School. Allison is called to her office a couple of times in the film, and she is reluctant to tell her what is wrong, saying that she wants to go home. The principal tells Allison that what is haunting her isn't real; she claimed to have been in the Saeki house with police, and that there's nothing there, saying that it's just an old, abandoned house. However, this quickly proves to be false, when two ghosts of Vanessa and Miyuki appear next to her, and she becomes a ghost herself, indicating that the curse had already killed her along with the others. Sotaro * Status: Alive * Faction: Humanity Sotaro (portrayed by Sotaro Nagasawa) is the teacher of Japanese in Tokyo International High School. During his lesson Allison and Miyuki persecuted by the ghosts of Toshio and Mar. But he never encountered the curse himself.  Michael  * Status: Unknown * Faction: Humanity Michael (portrayed by Shaun Sipos) is Miyuki's caring but rather lustful boyfriend. On the night of Miyuki's death, he brings her to a love hotel. Miyuki finds a condom on the bed while he is showering, indicating that he was clearly planning on having sex with her that night. He is still showering while the curse kills Miyuki, and claims that she just disappeared when he got out. It is unknown if he got the curse from her and it later killed him.  John and Annie Fleming  * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity John and Annie Fleming (portrayed by Gwen Lorenzetti and Paul Jarrett) are the parents of Allison. When Bill and his family first move in, they are very friendly and welcoming towards them, and suggest that they get together for dinner sometime. Later in the film, Jake spots them helping Allison to their apartment; when he says hi to Mr. Fleming, he simply turns around, gives a momentary glance, and keeps walking. Jake later tells Lacey that they were acting \\"really weird.\\" They do not appear again in the film, and it is unknown if the curse kills them like it did Allison. It is quite possible that the Fleming parents and the Kimble parents did indeed go out for dinner, and the Flemings had gotten the curse from Allison then spread it to the Kimbles. In the alternate ending, we discovered the Fleming's house is now-silent, indicating that Mr. and Mrs. Fleming, are dead. In The Grudge 3, it is revealed that John and Annie were killed by Trish.  Mishima  * Status: Alive * Faction: Humanity Mishima (portrayed by Zen Kajihara) is a friend of Eason who has a very large interest for folklore. Eason goes to him when he and Aubrey have questions about the curse and Kayako's past history, and he provides them with some information. He himself never went into the house, nor does he have any lines, so it is assumed that he never encountered the curse himself. The Grudge 3 Lisa Lisa and her asthmatic sister Rose * Status: Alive * Faction: Humanity Lisa (portrayed by Johanna Braddy) is the main protagonist of The Grudge 3 who lives in the same building as Jake did. She is the sister of Max and Rose. She appeared to be living in the apartment for some time, knowing most of the residents such as Jake and Allison Flemming (rarely meeting the latter). At the time of the events of The Grudge 3, she had been intending to leave Chicago for New York with her boyfriend to work as a fashion model so she can win the scholarship money to pay for Rose's medical bills. She becomes rather uncomfortable with the fact that Rose saying that a new boy had moved into the building despite not hearing any of it before. She later finds out the 'new boy' is in fact Toshio after running into him at the floor Jake's apartment is. Lisa is one of the two survivors of the apartment though she does not know that Rose's body also houses Kayako's spirit. Rose  * Status: Alive * Faction: Humanity Rose (portrayed by Jadie Rose Hobson) is an 8-year-old girl who suffers from asthma attacks. She is Lisa and Max's little sister. At the end, Rose asks Lisa if they will be safe and Lisa assures her that they will be, embracing her. As the camera moves, we discover that Lisa is now hugging Kayako, her curse now contained in Rose's body. Rose was the only one to stop the curse throughout the films. She is still alive, even if Kayako is shown instead of her. It is implied that when she gets older Kayako will take over her body to get her own body back. Dr. Sullivan Despite the film's mixed to negative reception Smith's performance was praised. * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity Dr. Sullivan (portrayed by Shawnee Smith) is Jake's case worker. Since the day Jake was put in mental care, Dr. Sullivan attempted to ease him, believing that Jake's stories of Kayako killing his family was merely him hallucinating his stepmother Trish killing them instead (this was due to the police suspecting Trish to be the murderer at the most). Her assumptions come wrong when she is urgently called to Jake's room by a security guard, only to see Jake dead along with every bone in his body broken in a bloody mess. Sullivan later investigates Jake's apartment and is the one who tells Lisa about Jake's horrible and abnormal death. She also informs Lisa that the 'new boy' Lisa saw in her apartment is in fact dead after revealing a photo of Toshio in a newspaper, revealing Toshio died years ago. Sullivan later sees unusual visions in the surveillance cameras viewing the hallways of the facility and investigates, only to be chased by Kayako once getting there. She attempts to escape but is killed when the final door she attempts to open does not respond despite yelling out to the cleaner just outside for help. Lisa calls for Sullivan after she is kicked out of her apartment, but learns that she had been killed. Naoko Kawamata * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity (formerly) / Vengeful Spirit (currently) Naoko (portrayed by Emi Ikehata) is Kayako's younger sister. For Naoko, growing up in their mother's care was \\"frightening\\", but for Kayako it was a living nightmare. She knows of the curse and how to end it once and for all. Killed in rage by a possessed Max (in a fashion similar to her sister's death), she is resurrected as a new Onry≈ç. With Kayako's curse now contained inside Rose's body, Naoko's curse has taken its place and now haunts the Chicago apartments. Daisuke * Status: Alive * Faction: Humanity Daisuke (portrayed by Takatsuna Mukai) is the widowed husband of Naoko, he appeared briefly trying to convince Naoko to stay in Tokyo fearing for her safety because she was attempting to stop the curse, in the end he finally agrees to let her move to Chicago. He never encountered the curse himself nor did he visit the Saeki house, it is unknown if he is aware of Naoko's death. Max * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity Max (portrayed by Gil McKinney) is the landlord of the Chicago building. It appears Max was the landlord of the apartment for some time and while it is presumed he did fairly well in his job before the chaos Kayako, Takeo and Toshio began causing at around the events between the second and the third films. The spirits caused many people in the apartment to either die, go missing or simply move, bringing Max into hard times, not to mention that the flow of new residents was at an all-time low. Max is revealed to be on the brink of being fired and does what he can to keep the building together. He introduces Naoko to the building (having no idea what she came for) and his sisters though does not tell her why the apartment itself seems rather empty of residents. Throughout the film, it becomes clear Max is possessed by Takeo; showing signs of extreme anger, resentfulness and other signs of odd behavior, frightening Rose and Lisa. His possession also leads to getting fired after he pushed his boss to a pile of bricks. Max, being possessed, also interrupts the ceremony Naoko attempts to get rid of Takeo, Toshio and Kayako's spirits. He unknowingly kills Naoko in the similar way Takeo killed Kayako and after Takeo's spirit is finally banished, he breaks down in tears after seeing that he was responsible for Naoko's death. He is shortly attacked by Naoko, who has taken the form of a ghost, similar to that of her sister Kayako. Max is the true final one killed. Andy * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity Andy (portrayed by Beau Mirchoff) is Lisa's boyfriend. He was very unaware of the curse in the apartments and seems to not care about the deaths and disappearances that much. He and Lisa were going to go to New York, but a worried Lisa had to take care of her family so, they stayed. Right after he reassures Lisa everything will be alright, he walks back to his apartment, only to find Toshio's running legs up the stairs. He follows them, and goes into the room. He is then killed by Kayako's ghost. His body is later found by Lisa and Rose which is then possessed by Kayako to kill Lisa. Gretchen Marina Sirtis's first horror film appearance * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity Gretchen (portrayed by Marina Sirtis) is a neighbor of Lisa, Rose, and Max, and a painter. She is often hired as a guardian to Rose when Max or Lisa are busy. Gretchen appears to be friends with Max, and is killed by Kayako in her apartment when she was painting a picture of Rose, when Kayako came out of one of her paintings, crawled to Gretchen, and gouged her eyes out, then ripped off her jaw. Her body was later found by Max and taken away by paramedics. Gretchen's death triggers Max's possession. Brenda * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity Brenda (portrayed by Mihaela Nankova) and her mother move out of the Chicago building after Brenda starts seeing the ghosts of Kayako and Toshio. She might have had extra-sensory perception or a feeling of impending doom as evidenced by her reluctance to speak. It's likely that she has Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, resulting from her encounters with the ghosts, leaving her mute. She also seems to have lost her appetite, barely touching her mother's Chinese food dinner. She is killed by being dragged into her bathtub, and drowned by Takeo's evil spirit while her mother was unpacking. Her mother returned upon hearing a struggle she returned to find Brenda had vanished. It is unknown if Brenda's mother is also killed by the curse. Renee * Status: Unknown * Faction: Humanity Renee (portrayed by Laura Giosh) is the mother of the silent Brenda and one of the few tenants left in the apartment. Because the Kimble family deaths frightened Brenda and because Brenda continuously saw Kayako and Toshio she finally decided to move out of the apartments. She had no ill feelings towards Max, as they were on good terms with her moving out. Renee tries to get Brenda to talk over a Chinese food dinner but she remains unresponsive. She prepares Brenda a bath to help her relax, and while unpacking at her new home she hears a struggle in the bathroom and discovers Brenda has vanished. It is unknown what became of her, but because she had lived in the cursed apartment, it's highly likely that she was later killed. Ben * Status: Alive * Faction: Humanity Ben (portrayed by Mike Straub) is a security guard and the assistant of Dr. Sullivan. After he sees Kayako kill Jake through the camera, he calls to Dr. Sullivan and both are shocked to see Jake's mangled corpse. Later when Kayako is chasing Dr. Sullivan, Dr. Sullivan begs him to open the door to save her, but he's busy at cleaning the floor and therefore he did not hear her. Mr. Praski * Status: Deceased * Faction: Humanity Mr. Praski (portrayed by Michael McCoy) is Max's boss. He was for giving the apartment to a company because of the deaths, disappearances, the leaving tenants, and the loss of money, but he settled to give Max one last chance. After Gretchen's death he views Max as unfit to be landlord and fires him. A possessed Max shows his rage to him, and pushes him into a pile of bricks. Shortly after the incident, Toshio kills him in his car.

Jean-Marie was descended from the great chief Kwah, while Agathe had been raised in Williams Lake by the Sisters of the Child Jesus.

Devastated, she opted not to return home for the summers, but to stay on at the school instead. After graduation, she stayed on at the school, completing chores such as mending, cleaning, embroidering and sewing. At some point, Prince contracted tuberculosis, and by the age of 34 she was confined to bed. On August 19, 1949, she was admitted to the hospital and died the same day.

He is mostly known for his distinguished service in World War I; as a torpedo boat commander having sunk no fewer than two Austro- Hungarian battleships (SMS Wien in 1917 and SMS Szent Istv√°n in 1918). Biography He was born in Milazzo on October 8,1887 in a family with a strong tradition of Merchant Marine Captains. After receiving his training at the Naval Academy in Livorno, on March 17, 1912 Rizzo was appointed a ship-of- the-line sub-lieutenant of the Italian Navy. He saw action in the First World War (1915‚Äì1918) when he conducted several spectacular raids as commander of torpedo boats (PT boat MAS) against ships of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. In December 1917, Rizzo sank the Austro-Hungarian pre-dreadnought battleship SMS Wien while she was at anchor inside the defences of Trieste harbour. On 10 February 1918, three MAS boats (with the MAS 96 commanded by Rizzo) attacked Austrian shipping inside the harbour of Bakar (now in Croatia), a port in an enclosed bay near Fiume at the head of the Kvarner Gulf. As it lay 80 km in a sheltered waterway, it was thought to be beyond attack, so the raid was intended as a psychological assault as well as a physical one. It became widely known as the Bakar mockery (Italian: Beffa di Buccari). On 10 June 1918 Rizzo sank the large battleship SMS Szent Istv√°n off Premuda. The sinking of the 21,700-ton ship, the greatest success of any MAS torpedo boat, is considered an important part of Italian naval historyPhotos and comments of the \\"Santo Stefano\\" sinking (in Italian) and is celebrated by the Italian Navy on 10 June every year. In 1919 Rizzo took part in the seizure of the city of Fiume (now Rijeka in Croatia) led by Gabriele d'Annunzio. He retired from active service in 1920 with the rank of commander. He received the Gold Medal of Military Valor (twice), the Silver Medal (four times), the Cross of War, and was a knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy. France awarded Rizzo the Croix de guerre and made him a knight of the L√©gion d'honneur; the United Kingdom honoured him with its Distinguished Service Order; and the President of the United States awarded him the Navy Distinguished Service Medal.Luigi Rizzo award from the USA Admiral Mikl√≥s Horthy, Commander-in-Chief of the Austro-Hungarian Fleet in WWI and leader of the Otranto Raid which saw the sinking of SMS Szent Istv√°n, as Regent of the Kingdom of Hungary awarded Rizzo the Royal Hungarian Order of Saint Stephen. In his later life, Rizzo worked in shipping businesses and shipyards, and volunteered during the Second Italo- Abyssinian War. He eventually rose to the rank of Divisional Admiral and was ennobled by King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, taking the victory title of Conte di Grado e di Premuda. In September 1943, after he ordered the sinking of sevearal ships to prevent them from being commandeered by the Nazis,http://www.marina.difesa.it/storiacultura/storia/medaglie/Pagine/RizzoLuigi.aspx Rizzo was charged with sabotage and deported to Austria initially to the Klagenfurt military prison and later to the confinement residence in Hirschegg where he was reached by his daughter Maria Guglielmina, After the end of the war they returned to Italy. Admiral Luigi Rizzo died in Rome on June 27, 1951 after a long illness. Notes Bibliography * Kennedy, Paul.

She was a student for many years at Interlochen Arts Academy and the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in England. Though her background lies in musical theater and traditional opera, she is the creator of The Zen of Screaming Instructional DVD, a DVD that teaches the art of singing referred to as 'screaming'. The DVDs are distributed world wide by Alfred Music and also at the website http://www.melissacross.com. Over 50,000 copies have been sold to date. Although Cross has instructed all genres for over 20 years, she is best known for her training with extreme phonation and working with vocalists including Randy Blythe, Oliver Sykes, Matthew Tuck, David Draiman and Corey Taylor. She has garnered national media attention as an expert in helping vocalists minimize and avoid damage to their vocal cords. She has appeared on numerous late night network television shows, NPR, MTV, VH1, the Discovery and Smithsonian Channel. She is internationally featured in several countries where seminars were conducted. At the 2009 Voice Foundation Annual Symposium she presented to classical voice teachers and international voice physicians and therapists her method to enable awareness of contemporary stylings. She continues to present workshops there annually as well as seminars for teachers and artists. Melissa Cross' first DVD was called The Zen of Screaming: Vocal Instruction for a New Breed. Her second DVD was titled The Zen of Screaming 2 and expanded on the instruction found in the first DVD. A new DVD called ZOS3 - See the Sound, which incorporates a brand new method of teaching vocal use of all types and genres through the use of visual imaging was scheduled for release in Summer 2012. Cross was also a judge for the 7th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists. In 2011, Machine Head frontman Robert Flynn studied with Melissa Cross in preparation for the upcoming album Unto The Locust. Flynn said it was an intense session of unlearning seventeen years of bad habits.http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/news/VideoMachine-Heads- Robb-Flynn-Interviewed-By-Artisan-News-Service-23257.aspx References External links *Official site Category:American female singers Category:Living people Category:American vocal coaches Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Melissa Cross"},{"id":"7200796","text":"Jerametrius Tarell Butler (born November 28, 1978) is a former American football cornerback in the National Football League.

It is a remake of the 1972 French film Chloe in the Afternoon by √âric Rohmer.\\"In brief: Chris Rock to direct Rohmer remake\\". The Guardian. May 15, 2006. Plot Richard Cooper (Chris Rock) is a very happily married and professionally successful man. He is perfectly content with his home life in suburban New York with his lovely wife Brenda (Gina Torres), a teacher, and his two young children. There is one problem in his marriage: their sex life has stagnated, leaving Richard frustrated and sex-starved. At one point, Brenda accuses Richard of being on the down-low. During those dull days at the office, he occasionally fantasizes about other women, but never acts upon his impulses. An encounter with an attractive old friend, Nikki (Kerry Washington), suddenly casts doubt over his typically resilient self-control. At first she claims to just want to be his friend, but she begins to show up consistently at his Manhattan financial office just to talk or have lunch, which causes his boss, secretaries, and peers to view him with varying degrees of contempt. When Nikki begins to deliberately seduce Richard, he does not know what to do. Against his better judgment, he flies with her out of town for one day on an errand, where he is beaten by her boyfriend. Then he returns too late to make a sales presentation at an important business meeting, causing the loss of a lucrative contract. Later, when she and her fianc√© are about to move to Los Angeles, Nikki asks Richard to come to her apartment later to say a \\"proper goodbye\\". When he gets to Nikki's apartment, he finds her in her underwear in her bathroom. In the moments before it seems Richard will consummate his attraction to Nikki, he realizes how grave the loss of his wife and children would be, so he walks out on Nikki. Richard returns home, surprising his wife, and, for the first time in the film, they begin to rebuild a genuine rapport, with a possible promise of good things to come.

It also hosted boxing matches and was open for public skating. Built in 1904 in Laurium, Michigan, the Palestra was the first building in the world built specifically for the use of ice hockey, and for most of its existence, the Palestra had a natural ice surface. The rink was flooded and would then freeze in the cold weather. The arena did not have ice making equipment until the late 1940s. The building opened on December 16, 1904, with a professional game between Portage Lake and Calumet. Calumet won 4‚Äì3 in front of 3,000 spectators.

The silicon is usually patterned with sub- micrometre precision, into microphotonic components. These operate in the infrared, most commonly at the 1.55 micrometre wavelength used by most fiber optic telecommunication systems. The silicon typically lies on top of a layer of silica in what (by analogy with a similar construction in microelectronics) is known as silicon on insulator (SOI). Silicon photonics 300 mm wafer Silicon photonic devices can be made using existing semiconductor fabrication techniques, and because silicon is already used as the substrate for most integrated circuits, it is possible to create hybrid devices in which the optical and electronic components are integrated onto a single microchip. Consequently, silicon photonics is being actively researched by many electronics manufacturers including IBM and Intel, as well as by academic research groups, as a means for keeping on track with Moore's Law, by using optical interconnects to provide faster data transfer both between and within microchips. The propagation of light through silicon devices is governed by a range of nonlinear optical phenomena including the Kerr effect, the Raman effect, two-photon absorption and interactions between photons and free charge carriers. The presence of nonlinearity is of fundamental importance, as it enables light to interact with light, thus permitting applications such as wavelength conversion and all-optical signal routing, in addition to the passive transmission of light. Silicon waveguides are also of great academic interest, due to their unique guiding properties, they can be used for communications, interconnects, biosensors, and they offer the possibility to support exotic nonlinear optical phenomena such as soliton propagation.  Applications   Optical communications  In a typical optical link, data is first transferred from the electrical to the optical domain using an electro-optic modulator or a directly-modulated laser. An electro-optic modulator can vary the intensity and/or the phase of the optical carrier. In silicon photonics, a common technique to achieve modulation is to vary the density of free charge carriers. Variations of electron and hole densities change the real and the imaginary part of the refractive index of silicon as described by the empirical equations of Soref and Bennett. Modulators can consist of both forward-biased PIN diodes, which generally generate large phase-shifts but suffer of lower speeds, as well as of reverse-biased PN junctions. A prototype optical interconnect with microring modulators integrated with germanium detectors has been demonstrated. Non-resonant modulators, such as Mach-Zehnder interferometers, have typical dimensions in the millimeter range and are usually used in telecom or datacom applications. Resonant devices, such as ring-resonators, can have dimensions of few tens of micrometers only, occupying therefore much smaller areas. In 2013, researchers demonstrated a resonant depletion modulator that can be fabricated using standard Silicon-on-Insulator Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (SOI CMOS) manufacturing processes. A similar device has been demonstrated as well in bulk CMOS rather than in SOI. On the receiver side, the optical signal is typically converted back to the electrical domain using a semiconductor photodetector. The semiconductor used for carrier generation has usually a band-gap smaller than the photon energy, and the most common choice is pure germanium. Most detectors utilize a PN junction for carrier extraction, however, detectors based on metal-semiconductor junctions (with germanium as the semiconductor) have been integrated into silicon waveguides as well. More recently, silicon-germanium avalanche photodiodes capable of operating at 40 Gbit/s have been fabricated. Complete transceivers have been commercialized in the form of active optical cables. Optical communications are conveniently classified by the reach, or length, of their links. The majority of silicon photonic communications have so far been limited to telecom and datacom applications, where the reach is of several kilometers or several meters respectively. Silicon photonics, however, is expected to play a significant role in computercom as well, where optical links have a reach in the centimeter to meter range. In fact, progress in computer technology (and the continuation of Moore's Law) is becoming increasingly dependent on faster data transfer between and within microchips. Optical interconnects may provide a way forward, and silicon photonics may prove particularly useful, once integrated on the standard silicon chips. In 2006 Former Intel senior vice president Pat Gelsinger stated that, \\"Today, optics is a niche technology. Tomorrow, it's the mainstream of every chip that we build.\\" The first microprocessor with optical input/output (I/O) was demonstrated in December 2015 using an approach known as \\"zero-change\\" CMOS photonics. This first demonstration was based on a 45 nm SOI node, and the bi-directional chip-to- chip link was operated at a rate of 2√ó2.5 Gbit/s. The total energy consumption of the link was calculated to be of 16 pJ/b and was dominated by the contribution of the off-chip laser. Some researchers believe an on-chip laser source is required. Others think that it should remain off-chip because of thermal problems (the quantum efficiency decreases with temperature, and computer chips are generally hot) and because of CMOS-compatibility issues. One such device is the hybrid silicon laser, in which the silicon is bonded to a different semiconductor (such as indium phosphide) as the lasing medium. Other devices include all-silicon Raman laser or an all-silicon Brillouin lasers wherein silicon serves as the lasing medium. In 2012, IBM announced that it had achieved optical components at the 90 nanometer scale that can be manufactured using standard techniques and incorporated into conventional chips. In September 2013, Intel announced technology to transmit data at speeds of 100 gigabits per second along a cable approximately five millimeters in diameter for connecting servers inside data centers. Conventional PCI-E data cables carry data at up to eight gigabits per second, while networking cables reach 40 Gbit/s. The latest version of the USB standard tops out at ten Gbit/s. The technology does not directly replace existing cables in that it requires a separate circuit board to interconvert electrical and optical signals. Its advanced speed offers the potential of reducing the number of cables that connect blades on a rack and even of separating processor, storage and memory into separate blades to allow more efficient cooling and dynamic configuration. Graphene photodetectors have the potential to surpass germanium devices in several important aspects, although they remain about one order of magnitude behind current generation capacity, despite rapid improvement. Graphene devices can work at very high frequencies, and could in principle reach higher bandwidths. Graphene can absorb a broader range of wavelengths than germanium. That property could be exploited to transmit more data streams simultaneously in the same beam of light. Unlike germanium detectors, graphene photodetectors do not require applied voltage, which could reduce energy needs. Finally, graphene detectors in principle permit a simpler and less expensive on-chip integration. However, graphene does not strongly absorb light. Pairing a silicon waveguide with a graphene sheet better routes light and maximizes interaction. The first such device was demonstrated in 2011. Manufacturing such devices using conventional manufacturing techniques has not been demonstrated.Orcutt, Mike (2 October 2013) \\"Graphene-Based Optical Communication Could Make Computing More Efficient. MIT Technology Review.  Optical routers and signal processors  Another application of silicon photonics is in signal routers for optical communication. Construction can be greatly simplified by fabricating the optical and electronic parts on the same chip, rather than having them spread across multiple components. A wider aim is all-optical signal processing, whereby tasks which are conventionally performed by manipulating signals in electronic form are done directly in optical form. An important example is all-optical switching, whereby the routing of optical signals is directly controlled by other optical signals. Another example is all-optical wavelength conversion. In 2013, a startup company named \\"Compass-EOS\\", based in California and in Israel, was the first to present a commercial silicon-to-photonics router.  Long range telecommunications using silicon photonics  Silicon microphotonics can potentially increase the Internet's bandwidth capacity by providing micro- scale, ultra low power devices. Furthermore, the power consumption of datacenters may be significantly reduced if this is successfully achieved. Researchers at Sandia, Kotura, NTT, Fujitsu and various academic institutes have been attempting to prove this functionality. A 2010 paper reported on a prototype 80 km, 12.5 Gbit/s transmission using microring silicon devices.  Light-field displays  As of 2015, US startup company Magic Leap is working on a light-field chip using silicon photonics for the purpose of an augmented reality display.  Physical properties   Optical guiding and dispersion tailoring  Silicon is transparent to infrared light with wavelengths above about 1.1 micrometres. Silicon also has a very high refractive index, of about 3.5. The tight optical confinement provided by this high index allows for microscopic optical waveguides, which may have cross-sectional dimensions of only a few hundred nanometers. Single mode propagation can be achieved, thus (like single-mode optical fiber) eliminating the problem of modal dispersion. The strong dielectric boundary effects that result from this tight confinement substantially alter the optical dispersion relation. By selecting the waveguide geometry, it is possible to tailor the dispersion to have desired properties, which is of crucial importance to applications requiring ultrashort pulses. In particular, the group velocity dispersion (that is, the extent to which group velocity varies with wavelength) can be closely controlled. In bulk silicon at 1.55 micrometres, the group velocity dispersion (GVD) is normal in that pulses with longer wavelengths travel with higher group velocity than those with shorter wavelength. By selecting a suitable waveguide geometry, however, it is possible to reverse this, and achieve anomalous GVD, in which pulses with shorter wavelengths travel faster. Anomalous dispersion is significant, as it is a prerequisite for soliton propagation, and modulational instability. In order for the silicon photonic components to remain optically independent from the bulk silicon of the wafer on which they are fabricated, it is necessary to have a layer of intervening material. This is usually silica, which has a much lower refractive index (of about 1.44 in the wavelength region of interest), and thus light at the silicon-silica interface will (like light at the silicon-air interface) undergo total internal reflection, and remain in the silicon. This construct is known as silicon on insulator. It is named after the technology of silicon on insulator in electronics, whereby components are built upon a layer of insulator in order to reduce parasitic capacitance and so improve performance.  Kerr nonlinearity  Silicon has a focusing Kerr nonlinearity, in that the refractive index increases with optical intensity. This effect is not especially strong in bulk silicon, but it can be greatly enhanced by using a silicon waveguide to concentrate light into a very small cross-sectional area. This allows nonlinear optical effects to be seen at low powers. The nonlinearity can be enhanced further by using a slot waveguide, in which the high refractive index of the silicon is used to confine light into a central region filled with a strongly nonlinear polymer. Kerr nonlinearity underlies a wide variety of optical phenomena. One example is four wave mixing, which has been applied in silicon to realise optical parametric amplification, parametric wavelength conversion, and frequency comb generation., Kerr nonlinearity can also cause modulational instability, in which it reinforces deviations from an optical waveform, leading to the generation of spectral- sidebands and the eventual breakup of the waveform into a train of pulses. Another example (as described below) is soliton propagation.  Two-photon absorption  Silicon exhibits two-photon absorption (TPA), in which a pair of photons can act to excite an electron-hole pair. This process is related to the Kerr effect, and by analogy with complex refractive index, can be thought of as the imaginary-part of a complex Kerr nonlinearity. At the 1.55 micrometre telecommunication wavelength, this imaginary part is approximately 10% of the real part. The influence of TPA is highly disruptive, as it both wastes light, and generates unwanted heat. It can be mitigated, however, either by switching to longer wavelengths (at which the TPA to Kerr ratio drops), or by using slot waveguides (in which the internal nonlinear material has a lower TPA to Kerr ratio). Alternatively, the energy lost through TPA can be partially recovered (as is described below) by extracting it from the generated charge carriers.  Free charge carrier interactions  The free charge carriers within silicon can both absorb photons and change its refractive index. This is particularly significant at high intensities and for long durations, due to the carrier concentration being built up by TPA. The influence of free charge carriers is often (but not always) unwanted, and various means have been proposed to remove them. One such scheme is to implant the silicon with helium in order to enhance carrier recombination. A suitable choice of geometry can also be used to reduce the carrier lifetime. Rib waveguides (in which the waveguides consist of thicker regions in a wider layer of silicon) enhance both the carrier recombination at the silica-silicon interface and the diffusion of carriers from the waveguide core. A more advanced scheme for carrier removal is to integrate the waveguide into the intrinsic region of a PIN diode, which is reverse biased so that the carriers are attracted away from the waveguide core. A more sophisticated scheme still, is to use the diode as part of a circuit in which voltage and current are out of phase, thus allowing power to be extracted from the waveguide. The source of this power is the light lost to two photon absorption, and so by recovering some of it, the net loss (and the rate at which heat is generated) can be reduced. As is mentioned above, free charge carrier effects can also be used constructively, in order to modulate the light.  Second-order nonlinearity  Second-order nonlinearities cannot exist in bulk silicon because of the centrosymmetry of its crystalline structure. By applying strain however, the inversion symmetry of silicon can be broken. This can be obtained for example by depositing a silicon nitride layer on a thin silicon film. Second-order nonlinear phenomena can be exploited for optical modulation, spontaneous parametric down-conversion, parametric amplification, ultra-fast optical signal processing and mid-infrared generation. Efficient nonlinear conversion however requires phase matching between the optical waves involved. Second- order nonlinear waveguides based on strained silicon can achieve phase matching by dispersion-engineering. So far, however, experimental demonstrations are based only on designs which are not phase matched. It has been shown that phase matching can be obtained as well in silicon double slot waveguides coated with a highly nonlinear organic cladding and in periodically strained silicon waveguides.  The Raman effect  Silicon exhibits the Raman effect, in which a photon is exchanged for a photon with a slightly different energy, corresponding to an excitation or a relaxation of the material. Silicon's Raman transition is dominated by a single, very narrow frequency peak, which is problematic for broadband phenomena such as Raman amplification, but is beneficial for narrowband devices such as Raman lasers. Early studies of Raman amplification and Raman lasers started at UCLA which led to demonstration of net gain Silicon Raman amplifiers and silicon pulsed Raman laser with fiber resonator (Optics express 2004). Consequently, all- silicon Raman lasers have been fabricated in 2005.  The Brillouin effect  In the Raman effect, photons are red- or blue-shifted by optical phonons with a frequency of about 15 THz. However, silicon waveguides also support acoustic phonon excitations. The interaction of these acoustic phonons with light is called Brillouin scattering. The frequencies and mode shapes of these acoustic phonons are dependent on the geometry and size of the silicon waveguides, making it possible to produce strong Brillouin scattering at frequencies ranging from a few MHz to tens of GHz. Stimulated Brillouin scattering has been used to make narrowband optical amplifiers as well as all- silicon Brillouin lasers. The interaction between photons and acoustic phonons is also studied in the field of cavity optomechanics, although 3D optical cavities are not necessary to observe the interaction. For instance, besides in silicon waveguides the optomechanical coupling has also been demonstrated in fibers and in chalcogenide waveguides.  Solitons  The evolution of light through silicon waveguides can be approximated with a cubic Nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation, which is notable for admitting sech-like soliton solutions. These optical solitons (which are also known in optical fiber) result from a balance between self phase modulation (which causes the leading edge of the pulse to be redshifted and the trailing edge blueshifted) and anomalous group velocity dispersion. Such solitons have been observed in silicon waveguides, by groups at the universities of Columbia, Rochester, and Bath.

It lies southeast of the mainland city of Gustavus and southwest of the mainland community of Excursion Inlet. Pleasant Island has a land area of 49.192 km¬≤ (18.993 sq mi), had no population at the 2000 census, and is reported to be uninhabited as of 2012. Location: The Pleasant/Lemesurier/Inian Islands Wilderness is located in Icy Strait between Chichagof Island and the mainland on the north end of the Tongass National Forest. The Wilderness is made up of three large islands and a few small islands adjacent to them. Access: The wilderness is accessible by boat, kayak or float plane. Area Description: This grouping of relatively small islands is unique in that the three largest islands are very different in topography, use and character. Pleasant Island is fairly flat and has a mixture of old-growth forest and muskeg. The island has a couple of small lakes that can be hiked to from the shoreline. The island has many beaches friendly to small boats or kayaks and several areas that are used for camping. Pleasant Island is located just a couple of miles from Gustavus, Alaska, and Glacier Bay National Park. Many people kayaking to and from the park stop at Pleasant Island for lunch or a campover. Lemesurier Island, to the west of Pleasant, appears different because it rises out of Icy Strait to above sea level. The top of the island is not forested like the rest, but is in the sub- alpine. There is one small lake on the south side of the island which can be hiked to from shoreline. There are half a dozen nice beaches around the south and north sides of the island where small boats or kayaks can approach and these coves are also good for camping. There are two small private parcels of land on the south side of this island. The lnian Islands are even further west and are nearest the Pacific Ocean. They receive the high energy seas on the west side, characteristic of the outer coast. This grouping of half a dozen small islands offers refuge to boats from the swells, winds, and tides between the open ocean and Icy Strait. Caution should be used in traveling through the narrow openings between islands. The notorious laundry chute is an appropriate name as your boat can be swiftly drawn through this pass at certain tides. There are also two small private parcels of land on the main island. The Strait is a passageway for a major portion of the water that travels through to the areas of Chatham Strait, Lynn Canal, and beyond. The higher the tides, the more the water moves through. Although this has a disadvantage in planning travel, it is also a key reason there is so much marine life in Icy Strait. This is an excellent place in southeast Alaska to watch for marine mammals. Humpback whales and Orca can be seen in abundance in Icy Strait as well as seals, Steller sea lions, sea otters, and porpoises. An abundance of sea and land birds can also be seen near the shores including murrelets, gulls, terns and bald eagles. The islands host brown bears, Sitka black-tailed deer, marten, mink, land otter, red squirrels, ptarmigan, gray squirrels, and grouse. The lnian Islands were used for fox farms in the 1920s and still provide harbor for commercial fishing vessels.

The issue arose, most notably, between the theories of contemporary philosophers Alexius Meinong (see Meinong's 1904 book Investigations in Theory of Objects and Psychology)Alexius Meinong, \\"√úber Gegenstandstheorie\\" (\\"The Theory of Objects\\"), in Alexius Meinong, ed. (1904). Untersuchungen zur Gegenstandstheorie und Psychologie (Investigations in Theory of Objects and Psychology), Leipzig: Barth, pp. 1‚Äì51. and Bertrand Russell (see Russell's 1905 article \\"On Denoting\\").Bertrand Russell, \\"On Denoting,\\" Mind, New Series, Vol. 14, No. 56. (Oct. 1905), pp. 479‚Äì493. online text, , JSTOR text. Russell's critique of Meinong's theory of objects, also known as the Russellian view, became the established view on the problem of nonexistent objects. In late modern philosophy, the concept of the \\"square circle\\" had been notably discussed in Gottlob Frege's The Foundations of Arithmetic (1884).Gottlob Frege, The Foundations of Arithmetic, Northwestern University Press, 1980[1884], p. 87. The dual copula strategy The strategy employed is the dual copula strategy, also known as the dual predication approach,Jacek Pasniczek, The Logic of Intentional Objects: A Meinongian Version of Classical Logic, Springer, 1997, p. 125. which is used to make a distinction between relations of properties and individuals. It entails creating a sentence that is not supposed to make sense by forcing the term \\"is\\" into ambiguous meaning. The dual copula strategy was originally brought to prominence in contemporary philosophy by Ernst Mally.Mally, Ernst, Gegenstandstheoretische Grundlagen der Logik und Logistik, Leipzig: Barth, 1912, ¬ß33.Ernst Mally ‚Äì The Metaphysics Research Lab Other proponents of this approach include: H√©ctor-Neri Casta√±eda, William J. Rapaport, and Edward N. Zalta.Dale Jacquette, Meinongian Logic: The Semantics of Existence and Nonexistence, Walter de Gruyter, 1996, p. 17. By borrowing Zalta's notational method (Fb stands for b exemplifies the property of being F; bF stands for b encodes the property of being F), and using a revised version of Meinongian object theory which makes use of a dual copula distinction (MOTdc), we can say that the object called \\"the round square\\" encodes the property of being round, the property of being square, all properties implied by these, and no others. But it is true that there are also infinitely many properties being exemplified by an object called the round square (and, really, any object)‚Äîe.g. the property of not being a computer, and the property of not being a pyramid. Note that this strategy has forced \\"is\\" to abandon its predicative use, and now functions abstractly. When one now analyzes the round square copula using the MOTdc, one will find that it now avoids the three common paradoxes: (1) The violation of the law of contradiction, (2) The paradox of claiming the property of existence without actually existing, and (3) producing counterintuitive consequences. Firstly, the MOTdc shows that the round square does not exemplify the property of being round, but the property of being round and square. Thus, there is no subsequent contradiction. Secondly, it avoids the conflict of existence/non-existence by claiming non- physical existence: by the MOTdc, it can only be said that the round square simply does not exemplify the property of occupying a region in space. Finally, the MOTdc avoids counterintuitive consequences (like a 'thing' having the property of nonexistence) by stressing that the round square copula can be said merely to encode the property of being round and square, not actually exemplifying it. Thus, logically, it does not belong to any set or class. In the end, what the MOTdc really does is created a kind of object: a nonexistent object that is very different from the objects we might normally think of. Occasionally, references to this notion, while obscure, may be called \\"Meinongian objects.\\" The dual property strategy Making use of the notion of \\"non-physically existent\\" objects is controversial in philosophy, and created the buzz for many articles and books on the subject during the first half of the 20th century. There are other strategies for avoiding the problems of Meinong's theories, but they suffer from serious problems as well. First is the dual property strategy, also known as the nuclear‚Äìextranuclear strategy. Mally introduced the dual property strategy,Mally, Ernst. 1909. \\"Gegenstandstheorie und Mathematik\\", Bericht √úber den III. Internationalen Kongress f√ºr Philosophie zu Heidelberg (Report of the Third International Congress of Philosophy, Heidelberg), 1‚Äì5 September 1908; ed. Professor Dr. Theodor Elsenhans, 881‚Äì886.

The dual property strategy was eventually adopted by Meinong. Other proponents of this approach include: Terence Parsons and Richard Routley. According to Meinong, it is possible to distinguish the natural (nuclear) properties of an object, from its external (extranuclear) properties. Parsons identifies four types of extranuclear properties: ontological, modal, intentional, technical‚Äîhowever, philosophers dispute Parson's claims in number and kind. Additionally, Meinong states that nuclear properties are either constitutive or consecutive, meaning properties that are either explicitly contained or implied/included in a description of the object. Essentially the strategy denies the possibility for objects to have only one property, and instead they may have only one nuclear property. Meinong himself, however, found this solution to be inadequate in several ways and its inclusion only served to muddle the definition of an object. The other worlds strategy There is also the other worlds strategy. Similar to the ideas explained with possible worlds theory, this strategy employs considering that logical principles and the law of contradiction have limits, but without assuming that everything is true. Enumerated and championed by Graham Priest, who was heavily influenced by Routley, this strategy forms the notion of \\"noneism\\". In short, assuming there exist infinite possible and impossible worlds, objects are freed from necessarily existing in all worlds, but instead may exist in impossible worlds (where the law of contradiction does not apply, for example) and not in the actual world. Unfortunately, accepting this strategy entails accepting the host of problems that come with it, such as the ontological status of impossible worlds.

Retrieved March 19, 2010 Nick is portrayed by Joshua Morrow and Sharon is portrayed by Sharon Case. The characters of Nick and Sharon first met in 1994 and soon became involved. They were faced with a range of problems, such as their different levels of class, Sharon's ex-boyfriend Matt Clark (Eddie Cibrian), and Sharon's secret past: she was pregnant three years earlier and gave up the child, Cassie (Camryn Grimes), for adoption. The couple married in February 1996, and after having a son, Noah (Robert Adamson), Sharon was reunited with Cassie. Nick grew to love Cassie and became her adoptive father. Sharon's best friend Grace Turner (Jennifer Gareis) developed an obsession with Nick and slept with him twice. In the following years, the couple dealt with the return of Matt Clark and infidelity on both sides among other obstacles, which Nick and Sharon managed to eventually move past. In 2005, Cassie was killed off in a car accident, which led to Nick's affair with Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford, Gina Tognoni). Nick impregnated Phyllis, who gave birth to a daughter named Summer (Hunter King), which ultimately meant the end of Nick and Sharon's marriage. Despite Nick's marriage to Phyllis and Sharon's marriages to Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) and Nick's brother Adam Newman (Michael Muhney, Justin Hartley), Nick and Sharon's pattern of periodically getting back together and breaking up continued. A 2009 affair (while both were still married to others) resulted in the birth of another daughter, Faith (Alyvia Alyn Lind). The couple's marriage lasted for over ten years, which is considered a rarity in the soap opera genre. Nick and Sharon timeline Soap Opera Digest Retrieved June 9, 2007 The couple is often referred to by the portmanteau \\"Shick\\" by fans on internet, message boards and in magazines. The Huffington Post and Soap Opera Digest named them one of soap opera's greatest supercouples. Their 2009 on-screen reunion was a high-profile event on the show which garnered media attention, while lifting the show's ratings by nearly half a million viewers. Casting  Nick was born on-screen on the episode dated December 31, 1988. In 1994, his birth-date was revised to December 31, 1976, when Joshua Morrow began playing the role. Sharon was initially portrayed by Monica Potter and later Heidi Mark, before Case took over four months into the character's duration. Case was cast as Sharon Collins following a screen test with Morrow, with several other actresses also being screen tested. Morrow said: \\"They had all these beautiful actresses come in and Sharon was clearly 'The Sharon'! (...) I said, 'She is definitely the best of all of them.' Now my word didn‚Äôt mean anything back then, as I was just a kid off the bus from Oklahoma.\\"  History  Teenage years (1994‚Äì96) Eighteen-year-old Nicholas \\"Nick\\" Newman, son of the rich business tycoon Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) and his ex-wife Nikki Abbott (Melody Thomas Scott), met Sharon Collins, a student from modest means who recently relocated from Madison, Wisconsin to Genoa City. Although it was \\"love at first sight\\", Nick was dating Amy Wilson (Julianne Morris) and Sharon was dating Matt Clark (Eddie Cibrian). However, they soon broke off their other relations and became a couple. Nikki did not approve of Sharon and her mother Doris Colins (Karen Hensel) because of their lower class status. Nick became increasingly angry at the pressure from his family to break up with Sharon, although Victor fully accepted Sharon. Nick dreamed of running away and eloping with Sharon, but Sharon refused because of the high class status of the Newman family. Matt became extremely jealous of Nick and Sharon, and although he began dating Amy, began scheming to break them up. Matt investigated Sharon's past and found out her deepest secret which she was keeping from Nick; she lost her virginity to her high-school boyfriend from Madison, Frank Barritt (Phil Dozois), which resulted in a pregnancy. Sharon gave her baby up for adoption, unable to provide for it. Nick believed it was a lie and that Sharon was a virgin, and confronted Matt at the Crimson Lights coffeehouse. It turned into a physical altercation in which Nick was badly beaten by Matt. Eventually, Nick and Sharon broke up after he discovered about her lies. Unable to stay apart, Nick and Sharon reunited within weeks. However, Matt became enraged and trapped Sharon in his car where he raped her. Traumatized and humiliated, Sharon kept the rape to herself. Nick and Sharon decided to elope. However, on their first night together, Sharon pulled away from making love to Nick and finally confessed that she was raped by Matt. Nick ran to confront Matt at his apartment, only to discover Matt lying in a pool of blood having been shot. Nick's DNA was found on the gun and he was arrested. Victor hired Paul Williams (Doug Davidson) and a range of attorneys to free Nick, who had to go to trial for attempted murder. Nick was found guilty and sent to jail, where he spent Christmas of 1995. However, in February 1996 he was acquitted when Amy came forward as the actual shooter after Matt tried to rape her. Amy was in seclusion after recovering from mental trauma. Matt skipped town after he became in trouble for lying in court, claiming he remembered Nick shooting him. Nick and Sharon then married. Marriage and parenthood (1997‚Äì99) Jennifer Gareis (pictured) played Grace, Sharon's best friend who schemed to break the couple up. At the beginning of her marriage to Nick, Sharon became insecure and felt like she had to have a child so that Nick would stay tied to her. During this period, Nick hired Sharon's best friend from Madison Grace Turner (Josie Davis) to work at his father's company Newman Enterprises. Sharon became pregnant by deliberately skipping her contraceptive pills, which she confessed to Nikki. Nick asked Sharon to have an abortion. Without his permission, she arranged to have an abortion to save her marriage. However, at the last minute, Nick realized he was wrong and stopped it from happening. Grace's old boyfriend Tony Viscardi (Nick Scotti) arrived in town but she resisted him because she began having fantasies about Nick. Their firstborn baby son Noah Christian Newman was born prematurely on March 3, 1997 after Sharon fell. Noah became ill and nearly died. Believing he would eventually die, Grace (now played by Jennifer Gareis) and Tony tracked down Sharon's long lost eight-year-old daughter Cassie (Camryn Grimes) and brought her to town, believing it would help Sharon get through Noah's death. However, once Noah survived, Grace kept Cassie so she could raise her as her own, as her \\"pet\\". She did this despite knowing very well Sharon was definitely Cassie's biological mother. Nick became drunk one night after partying with his college friends, the same night Sharon was sick with a cold and Grace was babysitting Noah. Nick entered the nursery and had sex with Grace who he believed was Sharon, leaving him guilt- ridden after he found out it wasn't. Sharon eventually found out Cassie was her daughter and Cassie came to live with her and Nick at their home, a refurbished cottage on the Newman Ranch. Despite Grace's engagement to Tony, she continued to dream about Nick and wanted to take him away from his family. During a trip to Denver, Nick cheated on Sharon with Grace after drinking, despite him claiming their relationship was only \\"professional\\". Sharon left Nick afterwards, feeling like a fool. Nick and Sharon remained apart for a number of months. However, they worked together in court to legally adopt Cassie as their own. Nick moved back into the family home, Case explained \\"Neither knew what the other wanted. So, Sharon went to bed and Nick slept on the couch.\\" During this time, they reconnected and eventually got back together, as Nick grew even closer to Cassie as his own daughter. The show's then head-writer at the time Kay Alden, said \\"This has been a long time coming for Sharon and Nick [...] For the last several months, there's been a lot of stop-and-go ‚Äî and mixed messages ‚Äî between them. But now the feelings they have for each other are definitely clear.\\" Sharon and Nick were awarded custody of Cassie, and Nick adopted Cassie and became her father. Joshua Morrow stated: \\"Nick has accepted Cassie as his daughter. He loves her as much as he loves Noah. She's an incredible child and Nick is crazy about her\\". Of their reunion, Case said: \\"Happiness doesn't just mean lying around in bed saying, 'I love you' everyday for the rest of their lives. Love expresses itself in other ways. One way is getting over the hurdles of life together. So, I'm sure they will be more hurdles to come.\\" Describing Nick's redemption after his infidelity, Case said: \\"Every time Sharon sees Nick take control, she feels like he's her knight in shining armor. After what happened between Nick and Grace, Nick really needed to prove himself for Sharon to feel better about what happened. Now, time has passed and he has redeemed himself. Nick didn't want to be a father ‚Äî and look at him now.\\" Infidelities, Cassie's death and divorce (2000‚Äì06) Matt Clark was re-introduced by Rick Hearst (pictured) under the identity Carter Mills, having undergone severe plastic surgery. In 2000, Nick and Sharon experienced a health scare when Cassie nearly had tuberculosis, but ended up being okay. The couple became the new owners of the Crimson Lights coffeehouse, their teenage hang-out spot. Having undergone severe cosmetic surgery, Matt Clark (now played by Rick Hearst) returned to Genoa City under the fake identity 'Carter Mills' and began working at the coffeehouse where he schemed with Larry Warton (David \\"Shark\\" Fralick) to frame Nick for selling drugs. Matt became a \\"beloved\\" employee and Sharon invited him over to the ranch, where he attempted to drug and date rape her but failed. His plan to have Nick thrown in jail worked, and he lured Sharon to an isolated cabin where he nearly raped her until help showed up and he ran. Matt was driven off a cliff in a car driven by the unstable Tricia Dennison (Sabryn Genet). A dying Matt told Nick that he raped Sharon, and later pulled out his own ventilator and framed Nick for his death; Nick was arrested again but eventually freed. Sharon became pregnant and Nick believed it was Matt's child, and wanted her to give it up for adoption. They argued, causing Sharon to fall and give birth to a stillborn baby-girl which was later confirmed through DNA testing to be, in fact, Nick's child. They drifted apart and the marriage began to breakdown. Sharon became hostile towards Nick, resenting him, and she left him. Months later, they came close to a reunion. Sharon mistakenly believed Nick slept with Grace again, so she slept with the Newman handyman, Diego Guittierez (Greg Vaughan). Angry, Nick assaulted Diego and had sex with Grace, which he immediately regretted. Sharon and Nick spent the Christmas of 2002 together for the sake of the kids, but once it was finished, Sharon realized she needed to move on and decided to file for divorce. In 2003, realizing he needs to fix his marriage, Nick goes to give Sharon flowers but is shocked when he sees Victor kissing Sharon. Humiliated, Sharon leaves town. During this time, Sharon Case was absent for months due to lengthy contract negotiations which left her fate on the show in question. She eventually struck a deal with the producers and returned, after being off- screen from February 17 to May 1. Instead of having the character depart fully or be killed off, executive producer at the time David Shaughnessy chose to have her leave town. While away, Sharon became depressed and on the verge of suicide. During her absence, Cassie nearly dies after falling into an icy pond, and resented Sharon upon her return. Sharon was confronted with her past when a man who she had sex with and who later abused her while she was out of town, Cameron Kirsten (Linden Ashby), came to town with intent of sleeping with her; as well as Cassie's biological father Frank arriving in town. He attacks her on New Year's Eve and she throws a bottle at him; Sharon believes that she murdered Cameron. However, he turned out to be alive; Cameron killed Frank and used his dead body to make Sharon believe it was his corpse. Case praised the storyline as one of her favorite, feeling that Sharon was still a hero; stating: \\"Your romantic lead shouldn't just be a simple romantic lead. Sharon was that for a long time. She was in this love story with Nick and nothing really happened to her. You can only carry that so far.\\" Sharon and Nick was finally solid in their marriage again, after two years of tumultuous events. In 2005, 14-year-old Cassie was killed in a car accident after attempting to drive drunken Daniel Romalotti (Michael Graziadei) home. Nick became distant from Sharon, causing Sharon to become close to Brad Carlton (Don Diamont), who she worked with while being a spokesperson for Newman Enterprises' Beauty of Nature cosmetics line. Nick also inched closer to a co- worker, Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford). Sharon and Brad shared a kiss, but she confessed it to Nick, wanting to work on her marriage. However, Nick was having an affair with Phyllis. When Sharon failed to commit to him, Brad proposed to Nick's sister Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle) instead. Sharon was furious when she found out about Nick's affair with Phyllis. Despite this, the couple remained together and eventually decided to stay married. Phyllis became pregnant with Nick's child. Sharon asked Nick for a divorce and they ended their marriage; he moved on and married Phyllis. In December 2006, Nick and Phyllis welcomed a baby girl, Summer Newman. Love triangles and Faith's birth (2007‚Äì10) mistress Phyllis, who was played by Michelle Stafford (pictured). After her divorce from Nick and his marriage to Phyllis, Sharon moved on by marrying a rival to the Newman family, Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman). Bergman said that it was \\"only appropriate\\" that the couple found each other, explaining: \\"Wherever Sharon goes, she is embarrassed. Will Phyllis come walking around the corner? But Sharon doesn't have any reason to be embarrassed with Jack.\\" However, Bergman also noted that Jack's intamicy with her \\"all happens so quickly\\" which could indicate he was up to something manipulative. Case praised the marriage as being a good representation of modern-day marriages. Additionally, she felt that Sharon had \\"lost her identity\\" after divorcing Nick and Cassie's death, and found a new one in her marriage to Jack. Nick and Sharon remained close despite their separate marriages. In 2007, Nick ended up in a plane crash, losing his memory. When he returned, he thought it was 2005, believing he was married to Sharon and Cassie was alive. He even kissed Sharon; but regained his memory and returned to Phyllis and their infant daughter, Summer. Phyllis became jealous of Sharon's place in Nick's life, prompting her to write an article in their magazine Restless Style, in which she described Sharon as a \\"needy\\" \\"gum- chewing twit\\" who twirls her hair. Nick was angry at Phyllis for berating the mother of his children, although it was evident that he still loved Sharon and was protective of her. Stafford said: \\"He [Nick] Freaks. She wrote this scathing thing. But Nick says it's not appropriate for her to go after the mother of his son like that,\\" In January 2009, Sharon went to the Abbott cabin to have time for herself after the breakdown of her marriage to Jack. Nick showed up because Noah was ice-skating and fell, suffering hypothermia. After becoming trapped in the cabin during a blizzard, Nick found a letter Sharon wrote to him (but didn't intend to show him) which professed her undying love for him. He confronted her and they made love. Prior to this, Brad had come to the cabin to profess his love for Sharon. On his way out, he ended up dying by saving Noah from the ice. Discussing the plot, Case said that Sharon wants Nick \\"more than anyone\\" but would only have him under \\"certain terms\\" which includes him leaving Phyllis. Additionally, she said that she wouldn't want Nick and Sharon reunite if there wasn't any conflict. That April, they were at the cabin again searching for Noah and ended up making love, resulting in Sharon becoming pregnant. During an interview with The Daily News Case said that Nick constantly changing his mind whether to be with Sharon or Phyllis \\"throws everything into a spin\\" and causes Sharon to make her decisions \\"all over again because she has new information\\". Also weighing in on the reunion, Morrow told TV Guide: \\"The fans have wanted this for a long time [...] it is going to be a very messy journey getting these two back together as a solid couple, but I am sure it will happen.\\" Sharon briefly lied about the baby's paternity because of Summer becoming ill, and stated that Jack was the father. The truth came out, but Faith \\"died\\" at birth, Nick and Sharon grieved the loss of their child. In reality, Faith was stolen by Nick's brother Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), who gave her to Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson) to raise as her own after he caused Ashley to miscarry. Without knowledge of this, Sharon romanced and married Adam. After reuniting with Faith, Nick and Sharon grew even closer. Nick and Phyllis broke up and got a divorce, leading him to reunite with Sharon. He proposed to her, and she accepted. However, Sharon could not get Adam out of her head and slept with him in New Orleans. Nick left Sharon after she cheated, and she began to devote her time to get charges against Adam for the murder of his ex-wife Skye Lockhart (Laura Stone). Reunion and custody battles (2011‚Äì15) Michael Muhney (pictured) played Nick's half brother Adam, who began a relationship with Sharon after kidnapping Nick and Sharon's baby. In the process of trying to save Adam from being sent to jail for Skye's death, Sharon tracks down Skye in Hawaii; Skye falls into a volcano and dies. Sharon loses custody of Faith to Nick, who won't accept her relationship with Adam. Sharon is arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment for her murder; she later skips town and poses under the identity 'Sheri Coleman' for months in New Mexico. During this time, Genoa City believed her dead, leaving Nick devastated. Nick had brief romances with Phyllis and his former step-mother Diane Jenkins (Maura West). Sharon eventually returned to town alive and was acquitted. Throughout 2011, Case voiced her support of Sharon being paired with Adam. Commenting on whether Nick and Sharon were \\"over\\", Case said she doesn't think they \\"will ever be over\\", and they aren't on right now because of her romance with Adam. In January 2012, Sharon regained joint custody of Faith. She also married Victor in a storyline which saw him disappear; and she took over the family company, Newman Enterprises. Nick and Victoria tried to stop Sharon's explosive run as CEO of Newman but failed; at one point, Nick went up against Sharon at the courts. Victor eventually returned and made sure Sharon paid. After heavily drinking, Sharon burned down the main-house at the Newman ranch. Nick forgave Sharon after it was revealed she was suffering from bipolar disorder during the time she did all those things. After two years of being bitter towards one another, Nick and Sharon began co-parenting again and he has vowed to be there for her, so that she can't turn to Adam for support again. Around this time, Morrow stated that as an actor he did not know \\"how in the world\\" the writers could reunite Nick and Sharon \\"anytime\\" soon, but stated: \\"I truly believe in my heart they belong together.\\" Discussing who Sharon's \\"true love\\" is, Case stated: \\"Nick came first, so maybe that would hold more weight. But her love for Adam is just as deep.\\" In mid 2013, a mentally fragile Sharon began feeling nostalgic regarding her relationship with Nick, having been dumped by Adam. In a twist, it is revealed that the original paternity test conducted years earlier to determine whether Summer (now aged to 18 years old) was fathered by Jack or Nick was inconclusive; Nick claimed paternity over Summer, wanting another daughter following Cassie's death. When Summer became involved with Jack's son Kyle Abbott (Hartley Sawyer)‚Äîher possible half brother‚ÄîNick conducted another paternity DNA test. Sharon learned of this, and switched the results, to make everyone believe Nick wasn't Summer's father, so that she could comfort and win him back. A fight between Phyllis and Sharon (after Phyllis overheard Sharon confessing to switching the results) ended with Phyllis falling down a flight of stairs and into a coma. Speaking of these events Case stated: \\"Sharon really does feel justified in what she is doing. In fact, she feels she is doing what needs to be done. She feels that hers and Nick‚Äôs destinies, and Cassie‚Äôs destiny, and everyone‚Äôs life was compromised by Phyllis having this baby, because Nick and Phyllis had an affair, and Nick wanted to get back with Sharon.\\" Sharon then began plotting to win her \\"high school sweetheart\\" back from his fianc√©, Phyllis's sister Avery Bailey Clark (Jessica Collins), to no avail. It was revealed that Sharon was neglecting her bipolar disorder medication the whole time and eventually got her health back on track, but continued to debate whether or not she should tell Nick about Summer's true paternity. Towards the end of 2013 and beginning of 2014, Nick and Sharon began reconnecting romantically. Speaking of their time apart, Case opined: \\"I think it‚Äôs time for Nick and Sharon to get back together, and I am happy about that\\", and stated that 2014 was the \\"Year of Shick\\". Visions of a Ghost Cassie, who appears to be at the age she would have been had she lived, regularly appeared to Sharon while she was off her medication. A vengeful Victor hired a Cassie lookalike, Mariah Copeland (Camryn Grimes), to gaslight/haunt Sharon, so that Nick will question her sanity once more. Through Mariah, Victor discovers that Sharon is hiding a secret, but fails to discover what it is. To stop having these \\"visions\\", Sharon undergoes electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which causes her to experience missing gaps in her memories, and she forgets changing Summer's DNA results. Morrow dubbed Victor's actions as \\"evil\\", and while speaking of Sharon's secret about Summer's paternity, stated: \\"When it comes out, it‚Äôs certainly going to create a problem for Nick and Sharon. In September 2014, Nick proposes to Sharon once again and she accepts. Later that month, a special Nick and Sharon episode aired, where twenty of the show's characters ended up arrested altogether after the couple's Bachelor/Bachelorette party. The Soap Opera Network called this a \\"first for daytime television\\". Phyllis ends up waking up from her coma and stops the wedding. Soon afterwards, Phyllis exposes Sharon's memories and secrets. Nick and Sharon break up, and enter another bitter custody battle over Faith. New head writer at the time Charles Pratt, Jr. said, \\"The first thing I did was take Sharon's child away from her, and I did that because it defines passion in the character\\", opining that Sharon \\"shouldn't just be in a monogamous relationship with Nick raising Faith. Maybe that's what some in the audience want but, to me, that would be a great waste of Sharon Case's talent.\\" Recent events (2016‚Äìpresent) After several years apart, Nick and Sharon reunite in May 2018 after moving in together. New head writer Mal Young noted: \\"Sharon's so different now\\", and explained that Nick and Sharon's relationship would be investigated, saying: \\"They‚Äôve been together since they were teenagers and no matter how much they tear themselves apart, something brings them back together. Their path of true love will never run smooth.\\"  Reception  Morrow and Case at the Monte-Carlo Television Festival in 2013. Nick and Sharon are recognized as a fictional supercouple in the soap opera genre. They are popularly referred to as \\"Shick\\", a portmanteau which combines the names Sharon and Nick. On a list of \\"Greatest Soap Opera Supercouples\\" compiled by Kim Potts of The Huffington Post, Nick and Sharon were placed 16th. Potts noted, \\"Young love hasn't turned out to be enduring love for Nick and Sharon, whose multiple affairs and tragic loss of daughter Cassie in a car accident led to the end of their marriage. Nick is now married to Phyllis (who he began an affair with after Cassie's death), but he can't keep his nose out of Sharon's business, much to Phyllis' chagrin, and a Nick/Sharon reunion is always a possibility.\\" On-Air On-Soaps wrote that Nick and Sharon have a \\"tortured\\" past together. Nick and Sharon are often compared to Nick's parents, Victor and Nikki Newman, who are considered one of the genre's leading supercouples. Robin Raven of Yahoo! TV noted that \\"Sharon and Nick Newman are following the footsteps of Victor and Nikki Newman in how many times they break up and get back together.\\" Nick and Sharon were named the \\"Best Couple\\" of the year 1996 by Soap Opera Digest. Nick and Sharon were nominated for \\"Best Chemistry\\" at the CBS Fan Awards for 2014. The love triangle of Sharon, Nick and Phyllis garnered attention and was considered one of the genre's most titillating storylines. Soap Opera Digest named it the \\"Best Love Triangle\\". Jamaica Gleaner was enthralled by the twists and turns of the love triangle and published an interview with Michelle Stafford; the newspaper asked whether Nick would end his ten-year marriage to Sharon and rather enter into an official romance with her pregnant character Phyllis. Stafford replied, \\"In a perfect world, she'd wish [the baby was] Nick's. But he's married; he's not going to leave Sharon. And she doesn't want him to.\\" The triangle was also a topic of debate during its run. Daniel R. Coleridge of TV Guide labeled the week Phyllis discovered she was expecting as a \\"can't-miss week\\" for the popular triangle. Aubrey Hammack, a writer for AuthorsDen, analysed the storyline and published an article on the matter of adultery. He cited the storyline as realistic, \\"Men are notorious for saying; I can separate my sexual side from my emotions. Well, unless you are a person without a conscience, this is impossible. Most men just don‚Äôt realize that once you have sex with someone, that the emotions kick in not to mention the feelings of being in love and caring about that someone you are having the affair with. When this happens, things spin wildly out of control.\\" Fall Out From Affairs Retrieved June 9, 2007 With Phyllis and Nick gaining a fan following, On-Air On-Soaps referred to this as the \\"Phick vs. Shick\\" fan-base war. Another notable love triangle formed between Sharon, Nick and his brother, Adam, in later years. Heather Tooley, also of Yahoo! TV, regarded Sharon as having \\"always been\\" Nick's damsel in distress, noting that his \\"undeniable love\\" led to the end of his marriage to Phyllis. Tooley furthermore noted that once Sharon's relationship with Adam would face trouble, \\"Nick may find himself on call to help his ex-wife.\\" In September 2012, when Morrow stated on The Talk that he believed Nick and Sharon were \\"endgame\\", Jamey Giddens of the website Zap2it wrote: \\"This revelation caused fans of the \\"Shick\\" pairing to rejoice, while \\"Phick\\" lovers have been storming social media sites in anger.\\" Nick and Sharon's highly anticipated 2009 reunion was met with a notable public reaction. SoapNet wrote \\"the stage was being set for a much-anticipated reunion between first loves Nick Newman and Sharon Collins. Nick's wife, Phyllis, had been scheming to keep them apart for months, and a lot of fans were looking forward to her comeuppance just as much as Nick and Sharon's hookup.\\" Additionally, the Soap Opera Network magazine noted a \\"sudden boom\\" in ratings in the episodes surrounding their reunion, which was also attributed to other subplots. The show gained 447,000 total viewers for the week of January 26‚Äì30, which was described as \\"pretty incredible\\" by SoapNet. Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps said, \\"Many fans were overjoyed that Nick and Sharon finally reconnected and made love in the cabin.\\" Of working with Joshua Morrow, Case stated: \\"I feel most comfortable when I am working with him. We have worked together for so many years, and even if I have not worked with him in a long time, I go right back into a groove with him that‚Äôs familiar and easy\\".

In 1916 the keeper's wife gave birth to a baby that summer at the station. According to the Alabama Lighthouse Association web site, the keeper brought a dairy cow to the station and corralled it on a section of the lower deck because his wife was unable to nurse the newborn baby. All had to be evacuated when the station survived but was damaged by a hurricane that year. The light was automated in 1935. The lighthouse was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 30, 1974. In 1984 the lighthouse was stabilized by Middle Bay Light Centennial Commission in preparation for the centennial celebration. In 1996 the Coast Guard loaned the original Fresnel lens to the Ft. Morgan Museum for public display. In 2002 restoration efforts were begun to repair the lighthouse. In 2003, a real-time weather station was added to the lighthouse by the Dauphin Island Sea Lab and the Mobile Bay National Estuary Program. Still running, the weather station, one of seven in Mobile Bay, samples precipitation, total and quantum solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, barometric pressure, water temperature, salinity, water depth, and dissolved oxygen. These data can be seen in real- time at www.mymobilebay.com. From late 2011 - mid 2014 currents and waves were also displayed. Light The light itself Whale oil was the first fuel used and the lighthouse tenders worked in shifts making sure that the lamps did not go out and smoke the lens. In later years kerosene was used and eventually they were converted to electricity.

Entrance to the Shevchenko Scientific Society at 63 Fourth Avenue in Manhattan The Shevchenko Scientific Society () is a Ukrainian scientific society devoted to the promotion of scholarly research and publication that was founded in 1873. Unlike the government-funded National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, the society is a public organization. It was reestablished in Ukraine in 1989 during fall of the Soviet Union. Being exiled back in 1940 it now has its branches in several countries around the globe the United States, Canada, Australia, France. The organization is named after famous Ukrainian poet, writer, artist, public and political figure Taras Shevchenko. History It was founded in 1873 in Lemberg (today Lviv), at that time the capital of the Austrian crown land of Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, as a literary society devoted to the promotion of Ukrainian language literature initially under the name Shevchenko Society. It was established soon after another cultural society better known as Prosvita (Enlightenment). At that time any publication in Ukrainian language was prohibited in the Russian-controlled Ukraine (Little Russia), from the beginning it attracted the financial and intellectual support of writers and patrons of Ukrainian background from the Russian Empire. The Shevchenko Scientific Society was created on an idea of a writer Oleksandr Konyskyi and the Shevchenko's contemporary Dmytro Pylchykov with a financial support of Yelyzaveta Myloradovych-Skoropadska.Appeal of the Shevchenko Scientific Society Office in America to Head of Ukrainian Committee of Shevchenko National Prize academician Borys Oliynyk (–ó–≤–µ—Ä–Ω–µ–Ω–Ω—è –£–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏ –ù–∞—É–∫–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ –¢–æ–≤–∞—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–≤–∞ —ñ–º. –®–µ–≤—á–µ–Ω–∫–∞ –≤ –ê–º–µ—Ä–∏—Ü—ñ –¥–æ –ì–æ–ª–æ–≤–∏ –∫–æ–º—ñ—Ç–µ—Ç—É –ù–∞—Ü—ñ–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ—ó –ø—Ä–µ–º—ñ—ó –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏ —ñ–º. –¢. –ì. –®–µ–≤—á–µ–Ω–∫–∞ –∞–∫–∞–¥–µ–º—ñ–∫–∞ –ë–æ—Ä–∏—Å–∞ –û–ª—ñ–π–Ω–∏–∫–∞). Shevchenko Scientific Society website. 11 January 2016 In 1893, due to the change in its statute the Shevchenko Scientific Society was transformed into a real scholarly multidisciplinary academy of sciences with its periodical the Zapysky NTSh (Notes of the Shevchenko Scientific Society), yet continue to be specialized in the Ukrainian Studies. Throughout most of its history it had three sections: history-philosophical, philological, and mathematically- medical-natural scientific. Under the presidency of the historian, Mykhailo Hrushevsky, it greatly expanded its activities, contributing to both the humanities and the physical sciences, law and medicine, but most specifically once again it concentrated on Ukrainian studies. During this period, one of its most prolific contributors was the poet, folklorist, and literary historian Ivan Franko who headed the philological section. Also during that period the society created several museums, libraries, and archives. By 1914, several hundred volumes of scholarly research and notices had been published by the society including over a hundred volumes of its Zapysky. The First World War interrupted the society's activities, particularly during the Russian occupation in 1914-1915 when the society's collection of works and its print shop were destroyed. After the war and the Polish-Ukrainian conflict, the West Ukraine belonged to Poland. During that time the society lost its government subsidies, but managed to carry on a precarious existence. Its major contributors were the literary historians, Vasyl Shchurat, Kyryl Studynsky, and the historian Ivan Krypiakevych. One of the most important projects of the society was the publication of the first general alphabetic encyclopedia in the Ukrainian language. The Soviet Union annexed the eastern part of the Second Polish Republic including the city of Lviv, which capitulated to the Red Army on 22 September 1939. Upon their occupation of Lviv, the Soviets dissolved the society. Many of its members were arrested and either imprisoned or executed. Among the perished members were such academicians as R. Zubyk, a former Ukrainian minister I. Feshchenko-Chopivsky, a Ukrainian parliamentarian Petro Franko, Kyryl Studynsky, and many others. During the Nazi occupation, the society still was not able to function openly. In 1947, on the initiative of the geographer, Volodymyr Kubiyovych, it was re- founded as an √©migr√© scholarly society in Munich; the Society's European center was later moved to Paris. Other branches were also founded in New York City (1947), Toronto (1949) and Australia (1950), and throughout the Cold War it functioned as a federation of semi-independent societies. During its period in emigration, the major project of the society was again an encyclopedia. Under the editorship of Volodymyr Kubiyovych, it published the great Entsyklopediia ukrainoznavstva (Encyclopedia of Ukrainian Studies) consisting of four major series: the Ukrainian-language thematic encyclopedia in three volumes, the Ukrainian-language alphabetic encyclopedia in 11 volumes, the English-language thematic encyclopedia in two volumes, and the English- language alphabetic one in five volumes. The last compilation, published in Canada under the title Encyclopedia of Ukraine, is available on-line. In 1989, the society was reactivated in the Ukrainian homeland (in Lviv) and once again undertook a large-scale research and publication program. Branches were soon founded in other Ukrainian cities and membership exceeded a thousand, including 125 full voting members.

The first lighthouse was built as a landfall light by June 1822 at a cost of $9,995. The lighthouse was a conical brick masonry tower, tall. It was first lit on 29 September 1822. Fort Morgan was built adjacent to the lighthouse in 1833. The lighthouse was joined by the Sand Island Light across the mouth of the bay, about away in 1858. This resulted in the Mobile Point Lighthouse being downgraded to a harbor light, at the same time a fourth order Fresnel lens was installed. A period photograph (see infobox), taken prior to the American Civil War, shows two shorter masonry towers standing on the beach below the main tower, they served as range lights. The lighthouse was subsequently destroyed by cannonball fire in the Battle of Mobile Bay during the Civil War. After the war, a temporary wooden tower was built and the Fresnel lens, having survived the destruction of the old tower, was transferred to this structure. A iron lattice-work tower was built, along with a new light keepers house, in 1872 as a replacement and the Fresnel lens was transferred to it. It was lit on 15 February 1872. The lighthouse was deactivated in 1966 and the lens was put on display in the Fort Morgan Museum. A radio style skeletal tower was built to replace the original structure. The new tower stands tall. The 1873 tower was dismantled in 1979 and later partially restored near the entrance to the Fort Morgan museum. In 2003 the Alabama Historical Commission had the lighthouse dismantled, transported and stored under contract with Robinson Iron Works, a company located in Alabama that specializes in cast iron restoration. As of August 2007, no restoration had been undertaken or funded by the Alabama Historical Commission or any state body. It is currently in storage at Robinson Iron Works awaiting restoration funding.

Suchet's force won the battle when a lucky hit detonated a large part of the Spanish ammunition supply. The ensuing blast provoked Blake's soldiers into a panicky flight from the battlefield. The action was fought during the Peninsular War, part of the Napoleonic Wars. Belchite is located southeast of Zaragoza. Background General of Division Suchet took command of the III Corps and immediately moved to oust the army of Captain General Blake from Aragon. The resulting Battle of Alca√±iz on 23 May was a victory for the Spanish as they repulsed a Franco-Polish frontal attack. This victory brought Blake's army 25,000 volunteers, many of whom could not be provided with weapons. Blake advanced down the Huerva River with two divisions on the left bank and one division under General Juan Carlos de Ar√©izaga on the right bank. A more circumspect Suchet initially fought on the defensive in the Battle of Mar√≠a on 15 June. The French general sent General of Division Anne-Gilbert Laval with a 2,000-man brigade to watch Ar√©izaga while retaining the rest of his small corps to face Blake. After fending off Blake's attacks for several hours, Suchet went over to the attack when some French reinforcements arrived. He overwhelmed the Spanish right flank and compelled Blake to order a withdrawal. The next day, Suchet advanced against the combined forces of Blake and Ar√©izaga. Blake declined to fight and instead fell back. Discouraged by defeat, 3,000 of Blake's new recruits deserted. Battle After joining with Ar√©izaga's division, Blake was only able to muster 11,000 infantry, 870 cavalry, and nine guns. He drew up this force on some hills in front of the town of Belchite. After Suchet ordered Laval to join him, he massed 12,000 infantry, 1,000 cavalry, and 12 artillery pieces for the battle. The French general paid no attention to the Spanish center and instead sent his two divisions to attack the enemy flanks. General of Division Louis Fran√ßois F√©lix Musnier assaulted the Spanish left flank and began forcing it back into the town. General of Brigade Pierre-Joseph Habert sent his soldiers against the opposite flank. Just as Habert's attack got rolling, a French shell blew up an artillery caisson in the Spanish right rear. The fire spread to some ammunition wagons and soon there was a titanic explosion as Blake's gunpowder supplies detonated. With this, the Spanish soldiers panicked, some throwing down their muskets in order to flee faster. The French swept forward, killing, wounding, or capturing 2,000 Spaniards. They seized all nine of Blake's cannons plus one color and a quantity of food and equipment. Suchet reported losses of 200 killed and wounded. Leaving Musnier's division to observe Blake's survivors, Suchet marched back to Zaragoza.

The building is named after its address of 800 South Fourth Street. The 29-story, high structure was designed by the Louisville architectural firm of Arrasmith and Tyler in a partnership with the Chicago architectural firm of Loewenberg and Loewenberg. History Construction began in 1961 and the building was completed in 1963 at a cost of $6 million. It was built by F. W. \\"Fritz\\" Drybrough, who lived in the penthouse for years. The architect was Louisville architect, W. S. Arrasmith. The 800 was the tallest building in Louisville from 1963 until the completion of PNC Plaza in 1971 and was Louisville's tallest residential building until Waterfront Park Place was completed in 2004. The 800 was considered a very upscale residence in its earlier years but its age and upkeep have dimmed its luster somewhat. Its desirability as residential housing has also been affected over the decades by the somewhat gradual progression of Louisville's central business district from the nearby Broadway area at the time the building was new to the Main Street and Market Street areas several blocks to the north. The building sold for $3.95 million in 1997, considerably less than what it was built for, even without adjusting for inflation, and renovated in 1999. On June 16, 2015, Michigan-based property management firm, Village Green announced the purchase of the 800 Building, and renamed it 800 Tower City Apartments, and began renovations expected to exceed $10 million, and take 18 months. Architectural features The building, which has a continuous-pour reinforced concrete frame, has an aluminum curtain-wall system on its exterior with the color of the aluminum panels being a distinctive turquoise blue. As a result, local residents sometimes refer to it as \\"The Turquoise Tower of Power\\", a nickname used by disc jockeys who used to broadcast from the building in the 1980s. The building features an underground parking garage and four 29th floor penthouses along with an outdoor area on the roof. All rental units, except those on the 2nd floor, have outdoor balconies. The ground floor has in various years featured a restaurant from time to time, and in 2017, Bar Vetti, a new Italian restaurant with indoor and outdoor patio seating opened. The main building of the Louisville Free Public Library is across the intersection of Fourth Street and York Street from the 800.

Amyloid beta is a short peptide that is an abnormal proteolytic byproduct of the transmembrane protein amyloid precursor protein (APP), whose function is unclear but thought to be involved in neuronal development. The presenilins are components of proteolytic complex involved in APP processing and degradation. Amyloid beta monomers are soluble and contain short regions of beta sheet and polyproline II helix secondary structures in solution, though they are largely alpha helical in membranes; however, at sufficiently high concentration, they undergo a dramatic conformational change to form a beta sheet-rich tertiary structure that aggregates to form amyloid fibrils. These fibrils deposit outside neurons in dense formations known as senile plaques or neuritic plaques, in less dense aggregates as diffuse plaques, and sometimes in the walls of small blood vessels in the brain in a process called cerebral amyloid angiopathy. AD is also considered a tauopathy due to abnormal aggregation of the tau protein, a microtubule-associated protein expressed in neurons that normally acts to stabilize microtubules in the cell cytoskeleton. Like most microtubule-associated proteins, tau is normally regulated by phosphorylation; however, in Alzheimer's disease, hyperphosphorylated tau accumulates as paired helical filaments that in turn aggregate into masses inside nerve cell bodies known as neurofibrillary tangles and as dystrophic neurites associated with amyloid plaques. Although little is known about the process of filament assembly, it has recently been shown that a depletion of a prolyl isomerase protein in the parvulin family accelerates the accumulation of abnormal tau. Neuroinflammation is also involved in the complex cascade leading to AD pathology and symptoms. Considerable pathological and clinical evidence documents immunological changes associated with AD, including increased pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Whether these changes may be a cause or consequence of AD remains to be fully understood, but inflammation within the brain, including increased reactivity of the resident microglia towards amyloid deposits, has been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of AD. Neuropathology At a macroscopic level, AD is characterized by loss of neurons and synapses in the cerebral cortex and certain subcortical regions. This results in gross atrophy of the affected regions, including degeneration in the temporal lobe and parietal lobe, and parts of the frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus. Both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are clearly visible by microscopy in AD brains. Plaques are dense, mostly insoluble deposits of protein and cellular material outside and around neurons. Tangles are insoluble twisted fibers that build up inside the nerve cell. Though many older people develop some plaques and tangles, the brains of AD patients have them to a much greater extent and in different brain locations. Biochemical characteristics Fundamental to the understanding of Alzheimer's disease is the biochemical events that leads to accumulation of the amyloid-beta and tau- protein. A delicate balance of the enzymes secretases regulate the amyloid- beta accumulation. Alpha Secretase can render a non-pathological (non- amyloidogenic) Amyloid Beta (DOI: 10.2174/156720512799361655). Recently, a link between cholinergic neuronal activity and the activity of alpha-secretase has been highlighted, which can discourage Amyloid-beta proteins deposition in brain of patients with Alzheimer's Disease. Alzheimer's disease has been identified as a protein misfolding disease, or proteopathy, due to the accumulation of abnormally folded Amyloid-beta proteins in the brains of AD patients. Abnormal amyloid-beta accumulation can first be detected using cerebrospinal fluid analysis and later using positron emission tomography (PET). Although AD shares pathophysiological mechanisms with prion diseases, it is not transmissible like prion diseases. Amyloid-beta, also written AŒ≤, is a short peptide that is a proteolytic byproduct of the transmembrane protein amyloid precursor protein (APP), whose function is unclear but thought to be involved in neuronal development. The presenilins are components of a proteolytic complex involved in APP processing and degradation. Although amyloid beta monomers are harmless, they undergo a dramatic conformational change at sufficiently high concentration to form a beta sheet-rich tertiary structure that aggregates to form amyloid fibrils that deposit outside neurons in dense formations known as senile plaques or neuritic plaques, in less dense aggregates as diffuse plaques, and sometimes in the walls of small blood vessels in the brain in a process called amyloid angiopathy or congophilic angiopathy. AD is also considered a tauopathy due to abnormal aggregation of the tau protein, a microtubule-associated protein expressed in neurons that normally acts to stabilize microtubules in the cell cytoskeleton. Like most microtubule-associated proteins, tau is normally regulated by phosphorylation; however, in AD patients, hyperphosphorylated tau accumulates as paired helical filaments that in turn aggregate into masses inside nerve cell bodies known as neurofibrillary tangles and as dystrophic neurites associated with amyloid plaques. Levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) are reduced. Levels of other neurotransmitters serotonin, norepinephrine, and somatostatin are also often reduced. Replenishing the ACh by anti-cholinesterases is an approved mode of treatment by FDA. An alternative method of stimulating ACh receptors of M1-M3 types by synthetic agonists that have a slower rate of dissociation from the receptor has been proposed as next generation cholinomimetic in Alzheimer's disease[15]. Disease mechanism Although the gross histological features of AD in the brain are well characterized, three major hypotheses have been advanced regarding the primary cause. The oldest hypothesis suggests that deficiency in cholinergic signaling initiates the progression of the disease. Two alternative misfolding hypotheses instead suggest that either tau protein or amyloid beta initiates the cascade. While researchers have not identified a clear causative pathway originating from any of the three molecular hypotheses to explain the gross anatomical changes observed in advanced AD, variants of the amyloid beta hypothesis of molecular initiation have become dominant among the three possibilities. Cholinergic hypothesis The oldest hypothesis is the \\"cholinergic hypothesis\\". It states that Alzheimer's begins as a deficiency in the production of acetylcholine, a vital neurotransmitter. Much early therapeutic research was based on this hypothesis, including restoration of the \\"cholinergic nuclei\\". The possibility of cell-replacement therapy was investigated on the basis of this hypothesis. All of the first-generation anti-Alzheimer's medications are based on this hypothesis and work to preserve acetylcholine by inhibiting acetylcholinesterases (enzymes that break down acetylcholine). These medications, though sometimes beneficial, have not led to a cure. In all cases, they have served to only treat symptoms of the disease and have neither halted nor reversed it. These results and other research have led to the conclusion that acetylcholine deficiencies may not be directly causal, but are a result of widespread brain tissue damage, damage so widespread that cell- replacement therapies are likely to be impractical. More recent hypotheses center on the effects of the misfolded and aggregated proteins, amyloid beta and tau. The two positions are lightheartedly described as \\"ba-ptist\\" and \\"tau-ist\\" viewpoints in one scientific publication. Therein, it is suggested that \\"Tau-ists\\" believe that the tau protein abnormalities initiate the disease cascade, while \\"ba-ptists\\" believe that beta amyloid deposits are the causative factor in the disease. Tau hypothesis The hypothesis that tau is the primary causative factor has long been grounded in the observation that deposition of amyloid plaques does not correlate well with neuron loss. A mechanism for neurotoxicity has been proposed based on the loss of microtubule-stabilizing tau protein that leads to the degradation of the cytoskeleton. However, consensus has not been reached on whether tau hyperphosphorylation precedes or is caused by the formation of the abnormal helical filament aggregates. Support for the tau hypothesis also derives from the existence of other diseases known as tauopathies in which the same protein is identifiably misfolded. However, a majority of researchers support the alternative hypothesis that amyloid is the primary causative agent. Amyloid hypothesis The amyloid hypothesis is initially compelling because the gene for the amyloid beta precursor APP is located on chromosome 21, and patients with trisomy 21 - better known as Down syndrome - who have an extra gene copy exhibit AD-like disorders by 40 years of age. The amyloid hypothesis points to the cytotoxicity of mature aggregated amyloid fibrils, which are believed to be the toxic form of the protein responsible for disrupting the cell's calcium ion homeostasis and thus inducing apoptosis. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that higher levels of a variant of the beta amyloid protein known to form fibrils faster in vitro correlate with earlier onset and greater cognitive impairment in mouse models and with AD diagnosis in humans. However, mechanisms for the induced calcium influx, or proposals for alternative cytotoxic mechanisms, by mature fibrils are not obvious. apomorphine in Alzheimer's disease. A more recent and broadly supported variation of the amyloid hypothesis identifies the cytotoxic species as an intermediate misfolded form of amyloid beta, neither a soluble monomer nor a mature aggregated polymer but an oligomeric species, possibly toroidal or star-shaped with a central channel that may induce apoptosis by physically piercing the cell membrane. This ion channel hypothesis postulates that oligomers of soluble, non-fibrillar AŒ≤ form membrane ion channels allowing unregulated calcium influx into neurons. A related alternative suggests that a globular oligomer localized to dendritic processes and axons in neurons is the cytotoxic species. The prefibrillar aggregates were shown to be able to disrupt the membrane. The cytotoxic-fibril hypothesis presents a clear target for drug development: inhibit the fibrillization process. Much early development work on lead compounds has focused on this inhibition; most are also reported to reduce neurotoxicity, but the toxic-oligomer theory would imply that prevention of oligomeric assembly is the more important process or that a better target lies upstream, for example in the inhibition of APP processing to amyloid beta. For example, apomorphine was seen to significantly improve memory function through the increased successful completion of the Morris Water Maze. ;Soluble intracellular (o)AŒ≤42 Two papers have shown that oligomeric (o)AŒ≤42 (a species of AŒ≤), in soluble intracellular form, acutely inhibits synaptic transmission, a pathophysiology that characterizes AD (in its early stages), by activating casein kinase 2. Isoprenoid changes A 1994 study showed that the isoprenoid changes in Alzheimer's disease differ from those occurring during normal aging and that this disease cannot, therefore, be regarded as a result of premature aging. During aging the human brain shows a progressive increase in levels of dolichol, a reduction in levels of ubiquinone, but relatively unchanged concentrations of cholesterol and dolichyl phosphate. In Alzheimer's disease, the situation is reversed with decreased levels of dolichol and increased levels of ubiquinone. The concentrations of dolichyl phosphate are also increased, while cholesterol remains unchanged. The increase in the sugar carrier dolichyl phosphate may reflect an increased rate of glycosylation in the diseased brain and the increase in the endogenous anti-oxidant ubiquinone an attempt to protect the brain from oxidative stress, for instance induced by lipid peroxidation. Ropren, identified previously in Russia, is neuroprotective in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease. Glucose consumption The human brain is one of the most metabolically active organs in the body and metabolizes a large amount of glucose to produce cellular energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Despite its high energy demands, the brain is relatively inflexible in its ability to utilize substrates for energy production and relies almost entirely on circulating glucose for its energy needs. This dependence on glucose puts the brain at risk if the supply of glucose is interrupted, or if its ability to metabolize glucose becomes defective. If the brain is not able to produce ATP, synapses cannot be maintained and cells cannot function, ultimately leading to impaired cognition. Imaging studies have shown decreased utilization of glucose in the brains of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease patients early in the disease, before clinical signs of cognitive impairment occur. This decrease in glucose metabolism worsens as clinical symptoms develop and the disease progresses. Studies have found a 17%-24% decline in cerebral glucose metabolism in patients with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, compared with age-matched controls. Numerous imaging studies have since confirmed this observation. Abnormally low rates of cerebral glucose metabolism are found in a characteristic pattern in the Alzheimer‚Äôs disease brain, particularly in the posterior cingulate, parietal, temporal, and prefrontal cortices. These brain regions are believed to control multiple aspects of memory and cognition. This metabolic pattern is reproducible and has even been proposed as a diagnostic tool for Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Moreover, diminished cerebral glucose metabolism (DCGM) correlates with plaque density and cognitive deficits in patients with more advanced disease. Diminished cerebral glucose metabolism (DCGM) may not be solely an artifact of brain cell loss since it occurs in asymptomatic patients at risk for Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, such as patients homozygous for the epsilon 4 variant of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE4, a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer‚Äôs disease), as well as in inherited forms of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Given that DCGM occurs before other clinical and pathological changes occur, it is unlikely to be due to the gross cell loss observed in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. In imaging studies involving young adult APOE4 carriers, where there were no signs of cognitive impairment, diminished cerebral glucose metabolism (DCGM) was detected in the same areas of the brain as older subjects with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. However, DCGM is not exclusive to APOE4 carriers. By the time Alzheimer‚Äôs has been diagnosed, DCGM occurs in genotypes APOE3/E4, APOE3/E3, and APOE4/E4. Thus, DCGM is a metabolic biomarker for the disease state.  Insulin signaling  A connection has been established between Alzheimer's disease and diabetes during the past decade, as insulin resistance, which is a characteristic hallmark of diabetes, has also been observed in brains of subjects suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Neurotoxic oligomeric amyloid-Œ≤ species decrease the expression of insulin receptors on the neuronal cell surface and abolish neuronal insulin signaling. It has been suggested that neuronal gangliosides, which take part in the formation of membrane lipid microdomains, facilitate amyloid-Œ≤-induced removal of the insulin receptors from the neuronal surface. In Alzheimer's disease, oligomeric amyloid-Œ≤ species trigger TNF-Œ± signaling. c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation by TNF-Œ± in turn activates stress-related kinases and results in IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, which subsequently blocks downstream insulin signaling. The resulting insulin resistance contributes to cognitive impairment. Consequently, increasing neuronal insulin sensitivity and signaling may constitute a novel therapeutic approach to treat Alzheimer's disease. Oxidative stress Oxidative stress is emerging as a key factor in the pathogenesis of AD. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) over-production is thought to play a critical role in the accumulation and deposition of amyloid beta in AD. Brains of AD patients have elevated levels of oxidative DNA damage in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, but the mitochondrial DNA has approximately 10-fold higher levels than nuclear DNA. Aged mitochondria may be the critical factor in the origin of neurodegeneration in AD. Even individuals with mild cognitive impairment, the phase between normal aging and early dementia, have increased oxidative damage in their nuclear and mitochondrial brain DNA (see Aging brain). Large gene instability hypothesis A bioinformatics analysis in 2017 revealed that extremely large human genes are significantly over-expressed in brain and take part in the postsynaptic architecture. These genes are also highly enriched in cell adhesion Gene Ontology (GO) terms and often map to chromosomal fragile sites. The majority of known Alzheimer's disease risk gene products including the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and gamma-secretase, as well as the APOE receptors and GWAS risk loci take part in similar cell adhesion mechanisms. It was concluded that dysfunction of cell and synaptic adhesion is central to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, and mutational instability of large synaptic adhesion genes may be the etiological trigger of neurotransmission disruption and synaptic loss in brain aging. As a typical example, this hypothesis explains the APOE risk locus of AD in context of signaling of its giant lipoprotein receptor, LRP1b which is a large tumor-suppressor gene with brain-specific expression and also maps to an unstable chromosomal fragile site. The large gene instability hypothesis puts the DNA damage mechanism at the center of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.

Motive power The WSS used a variety of steam locomotives from 1910 until 1957, since the Norfolk and Western Railway continued to operate with steam power, so there was no hurry to dieselize the Winston-Salem Southbound Railway. On April 22, 1957, the railroad caved-in, and four new EMD GP9 diesels arrived, priced at about $190,000 each. With the arrival of diesels, the water tanks and coaling stations of the steam era would soon fall. The four GP9s were purchased from the N&W;, and the swiftly-dieselizing ACL; the two companies then in ownership of the WSS. They were re-painted into two different paint schemes and served from the 1950s to the late 1960s, when the WSS, realizing it wasn't cost- effective to maintain servicing facilities, sent the GP9s back to their respective owners and started to lease equipment from the ACL and N&W.; To this day, the WSS continues to lease road power from the successors of the ACL (CSX) and N&W; (NS).Miller & Vaughn, \\"The Winston-Salem Southbound Railway Including the High Point, Thomasville, and Denton Railroad,\\" (Winston-Salem, 1996). The GP9 units were numbered 1501 (N&W;), 1502 (N&W;), 1503 (ACL), 1504 (ACL).

It has been described as a \\"counterculture anthem, with its lyrics praising the footloose and fancy-free life\\", which reflected Hendrix's restless lifestyle. Instrumentally, the song has a strong rhythmic drive provided by drummer Mitch Mitchell with harmonic support by bassist Noel Redding. \\"Stone Free\\" was issued on December 16, 1966, as the B-side of the Experience's first UK single \\"Hey Joe\\" and later included on the Smash Hits compilation album. In April 1969, Hendrix recorded a revised rendition of the song for possible release as a single. However, it was not used and Reprise Records issued the original recording as a single in the U.S. on September 15, 1969. Hendrix often played \\"Stone Free\\" in concert using extended arrangements, sometimes lasting over fourteen minutes. The revised song and several live recordings were later released. Recording and composition With the first Experience song, \\"Hey Joe\\", completed on October 23, 1966, the group needed a second number for their debut single. Hendrix suggested another cover song, but producer Chas Chandler encouraged him to come up with an original in order to receive song publishing royalties. Hendrix wrote \\"Stone Free\\", his first Experience composition on October 24 after a jam at a London club. (\\"Look Over Yonder\\", recorded by the Experience in 1968, began in 1966 as \\"Mr. Bad Luck\\", written and performed by Hendrix with his band Jimmy James and the Blue Flames in Greenwich Village, New York). The group rehearsed the song, with Chandler (formerly a bassist with the Animals) showing Redding, a guitarist who was new to the bass, some bass lines. \\"Stone Free\\" was recorded at De Lane Lea Studios in London on November 2, 1966. According to Chandler, it was completed in an hour. Overdubbing was minimal, consisting of a cowbell part by Mitchell and an additional guitar line and harmony vocals by Hendrix. Hendrix's vocal for \\"Stone Free\\" has been compared to that for \\"Hey Joe\\". Biographer Keith Shadwick describes it as \\"an almost conversational delivery ... toying with blues intervals in a way that John Lee Hooker would build a blues phrase rather than delivering any defined melodic pattern.\\" The lyrics reflect Hendrix's lifestyle, as he explained in an interview: \\"I stay one or two months in a place and then I must have a change ... I just get so restless, man‚ÄîI might leave right away\\": The lyrics also express his feelings of resentment when he returned to Harlem after exploring the counterculture Greenwich Village: \\"Stone Free\\" is an uptempo song which has a strong rhythmic element, due in large part to Mitchell's jazz-influenced drumming approach. Although he \\"constantly underlines Hendrix's vocals and guitar parts in a dramatic fashion [with] fills and changes of rhythmic emphases\\", Mitchell continues to \\"stress the snare beat\\" and adds quarter-notes on the cowbell. Redding's bass line provides harmonic support similar to a rhythm guitar and has been compared to \\"Philly Dog\\", a Mar-Keys song.Although Roby identifies it as a Rufus Thomas (known for \\"Walking the Dog\\") song, \\"Philly Dog\\" was recorded by the Mar Keys. Roby 2002, p. 61. The verse section is a variation on a blues progression, which uses the beginning eight bars of a twelve-bar blues. The song opens with Hendrix plucking harmonic notes and unlike most of his songs, he uses a standard tuning for the guitar. Guitarist Jeff Beck, who considers \\"Stone Free\\" his favorite Hendrix song, commented, \\"It's got bits of Buddy Guy; it sounds like Les Paul in places. Jimi does every trick in the book and nails it all together so tight that you can't even see the joints.\\" Releases \\"Stone Free\\" was released as the B-side of \\"Hey Joe\\" on December 16, 1966. Although the group was signed to Track Records in the UK, the label was not fully operational, so the single appeared on Polydor Records. In order to ensure the single's success, Hendrix's manager, Michael Jeffery, signed over a portion of the publishing rights to \\"Stone Free\\" as an inducement for radio airplay (since \\"Hey Joe\\" was already published, it was unavailable for such an arrangement). Hendrix's publisher, Abby Schroeder, was reportedly \\"livid\\". He recalled The single became a success and reached number six on the UK Singles Chart. It was later included on the Experience's first compilation album Smash Hits. When \\"Hey Joe\\" was issued in the U.S., Reprise Records included \\"51st Anniversary\\" as the B-side. \\"Stone Free\\" was included on the American Smash Hits album, which was released on July 30, 1969. Almost two months later, it was released as the A-side of a single with \\"If 6 Was 9\\". The single missed the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart, but made an appearance at number 130 on the magazine's Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. The song is included on several later Hendrix compilations, including Stone Free, The Singles Album, Experience Hendrix: The Best of Jimi Hendrix, and The Singles Collection. In April 1969, the Experience recorded a remake of \\"Stone Free\\" with some additional musicians. Since the song had not been released in the U.S. by that time, Hendrix was considering it for his next single. Roger Chapman from Family and Andy Fairweather Low from Amen Corner (two British groups the Experience had toured with) provided background vocals. Hendrix biographer and later producer John McDermott describes the new version as having a \\"more sophisticated arrangement\\" and Shadwick calls it \\"disciplined but spiritless\\". Reprise Records later issued the original \\"Stone Free\\" and the remake was first released on the Alan Douglas-produced Crash Landing album in 1975. Douglas erased the original multitrack recordings and used new backing musicians; however, unlike most of the other songs on the album, Douglas did not take a song writing credit for the new version. The 1969 version was later restored and included on The Jimi Hendrix Experience and Voodoo Child: The Jimi Hendrix Collection. A variation with Billy Cox on bass is included on the West Coast Seattle Boy: The Jimi Hendrix Anthology. Live recordings \\"Stone Free\\" was frequently performed by Hendrix and live recordings with the Experience, Band of Gypsys, and the Cry of Love touring group have been released on albums. Early versions follow the original version, while later ones sometimes extend for over fourteen minutes with improvised guitar and drum solos.

It is part of both the Knoxville Metropolitan Statistical Area and the Morristown Metropolitan Statistical Area. According to the 2000 United States census, the total population of Washburn was 2,508.  History  Forty-one days prior to the naming of the town on June 2, 1898, Knoxville-born Rear Admiral Washburn Maynard, son of local politician and Postmaster General Horace Maynard, fired the first shot of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War from the gunboat USS Nashville off the coast of Cienfuegoes, Cuba. Rear Admiral Washburn Maynard and the USS Nashville were instrumental in the capture of the Spanish steamer Buena Ventura and several other vessels. The crew of the USS Nashville also participated in the May 11, 1898 heroic mission of cutting underwater Spanish telegraph cables. It is proposed that partially in honor of former U.S. Postmaster General Horace Maynard, the post office and the town alike were named in honor of the then recent war hero Washburn Maynard. The town continued to grow well into the early twentieth century. In the 1950s, it was decided that northern Grainger County needed a secondary school of its own. Prior to this, any student who wished to go to school beyond the 8th grade had to find a way to get to Rutledge High School, across Clinch Mountain in the county seat of Rutledge. Washburn School was established to meet this need. Subsequently, as the idea of centralized schooling became popular, the smaller elementary schools, such as Thorn Hill Elementary, Liberty Hill School, and Powder Springs Elementary were closed and combined into the new Washburn Elementary School. At the time, buildings of both Rutledge and Washburn High Schools were built in a similar design. This design similarity is still evident in both schools to this day. In early 2004, the Grainger County Board of Education decided that a new comprehensive high school was needed in the county, residents of Washburn and surrounding areas became concerned that the county might decide to close Washburn High School and instead bus their children across Clinch Mountain every day. Rutledge High School was severely over capacity with more than 800 students, while Washburn High School had only some 200 students in grades 9 through 12. As of 2006, this situation was still unresolved. Construction on the new Grainger High School, with a planned capacity of 1600 students, began in 2006 and was scheduled for completion in 2008. About 1,000 students currently attend Grainger High School.http://www.lewisgroup.net/portfolio/portfolio_detail.html?portfolio_id=38 In July 2015, Washburn and Grainger County received international attention and social media backlash after a hardware store owner in the community placed a ‚ÄòNo gays allowed‚Äô sign on the door of his business after the ruling of Obergefell v. Hodges by the Supreme Court of the United States. Geography While many smaller communities exist in the area, such as Joppa, Powder Springs, Tater Valley, Liberty Hill, and Thorn Hill, Washburn is considered to be the central town of northern Grainger County, due to its access to most county services. Economy Commercial and public services include a bank, post office, storage center, school, library, a Dollar General store and a medical clinic, as well as several private businesses. Education Washburn is home to the only operating public school in northern Grainger County. The Washburn School complex is a pre-kindergarten through 12th grade school.

A c. 1882 engraving of Old South Church in Boston. The Pilgrim Monument in Provincetown, Massachusetts. Charles Amos Cummings (June 26, 1833 - August 11, 1905)Maine, Vital Records, 1670-1907, Death Record was a nineteenth-century American architect and architectural historian who worked primarily in the Venetian Gothic style. Cummings followed the precepts of British cultural theorist and architectural critic John Ruskin (1819-1900). Cummings help to found The Boston Society of Architects in 1867. Biography Born in Boston, Cummings was educated in the Boston Public Schools. Cummings graduated from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. Returning to Boston, Cummings joined the office of architect Gridley Bryant, where he met Willard T. Sears. In 1861 the two left Bryant's office to form their own architectural studio, Cummings and Sears. Cummings traveled extensively in Europe, primarily Italy. Travel, and writing about Italian architecture informed his own work, and while a part of the larger Gothic Revival style, Cummings and his partner Sears were not rigorous academic revivalists. Two early projects of the firm, Brechin Hall built in 1861, and Stone Chapel built in 1867 both at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts brought positive notice, and increased commissions to the firm. The office designed the massive brick Boston Cyclorama built to exhibit a large cyclical mural The Battle of Gettysburg, today it houses the Boston Center for the Arts. Just down the block from the Cyclorama building, the firm designed the Tremont Livery Stable at 439 Tremont Street. In 1872 the firm designed a large Stick Style residence at 121 Commonwealth Avenue in Boston's Back Bay, and the smaller but significant Pratt House in Forest Hills, also in the Stick Style. Following Boston's Great Fire of 1872, the firm was enlisted in the reconstruction of many downtown buildings. A significant part of Cummings and Sears practice focused on ecclesiastical architecture, building churches throughout Massachusetts and northern New England. In 1874 Cummings was commissioned to design what is considered his masterwork, a new building for the third oldest congregation in America, Old South Church in Boston located in Boston's Copley Square. Also completed in the same year was the Bedford Block which is an example of Venetian Gothic architecture. Cummings continued to work, almost until his own death in 1911. His last major commission was the design of the Pilgrim Monument in Provincetown, Massachusetts. The monument took the form of a 220' tower, built as an Italian campanile specifically modeled after the Torre del Mangia in Siena, Italy. The monument's cornerstone was dedicated in 1907 by Theodore Roosevelt and the completed building dedicated in 1910 by William Howard Taft. Cummings collected a vast number of medieval sculptures, and on his death bequeathed the collection to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, also funding the Charles Amos Cummings Bequest Fund for the collection and care of ancient sculpture for the museum. Publishing Cummings wrote several treatises on Italian architecture. In 1901 he published his largest work A history of architecture in Italy from the time of Constantine to the dawn of the renaissance with over 500 illustrations. In the same year, with Russell Sturgis, he published the Dictionary of Architecture and Building, which became a standard architectural text book. Notes References *Aldrich, Megan. Gothic Revival.

Biography He began studying Talmud as a boy. When he was ten years old, Zvi Hirsch Karo, the author of Neta' Sha'ashu'im, chose him as a son-in-law. At the age of twenty, he became the rabbi at Yazlovets. In the Jewish Encyclopedia, Louis Ginzberg and A. Pelginsky dramatically recount his encounter with Hasidism: :The chief event of his life was the struggle awakened in him by the opposition between the Talmud and the Cabala. Unacquainted with the tendencies and modes of life of the Hasidim, Buczacz did not believe in the miracles of their rabbis; and his wife and friends had great difficulty in persuading him to take his sick son to a Hasidic rabbi, Levi Isaac of Berdychev. The latter, however, influenced him to take up the study of the Cabala; but in trying to reconcile these new views--so utterly antagonistic to those of the extreme Talmudists, which he himself had hitherto held--he nearly became insane. The Hasidic rabbi Levi Isaac of Berdychev helped him through this struggle and won him over, to the great joy of the Hasidim, who feared his wide Talmudic learning. Buczacz adopted the Hasidic mode of living; but in his decision of halakic questions was guided, not by kabalistic, but by purely Talmudic, principles. In 1813 he succeeded his late father-in-law as rabbi of Buchach, and remained in office until his death.

AVFRD is a part of the Loudoun County Fire and Rescue Department, a combination volunteer/career department in Loudoun County, Virginia. AVFRD provides fire suppression, rescue and emergency medical services (EMS) to their constituents.  History  In early 1944, in a small farming community, 3 children left alone in a tenant's home located on the property of Thelma & Albert Hoffenberth were playing with matches. This home was located on Rt. 607 just around the corner from Charles & William Fletcher. A fire in the house broke out, and, despite the efforts of neighbors from surrounding farms, the 3 children, who had crawled under a bed to hide, perished. Then on February 14, 1944, the Ashburn School caught fire. It was at this time that concerned members of the community gathered to discuss the establishment of a volunteer fire company. By the end of 1944 the foundation for the Ashburn Volunteer Fire & Rescue Department was laid. On March 12, 1945, 16 members of the community gathered at the Calvary Baptist Church for the first officially chartered meeting of the Ashburn Volunteer Fire & Rescue Company. Each founding member paid a membership due of $1.00. Nelson Partlow was elected to serve as the first Fire Chief. J.R. Downs was elected the first President, Charles S. Monroe was the first elected Secretary and Baptist Minister, Reverend G.E. Hughes, who conceived the idea to organize the company, was elected to serve as the first Treasurer. It was at this meeting that the groundwork was set for the future Ashburn Volunteer Fire Department. In attendance were R.E Darnes, Lester Green, Charles Monroe, J.R. Downs, W. J. Hay, Nelson Partlow, Carley Fletcher, Charlie Fletcher, Wm. E. Fletcher, Julian Fouche, The Rev. G.E. Hughes, Ernest Monday, Preston Rollins, H.R. Tillett, and David L. Tucker. Of the 16 men, 2 are still living today. Julian Fouche now 100, resides in Winchester, VA, and past President Preston Rollins 83 years young resides in Florida. Preston Rollins served as President for the company for a total of 4 years and served on the board of directors for several years. On April 23, 1945, the paperwork was completed for the recording and Certificate of Incorporation of the Ashburn Volunteer Fire Department. Within 6 months, the membership had grown from 16 members to 37 members. The first year members consisted of the following individuals: Samuel Adrian, William Fletcher, Charles R. Fletcher, C.C. Kirkpatrick, H.R. Rutherford, Charles Alban, Julian Fouche, John E. Kirkpatrick, W.J. Rutherford, O.J. Boone, W.V. German, Charles S. Monroe, Frank L. Sheffield, John G. Gaylor, Lester Green, Ernest L. Monday, Edward Soloman, William L. Costello, William J. Hay, Nelson Partlow, C.R. Tillett, H.E. Daniels, John Hanes, Calvin Partlow, H.R. Tillett, R.E. Darnes, Albert E. Hofferberth, Lucas Phillips, David L. Tucker, Carlie J. Flether, J.R. Kerns, C.R. Robey and Herbert Wortman Even though the Ashburn Volunteer Fire & Rescue Department was not officially recognized as an organization until 1945, Ashburn has been serving the community since 1944. Since there was no firehouse to meet at, the members met in several locations, including the basement of the Calvary Baptist Church, the Masonic Lodge Hall and the School House. In late September 1945, the Ashburn Volunteer Fire & Rescue Department held its first carnival and for many years thereafter, the carnival came to Ashburn annually. The carnival would arrive on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday and stay for a week. The carnival was located at the baseball field behind the old Ashburn Elementary School on Partlow Road. On November 27, 1945, the members purchased their first fire truck, a 1929 open cab American-LaFrance pumper for a cost of $3,225.00 According to Billy Costello, ‚Äúthe LaFrance wasn‚Äôt much, but it worked.‚Äù The truck was kept in a variety of places throughout the community. In good weather it was kept in Mr. Partlow's shed and in bad weather, it was kept in Charlie Fletcher's cow barn. According to Charlie ‚Äúthe cows generated enough heat to keep the fire truck from freezing up.‚Äù Of the 60 years that Charles R. Fletcher served with the Ashburn Volunteer Fire Department he served as Assistant Chief in 1976, as President for a total of 7 years and served as Captain until the late 1990s. By the end of 1945 the company had raised a total of $4,342,41. This money was raised from membership dues, contributions, a meat sale, and their first carnival. Their expenses that year including the cost of the 1929 American-LaFrance were $3,558.85. During the first years most of the donations received, cash or otherwise, were made by the members themselves. In 1946, the company began taking applications for membership and by the end of 1946 they had 58 members. The majority of these members were 25 years of age or younger. The company first began keeping records of their calls in 1946. During that year they recorded ‚Äú11‚Äù fire calls. If a call went out the Partlow's would close the store, the Fletchers‚Äô would stop milking cows, others would stop bailing hay, it didn't matter what they were doing, members would stop whatever it was and go to help their neighbor. Not only did they run fire calls they also ran other types of calls, such as pumping water from cellars, pumping water from drains, rescuing farm animals, etc. During one call they used a piece of fire hose to rescue a horse from a well. Up until 1989 the members kept a running log of the yearly fire calls by writing the numbers on a chalkboard which was located in the old bays at the fire house. By 1988 the call volume had gone from 11 fire calls a year to 605 calls a year. Each year as the Ashburn area continued to grow the number of calls continued to increase. Today the Ashburn Volunteer Fire & Rescue Department runs over 4,500 Fire & EMS calls a year. In the early years the fire department installed a phone on the house of Frances and William Costello. It was up the Billy or his wife Frances to take the calls and then run over the Partlow's store to sound the alarm. Later on a wire was run from the Partlow's store to Mr. Costello's house and a button was connected to the house do the Costello's could sound the alarm from their home, Mr. Costello, said that ‚ÄúUntil the county helped the companies get radios you never knew for sure what you had, or who would be at the scene when you arrived.‚Äù Not only did Ashburn Volunteer Fire Department run fire calls in the Ashburn area, they were also called on many occasions to assist the Leesburg Fire Department and the Herndon Fire Department. Billy served as Captain when the company first formed and by 1948 he was elected Chief, a position he was re-elected to for the next 16 years. Of the 60 years that Billy Costello served with the company, he served as Chief for a total of 20 years. On October 16, 1946, the firehouse lot was purchased for $350.00, and the firefighters began construction on the two-story firehouse, $50.00 of the lot fee was returned to the company as a donation. The building was completed in 1947. Money used to help pay for the construction was raised from an area of 15 to 20 miles around the town. The building materials were purchased from local merchants and the construction of the building was done mainly by the members. The Ashburn Volunteer Fire Department raised money through carnivals, car raffles, meat sales, turkey shoots, bingo parties, auctions, barn dances, horse shows donations and membership dues. The carnival was one of Ashburn's biggest fund raisers. At that time, they received very little money from the county. The county paid the company based on mileage, $1.00 a mile. At that time the members were averaging about 75 miles per year. Other than the mileage payment, no other payments were received from the county. Members did not receive any compensation for their efforts and each member purchased his own uniform. Not only did members have to buy their own uniforms, members also donated cash and other items such as calves, pigs, and even a peacock as prizes for their fundraisers. In December 1948, the company had a Christmas party for the children in the community. Several days after the party, it was discovered that some of the children in the community had been left out, so the members made contributions to buy candy and delivered it to those children. In 1947, Gertrude (Gertie) Fletcher was deputized as a firefighter of the company by the then Chief. According to Gertie, ‚ÄúChief Carlie Fletcher arrived at the station one day for a call and no one else was there, so he called for her to come out to get on the piece, she tried to explain to him the she was not a firefighter, but he said to her, ‚ÄúI deputize you as a firefighter and if I deputize you than you‚Äôre a firefighter and you have to go, go get up here in the truck‚Äù ‚Äúand she did.‚Äù Although she did not run any calls and was not an actual member of the fire department, she was still considered by the members to be Ashburn's first female firefighter. In 1947, the company purchased their first car to raffle for a cost of $1,504.02. They were able to collect $2,967.75 from the raffle tickets making them a profit of $1,463.73. It is believed this was won by an Ashburn/Broad Run resident Larry Cockrell. In 1951 two vehicles were raffled off, a car and a truck. On February 16, 1948, the Ladies Auxiliary was formed. The officers elected to the Ladies Auxiliary were Thelma Hoffenberth ‚Äì President, Mrs. William Rutherford ‚Äì Vice President, Mrs. Redman ‚Äì Treasurer, and Mrs. H.J. Omera ‚Äì Secretary. The men would inform the ladies of what items they needed and the ladies would help to raise the money. By the end of 1948, the ladies had raised funds as a result of a rummage sale, food sales, flower sales, ice cream festivals, a Stanley party, refreshments sold at movies, a box supper, a cake walk and their monthly penny march. In case you are wondering what a penny march is, at every meeting each member would contribute a penny to the collection thus being called the penny march. By March 15, 1949, the Ladies Auxiliary had raised enough money through their fundraisers to donate $1,000.00 to the Fire Department to help pay for the new fire truck. In late 1948, the Ashburn Volunteer Fire Company agreed to have 12 street lights installed in the town of Ashburn. The annual electrical cost for these lights was estimated to be approximately $240.00. The county agreed to pay 2/3rds of the electrical cost. The remaining 1/3 was paid by the residents of Ashburn. Each year members and residents would contribute anywhere from $2.00 to $5.00 to the streetlight fund. In August, 1948 they purchased a new 1948 GMC Pumper for $7,283.06 and in 1955 they purchased an International Pumper for $14,289.45. Both pieces of equipment, fully modernized, represented an outlay of about $22,000.00. A portion of the money used to pay for the 1948 GMC was donated by the members. The company retired the 1929 American La-France in 1955. In 1948, the company held its first dance, the dances were held in the Poland's barn but were later moved to the Ruitan Club. Dances for the teenagers were held in the upper level of the fire house. In 1949, the company raffled a television that they purchased for $195.00. They collected $896.50, making them a profit of $701.50. On February 7, 1949, the by-laws were changed to include Chief and Assistant Chief on the board of directors. On February 11, 1949, Ashburn held its first oyster supper. This tradition continued until 2002. Also in 1949, the company held its first turkey shoot. In the early 1950s Melvin Partlow took over the duties of the Treasurer and maintained this position until the mid 1970s. He would also run the Partlow store alone if past life member Calvin Partlow was out on a call for a long period of time. During the 61 years that Melvin has served with the Ashburn Volunteer Fire & Rescue Department he served as President for 1 year, Secretary for 1 year and Treasurer for approximately 20 years. In 1959, William (Billy) L. Costello, Robert (Bobby) T. Howser & Sunny C. Flynn were sent to fire school in Williamsburg, Virginia, for a week-long training class. Up until then, Loudoun County had no organized training. So in late 1959 the first fire training school, initiated by Billy Costello was started. Billy Costello not only organized the training for the firefighters, he also helped in the design of many of the first pieces of fire apparatus. The Central alarm system was established in 1960, In August 1961, this system was tied in with the Fairfax County alarm system, thus enabling Ashburn to provide more adequate service to lower Loudoun County and provide additional help to upper Fairfax County. As of October 3, 1961 the Ashburn Volunteer Fire Department had 55 members, its building and equipment was debt free and there was a little nest egg to start its expansion program. Ashburn's slogan back then was ‚ÄúYou call ‚Äì We come.‚Äù By this time they had a trophy case filled with awards, for being the best appearing and having the best-equipped apparatus. In 1962 the company purchased a 1952 Dodge Power Wagon. In 1963 the department added an addition to the existing structure and they were seeing a need for a 4wheel drive brush truck. In 1964 Warren Rowland and Richard (Dick) Ramaley, Sr. joined the Fire Department. Shortly thereafter Dick became Chief Engineer and Warren became the Electrician. Both individuals have served with the department for 43 years. In 1967 the department placed in service a 1967 International truck. This was the last red fire truck ever purchased by the Ashburn Volunteer Fire Department. All apparatus purchased thereafter was the now current colors of yellow & white. According to Bobby Howser his most memorable experience was in 1968 when a call went out for a fire in the barns at the old Belmont Plantation. He said all the barns were connected and they knew that in one of those buildings a large amount of ammunition, shells, black powder and machine guns was being stored, but no one knew for sure which barn it was. Fortunately, they were able to put out the fire before it reached the location of the ammunition, which was just one stall away. Of the 54 years Robert Howser has served with the department he served as Chief in 1968 and as President for a total of 5 years. In 1969 as soon as Charles T (Tommy) Fletcher, turned 18, he like many others at that age, joined the department. Back then it was like a right of passage, you turned 18 and you joined the fire department. Of the 38 years that he has served with the department he held the position of either Secretary or Treasurer from the mid-1970s to the late 1980s. In 1970, Dave Thompson joined the department. Not only did he donate numerous hours as a firefighter, he also worked closely with Dick Ramaley, Sr. in keeping the vehicles and the building maintained. During Dave's 37 years of service, he served as Captain, Assistant Chief in 1975 and was the elected electrician for many years. In 1971, the then Chief, Walton B. Eamich, Sr. was instrumental in the start of a Junior Fire Department for young men 15 through 17 years of age. Prior to the establishment of the Junior Fire Department, anyone entering the department had to be at least 18 years of age. The first group of Junior members included David Breeden, Bruce Eamich, Jon (Jack) Harding, Jeff Roach, Jack Rooney and John Simpson. In order to be a junior member they were required to abide by the companies bylaws and maintain passing grades in their school work. Their progress was monitored closely by members of the company. If a fire broke out in the Ashburn area during school hours these young men were allowed to leave the classroom to assist. Throughout their 36 years of service, both Bruce and Jack, have served in the capacity of 1st Chief for a total of 12 years. During his reign as Chief, he organized monthly training drills, thus vastly improving the training and safety within the department. He strongly believed in teaching the members to ‚ÄúREMEMBER THE BASICS‚Äù. He was also instrumental the upgrading gear. In 2003 Walt was presented with the Fire Service Hall of Fame Award for his involvement with the Fire-Rescue Association and in training programs. In 1975, the first group of members interested in becoming emergency medical technicians set out to become certified. This group included Danny Corder who is now a career Captain in Loudoun County. Ricky Kehr, and Richard Ramaley, Jr. The second group included Melvin Byrne and Floyd Simpson. Of the 33 years that Melvin has served with the Ashburn Volunteer Fire Department, he served as Chief for a total of 6 years and as President for a total of 7 years. He is currently the department's Deputy Chief. Of the 47 years Floyd Simpson has served with the Department, he served as President for a total of 3 years. In 190 the company purchased a 1980 Hahn. This vehicle is still in the possession of the Ashburn Volunteer Fire & Rescue Department today. It is currently used as a ceremonial fire engine. This fire engine has transported many of the good men and women of the department including Firefighter/President Calvin Partlow, Chief Allen Polin, Chief Ray Muth, Sr., Chief Billy Costello, Chaplain Debbie Myers and Firefighter/Vice President Stewart Weller. In 1986 the County points system went into effect. At that time all active members were given 1 year of credit for 2 years served prior to 1986. From 1987 to present, active members are now given 1 year credit for each year served. In 1989, Anne Marie Mason was the first female to join the fire department and soon became Ashburn's first official female firefighter. In 1990, she was awarded the Lifesaving Medal for having cleared the airway of her neighbor's 20 month-old child. Of the 18 years that Anne Marie has served with the Ashburn Volunteer Fire & Rescue Department, she served as President for a total of 4 years and Vice President for a total of 4 years. In 1989 Kenneth Lawson recognized that the company was in need of additional help during the day. He was instrumental in getting staffing from the county to help the volunteers cover the daytime hours. Of the 36 years Ken has served with the department he served as Chief for a total of 7 years. He has served on the board of directors for numerous years and is currently serving as 1st Captain. As Ashburn began to grow in the early 1990s past life member Ray Muth, Sr., was instrumental in approaching the builders in the community and implementing the proffer system. As a result of this, the company was able to purchase more equipment and expand the station. Of the 36 years that Ray served with the Ashburn Volunteer Fire & Rescue Department, he served as chief for a total of 10 years and as President for a total of 10 years. Ray was also inducted into the Fire Service Hall of Fame. In 1992 Ashburn received its first ambulance, a 1992 Ford F350. The first medics to staff the ambulance came from Sterling, these individuals were Tim Callahan, Robin Davis and Robert Burk. The first Ashburn Rescue Officers were Don Kilpatrick & Tim Callahan. In 1993 another expansion to the building was completed. Most of the plumbing was done by life member Bill Groot and most of the tile work throughout this building was donated by life member, Stewart Weller, who passed away in February 2007. Of the 37 years that Stewart served with the Ashburn Volunteer Fire Department, he served approximately 20 years on the board of directors. During his time he also served as Vice President. Bill Groot has served with the department for 40 years. He served as Fire Marshal in 1969. In 1995, the company changed its name from the Ashburn Volunteer Fire Company to the Ashburn Volunteer Fire & Rescue Department. In 2005, the Ashburn Volunteer Fire & Rescue Department opened the doors to its second station, Moorefield Station 23. At this time there are plans being made to build another station in the Ashburn area. Around 2010 the Lansdowne Safety Center was opened as Station 22. The Moorefield Station was taken over by the county 24/7 and AVFRD took on Station 22 as its second volunteer station in Ashburn. In 2014 the original station 6 was razed and construction began on the new Station 6. ‚ÄúThe Tent‚Äù was put up to house apparatus and two trailers rented for sleeping quarters and offices. The grand opening of the NEW Station 6 to the public took place on May 15, 2016.  Stations  Ashburn Volunteer Fire and Rescue Department staffs two stations.  Station 6  AVFRD Station 6 is located on Ashburn Road in Ashburn, VA. The station was originally built in 1946. The land and the building are wholly owned by the volunteer fire company. In 2014 the original station was demolished and a new station constructed on the same land.  Station 22  The Lansdowne Public Safety Station 22 is owned by Loudoun County. County career personnel staff the station from 6:00 am ‚Äì 6:00 pm. Ashburn Volunteer personnel staff the station from 6:00PM ‚Äì 6:00AM. A LCFR safety officer (Safety 600) is on-duty at Station 22 on a 24/7 basis.  Apparatus  In 2017, the department took delivery of a new Tiller equipped with a 100-foot mid-mount aerial ladder and hydraulic extrication tools, and is in the process of replacing its old engines with new models. As of November 2017, stations 6 and 22 each have 2 new engines, designated E606, E606B, E622, and E622B.  Staffing  AVFRD staffs stations 6 and 22 from 6 pm to 6 am each night, and LCFR staffs the stations from 6 am to 6 pm.

(named after Alexius Meinong), is a theory in logic and metaphysics first coined by Richard Routley in 1980 and appropriated again in 2005 by Graham Priest. Overview Noneism holds that some things do not exist. That is, we can quantify over non-existent objects (\\"items\\") using the so-called particular quantifier (also known‚Äîmisleadingly in the view of noneists‚Äîas the existential quantifier). They also hold that \\"there is\\" is like \\"exist\\", rather than like the particular quantifier. Thus, they deny that there are things that do not exist. On this theory, there are no empty names, wherefore the \\"problem of empty names\\" that afflicts many theories about names (in particular, Millianism), is not a problem at all. While Priest also espouses dialetheism, he maintains that his dialetheism is mostly capable of being separated out from his noneism. The connection is that impossible objects may exist in impossible worlds, much as nonexistent objects may exist in possible (but not actual) worlds.

Woodbury returned to Java in 1860 and during most of that year travelled with Page through Central and West Java along with Walter's brother, Henry James Woodbury (born 1836 ‚Äì died 1873), who had arrived in Batavia in April 1859. On 18 March 1861 Woodbury & Page moved to new premises, also in Batavia, and the studio was renamed Photographisch Atelier van Walter Woodbury, also known as Atelier Woodbury. The firm sold portraits, views of Java, stereographs, cameras, lenses, photographic chemicals and other photographic supplies. These premises continued to be used until 1908, when the firm was dissolved. In his career Woodbury produced topographic, ethnographic and especially portrait photographs. He photographed in Australia, Java, Sumatra, Borneo and London.Edwards, Gary. International Guide to Nineteenth-Century Photographers and Their Works (Boston: G.K. Hall, 1988), 581‚Äì582. Although individual photographers were rarely identified on Woodbury & Page photographs, between 1861 and 1862 Walter B. Woodbury occasionally stamped the mounts of his photographs: \\"Photographed by Walter Woodbury, Java\\". Return to England and further endeavours In late January or early February 1863, Woodbury left Java to return to England, because of ill health.Ovenden, Richard. John Thomson (1837‚Äì1921): Photographer (Edinburgh: National Library of Scotland, The Stationery Office, 1997), 35‚Äì36, 216. Having returned to England, Woodbury invented the Woodburytype photomechanical reproduction process, which he patented in 1864.Rosenblum, Naomi. A World History of Photography (New York: Abbeville Press, 1984), 34, 197‚Äì198. Between 1864 and 1885 Woodbury took out more than 30 patents in Britain and abroad for inventions relating to balloon photography, transparencies, sensitised films and improvements in optical lanterns and stereoscopy. In addition to his inventions, Woodbury produced photographs documenting London's poor. In 1865 his Woodburytype process was bought by the Photo Relief Company, then bought by the Woodbury Permanent Photographic Printing Company and then bought by a succession of other companies in Britain and elsewhere. Death and memorial Walter B. Woodbury died on 5 September 1885 while on holiday in Margate, England. He was buried at Abney Park Cemetery in Stoke Newington, close to London, where his family memorial stands to this day. References Notes *  Further reading  *Elliott, Alan F.

After a bloody four-hour siege the small and isolated French garrison at Villafranca surrendered to Spanish regulars under Brigadier Jos√© de Mendiz√°bal and General Pedro Caro, 3rd Marquis of la Romana. Background In 1809 Spanish military operations in northern Spain were marked by sporadic efforts to expel Marshal Ney's French VI Corps from the provinces it had overrun following the collapse of the Spanish armies the previous year. Fragments of the armies torn-apart by the French, operating in conjunction with some 30,000 guerrillas and militia, prowled the coasts of Galicia and Asturias, raiding and skirmishing with Ney's 17,000 troops. Garrisoning the hostile region ate up most of Ney's resources, and in March 1809, the French evacuated Vigo and Tuy and withdrew from guerrilla-infested southern Galicia.Gates, p. 146 One remaining Spanish formation, General Pedro Caro, 3rd Marquis of la Romana's division of regular infantry, established itself in Asturias and harassed the French in Le√≥n and Galicia, capturing Imperial troops and supplies with impunity. In March, elements of the unit, armed with a French 12-pound gun and munitions recovered from an abandoned post at Ponferrada, struck at French communications with Madrid by attacking the French post at Villafranca. The battle The vanguard of the attack was formed of some 1,500 men of the Zaragoza and Zamora regiments under Mendiz√°bal. On the 17 March they entered the plaza at Villafranca and closed in on the French entrenched in the castle. A costly battle broke out that claimed the lives of several Spanish officers. After four hours of fighting the French agreed to surrender. One authority credited General La Romana with 3,800 Spanish troops and six artillery pieces. This force included two battalions each of the Princesa and Asturias Infantry Regiments. The 1,200-man French force included one battalion of the 6th Light Infantry Regiment plus several hundred sick and wounded soldiers. The French lost 700 killed and wounded plus another 574 unwounded men captured. Spanish losses are not known.Smith (1998), p. 282 A second historian wrote that the Spanish had 6,000 men.

History Grupo Man√≠a released its debut album in 1993. The group was formed by brothers H√©ctor and Oscar Serrano together with Edwin Serrano and Alfred Cotto in the early 1990s. In 1994, Edwin Serrano was replaced by Elvis Crespo before releasing their most successful albums. In 1997, Crespo decided to leave the group and follow a solo career. He was replaced in 1998 with Reynaldo Santiago, who had previously sung with Zona Roja, another popular merengue band at the time. The band has achieved gold status with some of their albums and are considered one of the best in the genre. At the beginning of the millennium, the band faced some controversy when H√©ctor ‚ÄúBanchy‚Äù Serrano, the group leader, fired Cotto and Santiago on the grounds of alleged discipline problems. Cotto and Santiago would go on to form Grupo Stars, while Serrano replaced them with Alex Rivera and Juan Luis Guzm√°n. Despite never having the same amount of success as previous years, the band continued to perform and record albums. However, in 2006, Serrano announced the group would go on a reunion tour entitled \\"The Originals\\" with former members, Elvis Crespo and Alfred Cotto. After three years of inactivity, Grupo Mania released 15 A√±os de Corazon in late 2008. The group continued releasing new and compilation albums, including: Se Peg√≥ La Man√≠a (2009), a live-recorded album Lo Que Le Gusta A Mi Gente (2011) and the band's 20th anniversary collection album Poderoso (2013). The latter was the last album to include performances by former members Oscar Serrano and Alfred Cotto. In 2015, Oscar Serrano announced that he would leave the group to pursue a solo career. The decision caused a lot of controversy, since Serrano had been with the group since its beginning in 1992, and he had been considered the \\"heart and soul\\" of Grupo Mania. Grupo Mania released the single \\"Te Vi\\", which only featured Banchy Serrano and Alfred Cotto as the only two remaining members of the group. The single received good criticism, since many fans thought the band seems to be getting back to what they have done before that made them successful. Later, Cotto, another original member (who had left the group years before and returned later), announced that he would also leave the group to pursue a solo career. Cotto stated that his decision to leave the group was based on agreements that the group's owner, Banchy Serrano, didn't comply with. As the leader of the group, Banchy Serrano continued to recruit talent for Grupo Mania. In 2016, new members Rubiel Omar Barroso, Daniel Serrano (Banchy's brother) and Jhonny V√©lez became the new voices of Grupo Mania alongside Banchy. The group released singles \\"Nena\\" and \\"Esc√°pate\\" alongside former member Elvis Crespo as a way to promote the new era of the group. Later in November, the band released their 15th studio album La Marca, which included singles \\"Otro Loco\\", \\"Te Vi\\" (a different version from the original one that featured Alfred Cotto) and \\"Esc√°pate\\". The album also featured the first time that neither Oscar Serrano or Alfred Cotto appeared on a Grupo Mania studio album. On January 4, 2018, former member Jhonny V√©lez announced on his Facebook page that he has been dismissed from the band. V√©lez stated that he received a phone call from the group's manager, Alexis V√°zquez, and the group's owner himself, Banchy Serrano, indicating him that they will no longer need his professional services. V√©lez also stated that he \\"doesn't know the reason yet\\" for his dismissal and that he always gave 200% of his effort, while also thanking Grupo Mania for giving him a chance to belong to their group and the fans for all the love shown. Later in January 2018, Grupo Mania announced the arrival of new member, Emanuelle Vizcarrondo to complete the four-men group after the dismissal of Jhonny V√©lez. Vizcarrondo has been part of successful merengue groups such as Los Sabrosos del Merengue and Grupo Mambo. The band was set to release their 16th studio album Los Conquistadores: 25 Aniversario on November 29, 2019. However, for unknown reasons, the album was not available in any digital platform, or at any store as a physical copy at the announced release date, despite the group's social media claim that is \\"available now\\". The group then announced on social media that they were having a \\"delay\\" because of the album's release date being on a Black Friday, and that they are expecting it to be available \\"at any time\\". Eventually, it was released on December 5, 2019 on digital platforms, such as Spotify and iTunes Store. The album includes recent successful singles, such as: \\"Toca√≠to\\", \\"El Animal\\", and \\"Chorro Eh Loco\\", which features Puerto Rican rapper √ëejo, and dominican singer Omega \\"El Fuerte\\". On July 16, 2020, Grupo Man√≠a released the official video of single \\"Get Low\\" on YouTube. The melody relies heavily on synthesizers and disco-like fusions, but without leaving behind the group‚Äôs merengue essence. Banchy describes the song as a ‚Äútrip back to the 70‚Äôs‚Äù, and ‚Äúsomething that gets us out of our comfort zone as a group‚Äù. The song also appears to feature a sample of Flo Rida‚Äôs \\"Low\\" during the chorus. It was produced by Henry Jim√©nez. Discography * A Bombazo... S√≠!

It was released in June 1998, and rose to number 21 on the UK Singles Chart. The song's lyrics refer to an incident when Brown saw His former Stone Roses band- mate John Squire in a village in Hale, Greater Manchester, not long after the split of the band. According to this story, Brown waved to Squire, but Squire hid behind a newspaper and would not acknowledge him. Recording In an interview with Making Music in 1998, Brown spoke about the song: :It came from Mani sitting down with his portastudio and coming up with a bassline, but we only found out last week that Reni doesn't actually play on it - it's a breakbeat Mani sampled. I thought it was a sample Reni took from the studio that Mani played to, but it was actually a breakbeat. :I've got a big pillowcase of tapes at home of Roses live shows and rehearsals and stuff, and I was just going through them one day and I found this bassline and remembered it.

It combines elements of several genres such as war films, time travel and historical drama.  Plot  The film begins with high-level military leaders from both North and South Korea discussing the surrender of a North Korean 50 Mt nuclear warhead () in a secret underground development bunker near the DMZ. The warhead was secretly jointly-designed, but international pressure has forced North and South Korea to hand over the device and close the facility. North Korean officer Major Kang Min-gil (Kim Seung-woo), displeased with the conciliation of the Koreas, steals the warhead with the help of several of his loyal soldiers. The leaders of both sides dispatch a South Korean special forces platoon under the leadership of Major Park Jung-woo (Hwang Jung-min). The platoon intercepts the rebellious Kang and his squad by boat and begin a firefight. However, in the middle of the conflict, a comet travels dangerously close to Earth - and this causes a \\"time rift\\" linking the present with other points in the comet's 433-year cycle of close approaches to the Earth. Three modern Korean men from each side (and one female scientist, Dr. Kim Su-yeon (Gong Hyo-jin), kidnapped along with the warhead) unintentionally find themselves time traveling back from 2005 to 1572, and wind up in the middle of a skirmish between Joseon-era Koreans and Jurchen invaders. After some confusion, a grenade blast routs the Jurchens, and the soldiers immediately wind up with the nickname \\"Heavenly Soldiers\\" due to their 'magical' abilities. The modern Koreans also meet with a regional foreigner who turns out to be none other than the young version of Yi Sun-sin (Park Joong-hoon), the legendary admiral who later becomes instrumental in the defeat of the later Japanese invasion. However, this \\"General\\" Yi acts like nothing like either of the modern Korean histories illustrate him: he is a petty thief and ginseng smuggler who just failed his military Gwageo exam, and seeing no future for himself, has turned to crime in order to survive. Yi also stole and hid the group's small arms shortly after their arrival. Unfortunately, a little peasant girl caught him burying the weapons and later retrieves one of the handguns, whereupon she is caught by two Jurchen spies sent to look for the \\"Heavenly Soldiers\\". With nothing better to do other than try to fix history, Major Park attempts to train Yi in the military skills he was so known for, while Major Kang and his men search the area for the nuclear device, which has gone missing during their transit. Not understanding their motivations, Yi is highly resistant to the modern Koreans' attempt to change his lowly lifestyle until he ends up captured by the Jurchens, who are aware of his association with the \\"Heavenly Soldiers\\" and attempt to make him lead them to the Koreans by killing the peasant girl. The North Koreans stumble upon Yi and free him, and also find the warhead in the tent of one of the war leaders. However, Kang is forced to kill the son of a war leader sleeping in the same tent, and in retaliation the Jurchens initiate movement to violently root out the modern Koreans. With the warhead back in their possession, and the timing and location of the comet's overhead passing accurately calculated by Dr. Kim, the \\"Heavenly Soldiers\\" prepare to leave the past as it currently stands. Yi, incensed by the barbarians' cruelty, returns to the modern Koreans with their weapons and the elders of the girl's village, who plead with the \\"Heavenly Soldiers\\" to help them, and the modern Koreans relent. When Majors Park and Kang debate over the strategy that would work best for the villagers, Yi, beginning to find his legendary tactical competence, successfully argues for a combination of ambushes and a last stand. That night, before the arrival of the Jurchens, the modern Koreans prepare to leave the past, as the comet would unexpectedly perigee later the next day. When Park advises Yi to save his life as well, Yi protests but is knocked out and carried off. Kang, who knows he will be hunted down as soon as he returns to the present, elects to go back to the village to help defend it from the Jurchens; the other modern Koreans stay behind for their own reasons as well. Meanwhile, the stubborn Yi manages to escape his confinement and joins the \\"Heavenly Soldiers\\" and the villagers in their battle against the Jurchens. The invaders are defeated after a long and bloody engagement, but out of the modern soldiers only Park and North Korean sergeant Choi survive alongside Yi. Dr. Kim and the warhead make it back to the present, where she reports their experiences to the Korean generals. But despite her appeals to honor the sacrifice the men have made to preserve Korea's present and future, her superiors decide to turn over the warhead. In the final scene, Dr. Kim visits a local memorial to the still- venerated Admiral Yi. The scene switches to the opening sequence of the Battle of Myeongnyang Strait, the legendary sea battle where Yi and only 13 Korean ships successfully destroyed an over 300-strong Japanese armada. Aboard his flagship, Yi, alluding to the Chinese proverb \\"in life there is death, in death there is life,\\" gives the order to charge into battle, with Park and Choi by his side as his staff officers.

Its theme - where North and South Koreans are forced into alliance under the leadership of a hero venerated in both parts of contemporary Korea - is clearly intended as a plea for Korean reunification.

Watergate According to Caddy, he met Hunt at a public relations firm then became friends due to shared political views. He served as national director for Young Americans for Freedom and had volunteered for the Committee to Re-elect the President. Caddy said that he also provided routine legal work for Hunt. Around 3 a.m. on the morning of June 17, 1972, Caddy stated that Hunt called him from an office in the Old Executive Office Building and said that they needed to talk. The two men met at Caddy's house where Hunt's predicament became evident. Caddy never spoke in court for Hunt, Liddy, or the five burglars. Inexperienced in criminal law, he enlisted the help of a criminal attorney to represent the five burglars. Liddy also retained Caddy's services on Hunt's advice. Citing Attorney‚Äìclient privilege, Caddy refused to divulge to government investigators who arranged legal counsel for the burglars. Eleven days after the burglaries, Judge John Sirica of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia subpoenaed him to testify before a grand jury. Refusing to do so, he was found in contempt of court. Caddy alleged that judges and prosecutors attempted to manipulate him because he was gay. An appeals court eventually upheld his right to refuse to testify. Caddy was portrayed by the character \\"Markham\\" in the 1976 film All the President's Men.

He is also the franchise holder for A1 Team Germany.A1GP : News Weber made himself a name in the motorsport world for discovering and promoting talents like the Schumacher brothers and for being a shrewd negotiator. Besides taking care of his clients' contractual issues he was also successful at making profitable merchandising deals for his clients. Before driver management As a teenager Weber trained his negotiating skills buying up worn military uniforms and selling those off to collectors. At the same time he was in an apprenticeship in hotel management in order to learn the business with the target to run his own gastronomic establishment. He succeeded as an entrepreneur with his businesses being based near Stuttgart, Germany, and became a wealthy man with franchises. As a motorsport fan he spent time and good part of his wealth behind the steering wheels of race cars. In 1983 engineer Klaus Trella talked Weber into a partnership and they founded their Formula 3 team WTS (Weber-Trella Stuttgart). Realising that he wasn't a front- runner on the track, Weber made room for ambitious youngsters, and enjoyed his status as team owner. The first success came in 1988 with talented Swabian driver Joachim Winkelhock who won the team's first German F3 Championship title. Talent scout and manager During a Formula Ford race at the Salzburgring in Austria later that year Weber, on the search for his next top driver as Winkelhock moved on to Formula One, spotted a young man who was racing for the first time in that category and comfortably won the race. It was the teenage Michael Schumacher from Kerpen. Weber invited Schumacher to test his F3 car in Hockenheim and became convinced this young man would go far. It was Weber's sole credit that Schumacher would be able to continue his career as his humble origins would not have allowed to come up with the funds for a season in the German F3 Championship. And, in his second season in the series, Schumacher duly won the title which propelled his career further. It was also thanks to connections of a close friend of Weber's to motorsport returnee Mercedes-Benz that Schumacher ended up in their Junior Team in Group C racing and later had the financial guarantees to back his Grand Prix debut in Spa in 1991 for Jordan Grand Prix. Michael Schumacher winning the Formula One World Championship in 1994 transformed Germany into a motor racing mad nation. The following was enormous and therefore the business opportunities arising meant a heavy workload. When the first ever German F1 World Champion successfully defended his title in 1995, Weber decided to focus all of his time on F1 and sold his F3 outfit. Weber has since been responsible, thanks to his shrewd negotiation skills, for Michael Schumacher turning into one of the highest earning sport stars ever. And, given his 15% commission for every deal he finalised for his clients, made him an even wealthier man. Schumacher won a further five titles in the 21st century. On the day before Schumacher agreed to be a temporary replacement for Felipe Massa for Ferrari in 2009, Weber famously told the Daily Mail newspaper that he was \\"200 per cent sure\\" that Schumacher would not replace the Brazilian.

In technical terms, the process is a photomechanical rather than a photographic one, because sensitivity to light plays no role in the actual printing. The process produces very high quality continuous tone images in monochrome, with surfaces that show a slight relief effect. Essentially, a Woodburytype is a mold produced copy of an original photographic negative with a tonal range similar to a Carbon print. The process was introduced by the English photographer Walter B. Woodbury and was in use during the final third of the 19th century, most commonly for illustrating fine books with photographic portraits. It was ultimately displaced by halftone processes that produced prints of lower quality but were much cheaper. Process A dichromate-sensitized sheet of gelatin is exposed to UV-rich light through a photographic negative, causing each area of the gelatin to harden to a depth proportional to the amount of exposure. It is then soaked in warm water to dissolve the unhardened portion of the gelatin. The resulting relief image is pressed into a thick sheet of lead under about 5000 pounds per square inch of pressure. This creates an intaglio metal printing plate, which is used as a mold. It is filled with liquid pigmented gelatin and a sheet of paper is then pressed down onto it, squeezing out the excess gelatin and attaching the remainder to the paper. After the gelatin has set sufficiently, the print is stripped from the mold, trimmed, and usually mounted onto a larger sheet or card. History The Woodburytype process was invented by Walter B. Woodbury and patented in 1864.Ovenden, 216; Rosenblum, 198; Bloom, 30. Auer and Auer give the date of its invention as 1866. It was the first successful photomechanical process fully able to reproduce the delicate continuous tone of photographs. It produced true middle values and did not make use of a screen or other image deconstruction method. It was often considered the most perfect, most beautiful photomechanical process and inspired a number of books, magazines, and special edition printings between 1864 and 1910. When attempts were made to adopt Woodburytype to rotary printing, the process could not compete with the quickly developing collotype and halftone photomechanical processes that almost completely replaced Woodburytype by the end of the nineteenth century. Like many practical inventions, the Woodburytype process was built on, or had features in common with, other inventions and discoveries. It utilized the photosensitivity of dichromated gelatin, discovered in 1852 by Henry Fox Talbot, who was thereby building on Mungo Ponton's 1839 contribution of potassium dichromate to the list of known sensitizing agents for making photographs on paper. The photochemical formation of the gelatin relief dates back to the first carbon printing patent of Alphonse Poitevin (1855). The idea of washing unhardened gelatin from the lower part of an exposed gelatin layer can be found in the early experiments of Adolphe Fargier (1861) and in the development of Joseph Swan‚Äôs fully practical carbon-transfer process (1864). Alois Auer, in his 1853 book on nature printing, describes making printing plates by forcibly impressing soft low-relief objects, such as leaves, into sheets of lead. The ancient Egyptians made molds and used them to mass-produce small ceramic goods. It is therefore not overly remarkable that some or all of the credit for the invention of ‚Äúphotorelief printing‚Äù was claimed by, or on behalf of, more than one inventor when the Woodburytype process was current, or that the matter can still generate heated debate among those inventors' present-day admirers. Regardless of the fact that many historical findings speak to Joseph Swan‚Äôs priority of original ideas of the photorelief process introduced under the name photo- mezzotint, it was Woodbury who advanced his research ideas into a fully workable and practical method of photomechanical printing of continuous-tone photographs. Woodbury‚Äôs patents in England, France, Belgium, and the United States, as well as production of several Woodburytype process printing establishments in England, France, and the US, were responsible for the printing of hundreds of thousands of Woodburytype photographs that provided book and magazine illustrations, short-run advertisement material, and promotional material. A number of Woodburytype images were also printed for sale as individual images or as cartes-de-visite (CDV) or cabinet cards (CC). Woodbury himself and a number of other researchers continued to improve various practical aspects of the Woodburytype process. Several important variants of the Woodburytype process were also developed and used on a very limited scale. The Woodburytype process was a unique photomechanical process as it was the only practical fully continuous-tone photomechanical process ever invented. Woodburytype prints made using only carbon black or other stable inorganic pigments as imaging material are superbly stable from light fading. The stability of the gelatin binder might be compromised at higher temperatures and humidity due to biological deterioration. A number of Woodburytype prints were surface coated using collodion or other organic varnishes and coatings. The majority of Woodburytype prints are easy to identify because the process was clearly described in print in books and on many prints sold commercially. Those that are described as ‚Äúpermanent prints‚Äù or not described at all, however, can be difficult to identify correctly even when using highly sophisticated analytical methods.

Manders (February 3, 1895 - February 18, 1973) was Mayor of Anchorage, Alaska from 1945‚Äì1946 and a leading voice among opponents of Alaskan statehood. Biography John Edgar Manders was born February 3, 1895 in Denver, Colorado to Robert Francis Manders and Letha Clementine Barnes Manders. In 1914, he married Henrietta Bertolas. He attended the University of San Francisco and the San Francisco Law School, and was admitted to the California Bar in 1918. He practiced law in San Francisco until 1941, when he moved his practice to Anchorage, Alaska. In 1945, Manders was elected mayor of Anchorage. He resigned on March 18, 1946, several weeks before his term was complete, in protest of plans to weaken the mayor's office by transferring powers to the city council and to a newly created office of city manager. \\"I will not be a figurehead in office,\\" he told the press. \\"I'll not be a Charlie McCarthy for a bunch of Edgar Bergens.\\" City Council member Winfield Ervin Jr. was appointed to serve as mayor until the April 2 elections. Manders was a tax protester, refusing to pay Federal income tax. In the 1950s, he campaigned against statehood for the Territory of Alaska, earning himself the title of \\"Statehood Foe #1\\" from Life Magazine. Manders argued that statehood would increase the taxes of Alaskan citizens. In its place, he advocated commonwealth status for the territory. Manders became known as the \\"Lone Republican,\\" because much of the rest of Alaska's prospective congressional delegation was dominated by Democrats such as Ernest Gruening, Bob Bartlett, Bill Egan and Ralph Rivers. In 1958, after the U.S. Senate voted to admit Alaska as the 49th state, he told Time Magazine: \\"Did you ever see anybody stop a crowd on its way to a hanging? Wait till the honeymoon is over and the taxes arrive ...\\" In the ensuing special election, he made a bid for one of the new seats in the Senate, but failed to gain the nomination of the Republican Party. Manders was a familiar sight in downtown Anchorage, where he was often seen walking with a cane and smoking a cigar. He belonged to the Freemasons and the Shriners. He died the morning of February 18, 1973 at Anchorage Community Hospital.

He became the leader of the department of liquid propellent rocket engines in NII-3 beginning in January 1938. Starting with Glushko's engines (ORM-65 and RD-1), he began a series of important engineering transformations, moving the fuel injectors to a head at one end of a cylindrical chamber, typical of modern design. The RDA-150, RDA-300 used nitric acid as an oxidizer, RDK-150 used liquid oxygen. The 1100 kgf thrust engine, D-1-A-1100 was developed for the rocket-powered interceptor BI-1. It was also regeneratively cooled, using the kerosine to cool the chamber, and the nitric acid to cool the nozzle.

The show is performed every Tuesday through Sunday from June through August. It was written by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Paul Green and conceived of as an idea by Margaret Pease Harper. The show is family-friendly and described as a \\"musical romance of Texas panhandle history\\". The plot is set against an authentic tapestry of history and the show's fictional characters bring to life the stories, struggles, and triumphs of the settlers of the Texas Panhandle in the 1800s. Plot The musical drama is about ranchers and farmers in the early days of Texas' settlement in the 1880s.Green, Paul. Texas. New York: Samuel French, Inc., publisher, 1966. .

The major themes of the play are love, romance, and people's struggle against the environment. The story's protagonist is Calvin Armstrong, a young homesteader from the East who seeks to make a living as a farmer in the Texas Panhandle. Armstrong has a dramatic romantic affair with Elsie McClain, who is the niece of Colonel Henry. Henry, a character most likely based on rancher, Charles Goodnight, is buying land and fencing it off for his cattle. McClain contributes to the conflict between Henry and Armstrong. The play covers events such as droughts and fear of losing one's land. It ends happily, and \\"the appropriate couples get married\\". Later versions of the show have been changed by directors, with each change vetted by Green or later, his literary executor. Some of the show's highlights include special fire and water effects. History The idea for Texas was born in July of at a dinner where Margaret Pease Harper and her husband Ples discussed issues relating to the Palo Duro Canyon with William and Margaret Moore. Both couples wanted to find a way to attract tourists to the canyon and also provide jobs during the summer. All four also wanted to find a way to teach the history of the region in a way that would be exciting. Harper had read an article in Reader's Digest about playwright and author Paul Eliot Green. Green had recreated the histories of several regions of America in what he called \\"symphonic dramas\\", featuring pageantry and music. Harper began corresponding with Green about the land, people, and beauty of Palo Duro Canyon. Green replied within a week, stating he was interested in the project and wanted to meet. In 1961, Harper and a group of Canyon, Texas families brought Green to their city and he was intrigued by the place and began writing the musical. The music, dancing, choreography, and direction of the production came from various departments of nearby West Texas State College (now West Texas A&M; University). Texas first opened at its permanent home in the Pioneer Auditorium on July 1, 1966. In 2003, a new script, titled Texas Legacies, premiered in 2003 and ran through the show's 40th anniversary in 2005. The new show, written by Lynn Hart, was meant to be more historically accurate and focused on different eras of Texas history each year. Texas Legacies did not prove to be a successful change, and in 2006, the original Texas returned to the Pioneer Amphitheater by popular demand. Texas Panhandle Heritage Foundation The show is produced by Texas Panhandle Heritage Foundation, a not-for-profit organization. It was founded by Margaret Pease Harper on May 7, 1961. and Along with Harper, the first board of directors included Pete Cowart, Jerry LaGrone, Dorothy Nebelett, Raymond Raillard, William A. Moore, and Avent Lair. In July, they discussed their initial purpose, which was to \\"recapture, recreate, and preserve the history of the Texas Panhandle by the presentation of a symphonic drama in a permanent theater in the Palo Duro Canyon of Texas.\\" In September 1961, the organization incorporated legally and the group came to represent 40 West Texas counties. The first project of the group was to build an amphitheater in Palo Duro Canyon, which would have as a backdrop a 600-foot cliff. The theater, named Pioneer Amphitheater, was eventually built with 1,600 seats. 2013 tragedy Five members of the Texas cast died in an automobile accident north of Amarillo shortly before midnight on August 12, 2013, while returning from a cast party held south of Dumas. The August 13 performance was cancelled in light of the deaths.

The stadium was inaugurated in 1926, with a match between the City of Dortmund and FC Wacker M√ºnchen (1-11).http://www.martijnmureau.nl/index.php/voetbal/vergane- glorie/368-vergane-glorie-stadion-rote-erde Extensive history and pictures of the stadium Rote Erde History  Early History (1921 to 1937)  The first plans for the stadium date back to 1921, when the Municipality of Dortmund decided to build a Volkspark in the southern area of Dortmund. Architect Hans Strobel designed the park, in which a swimming pool, a multi- functional stadium and the Westfalenhallen would be built. The stadium was built between 1924 and 1926 and was inaugurated in 1926. On September 4, 1927, the Katholikentag was held in the stadium and in the adjacent Westfalenhallen. This event was organized by the Papal Nuncio to Germany, Eugenio Pacelli, who would later become Pope Pius XII. In the first decade of the stadium's history, it was mostly used for athletic events. The first official football match in the stadium was in 1929, the quarter-final match of the 1929 German football championship between Borussia Dortmund's rivals Schalke 04 and Hertha BSC, with Hertha BSC winning 4-1. In 1932, the stadium hosted the Deutschen Jugendkraft Sportverband championship match between DJK Sparta Nuremberg and DJK Adler Frintrop, which ended 5-2 to Nuremberg.  Home Stadium of Borussia Dortmund (1937 to 1974)  Due to the German war machine, the steel and mining company Hoesch AG had to extend her factories in Dortmund. Borussia Dortmund was forced to leave their ground Weisse Wiese and moved to the Stadion Rote Erde in 1937. During World War II, the stadium was heavily damaged and was renovated after the war. From 1947 to 1967, Borussia Dortmund was one of the most successful clubs in West Germany and the stadium couldn't bear the number of visitors anymore. In 1961, plans were made to expand the stadium, or to build a new stadium on the same location of Stadion Rote Erde. However, due to the economic crisis, the plans were never put in motion. In 1962, the stadium was expanded by temporary wooden stands, increasing the stadium's capacity to 42,000. In 1971, the Municipality of Dortmund agreed to build a new stadium, directly west of the Stadion Rote Erde. Upon completion of the new Westfalenstadion in 1974, Borussia Dortmund moved into the new stadium. The wooden structure of the grandstand and roof of the stadium were transported to Hannover after the inauguration of the Westfalenstadion. The roof is installed at the Rudolf-Kalweit-Stadion of SV Arminia Hannover and the grandstand is at Oststadtstadion of OSV Hannover . However, the grandstand at Oststadtstadion was severely damaged by fire in March 2010.HAZ (22.

Among them was the Legendary Europe championship bout between Heinz Neuhaus and Hein ten Hoff on 20 July 1952, which ended in a first-round victory for Neuhaus. In 1990, the Stadion Rote Erde hosted the Deutsches Turnfest (German Gymnastics Festival).

Biography Early life Henry William Ravenel was born on May 19, 1814 on the Pooshee Plantation in Berkeley County, South Carolina. The plantation had been in his family since before 1716. It now lies beneath the waters of Lake Moultrie, which was created in 1939. The nearest existing place is Bonneau.Pooshee Plantation - Lake Moultrie, Berkeley County, South Carolina SC He attended the nearby Pineville Academy and graduated in 1832 from South Carolina College, now the University of South Carolina, where he was a member of the Clariosophic Society. Career He inherited the Pooshee Plantation from his father, and was a slave owner. He was also a regular diarist, and recorded his beliefs that former slaves should be regulated. He wrote in September 1865 \\"There must ... be stringent laws to control the negroes, & require them to fulfill their contracts of labor on the farm.\\" He made a critical study of the phaenogams (phanerogams?) of South Carolina, was botanist of the government commission to Texas in 1869 and was agricultural editor of the Weekly News and Courier. The genus Ravenelia of the Uredineae is named in his honor. He was credited with being the only American after the Rev. Moses A. Curtis, who knew specifically the fungi of the United States. The University of North Carolina gave him the degree of LL.D. in 1886. Death He died on July 17, 1887 in Aiken, South Carolina.

CaMKII is involved in many signaling cascades and is thought to be an important mediator of learning and memory. CaMKII is also necessary for homeostasis and reuptake in cardiomyocytes, chloride transport in epithelia, positive T-cell selection, and CD8 T-cell activation. Misregulation of CaMKII is linked to Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, Angelman syndrome, and heart arrhythmia. Types There are two types of CaM kinase: * Specialized CaM kinases, such as the myosin light chain kinase that phosphorylates myosin, causing smooth muscles to contract * Multifunctional CaM kinases, also collectively called CaM kinase II, which play a role in neurotransmitter secretion, transcription factor regulation, and glycogen metabolism.

The isoforms derive from the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta genes. Structural domain All of the isoforms of CaMKII have: a catalytic domain, an autoinhibitory domain, a variable segment, and a self-association domain. The catalytic domain has several binding sites for ATP and other substrate anchor proteins. It is responsible for the transfer of phosphate from ATP to Ser or Thr residues in substrates. The autoinhibitory domain features a pseudosubstrate site, which binds to the catalytic domain and blocks its ability to phosphorylate proteins. The structural feature that governs this autoinhibition is the Threonine 286 residue. Phosphorylation of this site will permanently activate the CaMKII enzyme. Once the Threonine 286 residue has been phosphorylated, the inhibitory domain is blocked from the pseudosubstrate site. This effectively blocks autoinhibition, allowing for permanent activation of the CaMKII enzyme. This enables CamKII to be active, even in the absence of calcium and calmodulin. The other two domains in CaMKII are the variable and self-association domains. Differences in these domains contribute to the various CaMKII isoforms. The self-association domain (CaMKII AD) is found at the C terminus, the function of this domain is the assembly of the single proteins into large (8 to 14 subunits) multimers Calcium and calmodulin dependence The sensitivity of the CaMKII enzyme to calcium and calmodulin is governed by the variable and self-associative domains. This sensitivity level of CaMKII will also modulate the different states of activation for the enzyme. Initially, the enzyme is activated; however, autophosphorylation does not occur because there is not enough calcium or calmodulin present to bind to neighboring subunits. As greater amounts of calcium and calmodulin accumulate, autophosphorylation occurs leading to persistent activation of the CaMKII enzyme for a short period of time. However, the Threonine 286 residue eventually becomes dephosphorylated, leading to inactivation of CaMKII.Miller, S.G., and Kennedy, M.B. (1986). Regulation of brain type II Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase by autophosphorylation: a Ca2+-triggered molecular switch. Cell 44, 861-870. Autophosphorylation Autophosphorylation is the process in which a kinase attaches a phosphate group to itself. When CaMKII autophosphorylates, it becomes persistently active. Phosphorylation of the Threonine 286 site allows for the activation of the catalytic domain. Autophosphorylation is enhanced by the structure of the holoenzyme because it is present in two stacked rings. The close proximity of these adjacent rings increases the probability of phosphorylation of neighboring CaMKII enzymes, furthering autophosphorylation. A mechanism that promotes autophosphorylation features inhibition of the PP1 (protein phosphatase I). This enables CaMKII to be constantly active by increasing the likelihood of autophosphorylation. Long-term potentiation Calcium/ calmodulin dependent protein kinase II is also heavily implicated in long-term potentiation (LTP) ‚Äì the molecular process of strengthening active synapses that is thought to underlie the processes of memory. It is involved in many aspects of this process. LTP is initiated when the NMDA receptors are in a local environment with a voltage potential high enough to displace the positively-charged Mg2+ ion from the channel pore. As a result of the channel being unblocked, Ca2+ ions are able to enter into the postsynaptic neuron through the NMDA receptor channel. This Ca2+ influx activates CaMKII. It has been shown that there is an increase in CaMKII activity directly in the post synaptic density of dendrites after LTP induction, suggesting that activation is a direct result of stimulation. In LTP When alpha-CaMKII is knocked out in mice, LTP is reduced by 50%. This can be explained by the fact that beta-CaMKII is responsible for approximately 65% of CaMKII activity. LTP can be completely blocked if CaMKII is modified so that it cannot remain active. After LTP induction, CaMKII moves to the postsynaptic density (PSD). However, if the stimulation does not induce LTP, the translocation is quickly reversible. Binding to the PSD changes CaMKII so that it is less likely to become dephosphorylated. CaMKII transforms from a substrate for Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is responsible for dephosphorylating CaMKII, to that of Protein Phosphatase 1. Strack, S. (1997) demonstrated this phenomenon by chemically stimulating hippocampal slices. This experiment illustrates that CaMKII contributes to the enhancement of synaptic strength. Sanhueza et al. found that persistent activation of CaMKII is necessary for the maintenance of LTP. She induced LTP in hippocampal slices and experimentally applied an antagonist (CaMKIINtide) to prevent CaMKII from remaining active. The slices that were applied with CaMKIINtide showed a decrease in Normalized EPSP slope after the drug infusion, meaning that the induced LTP reversed itself. The Normalized EPSP slope remained constant in the control; CaMKII continues to be involved in the LTP maintenance process even after LTP establishment. CaMKII is activated by calcium/calmodulin, but it is maintained by autophosphorylation. CaMKII is activated by the NMDA-receptor-mediated Calcium elevation that occurs during LTP induction. Activation is accompanied by phosphorylation of both the alpha and beta-subunits and Thr286/287. Independent induction of LTP LTP can be induced by artificially injecting CaMKII. When CaMKII is infused in postsynaptically in the hippocampal slices and intracellular perfusion or viral expression, there is a two- to threefold increase in the response of the synapse to glutamate and other chemical signals. Mechanistic role in LTP There is strong evidence that after activation of CaMKII, CaMKII plays a role in the trafficking of AMPA receptors into the membrane and then the PSD of the dendrite. Movement of AMPA receptors increases postsynaptic response to presynaptic depolarization through strengthening the synapses. This produces LTP. Mechanistically, CaMKII phosphorylates AMPA receptors at the P2 serine 831 site. This increases channel conductance of GluA1 subunits of AMPA receptors, which allows AMPA receptors to be more sensitive than normal during LTP. Increased AMPA receptor sensitivity leads to increase synaptic strength. In addition to increasing the channel conductance of GluA1 subunits, CaMKII has also been shown to aid in the process of AMPA receptor exocytosis. Reserve AMPA receptors are embedded in endosomes within the cell. CaMKII can stimulate the endosomes to move to the outer membrane and activate the embedded AMPA receptors. Exocytosis of endosomes enlarges and increases the number of AMPA receptors in the synapse. The greater number of AMPA receptors increases the sensitivity of the synapse to presynaptic depolarization, and generates LTP. Maintenance of LTP Along with helping to establish LTP, CaMKII has been shown to be crucial in maintaining LTP. Its ability to autophosphorylate is thought to play an important role in this maintenance. Administration of certain CaMKII blockers has been shown not only to block LTP but also to reverse it in a time- dependent manner. Behavioral memory As LTP is thought to underline the processes of learning and memory, CaMKII is also crucial to memory formation. Behavioral studies involving genetically engineered mice have demonstrated the importance of CaMKII. Preventing autophosphorylation Deficit in spatial learning In 1998, Giese and colleagues studied knockout mice that have been genetically engineered to prevent CaMKII autophosphorylation. They observed that mice had trouble finding the hidden platform in the Morris water maze task. The Morris water maze task is often used to represent hippocampus- dependent spatial learning. The mice's inability to find the hidden platform implies deficits in spatial learning. However, these results were not entirely conclusive because memory formation deficit could also be associated with sensory motor impairment resulting from genetic alteration. Deficit in fear memories Irvine and colleagues in 2006 showed that preventing autophosphorylation of CaMKII cause mice to have impaired initial learning of fear conditioning. However, after repeated trials, the impaired mice exhibited similar fear memory formation as the control mice. CaMKII may play a role in rapid fear memory, but does not completely prevent fear memory in the long run. In 2004, Rodrigues and colleagues found that fear conditioning increased phosphorylated CaMKII in lateral amygdala synapses and dendritic spines, indicating that fear conditioning could be responsible for regulating and activating the kinase. They also discovered a drug, KN-62, that inhibited CaMKII and prevented acquisition of fear conditioning and LTP. Deficit in consolidation of memory traces Œ±-CaMKII heterozygous mice express half the normal protein level as the wild-type level. These mice showed normal memory storage in the hippocampus, but deficits in consolidation of memory in the cortex. Overexpression Mayford and colleagues engineered transgenic mice that express CaMKII with a point mutation of Thr-286 to aspartate, which mimics autophosphorylation and increases kinase activity. These mice failed to show LTP response to weak stimuli, and failed to perform hippocampus-dependent spatial learning that depended on visual or olfactory cues. Researchers speculate these results could be due to lack of stable hippocampal place cells in these animals. However, because genetic modifications might cause unintentional developmental changes, viral vector delivery allows the mice's genetic material to be modified at specific stages of development. It is possible with viral vector delivery to inject a specific gene of choice into a particular region of the brain in an already developed animal. Poulsen and colleagues in 2007 used this method to inject CaMKII into the hippocampus. They found that overexpression of CaMKII resulted in slight enhancement of acquisition of new memories. Addiction CaMKII has recently been implicated in the immortalization of the ŒîFosB protein in accumbal dopaminergic neurons, making it a large contributor to the stabilization of the addictive state. Different forms CaMK2A CaMKIIA is one of the major forms of CamKII. It has been found to play a critical role in sustaining activation of CamKII at the postsynaptic density. Studies have found that knockout mice without CaMKIIA demonstrate a low frequency of LTP. Additionally, these mice do not form persistent, stable place cells in the hippocampus. CaMK2B CaMK2B has an autophosphorylation site at Thr287. It functions as a targeting or docking module. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis identified at least five alternative splicing variants of beta CaMKII (beta, beta6, betae, beta'e, and beta7) in brain and two of them (beta6 and beta7) were first detected in any species. CaMK2D CaMK2D appears in both neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. It is characterized particularly in many tumor cells, such as a variety of pancreatic, leukemic, breast and other tumor cells. found that CaMK2D is downregulated in human tumor cells. CaMK2G CaMK2G has been shown to be a crucial extracellular signal-regulated kinase in differentiated smooth muscle cells.

Biography He was born in Ischia, the cousin of Francesco Ferdinando I d'√Åvalos, inheriting his titles after 1525, fighting the French and the Venetians by his side. During the period 1526-1528 he fought under Hugo of Moncada, being captured on 28 April 1528 by the Genoese captain Filippino Doria at the Capo d'Orso. In July 1535 he was part of the naval troops reconquering the city of Tunis in North Africa. The failure on the third war against France trying to invade Provence, and the death of the first Governor of the Duchy of Milan, Antonio de Leyva, prompted him in 1538 to accept the nomination as governor, replacing Marino Caracciolo, the second governor, becoming some sort of protector of literary and musical people . Wars with French and North Italians ended for a while with the Treaty of Crespy (1544). He also became a Knight in the Order of the Golden Fleece. Having fought at the Battle of Pavia, he later represented Emperor Charles V as an ambassador, in 1538, on the succession to the new Doge of the Republic of Venice, Pietro Lando. He commanded the Imperial army in Italy during the Italian War of 1542 and was defeated by the French at the Battle of Ceresole. However, in the Battle of Serravalle on 2 June 1544, an aftermath of the Italian War of 1542, he managed to defeat a force of freshly raised Italian mercenaries in French service, commanded by Pietro Strozzi and Giovanni Francesco Orsini, count of Pitigliano.

Full name Waaia Football Club |- ! Nickname The Bombers |- ! Strip Black jumper with red sash. |- ! Founded 1894 |- ! League Picola & District Football League South East |} The Waaia Football Club, nicknamed the Bombers, is an Australian Rules Football club playing in the Picola & District Football League. The club is based in the small Victorian town of Waaia, approximately 220 km from Melbourne. History Waaia Football Club can be said to have originated in 1894. Over the next couple of decades the club competed in a number of different leagues and associations. In 1935, the club commenced an involvement in the Picola and District competition that continues to this day. Waaia's first premiership was won in 1953. Its 1990 premiership is folklore in the district with Mick Cleeland's 50 m torpedo goal giving the Bombers a come-from-behind victory after the final siren had sounded. Footage of the event can be viewed at http://www.picturevictoria.vic.gov.au/countryfootball/Immortality.htm Chaos reigned following his goal as officials tried to unravel what had happened. The main issue being that the score board only showed the goals and behinds and not the total score...creating confusion as to who had won. Added to all this was irony of the goal kicker...Mick Cleeland. When then coach Mick Power took over the reins in 1988 he inherited a talented but undisciplined team that needed to learn team play. He immediately banned the use of the torpedo as it was selfish and inaccurate. Players who persisted in kicking 'torps' were benched. The most common culprit of the rule was Mick Cleeland. However, after the awards ceremony on the ground of the 1990 grand final win the team retreated to the change rooms to sing the club song whereupon Mick Power stopped everyone and yelled,\\" I love torpedoes!\\" The Bombers followed this thrill up in 1991 with an even better season where they were 1st XVIII premiers and champions as well as 2nd XVIII premiers. This was followed by the theft of the premiership cup during post game celebrations at the Waaia Hotel. The cup went missing for over a week making local and state news services. It was returned, undamaged, a fortnight later by one of the premiership players whose mates had taken it back to Melbourne as a memento of the trip. Whilst it was away the cup featured at a number of barbecues and other AFL grand final celebrations where attendees had their photo taken in the traditional styles of opposing captains shaking hands or premiership captain holding cup aloft. The 'stolen cup' story is now folklore in the town and each time the players who returned the cup visits the club he is reminded of the event.

He played four years of college basketball for Arizona State University before moving to Australia in 2004 to play professionally. After spending time in the SEABL and with the New Zealand Breakers, Redhage joined the Perth Wildcats in 2005 and went on to become one of the franchise's all-time great players. Throughout an illustrious career, Redhage cemented his status in NBL history with a number of accolades, having won four NBL titles (2010, 2014, 2016, 2017) while featuring in four All-NBL teams (2008, 2009, 2010, 2013) and winning the Gordon Ellis Medal as the Perth Wildcats most valuable player six times‚Äîtied with Ricky Grace for most by a player in the team's history. He also captained the team from 2009 to 2013. Known as \\"The Scoring Machine\\", Redhage spent his early years in the NBL as a force on the interior before becoming known for his knockdown ability from deep as his career progressed. High school career Redhage was born in Jacksonville, Florida but grew up in Lincoln, Nebraska. He attended Lincoln East High School, where he played for the school's basketball team in each of his four years. He averaged 22.1 points and nine rebounds in 1997‚Äì98 and 21.0 points and 9.4 rebounds in 1998‚Äì99. He led the team to a 19‚Äì3 record in senior season (1998‚Äì99) and was subsequently named Nebraska Player of the Year (honorary captain) and Class A first-team all-state by the Omaha World-Herald. He ended his career as the school's career leader for rebounds (554), assists (315) and blocks (235), while finishing second in points with 1,206. He also became the second Lincoln East player (after Alex Stivrins in 1979‚Äì80) to make the Omaha World-Herald All-Nebraska first-team as a junior and senior. Redhage was also an accomplished prep soccer player, as he led his team to the state championship and was a three-year letterwinner. College career Redhage moved to Arizona State for college, where he joined the Sun Devils for the 1999‚Äì2000 season. As a freshman, he posted double-digits 14 times and matched the ASU freshman record with 28 starts. On 20 November 1999, he had a season- best 17 points against Texas en route to Puerto Rico Shootout All-Tournament honors. In 32 games, he averaged 8.3 points, 3.7 rebounds and 2.0 assists per game. As a sophomore in 2000‚Äì01, Redhage established himself as one of the top student-athletes at Arizona State and in the Pac-10 as he earned Pac-10 All- Academic selection. In the Sun Devils' season opener, Redhage scored 19 points against Tulsa. On 30 December 2000, he had a season-best game with 19 points and 12 rebounds against Charlotte. He appeared in 29 games for the Sun Devils while making 24 starts, and averaged 8.1 points, 4.2 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game. As a junior in 2001‚Äì02, Redhage was a Pac-10 All-Academic pick for the second straight year. On 2 February 2002, he had a season-high 13 points against California. Redhage came off the bench in all 29 games he played in 2001‚Äì02, averaging career-low numbers of 5.2 points, 2.6 rebounds and 1.2 assists per game. As a senior in 2002‚Äì03, Redhage was a Pac-10 All-Academic pick for the third straight year. On 8 February 2003, he had a career-best performance off the bench against Washington. He had a career-high 29 points on 8-of-11 from the floor, had career highs in free throws made (11) and attempted (18), and posted season highs in rebounds (eight), assists (five) and minutes (34) in ASU's 79‚Äì77 overtime win. His 29 points marked the most by a Sun Devil off the bench in school history. Five days later against USC, he had 16 points and a career high-tying 12 rebounds for the second double-double of his career. Redhage finished the season with 13 double-figure scoring games and earned 2003 Verizon Academic All-District VIII honors. In 32 games (seven starts), he averaged 8.3 points, 3.8 rebounds and 1.8 assists per game. Redhage concluded his college career with a 3.61 grade point average, and in December 2007, he finished his B.S. in construction (general building construction) and graduated magna cum laude. Professional career SEABL and New Zealand Breakers (2004‚Äì2005) After going undrafted in the 2003 NBA draft, Redhage moved to Australia and joined the NW Tasmania Thunder for the 2004 SEABL season. He won four player of the week awards on his way to claiming the league MVP honour. He helped the Thunder win the SEABL South Conference championship before winning through to the ABA National Final, where they were defeated 104‚Äì100 by the Cairns Marlins. In his rookie season, he averaged 35 points and 15 rebounds per game. He was subsequently signed by the New Zealand Breakers for the 2004‚Äì05 NBL season. He made an impressive start to the season and was one of the Breakers' stand-out performers in the early clashes. However, a form slump in November led to Redhage's court time being reduced and he was eventually released on 6 December 2004. In 13 games for the Breakers, he averaged 12.2 points, 4.6 rebounds and 1.4 assists per game. In 2005, Redhage returned to the SEABL, this time joining the Bendigo Braves. He helped the Braves win the SEABL South title before going on to lead them to the ABA National Championship. Redhage was named MVP of the conference grand final for his 43 points and 13 rebounds. He was also named SEABL South most valuable player for the second straight year. Perth Wildcats (2005‚Äì2017) Birth of \\"The Scoring Machine\\" (2005‚Äì2009) Following the 2005 SEABL season, Redhage moved west to join the Perth Wildcats in an attempt to revitalise his NBL career. Redhage made an immediate impact with the Wildcats as he set the tone for his impending career with a 27-point debut against the Adelaide 36ers on 2 September 2005. He went on to average 20 points and nine rebounds per game during the 2005‚Äì06 NBL season and subsequently finished second in the league's MVP voting while earning All-NBL Second Team honours. Redhage was a dominant force for the Wildcats over his first four seasons. He averaged at least 19 points and eight rebounds every year between 2005/06 and 2008/09 and subsequently earned a place in the All- NBL Team in four straight seasons. He was also a four-time Gordon Ellis Medalist during this time for being the Wildcats Club MVP. In 2007/08, he averaged a career-best 22.9 points per game and set his career high for points in a game with 40 on 10 October 2007 against the Adelaide 36ers. During that season, he became the fastest Wildcat to reach 2,000 career points, doing so in 95 games and 3,400 minutes. His scoring prowess over the early portion of his career earned him the nickname \\"The Scoring Machine\\". However, while his individual game was superb, Redhage was unable to lead the Wildcats to a grand final berth despite appearing in the playoffs in each of his first four seasons. Redhage was naturalised and became an Australian citizen on 12 January 2008. He subsequently played for Australia at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. First NBL Championship (2009‚Äì10) In September 2009, Redhage was appointed captain of the Perth Wildcats ahead of the 2009‚Äì10 NBL season, replacing Paul Rogers as skipper. With the inclusion of Kevin Lisch, Luke Schenscher and Jesse Wagstaff in 2009/10, combined with the league's decision to move to the 40-minute game format, Redhage's scoring average dropped by four points, but he still managed to lead the team with 15.1 per game. Behind Redhage, Lisch, Damian Martin and coach Rob Beveridge, the Wildcats won their recording-setting fifth NBL title in March 2010 with a 2‚Äì1 grand final series win over the Wollongong Hawks. Despite his drop in scoring, Redhage was named to the All-NBL First Team for the second time in his career (the first being in 2007/08) and earned his fifth straight Gordon Ellis Medal. Possible career-ending injury (2010‚Äì11) In April 2010, with the hopes of being part of a golden era at the Wildcats, Redhage re-signed with the team on a three- year deal. However, on 23 January 2011, his season came to an end after dislocating his left hip during the Wildcats' 77‚Äì76 loss to the Adelaide 36ers in Adelaide. It was originally feared that it could be a career-ending injury with there being a real possibility at the time of him requiring a hip replacement. The injury occurred after Redhage lunged for a contested ball in a way that punched the head of his femur through his pelvis, breaking the bone and dislocating the joint. For the first time since joining the Wildcats in 2005, Redhage was injured and out of action. The Wildcats lost four consecutive games after their skipper was whisked to the US for surgery, winning only two from the remaining eight. Despite missing the second half of the season, Redhage shared the Gordon Ellis Medal with Kevin Lisch for 2010/11. Return to action and grand final (2011‚Äì12) Redhage made a remarkable returned to the Wildcats' line-up for the start of the 2011‚Äì12 season, as he played in their season opener against the 36ers in Adelaide on 8 October 2011. In the arena where his horrific injury occurred nine months earlier, Redhage scored a game-high 26 points to lead the Wildcats to a 102‚Äì69 win. After just narrowly missing out on the opening round's Player of the Week award, Redhage went on to earn Player of the Week honours for Round 2 after recording 21 points, seven rebounds and four assists in a 92‚Äì76 win over the Melbourne Tigers on 14 October 2011. Redhage concluded the season by earning Player of the Week honours for Round 25 after scoring 19 points and adding seven rebounds, two steals, one assist and one blocked shot to help the Wildcats finish the regular season with a 72‚Äì71 road win over Melbourne. With a 19‚Äì9 record, the Wildcats entered the NBL Finals as the second seed. After defeating the Gold Coast Blaze 2‚Äì1 in the semi-finals, the Wildcats moved on to the NBL Grand Final series, where they faced the New Zealand Breakers. After losing to the Breakers in Game 1 in Auckland, the Wildcats looked down and out in Game 2 in Perth also. All looked lost for Perth in Game 2, who trailed the Breakers for much of the game, but the Wildcats snatched a thrilling one-point lead with less than a minute to play and held on to defeat the Breakers 87‚Äì86. Redhage forced the NBL Grand Final to a third and deciding game with a memorable final-second block on Breakers guard C. J. Bruton. However, the Wildcats went on to lose Game 3 back in Auckland, with the Breakers taking out a 79‚Äì73 victory despite a team-high 18 points from Redhage. Another grand final appearance (2012‚Äì13) After being named MVP of the NBL's preseason competition, Redhage went on to represent the South All-Stars in the NBL All-Star Game held in Adelaide on 22 December 2012. In January 2013, Redhage was joined in the co-captain position by Damian Martin after Brad Robbins, who had served as co-captain alongside Redhage for two and a half seasons, retired in December 2012. Later, on 4 February 2013, Redhage was named in the Perth Wildcats 30th Anniversary All-Star team. The 2012‚Äì13 NBL season saw the New Zealand Breakers (24‚Äì4) and the Perth Wildcats (22‚Äì6) dominate the competition, and as it would be, both teams returned to the grand final series to face off for the second straight year. However, this time, the Breakers swept the Wildcats to win the series 2‚Äì0. Second NBL Championship (2013‚Äì14) Redhage in April 2014, at the Wildcats' championship ceremony Following the 2012‚Äì13 season, coach Rob Beveridge and import Kevin Lisch both moved on after four stellar seasons with the Wildcats. Swingman Cameron Tovey also departed after announcing his retirement, leaving the Wildcats with their biggest turnover in players since before the Beveridge/Lish era. Despite a number of Redhage's long-time adversaries moving on, he re-committed to the Wildcats on 7 May 2013, re-signing with the team for three more seasons. Heading into the 2013‚Äì14 season, Redhage relinquished the captaincy to Damian Martin. The Wildcats were favourites to take out their sixth NBL title thanks to a solid roster which included new coach Trevor Gleeson and two new explosive and athletic imports in James Ennis and Jermaine Beal. Despite no longer being the potent \\"scoring machine\\" he once was, Redhage was still a solid contributor for the Wildcats in 2013/14, as he was the team's third leading scorer at 13.6 points per game behind Ennis (21.2) and Beal (15.6). The trio led the Wildcats to an 8‚Äì0 start, which resulted in a 21‚Äì7 record to conclude the regular season as minor premiers. After defeating the Wollongong Hawks 2‚Äì1 in the semi-finals, the Wildcats moved on to their third straight grand final series and fourth since 2010. There they faced their chief rival, the Adelaide 36ers. After two gruelling contests in Games 1 and 2, the Wildcats overpowered the 36ers in Game 3 in Perth, winning 93‚Äì59 to take out their sixth NBL championship. With Ennis in foul trouble during Game 3, Redhage played 34 minutes and scored a team-high 16 points to help claim his second NBL title. Entering the record books (2014‚Äì15) On 17 October 2014, in the second game of the 2014‚Äì15 season, Redhage scored 15 points against the Wollongong Hawks in his 300th NBL game. Later that year, on 18 December, Redhage played his 300th game as a Wildcat in a 78‚Äì74 loss to the Sydney Kings. He became just the sixth player to join the Wildcats' 300 Club, a club that includes Ricky Grace (482), James Crawford (371), Andrew Vlahov (349), Eric Watterson (306) and Mike Ellis (302). The Wildcats stumbled through the 2014‚Äì15 season, as they finished the regular season in fourth place with a 16‚Äì12 record and were eliminated in the semi-finals by the Cairns Taipans in a clean sweep. The team's finals campaign was not helped by the absence of Redhage, who was ruled out prior to Game 1 of their series against the Taipans with a stress fracture in his right foot. He was subsequently in a moonboot for roughly six weeks. The ever-resilient Redhage appeared in all 28 regular-season games for the Wildcats in 2014/15 but averaged a career-low 11.4 points per game. Third NBL Championship (2015‚Äì16) Coming into the 2015‚Äì16 season, Redhage took a back seat for the first time in his 10-year career as a Wildcat. With offseason-recruit Nathan Jawai allowing long-time starting centre Matthew Knight to shift to his natural position of power forward, Redhage was assigned the back-up small forward position. As a result, Redhage had a subdued season in 2015/16, as his career moved into a veteran mentor role. Redhage embraced the role change and helped steady a first-class second unit. On 25 January 2016, Redhage played his 350th NBL game. With Casey Prather missing the game due to hamstring tightness, Redhage stepped into the starting line-up and hit two three-pointers to help the Wildcats defeat the Cairns Taipans 84‚Äì74. With an 18‚Äì10 record, the Wildcats finished the regular season in second spot, booking themselves a place in the finals for a 30th straight season, a streak not matched in any other Australian or American professional sport code. The Wildcats went on to defeat the Illawarra Hawks 2‚Äì1 in the semi-finals and moved on to their 12th NBL Grand Final series, where they faced the New Zealand Breakers for a third time. The Wildcats took Game 1 in Perth but lost Game 2 in Auckland, leading to a deciding Game 3 in Perth where the Wildcats overpowered the Breakers to win 75‚Äì52. The series win saw the Wildcats claim their seventh NBL championship, while Redhage claimed his third title. Once again, Redhage competed in every contest for the Wildcats, but averaged under 10 points per game for the first time in his career. He finished with 6.6 points, 3.1 rebounds and 1.4 assists in 34 games. Rounding out career with a fourth championship (2016‚Äì17) Redhage shooting a free throw in his 372nd game for the Wildcats on 3 February 2017 Despite the prospect of bowing out on a high, Redhage revealed in July 2016 that he never seriously contemplated retirement following the 2015‚Äì16 season and always intended to push on into 2016/17. And so it was on 16 August 2016, Redhage re-signed with the Wildcats for the 2016‚Äì17 NBL season. In his 12th season as a Wildcat, Redhage took an even further reduced role than what he had in 2015/16. With the NBL's move to allow team's to have three imports and carry an 11-man roster in 2016/17, Redhage's playing time quickly dropped to under 10 minutes per game. On 14 October 2016, Redhage played his 350th game for the Wildcats in a 75‚Äì73 win over the team who gave him his first opportunity in the NBL, the New Zealand Breakers. He became just the third Wildcat to reach the 350-game mark, joining James Crawford (371) and Ricky Grace (482). Redhage (left) talking with Lachy Reid at the Wildcats' 2017 championship ceremony Despite his declarations in the offseason that he may continue to play past 2016/17, an impending retirement announcement was always on the cards for Redhage in the back-end of the 2016‚Äì17 season. Such speculation came to fruition on 30 January 2017 when Redhage, nine days after his 36th birthday, announced via a press conference at Bendat Basketball Centre that this season would be his last in the NBL. Four days later, on 3 February, Redhage made his 372nd appearance for the Wildcats, scoring six points off the bench in the team's 94‚Äì63 win over the Brisbane Bullets in Perth. With his 372nd game played as a Wildcat, he moved into second spot on the team's all-time games played list, placing him behind only Ricky Grace (482). On 10 February, in his final regular season game at Perth Arena, Redhage tied his season high with 11 points to help the Wildcats defeat the Sydney Kings 101‚Äì74; nine of his points came in the last five minutes of the game. The Wildcats went on to finish the regular season in third place with a 15‚Äì13 record, and after sweeping the Cairns Taipans in the semi-finals, they moved on to the NBL Grand Final for the sixth time in eight years. There the Wildcats swept the Illawarra Hawks 3‚Äì0 in the best-of-five series to claim their eighth NBL championship, while Redhage collected his fourth title to bow out of the NBL on a high. The Wildcats not only collected their eighth championship, but went back-to-back for the first time since 1990/1991. In the 95‚Äì86 title-clinching Game 3 win on 5 March 2017 at Perth Arena, Redhage started at power forward in his 393rd and final NBL game and finished the contest with three points. Despite his limited role in 2016/17, Redhage competed in every game for the Wildcats, averaging 2.7 points, 1.2 rebounds and 7.8 minutes in 33 games. Redhage finished his illustrious NBL career with 393 games to his name‚Äî380 with the Perth Wildcats (second on the team's all- time games-played list)‚Äîwhile finishing with 5,819 points and 2,153 rebounds. Puerto Rico and SBL Redhage has spent numerous offseasons in Puerto Rico playing for Criollos de Caguas (2008), Piratas de Quebradillas (2009, 2010 & 2013) and Capitanes de Arecibo (2014). In 2013, he and former Wildcats teammate Kevin Lisch helped Piratas de Quebradillas win the BSN championship. On 21 December 2016, Redhage signed with the Perth Redbacks of the State Basketball League for the 2017 season. Following the conclusion of 2016/17 NBL season, he joined the Redbacks for the start of their 2017 campaign. He made his SBL debut in their season opener on 17 March 2017, scoring a game-high 35 points in 28 minutes as a starter in a 102‚Äì77 win over the Rockingham Flames. On 13 April, he recorded 27 points and a season-high 18 rebounds in a 90‚Äì83 loss to the Joondalup Wolves. On 29 April, he scored a season-high 46 points in a 107‚Äì89 win over the Cockburn Cougars. He subsequently earned Player of the Week honours for Round 7. On 13 May, he scored 40 points against the Geraldton Buccaneers. In the 2017 SBL All-Star Game on 5 June, Redhage recorded 25 points and a game-high 11 rebounds in the North All-Stars' 129‚Äì126 overtime loss to the South All-Stars. In the Redbacks' regular-season finale on 29 July, Redhage scored a game-high 37 points in a 116‚Äì107 loss to the East Perth Eagles. He subsequently finished the regular season with a league-best 27.53 points per game, and earned Player of the Week honours for Round 20. Redhage helped guide the fourth-seeded Redbacks through the playoffs to reach the SBL Grand Final, where behind a 20-point effort from Redhage, the Redbacks defeated the Wolves 103‚Äì70 to win the championship. In 25 games for the Redbacks, Redhage averaged 25.8 points, 9.4 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game. During the season, he had nine 30-point games and two 40-point games. On 28 February 2018, Redhage re-signed with the Redbacks for the 2018 season. On 21 April, he scored a season-high 29 points in an 83‚Äì69 win over the Goldfields Giants. Four days later, he scored 28 points in a 113‚Äì82 win over the Mandurah Magic. He was subsequently named Player of the Week for Round 6. On 28 April, he recorded 19 points and a season-high 15 rebounds in an 87‚Äì83 loss to the Willetton Tigers. On 25 May, he recorded 23 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds in a 94‚Äì89 loss to the Stirling Senators. In the 2018 SBL All-Star Game on 4 June, Redhage scored 11 points in the North All-Stars' 123‚Äì110 win over the South All-Stars. The Redbacks finished the regular season in third place with a 19‚Äì7 record, before losing 2‚Äì1 to the Senators in the quarter- finals. In 26 games, Redhage averaged 19.8 points, 6.7 rebounds and 4.7 assists per game. On 8 May 2019, Redhage signed with the Perry Lakes Hawks for the rest of the 2019 SBL season. He fitted in seamlessly and began playing more centre than ever before in his career. On 7 June, he scored a season-high 29 points against the Lakeside Lightning. He helped the Hawks finish the regular season in fifth place with an 18‚Äì8 record, as they entered the finals having won seven of eight games. They went on to sweep the Rockingham Flames 2‚Äì0 in the quarter-finals before losing in a sweep to the Joondalup Wolves in the semi-finals, despite a 25-point effort from Redhage in game two. In 19 games, he averaged 15.4 points, 6.7 rebounds and 3.9 assists per game. Initially set to play for the Hawks again in 2020, Redhage was ruled out of the West Coast Classic due to a knee injury. Personal Redhage and his wife, Gretchen, have two children. Redhage is tertiary qualified in construction engineering and has spent time working for a financial planning firm called Savanna Pride in Subiaco, Perth. After retiring from the NBL, Redhage started his business Redhage Basketball, which revolves around coaching junior players.

It was commissioned by Dr. Pedro Domingo Curutchet, a surgeon, in 1948 and included a small medical office on the ground floor. The house consists of four main levels with a courtyard between the house and the clinic. The building faces the Paseo del Bosque park. The main facade incorporates a brise soleil. History Construction began in 1949 under the supervision of Amancio Williams and was completed in 1953.UNESCO: World Heritage Sites Tentative List, retrieved 20 October 2013 Design and construction The house exemplifies Le Corbusier's five points of architecture and incorporates a ramp and a spiral staircase. The house represents a landmark in Corbusier own trajectory because it exemplifies how cultural and historical characteristics of architecture (the elements of the traditional Argentine courtyard house) can be rewritten using Corbusier's five points of modern architecture. Dr. Curutchet's house is also one of the very few buildings that Corbusier built attached to pre-existing buildings and perfectly responding to a historical context. With this house Corbusier proved, more than with any of his other projects, that modern architecture could in fact be in a harmonious dialogue with traditional architecture. Inside the house, the marvellous architecture can be seen. There is a tree inside the house i.e. the care was taken while designing that the tree will retain and still not disturb the beauty of the house. The terrace, folding wooden curtains, inclinated stair design, wardrobes, kitchen are designed during 1949-1953 and are the same, which are used in present era as modern designs. Restoration The house was restored from 1986 to 1988 during the centennial of Le Corbusier's birth and declared a national landmark by Argentina's Commission on National Landmarks. It currently houses the Buenos Aires professional association of architects, the Colegio de Arquitectos, and is open to the public for tours. In July 2016, the house and sixteen other works by Le Corbusier were inscribed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. In popular media The 2009 film El hombre de al lado was shot in the house.

Anselm IV (also Anselm of Buis, Italian: Anselmo da Bovisio) was the Archbishop of Milan from 3 November 1097 to his death on 30 September 1101. He was a close friend of Pope Urban II and prominent in the Crusade of 1101, whose Lombard contingent he led and on which he died. According to Galvano Fiamma, he was born in Bovisio, the son of a valvassor. He entered the monastery of S. Lorenzo and was then elected, in 1097, bishop of Brescia. Milan was threatening to fall into a schism again when he was elected to bring peace. He had never, however, taken holy orders before his consecration on 3 November. Under were corrected the irregularities of the past decades at a synod held from 5 - 7 April 1098. He affirmed the excommunication of imperial-appointed bishops and condemned simony. He accepted the acts of Anselm III, but not those of Tedald. He was recruited by Pope Paschal II, Urban's successor, to lead the crusade being proclaimed in response to the success of the First Crusade. He preached the crusade throughout Lombardy, where there had been little enthusiasm for the first one, but where his influence sparked a wave of zeal: crowds greeted him chanting \\"Ultreja! Ultreja!\\" On 15 July 1100, he celebrated the anniversary of the fall of Jerusalem in Milan. He appointed one Grossolano, then bishop of Savona, to act as his vicar and, on 13 September, with bishops Guy of Tortona, William of Pavia, and probably Aldo of Piacenza, he left with a company reported at the exaggerated figure of 50,000 men, led by Albert, Count of Biandrate, and his nephew Otto Altaspata. Albert, Count of Parma, the brother of the Antipope Guibert, was there as a representative of the resolution of the church-state conflicts which enveloped Lombardy in the final decades of the eleventh century. The army proceeded by land through Carinthia, with the permission of Duke Henry V, and then through Bulgaria without incident, relying on Anselm's negotiations with Alexius I Comnenus, Byzantine emperor, to assure them of markets and supplies. At Constantinople, rioting broke out, but he and Albert quelled it with ease and he refused the rich gifts offered by the emperor, who ferried the soldiery across the Bosphorus. At Nicomedia, in Asia Minor, he met Raymond IV of Toulouse, one of the leading barons of the capture of Jerusalem. Guided by Raymond, the army marched through Anatolia, skirmishing with the Turks at Kastamonu and between Merzifon and Amasya. These initial confrontations were successes for the Lombards. Anselm fought in these engagements and received wounds which he went to Constantinople to nurse. There he died and was buried. News of his death did not reach Milan until 1102. He was succeeded by Grossolano. Sources *Landolfo Iuniore di San Paolo. Historia Mediolanensis. *Ghisalberti, Alberto M. Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani: III Ammirato - Arcoleo. Rome, 1961.

He began in 1959 at Doubleday, where he became an editor at Anchor Books, and the originating editor of Dolphin Books. He moved to Harper and Row where he started Perennial Books, then to New American Library to run Signet Classics and Mentor Books where he published Watson and Crick's \\"The Double Helix\\". Finally he joined St. Martin's Press and, eleven years after entering publishing, he was appointed the CEO. His maverick strategy ‚Äì which included publishing more fiction than any other house in America ‚Äì helped St. Martin's expand its annual billings from two-and-a-half-million dollars to over a quarter-billion. In the 1980s he had St. Martin's launch its own mass-market paperback line, the first hardcover house to do that since Simon and Schuster founded Pocket Books in 1939. Meantime he was editing bestsellers ranging from All Creatures Great and Small to The Silence of the Lambs. In the late 1990s, after aiding in the sale of St. Martin's to the Holtzbrinck Publishing Group of Germany, McCormack resigned his role as Chairman, CEO, and Editorial Director to pursue his interest in theater. For a year McCormack maintained a role in publishing by writing a regular column for Publishers Weekly, titled ‚ÄúThe Cheerful Skeptic‚Äù. It was a mixture of humor and protest as he examined and repudiated much of the book-industry's \\"conventional wisdom\\". He has been awarded the AAP's Curtis Benjamin Award for Creative Publishing, and the LMP's Lifetime Achievement Award. He has lectured on publishing at Princeton and Harvard. He is the author of Afterwords: Novelists on Their Novels and The Fiction Editor, the Novel, and the Novelist. Playwriting McCormack wrote his first play, a one-act, American Roulette, just as he joined St. Martin's. It gained him a place in the Albee-Barr Playwrights Unit. American Roulette has subsequently been staged in numerous regional theaters in the U.S. and Canada. Among the other young beginners with him in the Playwrights Unit were A.R. Gurney, Terrence McNally, Lanford Wilson, John Guare, and Sam Shepard. McCormack, however, with new family and job responsibilities, suspended his playwriting for over two decades. His first full-length play, Endpapers, was produced in New York in the 2002-2003 season. Its cumulative audience of over 40,000 put it among the three or four most popular Off Broadway plays of the first decade of this century. His two produced plays are published by The Dramatists Play Service. He has continued to write and post his new scripts online. For the last decade he has been a regular contributor to an online forum: Aesthetics-L: Art, Aesthetics, and Philosophy. Prompted by this, McCormack began again to think and write about current issues in academic philosophy; more specifically, problems in philosophy of language, mind and ontology. This led him to write a full-length play about a philosopher-in-exile, INCOMPLETENESS, AND THE REST. Most recently, he's written an offshoot of that play‚ÄîTHE ARGUMENT, \\"An Introduction to Philosophy of Language and Mind, in One Act\\", which he describes as \\"a precarious attempt to combine what seem to be two mutually-antagonistic things: Serious problems of 21st century philosophy - and \\"theatricality\\".' Personal life McCormack's wife, the former Sandra Danenberg, was a celebrated book editor of fiction. She died in 2013, eighteen years after manifesting the first symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease. Their two children, Daniel and Jessie, also went to Brown; they are both now screenwriters and directors in Hollywood. Following their graduation, McCormack gave the University money to build The McCormack Family Theater on campus. The development of DNA analysis allowed McCormack to have an unusual experience in his later years. He'd been adopted (birth-name, Michael Griffin). When he was over sixty years old, he met for the first time his full sister, and seven other half-siblings. They've been a part of his life ever since. He currently lives in New York City.

The first edition of the Canadian Electrical Code was published in 1927. Rick Gilmour (ed), Canadian Electrical Code Part 1, Safety Standard for Electrical Installations CSA Standard C22.1-06, Canadian Standards Association, Mississauga, Ontario 2006, The current (24th) edition was published in 2018. Code revisions are now scheduled on a three-year cycle. The Code is produced by a large body of volunteers from industry and various levels of government. The code uses a prescriptive model, outlining in detail the wiring methods that are acceptable. In the current edition, the Code recognizes that other methods can be used to assure safe installations, but these methods must be acceptable to the authority enforcing the Code in a particular jurisdiction. The Canadian Electrical Code serves as the basis for wiring regulations across Canada. Generally, legislation adopts the code by reference, usually with a schedule of changes that amend the code for local conditions. These amendments may be administrative in nature or may consist of technical content particular to the region. Since the Code is a copyrighted document produced by a private body, it may not be distributed without copyright permission from the Canadian Standards Association. The Code is divided into sections, each section is labeled with an even number and a title. Sections 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 26 include rules that apply to installations in general; the remaining sections are supplementary and deal with installation methods in specific locations or situations. Some examples of general sections include: grounding and bonding, protection and control, conductors, and definitions. Some examples of supplementary sections include: wet locations, hazardous locations, patient care areas, emergency systems, and temporary installations. When interpreting the requirements for a particular installation, rules found in supplementary sections of the code amend or supersede the rules in general sections of the code. The Canadian Electrical Code does not apply to vehicles, systems operated by an electrical or communications utility, railway systems, aircraft or ships; since these installations are already regulated by separate documents. The Canadian Electrical Code is published in several parts: Part I is the safety standard for electrical installations. Part II is a collection of individual standards for the evaluation of electrical equipment or installations. (Part I requires that electrical products be approved to a Part II standard) Part III is the safety standard for power distribution and transmission circuits. Part IV is set of objective-based standards that may be used in certain industrial or institutional installations. Part VI establishes standards for the inspection of electrical installation in residential buildings. Technical requirements of the Canadian Electrical Code are very similar to those of the U.S. National Electrical Code. Specific differences still exist and installations acceptable under one Code may not entirely comply with the other. Correlation of technical requirements between the two Codes is ongoing. Several CEC Part II electrical equipment standards have been harmonized with standards in the USA and Mexico through CANENA, The Council for the Harmonization of Electromechanical Standards of the Nations of the Americas (CANENA) is working to harmonize electrical codes in the western hemisphere. Objective based code In response to industry demand, CSA has developed Part IV of the Canadian Electrical Code, consisting of two standards CSA C22.4 No. 1 \\"Objective-based industrial electrical code\\" and CSA C22.4 No. 2 \\"Objective-based industrial electrical code - Safety management system requirements\\". These standards are intended for use only by authorized industrial users and would not apply, for example, to residential construction. These standards do not prescribe specific solutions for every case but instead give guidance to the user on achievement of the safety objectives of IEC 60364. Since it is less prescriptive, the OBIEC allows industrial users to use new technology not yet represented in the CEC Part II. Use of this OBIEC is restricted to industrial and institutional users who have a safety management program in place and the engineering resources to implement the regulations. It is intended that users of the OBIEC will maintain safety while using methods that will reduce the installation cost of large industrial plants, for example, in the petrochemical business.http://www.ebmag.com/index.php/Industry-News/Objective-based- industrial-electrical-code-receives-approval.html Objective-based industrial electrical code receives approval, Electrical Business, retrieved Jan 16, 2009http://www.obiec.org/PDF/Doc%20A%20Overview.pdf OBIEC working group overview References See also * National Electrical Code * IEEE C2 * PSE law, Japan Electrical Safety Law. * Slash rating * Central Electricity Authority Regulations Category:Electrical safety Category:Electrical wiring ","title":"Canadian Electrical Code"},{"id":"7202211","text":"Philip E. Rubin (born May 22, 1949) is an American cognitive scientist, technologist, and science administrator known for raising the visibility of behavioral and cognitive science and neuroscience at a national level. During his research career he was best known for his theoretical contributions and pioneering technological developments, starting in the 1970s, related to speech synthesis and speech production, including articulatory synthesis (computational modeling of the physiology and acoustics of speech production) and sinewave synthesis, and their use in studying complex temporal events, particularly understanding the biological bases of speech and language. He is the Chief Executive Officer emeritus and a member of the Board of Directors of Haskins Laboratories in New Haven, Connecticut, where he was also a senior scientist. In addition, he is a Professor Adjunct in the Department of Surgery, Otolaryngology at the Yale University School of Medicine, a Research Affiliate in the Department of Psychology at Yale University, a Fellow at Yale's Trumbull College, and a Trustee of the University of Connecticut. He is also President-Elect of the Federation of Associations in Behavioral and Brain Sciences (FABBS). From 2012 through Feb. 2015 he was the Principal Assistant Director for Science at the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) in the Executive Office of the President of the United States, and led the White House's neuroscience initiative. He also served as the Assistant Director for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences at OSTP. For many years he has been involved with issues of science advocacy, education, funding, and policy. Education Philip Rubin received his BA in psychology and linguistics in 1971 from Brandeis University and subsequently attended the University of Connecticut where he received his PhD in experimental psychology in 1975 under the tutelage of Michael Turvey, Ignatius Mattingly, Philip Lieberman, and Alvin Liberman. Career Philip Rubin's research spans a number of disciplines, combining computational, engineering, linguistic, physiological, and psychological approaches to study embodied cognition, most particularly the biological bases of speech and language. He is best known for his work on articulatory synthesis (computational modeling of the physiology and acoustics of speech production), speech perception, sinewave synthesis, signal processing, perceptual organization, and theoretical approaches and modeling of complex temporal events. At the same time, he has been involved in leadership roles related to science administration, policy, and advocacy. Speech Synthesis and Speech Production During his time at Haskins Laboratories, Rubin was responsible for the design of many software systems. Most prominent are SWS, the Haskins sinewave synthesis program and ASY, the Haskins articulatory synthesis program, both developed in the 1970s. SWS has been used by Robert Remez, Rubin, David B. Pisoni, and other colleagues and researchers to study the time-varying characteristics of the speech signal. In addition to use in standard articulatory synthesis, the ASY program has been used as part of a gestural-computational model that combines articulatory phonology, task dynamics, and articulatory synthesis. With Louis Goldstein and Mark Tiede, Rubin designed a radical revision of the articulatory synthesis model, known as CASY, the configurable articulatory synthesizer. This 3-dimensional model of the vocal tract permits researchers to replicate MRI images of actual speakers and has been used to study the relation between speech production and perception. He is also the designer of the HADES signal processing system and the SPIEL programming language. From 1992 through 2012, Rubin was the core and administrative leader of Haskins Laboratories' main research activity, the National Institutes of Health/NICHD funded P-01 program project, ‚ÄúThe Nature and Acquisition of the Speech Code and Reading.‚Äù In 1998, he was the co-founder and first President of AVISA, the Auditory-Visual Speech Association, now part of the International Speech Communication Association (ISCA). He is co-creator, with Eric Vatikiotis-Bateson, of the Talking Heads website. National Science Foundation From 2000-2003 Rubin was the Director of the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (BCS) at the National Science Foundation (NSF) in Arlington, Virginia, where he helped launch the Cognitive Neuroscience, Human Origins (HOMINID), Documenting Endangered Languages, and other programs, was part of the NBIC (Nanotechnology, Biotechnology, Information technology and Cognitive science) activities, and was the first chair of the Human and Social Dynamics priority area. Rubin returned to the NSF during the second term of the Obama Administration to serve as a Senior Advisor in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE). Science Policy and Advocacy Rubin has been in several leadership roles related to science policy and advocacy. From 2006-2011 he was the Chair of the National Academies Board on Behavioral, Cognitive, and Sensory Sciences; a member-at-large of the Board of the Federation of Associations in Behavioral and Brain Sciences (FABBS); and the co-leader of the Yale-Haskins Teagle Foundation Collegium on Student Learning. He is also the former Chairman of the Board of the Discovery Museum and Planetarium in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where he also worked with museum staff, trustees, city and state representatives, and others to establish the Discovery Magnet School on museum grounds, the first pre-K to 8 interdistrict public magnet school in the region with a science theme. He is currently the President-Elect and a member of the Board of Directors of FABBS. Ethical Issues Related to Research and Emerging Technologies While at the NSF during the Clinton and Bush administrations, Rubin was the NSF ex officio representative to the National Human Research Protection Advisory Committee (NHRPAC) and the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Human Research Protections (SACHRP), established to provide advice to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on issues related to the protection of human research subjects. He was also the co-chair of the inter-agency National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Committee on Science (COS) Human Subjects Research Subcommittee (HSRS) under the auspices of the President's Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and was also formerly the co-chair of the HSRS Behavioral Research Working Group. After leaving the NSF in 2003, he continued to be active on human subjects issues as they relate to public policy, including lecturing, writing, co-authoring an AAUP report, participating in activities of the Yale Bioethics Center, and serving on the advisory board of the Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics. Rubin has been a long-time member of the Yale University Technology and Ethics working group and Yale's Science, Technology, and Utopian Visions working group, hosted by the Whitney Humanities Center. He has also expressed concerns about the ethical and scientific oversight of the use of certain tools and techniques by the intelligence, law enforcement, military, and national security communities, considering some of them to be boondoggles. An example includes his serving as the Chair of the National Research Council (NRC) Committee on Field Evaluation of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences-Based Methods and Tools for Intelligence and Counter-Intelligence. In a workshop report from that committee he provided an analysis of the use of voice stress technologies in the detection of deception and said \\"not only is there no evidence that voice stress technologies are effective in detecting stress, but also the hypothesis underlying their use has been shown to be false.\\" He was also a member of the NRC Committee on Developing Metrics for Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Research;. On April 6, 2011, he provided testimony at a hearing of the House Committee on Investigations and Oversight - Behavioral Science and Security: Evaluating TSA's SPOT Program. In his written and oral testimony, he criticized the TSA's SPOT passenger screening program, including raising concerns about the limitations that the Department of Homeland Security imposed on an outside review and oversight committee for the SPOT program, known as the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), of which he was a member, saying \\"TAC has not been asked to evaluate the overall SPOT program, the validity of indicators used in the program, consistency across measurement, field conditions, training issues, scientific foundations of the program and/or behavioral detection methodologies, etc. In order to appropriately scientifically evaluate a program like SPOT, all of these and more would be needed.\\" He went on to say, \\"Shining a light on the process by making information on methodologies and results as open as possible (such as with devices like the polygraph, ..., voice-stress analysis, and neuroimaging) is necessary for determining if these technologies and devices are performing in a known and reliable manner. Clearly establishing the scientific validity of underlying premises, foundations, primitives, is essential. The larger the base of comparable scientific studies, the easier it is to establish the validity of techniques and approaches. ... In our desire to protect our citizens from those who intend to harm us, we must make sure that our own behavior is not unnecessarily shaped by things like fear, urgency, institutional incentives or pressures, financial considerations, career and personal goals, the selling of snake oil, etc., that lead to the adoption of approaches that have not been sufficiently and appropriately scientifically vetted.\\" In May 2016 Rubin was a signatory to an Open Letter to the World Health Organization (WHO) calling on them to move or postpone the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro over the 2016 epidemic of Zika fever. He also appeared on air on ESPN with Hannah Storm to discuss risk assessment and Zika. White House Office of Science and Technology Policy In February 2012 Philip Rubin took a position as the Assistant Director for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences at the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) in the Executive Office of the President of the United States. He also served as a Senior Advisor at the National Science Foundation in the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE) Directorate. At OSTP he led the White House's neuroscience initiative. On April 16, 2012, Congressman Chakah Fattah (D-PA) introduced House Resolution 613, supporting the OSTP interagency working group on neuroscience that Rubin organized. The resolution also \\"... commends President Barack Obama for the expeditious appointment of Dr. Philip Rubin to lead the working group's efforts.\\" In June 2012 was named by John Holdren, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology and Director of OSTP, to be OSTP's Principal Assistant Director for Science, taking over the duties of Nobel laureate Carl Wieman, who resigned as Associate Director for Science on June 2. In this new role Rubin also became Co-Chair of the National Science and Technology Council's Committee on Science, serving with other Co-Chairs, Francis Collins and Subra Suresh, Directors of the NIH and NSF, respectively. He also co-chaired the interagency Common Rule Modernization Working Group. During his tenure, key priorities for the OSTP Science Division included: * Support for fundamental and translational research at NIH, NSF, NIST, and NASA. * Public Access to research results, Open Data, and Open Science (led by Michael Stebbins). * Large-scale, scientific infrastructure (led by Gerald Blazey, Altof Carim, and Tamara Dickinson), including such projects as ITER and the James Webb Space Telescope. *Biomedical innovation (led by Michael Stebbins and Col.

Rabin, Tom Rielly, Elliot Schlessel, Ed Seidel, and Sharon Steuer. Rubin is the co-founder, with Elliot Saltzman, of the IS Group, an informal, collaborative group founded in the 1980s of scientists and technologists from around the country exploring cutting-edge issues such as dynamical systems, evolution, artificial intelligence, linguistics, robotics, network science, neuroscience, and other topics. Between 1999 and some time in the early 2000s, Rubin was technical advisor at ZeniMax Media Parent company of video game publisher Bethesda Softworks. Philip Rubin is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences Challenges for International Scientific Partnerships (CISP) Large- Scale Science Working Group. He is also a member of the American Academy's Commission on Language Learning, created to examine the current state of language education in response to a bipartisan request from members of the United States Senate and House of Representatives. Rubin is a member of the Beyond Conflict Neuroscience and Social Conflict Initiative steering committee. This organization assists leaders in divided societies who are struggling with conflict, reconciliation, and societal change. The initiative explores how insights from cognitive science and neuroscience can inform the practice of conflict resolution and diplomacy. In May 2015 Rubin served as a judge for the DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) Robots4Us Student Video Contest and was an invited participant in the activities at the DRC Finals in June 2015. On May 26‚Äì27, 2016 Rubin was a participant in the first ever White House Foster Care and Technology Hackathon. In September, 2016, Rubin was named as Director and Treasurer of iGIANT (impact of Gender/Sex on Innovation and Novel Technologies), founded and led by Dr. Saralyn Mark. In 2017 and 2018, Rubin served as a member of the National Academy of Public Administration's NASA Advisory Council: Organizational Assessment panel. The NASA Authorization Act of 2017 directed the Academy to conduct a review \\"to assess the effectiveness of the NASA Advisory Council and to make recommendations to Congress.\\" In December, 2017, Governor of Connecticut, Dannel P. Malloy, appointed Philip Rubin to serve as a member of the UConn Board of Trustees, the governing body for the University of Connecticut. In October, 2018, Rubin was elected as a member of the Board of Directors of Haskins Laboratories. In December, 2019, he was appointed by the UConn Board as Vice-Chair, leading their new, legislatively encouraged standing committee on Research, Entrepreneurship and Innovation.

On March 9, 2015, Rubin received the COSSA (Consortium of Social Science Associations) Distinguished Service Award \\"in recognition of his career of service to the social and behavioral science community\\". In July 2015, FABBS (Federation of Associations in Behavioral and Brain Sciences) Foundation honored Rubin by adding him to the \\"In Honor Of ...\\" gallery of scientists program that recognizes eminent, senior scientists who have made important and lasting contributions to the sciences of mind, brain, and behavior. On September 29, 2016, Rubin was granted lifetime membership in Nu Rho Psi, The National Honor Society in Neuroscience, \\"In recognition of outstanding achievement in the areas of neuroscience scholarship and research ‚Ä¶\\". In February 2017, Rubin was elected as a member of the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering (CASE). The academy, chartered by the Connecticut General Assembly in 1976 and modeled after the national academies of science, engineering and medicine, conducts research in the public interest. Personal life Philip Rubin was born on May 22, 1949, in Newark, New Jersey. His maternal grandmother was Fannie Auerbach (n√©e Rothschild) (1891-1976). He spent most of his childhood in Newark and graduated in 1967 from Union High School in Union, New Jersey,\\"Philip Rubin: Biographical Sketch\\", Haskins Laboratories. Accessed December 28, 2016. \\"Philip Rubin was born and spent his early years in Newark, New Jersey. He graduated from Union High School in Union, New Jersey, in 1967.\\" where his interest in science, along with classmates such as Marty Kaplan, was nurtured by the inspirational advanced biology teacher Irwin Jaeger. In the 1960s he was a co-founder and guitar player in the seminal New Jersey garage band, \\"The Institution.\\" Rubin is a photographer who, since the 1970s, has concentrated on pictures of wall art, including murals, graffiti, and painted buildings, in the urban centers of the cities that he has visited. Speaking of the transient nature of wall art, he has said, \\"The artist is often unknown; the passing of time and the public venues invite unanticipated collaboration.\\" His work has been exhibited and sold at numerous venues. He is married to Joette Katz, retired Associate Justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court, and currently a partner at the law firm, Shipman & Goodwin LLP. They have two children, Dr. Jason Wilder Katz Rubin, a pediatrician at Seattle Children's Hospital and Assistant Professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, and Samantha Katz, a creative director and curator who is the founder of Created Here.  Popular culture influences  In March 2010, Audiobulb Records released a CD by artist Autistici, titled Detached Metal Voice - Early Works (Vol. I). This album has been described as a collection of tracks that \\"explores the raw extrusion of the human condition.\\" There is an homage to voice synthesis that includes excerpts from many of the early laboratory attempts to produce the human voice via articulatory synthesis, including work pioneered by Philip Rubin and colleagues at Haskins Laboratories, based on earlier work at Bell Laboratories. Rorschach Audio - Art and Illusion for Sound discusses \\"Sine- Wave Speech, The Clangers\\" and other topics, influenced by the sinewave synthesis work of Rubin and colleagues. The sinewave speech projection \\"Poulomi's Ode to Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries\\" was presented at Rich Mix London on Dec. 3, 2010. Selected publications  Fowler, C. A., Rubin, P. E., Remez, R.

It is part of the York Region District School Board. It is located in southeast Markham, bordered by the major arteries McCowan Road to the west, Steeles Avenue to the south, Markham Road to the east and 14th Avenue to the North. History One of MCI's several art filled hallways MCI was built in 1992 to relieve pressure from Milliken Mills High School because of the quickly expanding population of the newly developed East Milliken neighbourhood, which had been forest around the Rouge River. Until 2000, the school was underused, with no more than 130 students graduating each year (compared to about 450 in 2010-2011). Because of a large development process and an even bigger immigrant influx, the school population almost doubled in the next five years and has been steadily climbing since then. In 2009, Middlefield had its first major expansion, building a tech wing with six new classrooms in the Southern Wing. It houses the Auto, Construction, Hairstyling tech classes, and some Applied English classes and Communication Tech classes. In 2013, factors such as a large exiting class and small entering class caused a surplus in teachers, resulting in 17 of them being moved across the board to other schools. Programs The MCI Rotunda MCI has the widest array of Tech courses in South-east York Region. MCI offers Automotive Technology, Transportation Technology, Construction Technology, Design Technology, Computer Technology, Hairstyling and Aesthetic Technology, Communication Technology, Information Technology, Business Technology and Wood Shop. Other than that, the school also provides; *Alternative Education Program *English as a Second Language Program *Specialist High Skills Major in Transportation Technology and Health and Wellness *Special Education Programs *Co-op Education Program MCI stopped offering Advanced Placement courses in 2016, which had been offered in Science, Math and Technology. Athletics Athletic Council Middlefield Athletic Council (MAC) coordinates and funds athletic events such as the athletic banquet. This club allows the students to realize the importance of physical education by promoting healthy living through school events, with the help of the student council.

Middlefield's Senior and Junior Boys Basketball teams both won the 2015 York Region Athletic Association Tier 2 Basketball championship. Intramural sports In addition to competitive sports teams, Middlefield students have the opportunity to participate in in-school sporting events such as: *Middlefield Intramural Hockey Association (MIHA) *Middlefield's Basketball Association (MBA) *Middlefield's Iron Person Mock Trial Team The Middlefield Mock Trial Team, led by Law teachers Mr. Glass and Ms. Mobilos and Mr. Draycott, have been the most successful team from this school. Over the past twelve years, it has made the Elite 8 in Ontario each time, including four silver medals, the last coming in the 2010-2011 year. Middlefield Collegiate Institute is one of the few public high schools which have made it this far in the championship and is the most successful mock trial team from a public high school in Ontario. Middlefield again made the Elite 8 in 2013, winning the GTA South Regionals. Middlefield followed this up by winning the Ontario Bar Association Mock Trial Tournament and becoming Provincial Champions for the first time, defeating Cawthra Park Secondary School. Facilities The elevator at MCI MCI has a large glass ceiling in the rotunda, which is renovated biennially, to check for possible hazards and risks, and to replace any cracked or possible dangerous glass. This glass ceiling can be seen from almost anywhere in the central section of the school, and is a staple of Middlefield culture. The ceiling also gives in light and provides it for the central wing as well, thus helping reduce MCI's environmental impact, and is one of the reasons MCI was certified a Silver Eco School. MCI is atrium shaped, and from the first floor of the rotunda, can look up and see the third floor. There is also a glass elevator which provides travel between the three floors, but can only be used by staff or students who have disabilities. As the local community continued to grow, MCI required an extension of the building to accommodate for the growing student body. In June 2008, construction began to create an extended west wing to the school. The wing is only one storey high, and consists of a hairstyling classroom, construction classroom, garage, two washrooms, and an emergency exit. *Anime club *Art Labs *Wood Shop *Cafeteria *Communication Technological Labs *Family Studies Labs *SAC Office *Drama stage *Gymnasiums *Food Lab *Guidance Office *Outdoor - Baseball Diamond, Soccer Fields, Running Track *Music Room *Weight Room *Photography Dark Room *Library *Hairstyling *Auto shop Academics Middlefield Collegiate is ranked 8 of 676 Ontario high schools on the 2014‚Äì2015 Fraser Institute school report, with an overall rating of 9.1 out of 10.

PhK phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase at two serine residues, triggering a conformational shift which favors the more active glycogen phosphorylase ‚Äúa‚Äù form over the less active glycogen phosphorylase b. The protein is a hexadecameric holoenzyme‚Äîthat is, a homotetramer in which each subunit is itself a tetramer‚Äîarranged in an approximate ‚Äúbutterfly‚Äù shape. Each of the subunits is composed of an Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥ and Œ¥ subunit. The Œ≥ subunit is the site of the enzyme's catalytic activity while the other three subunits serve regulatory functions. When unmodified, the Œ± and Œ≤ subunits inhibit the enzyme's catalysis, but phosphorylation of both these subunits by protein kinase A (PKA, or cAMP-dependent protein kinase) reduces their respective inhibitory activities. The Œ¥ subunit is the ubiquitous eukaryotic protein calmodulin which itself has 4 calcium ion binding sites. When cytosolic Ca2+ levels rise-to as low as 10‚àí7 M‚Äîthe Œ¥ subunit undergoes a large conformational change that activates the kinase's activity by binding to a complementary hydrophobic patch on the catalytic Œ≥ subunit. Genes * Alpha: PHKA1, PHKA2 * Beta: PHKB * Gamma: PHKG1, PHKG2 History Phosphorylase kinase was the first protein kinase to be isolated and characterized in detail, accomplished first by Krebs, Graves and Fischer in the 1950s. At the time, the scientific community was largely unaware of the importance of protein phosphorylation in the regulation of cellular processes, and many in the field dismissed phosphoproteins as biologically unimportant. Since covalent modification by phosphorylation is a widespread, important method of biochemical regulation in a wide variety of cellular processes, the discovery of this reaction has had enormous impact on scientific understanding of regulatory mechanisms. The substrate of PhK, glycogen phosphorylase, had been isolated by Carl and Gerty Cori in the 1930s, who determined that there were two forms: an inactive form b and an active form a. However, for unknown reasons at the time, the only way to isolate glycogen phosphorylase a from muscle tissue was by paper filtration ‚Äì other methods, such as centrifugation, would not work. It was a critical insight on the part of Fischer et al. that it was the presence of calcium ions in the filter paper that was generating the active ‚Äúa‚Äù isoform. Later research revealed that the calcium ions were in fact activating phosphorylase kinase via the Œ¥ regulatory subunit, leading to the phosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase. Mechanism The precise details of the PhK‚Äôs catalytic mechanism are still under study. While this may seem surprising given that it was isolated over 50 years ago, there are significant difficulties in studying the finer details of PhK‚Äôs structure and mechanism due to its large size and high degree of complexity. In the active site, there is significant homology between PhK and other so-called P-loop protein kinases such as protein kinase A (PKA, cAMP-dependent kinase). In contrast to these other proteins, which typically require phosphorylation of a serine or tyrosine residue in the catalytic site to be active, the catalytic Œ≥ subunit of PhK is constitutively active due to the presence of a negatively charged glutamate residue, Glu-182. Structural and biochemical data suggest one possible mechanism of action for the phosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase by PhK involves the direct transfer of phosphate from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the substrate serine. Structure Phosphorylase kinase is a 1.3 MDa hexadecameric holoenzyme, though its size can vary somewhat due to substitution of different subunit isoforms via mRNA splicing. It consists of four homotetramers each comprised four subunits (Œ±,Œ≤,Œ¥,Œ≥). Only the Œ≥ subunit is known to possess catalytic activity, while the others serve regulatory functions. Due to the instability of the regulatory subunits in solution, only the Œ≥ subunit has been crystallized individually: Overall, the subunits are arranged in two lobes oriented back-to-back in what has been described as a ‚Äúbutterfly‚Äù shape with D2 symmetry. Each lobe consists of two tetramers, each consisting of the Œ±Œ≤Œ¥Œ≥ subunits as described earlier. The Œ¥ subunit is indistinguishable from cellular calmodulin, while the Œ± and Œ≤ subunits are close homologues of each other which are proposed to have arisen by gene duplication and subsequent differentiation. Biological function and regulation Overview of phosphorylase kinase regulation. Physiologically, phosphorylase kinase plays the important role of stimulating glycogen breakdown into free glucose-1-phosphate by phosphorylating glycogen phosphorylase and stabilizing its active conformation. This activity is particularly important in liver and muscle cells, though for somewhat different purposes. While muscle cells generally break down glycogen to power their immediate activity, liver cells are responsible for maintaining glucose concentration in the bloodstream. Thus, the regulatory mechanisms of PhK activity vary somewhat depending on cell type. In general, the enzyme is regulated allosterically and by reversible phosphorylation. Hormones, nerve impulses and muscle contraction stimulate the release of calcium ions. These act as an allosteric activator, binding to the Œ¥ subunits of phosphorylase kinase, and partly activating enzyme activity. This binding partly stabilizes the protein in the active form. The phosphorylase kinase is completely activated when the Œ≤ and Œ± subunits are phosphorylated by protein kinase A and the delta subunit has bound to calcium ions. In muscle cells, phosphorylation of the Œ± and Œ≤ subunits by PKA is the result of a cAMP-mediated cell signaling cascade initiated by the binding of epinephrine to Œ≤-adrenergic receptors on the cell surface. Additionally, the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum during muscle contraction inactivates the inhibitory Œ¥ subunit and activates PhK fully. In liver cells, the process is somewhat more complex. Both glucagon and epinephrine can trigger the cAMP-PKA cascade, while epinephrine also binds to the Œ±-adrenergic receptor to trigger a phosphoinositide cascade, resulting in the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum. When the cell needs to stop glycogen breakdown, PhK is dephosphorylated by protein phosphatases 1 and 2, returning the Œ± and Œ≤ subunits to their initial inhibitory configuration. Relation to disease Defects in phosphorylase kinase genes are the cause of glycogen storage disease type IX (GSD type IX) and GSD type VI (formerly GSD type VIII), which can affect the liver and/or muscles. Among these gene defects, some of the most common are the X-linked liver glycogenosis (XLG) diseases, which can be subdivided into XLG I and XLG II. Clinically, these diseases manifest in slow childhood body development and abnormal enlargement of the liver. In XLG I, PhK activity is abnormally reduced in both blood cells and liver cells, while in XLG II enzyme activity is diminished only in liver cells. These diseases are both due to mutations in the PHKA2 gene, which codes for the Œ± subunit of phosphorylase kinase. In the case of XLG I, mutations are often nonsense mutations which result in malformed, unstable Œ± subunits, while mutations in XLG II tend to be missense changes which alter the subunits less severely. Based on bioinformatic and structural data, some have suggested that the Œ± and Œ≤ subunits may have catalytic activity similar to glycoamylases, and that missense mutations in these regions of the Œ± subunit may contribute to the symptoms of XLG II. However, this proposed catalytic activity has yet to be proven directly.

It is one of 32 high schools administered by the York Region District School Board. History Markville S.S. is located in an area that was developed by the Melchior Quantz family of Germany in the city of Markham who came to North America with William Berczy. The terrain map of 1860 shows five houses fronting on present day McCowan Road, all inhabited by members of the family, the senior member of which was George B. Quantz and his wife, Jane Bradburn. The original name given to the school was Quantztown Secondary School as well as Melchior Quantz High School around 1990, but this was later changed to Markville Secondary School because the school is located between the Towns of Markham and Unionville. The school was not completed at the start of the school year of 1990, so students started the school year at Markham District High School. Markville S.S. was officially opened in late fall of 1990. The school opened with Grades 9, 10, and some Grade 11 students, with Grades 11 and 12 age students being allowed stay at either Unionville High School or Markham District High School. In 1996, an addition to the third floor provided a new math and computer wing. A child-care centre, Markville Child Care Centre, is operated by Family Day Care Services. Academics History As of 2009, teachers Adrienne Chong, Rob Cotey and Mark Melnyk have received the Prime Minister's Awards for Teaching Excellence. They teach Canadian and World History, World Politics, Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity, World History to the End of the 15th Century, Honours Thesis, and World Religions through grades 10 to 12. Music Each year, the music students of Markville compete in several music festivals. These include the OBA (Ontario Band Association), Kiwanis Music Festival, and Music Alive. In addition, two concerts are held at the Markham Theatre. \\"Festive Sounds\\" is held in winter, and \\"Markville Pops\\" is held in the spring. Markville offers many music courses for grades 9 through 12, including: *Concert Band/Strings *Symphonic Band/Strings *Senior Band/Strings *Senior String *Chamber Choir *Junior Choir *Senior Choir *Music Theatre *Music and Computers *Jazz Band/Choir *Keyboard Class *Guitar Class Peer tutoring Markville's students volunteer to tutor others in subjects such as French and math.

Although the community was called Scotia, the name of the local post office was Benore (Ben being the Gaelic for \\"mountain [of]\\"). It got its start when Andrew Carnegie, through the Edgar Thomson Steel Company, leased large tracts of iron ore in the township. Small-scale mining had taken place here since the late 18th century, but Carnegie organized a major effort to exploit the deposits in 1880. Ore was removed from a broad open pit, washed to separate it from clay, and loaded onto railcars. The Pennsylvania Railroad had extended its Fairbrook Branch to the village in 1881, and hauled the ore to steel mills in Pittsburgh. There was also an extensive narrow-gauge railroad in the pits to haul ore to the washer, and several artesian wells and a reservoir to supply water for ore washing. Carnegie sold the ore deposits to the Bellefonte Furnace Company in 1899, feeling that they were no longer economical to work and ship to Pittsburgh. Immediately after the sale, the Bellefonte Central Railroad built a new branch from Graysdale to Scotia, allowing the ore to be shipped directly to the company's furnaces rather than take a roundabout route on the PRR. However, mining halted in about 1913, and all the assets of the Bellefonte Furnace Company were sold at foreclosure in 1914. The Bellefonte Central abandoned its line to Scotia in 1915, and the PRR in 1927. The village had already been vacated in 1922 or 1923. There was a brief attempt to revive mining at Scotia during World War II, and the Bellefonte Central received Reconstruction Finance Corporation money to build a new branch from Alto to Scotia to serve the new facilities. However, the mine was only briefly in operation before the cessation of hostilities, and soon ceased permanently. The area is now encompassed by Pennsylvania State Game Lands No. 176.

It forms part of the Petrie Terrace Heritage Trail. History Named after merchant, writer and printer William Caxton, the thoroughfare developed considerably alongside the subdivision of land in the 1860s. The ensuing decades saw the construction of The Caxton Hotel (1864), the Baroona Oddfellows hall (1883) and the Prince Alfred Hotel (1887). An electric tramline was constructed between 1897 and 1898. The Ithaca Baths were constructed around 1905. In order to ease congestion, the street was grade-separated at its intersection with Hale Street in the 1960s. Since the 1980s, Caxton Street has established itself as a thriving nightlife precinct, with an array of nightclubs, restaurants and live entertainment venues. The Caxton Street Seafood and Wine Festival has been held in the street annually since 1994. Caxton Street is also famous for the 'running of the buses', an annual event during the Australian Rugby League's State of Origin series, at which thousands of fans flock to the street in order to cheer their team's bus and boo their respective opposition as they proceed to Lang Park. During the 2014 G-20 Brisbane summit, Burmese president Thein Sein and German chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as delegates of the United Nations, reportedly stayed at Gambaro's Hotel, located on the street. During her visit, Merkel stopped in at bars on Caxton Street and posed for photos with locals.

It typically presents before the age of 18 months. These hemiplegic attacks can cause anything from mild weakness to complete paralysis on one or both sides of the body, and they can vary greatly in duration. Attacks may also alternate from one side of the body to the other, or alternate between affecting one or both sides during a single attack. Besides hemiplegia, symptoms of the disorder include an extremely broad range of neurological and developmental impairments which are not well understood. Normally, hemiplegia and other associated symptoms cease completely with sleep, but they may recur upon waking. Most frequently AHC is caused by a spontaneous mutation in the ATP1A3 gene.2. It is an extremely rare disorder ‚Äì approximately 1 in 1,000,000 people have AHC. It was only recently discovered, having first been characterized in 1971. Signs and symptoms AHC patients exhibit a wide range of symptoms in addition to hemiplegic attacks. These can be further characterized as paroxysmal and non-paroxysmal symptoms. Paroxysmal symptoms are generally associated with hemiplegic attacks and may occur suddenly with hemiplegia or on their own. Paroxysmal symptoms may last for variable amounts of time. Non-paroxysmal symptoms tend to be side effects of AHC which are present at all times, not just during episodes or attacks. Epilepsy, which is also considered a paroxysmal symptom, plays an important role in the progression and diagnosis of AHC. Hemiplegic attacks Chronologically, hemiplegic attacks are not always the first symptom of AHC, but they are the most prominent symptom, as well as the symptom for which the disorder is named. Hemiplegic attacks may affect one or both sides of the body, and attacks which affect both sides of the body may be referred to as either bilateral or quadriplegic attacks. One of the unique characteristics of AHC is that hemiplegic attacks, as well as other symptoms which may co-occur with hemiplegia, cease immediately upon sleep. During strong attacks, the symptoms may reoccur upon waking. Hemiplegic attacks can occur suddenly or gradually, and the severity of an attack can vary over its duration. The attacks may alternate from one side of the body to another, though this is rare. The length of attacks may also vary from minutes to weeks, though length of attacks varies more greatly between people than between attacks for one person. Both bilateral and hemiplegic attacks are associated with pseudobulbar features such as dysphagia, dysarthria, and respiratory difficulty. Paralysis is also often accompanied by changes in skin color and temperature, sweating, restlessness, tremor, screaming, and the appearance of pain. Hemiplegic attacks happen irregularly and can occur with speech, eating, and swallowing impairment. Patients with AHC are frequently underweight due to these side effects. The average age of onset for hemiplegic episodes has been found to be 6‚Äì7 months of age. This early onset gives the name of this disorder the slightly misleading ending \\"of childhood\\". AHC is not exclusively limited to childhood ‚Äì attacks in some cases become milder after the first ten years of life, but they never completely disappear. Paroxysmal symptoms AHC patients have exhibited various paroxysmal symptoms which manifest to different degrees in each person. Paroxysmal symptoms include tonic, tonic-clonic, or myoclonic limb movements, dystonic posturing, choreoathetosis, occular nystagmus, and various other ocular motor abnormalities. Almost half of all people have dystonic symptoms prior to experiencing hemiplegia. These symptoms generally begin before 8 months of age. Ocular motor abnormalities occur early, and these are the most frequent early symptoms of AHC, particularly nystagmus. Almost 1/3 of people with this disorder had episodic ocular motor features within 1‚Äì2 days of birth. Many also experienced hemiplegia and dystonia before 3 months of age. A final symptom that may be considered paroxysmal is a temporary change in behavior - some patients will become unreasonable, demanding, and aggressive either before or after an attack Not all patients have all of these symptoms, and it is not known whether they are caused by AHC. Symptoms usually manifest in the first 3 months of the child's life, with an average onset of 2.5 months. Frequently, some of these symptoms will manifest in the neonatal period. These paroxysmal symptoms are often used to help diagnose AHC, since there is no simple test for it. In some cases, EEGs taken during these paroxysmal events were characterized by a generalized background slowing. Overall however, EEG during episodes and other investigative methods such as brain MRI, TACs, angiographic MRIs and CFS have normal results. Non-paroxysmal symptoms In the long term, many paroxysmal symptoms occur along with AHC, and while these symptoms vary in strength depending on the person, they are consistent features of AHC. It is thought that some of these symptoms are brought on or worsened by hemiplegic attacks, though it is not known for certain. Patients suffer persistent motor, movement (ataxia), and cognitive deficits. These deficits become more apparent over time and include developmental delays, social problems, and retardation. It is rare for someone with AHC not to have cognitive deficits, but a study in Japan did find two patients who met all of the diagnostic criteria for AHC but who were not mentally impaired. It is not known whether AHC is a progressive disease, but severe attacks are suspected to cause damage which result in permanent loss of function. 100% of children studied in the USA have had some form of mental impairment, which is usually described as mild to moderate, but varies greatly among individuals. Epilepsy At least 50% of AHC sufferers also suffer from epilepsy, and AHC is often misdiagnosed as epilepsy because of this. These epileptic events are distinguished from other episodes by an alteration of consciousness, as well as frequent tonic or tonic-clonic activity. Epileptic episodes are generally rare, though they do increase with age. Due to the rarity of epileptic episodes, there are few EEG confirmations of them. Cause Recent research suggests that AHC is caused by a de novo (spontaneous) genetic mutation in the ATP1A3 gene on chromosome 19 (locus 19q13.31) which encodes enzyme ATP1A3. A small number of cases seem to be caused by a mutation in the ATP1A2 gene. Where the mutation is inherited, it has the autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Previously AHC was thought to be a form of complicated migraine because of strong family histories of migraine reported in AHC cases. AHC has also been considered to be a movement disorder or a form of epilepsy. Suggested causes have included channelopathy, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cerebrovascular dysfunction. The disorder most closely related to AHC is familial hemiplegic migraine which is caused by a mutation in a gene for calcium channel receptors. It was thus thought that AHC may be caused by a similar channelopathy. Diagnosis As of 1993 only approximately 30 people with AHC had been described in scientific literature. Due to the rarity and complexity of AHC, it is not unusual for the initial diagnosis to be incorrect, or for diagnosis to be delayed for several months after the initial symptoms become apparent. The average age of diagnosis is just over 36 months. Diagnosis of AHC is not only difficult because of its rarity, but because there is no diagnostic test, making this a diagnosis of exclusion. There are several generally accepted criteria which define this disorder, however other conditions with a similar presentation, such as HSV encephalitis, must first be ruled out. Due to these diagnostic difficulties, it is possible that the commonness of the disease is underestimated. The following descriptions are commonly used in the diagnosis of AHC. The initial four criteria for classifying AHC were that it begins before 18 months of age, includes attacks of both hemiplegia on either side of the body, as well as other autonomic problems such as involuntary eye movement (episodic monocular nystagmus), improper eye alignment, choreoathetosis, and sustained muscle contractions (dystonia). Finally, patients suffer from intellectual disabilities, delayed development, and other neurological abnormalities. These diagnostic criteria were updated in 1993 to include the fact that all of these symptoms dissipate immediately upon sleeping. Diagnostic criteria were also expanded to include episodes of bilateral hemiplegia which shifted from one side of the body to the other. Recent criteria have been proposed for screening for AHC early, in order to improve the diagnostic timeline. These screening criteria include focal or unilateral paroxysmal dystonia in the first 6 months of life, as well as the possibility of flaccid hemiplegia either with or separate from these symptoms. Paroxysmal ocular movements should also be considered, and these should include both binocular and monocular symptoms which show in the first 3 months of life.  Treatments  Overall outcomes for AHC are generally poor, which is contributed to by AHC's various diagnostic and management challenges. In the long term, AHC is debilitating due to both the hemiplegic attacks and permanent damage associated with AHC. This damage can include cognitive impairment, behavioral and psychiatric disorders, and various motor impairments. There is, however, not yet any conclusive evidence that AHC is fatal or that it shortens life expectancy, but the relatively recent discovery of the disorder makes large data for this type of information unavailable. Treatment for AHC has not been extremely successful, and there is no cure. There are several drugs available for treatment, as well as management strategies for preventing and dealing with hemiplegic attacks. Management strategies Hemiplegic attacks can be brought on by particular triggers, and management of AHC often centers around avoiding common or known triggers. While triggers vary greatly from person to person, there are also some common ones which are prevalent in many patients. Common triggers include temperature changes, water exposure, bright lights, certain foods, emotional stress, and physical activity. While avoiding triggers may help, it cannot prevent all hemiplegic episodes because many occur without being triggered. Because attacks and other associated symptoms end with sleep, various sedatives can be used to help patients sleep. Flunarizine The most common drug used to treat AHC is flunarizine. Flunarizine functions by acting as a calcium channel blocker. Other drugs, in order of frequency of use are benzodiazepines, carbamazapine, barbiturates, and valproic acid. Flunarizine is prescribed for the purpose of reducing the severity of AHC attacks and the number of episodes, though it rarely stops attacks altogether. Minimizing the attacks may help reduce damage to the body from hemiplegic attacks and improve long- term outcomes as far as mental and physical disabilities are concerned. Experts differ in their confidence in flunarizine's effectiveness. Some studies have found it to be very effective in reducing the duration, severity, and frequency of hemiplegic attacks. It is generally considered the best treatment available, but this drug is thought by some to be of little benefit to AHC patients. Many patients suffer adverse effects without seeing any improvement. Flunarizine also causes problems because it is difficult for patients to obtain, as it is not readily available in the United States. Sodium oxybate Current research at the University of Utah is investigating whether sodium oxybate, also known as Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid is an effective treatment for AHC. Thus far, only a small number of patients have been sampled, and no conclusive results are yet available. While some success has been had thus far with the drug, AHC patients have been known to respond well initially to other drugs, but then the effectiveness will decline over time. Currently, sodium oxybate is used as a narcolepsy-cataplexy treatment, though in the past it has been used controversially in nutritional supplements. This drug was chosen to test because of a possible link between the causes of narcolepsy-cataplexy and AHC.

It is located on State Route 96, near the Oregon border. The name \\"Klamath\\" was derived from an Indian word Tlamatl which means \\"swiftness\\" in Chinook. The community of Klamath River is about long and includes both sides of the river from Gottville to Kohl Creek. The population is 190.  History  The Klamath River area was home to the Hupa (Hoopa), Karuk, Modoc, and Yurok Indian tribes. Native Americans relied on the river for its abundance of salmon and trout. The California Gold Rush of 1848‚Äì1855 brought many miners to the Klamath River watershed. The miners caused disruption in the lives of the Native Americans of the area by damming and diverting water for mining purposes, which made it difficult for spawning salmon and other fish populations to survive. There are remnants of old mining sites along the river. The town of Happy Camp, first settled in 1851, was named for its fruitful yields of gold. The Klamath River was used by the Quicksilver Mining Co. in the late 19th century where they extracted mercury and cinnabar located up Beaver Creek. Tunnels that were dug to extract gold were later used by bootleggers of whiskey.  Wildlife and the environment  Klamath River hosts the largest deer herd in California, and the largest concentrations of ducks and geese on the North American continent. There are also many black bear, elk, bobcat, mountain lion, raccoon, quail, grouse, pheasant, squirrel, kit fox, river otter, beaver, badger, porcupine, weasel, skunks, coyotes, a variety of toads and frogs, blue herons, bald and American eagles, along with over 200 species of birds. Historically, the Klamath River was the third largest salmon water-shed on the west coast.

Discharged in 1905, he moved to Seward, obtaining a position as manager of the Seward Drug Company. Local newspapers ads described him as a \\"Physician and Surgeon\\". In 1909, David moved to Susitna Station to serve as a United States Marshal. The next year, he moved to Knik, where he was appointed a U.S. Commissioner. He served as an ex- officio probate judge, studying law on his own time and gaining admission into the Washington State Bar Association. In 1915, David moved with his family to the tent city at Ship Creek. When the land for the future city of Anchorage was auctioned off, he acquired two lots. In 1917, he designed and built a house on Second Avenue, which stands to this day. Anchorage was legally incorporated on November 23, 1920. On November 29, the newly elected city council designated David as the first mayor of Anchorage. In 1921, he joined Seward attorney L.V Ray in private law practice. David ran the firm's Anchorage office. After a second term as mayor, he joined the Board of Regents of the University of Alaska. David died on November 21, 1924 of heart failure.

It is part of the Androscoggin River watershed. It is located in the western part of Maine, near the border with the state of New Hampshire and the Canadian province of Quebec. The lake is just a few miles from the Appalachian Trail. Mooselookmeguntic Lake receives water from several sources. The Cupsuptic River flows into Cupsuptic Lake, which is directly connected with the northern part of Mooselookmeguntic Lake. The Rangeley River and Kennebago River both flow into northeastern Mooselookmeguntic Lake. The lake's waters flow out to the southeast, into Upper Richardson Lake. There is a dam between the two lakes called \\"Upper Dam\\". The dam raised the level of Mooselookmeguntic Lake about 14 feet, causing it to become joined to Cupsuptic Lake forming a reservoir. The two lakes had been separate before the dam was built. Mooselookmeguntic Lake's maximum depth is and its surface area is . It is the fourth largest lake in Maine. Mooselookmeguntic Lake's elevation is 1,467 feet (447 meters) above sea level. There are two islands in the southern portion of Mooselookmeguntic Lake called \\"Toothaker Island\\" and \\"Students Island\\".  River name  The name \\"Mooselookmeguntic\\" is an Abnaki word for \\"moose feeding place\\"; although a humorous legend states that a Native American was hunting moose in the area, and spotted one. The native had forgotten to load his rifle but took the shot anyway. Thinking his rifle was damaged, he began yelling to his companion. Variant names listed by the USGS include \\"Mooselocmaguntic Lake\\" and \\"Mooselookmeguntick Lake\\". Mooselookmeguntic Lake is tied for the longest place name in the United States. It has seventeen letters, along with Kleinfeltersville, Pennsylvania.  Fishing  The lake has a variety of fish, and is a popular tourist attraction for fishing.  In literature  Lake Mooselookmeguntic is the location of the action in the book \\"Magic Thinks Big\\", an illustrated children's book by Elisha Cooper.

History His father, Jacques Gaisman (n√© Geissmann), was an immigrant originally from Dornach, a village near Mulhouse, France (in the Alsace region bordering Germany and France), but who fled worsening political pressures, and immigrated to New Orleans in 1852. His parents Sarah and Jacques married in Memphis, Tennessee in 1864. Henry J. Gaisman was born in 1869 in Memphis, Tennessee, the youngest of four children. His father, Jacques, died in Memphis during a Yellow Fever epidemic when Henry was age 3. After his father's death, his mother, Sarah, moved the family to Cincinnati, OH, where Henry spent some of his early childhood trying to help support his family by working as a newsboy. Already at age 9 Henry invented a medium for street car advertising. Unable to afford the lengthy schooling required to study mechanical engineering and chemistry (his first interests), he left school at age 13 to work various odd jobs. At age 16 he invented the glass-enclosed bulletin boards commonly used in hotel lobbies. He then worked briefly as a leather worker, then a leather dealer, and in 1894 moved to New York City, where he sold his first financially successful invention, a belt that wouldn't slip. Later, he invented the safety razor, an invention which would allow him to develop into a wealthy businessman despite never completing his formal education. His safety razor was patented in May and July 1904, and was initially sold by the Auto Strop Safety Razor Company, a competitor to razor and blade manufacturer Gillette Razor Corporation, run by Mr. King C. Gillette. When Mr. Gaisman found similar technologies in the Gillette razors, his company sued the Gillette Razor Corporation for patent infringement, which Mr. Gillette resolved by merging with Auto Strop. When Mr. Gaisman came on board at the Gillette corporation, he found financial reporting errors which shook investor confidence and briefly caused the Gillette stock to drop. When Mr. Gillette eventually died at age 77, Mr. Gaisman went on to become the leader of the Gillette Razor Corporation. In 1914, he also developed the autographic camera, a process where photographers could write small notes on the edge of their negatives. The rights to this process were purchased by George Eastman (of Eastman Kodak) in 1914 for the sum of $300,000. After his razorblade patent ran out in 1921, he continued to develop newer razorblade technologies in an effort to protect his patent. On November 21, 1922, he applied for a new patent on a newer razor technology with a double-edged safety blade that would fit into the Gillette handles, but the Gillette blades would not fit into his newer handles. On June 28, 1927, he was granted the patent for this newer \\"Probak\\" razor, and in 1928 he founded the Probak Razor Corporation. In 1932, at age 63 and still a bachelor, he moved from his Park Avenue apartment home to Hartsdale, NY after purchasing of land from George Christiancy, former U.S. Minister to Peru and stockbroker. Shortly thereafter, he purchased of adjacent undeveloped land from the Healy estate, the neighboring A.P. Theobald estate, and a tract from the Kuzmier estate, giving him a total of along Ridge Road in Hartsdale. The Business Week magazine of 26 November 1930 described Mr. Gaisman as \\"... of medium height, of benign mien. He lives in a Park Avenue apartment in a state of contented batchelorhood [sic] ... He has voiced doubts as to whether any woman could live with him. The doubt applies to unconventional working habits and not to personal disposition. If he gets an idea in the middle of the night there is no more sleep for him. Like Gillette, Gaisman is an incurable inventor. Also like Gillette, Gaisman possesses a quality notoriously lacking in most inventors ‚Äì shrewd executive ability.\\" He retired from the Gilette Safety Razor Corporation in 1938, at which time he was reputed to be worth more than 25 million dollars. In 1948, while in Mt. Sinai hospital for routine medical care, he met Catherine (\\"Kitty\\") Vance (1919 - May 1, 2010), then a 29-year- old nursing supervisor and native of New Rochelle. Four years later, on 18 April 1952, at age 82, he married Catherine, then aged 33. Initially, the couple considered selling their land to Westchester County to build a new site for the Westchester Community College. However, the couple changed their plans before the deal could be completed, and despite County threats to take the land through condemnation, he and his wife Catherine passed the title for their land to the New York Archdiocese in 1957 for $600,000, with the provision they could live on the estate as long as they wished. (The Westchester Community College was eventually built on the John Augustine Hartford estate on Grasslands Road in Valhalla.) In 1971, at age 101, Mr. Gaisman was quoted in Who Said what (and When, and Where, and How) () as saying, \\"I don't think that what anyone does is worth too much attention. I like to know what's going on. I want to be alive.\\" Mr. Gaisman died in White Plains in 1974, at age 104, and was buried at the Gates of Heaven cemetery in Hawthorne. His wife continued to live on the estate until 1995, when she moved to Connecticut to live near family. On May 1, 2010 she suddenly died at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York at the age of 91. She was buried beside her husband. The estate in Hartsdale was used as a home for retired Catholic nuns, and has since been purchased by the town of Greenburgh, where it has been turned into a nature preserve. Retired nuns continue to live on the estate today. References External links *Google Patent Search for Henry J. Gaisman *Obituary for Catherine V.

The Pi≈Çsudskiites had a major influence on Polish politics in the interwar period. History Pi≈Çsudski was the dominant political figure in the interwar Second Polish Republic. Most of the successive governments favored Pilsudski, who served as Chief of State from 1918 to 1922 and as Prime Minister in 1926-28 and for several months in 1930. Pi≈Çsudski was highly influential and never dropped out of public life, remaining active in Polish politics and exercising considerable influence until his death in May 1935. Pi≈Çsudski special position was highlighted by his holding the position of the General Inspector of the Armed Forces, which was created specifically for him and wasn't responsible to the Sejm (parliament) but only to the President. In May 1926 Pi≈Çsudskiite forces conducted the May Coup, deposing the legally elected government and installing their own. The Sanacja political camp was formed and Pi≈Çsudski's power grew. The Sanacja began to strengthen its own power and curb the activities of opposition political parties. Many parties in that time became Pi≈Çsudskiite to get closer to power and stay safe from potential problems. When Pi≈Çsudski died in May 1935, the Pi≈Çsudskiite Sanacja movement lost its leader. The political situation in Poland became radicalized and the pressure of opposition camps on the ruling Sanacja (especially from the right-wing National Democracy) became stronger. In order to unite the Pi≈Çsudskiites and hold on to power, the leading Pi≈Çsudskiite politicians formed the Camp of National Unity. In order to gain voters from the opposition National Democracy, the Camp of National Unity radicalized its program and even took some issues from the opposition right-wing camp, and became more nationalist.

Background and criminal activities Born in Lebanon, the father of two was listed in a Central Intelligence Agency report as a member of Al-Qaeda and it was claimed that he had received training from the Taliban in 1998. He was also a subject of intelligence reports at the time of the 2000 Sydney Olympics. The television program Four Corners has accused him of being a confidant of al-Qaeda's leader Osama bin Laden. On 25 September 2009 the Supreme Court of New South Wales sentenced Bilal Khazal to 14 years in prison, with a non-parole period of 9 years, for producing a book whilst knowing it was connected with assisting a terrorist attack that would happen in Australia. In 2011 the conviction was overturned and Khazal was granted bail by the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Sydney on 7 June 2011, after spending nearly three years in jail. Khazal's barrister, Charles Waterstreet, said that his jail conditions had been \\"just one step down from Guant√°namo Bay\\".

The brigade was detached from the division on 1 July 1918 and posted to North Persia Force where it remained until 31 August 1919. First World War formation The following units served with the brigade: * 9th (Service) Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment * 7th (Service) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment * 9th (Service) Battalion, Worcestershire Regiment * 7th (Service) Battalion, Prince of Wales's (North Staffordshire Regiment) * 39th Machine Gun Company (joined 25 October 1916) * 39th Supply and Transport Column, Army Service Corps (joined January 1917) * 'G' Trench Mortar Battery (joined on 13 January 1917; transferred to 38th Brigade on 7 October 1917) * 39th Trench Mortar Battery ('H' Battery joined from 36th Indian Brigade, 14th Indian Division on 8 October 1917; renamed 39th Battery on 18 February 1918) * 39th Small Arms Ammunition Section (joined by March 1918) Second World War The Brigade was not reformed for the Second World War. Post Second World War The Brigade was reformed in the early 1950s in the United Kingdom, and on the reformation of the 3rd Infantry Division on 1 April 1951, the Brigade became part of it, along with the 19th Infantry Brigade and 32nd Guards Brigade. Its first operational summons was in October that year, when it was moved to Cyprus aboard two aircraft carriers, and then on to Egypt. It took up duties in the south of the canal zone with two battalions, the 1st Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment) and 1st Battalion, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers. It was joined by 1st Battalion, The Border Regiment, soon afterwards. In October 1952, it was returned to the UK in order to rebuild the strategic reserve, and in February 1953, it was warned for operations in Kenya. Again at a strength of two battalions, 1st Buffs being joined by 1st Battalion, The Devonshire Regiment, it arrived in April 1953 and was soon deployed in Kenya's Rift Valley, commanded by Brigadier J.W. Tweedie. After over a year of operations, both the Buffs and Devons were withdrawn and relieved in December 1954 and January 1955, respectively. Reliefs were 1st Battalion King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry and 1st Battalion The Rifle Brigade. The Brigade left Kenya in 1956 for Northern Ireland. Having been withdrawn from Kenya, the Brigade HQ under Brigadier C.H. ('Monkey') Blacker was dispatched to Aden from Northern Ireland in May 1964, to relieve HQ Aden Garrison in an operational role at Thumier. The Brigade was involved in operations along the Radfan until October, when control was passed to HQ 24th Infantry Brigade. Northern Ireland Back in the UK, the Brigade joined the reforming 5th Infantry Division on its establishment on 1 April 1968. From August 1969, the Brigade, as 39 Airportable Brigade, was involved in The Troubles in Northern Ireland, eventually taking on responsibility, under HQ Northern Ireland, for an area including Belfast and the eastern side of the province, but excluding the South Armagh border region. From September 1970, it was commanded by (then) Brigadier Frank Kitson.Bloody Sunday Inquiry website‚ÄîStatement of General Sir Frank Kitson. Retrieved 28 May 2008.

Niki is the wife of D. L. Hawkins (Leonard Roberts) and mother of Micah Sanders (Noah Gray-Cabey). Niki, a sufferer of dissociative identity disorder, displays superhuman strength, being able to literally rip others in half. Initially, she is able to access this power only when her alter ego \\"Jessica\\" is in control. Tim Kring, the creator of the show, stated that he originally created Niki with the power to be in two places at once, which stems from her life as a single mother. Niki was also originally written to be a showgirl. However, Ali Larter did not fit their original vision of a showgirl, so the character's profession was changed to internet stripper. According to writers Joe Pokaski and Aron Coleite, Niki was written out of the series and replaced with Tracy Strauss so that Larter could play a different role, as they realized that they could not go further with the character. The change also allowed them to tell an origin story, where the character discovers that she has powers. Background One of three identical triplets injected with Arthur Petrelli's formula as babies, Niki was adopted by a wealthy father named Hal Sanders. An abusive alcoholic, Hal would often beat Niki and her sister, Jessica, during his drunken rages. Eventually, Hal strangled Jessica to death and abandoned his remaining daughter. As an adult, Niki had no memory of her father's actions and simply believed he ran out on her. At some point in her life, Niki herself became an alcoholic and a problem gambler, but she managed to overcome her problems. On her first anniversary of sobriety, Niki attended an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. There, she was reunited with her father, Hal, who wanted to make amends. Niki introduced Hal to her husband, D. L., and her son, Micah. Hal gave the boy a computer, but when he became angry at his grandson for taking the expensive gift apart, Niki demanded that he leave. After her father's departure, Niki went to confront him as Jessica, claiming to remember everything he did to her, including his responsibility in her death (a memory Niki had apparently been suppressing). After assaulting him, she forced the check Hal gave Niki into his mouth and ordered him never to contact her again. Plot Genesis As of October 2006, Niki resides in Las Vegas and struggles to raise her ten-year-old son, Micah. She has been working as an internet stripper to pay the bills. Her husband, D. L. Hawkins, is in prison, accused of stealing two million dollars from a sports booker and murdering his own gang. To help pay for Micah's tuition at a very expensive school that Niki believed would encourage his gifts, Niki borrowed money from Mr. Linderman (Malcolm McDowell), a mobster who once employed her husband. Not having enough money to continue paying tuition or repay the loan, she withdraws Micah from the school. The two go on the run, as they attempt to elude thugs and police that Linderman sends after her. During times of stress, Niki begins seeing her reflection in mirrors and other reflective surfaces moving differently from herself, leading her to be concerned about her sanity. After Linderman sends two thugs to her house to collect the money she owed him, an altercation occurs, with Niki apparently blacking out after being hit by one of the thugs. When Niki recovers consciousness some time later, she is shocked to find the two thugs dead and horribly mutilated. Niki has other blackout spells over the following days, one time losing four hours, always with no recollection of what has transpired. Niki eventually realizes that she possesses another personality named Jessica, the other being far more sinister and amoral than her usual self, and which possesses superhuman strength. Niki is reunited with her husband D. L. after he escaped from jail in order to clear his name. Later, Jessica reveals that she was the one who stole the money, killed D. L.'s crew, and framed him, planning to use the money to give her son a better life and keep him away from D. L.'s influence. After a short but violent fight, in which D. L. reveals the phasing powers that he had used to escape from jail, Niki is defeated and lies unmoving on the floor while D. L. takes Micah away. The next day, Niki recovers from her injuries and confides in her friend Tina about her dreams and her alternate personality. Jessica then resurfaces and tells Tina that Niki will no longer need Tina's help. That night Jessica answers a telephone call from Micah. She persuades Micah, who knows that she is not his mother, to tell her where he and D. L. are staying. Soon after that, Jessica purchases a sniper rifle, and goes in search of D. L. and Micah. When she finally finds them, she takes aim at D. L. from a hidden location across the street and attempts to kill him. Her first shot hits D. L. in the shoulder, but Jessica is unsuccessful at killing him. After a short chase through the woods, during which Niki fights Jessica for dominance, Jessica attempts to kill D. L. again. She inadvertently throws Micah against some rocks when he tries to restrain her. Horrified, Niki regains control. She apologizes to D. L. and Micah and explains to them her problem. Niki reveals that Jessica is stronger than she is, and that as a result, she can't be trusted. Concerned that Jessica will eventually take over and put her family in danger, Niki turns herself in to the police and confesses to murder. Two weeks later, Niki is in prison, awaiting trial. She is returned to her cell after being in solitary confinement. The prison staff is very cautious, as Jessica has emerged previously and injured one of the guards during an attempted escape. During a meeting with the public defender assigned to her case, Niki is informed that the prosecution seeks the death penalty. Her lawyer asks Niki about the two million dollars, but she feigns ignorance. A rowdy Jessica then emerges to state that Niki is lying. Soon, Jessica recommends the lawyer bring in a \\"shrink\\" to analyze her apparent multiple personality disorder; Niki insists she's not crazy. Later, a meeting with D. L. and Micah indicates that D. L. gave Linderman back the two million dollars. D. L. regrets the whole situation, but Niki believes that it's for the best. She states that she still thinks of Jessica as a completely separate person and not an alter ego. Micah is very distressed by the whole situation and Niki asks the guard for permission to hug him. The guard denies her request, but Niki asks persistently, advancing on the guard as she does so. When the guard attempts to strike her with his nightstick, Niki grabs it and breaks it in half with her bare hands. She appears to be surprised after she does so, as there was no clear indication that the superhuman strength came from Jessica. A now straitjacketed Niki is sedated and placed in a room with padded walls. In \\"The Fix,\\" Niki awakes to find the straitjacket removed, the drugs wearing off, and a psychologist, Dr. Witherson, looking at her. Niki insists that while the straitjacket is useless, the drugs make Jessica weak. The psychologist isn't interested in sedating Niki further, and believes she can help Niki. Niki is visited by D. L., who used his powers to enter her room and proposes breaking her out. D. L. states that he is having trouble raising Micah alone, but Niki is still resigned to her fate. After Niki gives him a bit of advice, D. L. leaves. Later, the psychologist comes back and Niki agrees to talk to her. The psychologist insists on talking to Jessica. Niki is opposed at first, but the thought of being able to see Micah and D. L. again eventually leads her to give it a chance. Niki reminisces about her sister Jessica's piano playing abilities due to the metronome that the psychologist is using to bring Jessica out. Jessica eventually comes out and attacks the psychologist repeatedly with the Taser that the other woman brought for protection. Later, while in her padded cell, a man walks into her cell and tells her to get dressed. When asked for an explanation, he tells Niki that a death row inmate has admitted to the killings for which she was being held and that DNA evidence verifies the inmate's story. Once home, Micah is clearly ecstatic to have his mother home and asks her to play a game with him. Appearing to be his mother, Jessica replies that she would enjoy that, and Niki is shown to be hitting a mirror, begging for release. Jessica merely looks at Niki and replies, \\"You were the one who wanted to be locked up, Niki.\\" Jessica becomes Linderman's new assassin, and it is revealed that Linderman arranged to have Niki/Jessica released from prison. On Linderman's orders, Jessica kills a man by tearing him in two, throwing Matt Parkman (Greg Grunberg) out of the window in the process. (When Niki and Jessica are fighting for dominance when Jessica is about to kill the target, Matt Parkman who possesses the power of telepathy, is able to hear them both in his mind, a fact which surprises Jessica. \\"You heard Niki?\\".) Niki manages to gain control a few times. She puts the photo of Nathan Petrelli, Jessica's next target, on D. L.'s pillow, which causes D. L. to question Jessica, who is still pretending to be Niki. Jessica lies and tells him that Linderman called to ask her to be a \\"dealer\\" at the casino. Jessica kisses D. L. and assures him that it is nothing more. He leaves the room but is still suspicious. Jessica murders the two FBI agents, who are working with Nathan to take down Linderman. Later, Niki, who has managed to gain control once again, confronts Nathan in his room and confesses everything to him. She then advises Nathan to either take his family and run or to accept Linderman's offer. Nathan refuses, so Niki suggests that he kill Linderman instead. She gives Nathan a gun, which Jessica had intended to use on him. She tells Nathan that she does not have much time and begs him to knock her out so that Jessica can see that she is not in control anymore. Nathan complies. In \\".07%\\", Jessica returns home from her failed assignment only to be confronted by D. L who questions her about which personality is dominant. However, Jessica is unsure. Linderman asks if he can borrow Micah for a few hours, given that he let the debt slide and he saved her from the gas chamber. Jessica coldly informs him that Micah stays out of all their affairs, and leaves. Linderman, however, sends Candice Wilmer to impersonate Jessica and give Micah permission to go with Linderman. In \\"The Hard Part\\", Jessica and D. L. argue about their son Micah's whereabouts, and D. L. blames Jessica for his disappearance. He leaves, intending to rescue Micah without help. Niki pleads with Jessica to assist him, saying that he will die without her help. D. L. and Jessica phase through walls and into Linderman's office. They find detailed files on their whole family, including Micah. D. L. is angered to find that they had been used. The pair attempts to determine Micah's whereabouts, and find a painting of Micah in what appears to be a burning New York City. D. L. and Jessica make it to New York, where they work with Matt Parkman and Mr. Bennet to find Linderman. When D. L. and Jessica corner him, Linderman offers Jessica $20 million to kill D. L. Jessica seriously considers the offer, turning to D.L. and saying that she would kill him for that amount of money... but then she states \\"Niki wouldn't\\" and lets Niki take control once more. Niki hugs D. L. and apologizes. Linderman shoots at her but D. L. anticipates him and steps in front of Niki to protect her, taking the bullet. D. L. phases Niki out of the room after he kills Linderman. Niki then confronts Candice Wilmer, who impersonates Jessica. However, the real Jessica appears in a mirror shard to tell Niki she is not fighting her. Rather than take control, Jessica encourages Niki to fight herself and she is able to finally access her super strength as Niki and defeat Candice. Jessica then disappears from the mirror for good. As Niki later leaves the building with D. L., Molly, Mohinder, and Micah, she discovers Sylar and Peter in a showdown. When Sylar summons a parking meter with his telekinesis and strikes Peter down, Niki disarms him and slams his torso with the weapon. Peter, now capable of using Niki's super-strength, tells her to go back to her family. She does so, and then watches with D. L., Micah, and Molly Walker as Nathan flies Peter into the stratosphere to safely explode. Generations Niki faces Gina's reflection for the first time (Four Months Ago...) After the events in the season finale, Bob from The Company approaches Niki in fear other personalities may emerge. She refuses his treatment so that she can be with Micah and D. L., who survived a gunshot wound to the chest. She begins taking medication, but stops when she experiences unpleasant side effects. On what is meant to be her first day of work at a new job, Gina, a new personality, appears, sealing Niki away. When D. L. tracks down Gina in L.A., whom he believes to be Jessica, she is dancing with another man. Upon seeing D. L., Niki returns. The two begin to leave, exchanging declarations of love for each other, when the same man dancing with Gina shows up and suddenly shoots D. L., killing him. Niki and Micah then leave Las Vegas. Niki leaves Micah with Nana Dawson, a relative of D. L.'s, and travels to The Company to seek a cure for her condition. A promise of service is extracted as payment. In \\"Fight or Flight\\", she attacks a company worker and Bob, forcing Mohinder to shoot her with a Taser. When Mohinder offers to help her escape, she stops him, explaining that she came to the Company voluntarily and they are trying to help her (\\"I gave up my son to be here\\"). Later, in the episode \\"The Line\\", she joins Mohinder as his partner, claiming to be cured. When Maury Parkman mounts an assault on the Company, he manages to corrupt her by using her nightmares against her. To stop herself, she injects herself with a modified form of the Shanti virus, which is soon discovered to be immune to the antibodies in Mohinder's blood. In the present at the end of \\"Four Months Ago...\\" she is released into the general population. In \\"Truth and Consequences\\", Niki returns to Nana Dawson's house to be with Micah. One night, she gets a call from Mohinder saying he has found a cure and that he is coming to give it to her. She goes to tell Micah who is supposed to be sleeping, but finds an empty bed. In \\"Powerless\\", Micah convinces her to help save Monica from the gang that kidnapped her. Niki succeeds in rescuing Monica, but is unable to escape herself as the building explodes.  Villains  In \\"One of Us, One of Them\\", Niki is revealed to have died. In \\"I Am Become Death\\", it is revealed that Niki, Tracy Strauss, and Barbara are identical triplets that were separated at birth and had their genes modified to give them superhuman abilities. Alternate future In the graphic novel \\"Walls, Part 1\\", it is revealed that sometime after the explosion, Niki was placed in a prison for evolved humans and put under maximum security until Peter Petrelli and Hiro Nakamura rescued every prisoner, including her. She is also shown to have taken complete control over her body. Sometime after being freed in \\"Five Years Gone\\" it is revealed that her son and husband have been killed, Micah by the explosion and D. L. by Sylar. Because of this, Jessica has simply disappeared. Niki is involved in a relationship with Peter Petrelli and works as a barroom stripper under the stage name of \\"Jessica\\". She is often emotional and in pain, which only grows when she discovers that Peter caused the explosion and not Sylar, as she originally thought.  Powers and abilities  Bob Bishop in \\"Fight or Flight\\". Niki was not born with the genetic code for abilities, but was synthetically given powers under the Company's orders by Dr. Zimmerman. She has the ability of enhanced strength, allowing her to pull out the door of a safe box with her bare hands,\\"Stolen Time ,\\" sixth chapter of Heroes webcomic. throw her husband several feet across a small area with a single hit, break away from restraining cuffs that are \\"strong enough to hold down an elephant\\", and literally tear her opponents apart. She also displays signs of increased physical durability, being able to endure a blow from a shovel in \\"Fallout\\", only to stand back up again relatively unharmed, as well as able to endure the stress inflicted upon her body by her own strength (she does not, for example, injure her hand when punching through a solid wooden door). The ability is originally only used by her alter-ego, Jessica. In \\"How to Stop an Exploding Man\\", however, Niki is able to fully use her strength after some encouragement from Jessica. As a side effect of her ability, Niki has \\"alternate\\" personalities. Jessica is one of these, named after Niki's late adoptive sister. At the start of the series, Jessica surfaces during times of great stress,Episode 6: Better Halves, \\"Beaming Beeman,\\" blog of Greg Beeman, Director/Producer of Heroes. Retrieved 31 Oct 2006. but surfaces with increasing ease as the series moves on. When Jessica surfaces, the transformation is instantaneous and almost unnoticeable, but is made apparent by Niki's sudden violent and strong-willed behavior. Jessica also freely demonstrates the superhuman strength Niki has only recently unlocked. She also gains a peculiar tattoo resembling an RNA helix on her right shoulder. This helix symbol has been a recurring element in the series. Jessica seems to have been aware that she is sharing Niki's body for longer than Niki realizes, leaving notes, gifts, and instructions for Niki, and telling a thug not to \\"threaten our son.\\" Niki becomes aware of Jessica with the aid of reflective surfaces such as mirrors, and begins communicating with her. Jessica's ability to surface seems to increase over time, as Jessica is able to actively surface more often and more easily than she does in early episodes. The blackout effect on Niki also seems to lessen over time; the two personalities often directly fight each other for control and seem aware of what is said even when they are not active. It is revealed in \\"Four Months Ago...\\" that Jessica is not Niki's only personality. A third personality emerges: Gina, a pseudonym Niki assumed after she ran away to L.A. when she was younger. Whereas Jessica was originally triggered by the stresses of being a single mother and the need to protect herself and Micah, Gina seems to be a manifestation of Niki's suppressed desire to escape her responsibilities as a mother and wife.

It is now home to an outdoor Museum of Folk Architecture and Life of Ukraine. Although the origin of the toponym is uncertain, pyrohiv is genitive plural form of the Ukrainian word for pie. Location Archaeological evidence confirms that the territory of Pyrohiv has been settled at the times of the Bronze Age. Pyrohivka settlement was first mentioned in 1627, as a feudal domain of the Kyivan Cave Monastery. The 1720 records mention the village of Pyrozhov. The territory was included within the Kyiv administrative boundary in 1957. Two modern streets now go along the historic road Pyrohiv way (Pyrohivs'kyi Shlyakh): the Stolychne Shose (Capital Motorway) and Novopyrohivska (New Pyrohiv) Street.. Museum Wooden church at the Pyrohiv Museum The territory of historic Pyrohiv now serves as the location of a outdoor Museum of Folk Architecture and Life of Ukraine. Founded in 1969, the museum contains over 300 pieces of folk architecture brought here from all parts of Ukraine and carefully reassembled. The picturesque hill with several windmills is the museum centrepiece and the entire territory of the museum is divided into sectors, each representing the folk architecture and life of a specific Ukrainian region. The oldest church, situated in Pyrohiv, is Naddnipryanska, it is built in 1742. In the museum you can also find more than 40 000 items of household and traditional culture such as costumes, old textiles, embroidery, carpets, ceramics, metal handicrafts, woodwork and glass-ware as well as musical instruments, paintings and houseware. Commoner's homes, buildings of small trade, commerce and local administration, and old wooden village churches contain authentic items that represent the everyday lifestyle of Ukrainian villagers and townsfolk. Local volunteers and modern Ukrainian artisans selling their wares dress in old-style clothes and demonstrate the use of authentic everyday items to visitors. One of the main distinctive features of the museum is its theatrical performances and open-air celebrations dedicated to different folk holidays. Also in Pyrohiv you can often meet workers of the museum and visitors who are dressed in national costumes as well as those who are participating in ancient crafts like weaving, molding and others. In autumn and in summer holidays of folk crafts take place here. Blacksmiths, potters, weavers and other masters show their crafts to public and create works of art in front of your eyes. Pyrohiv museum has been accorded the status of State Museum of Ukraine and is affiliated with the Institute of Arts, Folklore and Ethnology of the National Academy of Science of Ukraine. To get to the museum from the underground station Demiivska take the trolley bus ‚Ññ11 or from the underground station Demiivska or Golosiivska the minibus taxi ‚Ññ172 and 156. The museum‚Äôs working hours are from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. There are excursions for tourists in English, Ukrainian, Russian and German. Recent controversies Fire safety is a significant concern as most of the museum's structures are wooden, and many houses have thatched roofs. In recent years, several of the museum's wooden buildings have been damaged by fires. The most recent fire on September 15, 2006 completely destroyed one house and seriously damaged two others. According to both Institute Director Hanna Skrypnyk and the Ukrainian Ministry of Emergencies, the fire was the result of arson, set to cover up the theft of a valuable collection of eighteenth-century cassoni which were exhibited in the burned building. Skrypnyk noted that in Soviet times the museum had a designated security group and fire house, which were disbanded after the Soviet collapse owing to negligence in financing on the part of the Ukrainian government. The land usage in the vicinity of the museum has become the centre of scandal as the local authorities approved several commercial construction projects, including a luxurious high-rise entertainment complex and a gasoline filling station.

(Photo courtesy of Amentaah Egyptian Arabians). Rabicano, sometimes called white ticking, is a horse coat color characterized by limited roaning in a specific pattern: its most minimal form is expressed by white hairs at the top of a horse's tail, often is expressed by additional interspersed white hairs seen first at the flank, then other parts of the body radiating out from the flank, where the white hairs will be most pronounced. Rabicano is distinct from true roan, which causes evenly interspersed white hairs throughout the body, except for solid-colored head and legs. Etymology The word \\"rabicano\\" is of Spanish origin - rabo meaning \\"tail\\" and cano meaning \\"white\\" - thus, it described a horse with white hairs in its tail.Juan de la Cruz Puig. Antologia de Poetas Argentinos,1910. pg. 131. \\"Rabicano: caballo que tiene cerdas blancas √° la ra√≠z de la cola.\\" [Rabicano: a horse that has white hairs at the root of the tail] The word appears very early in epic poems in Italian literature: Argalia, a character in Orlando Innamorato (1495), rides a horse named \\"Rabicano\\". So too does Astolfo. In Italian, the term simply means \\"roan\\" and might therefore have been a descriptive name. Characteristics This chestnut rabicano has white hairs arranged in bands or rings around the base of the tail, a trait called a coon tail or skunk tail The characteristics most often associated with the rabicano pattern are white hairs at the tailhead and the flank, where the body of the horse is joined by the hindquarters. Like other patterns and colors, the expression of the rabicano trait varies. Most of the factors affecting these variations are unknown, however, it is known that horses with a chestnut or chestnut-based coat express white patterns such as rabicano more readily; that is, they tend to have more white. Minimal expression may include a few white hairs in those areas, but is often not mentioned in descriptions of an individual horse's color. Rabicano is a white pattern that falls into the category of roaning or scattered white hairs, the genetics of which are not yet fully understood, but are apparently a different genetic mechanism from true roan. The original definition of \\"rabicano\\" referred to the presence of white hairs in the base of the tail, a characteristic called a \\"skunk\\" or coon tail. The term \\"coon tail\\" is associated with white hairs in the form of striping at the tailhead. The sides of the tail at the tailhead may have much white hair. Extensively marked rabicanos sometimes exhibit striations in their pattern on the ribs, giving them a striped appearance. Prevalence and inheritance Rabicano on a bay most often is exhibited on the mane and tail \\"Skunk tail\\" white hairs on a bay horse The rabicano pattern is thought to be a dominant gene in some families, however other forms of white ticking not following the rabicano pattern may exist and be controlled by separate mechanisms. Rabicano is present even in breeds which do not possess any true roan individuals, such as Arabian horses.Sponenberg 2003, p. 70, indicates that roan has reappeared in Thoroughbreds via a new mutation in a single horse In the Arabian, Rabicano patterning is even defined as \\"roan.\\" Rabicano may occur on any base color and may occur in conjunction with any other white pattern, including true roan or gray. Higher expression of the rabicano pattern on the flanks may produce a coat easy to mistake for true roan. However, in highly expressed rabicanos, the distribution of white hairs along the barrel may produce faint striping or stippling over the ribs, which is not seen in true roans. Furthermore, the skin of some rabicanos may be slightly mottled with pink, particularly on the abdomen and groin. This trait is not seen in true roans, and suggests that, like the white hairs associated with other white markings and patterns, the white hairs of a rabicano may be rooted in unpigmented skin cells. However, the genetic and developmental controls of such roaning are poorly understood, and has not yet been formally studied. While rabicano itself does not produce white markings on the face and legs, it can be confused with some of the numerous sabino patterns, one of which has been mapped to the KIT gene. Other color patterns mapped to KIT include tobiano and true roan. This may explain the close association between rabicano and sabino, which are often observed in the same horse. Vs. roan This horse could be either roan or rabicano; lack of white hairs on forehand and presence of skunk tail suggest rabicano, but overall body pattern is more typical of a roan. Rarely is rabicano patterning extensive enough to be confused with true roan. It is, however, possible for a horse to carry both rabicano and roan genes. Rabicanos are not true roans and can be distinguished from true roans by the following: * Roaning on rabicanos is centralized at the junction of the stifle and the flank; true roan is evenly distributed over the whole body except the points. * Rabicanos usually have skunk tails or rings of white hairs in the tail, while true roans do not. * Rabicano roaning often spreads, while true roans usually become darker. * Rabicanos do not develop corn marks when their skin is damaged. Vs. sabino Sabino patterning usually is expressed with high white legs markings with white sometimes extending onto the belly, face, and chin; sabinos often lack the white hairs at the base of the tail that characterize rabicano. A horse may carry the genes for both patterns, however.

Biography Pray Gy√∂rgy (1723‚Äì1801) t√∂rt√©net√≠r√≥, ap√°tkanonok (Vas√°rnapi √öjs√°g, 1859. szeptember 11.) He was born at √ârsek√∫jv√°r (Nov√© Z√°mky) on 11 September 1723 in a family which came from the Puster Valley in the County of Tyrol. He studied in Pressburg (present day Bratislava), entered the Society of Jesus in 1745, spent two years in the Jesuit college (St. Ann's) in the Austrian imperial capital Vienna and completed his higher studies at Nagyszombat (Trnava). He taught at Nagyv√°rad (Oradea), Trencs√©n (Trenƒç√≠n), Nagyszombat and Pressburg. In 1754 he was ordained priest and continued teaching, now in Rozsny√≥ (Ro≈æ≈àava) and in the Theresianum at Vienna, where he was professor of political science, and at the same time tutor to the princesses of Salm. He was professor in Gy≈ër (1758), Nagyszombat (1759) and Buda (1760), where he lectured, among other subjects, on moral theology. At the suppression of the Jesuits in 1773, he went to the Archdiocese of Gran and Empress Maria Theresa appointed him imperial historiographer, with a yearly income of 400 florins. When the University of Nagyszombat was transferred to Buda in 1777, Pray was given charge of the library; he resigned this position in 1780, but resumed it in 1784. During this year he surrendered his manuscripts and collection of documents to the university library for a life annuity of 400 florins. He became canon in Nagyv√°rad (Oradea) in 1790, and was sent by the chapter as its representative to the Hungarian Diet. Later he became Abbot of Tormowa. He died in Pest on 23 September 1801. Works His literary activity embraced the history of Hungary, especially the early centuries, the history of the Catholic Church in Hungary, and editing the sources of Hungarian history. He was the first to draw attention to the oldest coherent text in the Hungarian language, Funeral Sermon and Prayer (Latin title \\"Oratio funebris\\", meaning 'funeral oration'), dating probably from 1199, in a manuscript which was called after him the Pray Codex.

The genre is basically an offshoot of western popular music, particularly hip hop and funk, somewhat influenced by more traditional African music. Kapuka, genge, and bongo flava are some of the subgenres which have arisen in this style. Description and history The three countries involved in this genre share a common colonial history and close cultural and linguistic relationships. Especially since the 1960s popular musicians have shared their talents across the borders of the three nations and helped move the music of the area from traditional to benga/rumba and now Afro-urban music. Musicians of the early 1990s, including Tedd Josiah (Kenya), P-Funk (Tanzania) and Steve Jean (Uganda), began to combine western influences with the area's more traditional popular music. Local radio stations were at first reluctant to experiment with this new music, until privately operated FM stations began to appear and needed new material to establish a market niche. By 2000 urban music groups like X-plastaz (Tanzania), 237 street cypher (Kenya), and Kalamashaka (Kenya) had developed local followings and were beginning to tour abroad. Production houses specializing in the genre‚Äîsuch as Ogopa Djs, Swahili Entertainment Africa, Samawati, HipHop kila pahali, Home Boyz and Bongo Records‚Äîhave emerged. Problems with financing and technical infrastructure have hampered development, and the industry generally lacks executives well-versed in the music business. Some groups like Ukoo Flani Mau Mau, a slum-based hip hop organization with members from Kenya and Tanzania founded by the group Kalamashaka, have attempted to further development of industry with the help of Foundation UpToYouToo. In 2004 the Kilio Cha Haki, A Cry for Justice (by Nairobi Yetu) compilation appeared, featuring Rha Goddess, a performing artist and socio-political activist based in New York. Nairobi Yetu is a collaboration of 38-strong collective from Nairobi, among them G.rongi and Kalamashaka. Swahili Entertainment Inc. and Nomadic Wax Records combined in late 2004 to start the distribution and publishing of East African urban music. Other companies like Bab Kubwa and Project 254 Records are also working to develop and expand the market for this music. This upshot of this music can be well seen in the documentary HIP HOP Colony. Recent Developments and Advances The East African Urban music has recently exploded and advanced within and without the East Africa Community towards the larger African Great Lakes and in notable East African diaspora inclusive of the USA and Britain. Music artistes of this genre have been observed to develop in terms of content quality and product outreach. Some of the current most celebrated artistes include Tanzania's: Diamond Platnumz, Alikiba, Harmonize, Darasa, Aslay among others; Kenya's: Nameless, Major Kansoul; Sauti Sol; Frasha, Nadia Mukami, King Kaka among others and Uganda's Chamelion among others. With the integration of the East Africa Community, talent pool and exchange of ideas plus cooperation between artiste and music industry players of the EAC countries has improved the music scene in East Africa. However, Kenya and Tanzania have tensions and mistrust towards each other such that, both countries from time to time can shutdown and later reopen the border and thus this impedes the development of the East African Urban Music.

The springs, which are not saline (salado is Spanish for \\"salty\\"), were likely named for Salado Creek. Geography and natural history The Salado Springs are located in the Balcones Fault zone, and they reach the surface through artesian pressure by way of faults in the Cretaceous Edwards limestone. The main recharge area for the springs is probably several miles to the southwest in Williamson County, where several faults intersect with Salado Creek. The larger of the springs include Robertson Springs, Big Boiling Spring, Elm, Benedict, and Anderson springs. The latter three are located downstream (east) of the others. During the 1980s, the combined flow from all of the springs averaged approximately 122 gallons (460 liters) per second. The Balcones Fault Zone at Barton Springs is a demarcation line for certain ecological systems and species distributions. For example, the California Fan Palm, Washingtonia filifera is distributed strictly west of Barton Springs or the Balcones Fault.C. Michael Hogan. 2009 History The Salado Springs area was occupied for many years by the Tawakoni Indians, and by Paleo Indian peoples for thousands of years before that. Spanish explorer Juan Antonio Bustillo y Ceballos probably visited the springs in 1732 as he traveled westward through the region. The area was settled by Archibald Willingham in 1851 and subsequently became a well-known stage stop, as well as a stop on the Chisholm Trail. A dam was built in 1863 to power a mill, but this flooded some of the springs. A court order finally caused the dam to be lowered in 1878. References ;Sources * Gunnar Brune. 2008. * C.

Alquist (August 2, 1908 ‚Äì March 27, 2006) was a California politician. Biography Born in 1908 in Memphis, Tennessee, the son of a Swedish immigrant who worked for the railroads, Alquist was barely a teenager when he started carrying water to railroad work crews. He became a timekeeper, switchman, brakeman and conductor, before serving with the Army Air Forces during World War II. He was a yardmaster for the Southern Pacific Railroad when he and his first wife, Mai Alquist, moved to San Jose, California in 1947. Alquist was elected to the California State Assembly in 1962, and four years later, the State Senate, where he served for 30 years. A forceful and savvy state legislator, he chaired the powerful Senate Finance Committee for 15 years. He also routinely chaired the two-house conference committee that wrote the final version of the state budget before it went to the Assembly and Senate floors. He was the Democratic nominee for Lieutenant Governor of California in 1970 but was defeated by incumbent Republican Lieutenant Governor Edwin Reinecke.http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=304460 He was perhaps best known for his co-authorship of the landmark 1974 law, known as the Warren-Alquist Act, which created the California Energy Commission and became a national model. In the legislature, Alquist also helped to establish the Santa Clara County transit system, the state's earthquake safety programs OSHPD and Hospital Facilities Seismic Safety Act, HSSA, and the state Energy Commission. A pragmatic New Deal Democrat, he earned a reputation for helping the poor and representing the interests of labor. When term limits forced him to retire in 1996, he was the Legislature's ranking member. Alquist died of pneumonia in Sacramento, California, in 2006. He was 97 years old.http://www.sfgate.com/cgi- bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/03/28/BAG5IHV1FI1.DTL A state office building in downtown San Jose, which he had advocated to get built, is named for him.

The band reformed with the original line-up in 2001 and continue to tour and record. In summer 2009 Doyley hacked it and left the band. Dave Deville joined on guitar in 2009, also Ray joined on Double Bass mid 2014 .

Biography Born in Greifswald, Pomerania to English and German parents, he was later educated at Eastbourne College in Sussex, England. His family emigrated to the United States in 1885. After a youthful period in Iowa, he spent much of his life moving back and forth between London, Paris and New York. His best-known work was Their Day in Court, a 1909 book of literary and cultural commentary. His works reflect his dislike for naturalism, and disdain for the commercial tastes of the masses, promoting instead aestheticism and literary impressionism. A good friend of both Ambrose Bierce and H.L. Mencken, Mencken wrote of him warmly in the first series of his work Prejudices, comparing Pollard favorably to contemporary and fellow American aesthete James Huneker. Pollard was also noted as an early advocate of James Branch Cabell and the initial works of Robert W. Chambers. Other works include Dreams of To- day (1907), a book of decadent 'weird tales' in the vein of Chambers' the King in Yellow, the critical study Masks and Minstrels of New Germany (1911), the novels The Imitator (1901) and Lingo Dan (1903), as well as a play written in collaboration with Leo Ditrichstein, The Ambitious Mrs. Alcott, which opened and closed after 24 performances on Broadway in 1907. Pollard, aged 42, died unexpectedly from \\"brain neuritis\\" in 1911 in Baltimore, cutting short a promising career. Mencken and Bierce attended his funeral. His cremated remains were sent back to Iowa. A 1947 Ph.D. dissertation, Percival Pollard: Precursor of the Twenties, by George Nicholas Kummer of New York University, has remained in unpublished typescript form.

However, PZL Bielsko went bankrupt before it could be put into serial production.

The wing was designed by Krzysztof Kubrynski using numerical flow simulation methods (computer programs of his design).www.samolotypolskie.pl: Krzysztof Kubry≈Ñski It uses a profile belonging to the KL-002 family. For fuselage-wing interference minimization reasons, the wing is thinner at the root.\\"Skrzyd≈Ço SZD-52-2 Diana 2\\" Also, the leading and trailing edges do not follow any straight lines, necessitating a production process that depends heavily on CNC technology. The new wing offers considerably better performance at high speeds and better immunity from surface contamination. The glider also features an unusual side-stick control system to accommodate the pilot in its unusually narrow cockpit. As the maximum possible water ballast that can be carried in the wings is almost 60 kg (130 lb) heavier than the empty weight of the glider, the Diana 2 has a very large range of wing loadings, from 28 to 58 kg/m2 (5.7 to 11.9 lb/ft2).Diana Sailplanes: DIANA 2 - accessed 2008-08-26 In October 2016 Diana's IP rights for the design were passed to Polish company AVIONIC, who announces number of changes to increase performance and comfort of the flight, calling the aircraft NG (New Generation).

This is usually done with one peer being the coach while the other peer is the coachee and vice versa during a set amount of time. This technique enables each peer to receive constructive criticism, or even praise, from one another and also create a better foundation to coaching. This practice of co-coaching is especially important in the development within management and sports, as leadership skills are a priority.  Forms  There are many different forms that one can do to practice co-coaching. One form involves each individual taking turns to be coach in half hour sessions.Nemko, \\"Co-Coaching: 'I'll Coach You if You'll Coach Me'\\" With this example, the coach coaches the coachee for a half hour, while the coachee is being coached. During this time, the coach practices their coaching techniques, while the coachee ultimately gives feedback to the coach on how they are doing (both good and bad). After the coach finishes, the coach becomes the coachee and the previous coachee becomes the coach. This process of half hour sessions utilizes a quick feedback tool for self development in coaching. Even though this is one form, other forms with the basic technique of a coach and coachee are applicable so long as each person gets their turn and receives feedback from their own performance from the other individual.  Sociology  Learning from another person, and vice versa, has proven to show a sociological impact in the learning stages. As one learns in a co-coaching environment, the person may feel an ease to learning because of a much more relaxed stage, compared to that of only being coached where they may feel more pressure. Since there is an easement in this learning process, information can easily be addressed from person to person. This can have a strong impact on the person when it comes to the learning process, but also it can have its drawbacks. Since it is more relaxed coaching method, the coach is able to make more mistakes, thus having the potential to hurt or slow down the learning method. Not only can co-coaching be viewed as a sociological aspect, but it can also be categorized in the behavioral terminology as well. Since the coach and coachee are learning coaching techniques from one another, their behavior to the matter is also being altered. The easiness of each person learning and teaching each other can be an appreciated form that others may use and respond to willingly. This approach allows the user to integrate their technique into something they seem fit, while at the same time advancing their own skills and mindset as they become the coach/coachee. As one might use co-coaching as a personal learning experience, co-coaching can also be used as a tool to study people involving the learning process and a working environment. Social scientists can use co-coaching to study the sociological impact that it has to a person, or a group as a whole. As coaching presents itself as one of the key factors in success, learning the basic techniques into guiding another person is essential in the development and achievement that results in coaching. The entire learning process between coaching and learning is what social scientists deem the most important to further advance the learning of human beings on a social status. Experiments can even be done to determine the best method when dealing with co-coaching. The coach and coachee are valuable resources in understanding the correlation between the two and how each one advances each other. As one would usually prove this to be the case as in a face to face altercation, another way this technique could be distributed and tested could be that of the phone and internet. This way would furthermore advance the social science of learning in a modern-day way and could potentially create a futuristic way in the way people learn.

It was first performed in 1951 in a production directed by Marcel Cuvelier (who also played the Professor).Banham (1998, 538). Since 1957 it has been in permanent showing at Paris' Th√©√¢tre de la Huchette, on an Ionesco double-bill with The Bald Soprano.timeout Paris Th√©√¢tre de la Huchette The play is regarded as an important work in the \\"Theatre of the Absurd\\". Plot summary This play takes place in the office and dining room of a small French flat. The Professor, a man of 50 to 60, is expecting a new Pupil (aged 18). The Professor's Maid, a stout, red-faced woman of 40 to 50, worries about the Professor's health. As the absurd and nonsensical lesson progresses, the Professor grows more and more angry with what he perceives as the Pupil's ignorance, and the Pupil becomes more and more quiet and meek. Even her health begins to deteriorate, and what starts as a toothache develops into her entire body aching. At the climax of the play, after a long bout of non sequiturs (which are frequently used in Ionesco's plays), the Professor stabs and murders the Pupil. The play ends with the Maid greeting a new Pupil, taking the play full circle, back to the beginning. Adaptations The Danish choreographer Flemming Flindt adapted the play as the libretto to a score by Georges Delerue for his first ballet, The Private Lesson (Enetime) in 1963. The Professor in Flindt's adaptation is a ballet teacher.. The date of Clive Barnes' December 1965 review was given incorrectly as October 8 in the New York Times' March 12, 2009, obituary of Flindt. The ballet was commissioned by Danish television and received its 1964 stage premiere in Paris with the Royal Danish Ballet on tour. Among other companies, it is danced by the Joffrey Ballet and the leading role has been performed by Rudolf Nureyev as well as other danseurs. In 2009, PK Productions, under the direction of Patrick Kennedy staged the play at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival as a naturalistic drama.http://www.scotsman.com/news/theatre-review-the-lesson-1-766771 Notes Sources * Banham, Martin, ed. 1998.

Originally published as Alesia in 1971, it was redesigned and reissued by Avalon Hill in 1976. Jon Freeman called it \\"one of the few legends in wargaming\\" for its relatively simple rules that still result in a tense and suspenseful game. The basic concept of the game is the double siege, with Roman lines facing both inwards around Alesia, and outwards against Gallic relieving forces. The exact lines of the fortifications are preprinted on the game board; the Roman player starts by placing all the Roman counters, which may go anywhere outside Alesia, although there are advantages to placing them along the fortification lines. The Gallic player then places some counters inside Alesia, along with the counter representing Vercingetorix, and keeps the remainder offboard. There are up to 24 turns in the game, divided into two \\"Assault Periods\\" of 12 turns each, representing the two days of the battle. During each turn, the Gallic player moves on-board units, then the off-board units (showing the other player the locations but not the numbers of the units off-board), then resolves combat with adjacent Roman units. The Roman player then moves his units, and resolves the resulting combat. The object of the game is for Vercingetorix to escape from Alesia and move off the game board, in which case the Gallic player wins. If a Roman unit ever moves next to him, he is considered to have been captured, and the Romans win. Since the Romans have too few units to cover all of the double line of fortifications, and do not know exactly the numbers of the off-board units, there is considerable guesswork in trying to anticipate where the breakout might occur. At the same time, the Romans can move rapidly along the fortifications and concentrate their forces, so the Gauls must commit strongly when they decide to make their move. The original game design was Robert L. Bradley's first effort, and quite unwieldy, with a game board over four feet across, 1,000 counters, and poorly defined victory conditions. The 1971 release, characterized as a \\"semi- professional version\\" with limited sales, was a redesign that shrank the board and reduced the number of counters. After Avalon Hill acquired the game, Donald Greenwood undertook additional development, reducing the size of the board still further, and simplifying the mechanics of off-board movement.

It is the story of a mother and her six children trying to establish a home in the small fictional town of Hankston, Idaho in 1962. Synopsis Frances Lacey, a widow, works at a factory that produces potato chips. She is fired when one of the men gropes her, and she hits him in return. The same day, her son is brought home by the police, for stealing change from payphones, but they don't press charges. Shortly after this, Frances decides that Los Angeles is not the place to raise a family. She packs the kids up, sells everything they can't carry, and starts driving. She figures she'll know where she's going when she sees it. Their meager resources get them as far as Hankston, Idaho, where Frances spots the unfinished frame of a wood house a few miles outside town, across the road from Moon's Nursery. Finding that the proprietor of the nursery, Mr. Munimura, is the owner of the property, though virtually penniless, Frances proposes to buy it from him in exchange for work by her and her children, whom she collectively calls the \\"Lacey Tribe\\". With winter approaching, the Laceys work hard to make the house habitable. Frances finds a job as a waitress in the coffee shop at a bowling alley in Hankston and puts every dollar she can spare into improvement of the house. Murray inadvertently burns the house down in the dead of winter, and the family loses everything they own. The family is picking through the charred remains of the house when Frances finds their meager savings in a blackened jar. Hope is reborn for Frances, but eldest son Shayne angrily demands a reality check and even accuses her of putting her pride ahead of the family's needs. When rebuilding seems impossible, Mr. Munimura arrives with professional town folk and supplies to rebuild. Whether stubborn independent Frances likes it or not, rebuilding has started as Mr. Munimura gives her a comforting hug. Frances relents, but true to character, she states that all will be paid back. Toys, clothes, and blankets are also provided for the children. Frances only lets them build the house as far as it was before the fire. Shayne, narrating, says that it took them six months to finish the rest of the house, and four years to pay everyone back, but that it brought them all closer together as a family. Even though he hated Idaho at first, he still lives there, and has never been back to Los Angeles.

The two kinds of calcium ATPase are:nlm.nih.gov *Plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA) *Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA)  Plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA)  Rendered image of the Ca2+ pump Plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA) is a transport protein in the plasma membrane of cells that serves to remove calcium (Ca2+) from the cell. It is vital for regulating the amount of Ca2+ within cells. In fact, the PMCA is involved in removing Ca2+ from all eukaryotic cells. There is a very large transmembrane electrochemical gradient of Ca2+ driving the entry of the ion into cells, yet it is very important for cells to maintain low concentrations of Ca2+ for proper cell signalling; thus it is necessary for the cell to employ ion pumps to remove the Ca2+. The PMCA and the sodium calcium exchanger (NCX) are together the main regulators of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. Since it transports Ca2+ into the extracellular space, the PMCA is also an important regulator of the calcium concentration in the extracellular space. The PMCA belongs to a family of P-type primary ion transport ATPases that form an aspartyl phosphate intermediate. The PMCA is expressed in a variety of tissues, including the brain.  Sarcoendoplasmic Reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA)  In myocytes (muscle cells) Ca2+ is normally sequestered (isolated) in a specialized form of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) called sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). It is a Ca2+ ATPase that transfers Ca2+ from the cytosol of the cell to the lumen of the SR at the expense of ATP hydrolysis during muscle relaxation. In the skeletal muscles the calcium pump in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane works in harmony with similar calcium pumps in the plasma membrane. This ensures that the cytosolic concentration of free calcium in resting muscle is below 0.1¬µM. The sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum calcium pumps are closely related in structure and mechanism, and both are inhibited by the tumor-promoting agent thapsigargin, which does not affect the plasma membrane Ca2+ pumps.

Son of Thomas Carter, a stonemason, and his wife Anne (n√©e Thomson), Charles Carter was raised near Leicester, UK. While working as a miller for an uncle, Carter was converted to Christianity. He was baptised at Arnesby by the Rev M. Davis. He began preaching and immediately gaining acceptance amongst the Baptists of Leicestershire. Studies and aptitude He enrolled himself at Horton College in 1849 and applied himself with zeal to the study of Hebrew, Greek and logic. Such was his academic prowess that he remained without peer during his studies. He volunteered for service in India but his destination was altered to Ceylon. The change in plans was considered providential. His replacement for India perished in Delhi during the Great Mutiny. (New Zealand Baptist 1914). In addition to his Hebrew and Greek, Carter would become fluent in Sanskrit, Bengali, Tamil and Pali. His passion however, would always be Sinhalese. Upon his arrival at Point de Galle on 23 September that year, Carter set about learning Sinhalese from a 12-year-old native boy. Such was his command of the language Carter was preaching to the natives in Singalese in four months. Bishop Coppelstone, Anglican Primate of India is said to have described Carter as the \\"foremost Sinhalese scholar of this age\\". (New Zealand Baptist 1914). Missionary work In 1855 Carter entered upon his work in Kandy acting as Pastor of the Kandy Church. He also took upon missioning to the surrounding villages and coffee estates. While in service there Carter began work on a Sinhalese New Testament. In 1862 Carter was forced to New Zealand to recuperate from a throat condition. By this time his New Testament had been completed and by 1869 he had returned to Ceylon and had turned his attention to the Old Testament. By 1881 his health deteriorated again and he was forced to return to New Zealand. Literary works Extraordinarily Carter translated from the Greek and Hebrew texts, not the English. The Sinhalese work was done in vernacular language, that it could embody the divine message in a dialect that was understood by the people everywhere (Lapham 1903). His works include: *Sinhalese New Testament 1855 *Sinhalese Book of Psalms 1863 *Sinhalese Old Testament 1869 *English - Sinhalese Dictionary 1881 *Sinhalese - English Dictionary 1889 Later years Upon his retirement from missionary life, Carter became Pastor of the Ponsonby Baptist Church in New Zealand. He was the first president of the Baptist Union of New Zealand. While in retirement he compiled a Sinhalese - English dictionary and made the third revision of his Sinhalese bible, alleged by some to be one of the finest biblical translations of the day (New Zealand Baptist 1914). He also became a student of hymnology. Family Carter married Hannah Morton on 16 June 1853. They had six children and a gaggle of grandchildren. A dedicated family man, Carter delighted in his grandchildren, and instilled in them a sense of Christian duty. Books * Charles Carter. A Sinhalese- English dictionary.

Downtown is the location of many corporate or regional headquarters; city, county, state and federal government facilities; several medical centers; Indiana University ‚Äì Purdue University Indianapolis; sporting venues; performing arts venues; and most of Indianapolis' tourist attractions. Downtown is sometimes called the Mile Square, referencing the city plat developed by Alexander Ralston and Elias Pym Fordham at Indianapolis' founding. Today, Downtown encompasses about , as designated by the City of Indianapolis' Regional Center Plan. History Downtown Indianapolis in 1904. Downtown Indianapolis dates to the city's founding as the state of Indiana's new capital in 1820 near the east bank of the White River. The state legislature appointed Alexander Ralston and Elias Pym Fordham to survey and design a town plan for Indianapolis, which was platted in 1821.Hyman, p. 10, and Ralston's original plan for Indianapolis called for a town of . Nicknamed the Mile Square, the town was bounded by North, East, South, and West Streets, although they were not named at that time, with Governor's Circle, a large circular commons, at the center of town. Ralston's grid pattern with wide roads and public squares extended outward from the four blocks adjacent to the Circle, and also included four diagonal streets, later renamed as avenues.Massachusetts Street points diagonally to the northeast, Virginia Street to the southeast, Kentucky Street to the southwest, and Indiana Street to the northwest, beyond the Circle. See Browne, pp. 11, 16. Public squares were reserved for government and community use, but not all of these squares were used for this intended purpose.A revised town plat from 1831 indicated public squares were set aside for a state university (square 25) and a state hospital (square 22). See Hale, p. 10, and Hyman, p. 10. Ralston altered the grid pattern in the southeast quadrant to accommodate the flow of Pogue's Run, but a plat created in 1831 changed his original design and established a standard grid there as well.Hale, p. 79. Ralston's basic street plan is still evident in present-day Downtown Indianapolis. Streets in the original plat were named after states that were part of the United States when Indianapolis was initially planned, with the addition of Michigan, which was a U.S. territory at that time. Tennessee and Mississippi Streets were renamed Capitol and Senate Avenues in 1895, after several state government buildings were built west of the Circle near the Indiana Statehouse. There are a few other exceptions to the early street names. The National Road, which eventually crossed Indiana into Illinois, passes through Indianapolis along Washington Street, a east-west street (more recently converted into a one-way westbound street west of New Jersey Street) located one block south of the Circle. Meridian and Market Streets intersect the Circle. Few street improvements were made in the 1820s and 1830s; sidewalks did not appear until 1839 or 1840.Brown, p. 25, and Browne, pp. 9‚Äì10, 17. President Lyndon B. Johnson addresses a crowd on Monument Circle in 1966. In the last half of the nineteenth century, when the city's population soared from 8,091 in 1850 to 169,164 in 1900, urban development expanded in all directions as Indianapolis experienced a building boom and transitioned from an agricultural community to an industrial center.Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., pp. 1481, 1486; Brown, p. 16; and Some of the city's most iconic structures were built during this period, including several that have survived to the present day in Downtown: the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument (1888, dedicated 1902), the Indiana Statehouse (1888), Union Station (1888), and the Das Deutsche Haus (1898), among others.Major structures constructed during this era that have been demolished include Tomlinson Hall (1883‚Äì86), a civic auditorium at Delaware and Market Street, and English's Opera House and Hotel (1880; 1884, 1896) on Monument Circle, among others. See Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., pp. 546‚Äì47; 1336‚Äì37. Following World War II, expansion of the American middle class, suburbanization, and declining manufacturing employment greatly impacted Downtown Indianapolis, similar to most U.S. central business districts at this time. Urban renewal projects of this era hastened the central business district's decline, particularly the clearance of working-class neighborhoods for construction of Interstate 65 and Interstate 70 in the 1960s. The extension schools of Indiana University and Purdue University merged in 1969, creating Indiana University ‚Äì Purdue University Indianapolis and its urban campus near Indiana Avenue. Market Square Arena opened in 1974 as home to the National Basketball Association (NBA) Indiana Pacers. The Hoosier Dome and newly dedicated Pan American Plaza in 1988. Downtown became the center of Indianapolis' aggressive sports tourism branding strategy. Throughout the 1980s, $122 million in public and private funding built the Indianapolis Tennis Center, Indiana University Natatorium, Carroll Track and Soccer Stadium, and the Hoosier Dome (later renamed the RCA Dome). The latter project secured the 1984 relocation of the NFL Baltimore Colts, the 1987 Pan American Games, and scores of subsequent athletic events of national and international interest. Modern skyscraper construction catapulted Downtown office and commercial development in the 1980s. A building boom, lasting from 1982 to 1990, saw the construction of six of the city's ten tallest buildings. These include OneAmerica Tower (1982), Fifth Third Bank Tower (1983), Capital Center South Tower (1987), BMO Plaza (1988), Market Tower (1988), 300 North Meridian (1989), and the tallest, Salesforce Tower (1990). Reinvestment continued through the 1990s, including development of White River State Park museums and attractions, Canal Walk, Circle Centre Mall (1995), Victory Field (1996), and Bankers Life Fieldhouse (1999). Downtown Indianapolis contains 36 apartment buildings that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places in the Apartments and Flats of Downtown Indianapolis Thematic Resources. Geography Aerial of downtown Indianapolis, looking southwest. The photo depicts the central business district (center), with landmarks including the White River (top), IUPUI (top right), White River State Park (top center), and Lucas Oil Stadium (top left). The boundaries of Downtown Indianapolis have varied over time as the city has grown. The city's original platted area, known as the Mile Square and bounded by North, South, East, and West streets, is sometimes used to denote the downtown area. However, the Regional Center Plan designated by the City of Indianapolis Department of Metropolitan Development defines the boundaries to be 16th Street on the north, Interstate 65/70 on the east, Interstate 70 on the south, and the Belt Railroad on the west, enclosing an area of . Downtown Indianapolis is situated on flat land near the confluence of the White River and Fall Creek. Pogue's Run, a smaller tributary of the White River, flows beneath Downtown. The waterway was channeled into a sanitary tunnel in 1914. Cityscape According to Downtown Indy, Inc., the number of apartment units in Downtown has increased 61 percent from 2011 to 2015, with more than 50 percent of new development occurring inside the Mile Square. Likewise, Downtown's 2010 residential population of 17,589 is expected to more than double to 34,000 by 2018.

It was also the official calendar of the Byzantine Empire from 988 to 1453 and of Kievan Rus' and Russia from c. 988 to 1700, as well as being used in other areas of the Byzantine commonwealth such as in Serbia. Since Byzantine is a historiographical term, the original name uses the adjective \\"Roman\\" as it was what the Eastern Roman Empire continued calling itself. The calendar was based on the Julian calendar, except that the year started on 1 September and the year number used an Anno Mundi epoch derived from the Septuagint version of the Bible. It placed the date of creation at 5509 years before the incarnation, and was characterized by a certain tendency which had already been a tradition among Jews and early Christians to number the years from the calculated foundation of the world (Latin: Annus Mundi or Ab Origine Mundi‚Äî \\"AM\\"). Its Year One, marking the supposed date of creation, was September 1, 5509 BC, to August 31, 5508 BC. This would make the current year (AD ) ( before September 1; and after September 1). History Creation of Adam and Eve (Russian icon, 18th c.) The first appearance of the term is in the treatise of a monk and priest, Georgios (AD 638‚Äì39), who mentions all the main variants of the \\"World Era\\" in his work.Fr. Diekamp, \\"Der M√∂nch und Presbyter Georgios, ein unbekannter Schriftsteller des 7. Jahrhunderts\\", Byzantinische Zeitschrift 9 (1900) 14‚Äì51.Pavel Kuzenkov (Moscow). \\"How old is the World?

Georgios argues that the main advantage of the World era is the common starting point of the astronomical lunar and solar cycles, and of the cycle of indictions, the usual dating system in Byzantium since the 6th century. He also regarded it as the most convenient for the Easter computus. Complex calculations of the 19-year lunar and 28-year solar cycles within this world era allowed scholars to discover the cosmic significance of certain historical dates, such as the birth or the crucifixion of Jesus.Prof. Dr. Marcus Louis Rautman . \\"Time.\\" In Daily Life in the Byzantine Empire. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006. pp. 7 This date underwent minor revisions before being finalized in the mid-7th century, although its precursors were developed c. AD 412. By the second half of the 7th century, the Creation Era was known in Western Europe, at least in Great Britain. By the late 10th century (around AD 988), when the era appears in use on official government records, a unified system was widely recognized across the Eastern Roman world. The era was ultimately calculated as starting on September 1, and Jesus was thought to have been born in the year 5509 since the creation of the world.Paul Stephenson. \\"Translations from Byzantine Sources: The Imperial Centuries, c.700‚Äì1204: John Skylitzes, \\"Synopsis Historion\\": The Year 6508, in the 13th Indiction: the Byzantine dating system\\". November 2006. Historical time was thus calculated from the creation, and not from Christ's birth as it was in the west after the Anno Domini system adopted between the 6th and 9th centuries. The eastern Church avoided the use of the Anno Domini system of Dionysius Exiguus, since the date of Christ's birth was debated in Constantinople as late as the 14th century. The Byzantine calendar was identical to the Julian calendar except that: * the names of the months were transcribed from Latin into Greek; * the first day of the year was September 1, so that both the ecclesiastical and civil calendar years ran from 1 September to 31 August, (see Indiction), which to the present day is the Eastern Orthodox church year; * dates were seldom, if ever, reckoned according to the kalends (, kalanda√≠), nones (, n≈çna√≠), and ides (, eido√≠) of the months in the Roman manner, but simply numbered from the beginning of the month in the Greek,. Syrian,. and Egyptian manner, and, * its era was based on the year of creation, reckoned September 1, 5509 BC, to August 31, 5508 BC, rather than the foundation of Rome; years were also reckoned by their place in the indiction and not by the years' consuls. The leap day of the Byzantine calendar was obtained in an identical manner to the bissextile day of the original Roman version of the Julian calendar, by doubling the sixth day before the calends of March, i.e., by doubling 24 February. The Byzantine World Era was gradually replaced in the Orthodox Church by the Christian Era (Anno Domini), which was utilized initially by Patriarch Theophanes I Karykes in 1597, afterwards by Patriarch Cyril Lucaris in 1626, and then formally established by the Church in 1728. Meanwhile, as Russia received Orthodox Christianity from Byzantium, she inherited the Orthodox calendar based on the Byzantine Era (translated into Slavonic). After the collapse of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, the era continued to be used by Russia, which witnessed millennialist movements in Moscow in AD 1492 (7000 AM). It was only in AD 1700 that the Byzantine calendar in Russia was changed to the Julian calendar by Peter the Great.Prof. Charles Ellis (University of Bristol). Russian Calendar (988‚Äì1917). The Literary Encyclopedia. 25 September 2008. It still forms the basis of traditional Orthodox calendars up to today. September AD 2000 began the year 7509 AM. The age of the world God as architect of the world (frontispiece of Bible moralis√©e, c. 1220‚Äì1230) The earliest extant Christian writings on the age of the world according to the biblical chronology are by Theophilus (AD 115‚Äì181) in his apologetic work To Autolycus,Theophilus of Antioch. Theophilus of Antioch to Autolycus. Book III. Chap XXIV (Chronology from Adam) ‚Äì Chap. XXVIII (Leading Chronological Epochs). and by Julius Africanus (AD 200‚Äì245) in his Five Books of Chronology.Julius Africanus. Extant Writings III. The Extant Fragments of the Five Books of the Chronography of Julius Africanus. Both of these early Christian writers, following the Septuagint version of the Old Testament, determined the age of the world to have been about 5,530 years at the birth of Christ.Fr. Seraphim Rose. GENESIS, CREATION and EARLY MAN: The Orthodox Christian Vision. St. Herman of Alaska Brotherhood, Platina, California, 2000. p. 236. Ben Zion Wacholder points out that the writings of the Church Fathers on this subject are of vital significance (even though he disagrees with their chronological system based on the authenticity of the Septuagint, as compared to that of the Masoretic Text), in that through the Christian chronographers a window to the earlier Hellenistic biblical chronographers is preserved: The Hellenistic Jewish writer Demetrius the Chronographer (flourishing 221‚Äì204 BC) wrote On the Kings of Judea which dealt with biblical exegesis, mainly chronology; he computed the date of the flood and the birth of Abraham exactly as in the Septuagint, and first established the Annus Adami (Era of Adam), the antecedent of the Hebrew World Era, and of the Alexandrian and Byzantine Creation Eras. Alexandrian Era The Alexandrian Era (, K√≥smou √©tƒì kat'Alexandre√Æs) developed in AD 412, was the precursor to the Byzantine Era. After the initial attempts by Hippolytus, Clement of Alexandria and others, the Alexandrian computation of the date of creation was worked out to be 25 March 5493 BC.Elias J. Bickerman. Chronology of the Ancient World. 2nd edition. Cornell University Press. 1980. p. 73. The Alexandrine monk Panodorus reckoned 5904 years from Adam to the year AD 412. His years began with August 29, corresponding to the First of Thoth, the Egyptian new year.Rev. Philip Schaff (1819‚Äì1893), Ed. \\"Era.\\" Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge. New Edition, 13 Vols., 1908‚Äì14. Vol. 4, pp. 163. Annianos of Alexandria however, preferred the Annunciation style as New Year's Day, 25 March, and shifted the Panodorus era by about six months, to begin on 25 March. This created the Alexandrian Era, whose first day was the first day of the proleptic Alexandrian civil year in progress, 29 August 5493 BC, with the ecclesiastical year beginning on 25 March 5493 BC. Dionysius of Alexandria had earlier emphatically quoted mystical justifications for the choice of March 25 as the start of the year: The Alexandrian Era of March 25, 5493 BC was adopted by church fathers such as Maximus the Confessor and Theophanes the Confessor, as well as chroniclers such as George Syncellus. Its striking mysticism made it popular in Byzantium, especially in monastic circles. However this masterpiece of Christian symbolism had two serious weak points: historical inaccuracy surrounding the date of the resurrection of Jesus as determined by its Easter computus, and its contradiction to the chronology of the Gospel of St John regarding the date of the crucifixion of Jesus on Friday after the Passover. Chronicon Paschale, Venetian edition of 1729 Chronicon Paschale A new variant of the World Era was suggested in the Chronicon Paschale, a valuable Byzantine universal chronicle of the world, composed about the year 630 AD by some representative of the Antiochian scholarly tradition. It had for its basis a chronological list of events extending from the creation of Adam to the year AD 627. The chronology of the writer is based on the figures of the Bible and begins with 21 March, 5507. For its influence on Greek Christian chronology, and also because of its wide scope, the Chronicon Paschale takes its place beside Eusebius, and the chronicle of the monk Georgius SyncellusGeorge Synkellos.

In The Catholic Encyclopedia (New Advent). New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. By the late 10th century, the Byzantine Era, which had become fixed at September 1 5509 BC since at least the mid-7th century (differing by 16 years from the Alexandrian date, and 2 years from the Chronicon Paschale), had become the widely accepted calendar of choice par excellence for Chalcedonian Orthodoxy. Accounts in Church Fathers John Chrysostom says in his Homily \\"On the Cross and the Thief\\", that Christ \\"opened for us today Paradise, which had remained closed for some 5000 years.\\"St. John Chrysostom. Homily \\"On the Cross and the Thief\\" 1:2. Isaac the Syrian writes in a Homily that before Christ \\"for five thousand years five hundred and some years God left Adam (i.e. man) to labor on the earth.\\"St. Isaac the Syrian. Homily 19, Russian edition, pp. 85 [Homily 29, English edition, p. 143]. Augustine of Hippo writes in the City of God (written AD 413‚Äì426): : \\"Let us omit the conjectures of men who know not what they say when they speak of the nature and origin of the human race...They are deceived by those highly mendacious documents which profess to give the history of many thousands of years, though reckoning by the sacred writings we find that not 6,000 years have passed. (City of God 12:10).\\"Fr. Seraphim Rose. GENESIS, CREATION and EARLY MAN: The Orthodox Christian Vision. St. Herman of Alaska Brotherhood, Platina, California, 2000. pp. 236. Augustine goes on to say that the ancient Greek chronology \\"does not exceed the true account of the duration of the world as it is given in our documents (i.e. the Scriptures), which are truly sacred.\\" Hippolytus of Rome (c. 170‚Äì235) maintained on Scriptural grounds that Jesus's birth took place in 5500 AM, and held that the birth of Christ took place on a passover day, deducing that its month-date was 25 MarchGeorge Ogg. \\"Hippolytus and the Introduction of the Christian Era\\". in Vigiliae Christianae, Vol.16, No.1 (Mar. 1962), p. 4-6. (see Alexandrian Era). He gave the following intervals: :\\"...from Adam to the flood 2242 years, thence to Abraham 1141 years, thence to the Exodus 430 years, thence to the passover of Joshua 41 years, thence to the passover of Hezekiah 864 years, thence to the passover of Josiah 114 years, thence to the passover of Ezra 107 years, and thence to the birth of Christ 563 years.\\" In his Commentary on Daniel, one of his earlier writings, he proceeds to set out additional reasons for accepting the date of 5500 AM: :\\"First he quotes Exod. xxv. 10f. and pointing out that the length, breadth and height of the ark of the covenant amount in all to 5¬Ω cubits, says that these symbolize the 5,500 years from Adam at the end of which the Saviour was born. He then quotes from Jn. xix. 14 ' it was about the sixth hour ' and, understanding by that 5¬Ω hours, takes each hour to correspond to a thousand years of the world's life...\\" Around AD 202 Hippolytus held that Jesus was born in the 42nd year of the reign of Augustus and that he was born in 5500AM. In his Commentary on Daniel he did not need to establish the precise year of Jesus's birth; he is not concerned about the day of the week, the month-date, or even the year; it was sufficient for his purpose to show that Christ was born in the days of Augustus in 5500 AM. Accounts in Byzantine authors From Justinian's decree in AD 537 that all dates must include the Indiction, the unification of the theological date of creation (as yet unfinalized) with the administrative system of Indiction cycles became commonly referred to amongst Byzantine authors, to whom the indiction was the standard measurement of time. In official documents In the year AD 691, we find the Creation Era in the Acts of the Quinisext Council: We find the era also in the dating of the so-called Letter of three Patriarchs to the emperor Theophilos (April, indiction 14, 6344 = AD 836). By the 10th century the Byzantine Era is found in the Novellas of AD 947, 962, 964, and most surely of the year AD 988, all dated in this way, as well as the Act of Patriarch Nicholaos II Chrysobergos in AD 987. John Skylitzes' (c. 1081‚Äì1118) major work is the Synopsis of Histories, which covers the reigns of the Byzantine emperors from the death of Nicephorus I in 811 to the deposition of Michael IV in 1057; it continues the chronicle of Theophanes the Confessor. Quoting from him as an example of the common Byzantine dating method, he refers to emperor Basil, writing that: Niketas Choniates (c. 1155‚Äì1215), sometimes called Acominatus, was a Byzantine Greek historian. His chief work is his History, in twenty-one books, of the period from 1118 to 1207. Again, an example of the dating method can be seen as he refers to the fall of Constantinople to the fourth crusade as follows: The historian Doukas, writing c. AD 1460, makes a detailed account for the Creation Era. Although unrefined in style, the history of Doukas is both judicious and trustworthy, and it is the most valuable source for the closing years of the Byzantine empire. > From Adam, the first man created by God, to Noah, at whose time the flood > took place, there were ten generations.

Byzantine mindset Literal creation days Even the most mystical Fathers such as St. Isaac the Syrian accepted without question the common understanding of the Church that the world was created \\"more or less\\" in 5,500 BC. As Fr. Seraphim Rose points out: :\\"The Holy Fathers (probably unanimously) certainly have no doubt that the chronology of the Old Testament, from Adam onwards, is to be accepted \\"literally.\\" They did not have the fundamentalist's over-concern for chronological precision, but even the most mystical Fathers (St. Isaac the Syrian, St. Gregory Palamas, etc.) were quite certain that Adam lived literally some 900 years, that there were some 5,500 years (\\"more or less\\") between the creation and the Birth of Christ.\\"Fr. Seraphim Rose. GENESIS, CREATION and EARLY MAN: The Orthodox Christian Vision. St. Herman of Alaska Brotherhood, Platina, California, 2000. pp. 539‚Äì540. For early Christians, the creation of the world was neither a matter of dogma nor a cosmological problem. As part of a history centered on Man, it was a divine act whose reality was beyond any doubt.Richet, Pascal. \\"The Creation of the world and the birth of chronology\\". Comptes Rendus Geoscience. Volume 349, Issue 5, September 2017, p. 228. Hours of the liturgical day In the Byzantine period, the day was divided into two 12-hour cycles fixed by the rising and setting of the sun. : \\"Following Roman custom, the Byzantines began their calendrical day (nychthemeron) at midnight with the first hour of day (hemera) coming at dawn. The third hour marked midmorning, the sixth hour noon, and the ninth hour midafternoon. Evening (hespera) began at the 11th hour, and with sunset came the first hour of night (apodeipnon). The interval between sunset and sunrise (nyx) was similarly divided into 12 hours as well as the traditional \\"watches\\" (vigiliae) of Roman times.\\"Prof. Dr. Marcus Louis Rautman . \\"Time.\\" In Daily Life in the Byzantine Empire. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006. pp. 3 Days of the liturgical week Marcus Rautman points out that the seven-day week was known throughout the ancient world. The Roman Calendar had assigned one of the planetary deities to each day of the week. The Byzantines naturally avoided using these Latin names with their pagan echoes. They began their week with the \\"Lord's Day\\" (Kyriake), followed by an orderly succession of numbered days: Deutera (\\"2nd\\"), Trite (\\"3rd\\"), Tetarte (\\"4th\\"), and Pempte (\\"5th\\"), a day of \\"preparation\\" (Paraskeve), and finally Sabatton.Prof. Dr. Marcus Louis Rautman . \\"Time.\\" In Daily Life in the Byzantine Empire. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006. pp. 5 Each day was devoted to remembering one event of the life of Christ or the Theotokos or several martyrs or saints, whose observed feast days gradually eclipsed traditional festivals. Kyriake was seen as the day of resurrection of Christ and as both the first and eighth day of the week, in the same way that Christ was the alpha and omega of the cosmos, existing both before and after time. The second day of the week recognized angels, \\"the secondary luminaries as the first reflections of the primal outpouring of light\\", just as the sun and the moon had been observed during the Roman week. John the Baptist, the forerunner (Prodromos) of Christ, was honored on the third day. Both the second and third days were viewed as occasions for penitence. The fourth and sixth days were dedicated to the Cross. The fourth day to the Theotokos and her mourning of the loss of her son and the sixth day (the Paraskeue) as the day of the Crucifixion of the Lord, with holy songs sung and fasting in remembrance of these events. St. Nicholas was honored on the fifth day of the week, while the Sabatton day was set aside for the saints and all the deceased faithful. This order is still in use in the Orthodox Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches. A special arrangement of the way in which the hymns were sung was set for each day of the eight-week cycle, the \\"Octoechos (liturgy)\\". This cycle begins on the first Sunday after Easter (\\"Thomas-Sunday\\") and contains the texts whose content represents the meaning of the days of the week. The hymns sung on these eight weeks were performed with the use of eight different modes also called Octoechoi.Panteli, Maria; Purwins, Hendrik (2013). \\"A Quantitative Comparison of Chrysanthine Theory and Performance Practice of Scale Tuning, Steps, and Prominence of the Octoechos in Byzantine Chant\\". Journal of New Music Research. 42 (3): 205‚Äì221. Historical perspective and cognitive framework * According to the Orthodox Study Bible: :Regarding questions about the scientific accuracy of the Genesis account of creation, and about various viewpoints concerning evolution, the Orthodox Church has not dogmatized any particular view. What is dogmatically proclaimed is that the One Triune God created everything that exists, and that man was created in a unique way and is alone made in the image and likeness of God (Gn 1:26,27).Orthodox Study Bible. St. Athanasius Academy of Orthodox Theology. Elk Grove, California, 2008. p. 2. :The opening words of the Nicene Creed, the central doctrinal statement of Christianity, affirms that the One True God is the source of everything that exists, both physical and spiritual, both animate and inanimate: \\"We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth, and of all things visible and invisible.\\" In addition, our regeneration in Christ and the resurrection of the dead are both often called the \\"New Creation\\" (2 Cor 5:17; Rev 21:1).The Orthodox Study Bible. St. Athanasius Academy of Orthodox Theology. Elk Grove, California, 2008. p. 1778. * According to Fr. Stanley Harakas, the Bible's description of creation is not a \\"scientific account\\". It is not read for scientific knowledge but for spiritual truth and divine revelation. The physical-scientific side of the origins of mankind, though important, is really quite secondary in significance to the Church's message. The central image of Adam as God's image and likeness, who also represents fallen and sinful humanity, and the new Adam, Jesus Christ, who is the \\"beginning\\", the first-born of the dead (Colossians 1:18) and the \\"first-fruits\\" of those who were dead, and are now alive (1 Corinthians 15:20‚Äì23), is what is really important.Fr. Stanley S. Harakas. The Orthodox Church: 455 Questions and Answers. Light & Life Publishing, Minneapolis, 1988. pp. 88,91. * Protopresbyter Dr. Doru Costache affirms in \\"The Orthodox Doctrine of Creation in the Age of Science\\" (2019), that Orthodox Christianity has never issued a dogma of creation that establishes in normative terms its relevant convictions, even though it does possess a strong sense of the cosmos, developing a theology of the world. While not specifically discussing the chronology of the Byzantine Calendar as such, he explains that the Orthodox doctrine of creation is largely compatible with the contemporary scientific representation of reality, also suggesting that the Christian doctrine of creation should preserve its capacity to be redrafted when the cultural environment changes. He states that modern creationism has originated in milieus that are foreign to the Orthodox worldview, and there is no record of a wholesale rejection of culture in the patristic tradition. Rather, from the outset of its historical emergence, Orthodox theology has traditionally interacted with the available sciences and the cultural frameworks of the past. The ongoing contextualization, particularly in relation to scientific culture, remained the norm for most of the Byzantine era, which was a time of prodigious research, cultural cross pollination, and innovation. In contrast with contemporary creationism, which construes a recently made world, molded exclusively by God out of an inert matter deprived of natural energy and capacity for movement, the Orthodox theology of creation traditionally advocates a distinction between the divine acts of creation, and organization. He argues that the supernaturalist worldview of creationism was discarded indirectly by the Orthodox Church in the seventh century as monoenergism. Thus he aligns with the view of an expanding universe whose history began billions of years ago, a universe characterized by homogeneity, movement, change, and complexity.Costache, Doru.

Khramov (Ph.D.) examines the relationship between Christian faith and evolutionary theory in \\"Fitting Evolution into Christian Belief: An Eastern Orthodox Approach\\" (2017).Khramov, Alexander V. (2017). \\"Fitting Evolution into Christian Belief: An Eastern Orthodox Approach.\\" International Journal of Orthodox Theology 8:1: 75-105. urn:nbn:de:0276-2017-1053. In defining the basic cognitive framework by which we are to approach this subject, he begins by noting that those who have striven to reconcile one system with the other have usually resorted to theistic evolution (TE) almost without exception ‚Äì the idea that God employed an evolutionary process to create the Universe and living things. However, if we look instead at the problem from the point of view of Greek patristic thought, we see a very different way of fitting evolution into Christian belief. By referring to the writings of the Church Fathers including Gregory of Nyssa and Gregory the Theologian, he states that what matters most is not the _process_ of creation, but rather how the Church Fathers understood its _result_. The basic premise described is that God did not create humans in their present bodily condition; but rather prelapsarian human beings (i.e. before the Fall of man) had spiritual bodies and lived a kind of angelic life; humans entered the organismic life and entered 'time' itself only after the Fall, which happened before the beginning of the empirically known universe. Therefore it is entirely reasonable to suppose that evolution itself started in the fallen world; and Theistic evolutionists have no warrant to equate the earliest members of Homo sapiens with those humans who were created by God on the sixth day for life in paradise. The six days of creation and other events preceding the expulsion from Paradise simply lie beyond what science can discover. So \\"Moses's Book\\" possesses its own truth, independent of what scientists can say about the observable world. There can be no reason for conflict. * Professor Fr. Arsenius John Baptist Vuibert (S.S.), a 19th-century historian, observed that Biblical Chronologies are uncertain due to discrepancies in the figures in Genesis and other methodological factors, accounting for hundreds of different chronologies being assigned by historians. In the case of the Fathers of the Sixth Ecumenical Council, who assigned 5509 BC. as the date of the creation of man, he writes that it was in response to the emperor's wishes to fix an era or convenient starting point for historical computation. Therefore, it was a decision of mere historical convenience, not respecting either faith or morals, which are what is truly of intrinsic value in the Scriptures.Prof. Fr. Arsenius John Baptist Vuibert (S.S.). An Ancient History: From the Creation to the Fall of the Western Empire in A.D. 476. Baltimore: Foley, 1886. p. 21. Having made this disclaimer, he settles on the Benedictine Chronology of 4963 BC for the purposes of his history. * According to the ninth edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, regarding the so-called Era of the Creation of the World, asserted in the preface to his Chronologie de l‚ÄôHistoire Sainte (Chronology of Sacred History, Berlin 1738), that he collected upwards of two-hundred different calculations, the shortest of which reckons only 3483 years between the creation of the world and the commencement of the vulgar era and the longest 6984. The so-called era of the creation of the world is therefore a purely conventional and arbitrary epoch, for which the very nature of the case discussion is hopeless labour.Thomas Spencer Baynes. \\"Chronology: Era of the Creation of the World.\\" The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, and general literature. 9th Ed., Vol. 5. (A. & C. Black, 1833. p. 713.) * It may also be noted historically that while Byzantine officials and chroniclers were disconcerted by the ambiguities among the different dating and recording systems in the earlier centuries, these mattered little to most people who marked time by the orderly progression of agricultural seasons and church festivals, and by the regularity of holidays, weather cycles, and years that revealed the Divine order (Taxis) underlying the world.Prof. Dr. Marcus Louis Rautman . \\"Time.\\" In Daily Life in the Byzantine Empire. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006. pp. 8 Summary As the Greek and Roman methods of computing time were connected with certain pagan rites and observances, Christians began at an early period to adopt the Hebrew practice of reckoning their years from the supposed period of the creation of the world. Currently the two dominant dates for creation that exist using the biblical model, are about 5500 BC and about 4000 BC. These are calculated from the genealogies in two versions of the Bible, with most of the difference arising from two versions of Genesis. The older dates of the Church Fathers in the Byzantine Era and in its precursor, the Alexandrian Era, are based on the Greek Septuagint. The later dates of the Ussher chronology and the Hebrew Calendar are based on the Hebrew Masoretic Text. The Fathers were well aware of the discrepancy of some hundreds of years between the Greek and Hebrew Old Testament chronology, and it did not bother them; they did not quibble over years or worry that the standard calendar was precise \\"to the very year\\"; it is sufficient that what is involved is beyond any doubt a matter of some few thousands of years, involving the lifetimes of specific men, and it can in no way be interpreted as millions of years or whole ages and races of men.Fr. Seraphim Rose. GENESIS, CREATION and EARLY MAN: The Orthodox Christian Vision. St. Herman of Alaska Brotherhood, Platina, California, 2000. pp. 602‚Äì603. To this day, traditional Orthodox Christians will use the Byzantine calculation of the World Era in conjunction with the Anno Domini (AD) year. Both dates appear on Orthodox cornerstones, ecclesiastical calendars and formal documents. The ecclesiastical new year is still observed on September 1 (or on the Gregorian Calendar's September 14 for those churches which follow the Julian Calendar). September 2019 marked the beginning of the year 7528 of this era.

He clerked for Judge Peirson Mitchell Hall of the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, and enlisted in the United States Air Force in 1956 where he spent two years in the JAG Corps. He then went to work as an Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of California from 1958 to 1960, and was in private practice in Los Angeles for the next seven years. President Lyndon B. Johnson named him United States Attorney for the Central District of California in 1967. In 1970, Richard Nixon appointed him executive director of the President's Commission on Campus Unrest. He was also an adjunct professor at Loyola Law School. Federal judicial service On April 21, 1971, President Richard Nixon nominated Byrne to a new seat on the United States District Court for the Central District of California created by 84 Stat. 294. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on May 20, and received his commission the same day. Byrne served as Chief Judge from 1994 to 1998. He assumed senior status on February 28, 1998.

In the midst of the trial, several twists served to destroy the government's case. The first revelation came on April 26, 1973, when the government prosecutor disclosed that White House operatives had burgled the Beverly Hills office of Ellsberg's psychiatrist. The burglars, led by G. Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt, were not apprehended until after they burgled the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington nine months later. Days after the disclosure, Richard Nixon's two top lieutenants, John Ehrlichman and H.R. Haldeman, resigned, and White House counsel John Dean was fired. A few days later, Byrne disclosed in court that Ehrlichman had offered him the position of FBI director. On May 9, Byrne learned of yet another illegality: the FBI had secretly taped phone conversations between Ellsberg and Morton Halperin, who had supervised the Pentagon Papers study. Finally, when the government claimed it had lost all records of the wiretapping, Byrne declared a mistrial on May 11, 1973. It was later learned that while Byrne was presiding over the pending Ellsberg trial, John D. Ehrlichman met with Byrne to discuss the judge's becoming director of the FBI. Byrne met with Ehrlichman at the Western White House to talk about this possible appointment. According to Ehrlichman's later testimony Byrne was eager for the appointment.July 25, 1973 transcript of testimony by John D. Ehrlichman before the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities Neither Byrne nor Ehrlichman revealed this discussion about the FBI directorship to the litigants in the Ellsberg case until his visit was discovered by the press.

Due to the rarity of the disorder, tiopronin falls under the classification of an orphan drug. It is somewhat similar to penicillamine in both chemistry and pharmacology. Uses Tiopronin is used primarily for cystinuria and is well known in the cystinuric community. Depending on the severity of a person's cystinuria, tiopronin may be taken for life, possibly starting in early childhood. The drug works by reacting with urinary cysteine to form a more soluble, disulfide linked, tiopronin-cysteine complex. It may also be used for Wilson's disease (an overload of copper in the body), and has also been investigated for the treatment of arthritis, though tiopronin is not an anti- inflammatory. Tiopronin is also sometimes used as a stabilizing agent for metal nanoparticles. The thiol group binds to the nanoparticles, preventing coagulation. Side effects Tiopronin may present a variety of side effects, which are broadly similar to those of D-penicillamine and other compounds containing active sulfhydryl groups. Its pharmacokinetics have been studied.

The encyclopedia of Indianapolis. p. 372. The neighborhood began as a farming settlement in the 1840s near what is now the intersection of 38th Street and Illinois Street. The settlement was called Mapleton due to the large number of maple trees in the area. 38th Street which now forms the southern boundary of the neighborhood was originally called Maple Road.Bodenhamer, David; Barrows, Robert (1994). \\"Butler‚ÄìTarkington\\". The encyclopedia of Indianapolis. p. 372. The settlement was connected to the railway system of the City of Indianapolis in the 1860s. In 1890, the city's electric street car system ran a line up through the neighborhood. Mapleton was annexed by Indianapolis in 1902, and most of the rest of the neighborhood was annexed by 1906. Residential development took off in the 1910s and 1920s. By the end of World War II, the neighborhood was built-out. The neighborhood was almost exclusively white up until the mid-1950s when African-Americans began moving into the southwest portion of the neighborhood. The Butler‚ÄìTarkington Neighborhood Association was formed in 1956 to help foster community and ease the tensions resulting from racial integration of the neighborhood. Today, one-third of the residents are African-American. The community continues to be seen as an example of successful neighborhood integration. The neighborhood consists mainly of working to upper-middle-class households, with wealthier households inhabiting the much grander homes along the western edge of Meridian Street, and also portions of Illinois Street north of 40th Street. Butler‚ÄìTarkington is known for its attractive residential architecture.  Education  The neighborhood's name comes from Butler University and the famous writer Booth Tarkington. The University has its campus in the neighborhood at 46th St and Sunset Blvd, and Tarkington lived in the neighborhood for 23 years in his country estate until his death in 1946. Butler University moved from Irvington on the city's Far East Side to the Butler‚ÄìTarkington neighborhood in 1928 when it acquired what had been the community's Fairview Park.Bodenhamer, David; Barrows, Robert (1994). \\"Butler University Architecture\\". The encyclopedia of Indianapolis. p. 374. The first school to come to the neighborhood was IPS School 43, which opened in the village of Mapleton in 1883. The school moved into its present building at 150 West 40th Street in 1909. IPS school 86 was built in 1928 at 49th Street and Boulevard Place, and is currently the International School of Indiana. In 1939 St. Thomas Aquinas opened its school (which serves kindergarten through eighth grade) at 4600 North Illinois Street. The Christian Theological Seminary was formed as an independent educational institution from Butler University in 1958, and in 1966 it opened its own campus next to Butler University.

Of his other pseudonyms, only Craig Browning is notable in the genre. He is associated most with Amazing Stories and is known best for short fiction. He was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novelette in 1959. Biography Roger Phillip Graham was a man of many names. He had twenty pseudonyms, including: Clinton Ames, Drew Ames, Robert Arnette, Franklin Bahl, Alexander Blade, Craig Browning, Gregg Conrad, P.F.

Growing up during the Great Depression, Rog became familiar with being on the road which began his love affair with the United States. His father, John Alfred Graham, a veteran of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War moved his family around the country looking for work. Despite this Rog received a fine education. For instance, there was his sophomore year spent at Kingfisher High School in Tulsa, Oklahoma. But in 1931 he was back in Spokane attending and graduating from Gonzaga University. He also studied at the University of Washington in Seattle.Universe Science Fiction, January 1955, The Club House by Rog Phillips, page 98. Graham was a power plant engineer until the beginning of World War II, when he became a shipyard welder. He was also a longshoreman during this phase of his life.Imagination, March 1953, \\"Introducing the Author\\" by Rog Phillips, page fep After the war Rog became a full-time writer, and wrote some three-million words using a myriad of different pseudonyms. On October 8, 1938, at the age of twenty-nine, Rog married Eleanor Cora Smith. They lived together in Kirkland, Washington, with a cat and a dog \\"trained to do tricks,\\" and he worried \\"about the termites who [were] eating away at the foundations of his house.\\" The couple were next-door neighbors to Jack and Dot de Courcy (a couple who would also become science fiction pulp writers as well). By 1946 Rog was divorced from Eleanor.Spacewarp 42, September 1950, \\"Christ, An Autobiography\\" by R.P. Graham The Club House Graham's first published work was a detective story, \\"Murder Note,\\" as by Charles Mann, that appeared in the Winter 1943 issue of The Masked Detective. However, it was editor of Amazing Stories, Raymond A. Palmer, who started Rog on his science fiction career with a $500 advance in 1945 for his first story, \\"Let Freedom Ring!\\"Amazing Stories, December 1945 Graham moved to Evanston, Illinois, to be near Palmer, and associate editor, William Hamling. In response to falling sales, due to the Shaver Mystery Hoax, Palmer instituted a column in March 1948 of fan news and fanzine reviews in Amazing Stories. Called The Club House it was a groundbreaking series that brought the entire community together at just the right time. Conducted by Rog Phillips, now an official staff columnist for Ziff Davis, with just the right flair in his editorials he single-handedly created science fiction fandom as it is now known during the subsequent 57 appearances. During this period 1946 to 1953, Rog experienced the height of his success. His work was catching on. Donald H. Tuck in his bio/bibliography, The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy, Vol. 2: Who's Who, M-Z (Advent:Publishers, Chicago, 1978), of Rog Phillips lists several stories of interest, including ‚ÄúAtom War‚Äù (Amazing Stories, May 1946); ‚ÄúSo Shall Ye Reap!‚Äù (Amazing Stories, August 1947); ‚ÄúM‚ÄôBong-Ah‚Äù (Amazing Stories, February 1949); ‚ÄúThe Cyberene‚Äù (Imagination, December 1953).Rog Phillips' The Club House, The Last Stand, 2013, page xix There is no question that among his best work during this early period were the six stories in his Lefty Baker series: ‚ÄúSqueeze Play\\" (Amazing Stories, November 1947); ‚ÄúThe Immortal Menace‚Äù (Amazing Stories, February 1949); ‚ÄúThe Insane Robot‚Äù (Fantastic Adventures, November 1949); ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Like This‚Äù (Fantastic Story Quarterly, November 1952); ‚ÄúLefty Baker‚Äôs Nuthouse‚Äù (Imaginative Tales, January 1958); ‚Äú‚Ä¶But Who Knows Huer, or Huen?‚Äù (Fantastic, November 1961). After reading each one the reader can tell that Rog had fun writing them. Each Lefty Baker tall-tale drips with his wit and especially his exceptional sense of humor.Rog Phillips' The Club House, The Last Stand, 2013, page xix His original work, Time Trap, published by Century Pocket Books in 1949 (#116), has been cited as being one of the first, if not the first, original science fiction paperback ever printed, because it was the first printed in mass- market rack size. Century Books followed Time Trap by publishing Worlds Within (#124, 1950) and World of If (as by Merit Books, #B-13, 1951). Of some passing interest the Century/Merit Books publishing house was a notorious Chicago Mob (organized crime) operation. Organized crime played and continued to play a major part in publishing during this era, mostly due to its almost complete control of distribution throughout the United States.Rog Phillips' The Club House, The Last Stand, 2013, page xix On Tuesday, October 24, 1951, Graham married Mari Wolf at Country Church in the city of Chicago. As a wedding gift, publisher William Hamling hired Mari Wolf to write a column identical to The Club House, Fandora's Box, for his fledgling science fiction magazine, Imagination. In 1955 Graham divorced Mari Wolf.Amazing Stories, March 1951, The Club House by Rog Phillips, page 146. Mari Wolf The apex to the first half of his science fiction writing career came in July 1952 when he proudly announced in The Club House that Melvin Korshak of Shasta Publishers was going to publish a book of his, Frontiers in the Sky.Amazing Stories, May 1952, The Club House by Rog Phillips, page 138. Shasta never did. Shasta was shortly caught up in a scandal of epic proportion when it failed to pay Philip Jos√© Farmer for winning a writing contest when he submitted a manuscript for a novel that later became the first in the award-winning Riverworld series To Your Scattered Bodies Go. As a consequence Shasta folded. But not before mention of Rog‚Äôs forthcoming book appeared in a blurb on the back of the dust cover for This Island Earth, by Raymond F. Jones, yet another Shasta title.Rog Phillips' The Club House, The Last Stand, 2013, page xx Rog‚Äôs career never really recovered in the manner it deserved. Had Shasta published his book his memory and legacy would have been assured. Almost all the titles they printed have become major collector‚Äôs items over the years, and Rog‚Äôs name would have been in the forefront. Graham was a staffer working for Ziff Davis making $1,000 a month, when new editor Howard Browne came into his own, and Graham was there when they hired a new copy boy, Frank M. Robinson, who would go on to become a major science fiction writer in his own right.Not So Good a Gay Man by Frank M. Robinson, TOR, 2017, page 27.Rog Phillips' The Club House, The Last Stand, 2013, page xviiiRog Phillips' The Club House, The Last Stand, 2013, page 417. The final blow came when Ziff Davis moved its headquarters to New York City. So after 57 appearances, The Club House made its final debut in the March 1953 issue, and with the exception of the appearance of one more story later that year, so did Rog. After writing up to three stories an issue Rog did not make another appearance in Amazing Stories for the next four years. Only when editor Paul W. Fairman took over the reins would Amazing Stories publish an additional eight stories during the 1957-1959 apex of Rog‚Äôs career. It seems that editor Howard Browne finally got his way when he was promoted and seized control of the magazine, firing Rog as he had often threatened to do and using the money saved to replace him in the very next issue with a story by‚Ä¶Robert A. Heinlein,Amazing Stories, September 1950, The Club House by Rog Phillips, page 170. the novelette \\"Project Nightmare.\\"Amazing Stories, April‚ÄìMay 1953, page 20. After a years' hiatus the next appearance of The Club House column was in the July 1954 issue of Universe Science Fiction, another Ray Palmer publication. Five appearances later it was over when Universe folded in March 1955. But another Palmer publication, Other Worlds Science Stories, was there to pick up the column. Five appearances in Other Worlds Science Stories, from May 1955 to April 1956, and both were defunct. Coincidentally, Imagination, a Hamling publication, had been running an identical column, Fandora's Box, conducted by Mari Wolf, Rog's wife. It ran from April 1956 until June 1956, exactly one bi-monthly issue after Other Worlds Science Stories folded. The column ended, as did their marriage, at nearly the same time. With the dwindling acceptance of his fiction, Rog had begun writing a series of regular articles for Mystic magazine, yet another Palmer publication, with such philosophical articles as \\"Searching for the Elixir of Life,\\" as by Drew Ames. In 1957 Graham got married again, to Honey Wood. And as a member of the Outlander fan group, Graham became Program Director for the 1958 Westercon. Honey Wood was a member of the planning committee, helping Rick Sneary with the bookkeeping. The Solacon (SoLaCon: South Los Angeles Convention; the official nickname for the Sixteenth World Science Fiction Convention, also called the 11th Westercon) was organized and run by the Outlanders, a noted West Coast science fiction fan club that had been seeking the convention with a nearly ten-year campaign hyped as \\"South Gate in '58!\\" Graham manufactured the Hugo Award trophies for 1958.Rog Phillips' The Club House, The Last Stand, 2013, page xxi It was during this time that Graham reemerged as a front running science fiction writer with such notable stories as: \\"Game Preserve\\" (If, October 1957) that can be found in Judith Merril's SF '58: The Year's Greatest Science Fiction and Fantasy (Gnome Press, 1958), and \\"The Yellow Pill\\" (Astounding, October 1958) that can be found reprinted in Judith Merril's SF '59: The Year's Greatest Science Fiction and Fantasy (Gnome Press, 1959). Yet, it seems that these stories have been eclipsed by his psychological thriller the lesser known but equally brilliant \\"Rat in the Skull\\" (If, December 1958), which received a well deserved Hugo Award nomination. At the end of his career, Graham was just beginning to receive the recognition his body of work so richly deserved. As only a true romantic such as Graham could truly appreciate he had his swan song shortly before his too-short career ended. His first, and only, hardbound novel, The Involuntary Immortal, enlarged from a Fantastic Adventures novelette (December 1949) was published by Avalon in 1959 only a few years before he started to become too sick to continue to write. Final years Until his death in 1966 only a few more original stories would appear, seven in total, all of them in a different genre, detective/mystery, all within the pages of the Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine. Even though Graham was clearly ill, he kept himself involved with his first love, fandom, as long as he could, with a last official public appearance as Guest of Honor at Westercon XIII in Boise, Idaho, during the July 3‚Äì5, 1960 weekend.Rog Phillips' The Club House, The Last Stand, 2013, page xxii Roger Phillip Graham died on March 2, 1966, of heart complications, at the age of 56. He had been under a doctor's care for the last six years of his life and was scheduled to have heart surgery to replace a defective valve. After being hospitalized for a preoperative period in late February 1966, he was placed into intensive care after he entered a coma. He never recovered.

Churna Island is a small, uninhabited island located in the Arabian Sea, about west of the mouth of the Hub River called \\"Manjhar Beach\\", at the boundary between the provinces of Balochistan and Sindh. Charna is approximately long and wide. Charna is also locally known \\"Cheerno\\". It is 6 km away from Mubarak Village. Fishermen from Mubarak Goth go fishing near Charna Island. Mubarak Goth is the second largest fisherman locality in Karachi; nevertheless, it lacks basic amenities including education, health care, jetties, ownership rights and communication. Background Churna is mostly used as a firing range by the Pakistan Navy. It is also used by tourists for activities such as scuba diving, freediving, underwater photography, hiking, speed boating, kneeboarding, wakesurfing, banana tubing, jet skiing, cliff diving and snorkeling. The area surrounding Charna is popular for scuba diving because of the presence of widely varied marine life and different kinds of coral reef. According to Yousuf Ali, founder of the Karachi Scuba Diving Centre, \\"there are more than 60 types of corals found near Charna waters and many new corals started to flourish\\" after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Jellyfish are found in large numbers during October. Wildlife On 14 September 2017, a mother blue whale was spotted near the island along with her cub. The mother was 17 meters in length. This was a first sighting of a living blue whale in the Pakistani sea, as previous blue whales were just beached skeletons of the dead whales; the last specimen had been observed at Khuddi Creek along the coast of Sindh in August 2014. There have been 47 sightings of baleen whales in this area but none of them were blue whales. On 22 November 2017, a killer whale was spotted near the island, a rare sighting as killer whales are found in deep water, whereas the depth of the water where the whale was sighted was only 72 meters deep. It was also the first sighting of a killer whale in the Karachi area since 2003. Other marine life around Charna includes the yellow-bellied sea snake, great barracuda, narrow-barred Spanish mackerel, cobia, mahi-mahi, skipjack tuna, angel fish, sea urchin, sea fan, oyster, ray fish and rare green turtle. The Pakistan Game Fishing Association (PGFA) holds national angling competitions near Charna. It is the presence of coral reefs around this island that attracts the number of big game fish around it. However, illegal net sizes used by fishing trawlers are destroying this natural treasure.

It is also a branch of the ministry Gospel for Asia. The church now follows an episcopal governance. The church holds Christ as the head of the Church () but also requires that bishops and ordained ministers swear to submit to its metropolitan and any successors of the metropolitan.http://www.gfadiaspora.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Pats- ordination-with-no-last-names.pdf It is governed by a committee of bishops, the Synod, with one central bishop holding the honorary title of \\"first among equals\\" and follows Evangelical Christian doctrine. Believers Eastern Church is administratively based in the state of Kerala in southwestern India. In 2015, the church reported it was re-organized into 33 dioceses; a decrease from the 36 dioceses reported by Smith in 2009. According to Believers Eastern Church, it claims its membership consists of more than 3.5 million people in 10 countries speaking a hundred languages. The Church has 30 bishops, and the Metropolitan Bishop is Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan (formerly known as K. P. Yohannan). History Believers Eastern Church has its roots in Pentecostalism. The denomination was founded in 1993 as part of the Gospel for Asia apostolate. On 6 February 2003, K. J. Samuel, the Moderator Bishop of the Church of South India (a part of the worldwide Anglican Communion), along with the P.M. Dhotekar, Bishop of Nagpur of the Church of North India, and the Bancha Nidhi Nayak, Bishop of Phulbani of the Church of North India, consecrated Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan (formerly known as K. P. Yohannan) as a bishop in Anglican lines of apostolic succession; the K.P. Yohannan thereafter became the first Metropolitan of the Believers Eastern Church, which acquired an episcopal polity of ecclesiastical governance. Believers Eastern Church describes itself as being \\"Apostolic in origin, universal in nature, Biblical and evangelical in faith, ecumenical in outlook\\". It adheres to the Nicene Creed, biblical faith, and traditions of the historical church backed up with its own canonical constitution. It also holds special fraternal relations with Jacobite Syrian Christian Church . The Episcopal Synod and the diocesan councils take the responsibility for planning and executing the mission, religious life and charitable programs of the Church. The Believers Eastern Church is divided as regions into dioceses, each with its own bishop. Each local church has members ranging from less than one hundred to a thousand with an average of hundred, and the number of parishes themselves are increasing. The Believers Eastern Church is divided into various dioceses under the leadership of Diocesan Bishop or a Vicar-general. In 2009, the church ordained seven bishops. On 2 March 2017, Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan (formerly known as K. P. Yohannan)https://www.wthrockmorton.com/2018/10/18/k-p-yohannan-gives-himself- a-new-name/ consecrated twelve bishops for the Believers Eastern Church. Faith and practice The liturgy used in Believers Eastern Church \\"includes prayers, Scripture readings and a confession of the Nicene or Apostles' Creed of the Church.\\" The readings come from the Revised Common Lectionary, which has a three-year cycle; Believers Church observes the liturgical kalendar of Western Christianity, thus keeping Lent, for example. Believers Church administers the sacraments of Baptism and Holy Communion. Women in churches of this denomination wear Christian headcoverings, in accordance with Believers Church's interpretation of . Communicants of Believers Eastern Church use the sign of the cross in their prayers. Believers Eastern Church is an \\"Ancient- Future Church\\" and as such, is considered by some to be heretical. Beliefs The church accepts the Old Testament and New Testament of the Bible as the inspired Word of God which is inerrant and the fundamental standard of faith,K.P. Yohannan (2004). Guiding Principles of Believers Eastern Church. Believers Eastern Church Publications. pp. 197-199. and complete and final written revelation of God. It also adheres to the Nicene Creed. The church believes in the following doctrines: * One eternal God revealed in the trinity: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. * The divinity and humanity of Jesus Christ, his virgin birth, sinless life, crucifixion and resurrection, ascension and intercession of Holy Spirit. * The outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon believers in Jerusalem after Jesus‚Äô ascension, enabling them to preach the Gospel to the whole world. * Separation of all mankind from God through man's sin. * Immediate forgiveness of sins through repentance and acceptance of Jesus Christ. * The person and work of indwelling and empowerment of the Holy Spirit through baptism for all believers. * The practice of gifts of the Holy Spirit within scriptural guidelines for the common good (); Considers that agape love is more important than all the gifts, and without it, all exercise of spiritual gifts as worthless. * Jesus Christ as the head of the church. * The second coming of Jesus Christ and it will be personal and visible, which motivates active involvement of the laity in church activities. * The resurrection of the body unto eternal life for the saved and unto eternal separation for the lost; But salvation, redemption and forgiveness are freely offered to all by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Core values For being distinguishable members of Believers Eastern church, and the message of the Word of God to be applied in an individual's life leading to a greater maturity in Christ, following are the official code of living. * Knowing the Lord Jesus more fully and intimately. * Being a people of integrity and excellence. * Living in submission to God's Word. * Being a people of faith. * Being a people committed to prayer and worship. * Having a servant lifestyle. * Being a people of grace and love. * Serving sacrificially. * Being a people with passion for souls. * Being a people who work together with the Body of Christ. Religious orders The Sisters of Compassion is a religious order of nuns within Believers Church that is dedicated to serving the \\"neglected of society\\". Humanitarian services Bridge of Hope students on their way to class. Believers Eastern Church is involved in various social projects and has been lauded for \\"its humanitarian service towards the society at large.\\"\\"Church devoted to literacy campaign.\\" Times of India (May 25, 2011) The church's social service includes poverty alleviation,\\"Bihar, News in Brief: Project\\" The Telegraph (June 25, 2012) and promoting adult literacy. The church is also providing shelter to street children through a home called Asha Grih, which is licensed by the Indian Government.\\"Believers Eastern Church turns new page in lives of lesser privileged\\" Echo of Arunachal (July 22, 2012) Additionally, Believers Eastern Church has a child development project called Bridge of Hope (BOH). BOH provides holistic development to needy children throughout South Asia. As of 2012, the project is helping 60,000 underprivileged children by providing them free education, a nutritious diet and school supplies. Bridge of Hope's 525 project centers are staffed by 2,400 individuals. Other major projects include the Believers Church Medical College Hospital, Believers Eastern Church Caarmel Engineering College and Believers Church Theological Seminary. Most of the funds for these social projects are sent over from the United States by the ministry Gospel for Asia, of which Believers Church is a part. The metropolitan of Believers Church, Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan (formerly known as K. P. Yohannan), is also the president of Gospel for Asia. Court rulings The Times of India has reported that \\"The Believers Church, founded by Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan (formerly known as K. P. Yohannan), and three NGOs associated with it have been barred from bringing in foreign funds to India with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) canceling their FCRA registrations.\\" As of September 2017, GFA provided the requested documents for review to MHA and \\"Fr Panthapallil said though the MHA website has advertised that the registrations of the four organisations are cancelled, they are still under revision.\\" In August 2017, The Hindu (a newspaper in India) reported that, \\"The Church of South India (CSI) has decided to pull out from the Kerala Council of Churches (KCC), an ecumenical forum of non-Catholic Protestant Churches in Kerala, in protest against the KCC decision to provide membership to the Believers Church. The latest development has to be viewed in the backdrop of the controversy over the episcopacy claims of the Believers Eastern Church that its head, K.P. Yohannan, was consecrated by the CSI Church.\\" Narada News in India reported concerning that, \\"The CSI senate committee probed the issue. They came to the conclusion that their bishop was paid huge sums of money and a luxury car for this. The church sacked bishop KJ Samuel from the CSI for this deed.\\" There is also been an ongoing court case regarding the illegal filling in of wetlands in order to build the Believers Church Medical College Hospital. GFA has been paying a special tax because a \\"substantial\\" amount of its income is not used for intended purposes of the fundraising. An Indian court said, \\"It is not in dispute that substantial income of the assessee trust was not used by both the assessees for the purposes for which they were formed.\\" Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan (formerly known as K. P. Yohannan) says that the claims were politically motivated and that the workings of Gospel for Asia and Believers Church are transparent. GFA has been criticized for engaging in predatory proselytization while providing aid in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami. The Hindu American Foundation condemned the organization for pressuring vulnerable tsunami victims to convert to Christianity, setting up illegal unregistered orphanages and forcing orphans recite the Christian prayers several times a day. The operations of Gospel for Asia and Believers Eastern Church were scrutinized after Believers Eastern Church, under the guidance of Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan (formerly known as K. P. Yohannan), purchased a rubber estate in Kerala, India. Opponents said the church had diverted foreign funds to amass land for itself and for uses other than declared purposes. Further, it was alleged that the rubber estate, which Believers Eastern Church purchased from Harrison's Malayalam Ltd., was on leasehold from the government and not saleable. Hence, Believers Eastern Church was accused of illegally holding government land. At a later time, Harrison's Malayalam was accused of forging their land title, leading to continued debate about the legality of the sale. Legal proceedings are still ongoing. \\"Former Ernakulam District Collector Dr M G Rajamanickam, who was appointed as the Special Officer of the government to confiscate the illegal and excess estate lands under the custody of various companies, had issued an order in May, 2015, confiscating the 2,268 acre of land from Believers Eastern Church.\\" However, this ruling was appealed and now there is further complication because the local government wants to build an airport on this estate. News outlets are reporting that the local government wants to buy the property. However, it is also reported that \\"The government does not need permission from K P Yohannan to set up airport in the Cheruvally estate, BJP national executive member V Muraleedharan said.\\" The BJP is currently behind a large scale anti-corruption crackdown on Black Money inside India. The final status of the estate for building the airport is still unsettled. There is also been an ongoing court case regarding the illegal filling in of wetlands in order to build the Believers Eastern Church Medical College Hospital. GFA has been paying a special tax because a \\"substantial\\" amount of its income is not used for intended purposes of the fundraising.

Further, the rubber estate is an investment to help fund social work among underdeveloped communities and not a personal land grab as opponents have stated.

In other words, the reduction criterion is a separability criterion. It was first proved and independently formulated in 1999. Violation of the reduction criterion is closely related to the distillability of the state in question. Details Let H1 and H2 be Hilbert spaces of finite dimensions n and m respectively. L(Hi) will denote the space of linear operators acting on Hi. Consider a bipartite quantum system whose state space is the tensor product : H = H_1 \\\\otimes H_2. An (un-normalized) mixed state œÅ is a positive linear operator (density matrix) acting on H. A linear map Œ¶: L(H2) ‚Üí L(H1) is said to be positive if it preserves the cone of positive elements, i.e. A is positive implied Œ¶(A) is also. From the one-to-one correspondence between positive maps and entanglement witnesses, we have that a state œÅ is entangled if and only if there exists a positive map Œ¶ such that :(I \\\\otimes \\\\Phi)(\\\\rho) is not positive. Therefore, if œÅ is separable, then for all positive map Œ¶, :(I \\\\otimes \\\\Phi)(\\\\rho) \\\\geq 0. Thus every positive, but not completely positive, map Œ¶ gives rise to a necessary condition for separability in this way. The reduction criterion is a particular example of this. Suppose H1 = H2. Define the positive map Œ¶: L(H2) ‚Üí L(H1) by :\\\\Phi(A) = \\\\operatorname{Tr}A - A. It is known that Œ¶ is positive but not completely positive. So a mixed state œÅ being separable implies :(I \\\\otimes \\\\Phi) (\\\\rho) \\\\geq 0. Direct calculation shows that the above expression is the same as :I \\\\otimes \\\\rho_1 - \\\\rho \\\\geq 0 where œÅ1 is the partial trace of œÅ with respect to the second system. The dual relation :\\\\rho_2 \\\\otimes I - \\\\rho \\\\geq 0 is obtained in the analogous fashion. The reduction criterion consists of the above two inequalities. Connection with Fr√©chet bounds The above last two inequalities together with lower bounds for œÅ can be seen as quantum Fr√©chet inequalities, that is as the quantum analogous of the classical Fr√©chet probabilistic bounds, that hold for separable quantum states. The upper bounds are the previous ones I \\\\otimes \\\\rho_1 \\\\geq \\\\rho, \\\\rho_2 \\\\otimes I \\\\geq \\\\rho, and the lower bounds are the obvious constraint \\\\rho \\\\geq 0 together with \\\\rho \\\\geq I \\\\otimes \\\\rho_1 + \\\\rho_2 \\\\otimes I -I , where I are identity matrices of suitable dimensions. The lower bounds have been obtained in. These bounds are satisfied by separable density matrices, while entangled states can violate them. Entangled states exhibit a form of stochastic dependence stronger than the strongest classical dependence and in fact they violate Fr√©chet like bounds. It is also worth mentioning that is possible to give a Bayesian interpretation of these bounds.

On Mondays, students are required to wear their formal uniform. For the juniors(7-9), this consists of a blue shirt and navy shorts or trousers for boys, and a blue blouse and navy skirt for girls, while the seniors(10-12) wear a white shirt instead. All senior students (years 10, 11 and 12) are required to wear a senior tie with their formal uniforms, while junior girls wear a crossover tie. Male senior students are only required to wear their tie in terms two and three. During the other four days of the school week, students have a choice of wearing either the formal uniform or the unisex sports uniform. This consists of navy shorts as well as a green, navy blue and gold striped shirt for juniors and a predominantly navy blue shirt for seniors. Academics Narangba Valley State High School offers schooling from grade 7 (Grade 8 before 2015) through to 12. The school has had a reasonable amount of academic success, with 71% of students receiving an OP of 1 - 15 in 2006, one of the highest scores for state schools in the district.couriermail.com.au Queensland school OPs 2006 Subjects are offered in a wide range of curriculum areas: Mathematics, English, SOSE, Science, Performing Arts, Life Technology (Home Economics), Design Technology (Manual Arts), ICT and Business, Physical Education, LOTE (Japanese and French) and Visual Arts. As well as these Academic subjects, the school also has a weekly lesson designed to enhance the life skills of the students, known as SGD (Student Growth and Development). Another of these weekly lessons is VAP (Access to Vocational Pathways). In VAP, Year 10 students have been completing a Certificate I in Work Education, adding points towards their Queensland Certificate of Education. In Years 11 and 12, students complete preparation tests for the Queensland Core Skills Test Academy Programs Since 2004 the school has offered extension programs in many subjects. Students are given the opportunity to nominate or be selected for the fast-tracked subjects in Year 8. These programs are offered in a number of different areas. They offer the SMA (Science and Maths Academy) for the more academically excelling students, a music academy, and an AFL and netball are being offered as well. Core Subjects Students who achieve outstanding academic results are selected to take part in these programs. The programs are offered until Year 11, when students are given the opportunity to undertake further courses during their senior years. Academies are offered in Mathematics, English, Science and SOSE Performing arts At the beginning of Year 7, students are asked to audition for either of the three academies: Music, Dance and/or Drama. These students complete work faster than ordinary classes, and their assessment is expected to be of a higher standard. These academies continue until year 10, where students progress to complete their senior studies. A recent addition to the academy program is Academy Camp and Tour. This involves Academy students preparing and rehearsing a performance, before traveling to a number of local schools and presenting the act.

It was the first AFL academy in the state to have female participants. The grade 8 academy students won the statewide Fast Nines competition in 2005 and the Junior (grade 8 and 9) AFL team won the statewide Lion's Cup for 2006. This feat was also achieved by both the Junior and Senior girls teams in 2006. This great triumph was repeated in 2007 by the junior girls team. The boys' and girls' AFL teams have both completed a trip to Melbourne, in 2007 and 2008 respectively, to compete against local school teams. In 2010 the grade 8 girls won Fast Nines.

A coordinate system is said to satisfy the harmonic coordinate condition if each of the coordinate functions xŒ± (regarded as scalar fields) satisfies d'Alembert's equation. The parallel notion of a harmonic coordinate system in Riemannian geometry is a coordinate system whose coordinate functions satisfy Laplace's equation. Since d'Alembert's equation is the generalization of Laplace's equation to space-time, its solutions are also called \\"harmonic\\". Motivation The laws of physics can be expressed in a generally invariant form. In other words, the real world does not care about our coordinate systems. However, for us to be able to solve the equations, we must fix upon a particular coordinate system. A coordinate condition selects one (or a smaller set of) such coordinate system(s). The Cartesian coordinates used in special relativity satisfy d'Alembert's equation, so a harmonic coordinate system is the closest approximation available in general relativity to an inertial frame of reference in special relativity. Derivation In general relativity, we have to use the covariant derivative instead of the partial derivative in d'Alembert's equation, so we get: :0 = \\\\left(x^\\\\alpha\\\\right)_{; \\\\beta ; \\\\gamma} g^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} = \\\\left(\\\\left(x^\\\\alpha\\\\right)_{, \\\\beta , \\\\gamma} - \\\\left(x^\\\\alpha\\\\right)_{, \\\\sigma} \\\\Gamma^{\\\\sigma}_{\\\\beta \\\\gamma}\\\\right) g^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} \\\\,. Since the coordinate xŒ± is not actually a scalar, this is not a tensor equation. That is, it is not generally invariant. But coordinate conditions must not be generally invariant because they are supposed to pick out (only work for) certain coordinate systems and not others. Since the partial derivative of a coordinate is the Kronecker delta, we get: :0 = \\\\left(\\\\delta^\\\\alpha_{\\\\beta , \\\\gamma} - \\\\delta^\\\\alpha_{\\\\sigma} \\\\Gamma^{\\\\sigma}_{\\\\beta \\\\gamma}\\\\right) g^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} = \\\\left(0 - \\\\Gamma^{\\\\alpha}_{\\\\beta \\\\gamma}\\\\right) g^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} = - \\\\Gamma^{\\\\alpha}_{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} g^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} \\\\,. And thus, dropping the minus sign, we get the harmonic coordinate condition (also known as the de Donder gauge after Th√©ophile de Donder [John Stewart (1991), \\"Advanced General Relativity\\", Cambridge University Press, ]): :0 = \\\\Gamma^{\\\\alpha}_{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} g^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} \\\\,. This condition is especially useful when working with gravitational waves. Alternative form Consider the covariant derivative of the density of the reciprocal of the metric tensor: :0 = \\\\left(g^{\\\\mu u} \\\\sqrt {-g}\\\\right)_{; \\\\rho} = \\\\left(g^{\\\\mu u} \\\\sqrt {-g}\\\\right)_{, \\\\rho} + g^{\\\\sigma u} \\\\Gamma^{\\\\mu}_{\\\\sigma \\\\rho} \\\\sqrt {-g} + g^{\\\\mu \\\\sigma} \\\\Gamma^{ u}_{\\\\sigma \\\\rho} \\\\sqrt {-g} - g^{\\\\mu u} \\\\Gamma^{\\\\sigma}_{\\\\sigma \\\\rho} \\\\sqrt {-g} \\\\,. The last term \\\\- g^{\\\\mu u} \\\\Gamma^{\\\\sigma}_{\\\\sigma \\\\rho} \\\\sqrt {-g} emerges because \\\\sqrt {-g} is not an invariant scalar, and so its covariant derivative is not the same as its ordinary derivative. Rather, \\\\sqrt {-g}_{; \\\\rho} = 0 \\\\\\\\! because g^{\\\\mu u}_{; \\\\rho} = 0 \\\\\\\\!, while \\\\sqrt {-g}_{, \\\\rho} = \\\\sqrt {-g} \\\\Gamma^{\\\\sigma}_{\\\\sigma \\\\rho} \\\\,. Contracting ŒΩ with œÅ and applying the harmonic coordinate condition to the second term, we get: :\\\\begin{align} 0 &= \\\\left(g^{\\\\mu u} \\\\sqrt {-g}\\\\right)_{, u} + g^{\\\\sigma u} \\\\Gamma^{\\\\mu}_{\\\\sigma u} \\\\sqrt {-g} + g^{\\\\mu \\\\sigma} \\\\Gamma^{ u}_{\\\\sigma u} \\\\sqrt {-g} - g^{\\\\mu u} \\\\Gamma^{\\\\sigma}_{\\\\sigma u} \\\\sqrt {-g} \\\\,\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\left(g^{\\\\mu u} \\\\sqrt {-g}\\\\right)_{, u} + 0 + g^{\\\\mu \\\\alpha} \\\\Gamma^{\\\\beta}_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\sqrt {-g} - g^{\\\\mu \\\\alpha} \\\\Gamma^{\\\\beta}_{\\\\beta \\\\alpha} \\\\sqrt {-g} \\\\,. \\\\end{align} Thus, we get that an alternative way of expressing the harmonic coordinate condition is: :0 = \\\\left(g^{\\\\mu u} \\\\sqrt {-g}\\\\right)_{, u} \\\\,. More variant forms If one expresses the Christoffel symbol in terms of the metric tensor, one gets :0 = \\\\Gamma^{\\\\alpha}_{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} g^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} = \\\\frac{1}{2} g^{\\\\alpha \\\\delta} \\\\left( g_{\\\\gamma \\\\delta , \\\\beta} + g_{\\\\beta \\\\delta , \\\\gamma} - g_{\\\\beta \\\\gamma , \\\\delta} \\\\right) g^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} \\\\,. Discarding the factor of g^{\\\\alpha \\\\delta} \\\\, and rearranging some indices and terms, one gets : g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta , \\\\gamma} \\\\, g^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} = \\\\frac{1}{2} g_{\\\\beta \\\\gamma , \\\\alpha} \\\\, g^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} \\\\,. In the context of linearized gravity, this is indistinguishable from these additional forms: :\\\\begin{align} h_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta , \\\\gamma} \\\\, g^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} &= \\\\frac12 h_{\\\\beta \\\\gamma , \\\\alpha} \\\\, g^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} \\\\,; \\\\\\\\\\\\ g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta , \\\\gamma} \\\\, \\\\eta^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} &= \\\\frac12 g_{\\\\beta \\\\gamma , \\\\alpha} \\\\, \\\\eta^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} \\\\,; \\\\\\\\\\\\ h_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta , \\\\gamma} \\\\, \\\\eta^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} &= \\\\frac12 h_{\\\\beta \\\\gamma , \\\\alpha} \\\\, \\\\eta^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} \\\\,. \\\\end{align} However, the last two are a different coordinate condition when you go to the second order in h. Effect on the wave equation For example, consider the wave equation applied to the electromagnetic vector potential: :0 = A_{\\\\alpha ; \\\\beta ; \\\\gamma} g^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} \\\\,. Let us evaluate the right hand side: :A_{\\\\alpha ; \\\\beta ; \\\\gamma} g^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} = A_{\\\\alpha ; \\\\beta , \\\\gamma} g^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} - A_{\\\\sigma ; \\\\beta} \\\\Gamma^{\\\\sigma}_{\\\\alpha \\\\gamma} g^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} - A_{\\\\alpha ; \\\\sigma} \\\\Gamma^{\\\\sigma}_{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} g^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} \\\\,. Using the harmonic coordinate condition we can eliminate the right-most term and then continue evaluation as follows: :\\\\begin{align} A_{\\\\alpha ; \\\\beta ; \\\\gamma} g^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} &= A_{\\\\alpha ; \\\\beta , \\\\gamma} g^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} - A_{\\\\sigma ; \\\\beta} \\\\Gamma^{\\\\sigma}_{\\\\alpha \\\\gamma} g^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= A_{\\\\alpha , \\\\beta , \\\\gamma} g^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} - A_{\\\\rho , \\\\gamma} \\\\Gamma^{\\\\rho}_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} g^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} - A_{\\\\rho} \\\\Gamma^{\\\\rho}_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta , \\\\gamma} g^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} \\\\- A_{\\\\sigma , \\\\beta} \\\\Gamma^{\\\\sigma}_{\\\\alpha \\\\gamma} g^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} \\\\- A_{\\\\rho} \\\\Gamma^{\\\\rho}_{\\\\sigma \\\\beta} \\\\Gamma^{\\\\sigma}_{\\\\alpha \\\\gamma} g^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} \\\\,. \\\\end{align} See also *Christoffel symbols *Covariant derivative *Gauge theory *General relativity *General covariance *Holonomic basis *Kronecker delta *Laplace's equation *Laplace operator *Ricci calculus *Wave equation References *P.A.M.Dirac (1975), General Theory of Relativity, Princeton University Press, , chapter 22 External links * http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HarmonicCoordinates.html Category:Coordinate charts in general relativity ","title":"Harmonic coordinate condition"},{"id":"7203377","text":"A Spectrum of Finite Scale is a tour-only album by the band Man or Astro-man?

He is the editor, author or co-author of more than fifty books and gaming related titles, notably various Fighting Fantasy gamebooks, Shadowrun novels and adventures, Earthdawn novels and adventures, the original Games Workshop Judge Dredd roleplaying game, and material for Paranoia, Call of Cthulhu and many others listed below. Biography Marc Gascoigne co-wrote Games Workshop's original Judge Dredd Roleplaying Game and Puffin's mass-market Advanced Fighting Fantasy trilogy. Gascoigne also published Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay. He has also written and edited for Chaosium, West End Games, and FASA. Gascoigne was the developer or editor of several of GW's classic boardgames in the mid-1980s, including the first two editions of Blood Bowl, and created the background for Dark Future, ported onto the car-based boardgame after the cancellation of an original cyberpunk- themed roleplaying game. Although he worked on the popular children's series Fighting Fantasy as an editor, he only ever published one gamebook as author, which was called Battleblade Warrior. It was number 31 of 59 in the original series and was released in early 1988. However, he also wrote two related novels, and five books under the Advanced Fighting Fantasy banner, including Titan, an encyclopedia of the fictional world in which most of the gamebooks are set. After ten years as a freelance editor, including time on Puffin's Fighting Fantasy gamebook series, he returned to Games Workshop in 1997 to help establish the Black Library fiction imprint. Starting as editor he became publisher and overall manager of the BL Publishing family of imprints, that during a time also included Black Industries and Solaris Books. Under Gascoigne, with Warhammer experts Rick Priestley and Andy Jones, the idea for the Black Library slowly evolved and produced the magazine Inferno! as a result beginning in July 1997. Gascoigne was the general manager of Games Workshop's BL Publishing division, making books, board games, and RPGs. He left this post at the end of March 2008 when Games Workshop downsized its staff. It was announced on 11th Sept 2008 that he had joined HarperCollins to create a new science fiction & fantasy imprint to be called Angry Robot. Angry Robot was acquired by Osprey Publishing in September 2010. In October 2011, Gascoigne won the World Fantasy Special Award‚ÄîProfessional for Angry Robot, presented at the World Fantasy Convention in San Diego, California.Science Fiction Awards Database: Marc Gascoigne (retrieved 9 July 2018) In 2014 Angry Robot was sold by Osprey to Watkins Media.> In 2016 Gascoigne won the British Fantasy Award in the category Best Independent Press, again for Angry Robot.

People who are not familiar with the Batak language may erroneously assume Parmalim is the name of the religion rather than its practitioners. At the end of the 19th and in the beginning of the 20th century the Parmalim movement, which originated in Toba lands spread to other areas of the Batak lands. Especially in the lower Karo lands, the 'dusun' the Malim religion, became very influential as an expression of anti-colonial sentiments at the turn of the 20th century. Today the majority of Parmalim are Toba Batak. The largest of the several existing Parmalim groups has its centre in Huta Tinggi in the vicinity of Laguboti on the south shore of Lake Toba. The Malim religion has some similarities with Islam, including a prohibition on the consumption of pork and of blood, and the practice of wearing turbans. Modern Malim deny that these practices were derived from Islam. One of the first leaders of the Parmalim movement was Raja Mulia Naipospos. Modern Parmalim trace their heritage to Sisingamangaraja XII, a Batak leader in the fight against the Dutch, whose spirit is still alive in his successors. According to Raja Marnakkok Naipospos, a modern Parmalim leader, the faith has often be slandered as devil worship 'Campaigns branding Parmalim as devil worshippers still exist today', he said, 'Batak not familiar with Malim regard it as a heresy. But in fact, Malim recognizes the existence of the one and only Almighty God'. (Mula Jadi Na Bolon in Batak mythology).

She was the first Welsh woman to become a fellow of the Royal Society. By the time she was 80 years old, she had published 68 papers. Early life and education Rees was born in the Welsh town of Abercynon in 1906, and attended the town's Intermediate School for Girls (1918‚Äì24). She attended University College, Cardiff (now known as Cardiff University) with three scholarships. During her time there, she studied chemistry, biology and zoology, earning honours in zoology. Rees then went on to complete her doctorate in 18 months, studying the trematode parasites in different species of snails. Over the course of 100 days she collected more than 5,000 snails from nearly 90 locations in Glamorgan and Monmouthshire counties in Wales. Career Rees' career was at the Zoology Department of the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, where she successively held positions of Assistant Lecturer (1930‚Äì7), Lecturer (1937‚Äì47), Senior Lecturer (1947‚Äì66), Reader (1966‚Äì71) and Professor (1971‚Äì3), becoming Professor Emeritus in semi-retirement in 1973. She was also Chairman of the School of Biological Studies (1972‚Äì3) and acting Head of Department (1948, 1969, 1970). During her time as a staff member at the University College of Wales at Abernathy Rees supervised 215 honours students and 25 post-graduate students. Her research was in the area of helminthology, focusing on systematics, comparative functional morphology, histology and life cycles of trematode and cestode parasites. Her work was important in elucidating the relationship of these parasites with their non-vertebrate intermediate hosts. From 1960 to 1981 Rees was involved with the publication Parasitology. For the first 10 years, she was a member of the editorial board and then went on to serve as chair of the editorial board until 1981. She was a founder member of the British Society for Parasitology, and served as its vice-president (1970‚Äì72) and president (1972‚Äì74). Rees died in Aberystwyth, on 4 October 1994. Awards and honours Rees became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1971, the first Welsh woman to be elected. She was also elected Fellow of the Institute of Biology in the same year. She received the Linnean Medal, the highest award of the Linnean Society, in 1990. She was also featured in a 1975 Vogue article on influential and interesting British women.

United States Criminal venue The perceived abuse of English criminal venue law was one of the enumerated grievances in the United States Declaration of Independence, which accused George III of the United Kingdom of \\"transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offenses.\\"U.S. Declaration of Independence. Article Three of the United States Constitution provides: \\"Trial of all Crimes . . . shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.\\"U.S. Const. Art. III, ¬ß 2, cl. 3. The \\"where the said Crimes shall have been committed\\" language refers to the locus delicti, and a single crime may often give rise to several constitutionally permissible venues.Travis v. United States, 364 U.S. 631, 634-35 (1961); United States v. Cores, 356 U.S. 405, 407 (1958); Armour Packing Co. v. United States, 209 U.S. 56, 76-77 (1908). \\"[T]he locus delicti must be determined from the nature of the crime alleged and the location of the act or acts constituting it.\\"United States v. Cabrales, 524 U.S. 1, 6-7 (1998) (quoting United States v. Anderson, 328 U.S. 699, 703 (1946)). Thus, venue may be constitutionally permissible even if an individual defendant was never personally present in the relevant state.Burton v. United States, 202 U.S. 344, 387-89 (1906); Horner v. United States, 143 U.S. 207, 213-14 (1892); Palliser v. United States, 136 U.S. 257, 265-66 (1890). For example, conspiracy may be prosecuted wherever the agreement occurred or wherever any overt act was committed.Hyde v. Shine, 199 U.S. 62, 76-78 (1905); Dealy v. United States, 152 U.S. 539, 546-47 (1894); Palliser, 136 U.S. at 265-66. For the purposes of constitutional venue, the boundaries of the states are questions of law to be determined by the judge, but the location of the crime is a question of fact to be determined by the jury.United States v. Jackalow, 66 U.S. (1 Black) 484 (1861). The venue provision of Article III (regulating the location of the trial) is distinct from the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment (regulating the geography from which the jury pool is selected). The unit of the former is the state; the unit of the later is the state and judicial district. Unlike judicial districts under the Vicinage Clause, consistent with Article III, Congress may \\"provide a place of trial where none was provided when the offense was committed, or change the place of trial after the commission of the offense.\\"Cook v. United States. 138 U.S. 157, 183 (1891); see also United States v. Dawson, 56 U.S. (15 How.) 467, 487-88 (1853). Civil venue Venue is either a county (for cases in state court) or a district or division (for cases in federal court). Venue deals with locality of a lawsuit--that is, in which locale a lawsuit may be filed or commenced. It involves a decision of which district (federal court) or county (state court) is appropriate, based typically on where a matter occurred or where the defendant resides. A case can be brought only in a certain venue. For instance, in federal diversity cases, the venue can be only (1) the district where any defendant resides if all defendants reside in the same state (although corporations reside in any district that may exercise personal jurisdiction over them, according to (b), (2) the district where a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred, or (3) the district in which any defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction if there is no district in which the claim can otherwise be brought (). Venue under American law is a concept distinct from jurisdiction, which focuses on the authority of a court to hear a particular case. Venue is concerned with the geographical location of the court where a lawsuit is commenced. However, unlike personal jurisdiction, there is no constitutional requirement for proper venue in order to have a valid judgment. The general venue statute for United States federal courts is with special rules listed in ¬ß¬ß 1392-1413. Venue can be transferred from one federal district to another (). A case can also be removed from a state court to a federal court. Finally, a case may be dismissed because its venue is harshly \\"unfair\\" to one or more parties under a doctrine called forum non conveniens, often used in cases where the events took place in a foreign country. Defendants can waive venue at the time of trial (Neirbo Co. v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., ). Plaintiffs can waive venue at the time of trial. Plaintiffs may also waive their right to sue in certain venues through a contract that contains a valid and reasonable forum selection clause or venue selection clause. Forum selection clauses, establishing venue convenient to the offeror, are near universal in form contracts offered by a party that does business in many places. The proper recourse for challenging venue is a motion to dismiss for improper venue. Fed. R. Civ. P 12(b)(3). This is one of the waivable defenses, meaning that this must be made in the initial response to the complaint or it will be waived.

It is integrated into the Ministry of Justice, but operates under the supervision of the Public Ministry. Several countries and territories that were once overseas provinces of Portugal maintain criminal investigation police forces modeled after the Portuguese one, with some of them retaining also the name Pol√≠cia Judici√°ria. These are the cases of Cabo Verde, Guinea-Bissau and Macau. The Pol√≠cia Judici√°ria Militar (Military Judicial Police) is a separate criminal investigation police agency that operates under the Ministry of National Defense. This agency is responsible for the investigation of military crimes and crimes committed among the Portuguese Armed Forces. History The present Pol√≠cia Judici√°ria originates from a division of the old Pol√≠cia Civil (Civil Police). The Pol√≠cia Civil was founded on 2 July 1867, during the reign of Lu√≠s I of Portugal and changed its name to Pol√≠cia C√≠vica (Civic Police) in 1910. By decree of 29 August 1893, the Pol√≠cia de Investiga√ß√£o Judici√°ria e Preventiva (Judicial Investigation and Preventive Police) branch of the Pol√≠cia Civil was created. In 1922, this branch became the Pol√≠cia de Investiga√ß√£o Criminal (PIC, Criminal Investigation Police). In 1927, it became an autonomous police service under the Ministry of Justice. On 20 October 1945, the PIC changed its name to Pol√≠cia Judici√°ria. Organization The Pol√≠cia Judici√°ria is headed by a National Director, appointed together by the Prime-Minister and the Minister of Justice. Under the National Director, the PJ includes the following organic units: * National Directorate; * National Directorate services: **Judicial Police School, **Technological Prevention and Support Unit, **Financial Information Unit, **Asset Recovery Office, **Planning, Technical Assessment and Documentation Unit; * National units: **National Counter-Terrorism Unit **National Anti-Corruption Unit, **National Anti-Drug Trafficking Unit; **National Unit for Cybercrime Fighting and Technological Criminality; * Territorial units: **North Directorate, **Center Directorate, **Lisbon and Tagus Valley Directorate, ** South Directorate; * Regional units: **Funchal Criminal Investigation Department, **Ponta Delgada Criminal Investigation Department, **Braga Criminal Investigation Department, **Aveiro Criminal Investigation Department, **Guarda Criminal Investigation Department, **Leiria Criminal Investigation Department, **Set√∫bal Criminal Investigation Department, **Portim√£o Criminal Investigation Department; * Local units: **Vila Real Criminal Investigation Local Unit, **√âvora Criminal Investigation Local Unit; * Criminal investigation Support units: **Criminal Investigation Intelligence Unit, **International Cooperation Unit, **Scientific Police Laboratory, **Telecommunications and Computer Unit; * Support units: **Security, Financial and Patrimonial Administration Unit, **Human Resources and Public Relations Unit, **Financial and Accounting Expertise Unit, **Disciplinary and Inspection Unit. Mission The Pol√≠cia Judici√°ria is officially responsible for criminal investigation and evidence collection. In addition to this, almost all homicides in Portuguese territory are handled by the PJ (there is also the unrelated Pol√≠cia Judici√°ria Militar, the criminal investigation military police). The crime fighting work performed by the Pol√≠cia Judici√°ria is regularly shown in the Portuguese media. Major drug trafficking combat operations are often reported in the main Portuguese television networks and other media, as well as the dismantling of organized crime groups linked with terrorism, corruption, fraud, burglary, robbery, forgery and other crimes. In the 2000s, the Pol√≠cia Judici√°ria had a rate of success of 77.43% in finding missing children, including abductions and runaway children. In 2009 alone, PJ had a 100% success rate in finding missing children (193 cases solved out of 193; 53 in the Lisbon Region). The same happened in 2010. Equipment Although the Pol√≠cia Judici√°ria can use virtually any weapons of any caliber if necessary, they are issued with the Glock 19 as their standard firearm - like their Pol√≠cia de Seguran√ßa P√∫blica and Guarda Nacional Republicana counterparts - with the Glock 26 used by mainly female agents.

In areas with low population density waste generation may have been negligible. In higher population areas even largely biodegradable waste had to be dealt with. Sometimes this was released back into the ground water with environmental impact like Nor Loch. The Maya of Central America had a fixed monthly ritual, in which the people of the village would gather together and burn their garbage in large dumps. Modern era Sir Edwin Chadwick Following the onset of industrialization and the sustained urban growth of large population centres in England, the buildup of waste in the cities caused a rapid deterioration in levels of sanitation and the general quality of urban life. The streets became choked with filth due to the lack of waste clearance regulations.Florence Nightingale, Selected Writings of Florence Nightingale, ed. Lucy Ridgely Seymer (New York: The Macmillan Co., 1954), pp. 38287 Calls for the establishment of a municipal authority with waste removal powers were mooted as early as 1751 by Corbyn Morris in London, who proposed that \\"...as the preservation of the health of the people is of great importance, it is proposed that the cleaning of this city, should be put under one uniform public management, and all the filth be...conveyed by the Thames to proper distance in the country\\". The first occurrence of organised solid waste management system appeared in London in the late 18th century. A waste collection and resource recovery system was established around the 'dust- yards'. Main constituent of municipal waste was the coal ash (‚Äòdust‚Äô) which had a market value for brick-making and as a soil improver. Such profitability encouraged dust-contractors to recover effectively 100% of the residual wastes remaining after readily saleable items and materials had been removed by the informal sector in the streets ('rag-and-bone men'). Therefore, this was an early example of organised, municipal-wide solid waste management. The dust- yard system had been working successfully up to middle 1850s, when the market value of ‚Äòdust‚Äô collapsed. It was important in facilitating a relatively smooth transition to an institutionalised, municipally-run solid waste management system in England. In the mid-19th century, spurred by increasingly devastating cholera outbreaks and the emergence of a public health debate that the first consolidated legislation on the issue emerged. Highly influential in this new focus was the report The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population in 1842 of the social reformer, Edwin Chadwick, in which he argued for the importance of adequate waste removal and management facilities to improve the health and wellbeing of the city's population. Chadwick's proposals were based on the miasmatic theory of disease transmission, which was proven to be false following the turn of the 1900s. The Nuisance Removal and Disease Prevention Act of 1846 began what was to be a steadily evolving process of the provision of regulated waste management in London. The Metropolitan Board of Works was the first citywide authority that centralized sanitation regulation for the rapidly expanding city and the Public Health Act 1875 made it compulsory for every household to deposit their weekly waste in 'moveable receptacles' for disposal - the first concept for a dust-bin. Manlove, Alliott & Co. Ltd. 1894 destructor furnace. The dramatic increase in waste for disposal led to the creation of the first incineration plants, or, as they were then called, 'destructors'. In 1874, the first incinerator was built in Nottingham by Manlove, Alliott & Co. Ltd. to the design of Alfred Fryer. However, these were met with opposition on account of the large amounts of ash they produced and which wafted over the neighbouring areas. Similar municipal systems of waste disposal sprung up at the turn of the 20th century in other large cities of Europe and North America. In 1895, New York City became the first U.S. city with public-sector garbage management. Early garbage removal trucks were simply open bodied dump trucks pulled by a team of horses. They became motorized in the early part of the 20th century and the first close body trucks to eliminate odours with a dumping lever mechanism were introduced in the 1920s in Britain. These were soon equipped with 'hopper mechanisms' where the scooper was loaded at floor level and then hoisted mechanically to deposit the waste in the truck. The Garwood Load Packer was the first truck in 1938, to incorporate a hydraulic compactor. In the 19th century, in the United States, cities often became choked with horse manure. While the odor was tolerable to 19th century sensitivities, walking through the streets without boots, resulted in deplorable appearing footwear. In many cities, lacking trash collection, pigs and dogs ran loose, consuming the trash, but excreting dung, which smelled offensively. Dead animals, particularly horses, were left lying in the streets, facilitating disease.

Actually, the band had split up following the 1988 album and remaining member, Les Evans, relocated from California to Oregon and reformed with three new members, including former Wehrmacht drummer, Brian Lehfeldt. The resulting album was quite a change in style for the band, moving from their hardcore punk roots more to a crossover thrash sound, complete with quirky rhythms and melodies.

Map of the Nora neighborhood in Indianapolis Nora is a community on the far north side of Indianapolis, Indiana. It is home to North Central High School and birthplace of the popular Monon Trail. Nora's neighborhoods typically feature diverse housing stock, large lots and mature trees. The Nora community contains six distinct business/commercial districts, including Nora Plaza, Greenbriar Plaza, and The Fashion Mall at Keystone. Nora is generally considered to be contained by White River on the east (southward around the Broad Ripple oxbow), Williams Creek and 79th Street on the south, Township Line Road on the west, and 96th Street (which forms the border between Marion and Hamilton counties) and I-465 on the north. Nora was never an incorporated town, so its accepted boundaries have varied. Today, the boundaries of Nora are commonly accepted as the area defined by the Nora-Northside Community Council. History The name Nora for this area can be traced back to December 1871, when Swedish immigrant Peter Lawson was appointed postmaster at Nora. Lawson owned a grocery store situated at what is today the southwest corner of Westfield Boulevard and 86th Street. Lawson named the area after his home parish in Sweden. He was born as Per Israelsson on March 29, 1828, in Blexbergstorp, Nora parish, √ñrebro County Sweden. He emigrated in 1854 and from at least 1860 he is known to have lived in Washington Township, Marion County. In 1861 he was one of the founding members of the Union Church Washington Township. Lawson died on October 29, 1884, and was buried in Crown Hill Cemetery. The locality of Nora grew around Lawson's grocery store and post office. Soon there were more shops, smithies, and a train station in the area. Nora Elementary School was opened in 1895. About 150 people lived in Nora in the 1880s, but the area did not become densely populated until the mid-1900s. Nora Plaza Shopping Center was built in 1959, anchored by an Ayr-Way that became a Target and a Standard that later became a Lowells No Frills Discount Foods, Wild Oats Market, and most recently Whole Foods. A new post office was opened in 1961 (a Steak 'n Shake is at the old location). Nora Community Council was established in 1967. It became part of Indianapolis under Unigov in 1970. Education Nora has a public library, a branch of the Indianapolis Public Library. Nora Elementary School, part of the Metropolitan School District of Washington Township, is in the neighborhood. as is North Central High School.

It opened on September 28, 2008. Interest in a landmark bridge across the Missouri River arose after Omaha and Council Bluffs began replacing their older crossings with girder bridges which do not have towers (most notably the Ak-Sar-Ben Bridge). The bridge is named after former Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey, who secured $18 million of federal funding for the bridge in 2000. The bridge was redesigned in 2004 after the lowest bid for the project was $44 million. In May 2006, a final cable-stayed bridge design by Kansas City engineering and architectural firm HNTB was selected for the bridge. The $22 million bid included two towers and a clearance of above the river. Groundbreaking for construction of the bridge occurred on October 26, 2006. The bridge is north of the Interstate 480 (I-480) girder bridge and connects the Port of Omaha's Miller Landing to One Renaissance Center in the former Dodge Park Playland in Council Bluffs. The lights on the bridge were donated by Gallup, which has their corporate headquarters and Gallup University located on the Missouri River adjacent the Omaha landing of the bridge. The bridge lights include programmable controls that can display multiple colors in the large lights at the top of the towers and alter brightness and timing of the lights that run the entire length of the bridge. The lights were officially unveiled in a ceremony on September 13, 2008. The bridge lights were turned on while the Phil Collins song \\"In The Air Tonight\\" was played over a PA system. The event was accompanied by fireworks. Due to safety concerns prompted by the 2011 Missouri River floods, the entrance on the Iowa side was closed on July 2 of that year. It reopened September 3, 2011. In 2015, the bridge joined Twitter as @BobTBridge, an effort by the Omaha Convention & Visitors Bureau.http://www.omaha.com/living/omaha-bridge-gains-ability-to-speak-joins- twitter/article_263b7ad0-265f-11e5-a54b-b39e4a60d2ab.html File:Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge.jpg|Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge at sunset File:Bobkerrypedbridge.jpg|Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge in spring See also *Trails in Omaha *List of crossings of the Missouri River *Parks in Omaha References External links Video walking tour of bridge Category:Bridges in Omaha, Nebraska Category:Pedestrian bridges in Iowa Category:Buildings and structures in Council Bluffs, Iowa Category:Cyclist bridges in the United States Category:Tourist attractions in Omaha, Nebraska Category:Bridges over the Missouri River Category:Bridges completed in 2008 Category:Cable-stayed bridges in the United States Category:Bridges in Pottawattamie County, Iowa Category:Pedestrian bridges in Nebraska Category:Girder bridges in the United States ","title":"Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge"},{"id":"7203736","text":"\\"Talkin' New York\\" is the second song on Bob Dylan's eponymous first album, released in 1962. A talking blues, the song describes his feelings on arriving in New York City from Minnesota, his time playing coffee houses in Greenwich Village, and his life as a folksinger without a record deal. The lyrics express the apparent difficulty he had finding gigs as a result of his unique sound, with a character in the song telling Dylan: \\"You sound like a hillbilly; We want folk singers here.\\"  Background  The song is the first of the two Dylan-penned songs to be heard on the album, the other being \\"Song To Woody.\\" This early example of Dylan's songwriting exhibits many traits which later became synonymous with his work. For example, the line A lot of people don't have much food on their table/But they got a lot of forks n' knives/And they gotta cut somethin'. Track 2. has been cited by many as an early example of Dylan's lyrical wit.Williams, P., (2004). Bob Dylan: performing artist. Omnibus Press. pp.32 The lines Now, a very great man once said/That some people rob you with a fountain pen. make specific reference to Woody Guthrie's \\"Pretty Boy Floyd\\". The song's structure and theme also bear similarities to Guthrie's \\"Talkin' Columbia\\", which Dylan had covered at least once in 1961, and \\"Talkin' Subway\\", with which one Dylan cataloguer drew an explicit connection. Both Guthrie and Dylan were both highly influenced by late 1920s country recording artist Chris Bouchillon, who first coined the term Talkin' Blues. US singer-songwriter Loudon Wainwright III, one of a small group of artists labelled 'new Bob Dylans' in their early career, recorded a critically acclaimed parody/tribute song called 'Talkin' New Bob Dylan' on his 1992 album 'History', to coincide with Dylan's 50th birthday.

Released on 27 September 2006 and promulgated on 1 October 2006, the Constitution allowed the junta to retain significant control over the appointed civilian government and the drafting of a permanent constitution. The CDR would be transformed into a permanent Council for National Security (CNS) and would appoint the head of the executive branch, the entire legislature, and the drafters of a permanent constitution. The Constitution made no mention of succession, instead leaving it to \\"constitutional practice.\\" The draft came under strong public criticism as being a step backwards from the 1997 \\"People's Constitution\\". The constitution did not repeal junta bans restricting freedom of speech, assembly, and political activity;Forbes, Main points of Thailand's military-backed interim constitution, 1 October 2006 these bans were subsequently revoked by an act on 27 December 2006. This interim constitution was replaced by the 2007 Constitution on 24 August 2007. Drafting process The junta appointed a legal panel to draft an interim charter. The team was led by former Senate speaker Meechai Ruchuphan, and originally included jurists Borwornsak Uwanno and Wissanu Krea-ngam. Both had played key roles in drafting the 1997 Constitution and had served under the deposed government, although they had resigned several months before the coup. Both resigned from the panel after public criticism that they were members of the ancien regime. Thammasat vice- rector Prinya Thewanaruemitkul harshly criticized the two, saying that they were \\"not honourable enough to look after the democratic system.\\" Both refused to play any further role with the military junta.The Nation, Wissanu, Borwornsak withdraw from team , 27 September 2006The Nation, Restore basic civil rights, NGOs urge , 24 September 2006 After the draft charter was promulgated, Meechai resigned as chief drafter; the junta appointed Jaran Pakdithanakul, former secretary to the Supreme Court president, as his replacement.The Nation, Meechai exits constitution panel after drawing flak , 2 October 2006 Key features The draft interim charter had 39 articles. Structurally, the draft interim charter was similar to the 1991 Constitution, the 1976 Constitution, and the 1959 Charter, in that it stipulated an extremely powerful executive branch which would appoint the entire legislature. The charter: *prescribes for the constitutional monarchy and the Kingdom of Thailand as the singular state (Art. 1) *guarantees basic rights, human dignity and equality under the law in accordance with the democratic rule under the king as head of state and international obligations (Art. 3) *outlines the formation and duties of the National Legislative Assembly, which will comprise 250 members appointed from professional groups, geographical areas and various sectors of society (Art. 5) *allows the National Legislative Assembly to request the Cabinet to give statements of fact or explain problems, but explicitly states that it may not make a vote of confidence or no confidence against the Cabinet (Art. 11) *grants immunity for remarks made on the floor (Art.13) *allows the Chairman of the Council for National Security (the junta) to remove the Prime Minister (Art. 14) *guarantees the independence of the judiciary (Art. 18) *spells out a process for drafting a permanent constitution. This includes the prohibition of the 100 members of the Constitution Drafting Council from being current members of a political party or being members of a political party for the previous 2 years (Art. 19) *empowers the Legislative Assembly speaker to chair the National Assembly (Art. 20) *spells out the peer-vote of a 2,000 member National Assembly to elect 200 candidates for the Constitutional Drafting Council. Each member can vote fore no more than three members, those nominated with the most votes will win. In the case of tied votes, which result in more than 200 winners, the winners will be decided by drawing lots. The peer-vote must complete in seven days (Art. 22). *empowers the Council of National Security to pick 100 of 200 CDC candidates for royal approval (Art. 22). *empowers the Council of National Security to appoint a 100-member CDC if the National Assembly fails to complete its selection within 7 days (Art. 23) *empowers the 100 CDC members to appoint 25 members of a Drafting Committee who may not be CDC members. The CNS will appoint another 10 members. (Art. 25) *forces the Drafting Committee to explain the differences between its draft and the 1997 Constitution.

Key concerns included: * The overwhelming power of the executive branch, particularly the Cabinet (appointed by a Premier who is in turn appointed by the junta) and the CNS. The CNS would also be allowed to take part in Cabinet meetings. * The lack of democratic elections for seats in the legislature. Under charter article 5, a 250-member National Legislative Assembly would be directly selected by the junta. This effectively meant that there would be no checks and balances to the junta's legislative and executive powers. * The lack of controls for the drafting of a permanent constitution. Under charter articles 19 and 21, the CNS would appoint a 2000-member National Assembly which would in 7 days have to select 200 of its members to be candidates for the Constitution Drafting Assembly. Under charter articles 22 and 24, the CNS would select 100 of those candidates for royal appointment to the Assembly; it would also select the Assembly head. The Assembly would then appoint 25 of its members as constitution writers, with the CNS directly appointing 10 writers. This process effectively gave the junta complete control over the permanent constitution. * The lack of controls to prevent members of the CNS, its panels, or its committees from running in elections. Under charter article 30, only the head of the CNS is banned. * The use of an old charter if the permanent constitution not completed by a CNS-set deadline. The specific charter to revert to was not specified - the CNS and the Cabinet would choose which of Thailand's 16 previous charters to use. Many critics called for the use of the 1997 Constitution. * The inability of the public to file written comments on the bills.The Nation, Interim charter draft , 27 September 2006 * The inclusion of King Bhumibol's theory of a self-sufficient economy in the preamble. * The granting of legal authority for the junta's post-coup announcements and orders, including bans against demonstrations and political activities (Article 36). * The granting of amnesty to the junta for executing the coup (Article 37). * Junta bans against political activities, political gatherings of more than five people, and limits on press freedom remained in place.IHT, Thai junta shores up role in politics, 1 October 2006 Banjerd Singkhaneti, of Thammasat University, noted of the process for drafting a permanent constitution, \\"I think it will be a mess and the next constitution will be just that.\\" Charoen Khumpeeraparp, of Silpakorn University, criticized the charter for protecting human rights according to commitments made under international treaties, claiming that it would not allow persecution of figures in the deposed government. Charoen claimed that no other countries let international commitments influence their local laws.The Bangkok Post, Draft charter loopholes can 'resurrect Thaksin regime', 28 September 2006 However, the draft interim charter did call for one democratic innovation: it required that a permanent constitution would have to be ratified by public referendum. This innovation was suggested in the draft 1974 Constitution, but was rejected by the royally-appointed Constitutional Convention. Nonetheless, the referendum proposal too has been condemned, as if the draft is rejected then under section 32 of the interim charter it is returned to the junta, which will write a constitution of its own in consultation with the Council of Ministers.Asian Human Rights Commission, THAILAND: MILITARY COUP - Constitutional fictions, 9 October 2006 The interim charter was also criticized for being drafted without considering the views of the public. Meechai Ruchuphan, chief legal advisor for the junta, had earlier promised to heed opposing legal opinions. Komsan Phokong (Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University), Charoen Kampheeraphap (Silapakorn University), and Sasatra Toon (Rangsit University) had then sought and received the permission from the junta to present an alternative draft charter comprising 72 articles. \\"Meechai had promised to heed opposing legal opinions but failed to honour his word,\\" Komsan said. Sasatra said Meechai acted like he was trying to perpetuate the power of the junta.The Nation, Law lecturers attack interim charter , 30 September 2006 On 28 September, 6 scholars from Chiang Mai University and Midnight University protested the draft interim charter by dressing in black and tearing a mock-up of the draft in a press conference. The 6 included historian Nidhi Eawseewong, Worawit Charoenlert, Somchai Preecha-silpakul, Chatchawan Boonpan, Kriengsak Chetwattanawanich and Somkiat Tangnamo. The website of Midnight University was later shut down in response.The Nation, Midnight University website shut down after protest , 1 October 2006 Thitinan Pongsudhirak of Chulalongkorn University noted that the charter was \\"alarming\\" and that \\"The problem for the military is that they are in deep now. They haven't done what they set out to do, which was to get rid of Thaksin, hand over power to a civilian government and step aside. They have not stepped aside.\\" Suriyasai Katasila, a key member of the anti-Thaksin People's Alliance for Democracy, criticized the charter for not containing restrictions which would bar seats in the National Legislative Assembly from former members and affiliates of Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai party.The Nation, Academics: no consensus , 2 October 2006 Khomsan Phokhong, of Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University, demanded greater public participation in the charter-drafting process as well as restrictions against participation by members and affiliates of the Thai Rak Thai party. Somkhid Lertphaithoon, Deputy Rector of Thammasat University, demanded that the junta directly appoint 100 members to the Constitution Drafting Assembly rather than rely on a 2000-member National Assembly. He also called the interim constitution the best of its kind although he was disappointed it did not include a mission statement. Somchai Siripreechakul, Dean of Law at Chiang Mai University, urged Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont to call a general election as soon as possible and hand the task of drafting a charter to the elected parliament.The Nation, Poll should precede new charter: law experts , 2 October 2006 The International Herald Tribune noted that the interim charter \\"appears to buttress the military's role in Thai politics.\\" Among human rights groups, the Hong Kong-based regional body the Asian Human Rights Commission has issued a series of statements condemning the interim charter as a work of \\"constitutional fiction\\".Asian Human Rights Commission, THAILAND: MILITARY COUP - Constitutional fictions, 9 October 2006; see also THAILAND: MILITARY COUP - How to make courts independent?, 6 October 2006; THAILAND: MILITARY COUP - The right man for what job?, 4 October 2006 Permanent constitution In December, the 2,000-member junta-appointed National Assembly elected 200 of its members as candidates for the Constitution Drafting Assembly. The voting was fraught with irregularities. The candidate with the highest number of votes was Okas Tepalakul from Chachoengsao province, a virtually unknown car dealership owner who was a former classmate of junta-head Sonthi Boonyaratglin. BMW Thailand executive Pharani Leenuthapong received the second highest number of votes. The controversial selection also saw Suwit Pipatwilaikul, a little-known Nong Bua Lamphu construction contractor who received the third highest number of votes. There were no representatives of farmers or workers in the final selection. Of the 200 final nominees, the nominee that received the lowest number of votes received just 7 votes. Assembly-member Maj Pol Gen Krerk Kalayanimitr claimed that some votes may have been bought. Of the 200 nominees, 74 were public sector bureaucrats, 34 were academics, 38 were from the social sector, and 54 were from the private sector.Bangkok Post, 200 shortlisted to draft new charter, 19 December 2006The Nation, Eyebrows raised over CDA selections , 19 December 2006 The voting itself was full of irregularities. Members were lobbied in front of toilets and many Assembly-members marked their ballots before entering the polling booths (Normally, voters are handed ballot papers only when they enter the booth). A soldier guarding the entrance to the Parliament stopped a woman carrying 400,000 baht in cash. She refused to say why she was carrying so much money.The Nation, Sonthi's classmate gets most votes, 20 December 2006 In December, junta chief Sonthi Boonyaratglin issued several guidelines for the permanent constitution being drafted by the CNS's drafting body. These included: * Restricting a Prime Minister to serving a maximum of two terms of office * Preventing a government from acting as a caretaker administration after dissolving Parliament. * Making it easier to launch a no-confidence debate against the Prime Minister. Whereas the 1997 Constitution required 200 out of the House's 500 MPs to launch a no-confidence debate against the Prime Minister, Sonthi demanded that 100 MPs be sufficient. He also made several suggestions, including: * Transforming the Senate from an all-elected body in order to prevent relatives of politicians from being elected and thus perverting the non-partisan intent of the 1997 Constitution. * Allowing politicians to switch political parties at any time. The 1997 Constitution required that any candidate for the House belong to a political party for 90 days before the registration date for an election. * Banning the merger of political parties.The Nation, Sonthi issues guidelines for new charter , 17 December 2006 Sonthi later denied dictating the content for the new constitution, but stated \\"We can't force them to do things but responsible people will know what the constitution should look like.\\"The Nation, No dictatation on the charter : CNS chief , 20 December 2006 See also * 2006 Thai coup d'√©tat * Constitution of Thailand * Council for National Security * Sonthi Boonyaratglin References Category:Defunct constitutions of Thailand Interim Constitution of Thailand Interim Constitution of Thailand Category:Provisional constitutions ","title":"2006 interim constitution of Thailand"},{"id":"7203943","text":"Location of Trebi≈°ov District in the Region Vi≈°≈àov (; ) is a village and municipality in the Trebi≈°ov District in the Ko≈°ice Region of south-eastern Slovakia.

Naver established itself as an early pioneer in the use of user-generated content through the creation of the online Q&A; platform Knowledge iN. Naver also manages global mobile services such as the mobile messenger LINE, video messenger Snow, and group communication service BAND. On August 1, 2013, Naver decided to split with Hangame, a corporation which it had grown together with as NHN Corporation for 13 years. On October 1, 2013, the company adopted its current name Naver Corporation in order to reflect the change. Hangame is now overseen by NHN Entertainment. Naver's current affiliates include Line Corporation, Snow, Naver Labs, Naver Webtoon, Naver Business Platform, and Works Mobile. The company is currently cooperating with IT startups in order to evolve into a tech-based platform. History  1999‚Äì2000: Establishment and launch of services  Naver Corporation was first established in June 1999 under the name of Naver Comm. Along with its search engine Naver, the company also launched a service for children named Junior Naver. In July 2000, Naver merged with Hangame Communications Inc. and several other companies including Oneque and Search Solutions. In August 2000, Naver began its 'comprehensive search' service, which allows users to get a variety of results from a search query on a single page, organized by type (for example blogs, webpages, images, cafes, etc.) In September 2000, Naver established Hangame Japan.  2001‚Äì2012: Renaming and worldwide expansion  In 2001, NAVER Comm was renamed NHN Corporation (Next Human Network), although both divisions‚ÄîNaver and Hangame‚Äîcontinued to operate under their original brand names. NHN also stood for (NAVER, Hangame, Network). In 2002, NHN was registered in KOSDAQ and launched the online Q&A; service, Naver Knowledge iN.

That same year, NHN had the largest market capitalization among KOSDAQ-listed companies before being transferred to the KOSPI market in November. In 2009, Kim Sang-Hun of NHN and Jing-Wan Kim of Samsung were the only South Korean CEOs to appear on Asia's Fab 50. In 2010 NHN bought Livedoor, a Japanese ISP and blog platform. In the same year, the company moved into its new headquarters now known as the Green Factory. In June 2011, NHN Japan launched Line, a messaging application that quickly soared in usage. In 2012, NHN announced that it planned to invest 1.5 billion South Korean won (approximately 1.35 million US dollars) in developing ten social media games. In the same year, NHN Japan, Naver Japan and Livedoor were all merged into one company: NHN Japan. In August, NHN also established its Singapore branch NHN Singapore.  2013‚Äì2015: Splitting from NHN  In 2013, NHN launched its subsidiary companies Camp Mobile and Line Plus. NHN is split into Naver Corporation and NHN Entertainment, the latter being formerly known as Hangame. Similarly, NHN Japan separated into Line Corporation (web services) and Hangame Japan (game services). In June, Naver became the first web company in Korea to build and operate its own data center, Data Center GAK, which was built in Chuncheon, Gangwon Province. In 2015, Naver launched Works Mobile for B2B collaboration businesses and merged with Entry Education Labs, which is a software education platform company.

However, it shut down in June 2014, due to poor performance against global competitors such as Twitter and Facebook.  Subsidiary companies   Line  LINE Corporation was established in September 2000 as NHN Japan, and is nowadays regarded as the global subsidiary of Naver Corporation. The firm manages various services centering on its core product, the LINE Messenger, which is a free communication service available on both mobile and PC devices. Functions such as unique emoticons, stickers, and emojis contribute to its popularity as it has gathered 220 million monthly active users (MAU) in 230 countries since its launch in 2011.

It primarily handles global business operations, marketing, and partnerships for countries outside of Japan. It is located in Seohyun-si Bundang-gu South Korea and employs 1,785 people including CEO Shin Jung-ho.  CAMP Mobile  CAMP Mobile was established in March 2013 and focuses on developing mobile services. While it originally began as a small venture project, Camp Mobile launched over 10 different apps in areas such as utilities, social networking, and e-commerce within four months of its establishment. BAND, CAMP Mobile's first app released in August 2012, is a closed type of social network where groups can be formed according to type and purpose.

Green Factory  Green Factory Library Green Factory Louvers Naver's headquarters, located in Bundang-gu Seongnam-si of South Korea, is referred to as the Green Factory. The construction of the Green Factory was completed in March 2010 with 27 floors above ground and 7 floors underground. The interior of the building was designed to provide as open an environment as possible, where the company's culture and values would be reflected. The intent was to create a working space which fosters better communication between employees. Green Factory's office spaces are designed like pods, which focus on a central open meeting area. Most of the central meeting spaces have non-traditional furniture and match the casual atmosphere represented throughout the rest of the interior. The emergency stairs sport different patterns or designs instead of the typical painted concrete finish. The building also has special facilities including a library and a magazine area, which are both open to the public, a cafeteria, an exercise center, and a healthcare center. The steel and glass fa√ßade houses adjustable vertical louvers which restrict or allow sunlight to enter the building. The louvers are automatically closed and opened at times of sunrise and sunset, allowing the building to save energy. On special occasions, the fa√ßade displays different images such as the company's logo. Internal light is selectively blocked by a nocturnal automated louver system. The building is certified as 'platinum' under the global green building design rating system LEED.  Global offices  Naver currently holds global offices in Japan, US, China, Vietnam, Taiwan, and Thailand.

Biography page at CarbonAngel. Green vehicles Malewicki spent the past 25 years advancing the Skytran concept: ultra-light computer- controlled cars hanging below aluminum Maglev (magnetic levitation) tracks that could be supported above roads just by utility poles or the sides of buildings. Skytran basically combines maglev (which allows high speeds) and a hanging design (more stable; smaller tracks) with the 1960s idea of Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) -- cars individual commuters take directly to their destination (hence \\"Personal\\"), but computer-driven and available to others after they exit (hence \\"Transit\\"). Another key PRT idea Skytran follows is exiting the main track for boarding; so the cars behind don't need to wait as they do with mass transit vehicles.

It has been published in South America, Spain and Italy, among other places. Overview Dago tells the story a 16th-century Venetian nobleman who is betrayed and stabbed in the back by his best friend as part of a political plot during which his family is murdered and framed for treason. He is found adrift in the sea with the dagger still in his back by an Ottoman ship whose crewmembers save him, enslave him and baptize him \\"Dago\\" in reference to the dagger that, like a mother, gives him a new life as a slave. As he realizes he's still alive, he swears vengeance on the four men that took part in the conspiracy to destroy his family. As a slave, he passes through several stages of the slave trade. He eventually becomes a rebel leader fighting for the Arab rebels in the desert against the Empire only to be captured and become a slave once again. He saves Barbarossa's life which leads him to become a Janissary and eventually the Vizier's right-hand man. Later he's sent as a special envoy to the French Court, guarding a fortune in gold and jewels to be used as a bribe for King Francis who will use it as funds for his war against Spain. Dago participates in several battles and political plots defending the King from common enemies. This leads to his taking part in the Sack of Rome (1527) first as an invader and, later, as a defender of the city. He has many romantic and sexual relationships throughout his life, including a fairly passionate affair with the French King's sister Marguerite, but they always end with the woman's death or his parting, moving on with his missions and voyages. He has at least one son, the result of a short-lived relationship with the daughter of a leader of a caravan on the Silk Route, prophesied to be a great warrior and leader in the future but fated never to meet his father. After obtaining his revenge, he continues to travel around Europe, America, Africa and Asia, meeting several famous characters of history, but always living a solitary life.

Biography Mitchell was born in Whately, Alabama, but he moved with his parents to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, when he was eight. He played the bugle in school and wanted to play trumpet. However, the school band needed a trombonist and reportedly Mitchell's long arms fit the task. He was a member of the school's orchestra with Ahmad Jamal and Dakota Staton. At sixteen, he played with King Kolax's territory band in Indiana. In 1951 he joined the U.S. Marines and played in a military band. After being discharged in 1953, he moved to San Francisco, where he worked with Earl Hines, Lionel Hampton, and Duke Ellington. From 1962‚Äì1970, he was a member of the Count Basie Orchestra. Mitchell had been a fan of Tommy Dorsey, as Count Basie told him he sounded like him. He spent the next decade working in television and movies, then returned to Basie's orchestra in 1980 and remained with it until his death in 1984. Thad Jones became leader of the orchestra, followed by Frank Foster, then Mitchell in 1995. As bandleader, Mitchell won the Grammy Award for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album for Live at Manchester Craftsmen's Guild (1996) and Count Plays Duke (1998) He died of cancer in New York at the age of 73.https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-aug-09-me-mitchell9-story.html Discography As leader * Meet Grover Mitchell (Jazz Chronicles, 1979) * The Devil's Waltz (Jazz Chronicles, 1980) * Live at the Red Parrot (Hemisphere, 1984) * Grover Mitchell & His Orchestra (Stash, 1987) * Truckin ' (Stash, 1987) * Hip Shakin' (Ken, 1990) * Live at Manchester Craftsmen's Guild (1996) with by the Count Basie Orchestra * On Track with his New Blue Devils (Quixotic Records, 1997) * Count Plays Duke with by the Count Basie Orchestra (MAMA, 1998) * Swing Shift (MAMA/Summit, 1999) * Grover Mitchell Big Band (Storyville, 2004) As sideman With Count Basie * On My Way & Shoutin' Again!

He was known as Sir James Kitson from 1886, until he was elevated to the peerage in 1907. Lord Airedale was a prominent Unitarian in Leeds, Yorkshire. Life James Kitson's parents were James Kitson (1807‚Äì1885) a self-made locomotive manufacturer who founded Kitson and Company, and his wife Ann (Anne) of Elmete Hall in Leeds. They had many children. One of them, Emily, married the royal obstetrician William Smoult Playfair in 1864, and thus became inadvertently involved in a court case with implications for medical ethics that still resonate today. Kitson attended school in Wakefield and studied chemistry and natural sciences at University College London. The loss of his first wife Emily in 1873 was devastating. His sister-in-law Clara Talbot (n√©e Cliff, died 1905), and her husband Grosvenor Talbot were described as \\"lifelines\\", \\"tending to the grieving man and looking after his children\\". Kitson and Talbot were college friends. Four years later Kitson suffered another blow with the death of his older brother Frederick, a \\"gifted engineer\\". Gledhow Hall In 1885 Kitson purchased Gledhow Hall in Gledhow, Leeds. He redecorated the hall and entertained lavishly including playing host to Prime Minister William Gladstone and his son, Herbert, who was a witness at Kitson's second marriage to Mary Laura Smith in 1881. He commissioned Burmantofts Pottery to create an elaborate bathroom of faience, glazed architectural terra-cotta, in honour of a visit from the Prince of Wales circa 1885. Career In 1854, when Kitson was aged nineteen, his father bought the ironworks at Monk Bridge and put him and his elder brother, Frederick, in charge. Monkbridge was amalgamated with their father's Airedale Foundry in 1858. In 1886 the business was a limited liability company under family control with ¬£250,000 in capital. Frederick Kitson withdrew from the business because of ill health several years before his death in 1877. Kitson's father retired in 1876 but James Kitson in reality ran the firm from 1862. The Airedale Foundry built nearly 6,000 locomotives for use in Britain and abroad from when it was founded until the end of the 19th century. The company diversified into manufacturing stationary engines for agricultural use and steam engines for tramways. From the 1880s, the Monkbridge works made steel using the Siemens‚ÄìMartin open-hearth process. The Airedale Foundry and Monkbridge Works both employed about 2000 workers in 1911. In connection with his business interests Kitson was a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers from 1859 and was president of the Iron Trade Association. He was president of the Iron and Steel Institute in 1889 and was awarded the institute's Bessemer gold medal in 1903. Between 1899 and 1901, he was a member of the council of the Institution of Civil Engineers. Kitson's other interests included the London and Northern Steamship Company, the Yorkshire Banking Company. He was a director of the London City and Midland Bank and president of the Baku Russian Petroleum Company. He was also a director of the North Eastern Railway Company. He was president of the Leeds Chamber of Commerce from 1880 to 1881. Financial success allowed Kitson time, money and influence to pursue other interests including politics. He was President of the Leeds Liberal Association, and ran the election campaign for William Ewart Gladstone. In 1880, Kitson was a committee member of the Leeds Trained Nurses Institution. He was MP for Colne Valley from 1892 until 1907, supporting education, Irish Home Rule, and old age pensions. Kitson was a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. He supported the Mechanics' Institute and the Yorkshire College, the forerunner of the University of Leeds, which awarded him an honorary doctorate, DSc in 1904. Kitson was never a member of Leeds Council but was the city's first lord mayor in 1896‚Äì7. He was created a baronet in 1886 and was sworn of the Privy Council in 1906. On 17 July 1907 Kitson was raised to the peerage as the first Baron Airedale, of Gledhow in the West Riding of the County of York. Death Airedale died following a heart attack in Paris at the Hotel Meurice on 16 March 1911. He had been returning home by train from the south of France. His funeral service was held at Mill Hill Chapel on 22 March before his body was taken for burial to Roundhay Church along a route lined by 4000 workpeople. A subsequent memorial service at St Margaret's Church in Westminster was attended by a hundred MPs. Mill Hill Chapel The Kitsons were closely linked to Mill Hill Chapel, the Unitarian church on Leeds City Square made famous by the ministry of Joseph Priestley a century before. In 1897 Kitson paid for an extension to the vestry. William Morris designed a window which was dedicated to Kitson's mother Ann, who died in 1865. After his death, Archibald Keightley Nicholson created a window in his name, representing the continuation of Christianity.Memorial Window to the Late Lord Airedale. Report of the Proceedings at the Unveiling Ceremony ... Together with a Description of the Window. 8 page booklet published by the chapel. In the early-20th century the chapel had \\"a small but politically active and very influential congregation led by the Reverend Charles Hargrove and Sir James Kitson\\". The 1899 House of Commons Parliamentary Papers record Kitson as contributing to a Parliamentary inquiry into the Religious Education for Dissenting Protestants. Family Kitson married Emily Christina Cliff on 20 September 1860. Emily was involved in the establishment of the Yorkshire Ladies Council of Education alongside Frances Lupton. Kitson and his wife Emily had issue: * Sir Albert Ernest Kitson, 2nd Baron Airedale (1863‚Äì1944) * James Clifford Kitson (6 December 1864 25 September 1942) * Charles Clifford Kitson twin of James Clifford (born 6 December 1864) * Emily (born 1866) * Edward Christian (born 1873) * (Alice) Hilda (1872‚Äì1944) Kitson married Mary Laura Smith (died 1939) on 1 June 1881 and had issue: * Sir Roland Dudley Kitson, 3rd Baron Airedale (1882‚Äì1958) * Olive Mary (born 1887) Mayors and lord mayors Several members of the Kitson family were mayor or Lord Mayor of Leeds: *In 1860 and 1861, James Kitson *In 1896 and 1897, his son, Sir James Kitson MP (later the 1st Baron Airedale) *In 1908 (and briefly in 1910), Frederick J Kitson *In 1942, Jessie Beatrice Kitson Lord Airedale's father, James Kitson was Mayor of Leeds in 1860‚Äì1861.

GH). Manufactured by Merck Serono, Saizen is produced by recombinant DNA technology from a mammalian cell line (mouse C127) that was modified by the addition of the human GH gene, resulting in an identical 191-amino acid sequence and structure. Usage Saizen is injected. It is intended for long- term treatment of individuals who are growth hormone deficient. Saizen, like all synthetic somatropin, has special importance for children and adolescents whose growth failure is due to inadequate production of growth hormone. Studies have shown that somatropin usage fails to produce athletic performance enhancement despite claims to the contrary. More recently, Saizen has been used in IVF protocols by a few physicians for female patients undergoing infertility treatment in an attempt to increase the number and quality of oocytes retrieved. It affects: *Tissue growth **Skeletal growth **Cell growth (especially muscle growth) **Organ growth *Metabolism **Protein metabolism **Carbohydrate metabolism **Lipid metabolism **Mineral metabolism **Connective tissue and bone metabolism Saizen usage should be performed under the regular guidance of a physician who is experienced in the diagnosis and management of growth hormone deficiency. Individuals with inadequate secretion of growth hormone sometimes experience fasting hypoglycemia that is improved by treatment with growth hormone. Using Saizen may decrease glucose tolerance. Because human growth hormone may induce a state of insulin resistance, patients should be observed for evidence of glucose intolerance. As with all human growth hormone supplementation, Saizen should be used with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus or a family history of diabetes mellitus. Warnings: Black-Market HGH Those seeking HGH (Human Growth Hormone) therapy without a prescription from licensed physicians must be aware that there are several fake HGH manufacturers floating around the web. Most of these manufacturers actually use a substance called hCG (Human chorionic gonadotropin) and pass it off as Generic HGH, and since testing the HGH chemical substance is a very expensive process, the bootleggers know that most, if not all, of their customers wouldn‚Äôt even attempt to test them. The majority of fake HGH on the market is manufactured in China only, The color of the caps on the bottles offers no discernible way to tell if it is real HGH or fake, Blue, Green, Grey, Red tops are all used and so the color of the top alone is not enough to prove or disprove if its real.

One of the historical sources for this theory is the study of trigonometric series. Formulation In symbols, the assumption :LM = ML, where the left-hand side means that M is applied first, then L, and vice versa on the right-hand side, is not a valid equation between mathematical operators, under all circumstances and for all operands. An algebraist would say that the operations do not commute. The approach taken in analysis is somewhat different. Conclusions that assume limiting operations do 'commute' are called formal. The analyst tries to delineate conditions under which such conclusions are valid; in other words mathematical rigour is established by the specification of some set of sufficient conditions for the formal analysis to hold good. This approach justifies, for example, the notion of uniform convergence. It is relatively rare for such sufficient conditions to be also necessary, so that a sharper piece of analysis may extend the domain of validity of formal results. Professionally speaking, therefore, analysts push the envelope of techniques, and expand the meaning of well-behaved for a given context. G. H. Hardy wrote that \\"The problem of deciding whether two given limit operations are commutative is one of the most important in mathematics\\".In an Appendix A note on double limit operations to A Course of Pure Mathematics. An opinion apparently not in favour of the piece-wise approach, but of leaving analysis at the level of heuristic, was that of Richard Courant. Examples Examples abound, one of the simplest being that for a double sequence am,n: it is not necessarily the case that the operations of taking the limits as m ‚Üí ‚àû and as n ‚Üí ‚àû can be freely interchanged. For example take :am,n = 2m ‚àí n in which taking the limit first with respect to n gives 0, and with respect to m gives ‚àû. Many of the fundamental results of infinitesimal calculus also fall into this category: the symmetry of partial derivatives, differentiation under the integral sign, and Fubini's theorem deal with the interchange of differentiation and integration operators. One of the major reasons why the Lebesgue integral is used is that theorems exist, such as the dominated convergence theorem, that give sufficient conditions under which integration and limit operation can be interchanged. Necessary and sufficient conditions for this interchange were discovered by Federico Cafiero.

He was known for his accurate passing on the field and wisecracking off the field. Bramwell replaced Jimmy Tansey at left-back in September 1958 and kept his place in the side for the rest of the season. He was a steady performer but lacked a bit of pace and over committed to challenges sometimes leaving him stranded. In his second season at Goodison John had to contest his place with Tommy Jones who had moved there for centre- half. John left Everton as part of the deal that brought Billy Bingham from Luton Town and showed the best form of his career while there. John Bramwell made 56 appearances for Everton but never scored.

Biography He was born at Milan, presumably of the noble family of de Magni. He received the Capuchin habit at Prague. He was also provincial superior there, as in 1626 was appointed Apostolic missionary for Germany, Hungary and Poland. He was greatly respected by Holy Roman Emperors Ferdinand II and Ferdinand III, as well as by King Wladislaw IV of Poland, who employed him on diplomatic missions. In July 1647 he performed a vacuum experiment (so-called Torricelli's experiment) before a distinguished audience at the Royal Castle in Warsaw. Landgrave Ernst of Hesse, who had been converted at Vienna on 6 January 1652, and who knew Father Valerian, summoned Capuchins to St. Goar on the Rhine, and was present at the religious disputation between Valerian and Haberkorn of Giessen at Burg Rheinfels in 1651. The Jesuit Johann Rosenthal having attacked certain assertions of Valerian's at this debate, the latter was drawn into the sharp literary controversy between Capuchins and Jesuits, which extended even to Rome. On the appearance of his pamphlet Contra imposturas Jesuitarum in 1659, he was cited to appear at Rome. As he did not obey the summons he was arrested at Vienna in 1661 at the instance of the nuncio, but was liberated at the urgent request of Ferdinand III. He was apparently on his way to Rome when in the same year death overtook him at Salzburg.

(short for Cosmopolitan; Malay: Kosmopolitan) is a Malay language compact format newspaper tabloid in Malaysia owned by the Utusan Group, which also owns Kosmo! Sunday paper Kosmo! Ahad, Utusan Malaysia, and Mingguan Malaysia. It is available in Malaysia at most newsstands. History Kosmo! was launched on 30 August 2004 by Prime Minister Dato‚Äô Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. All the sections in this newspaper use an exclamation mark (!). Formerly, Kosmo! was sold in Malaysia at a price of 80 cents daily excluding Sundays, when it was sold at RM 1.00 under a different name, that is Kosmo Ahad. However, by April 2007, Kosmo! priced at RM1.00 per day, while on Sundays it is sold at RM1.20. As of July 2016, it is priced at RM1.00 for both Kosmo! and Kosmo Ahad. Despite initial reports in mid-August 2019 that the Utusan Group would be shutting down its newspaper operations including Kosmo!, Kosmo! Ahad, Utusan Malaysia, and Mingguan Malaysia, the company retracted its decision after receiving a RM1.6 million cash injection from the United Malays National Organisation. However, the Utusan Group announced that they will be raising Kosmo! Ahad price from RM1.00 to RM1.50 and shifting to a new business model. Despite attempts to salvage Kosmo! and its sister newspapers, the Utusan Group executive chairman Datuk Abd Aziz Sheikh Fadzir announced that the company's newspapers would cease publication on 10 October 2019 due to poor cash flow, mounting debts and declining sales. Staff were given a few hours to clear their belongings from the Utusan Group headquarters. The four Utusan newspapers are expected to resume publication on 1 November 2019 under a new management. Aurora Mulia, a company linked to business tycoon Syed Mokhtar Al-Bukhary, had reportedly acquired 70 percent of Utusan's wholly owned subsidiary Dilof Sdn Bhd. However, only some of the 862 redundant employees would be rehired. In January 2020, it was reported that Kosmo!, along with its sister newspaper, Utusan Malaysia is set to be revived soon, as some sources in the industry confirming that newspaper‚Äôs new management has recruiting staff to start working in February.

High Raise is a fell in the English Lake District, standing to the west of Haweswater Reservoir in the Far Eastern Fells. Note that another High Raise is the highpoint of the Central Fells. Topography High Raise is on the main north-south spine of the Far Eastern Fells between Wether Hill and Rampsgill Head. Its eastern slopes drop to Haweswater and its western flank is the steep scree-lined side of Rampsgill. The main ridge north to Wether Hill passes over the two intermediate tops of Raven Howe (2,345 ft) and Red Crag (2,332 ft), before dropping to the depression of Keasgill Head. This ridge is grassy but quite narrow and carries the High Street Roman road. There is a small tarn to the south of Red Crag. In the other direction the ridge turns a little westward across a narrow depression to Rampsgill Head. East of High Raise, about half a mile away, is its companion Low Raise (2,473 ft). This broad top carries a tumulus of bleached stones, some of which have since been used to form a cairn and wind shelter. The stones do not appear native to their location. East of Low Raise the craggy bowl of Whelter Crags is gouged out of the hillside above the reservoir. Two ridges run north and south around it to the shore. The more extensive north-east ridge, Long Grain, curves around between Measand Beck and Whelter Bottom. Its top begins as a wide plateau before giving way to crags above Haweswater. The south-east ridge gradually narrows, becoming rockier before taking a final plunge over Castle Crag. This is the site of an ancient hill-fort and some earthworks are just about discernible. South of this ridge, separating it from Kidsty Pike, is Randale. Summit The summit of High Raise is stony, particularly in comparison to its neighbours, and a large cairn has been raised up a few yards east of the Roman road. The views westward provide a fine Lakeland panorama.Alfred Wainwright:A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 2: Ascents Ascents can be made from Martindale to the north or from Mardale via the south east and north east ridges. High Raise can also be climbed as part of a longer walk from Patterdale, Hartsop or Bampton, but other fells need to be ascended first. There are few good paths on the fell, other than the High Street. This is due in part to the loss of Mardale Green village when the lake was raised in the mid 1930s.

It shared the Booker Prize that year with Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient. The story is set in the mid 18th century and centres on the Liverpool Merchant, a slave ship employed in the triangular trade, a central trade route in the Atlantic slave trade. The two main characters are cousins Erasmus Kemp, son of a wealthy merchant from Lancashire and Matthew Paris, a physician and scientist who goes on the voyage. The novel's central theme is greed, with the subject of slavery being a primary medium for exploring the issue. The story line has a very extensive cast of characters, some featuring in only one scene, others continually developed throughout the story, but most described in intricate detail. The narrative interweaves elements of appalling cruelty and horror with extended comedic interludes, and employs frequent period expressions. A sequel, The Quality of Mercy, was published in 2011; it was Unsworth's last book. Plot synopsis The novel begins in England during the Age of Enlightenment but long before the days of Darwin and the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. The novel is broken into two books, beginning in 1752 and 1753 and ending in 1765, with a decade or so separating the two. Matthew Paris is a central character in the novel, a physician several years older than his cousin Erasmus. Prior to the beginning of the story Paris had been imprisoned for writings on the age of the earth that clashed with a literal interpretation of the Bible, his wife Ruth dying while he was incarcerated. Wishing to escape his past, he accepts a position as surgeon on the Liverpool Merchant, a slave ship built and owned by his uncle William Kemp. The elder Kemp's son, Erasmus Kemp, a young man in his early twenties, has a long- standing hatred for his cousin dating back to his younger years. He participates in a play initially, and is enamored with seventeen-year-old Sarah Wolpert, the daughter of a friend of his father. The ship's crew is made up of men available at the time around the Liverpool docks, and many are recruited by blackmail and deception. As the ship sets off toward the African continent to collect its cargo, it becomes clear that Paris and the ship's captain, Saul Thurso, have very different world views. Book One The book's chapters switch between episodic relations of events on the Liverpool Merchant, the senior Kemp's slave ship, and domestic developments in Liverpool. On the ship, Paris finds himself travelling down the coast of West Africa among a crew of men who despise being on the ship but have few other options. Some form friendships with him, while others are more inhospitable. While the crew are treated harshly under the ruthless discipline of Captain Thurso, Paris enjoys a different level of treatment; as the nephew of the ship's owner, he is mocked and belittled but treated as an elite member of the crew. Tensions between these two men arise early and build throughout the voyage. As they reach the coast of Guinea, Paris learns that the slaves are recruited by the local Kru people, who 'hunt' for slaves further inland. Slaves are bartered for trade goods of little value such as slave beads and kettles, with the captain haggling with the local traders. Questions are raised regarding the deliberate exchange of faulty weapons with native slave traders. Back in England Erasmus is falling in love with a local girl named Sarah Wolpert. He participates in The Enchanted Island on her suggestion, a rewritten play with characters and dialogue drawn from Shakespeare's The Tempest. The two start a relationship, but Erasmus is very possessive, and conflicts ensue. Meanwhile, Kemp's father, a cotton broker, is in financial trouble, relying heavily on strong profits from the voyage of the Merchant. As slaves come aboard, Paris becomes increasingly concerned with their living conditions and general treatment. He is joined on the ship by Delblanc, an artist and philosopher who shares a similar stature with him on the ship, and with whom he exchanges views on subjects such as authority. The voyage is unlike anything he expected, the slaves taking on a defiant stance. They attempt to take their own lives, with the crew trying to prevent them from doing so. With disease and death already frequent on board the ship, dysentery then strikes. The writings in Paris' journal and his exchanges with those on board show his growing disgust with the slave trade, and he comes to question his motives for coming on the voyage and his role in assisting the slave traders. Meanwhile, William Kemp commits suicide owing to fear of his imminent bankruptcy. Erasmus, now planning to marry Sarah, is offered a job by her father, a wealthy business man. Too proud to accept his pity, he turns away from the Wolpert family, aiming to rebuild his father's empire. The situation on board the Merchant continues to deteriorate. Thurso cuts the ship's rations, trying to keep as many slaves alive as possible. Death continues, the corpses tossed overboard. Thurso throws a monkey overboard, a pet brought on board by one of the seamen. The crew begin to rebel against him, and he becomes paranoid, keeping to his own quarters. Finally, Thurso decides to throw the remaining slaves overboard, the insurance money being more attractive than their prospects for sale in a sickened state. As he attempts to have them tossed into the ocean, chains and all, the shipmates revolt. As the first part of the book ends, the fate of the Liverpool Merchant remains unclear. Book Two Roughly a decade on, the second part of the book initially focuses on the fate of Erasmus. Having recovered from bankruptcy and the shame of his father's death, he has married into a wealthy family. His wife Margaret is the daughter of a wealthy man, Sir Hugo, President of the West India Association. Their marriage is clearly one of mere convenience. It seems sure that the Liverpool Merchant has been lost at sea in bad weather. However, Kemp soon learns from another captain that the ship is beached on the southeastern coast of Florida in the Americas. The ship's crew and slaves are said to be living together in a small inland settlement, trading with the local Indians. Seeking retribution against his cousin, Kemp takes a ship to Florida. In St. Augustine he manages to obtain a small force of infantry equipped with cannon to capture the crew. The ship's crew and slaves have been living together in a community for over a decade, speaking a trade pidgin from the Guinea coast. The few women are shared among the men, many of which now have children. Paris has a son with a woman named Tabakali, who he shares with another man. The small community live in a primitive fashion, having a simple anarchist‚Äìsocialist political system. Life is peaceful in general though, even utopian. The translator tells the children stories in a pidgin tongue which they all share, while Paris reads to them from Alexander Pope and David Hume. Erasmus finds Paris' journal among the wreckage of the Merchant, his cousin's writings clashing with his strongly capitalist convictions, and further whetting his appetite for retribution. Erasmus' hatred for his cousin stems from his childhood, when Matthew had forcefully lifted him away when he was trying to dam a river. With his party of fifty, he finds the settlement. Some are shot, the rest being taken to St. Augustine by ship. He intends to sell the slaves as his father's property, and have the crew hanged for murdering Thurso. He particularly looks forward to the hanging of his cousin Paris, whose leg wound appears minor. But the trauma of the gunshot has triggered \\"some occlusion of the blood,\\" a pulmonary embolism that Paris recognises as fatal. Paris dies before the ship can reach St. Augustine, and Erasmus comes to the realisation that Paris did not lift him clear of the dam to cheat him of victory, but to save him from defeat.

However, once in parliament he dropped this allegiance, supporting the administrations of John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute and Pitt the elder. He held the County Durham seat for two parliaments until he declined to stand in the election of 1768. On 18 April 1774 Shafto married Anne Duncombe (died 1783), daughter and heir of Thomas Duncombe of Duncombe Park, Yorkshire, by his marriage to Diana Howard, a daughter of Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle.

The basic idea is the same as for a deterministic dynamical system, but requires careful treatment because random dynamical systems are necessarily non- autonomous. This requires one to consider the notion of a pullback attractor or attractor in the pullback sense. Set-up and motivation Consider a random dynamical system \\\\varphi on a complete separable metric space (X, d), where the noise is chosen from a probability space (\\\\Omega, \\\\mathcal{F}, \\\\mathbb{P}) with base flow \\\\vartheta : \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\times \\\\Omega \\\\to \\\\Omega. A na√Øve definition of an attractor \\\\mathcal{A} for this random dynamical system would be to require that for any initial condition x_{0} \\\\in X, \\\\varphi(t, \\\\omega) x_{0} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{A} as t \\\\to + \\\\infty. This definition is far too limited, especially in dimensions higher than one. A more plausible definition, modelled on the idea of an omega-limit set, would be to say that a point a \\\\in X lies in the attractor \\\\mathcal{A} if and only if there exists an initial condition, x_{0} \\\\in X, and there is a sequence of times t_{n} \\\\to + \\\\infty such that :d \\\\left( \\\\varphi(t_{n}, \\\\omega) x_{0}, a \\\\right) \\\\to 0 as n \\\\to \\\\infty. This is not too far from a working definition. However, we have not yet considered the effect of the noise \\\\omega, which makes the system non- autonomous (i.e. it depends explicitly on time). For technical reasons, it becomes necessary to do the following: instead of looking t seconds into the \\"future\\", and considering the limit as t \\\\to + \\\\infty, one \\"rewinds\\" the noise t seconds into the \\"past\\", and evolves the system through t seconds using the same initial condition. That is, one is interested in the pullback limit :\\\\lim_{t \\\\to + \\\\infty} \\\\varphi (t, \\\\vartheta_{-t} \\\\omega). So, for example, in the pullback sense, the omega-limit set for a (possibly random) set B(\\\\omega) \\\\subseteq X is the random set :\\\\Omega_{B} (\\\\omega) := \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in X \\\\left\\\\exists t_{n} \\\\to + \\\\infty, \\\\exists b_{n} \\\\in B(\\\\vartheta_{-t_{n}} \\\\omega) \\\\mathrm{\\\\,s.t.\\\\,} \\\\varphi (t_{n}, \\\\vartheta_{-t_{n}} \\\\omega) b_{n} \\\\to x \\\\mathrm{\\\\,as\\\\,} n \\\\to \\\\infty \\\\right. \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Equivalently, this may be written as :\\\\Omega_{B} (\\\\omega) = \\\\bigcap_{t \\\\geq 0} \\\\overline{\\\\bigcup_{s \\\\geq t} \\\\varphi (s, \\\\vartheta_{-s} \\\\omega) B(\\\\vartheta_{-s} \\\\omega)}. Importantly, in the case of a deterministic dynamical system (one without noise), the pullback limit coincides with the deterministic forward limit, so it is meaningful to compare deterministic and random omega-limit sets, attractors, and so forth. Several examples of pullback attractors of non-autonomous dynamical systems are presented analytically and numerically. Definition The pullback attractor (or random global attractor) \\\\mathcal{A} (\\\\omega) for a random dynamical system is a \\\\mathbb{P}-almost surely unique random set such that # \\\\mathcal{A} (\\\\omega) is a random compact set: \\\\mathcal{A} (\\\\omega) \\\\subseteq X is almost surely compact and \\\\omega \\\\mapsto \\\\mathrm{dist} (x, \\\\mathcal{A} (\\\\omega)) is a (\\\\mathcal{F}, \\\\mathcal{B}(X))-measurable function for every x \\\\in X; # \\\\mathcal{A} (\\\\omega) is invariant: for all \\\\varphi (t, \\\\omega) ( \\\\mathcal{A} (\\\\omega) ) = \\\\mathcal{A} (\\\\vartheta_{t} \\\\omega) almost surely; # \\\\mathcal{A} (\\\\omega) is attractive: for any deterministic bounded set B \\\\subseteq X, ::\\\\lim_{t \\\\to + \\\\infty} \\\\mathrm{dist} \\\\left( \\\\varphi (t, \\\\vartheta_{-t} \\\\omega) (B), \\\\mathcal{A} (\\\\omega) \\\\right) = 0 almost surely. There is a slight abuse of notation in the above: the first use of \\"dist\\" refers to the Hausdorff semi-distance from a point to a set, :\\\\mathrm{dist} (x, A) := \\\\inf_{a \\\\in A} d(x, a), whereas the second use of \\"dist\\" refers to the Hausdorff semi-distance between two sets, :\\\\mathrm{dist} (B, A) := \\\\sup_{b \\\\in B} \\\\inf_{a \\\\in A} d(b, a). As noted in the previous section, in the absence of noise, this definition of attractor coincides with the deterministic definition of the attractor as the minimal compact invariant set that attracts all bounded deterministic sets. Theorems relating omega-limit sets to attractors The attractor as a union of omega-limit sets If a random dynamical system has a compact random absorbing set K, then the random global attractor is given by :\\\\mathcal{A} (\\\\omega) = \\\\overline{\\\\bigcup_{B} \\\\Omega_{B} (\\\\omega)}, where the union is taken over all bounded sets B \\\\subseteq X. Bounding the attractor within a deterministic set Crauel (1999) proved that if the base flow \\\\vartheta is ergodic and D \\\\subseteq X is a deterministic compact set with :\\\\mathbb{P} \\\\left( \\\\mathcal{A} (\\\\cdot) \\\\subseteq D \\\\right) > 0, then \\\\mathcal{A} (\\\\omega) = \\\\Omega_{D} (\\\\omega) \\\\mathbb{P}-almost surely.

So the 1-fold and 2-fold Pfister forms look like: :\\\\langle\\\\\\\\!\\\\langle a\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\!\\\\rangle\\\\cong \\\\langle 1, -a \\\\rangle = x^2 - ay^2. :\\\\langle\\\\\\\\!\\\\langle a,b\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\!\\\\rangle\\\\cong \\\\langle 1, -a, -b, ab \\\\rangle = x^2 - ay^2 - bz^2 + abw^2. For n ‚â§ 3, the n-fold Pfister forms are norm forms of composition algebras.Lam (2005) p. 316 In that case, two n-fold Pfister forms are isomorphic if and only if the corresponding composition algebras are isomorphic. In particular, this gives the classification of octonion algebras. The n-fold Pfister forms additively generate the n-th power In of the fundamental ideal of the Witt ring of F.Lam (2005) p. 316 Characterizations A quadratic form q over a field F is multiplicative if, for vectors of indeterminates x and y, we can write q(x).q(y) = q(z) for some vector z of rational functions in the x and y over F. Isotropic quadratic forms are multiplicative.Lam (2005) p. 324 For anisotropic quadratic forms, Pfister forms are multiplicative, and conversely.Lam (2005) p. 325 For n-fold Pfister forms with n ‚â§ 3, this had been known since the 19th century; in that case z can be taken to be bilinear in x and y, by the properties of composition algebras. It was a remarkable discovery by Pfister that n-fold Pfister forms for all n are multiplicative in the more general sense here, involving rational functions. For example, he deduced that for any field F and any natural number n, the set of sums of 2n squares in F is closed under multiplication, using that the quadratic form x_1^2 +\\\\cdots + x_{2^n}^2 is an n-fold Pfister form (namely, \\\\langle\\\\\\\\!\\\\langle -1, \\\\ldots , -1 \\\\rangle\\\\\\\\!\\\\rangle).Lam (2005) p. 319 Another striking feature of Pfister forms is that every isotropic Pfister form is in fact hyperbolic, that is, isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of the hyperbolic plane \\\\langle 1, -1 \\\\rangle. This property also characterizes Pfister forms, as follows. If q is an anisotropic quadratic form over a field F, and if q becomes hyperbolic over every extension field E such that q becomes isotropic over E, then q is isomorphic to aœÜ for some nonzero a in F and some Pfister form œÜ over F.Elman, Karpenko, Merkurjev (2008), Corollary 23.4. Connection with K-theory Let kn(F) be the n-th Milnor K-group modulo 2. There is a homomorphism from kn(F) to the quotient In/In+1 in the Witt ring of F, given by : \\\\\\\\{a_1,\\\\ldots,a_n\\\\\\\\} \\\\mapsto \\\\langle\\\\\\\\!\\\\langle a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots , a_n \\\\rangle\\\\\\\\!\\\\rangle , where the image is an n-fold Pfister form.Elman, Karpenko, Merkurjev (2008), section 5. The homomorphism is surjective, since the Pfister forms additively generate In. One part of the Milnor conjecture, proved by Orlov, Vishik and Voevodsky, states that this homomorphism is in fact an isomorphism kn(F) ‚âÖ In/In+1.Orlov, Vishik, Voevodsky (2007). That gives an explicit description of the abelian group In/In+1 by generators and relations. The other part of the Milnor conjecture, proved by Voevodsky, says that kn(F) (and hence In/In+1) maps isomorphically to the Galois cohomology group Hn(F, F2). Pfister neighbors A Pfister neighbor is an anisotropic form œÉ which is isomorphic to a subform of aœÜ for some nonzero a in F and some Pfister form œÜ with dim œÜ < 2 dim œÉ.Elman, Karpenko, Merkurjev (2008), Definition 23.10. The associated Pfister form œÜ is determined up to isomorphism by œÉ. Every anisotropic form of dimension 3 is a Pfister neighbor; an anisotropic form of dimension 4 is a Pfister neighbor if and only if its discriminant in F*/(F*)2 is trivial.Lam (2005) p. 341 A field F has the property that every 5-dimensional anisotropic form over F is a Pfister neighbor if and only if it is a linked field.Lam (2005) p. 342 Notes References  , Ch. 10 * Category:Quadratic forms ","title":"Pfister form"},{"id":"7204604","text":"Regional parks of New Zealand are administered by regional councils, the top tier of local government in New Zealand.

Originally composed of Dhani Harrison and Oliver Hecks, with Harrison playing lead guitar and singing lead vocals, and Hecks playing drums and synthesizer. As of 2014, the band consisted of Harrison, Jonathan Sadoff, Jeremy Faccone, Paul Hicks, Aaron Older and Frank Zummo. The name \\"Thenewno2\\" is a reference to the 1960s British television show The Prisoner. Thenewno2 have been credited with the album design for George Harrison's Brainwashed and Dark Horse Years box set, and for Concert for George, and the menu design for the 2005 Concert for Bangladesh DVD. Hecks was the still photographer for the Concert for George in 2002, and some of his photographs appear in Genesis Publications' limited-edition book from the same event. Thenewno2 released their debut album, You Are Here, in February 2009. Late Night with Conan O'Brien chose thenewno2 to be one of the show's final musical guests, a spot that also marked the band's TV debut in the US. Later that spring, thenewno2 played Coachella, where Spin magazine dubbed their performance one of the \\"best debut performances of the festival\\". After concluding a US tour, the band took a break and Harrison focused on his side project, Fistful of Mercy featuring Harrison, Ben Harper and Joseph Arthur. Their debut was released in October 2010 and was named \\"One of the Best Side Projects of 2010\\" by NPR. On 31 July 2012, thenewno2 released their second album, thefearofmissingout. Rolling Stone listed the band as one of the ten \\"Must-See Acts\\" at the 2012 Lollapalooza festival. Thenewno2 scored the music to the 2013 film Beautiful Creatures. History Formation Thenewno2 formed in London, England in 2006, but Harrison and Hicks had been collaborating since as far back as 2001. Harrison and Hicks chose the name Thenewno2 (pronounced \\"the new number two\\"), because they wanted a \\"faceless entity\\" that they could use to make music, which would give them a chance to legitimatize without the help of Dhani Harrison's famous last name (he is George Harrison's son). They took the name \\"Thenewno2\\" from the British cult classic television series The Prisoner, liking the idea of an anonymous person. As Dhani explains, \\"I wanted it to be a faceless entity, because I didn‚Äôt want to be 'Dhani Harrison and the Uncles', or whatever. There was just too much flak around the name 'Harrison' at the time. I started the band so I could send anyone to a meeting, and when they were asked who they were, they could simply say 'The New No. 2.'\\" In the media The song \\"Yomp\\" was released as a downloadable track for the music video game Rock Band on 29 July 2008, and the song \\"Crazy Tuesday\\" was released as one of 20 free songs for Rock Band 2.Rock Band 2 DLC In 2009, Dhani Harrison and Thenewno2 were featured in an issue of Guitar World magazine, discussing their concert experiences and debut album, You Are Here. On 16 February 2009 Thenewno2 performed the song \\"Yomp\\" from the album You Are Here on the American television show Late Night with Conan O'Brien in New York City. On 13 April 2009 they played at the Casbah in San Diego, California. The band played a 30-minute set at the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago, Illinois on 8 August 2009. In 2009, Thenewno2 began their first US tour, joined by The Heartless Bastards, and headlined by Wolfmother. The tour began in Dallas, Texas on 29 October running through to Los Angeles, California, on 24 November. The band agreed to do the soundtrack to the film Beautiful Creatures, and recorded it at Abbey Road Studios.

R. Subba Rao's three novels Nagarahavu, Ondu Gandu Eradu Hennu and Sarpa Mathsara, and starring Vishnuvardhan, Aarathi , K. S. Ashwath and Shubha in lead roles. The supporting cast features Leelavathi, Ambareesh, Shivaram, Dheerendra Gopal, Lokanath and Vajramuni. This is the first Kannada movie to complete 100 days in three centres. This film was remade in Hindi as Zehreela Insaan, directed by Puttanna Kanagal himself and in Tamil as Raja Nagam and Kode Nagu in Telugu. The film was a huge success and paved way for the stardom of Vishnuvardhan, Ambarish and Aarathi who eventually morphed as leading actors in Kannada cinema. This was Vishnuvardhan's first movie as the lead. Over a period of time, the character roles of Leelavathi, Dheerendra Gopal, Loknath, M. N. Lakshmi Devi have come in for their share of applause. The film primarily revolves around the protagonist's relationship with his teacher, Chamayya (K. S. Ashwath). Chamayya, who is childless treats Ramachari (Vishnuvardhan) as his son. He takes it upon himself to guide Ramachari on the right path despite Ramachari's legendary anger. He usually acts as the negotiator between his student and the people who have issues with Ramachari's behaviour. Ramachari is a young man whose anger is his weakness. He is difficult to reason with and has a great deal of pride. Chamayya is the only person who can convince him to do anything. His love interests are Alamelu (Aarathi) and Margaret (Shubha) who play pivotal parts in his life. The conversations between the Guru (Chamayya) and Shishya (Ramachari) are the highlight of the movie all through. Chamayya and Ramachari have differences of opinion over what is right and wrong. Chamayya is more willing to blend in with the society than Ramachari and this usually ends in an argument between the two. It is possible that the society is the silent rhetoric for the title of the movie which spreads venom ‚Äî a cobra. The film was re-released in its digitized version on July 20, 2018. This movie was digitalized by Balaji who is the brother of V.Ravichandran and son of Veeraswammy who was the producer. The re-release was also a big hit and broke so-many records. The re-release got a huge appreciation from all and created a new record of collection.  Plot details  The story revolves around a short-tempered, yet affable college student named Ramachari. Ramachari is unpopular in the whole town of Chitradurga as an ill-tempered boy and is disliked by many people in his college.  First few years of Ramachari in College  The story begins with Ramachari being caught in a classroom while trying to copy in an examination. The college principal (Loknath) suspends him for copying in the exam. Ramachari is humiliated and angry at this action and later at night Ramachari throws stones at the principal's house and when the principal wakes up and comes out of his house, Ramachari ties the half-naked principal to a pole and runs away satisfied. Then the plot focuses on Ramachari's home. Ramachari is brought up in a pious and religious Brahmin environment by his parents Madhwacharya and Sonabai. His father doesn't like him because he is unpopular in the whole town as a ruffian. His mother is worried about his future. One person who truly (seems to) understand Ramachari is his primary school teacher, Chamayya (K.S.Ashwath) master. Ramachari finds the company of his primary school teacher Chamayya and his wife Tunga (Leelavathi), more interesting than that of his parents and considers them as his parents. Ramachari has very great regards for his Chamayya master even though he is no longer his academic teacher and would do whatever his teacher would say without thinking. The next part of the story is about the two women Almelu (Aarathi) and Margaret (Shubha) who come into Ramachari's life and how the teacher Chamayya influences Ramachari's decisions in these relationships. The teacher tries to bring Ramachari in the \\"conventional way of life\\", but he errs and Ramachari's life is destroyed.  Almelu  In college, Ramachari hangs out with Varada (Shivaram) and other friends. Varada has a very beautiful sister named Almelu. Almelu's beauty has maddened a neighbourhood hooligan, Jaleela (Ambareesh) who keeps stalking her. Varada wants to put an end to this eve-teasing but he is a timid, pusillanimous person. He asks Ramachari for help. Ramachari agrees based on the condition that he should marry Almelu. Ramachari is tempted and he fixes Jaleela and drives him away out of Almelu's life. Almelu and Ramachari fall in love. At this point, when Almelu and Ramachari are truly in love, Almelu's marriage is fixed with a boy of her caste. When Almelu tries to refuse the proposal by saying she is in love with Ramachari and asks for Varada's support, Varada says that he never gave Ramachari any promise and deceives Ramachari. At this point, the teacher Chamayya intervenes in Ramachari's life and says to give up hope on Almelu. He convinces Ramachari by making him understand that sacrifice is a greater act than selfish love. Ramachari, confused, agrees to his teacher and sacrifices his love. Years later, Ramachari meets her in a five-star hotel as a prostitute. Almelu's husband sold her into flesh trade and she had turned into a prostitute.  Margaret  The second lady in Ramachari's life is Margaret, a peppy Christian girl who has moved into the town who has young men like Tukaram (Dheerendra Gopal) swaying to her tunes. Ramachari kisses Margaret on an ego tussle between the two and they soon fall in love. However, due to the intense pressure in the society which denounces the marriage between a Brahmin boy and a Christian girl, they decide to run away. Once again the teacher Chamayya tries to stop Ramachari and says that by sacrificing his love for Margaret, he will be holding his religion and tradition before love. But this time, Ramachari confronts his teacher and says that he won't budge because the last time he sacrificed his love for Almelu, it went horribly wrong and Almelu was a high society prostitute. Chamayya master, accused now of ruining Almelu's life, realizes (perhaps for the first time) that Ramachari was right and he was wrong.  Climax  The movie ends with Chamayya master falling to his death from the hill when Ramachari pushes him in a fit of rage after his master tells him, \\"if you want to marry her, you have to witness my death before it.\\" He will not have any motive to kill his master, but it shows his respect for his master since he doesn't want to hear about his master's death. Ramachari, shocked by this incident asks Margaret to join him in a bid to accompany his beloved teacher in death, to which she happily agrees. They both commit suicide by jumping off a cliff. Ramachari, the hero is compared to a King Cobra. Dangerous, yet respected but a misfit in the society. Other Key Characters Chamayya Meshtru Chamayya Meshtru (K. S. Ashwath) is the ever-supportive guardian of Ramachari who treats him as his own son. He is supposed be the only person able to control and have an influence over Ramachari. However, his desire to see Ramachari tread the traditional path leads to conflicts with Ramachari and ultimately his own death as well as Ramachari's. The movie focuses on a beautiful relationship with the teacher and student. In one emotional scene, Chamayya Meshtru accuses Ramachari of raping Almelu and then hits him with his walking stick, only to find out from Ramachari that it was a false allegation. The scene concludes with Ramachari tearfully saying, \\"Betha murdhogide, repairy madi tandkodteeni\\" and Chamayya Meshtru helplessly regretting his haste is a classic scene. Jaleela Jaleela (Ambarish) is the rowdy young man who teases Almelu every time she goes to college. He teases her by singing the then-popular hit \\" Mere sapnon ki Rani kab Ayegi tu\\". Almelu is fed up with this daily harassment and complains to her brother Varda. Varda tries to confront Jaleela, but soon gets bullied over by Jaleela and retreats in haste. He then turns towards Ramachari asking him to help his sister. In a pivotal scene, Ramachari questions Varda as to why he should help his sister to which Varda promises to have Ramachari and Almelu married if Ramachari helps get rid of Jaleela the nuisance. This spurs on Ramachari who takes on Jaleela in a thrilling fight scene with Jaleela. The stakes of the fight is raised by the pailwan of the town who promises the winner a garland. After an intense fight, Ramachari wins and is rewarded with the promised garland. Jaleela asks for forgiveness and limps away even as Varda extracts his own little revenge. Varda Varda (Shivaram)is an Iyengar friend of the Madhwa Ramachari. He is usually known to be trying to find a speciality in someone and often uses that word in his dialogues. He is a key character who promises Almelu's hand in marriage to Ramachari, only to flip when he finds out that Ramachari is serious. He accuses Ramachari of raping Almelu. Ultimately, this results in Chamayya Meshtru having to intervene and have Almelu marry a husband of the choice of her parents. Thungamma Thungamma (Leelavathi) is the wife of Chamayya meshtru. She is the ever doting foster mom of Ramachari. Ramachari adores her very much. Their affection is well depicted when Ramachari enters Thungamma's house after having committed yet another act of defiance. This time he would have tied his college principal to a pole. This is noticed by Thungamma and Chamayya meshtru puts the principal out of his misery and eventually has Ramachari apologizing to the principal. After this, Ramachari comes over to Thugamma's house where he is greeted by an angry Thumgamma. Eventually Ramachari also pretends to get angry and is pampered by Thungamma depicting their mother-son equation.  Cast  * Vishnuvardhan as Ramachari *Aarathi as Alamelu *Shubha as Margaret *K. S.

R. Subba Rao remarked that Puttanna Kanagal has turned Naagarahaavu (the cobra) into 'Kerehaavu' (meaning rat snake). The implied meaning is that the characterisation of Ramachari in the novel and the movie is strikingly different and less effective. Nevertheless, Naagarahaavu is an all-time favorite movie and remains popular in all its reruns.  Remakes  * This film was remade in Hindi titled as Zehreela Insaan, directed by Puttanna Kanagal himself. * The film was remade in Tamil as Raja Nagam with Srikanth playing the lead role. * This film was remade into Telugu titled Kode Nagu starring Sobhan Babu, Chandrakala and Lakshmi and noted lyricist Acharya Athreya. This was directed by K. S. Prakash Rao.  Trivia  * Baare Baare song was fully shot in slow-motion, two decades before Mansoor Khan would shoot \\"Pehlaa Nashaa\\" in Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar. * T. R.

He was notable for his restoration of historic buildings in Ocotl√°n de Morelos and, together with Rufino Tamayo and Francisco Toledo, helped make Oaxaca in Southern Mexico a centre for contemporary art and tourism. Up until his death in 2001, both he and Toledo had been regarded as Mexico‚Äôs greatest living artists for over a decade. Early years A Zapotec Native American, born to working class parents in the small town of Ocotl√°n de Morelos, Morales was an often solitary child who found comfort in drawing. From 1948 to 1953 he studied art at the Academy of San Carlos in Mexico City. He graduated as a drawing teacher and began a 32-year career as an art teacher at Escuela Nacional Preparatoria, a position he held from 1953 until 1985. In 1965 while organizing a Christmas party at the home of a sculptor friend, Geles Cabrera, he used collages as decorations. She liked his works and suggested a trade: a piece of sculpture for a painting. This recognition stimulated Morales to focus all his efforts on painting and, to make extra money, he organized exhibitions of his work in small galleries around the capital. In 1975 with Morales approaching 50, he was persuaded by Cabrera to hold his first mainstream solo exhibition at the Casa de las Campanas Art Gallery in Cuernavaca. Here his paintings came to the attention of famous Mexican painter Rufino Tamayo. Tamayo helped Morales make contacts with art critics and galleries around the world, leading to a number of joint and solo exhibitions. Later years Shrine to Morales in the monastery/museum of Ocotl√°n de Morelos, Oaxaca By 1985, Morales had earned enough money to stop teaching and to return to Oaxaca where he was able to dedicate himself to both his art and to restoration. Using income from his art he founded the Rodolfo Morales Cultural Foundation devoted to restoration of buildings in his hometown of Ocotl√°n. In all, he funded the restoration of fifteen churches including the 16th century Convent of Santo Domingo and a 17th-century church in the town of Santa Ana Zegache, as well creating cultural spaces throughout Oaxaca's central valleys. His most important restoration project was the former convent of Ocotlan which was converted into a municipal complex. Morales ensured that much of the restoration work done was by local women who, by developing skills, were able to later find employment elsewhere. His other notable Foundation work included setting up a computer room for local youths to learn information technology skills, providing materials to aspiring artists, producing of prints to help Frente Com√∫n Contra SIDA educate against the spread of AIDS and planting new copal trees not only to enhance the landscape but also to provide wood for the creation of hand-painted animals. Whilst continuing with his art, he would begin each day by making a small collage which he would sell to raise money for his Foundation. He died on January 30, 2001, at the age of 75 in Oaxaca from pancreatic cancer. His remains were placed in his restored Convent of Santo Domingo, in Ocotl√°n, Oaxaca. Artistic style and technique Morales‚Äô work has been described as dream-like, fertile and heavily based in folklore. It often depicts indigenous people, especially women set amongst rural buildings, churches, town squares and arcaded shops. His style is influenced by Mar√≠a Izquierdo (1902-1955) and French painter Marc Chagall (1887-1985). Women and memories appear to be at the heart of his work. Morales once explained, ‚ÄúMexico would be lost without the steadfast work of women. They bear the burden of day-to-day living and find solutions to those problems to which men simply resign themselves.‚Äù In a 1995 interview Morales explained, \\"I came here to live in my memories. . . Nostalgia and melancholy are very important to me.\\" Despite this, Morales avoided discussing the ‚Äúmeaning‚Äù of his work, often producing works without title. Characteristics of his work include rich use of colour, exaggerated hands and feet, over-sized faces, women (often brides), puppies, flowers, angels, bicycles, musical instruments and the dreamy floating of figures. Whilst the bulk of his work was oil on canvas he also produced a number of murals, highly decorated pieces of wooden furniture and characteristic cardboard pillars which, when arranged together, create a changing kaleidoscope of image and colour as the viewer walks around them. Added to this were his many collages, some sold as fund raisers but others, often in a set and in greater detail, arranged to tell a story. In 1998 the Children‚Äôs Book Press published Angel‚Äôs Kite illustrated by Morales in the form of collage.

Definition In the definition of a random dynamical system, one is given a family of maps \\\\vartheta_{s} : \\\\Omega \\\\to \\\\Omega on a probability space (\\\\Omega, \\\\mathcal{F}, \\\\mathbb{P}). The measure-preserving dynamical system (\\\\Omega, \\\\mathcal{F}, \\\\mathbb{P}, \\\\vartheta) is known as the base flow of the random dynamical system. The maps \\\\vartheta_{s} are often known as shift maps since they \\"shift\\" time. The base flow is often ergodic. The parameter s may be chosen to run over * \\\\mathbb{R} (a two-sided continuous-time dynamical system); * [0, + \\\\infty) \\\\subsetneq \\\\mathbb{R} (a one-sided continuous-time dynamical system); * \\\\mathbb{Z} (a two-sided discrete-time dynamical system); * \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{ 0 \\\\\\\\} (a one- sided discrete-time dynamical system).

It was her seventh novel.Sheila Hodges (2002) Editing Daphne du Maurier, Women's History Review, 11:2, 294, http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09612020200200322, retrieved 1-17-15 There have been 33 editions of the book printed.. Retrieved 2008-04-10. This family saga is based on the history of the Irish ancestors of Daphne du Maurier‚Äôs friend Christopher Puxley. The family resembles the Puxleys who owned mines in Allihies, a parish in County Cork. The story spans the century from 1820 to 1920 following five male characters from a family of Anglo-Irish landowners, the Brodricks, who live in a castle called Clonmere. It is divided into five sub-books and an epilogue. Each section covers part of the life of an heir. The sections include: Book One: Copper John, 1820 - 1828; Book Two: Greyhound John, 1828 - 1837; Book Three: \\"Wild Johnnie,\\" 1837 - 1858; Book Four: Henry, 1858 - 1874; Book Five: Hal, 1874 - 1895; Epilogue: The Inheritance, 1920; The title sometimes is thought to refer to Hungry Hill which is the highest peak in the Caha Mountains in County Cork, and du Maurier's description of the Hungry Hill is similar to the physical aspects of that place. Rather than simply referring to the hill, however, the title alludes to the curse put on the family by Morty Donovan, arch enemy of patriarch Copper John Brodrick, at the start of the novel, and the fact that the mines seem to \\"swallow up\\" the lives of the Brodrick family through five generations, by early death, dissipation and unhappiness. Many of the place names in the novel are imaginary, and the location is never directly stated to be Ireland, although it can be inferred from several references to \\"crossing the water\\" to reach to London, Hal's embarkation from Liverpool en route to Canada, and, in the Epilogue, the Irish War of Independence (1919-1921). The story was made into a film in 1947 directed by Brian Desmond Hurst. Retrieved 2008-04-10.

They were signed to Island Records and were highly rated by critics, especially for Chris Spedding's tasteful guitar work.\\"Crawdaddy Lead Review\\", Bruce Malamut Vol. 27, 1973Gavin Martin, \\"Sharks - Killers Of The Deep\\", Daily Mirror, 10 February 2017 The initial line-up consisted of Fraser (bass, piano), Snips (real name, Steve Parsons) (vocals), Spedding (guitar) and a Canadian, Marty Simon (drums). Formation Andy Fraser had originally contacted Chris Spedding, in July 1971, to discuss playing in his first post-Free band, Toby. When Fraser formed Sharks a year later, he contacted Spedding again and, this time, they agreed to work together. Fraser had already recruited his friend, Marty Simon, so auditions were held for a singer, to complete the line-up. Robert Palmer and Leo Sayer were turned down in favour of an unknown 21-year-old from Yorkshire, Steve Parsons, also known as Snips, originally spotted by Island A&R; man, Muff Winwood. Snips had previously fronted a Hull-based band called Nothingeverhappens. Parsons \\"played one song of his, \\"Snakes and Swallowtails\\" and he was in\\", Spedding later told Melody Maker. 1970s Sharks' first gig was in October 1972, in Islington and they played a few clubs in Europe during December 1972, before returning to London, to record their debut album. In January & February 1973, Sharks embarked on a UK tour, playing clubs and universities. To promote the band, whilst touring, Chris Spedding customized his Pontiac Le Mans, fitting a shark fin on the roof and fibreglass teeth on the grill. On 19 February 1973, on the way back to London from a gig in Cleethorpes, the car skidded and hit a tree. Fraser suffered injuries to his wrist and, during recuperation, had second thoughts about the band. After a short break, the band went back on the road in March and April, opening for Roxy Music, although Fraser had some difficulty playing with his injury. On 17 March, they made an appearance on the BBC Two programme, Old Grey Whistle Test. The tour ended on 15 April, in Cardiff. Sharks' debut album, First Water, was released in the same month, to critical acclaim, but Fraser left shortly afterwards and the band began searching for a replacement. Those considered included Tom Robinson, Ric Grech and Boz Burrell. Mick Jagger then recommended a bass player from Memphis, Tennessee, Busta Cherry Jones, who joined in July 1973, along with the ex-Audience keyboard player, Nick Judd. A new UK tour with this line-up began in September 1973 and ran through until March 1974, when their second album, Jab It in Yore Eye, was released. The band then toured the United States during April and May 1974, travelling in the same bus used by The Beatles on their first American tour, in 1964. The first two albums of the band were described as a mixture of woozy blues and hard rock.David Quantic, ‚Äò‚ÄôKillers Of The Deep - Vets‚Äô return shows they‚Äôve still got the bite‚Äô‚Äô, Classic Rock (magazine) On their return to the UK, they began recording their third album (produced by John Entwistle of The Who), with the working title Music Breakout, in June 1974. However, Simon was unhappy with the recording and was replaced by Stuart Francis. Jones then decided to return to the States, selling one of Spedding's guitars, which he stole, to pay for the flight. With Island Records not keen on the original master recordings for the third album, financial support was withdrawn and the band folded in October 1974. The album had an unofficial release in 2016, under the title Car Crash Tapes. Spedding continued his session work and solo career, whilst Snips joined Ginger Baker in the Baker Gurvitz Army and then went solo himself, before beginning a successful career as a film and TV composer. 1990s In 1993, Spedding and Snips began recording together again as Sharks, although the album, Like a Black Van Parked on a Dark Curve..., was not released until 1995. There was a one-off gig in London, in December 1995, featuring Snips, Spedding, Jackie Badger (bass), Blair Cunningham (drums) and Nick Judd (keyboards). 2010s In 2011, Chris Spedding and Steve Parsons re- united for a new project, King Mob, featuring Martin Chambers (ex-The Pretenders) on drums, Glen Matlock (ex-Sex Pistols) on bass and a new guitarist, named 'Sixteen'. Their debut album, Force 9, was released on the Steamhammer label, in November 2011. During 2013, Andy Fraser contacted Chris Spedding and the two performed UK gigs together for the first time in 40 years, backed by Fraser's band, Tobi. Fraser joined Spedding on his 2014 album Joyland, which was produced and co-written by Steve Parsons. The three musicians thought of reviving the band Sharks, however Fraser died soon after, in March 2015.Kieron Tyler, Sharks - Killers Of The Deep, Mojo (magazine) Spedding and Parsons went ahead with the reformation, including Nick Judd from the previous incarnations of the band and adding the drummer Paul Cook (ex-Sex Pistols) and the bassist Tosh Ogawa. In 2016, the band played at The Borderline in London, including new songs from the album they were preparing, and have continued playing live shows in the UK and Japan. Their 2017 show at the Lexington was described by √úber R√∂ck as 'one of the best club gigs I have seen last year and this'. Sharks released the single \\"One Last Thrill\\" on 30 September 2016 and, in January 2017, the album Killers of the Deep (cover art by comic book artist Shaky Kane), both through 3Ms Records. Unlike the albums from the 1970s, which were produced by a record company, this time the musicians recorded the album on their own and had more control on their work. They made the recordings as live as possible, none of the tracks having more than four takes. The album was well received, being mentioned the steady groove and the good song-writing quality,\\"Sharks - Cult 70s Band Bares Its' Teeth\\", Guitarist (magazine), March 2017 deserving to deliver the success that eluded Sharks first time round. The rock is more melodic, with the guitarist Spedding alternating between swamp-blues (\\"Killer On The New Tube\\") and sharp rockabilly (\\"Can‚Äôt Get The Devil\\"). Sharks themselves have been filming their 21st century revival for a documentary feature to be entitled One Last Thrill. In June 2017, they released a six minute promo clip of the film through the Vive Le Rock website.

He was later a federal Liberal politician and businessman. Born Herbert Harry Handby in Adelaide, South Australia, Handby was invariably referred to simply as 'Jim'. Handby enjoyed a league football career at two SANFL clubs, achieving his greatest honours while featuring prominently in the development of the young Glenelg club. Handby commenced his career with South Adelaide in 1922. Although not a classically brilliant player, he displayed great perseverance and all round effectiveness. He was quickly recognised as one of the best defenders in South Australia, and in 1923 Handby made his debut at state-level football. Altogether he represented South Australia 29 times during his career. Handby joined Glenelg in 1925, and on debut featured prominently in the club's first ever win (breaking a 56-game losing streak).http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/glenelg_(2).htm Handby won Glenelg's club champion award in 1925 and 1929. He won the SANFL's Magarey Medal in 1928 as the fairest and most brilliant player in the competition. He was Glenelg's captain-coach in 1926 and 1927 but then relinquished this role until 1930, when he started a further three-year period as captain-coach. The best result he achieved as a coach was 6th (in an 8 team competition) in 1931. After leaving football he became a publican and company director before being elected to Glenelg Council, and he served in the military from 1942 to 1945. In 1949, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the Liberal member for the new seat of Kingston, defeating Labor member for Boothby Thomas Sheehy for the notionally Labor seat. He was defeated in 1951 by Labor's Pat Galvin and returned to his business career. He died in 1991.

() Early life Born Minoru \\"Sakyo\\" Komatsu in Osaka, he was a graduate of Kyoto University where he studied Italian literature. After graduating, he worked at various jobs, including as a magazine reporter and a writer for stand-up comedy acts.\\"Sci-fi pioneer Komatsu dies at age 80\\", The Japan Times, July 29, 2011 Career Komatsu's writing career began in the 1960s. Reading K≈çb≈ç Abe and Italian classics made Komatsu feel modern literature and science fiction are the same. In 1961, he submitted for the 1st Scientific-fiction Contest of Hayakawa's SF Magazine: \\"Peace on Earth\\" was a short story in which World War II does not end in 1945 and a young man prepares to defend Japan against the Allied invasion. Komatsu received an honourable mention and 5000 yen.The New York Times obituary, \\"Sci-fi writer got the continental drift\\" August 22, 2011 via Sydney Morning Herald He won the same contest the following year with the story, \\"Memoirs of an Eccentric Time Traveller\\". His first novel, The Japanese Apache, was published two years later and sold 50,000 copies. In the West he is best known for the novels Japan Sinks (1973) and Sayonara Jupiter (1982). Both were adapted to film, Tidal Wave (1973) and Bye Bye Jupiter (1984). The story \\"The Savage Mouth\\" was translated by Judith Merril and has been anthologized. At the time of publication, his apocalyptic vision of a sunk Japan wiped out by shifts incurred through geographic stress worried a Japan still haunted by the atomic devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He was inspired to write it thinking of what would happen if the nationalistic Japanese lost their land, and ironically prefigured the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami that triggered a nuclear plant disaster decades later on March 11, 2011 ‚Äì the result of which he was interested in \\"to see how Japan would evolve\\" after the catastrophe. Komatsu was involved in organizing the Japan World Exposition in Osaka Prefecture in 1970. In 1984, Komatsu served as a technical consultant for a live concert in Linz, Austria by Japanese electronic composer Isao Tomita. He won the 1985 Nihon SF Taisho Award. Komatsu was one of two Author Guests of Honor at Nippon 2007, the 65th World Science Fiction Convention in 2007 in Yokohama, Japan. This was the first Worldcon to be held in Asia. With Shin'ichi Hoshi and Yasutaka Tsutsui, Komatsu was considered one of the masters of Japanese science fiction. Death Komatsu died on July 26, 2011 in Osaka from complications with pneumonia at the age of 80.https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/11/arts/sakyo- komatsu-science-fiction-writer-dies-at-80.html?_r=0 Five days before his death, his quarterly publication, Sakyo Komatsu Magazine, released an issue featuring an article on his thoughts about the 2011 tsunami. In the article, Komtasu expressed hope that his country would evolve after the catastrophe. \\"I had thought I wouldn't mind dying any day ... but now I'm feeling like living a little bit longer and seeing how Japan will go on hereafter,\\" he wrote.

Its role is to work in partnership with police and other law enforcement agencies to protect vulnerable and exploited workers. History The Gangmasters Licensing Authority (GLA) was established on 1 April 2005 by the Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004, passed in the aftermath of the 2004 Morecambe Bay cockling disaster. The authority was handed a remit of preventing the exploitation of workers in the fresh produce sector - agriculture, horticulture, shellfish gathering, and all associated processing and packaging. Initially, the authority sat under the control of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) but on 9 April 2014 it was switched to the control of the Home Office. In making the announcement, Prime Minister David Cameron stated that the move would ‚Äòstrengthen its enforcement and intelligence capabilities‚Äô by putting it directly alongside the considerable resources of the National Crime Agency.https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tougher-enforcement-action-and- stronger-penalties-for-unscrupulous-employers On 30 April 2017, the GLA was rebranded as the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA) as part of reforms under the Immigration Act 2016.https://www.gla.gov.uk/whats-new/press- release-archive/170616-transition-to-the-glaa/ The government invested an additional ¬£2 million to extend the authority's remit, allowing it to prevent, detect, and investigate worker exploitation across the entire economy. Specialist Labour Abuse Prevention Officers (LAPOs) were given powers under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to investigate labour market offences, including the forced or compulsory labour element of modern slavery, across England and Wales. A new Joint Slavery and Trafficking Analysis Centre opened in April 2017. The dedicated unit - made up of analysts from the National Crime Agency, police, Border Force, Immigration Enforcement, HM Revenue and Customs, and the GLAA - mirrors a joint working model successfully used to gather intelligence on terrorism. The Immigration Act 2016 also created the position of the Director of Labour Market Enforcementhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/sir-david-metcalf-named-as-the- first-director-of-labour-market-enforcement which provides strategic direction for organisations regulating the UK labour market: * GLAA * HM Revenue and Customs' National Minimum Wage unit * Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate In July 2019, the government opened a public consultation on plans to establish a new single labour market enforcement body.https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/good-work-plan-establishing- a-new-single-enforcement-body-for-employment-rights This would combine the GLAA, HM Revenue and Customs' National Minimum Wage unit, and the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate into one agency tackling labour exploitation and enforcing workers' rights. Enforcement The GLAA investigates circumstances where there is a risk of worker exploitation by gathering intelligence and working with police, government departments, and other enforcement agencies to target, dismantle and disrupt serious and organised crime across the UK labour market. The Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004 established four specific offences: * Operating as a gangmaster without a licence * Obtaining or possessing a false licence or false documentation likely to cause another person to believe that a person acting as a gangmaster is licensed * Entering into arrangements/using an unlicensed gangmaster * Obstructing enforcement officers/compliance officers exercising their functions under the Act In England and Wales, the GLAA uses the Modern Slavery Act 2015 to investigate forced or compulsory labour and human trafficking offences. The Immigration Act 2016 also introduced Labour Market Enforcement Undertakings (LMEUs) and Labour Market Enforcement Orders (LMEOs) which can be used as an alternative or additional sanction for breaches of labour market legislation.https://www.gla.gov.uk/media/2832/gla-brief-50-labour-market- enforcement-undertakings-and-orders-final.pdf The first LMEO in the UK was issued following a GLAA investigation into a couple from Leicester who illegally supplied workers to food factories in the city.https://www.gla.gov.uk/whats-new/press-release-archive/25102018-couple- convicted-of-labour-exploitation/ Regulation The GLAA operates a licensing scheme regulating businesses who provide workers to the fresh produce supply chain, to make sure they meet the employment standards required by law. Labour providers are assessed by GLAA compliance officers to check they are meeting the authority's licensing standards which cover health and safety, accommodation, pay, transport and training.https://www.gla.gov.uk/i-am-a/i-supply-workers/do-i-need-a-glaa- licence/licensing-standards/ Employment agencies, labour providers and gangmasters who supply workers to the sectors listed below need a GLAA licence: * Agriculture * Horticulture * Shellfish gathering * Any associated processing and packaging It is a criminal offence to supply workers without a licence or use an unlicensed labour provider. The maximum penalty for acting as an unlicensed gangmaster is 10 years in prison and an unlimited fine.http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/11/section/12 Prevention The GLAA has a key role in working with businesses to prevent exploitation from happening in the first place. In October 2017, the authority launched the Construction Protocolhttps://www.gla.gov.uk/i-am-a/i-use-workers/construction- protocol/, which is aimed at eradicating slavery and labour exploitation in the building industry. The protocol commits signatories to: * Work in partnership with the GLAA to protect vulnerable workers * Share information, where possible, to help stop or prevent the exploitation of workers * Work together to manage information sensitively and confidentially * Raise awareness within supply chains * Maintain momentum by communicating regularly This protocol was followed by the creation of the Apparel and General Merchandise Public Private Protocolhttps://www.gla.gov.uk/i-am-a/i-use- workers/apparel-and-general-merchandise-public-private-protocol/ in November 2018, which has the same principles as the Construction Protocol but with a focus on the textiles industry. The GLAA has also worked with the Downstream Fuel Association and other partners to set up the Responsible Car Wash Scheme,https://rcws.org.uk a project to tackle exploitation and non-compliance at hand car washes. It is supported by Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, ASDA, and Waitrose, all of whom joined the scheme to ensure that operators on their sites were abiding by the regulations. Governance The GLAA is a Non- Departmental Public Body governed by an independent Board and Chair appointed by the Home Secretary. It currently has eight members and is responsible for ensuring the GLAA fulfils its role of working in partnership to protect vulnerable and exploited workers.https://www.gla.gov.uk/who-we-are/the-glaa- board/ The agency also sits alongside HM Revenue and Customs' National Minimum Wage unit and the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate within the scope of the Director of Labour Market Enforcement (DLME), which sets the priorities for the organisations tackling labour market offences.

It can, amongst other things, be used in analysing sediments and compost. A useful application for C/N ratios is as a proxy for paleoclimate research, having different uses whether the sediment cores are terrestrial-based or marine-based. Carbon-to-nitrogen ratios are an indicator for nitrogen limitation of plants and other organisms and can identify whether molecules found in the sediment under study come from land-based or algal plants. Further, they can distinguish between different land-based plants, depending on the type of photosynthesis they undergo. Therefore, the C/N ratio serves as a tool for understanding the sources of sedimentary organic matter, which can lead to information about the ecology, climate, and ocean circulation at different times in Earth‚Äôs history. C/N ratios in the range 4-10:1 are usually from marine sources, whereas higher ratios are likely to come from a terrestrial source.Gray KR, Biddlestone AJ. 1973. Composting - process parameters. The Chemical Engineer. Feb. pp 71-76Stewart, Keith (2006). It's A Long Road to A Tomato. New York: Marlowe & Company. p. 155. . Vascular plants from terrestrial sources tend to have C/N ratios greater than 20. The lack of cellulose, which has a chemical formula of (C6H10O5)n, and greater amount of proteins in algae versus vascular plants causes this significant difference in the C/N ratio.Meyers, Philip A., and Heidi Doose. \\"29.

When composting, microbial activity utilizes a C/N ratio of 30-35:1 and a higher ratio will result in slower composting rates. However, this assumes that carbon is completely consumed, which is often not the case. Thus, for practical agricultural purposes, a compost should have an initial C/N ratio of 20-30:1.Dahlem. \\"Flux to the Seafloor\\", Group Report, eds. K.W. Bruland et al., pp. 210‚Äì213, 1988. Example of devices that can be used to measure this ratio are the CHN analyzer and the continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer (CF-IRMS).Brenna, J. Thomas, et al. \\"High‚Äêprecision continuous‚Äêflow isotope ratio mass spectrometry.\\" Mass Spectrometry Reviews 16.5 (1997): 227-258. However, for more practical applications, desired C/N ratios can be achieved by blending common used substrates of known C/N content, which are readily available and easy to use.  Applications   Marine  Organic matter that is deposited in marine sediments contains a key indicator as to its source and the processes it underwent before reaching the floor as well as after deposition, its carbon to nitrogen ratio.Jasper, J.

However, it has been observed that only 10% of this organic matter (algae) produced in the surface ocean sinks to the deep ocean without being degraded by bacteria in transit, and only about 1% is permanently buried in the sediment. An important process called sediment diagenesis accounts for the other 9% of organic carbon that sank to the deep ocean floor, but was not permanently buried, that is 9% of the total organic carbon produced is degraded in the deep ocean.Emerson, S., and J. Hedges. ‚ÄúSediment Diagenesis and Benthic Flux.‚Äù Treatise on Geochemistry 6.11 (2003): 293-319. The microbial communities utilizing the sinking organic carbon as an energy source, are partial to nitrogen-rich compounds because much of these bacterium are nitrogen-limited and much prefer it over carbon. As a result, the carbon to nitrogen ratio of sinking organic carbon in the deep ocean is elevated compared to fresh surface ocean organic matter that had not been degraded. An exponential increase in C/N ratios is observed with increasing water depth‚Äîwith C/N ratios reaching 10 at intermediate water depths of about 1000 meters, and up to 15 in the deep ocean (~ >2500 meters) . This elevated C/N signature is preserved in the sediment, until another form of diagenesis, post-depositional diagenesis, alters its C/N signature once again. Post- depositional diagenesis occurs in organic-carbon-poor marine sediments where bacteria are able to oxidize organic matter in aerobic conditions as an energy source. The oxidation reaction proceeds as follows: CH2O + H2O ‚Üí CO2 \\\\+ 4H+ \\\\+ 4e‚àí, with a standard free energy of ‚Äì27.4 kJ mol‚àí1 (half reaction). Once all of the oxygen is used up, bacteria are able to carry out an anoxic sequence of chemical reactions as an energy source, all with negative ‚àÜG¬∞r values, with the reaction becoming less favorable as the chain of reactions proceeds. The same principle described above explaining the preferential degradation of nitrogen-rich organic matter occurs within the sediments, as they are more labile and are in higher demand. This principle has been utilized in paleoceanographic studies in order to identify core sites that have not experienced much microbial activity, or contamination by terrestrial sources with much higher C/N ratios.Raymo, M. E., et al. \\"Mid-Pliocene warmth: stronger greenhouse and stronger conveyor.\\" Marine Micropaleontology 27.1 (1996): 313-326. Lastly, ammonia, the product of the second reduction reaction, which reduces nitrate and produces nitrogen gas and ammonia, is easily adsorbed on clay mineral surfaces and protected from bacteria. This has been proposed as an explanation for lower than expected C/N signatures of organic carbon in sediments that have undergone post-depositional diagenesis. Ammonium produced from the remineralisation of organic material, exists in elevated concentrations (1 - >14ŒºM) within cohesive shelf sea sediments found in the Celtic Sea (depth: 1‚Äì30 cm). The depth of sediment exceeds 1m and would be a suitable study site to carry out paleolimnology experiments with C:N.  Lacustrine  Unlike in marine sediments, diagenesis does not pose a large threat to the integrity of the C/N ratio in lacustrine sediments. Though wood from living trees around lakes have consistently higher C/N ratios than wood buried in sediment, the change in elemental composition is not large enough to remove the vascular versus non-vascular plant signals due to the refractory nature of terrestrial organic matter.Meyers, P. A. \\"Preservation of Elemental and Isotopic Source Identification of Sedimentary Organic-Matter.\\" Chemical Geology 114, no. 3-4 (Jun 1 1994): 289-302. Abrupt shifts in the C/N ratio down-core can be interpreted as shifts in the organic source material. For example, two separate studies on Mangrove Lake, Bermuda and Lake Yunoko, Japan show irregular, abrupt fluctuations between C/N around 11 to around 18. These fluctuations are attributed to shifts from mainly algal dominance to land- based vascular dominance.Ishiwatari, R., N. Takamatsu, and T. Ishibashi. \\"Separation of autochthonous and allochthonous materials in lacustrine sediments by density differences.\\"Japanese Journal of Limnology 38 (1977). Results of studies that show abrupt shifts in algal dominance and vascular dominance often lead to conclusions about the state of the lake during these distinct periods of isotopic signatures. Times in which lakes are dominated by algal signals suggest the lake is a deep-water lake, while times in which lakes are dominated by vascular plant signals suggest the lake is shallow, dry, or marshy. Using the C/N ratio in conjunction with other sediment observations, such as physical variations, D/H isotopic analyses of fatty acids and alkanes, and Œ¥13C analyses on similar biomarkers can lead to further regional climate interpretations that describe the larger phenomena at play.

They have traditionally been viewed as an extant sister group of the butterfly superfamily Papilionoidea. In 1986, Scoble combined all species into a single genus Macrosoma, comprising 35 currently recognized and entirely Neotropical species, as a novel concept of butterflies. Taxonomy and systematics Hedylidae were previously treated as a tribe of Geometridae: Oenochrominae, the \\"Hedylicae\\". Prout considered they might even merit treatment as their own family. Scoble first considered them to be a hitherto unrecognised group of butterflies and also suggested Hedylidae might possibly constitute the sister group of the \\"true\\" butterflies (Papilionoidea), rather than of (Hesperioidea + Papilionoidea). Weintraub and Miller argued against this placement (but see). In 1995, Weller and Pashley found that molecular data did indeed place Hedylidae with the butterflies and a more comprehensive study in 2005 based on 57 exemplar taxa, three genes and 99 morphological characters, recovered the genus Macrosoma as sister to the (\\"Papilionoidea\\" + Hesperioidea). However, the most recent phylogenetic analyses shows that skippers are true butterflies and therefore within the clade Papilionoidea, whereas the hedylids are a sister group that may be closely related to the obtectomeran moths. This is contrary to some earlier studies that had shown both the skippers and hedylids as being nested within the Papilionoidea. Since there are no obvious gaps between supposed species groups, according to basic morphological structure, Scoble (1986) synonymised the five pre-existing genera of Hedylidae (33 of which had been described in Phellinodes) into just one genus. However, a phylogenetic analysis of all Macrosoma species is still needed. Nomenclatural notes In zoological nomenclature, numerous junior homonyms of Macrosoma (H√ºbner, 1818) exist, (Macrosoma Leach 1819 (a reptile), Macrosoma de Haan 1826 (Odonata), Macrosoma Robineau-Desvoidy 1830 (Macrosoma multisulcata Berlese 1913 and M. floralis, Diptera: Muscidae), Macrosoma Brandt 1835 (Coelenterata), Macrosoma Hope 1837 (Coleoptera), Macrosoma Lioy 1864 or 1865 (Diptera: Sarcophagidae), Macrosoma Hammer 1979Hammer, M. (1979). Investigations on the oribatid fauna of Java. K. Dan. Vidensk. Selsk. Biol. Skr., 22(9): 34. (M.rugosa; Acarina: Oribatidae). To add to this potential confusion in lists of names, there exist two junior homonyms of Hedyle Guen√©e, 1857: Hedyle Bergh, 1895 (sea slugs in the order Opisthobranchia: superfamily \\"Acochlidioidea\\", family Hedylopsidae Odhner, 1952 that are currently placed in the genus Hedylopsis Thiele, 1931), and Hedyle Malmgren 1865 (a polychaete worm). The sea slug family name \\"Hedylidae Bergh, 1895\\" (type species Hedyle weberi Bergh, 1895) is thus also invalid. Morphology and identification The eggs of hedylid moths have an upright configuration and are variable in shape: in Macrosoma inermis they are particularly narrow and spindle- shaped,Scoble, M.J. (1990a). A catalogue of the Hedylidae (Lepidoptera: Hedyloidea), with descriptions of two new species. Entomologica Scandinavica, 21: 113-119. resembling those of some Pieridae, and in the case of M. tipulata they are more barrel-shaped,Lourido, G., Silva, N.M., Motta, C.S. 2007.

Neotropical Entomology, 36(1):102-106. like certain Nymphalidae. The larvae resemble (probably convergently) those of Apaturinae. Adult hedylids resemble geometer moths. They share many morphological and genetic characteristics with both the superfamilies Papilionoidea and the Hesperioidea. The abdomen is very long and slim, like many Neotropical butterflies of the subfamilies Ithomiinae and Heliconiinae, hence the name of one Macrosoma species \\"heliconiaria\\". Unlike other butterflies, however, the antennae are un-clubbed, but rather filiform or bipectinate. Unlike the family Geometridae, in which they had been placed by the geometer expert L.B.Prout, hedylids lack tympanic organs at the base of the abdomen, but have them on the wings (see under Behaviour). Unlike other butterflies, however (except the unique case of the remarkable Australian skipper butterfly Euschemon rafflesia, whose males possess these structures), the single-spined frenulum and retinaculum are not lost or reduced in males, except in three Macrosoma species where there is no functional wing coupling system. The retinaculum is always lost in females, and the frenulum may be vestigial. The family have been fully catalogued and illustrated in an identification guide.Scoble, M.J. (1990b).

Biology and host plants The life history of Macrosoma heliconiaria was originally described from plants of Byttneria aculeata in Mexico. This was a historical breakthrough into the biology of hedylids. In this study, Kendall commented notably \\"I thought the larvae might represent a satyr species, but when the first larva pupated I was sure it was a pierid. The first adult emerged as a complete surprise. The pupa...is secured by girdle and cremaster, not unlike a pierid\\". Macrosoma cascaria was later also reared on this plant in Panama. More life histories are now known. From these data, known host plants span a wide range of (according to the APG II system) rosid dicotyledonous plants, including the rosid order Myrtales family Melastomataceae (genera Miconia, Conostegia, and Ossaea), the eurosid I order Malpighiales, families Euphorbiaceae (Croton), and Malpighiaceae (Byrsonima), the eurosid II orders Sapindales, family Rutaceae (Zanthoxylum) and more commonlyJanz, N. and Nylin, S.

Further it should have dimension d equal to :p^{n - 1} - 1.\\\\ The key condition is in terms of the d-th Newton polynomial sd, evaluated on the (algebraic) total Chern class of the tangent bundle of V. This number :s_d(V)\\\\ should not be divisible by p2, it being known it is divisible by p. Examples These include (n = 2) cases of the Severi‚ÄìBrauer variety and (p = 2) Pfister forms.

These moderate sized moths are 8‚Äì17 mm in wingspan and have previously been embedded within several lepidopteran superfamilies (Tineoidea: Psychidae, Urodoidea, Sesioidea and in several families of Yponomeutoidea), but Galacticidae is currently placed in its own superfamily at the base of the natural group Apoditrysia (Dugdale et al., 1999 [1998]; May, 2004). Note: the superfamily was unintentionally called \\"Galaticoidea\\" in Dugdale et al. (1999) [1998]. The relationships of Galacticidae need reassessment with new characters including DNA data . The genus Homadaula looks remarkably like the yponomeutid genera Prays and Atemelia and some species are reminiscent of \\"small ermine\\" moths. Despite the spined abdominal segments of the pupae and a few other characters (Minet, 1986) some possess structural similarities to yponomeutids as well and have similar larval behaviour so their removal from the Yponomeutoidea has been questioned (Mey, 2004). The family is distributed in the Old World from Africa and Madagascar to Asia, Australia and New Caledonia. The richest genus is Homadaula with eight species. The mimosa webworm (Homadaula anisocentra) is a pest of ornamental plants , which has been introduced to eastern North America (Moriuti, 1963; Dugdale et al., 1999).

It is a colorless to yellow mineral crystallizing in the trigonal system. The prismatic crystals are typically colorless, turning white on partial dehydration. It is part of the ettringite-group which includes other sulfates such as thaumasite and bentorite.Ettringite-group. Mindat.org Discovery and occurrence Ettringite, 6.5√ó3.2 cm. N'Chwaning Mines, Kalahari manganese fields, Northern Cape Province, South Africa Ettringite was first described in 1874 by J.Lehmann,Lehmann, J. (1874): √úber den Ettringit, ein neues Mineral in Kalkeinschl√ºssen der Lava von Ettringen (Laacher Gebiet). N. Jb. Mineral. Geol. Pal√§ont., 273-275 for an occurrence near the Ettringer Bellerberg Volcano, Ettringen, Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany. It occurs within metamorphically altered limestone adjacent to igneous intrusive rocks or within xenoliths. It also occurs as weathering crusts on larnite in the Hatrurim Formation of Israel. It occurs associated with portlandite, afwillite and hydrocalumite at Scawt Hill, Ireland and with afwillite, hydrocalumite, mayenite and gypsum in the Hatrurim Formation. It has also been reported from the Zeilberg quarry, Maroldsweisach, Bavaria; at Boiss√©jour, near Clermont-Ferrand, Puy-de-D√¥me, Auvergne, France; the N‚ÄôChwaning mine, Kuruman district, Cape Province, South Africa; in the US, occurrences were found in spurrite-merwinite-gehlenite skarn at the 910 level of the Commercial quarry, Crestmore, Riverside County, CaliforniaCarpenter, A.B.

Occurrence in cement SEM image of fractured hardened cement paste, showing plates of calcium hydroxide and needles of ettringite (micron scale) In concrete chemistry ettringite is a hexacalcium aluminate trisulfate hydrate, of general formula: :(CaO)6(Al2O3)(SO3)3¬∑32H2O or :(CaO)3(Al2O3)(CaSO4)3¬∑32H2O. Ettringite is formed in hydrated Portland cement system as a result of the reaction of calcium aluminate with calcium sulfate, both present in Portland cement. Ettringite, the more prominent representative of AFt phases or (Al2O3-Fe2O3-tri), can also be synthesized in the laboratory by reacting stoichiometric amounts of calcium, aluminium and sulfate in water. :C3A + 3 CaSO4 ‚Üí ettringite In the cement system, the presence of ettringite depends on the ratio of calcium sulfate to tri-calcium aluminate (C3A); when this ratio is low, ettringite forms during early hydration and then converts to the calcium aluminate monosulfate (AFm phase or (Al2O3-Fe2O3-mono)). When the ratio is intermediate, only a portion of the ettringite converts to AFm and both can coexist, while ettringite is unlikely to convert to AFm at high ratios. The following characters designate standard notations: :C = CaO :S = SiO2 :A = Al2O3 :F = Fe2O3 :SÃÖ = SO3 :H = H2O :K = K2O :N = Na2O :m = mono :t = tri  AFt and AFm phases  * AFt: abbreviation for \\"alumina, ferric oxide, tri-sulfate\\" or (Al2O3 ‚Äì Fe2O3 ‚Äì tri). It represents a group of calcium sulfoaluminate hydrates. AFt has the general formula where X represents a doubly charged anion or, sometimes, two singly charged anions. Ettringite is the most common and important member of the AFt group (X in this case denoting sulfate). * AFm: abbreviation for \\"alumina, ferric oxide, mono- sulfate\\" or (Al2O3 ‚Äì Fe2O3 ‚Äì mono). It represents another group of calcium aluminate hydrates with general formula [Ca2(Al,Fe)(OH)6)]¬∑X¬∑nH2O where X represents a singly charged anion or 'half' a doubly charged anion. X may be one of many anions. The most important anions involved in Portland cement hycarbonate. Structure The mineral ettringite has a structure that runs parallel to the c axis -the needle axis-; in the middle of these two lie the sulfate ions and H2O molecules, the space group is P31c. Ettringite crystal system is trigonal, crystals are elongated and in a needle like shape, occurrence of disorder or twining is common, which affects the intercolumn material.Moore A E , Taylor H F W (1970), Crystal structure of ettringit, Acta Crystallographica Section B , 26 p.386-393 The first X-ray study was done by Bannister, Hey & Bernal (1936), which found that the crystal unit cell is of a hexagonal form with a=11.26 and c=21.48 with space group P63/mmcand Z=2. From observations on dehydration and chemical formulas there were suggestions of the structure being composed of Ca2+ and Al(OH)63‚àí, were between them lie SO42‚àí ions and H2O molecules. Further X-ray studies ensued; namely Wellin (1956) which determined the crystal structure of thaumasite, and Besjak & Jelenic (1966) which gave affirmation of the structure nature of ettringite. An ettringite sample extracted from Scawt Hill was analysed by C. E. Tilley, the crystal was 1.1 x 0.8 0.5 mm, with specific gravity of 1.772¬±0.002, the density was determined by immersing the sample in a solution of carbon tetrachloride mixed with bromoform. The crystal showed five prism faces of the form m {100} and a small face a{110}, with no pyramidal or basal faces, upon x-ray diffraction a Lauer gram along the c-axis revealed a hexagonal axis with vertical planes of symmetry, this study showed that the structure has a hexagonal and not a rhombohedral lattice.Bannister, M.A. (1935): Ettringite from Scawt Hill, Co. Antrim. Mineralogical Magazine, 24, 324-329 further studies conducted on synthetic ettringite by use of x-ray and powder diffraction confirmed earlier assumptions and analyses.Goetz-Neunhoeffer, F. and Neubauer, J. (2006): Refined ettringite (Ca6Al2(SO4)3(OH)12¬∑26H2O) structure for quantitative X-ray diffraction analysis. Powder Diffr. 21, 4-11. Upon analyzing the structure of both ettringite and thaumasite, it was deduced that both minerals have hexagonal structures, but different space groups. Ettringite crystals have a P31c with a=11.224 √Ö, c= 21,108 √Ö, while thaumasite crystals fall into space group P63 with a= 11.04 √Ö, c= 10.39 √Ö. While these two minerals form a solid solution, the difference in space groups lead to discontinuities in unit cell parameters. Differences between structures of ettringite and thaumasite arise from the columns of cations and anions: Ettringite cation columns are composed of Ca3[Al(OH)6¬∑12H2O]3+, which run parallel to the c axis, and the other columns of sulfate anions and water molecules in channels parallel to these columns. In contrast, thaumasite consists of a cylindrical column of Ca3[Si(OH)6¬∑12H2O]3+ in the c axis, with sulfate and carbonate anions in channels between these columns which contain water molecules as well.Rachel L. Norman a,b, Sandra E. Dann a, Simon C. Hogg c, Caroline A. Kirk. (2013): Synthesis and structural characterisation of new ettringite and thaumasite type phases: Ca6[Ga(OH)6.12H2O]2(SO4)3.2H2O and Ca6[M(OH)6.12H2O]2(SO4)2(CO3)2, M = Mn, Sn, Solid State Sciences 25. Further research Ongoing research on ettringite and cement phase minerals is in general to find ways to immobilize wastes and heavy metals from soils and the environment; this can be done by use of the proper cement phase forming mineral by use of lattice to extract according elements. For example, it is reported that copper immobilization at high pH can be achieved through formation of CSH/CAH and ettringite.Moon DH, Park JW, Cheong KH, Hyun S, Koutsospyros A, Park JH, Ok YS. (2013): Stabilization of lead and copper contaminated firing range soil using calcined oyster shells and fly ash, Environ Geochem Health 35 It is suggested that the crystal morphology of ettringite Ca6Al2(SO4)3(OH)12¬∑26H2O can incorporate a variety of divalent ions: Cu2+, Pb2+, Cd2+ and Zn2+, which can substitute for the Ca2+ by incorporating these ions into the lattice.

As the result of their fast-playing style and lyrics (often covering death, politics and social issues), the band has been compared to that of their thrash metal contemporaries such as Testament, Vio-lence, Forbidden, Sacred Reich and Nuclear Assault. Career Atrophy, originally named Heresy, was formed in 1986 by Chris Lykins, James Gulotta, and Brian Zimmerman. Tim Kelly and Rick Skowron later joined the band. In 1987, the band produced two cassette demos and were subsequently picked up by thrash metal label, Roadrunner Records. They recorded two albums: Socialized Hate in 1988 and Violent By Nature in 1990. These albums saw Atrophy tour the U.S. and Europe, or play selected shows, with the likes of Slayer, Exodus, Suicidal Tendencies, Testament, Sacred Reich, Dark Angel, Forced Entry, Coroner, D.R.I., Flotsam and Jetsam, Death Angel and Venom. Following the European tour, Lykins left the band to pursue a medical school course. Atrophy was subsequently dropped by their record label. Attempts were made in the early 1990s to continue without Lykins and record a third album; by 1993, however, the band had broken up. Atrophy reformed in 2015 with a new lineup, including three original members (Zimmerman, Gulotta and Kelly) and two different guitarists as the replacements of Lykins and Skowron (Casper Garret and Rich Olsen, who was later replaced by Bobby Stein).

History Foundation The school was set up in 1948 in the then Portuguese colony of Goa, when formal schooling for women was unusual. It was launched by the Apostolic Carmel Congregation of Mangalore. On 1 January 1948, two nuns ‚Äì Mother Mercedes who later became the first Superior of St Mary's and Sr Augsta ‚Äì were sent from Mangalore to Margao where they joined two other members of the Congregation, Sr Nympha and Sr Ephigenia. The four went to Mapusa and together founded the school, which completed six decades of service in 2008. Some 130 girls were taken over from the nearby Jesuit school currently called St Britto. By June 1948, the student number rose to 187. The first inspection took place in October of that year, though the school was not yet officially recognised. Facing a lack of water, very little money, and hard times, they were housed in the building which would later become the kindergarten. In 1950, the school opened a boarding house with six boarders. On 28 August 1950, the school was officially recognised. In 1952, the convent sent up its first batch of 14 students for the Matriculation examination. More students, Lyceum building By 1959, the nuns had a chance to extend their education to more girls. In 1963, they were able to move into the Lyceum building. Following the end of Portuguese rule in Goa, Mapusa developed into a centre for the surrounding areas. Public transport improved and many more students joined the school. Land near the convent Help came in the form of land next to the convent, which by now was located some distance from the school. This was a gift from the family of Sisters Carmela AC and Rosanne AC. Plans for the new school were drawn up, but the prospects of raising the Rs 48,00,000 did not seem promising. However, in the space of two years a structure was built near the convent. Sr Marcilla took over as principal in 1989 and Sr Thelma was superior.

In 1997 she took part in the first ever Atlantic Rowing Race, the Port St Charles Barbados Atlantic Rowing Race, successfully crossing the Atlantic Ocean unsupported in wooden rowing boat in 101 days with her son Daniel Byles. A decade later in 2007, she and her son were united in adventure once again when, together with Richard Profit, they successfully walked and skied from Resolute, Nunavut to the Magnetic North Pole in 20 days and 5 hours. She currently holds four Guinness World Records. Background In the 1960s and early 1970s Meek worked in the British film industry, initially in continuity and later as assistant to the producer. She worked with many household names including Roger Moore, Ian McShane, Sammy Davis Junior and Jerry Lewis, and helped to make some iconic British television programs including Randall and Hopkirk, Department S, The Champions and Catweazle. Her film credits include the 1970 film Puppet on a Chain and the 1972 film Pope Joan. After leaving the film industry to start a family, Meek moved to Saudi Arabia with her husband and two children Rebecca (Becky) Byles and Daniel (Dan) Byles M.P or North Warwick (2010-15) where she worked for a time for the United States Geological Survey. In 1983, after separating from her husband, she returned to the UK and settled in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire where she opened a children's clothes shop. Over the next ten years, Meek became the first female Chairman of the Chipping Norton Chamber of Commerce, was elected as a Town Councillor and then Town Mayor. She bought and ran a local restaurant, and was headhunted to become the small business representative on the Heart of England Training and Enterprise Council (TEC). Since moving on from Chipping Norton, Meek has owned and run several restaurants, including the prestigious De Courceys in South Wales, and has been a wedding organiser and events manager. In September 2013 when she married the leading international public relations expert Peter Walker she became the first mother of a sitting MP to be married in the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft in the Palace of Westminster. Adventures and expeditions Exploring China, Australia and the world Following the death of Meek's second husband in 1993, she sold her business in Chipping Norton and spent her fiftieth year backpacking around the world. She travelled to Taiwan to study Mandarin at the National Taiwan Normal University before spending several months struggling to explore China, which as a single female traveller was not easy. She then continued around the world, spending her fiftieth birthday at Cape Tribulation in Australia. Atlantic rowing race 1997 After returning from her world trip, Meek was asked by her son Daniel Byles to join him in entering the world's first ocean rowing race. Despite neither of them being rowers or sailors, she accepted and they went on to successfully row from Tenerife to Barbados in their boat Carpe Diem. Their unsupported crossing took 100 days, 18 hours and 57 minutes. The story of their adventure has been recorded in at least three Chicken Soup for the Soul books. In rowing across the Atlantic, the pair achieved two Guinness World Records: they became the first mother and son team to row any ocean; and at 53 Meek became the oldest person at the time to row any ocean, although since 2005 this record has been held by Pavel Rezvoy (66). Polar race 2007 Ten years after their successful ocean row, Meek turned the tables on her son and asked him to join her in entering the Polar Race 2007, which he accepted. In doing so, they set two additional world records in the Arctic. The mother and son pair, along with teammate Richard Profit, walked and skied from Resolute in Canada to the North Magnetic Pole. They survived the worst ice conditions for years, a near catastrophic tent fire and areas of open water and slush to successfully reach the Pole in 20 days and 5 hours. In doing so they set a new world record as the first mother and son team to reach any Pole by foot on 2 May 2007, and Meek became the oldest woman to reach the North Magnetic Pole by foot. Geographic north pole 2008 Less than 12 months after setting a world record at the North Magnetic Pole, Meek was headhunted by David Hempleman- Adams to join his expedition to the Geographic North Pole to highlight the effects of climate change on ice levels in the Arctic. Also taking part was the renowned Norwegian explorer Rune Gjeldnes, and Hempleman-Adams' 15-year- old daughter Camilla. The expedition successfully reached the Pole on 13 April 2008, where they met and played cricket with a team from the Indian Navy. Meek is believed to be the first British woman to reach both the Magnetic and the Geographic North Poles by foot within the space of 12 months. South Pole - all women's expedition 2019 In 2017 - ten years on from her race to the magnetic North Pole, Jan started planning a 20-day all-women's expedition to the South Pole in 2020/21. The Polar-Maidens expedition has been structured to honour the unfinished trek to the South Pole by Tom Crean, the Irish born member of the British navy and hero of the Shackleton and Scott Antarctic expeditions. Working with one of the leading experts in extreme medicine the team with a 50-year age range will monitor the physical and mental impact of the years training and preparation and the trek itself with 12 hour days skiing in extreme conditions of cold with altitude for up to 20 days before reaching the Pole. How will a 75 year old deal with conditions compared to a 24 year old, and a superfit breast cancer survivor at sixty react, or a 30 year Indian super model old who regularly tackles the Himalayas compare with the recovery rates of Tom Crean's granddaughter. With two Indian members in the team the Polar-Maidens expedition their involvement has been feted by Indian Prime Minister Modi as an example of Indian enterprise and achievement and forms part of the Living Bridge between India, the UK and the Irish Republic. A camera crew will follow the Polar-Maidens for a whole year filming as they train together and individually during the year and then on their 20-day trek to the pole to produce a series of 6 programmes to be broadcast worldwide Motivational speaking Following her successful Atlantic crossing in 1997, Meek entered the after dinner speaking circuit, where she discovered she had a knack for public speaking. As a lady over fifty Meek is an unorthodox adventurer, and this has led to a career as a highly successful professional motivational speaker and Cruise Line lecturer. Her fees from commercial speaking engagements and appearances are used to support her greatest love speaking to children, their parents and teachers inspiring them use her maxim 'why not' when faced with any challenge. Charities and organisations Returning to the UK after rowing the Atlantic, Meek's achievement was recognised when she was made a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. For several years Meek served as a trustee of the Ocean Rowing Society, standing down from that position in 2005. Meek and her son Dan Byles were founding trustees of The Carpe Diem Foundation a charity aimed at helping ordinary people to undertake extraordinary achievements. Dan's election to Parliament in 2010 saw the charity closed and its monies distributed to other charitable organisations. In 2016 Jan was elected to the XX (Twenty Club) based in Hasting established by H. Rider Haggard In 2018 Jan led the establishment of the INSPIRATIONELLE Foundation a not for profit company limited by guarantee which much like the Carpe Diem Foundation aims to support women of all ages wanting to do something extra‚Äìordinary and provide help and funding to enable other 'women less ordinary' to take the time to speak to schools, pupils, teachers and parents, other groups and organisations and inspire them to ask why not when a challenge arises.

Previously they have been divided in two subfamilies Epermeniinae and Ochromolopinae (e.g. Common, 1990: 321) but this is no longer maintained since the last group is probably hierarchically nested within the first (Dugdale et al., 1999). They are presently placed in their own superfamily but have previously been placed among the Yponomeutoidea or Copromorphoidea with which they share some features. Their systematic placement among the apoditrysian group \\"Obtectomera\\" (having pupal segments I-IV immobile) is however uncertain. They show some morphological similarities to the \\"plume moths\\" (Alucitoidea and Pterophoroidea), for example the wing fringe has similar groups of scales (Dugdale et al., 1999). There are also some similarities to Schreckensteinioidea, for example spiny legs and at least in some species an open-network cocoon. The genus Thambotricha from New Zealand may be the sister group of all other extant members. The most important genera are Epermenia, Ochromolopis and Gnathifera. The group has been extensively revised and catalogued by Dr Reinhard Gaedike (e.g. Gaedike, 1977, 1979). Identification Epermeniidae are small narrow-winged moths, having a span of 7‚Äì20 mm, with conspicuous whorls of bristles on their legs, lacking spines on the abdomen unlike some similar moths. The smoothly scaled head bears no ocelli or \\"chaetosemata\\". They are most easily confused with Stathmopodinae (Oecophoridae), which unlike epermeniids have the tarsi of the forelegs and midlegs without the whorls of spines, and whose proboscis is scaled at the base (Robinson et al., 1994, for further details). The projecting scale tufts on the inner margin of the hindwing is the easiest field character (Common, 1990). (See External links: Tufts) Distribution Epermeniidae occur worldwide in both temperate and tropical regions and especially in montane areas (Robinson et al., 1994), but are sparsely known from the Afrotropics. Gnathifera occurs from Australia to New Caledonia; Epermenia ranges from the Palaearctic to Indo-Australia and the Pacific islands (Holloway et al., 2001). Behaviour Epermeniidae are nocturnal as adults and well-camouflaged. They rest parallel to the surface with their wings held over their back in a tent-like manner (Robinson et al., 1994). Biology The caterpillars feed inside almost any plant parts (fruits, seeds, galls, leaves or flowers), sometimes in a mine or sometimes exposed or under silk on the leaf surface; unlike some Lepidoptera the pupa is not extruded from the cocoon (Robinson et al., 1994) and may be found in its fine open-network cocoon on the plant or amongst debris on the ground (Common, 1990). Host plants Many species in Europe feed on umbels of Apiaceae, and Epermenia chaerophyllella is a pest of cultivated species (Dugdale et al., 1999). Other species feed on the parasitic plant families Santalaceae (e.g. the Australian quandong moth) and Loranthaceae, or on Pinaceae, Pittosporaceae and Leguminosae.Search Results: Family Epermeniidae.

In the Plancherel measure, such representations have positive measure. The name comes from the fact that they are exactly the representations that occur discretely in the decomposition of the regular representation. Properties If G is unimodular, an irreducible unitary representation œÅ of G is in the discrete series if and only if one (and hence all) matrix coefficient :\\\\langle \\\\rho(g)\\\\cdot v, w \\\\rangle \\\\, with v, w non-zero vectors is square-integrable on G, with respect to Haar measure. When G is unimodular, the discrete series representation has a formal dimension d, with the property that :d\\\\int \\\\langle \\\\rho(g)\\\\cdot v, w \\\\rangle \\\\overline{\\\\langle \\\\rho(g)\\\\cdot x, y \\\\rangle}dg =\\\\langle v, x \\\\rangle\\\\overline{\\\\langle w, y \\\\rangle} for v, w, x, y in the representation. When G is compact this coincides with the dimension when the Haar measure on G is normalized so that G has measure 1. Semisimple groups classified the discrete series representations of connected semisimple groups G. In particular, such a group has discrete series representations if and only if it has the same rank as a maximal compact subgroup K. In other words, a maximal torus T in K must be a Cartan subgroup in G. (This result required that the center of G be finite, ruling out groups such as the simply connected cover of SL(2,R).) It applies in particular to special linear groups; of these only SL(2,R) has a discrete series (for this, see the representation theory of SL(2,R)). Harish-Chandra's classification of the discrete series representations of a semisimple connected Lie group is given as follows. If L is the weight lattice of the maximal torus T, a sublattice of it where t is the Lie algebra of T, then there is a discrete series representation for every vector v of :L + œÅ, where œÅ is the Weyl vector of G, that is not orthogonal to any root of G. Every discrete series representation occurs in this way. Two such vectors v correspond to the same discrete series representation if and only if they are conjugate under the Weyl group WK of the maximal compact subgroup K. If we fix a fundamental chamber for the Weyl group of K, then the discrete series representation are in 1:1 correspondence with the vectors of L + œÅ in this Weyl chamber that are not orthogonal to any root of G. The infinitesimal character of the highest weight representation is given by v (mod the Weyl group WG of G) under the Harish-Chandra correspondence identifying infinitesimal characters of G with points of :t ‚äó C/WG. So for each discrete series representation, there are exactly :|WG|/|WKdiscrete series representations with the same infinitesimal character. Harish-Chandra went on to prove an analogue for these representations of the Weyl character formula. In the case where G is not compact, the representations have infinite dimension, and the notion of character is therefore more subtle to define since it is a Schwartz distribution (represented by a locally integrable function), with singularities. The character is given on the maximal torus T by :(-1)^{\\\\frac{\\\\dim(G)-\\\\dim(K)}{2}} {\\\\sum_{w\\\\in W_K}\\\\det(w)e^{w(v)}\\\\over \\\\prod_{(v,\\\\alpha)>0} \\\\left (e^{\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2}}-e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2}} \\\\right )} When G is compact this reduces to the Weyl character formula, with v = Œª + œÅ for Œª the highest weight of the irreducible representation (where the product is over roots Œ± having positive inner product with the vector v). Harish-Chandra's regularity theorem implies that the character of a discrete series representation is a locally integrable function on the group. Limit of discrete series representations Points v in the coset L + œÅ orthogonal to roots of G do not correspond to discrete series representations, but those not orthogonal to roots of K are related to certain irreducible representations called limit of discrete series representations. There is such a representation for every pair (v,C) where v is a vector of L + œÅ orthogonal to some root of G but no orthogonal to any root of K corresponding to a wall of C, and C is a Weyl chamber of G containing v. (In the case of discrete series representations there is only one Weyl chamber containing v so it is not necessary to include it explicitly.) Two pairs (v,C) give the same limit of discrete series representation if and only if they are conjugate under the Weyl group of K. Just as for discrete series representations v gives the infinitesimal character. There are at most |WG|/|WKlimit of discrete series representations with any given infinitesimal character. Limit of discrete series representations are tempered representations, which means roughly that they only just fail to be discrete series representations. Constructions of the discrete series Harish-Chandra's original construction of the discrete series was not very explicit. Several authors later found more explicit realizations of the discrete series. * constructed most of the discrete series representations in the case when the symmetric space of G is hermitian. * constructed many of the discrete series representations for arbitrary G. * conjectured, and proved, a geometric analogue of the Borel-Bott-Weil theorem, for the discrete series, using L2 cohomology instead of the coherent sheaf cohomology used in the compact case. *An application of the index theorem, constructed all the discrete series representations in spaces of harmonic spinors. Unlike most of the previous constructions of representations, the work of Atiyah and Schmid did not use Harish-Chandra's existence results in their proofs. *Discrete series representations can also be constructed by cohomological parabolic induction using Zuckerman functors.

In the mythic tradition of ancient Rome, they fill the 400-year gap between the settlement of Aeneas in Italy and the founding of the city of Rome by Romulus.C. F. L'Homond Selections from Viri Romae p.1 It was this line of descent to which the Julii claimed kinship.Dionysius of Halicarnassus Roman Antiquities I.70.4 The traditional line of the Alban kings ends with Numitor, the grandfather of Romulus and Remus. One later king, Gaius Cluilius, is mentioned by Roman historians, although his relation to the original line, if any, is unknown; and after his death, a few generations after the time of Romulus, the city was destroyed by Tullus Hostilius, the third King of Rome, and its population transferred to Alba's daughter city.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, i. 23‚Äì30. Background The city of Alba Longa, often abbreviated Alba, was a Latin settlement in the montes Albani, or Alban Hills, near the present site of Castel Gandolfo in Latium.Donna Rosenberg. World Mythology. NTC Pub. Group, 1994. Pp. 111. Although the exact location remains difficult to prove, there is archaeological evidence of Iron Age settlements in the area traditionally identified as the site.Mommsen Book I Chapter iii In Roman mythology, Alba was founded by Ascanius, the son of Aeneas, as a colony of Lavinium, the original settlement of Trojan refugees and native Latins, which it quickly eclipsed. There is some uncertainty in the tradition as to Ascanius' mother; in some accounts he was the son of Lavinia, and grandson of Latinus, the native king who welcomed Aeneas and the Trojans; his elder half brother, Iulus, was the son of Creusa, Aeneas' first wife, who died in the sack of Troy. This was the account favoured by Livy; in other versions, Ascanius was the son of Creusa; Dionysius and Virgil follow this account. However, the two differ where Vergil claims Ascanius and Iulus were the same; Dionysius, on the other hand, makes Iulus the son of Ascanius. In all accounts, Ascanius was the founder and first king of Alba Longa, while Iulus was claimed as the ancestor of the Julian gens.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, i. 3.Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Romaike Archaiologia, i. 47 ff.Publius Vergilius Maro, Aeneid. Eratosthenes, the most influential of the ancient chronologists, reckoned that the sack of Troy occurred in 1184 BC, more than four centuries before the traditional founding of Rome, in 753.Eratosthenes Chronographiai fragment The history of the Alban kings conveniently filled that gap with a continuous line leading from Aeneas to Romulus, thus serving as a mythical justification for the close ties between Rome and the rest of Latium, and enhancing the status of Roman and Latin families who claimed descent from the original Trojan settlers or their Alban descendants. Such was the eagerness in the late Republic to claim a Trojan pedigree that fifteen different lists of the Alban kings from Aeneas to Romulus survive.Gary D. Farney, Ethnic Identity and Aristocratic Competition in Republican Rome (Cambridge University Press, 2007), pp. 55‚Äì56. Statue of Ascanius from Emerita Augusta. History Kings of Latium When Aeneas and the Trojan refugees landed on the shores of the Laurentian plain, they encountered the Latins, led by their eponymous king, Latinus.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, i. 1. The Latins were aborigines; that is, the original inhabitants of Latium, a title sometimes used to refer to the Latins before the arrival of Aeneas. Latinus was the son of Faunus, and grandson of Picus, the first king of Latium, who was in turn the son of Saturn. This was the most usual account, followed by Virgil in the Aeneid, and by Eusebius, but there were also several other versions.Publius Vergilius Maro, Aeneid, vii.Eusebius of Caesarea, Chronicon. Picus was also said to be the son of Mars, rather than Saturn. According to Justin, Faunus was Latinus' maternal grandfather, and was the son of Jupiter, rather than Picus; in this account Saturn was the first king of the Latins.M. Junianus Justinus Historiarum Philippicarum liber XLIII, 1 translated by Rev. John Selby Watson 1853Sextus Aurelius Victor, De Origo Gentis Romanae (attributed). According to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Latinus was the son of Hercules, and merely pretended to be the son of Faunus; Aeneas arrived in the thirty-fifth year of his reign over the Aborigines.Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Romaike Archaiologia, i. 44. Evander and Janus are also sometimes described as ancient kings of the Aborigines; but Livy describes Evander as a king of the Arcadians, as does Virgil, who makes him an ally of Aeneas in the war against the Rutuli.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, i. 5‚Äì7.Publius Vergilius Maro, Aeneid, viii. In his Saturnalia, Macrobius describes Janus as sharing Latium with another king, known as Camese.Ambrosius Theodosius Macrobius, Saturnalia, i. 7. The Latins were alarmed by the arrival of the Trojans, and rushed to arms; according to some accounts, a battle was fought, in which Latinus was defeated, and a peace concluded between the two groups, cemented by the marriage of Aeneas and Lavinia, daughter of the Latin king; in other versions battle was narrowly averted when the two leaders chose to parley before hostilities could begin, and Aeneas impressed his host with his noble bearing and woeful story, leading to an alliance. Aeneas then established the town of Lavinium, named after his young bride, with a mixed population of Trojans and Latins.Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Romaike Archaiologia, i. 57‚Äì59. But the new settlers and their alliance with Latinus soon encountered threats from two neighboring peoples. First the Rutuli, whose prince, Turnus, had previously been betrothed to Lavinia, marched against them. The new allies defeated the Rutuli, but Latinus was slain in the fighting, whereupon Aeneas assumed the leadership of both Trojans and Latins, declaring that henceforth all of his followers should be known as Latins. Subsequently, Mezentius, king of the Etruscan city of Caere, led an army against the Latins; he too was defeated after fierce fighting, but Aeneas fell in battle, or died soon afterward, and was buried on the banks of the Numicus, where he was later regarded as Jupiter Indiges, the local god.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, i. 2.Publius Vergilius Maro, Aeneid, x, xii.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, William Smith, Editor.Barthold Niebuhr, History of Rome, vol. 1 (1871), p. 78. Because Ascanius was still a child, Lavinia acted as regent until he came of age. Livy describes her as a woman of great character, who was able to maintain the peace between the Latins and their Etruscan neighbors to the north; he also describes the boundary between Latium and Etruria, fixed by treaty after the battle between Aeneas and Mezentius as the river Albula, subsequently known as the Tiber. The Silvian Dynasty About thirty years after the founding of Lavinium, when the original Trojan settlement was flourishing and populous, Ascanius decided to establish a colony in the Alban Hills, which, as it was initially spread out along a ridge, became known as Alba Longa. Nothing further is written of Ascanius, who was succeeded by his son, Silvius, according to Livy. Silvius' name was reportedly derived from his having been born in the woods, and Dionysius records a different tradition, whereby he was not the son of Ascanius, but his half-brother, the son of Aeneas and Lavinia. In this account, Lavinia feared that Ascanius, already a young man upon the death of his father, would harm her or her child, as threats to his bloodline, and therefore hid in the woods, where she was sheltered by Tyrrhenus, the royal swineherd and a friend of her father, Latinus. She and her son emerged from hiding when the Latins accused Ascanius of having done away with his stepmother. Silvius then succeeded Ascanius as king of the Latins, in preference to Ascanius' son, Iulus, whom Dionysius identifies as the ancestor of the Julii. According to Dionysius, Ascanius died in the thirty-eighth year of his reign, counting from the death of Aeneas, rather than the founding of Alba Longa.Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Romaike Archaiologia, i. 70. Livy records that Silvius founded several colonies, later known as the Prisci Latini, or \\"Old Latins\\". According to Dionysius, he reigned for twenty-nine years. He was succeeded by his son, Aeneas Silvius, who assumed his father's name as a cognomen, or surname; henceforth all of his descendants bore the name \\"Silvius\\" in addition to their personal names. This was the same process by which the nomen gentilicium later developed throughout Italy. Aeneas reigned for thirty-one years, and was succeeded by Latinus Silvius, who reigned for fifty-one years. The next king, Alba, reigned for thirty-nine years; according to Livy, he was succeeded by Atys, who reigned for twenty-six years, followed by Capys, who reigned twenty-eight years, and Capetus, who ruled for thirteen years.Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Romaike Archaiologia, i. 71. Capetus' successor, Tiberinus, was drowned crossing the river Albula, which was henceforth known as the Tiber in his memory; Dionysius says that he was slain in battle, and his body carried away by the river, after a reign of eight years. Tiberinus was followed by Agrippa, who ruled for forty-one years, and was succeeded by his son, Romulus Silvius, whom Dionysius calls Allocius. Livy states simply that he was struck by lightning, but Dionysius describes him as tyrannical and contemptuous of the gods; he imitated thunder and lightning, so as to appear like a god before the people, whereupon he and his whole household were destroyed by thunder and lightning, and overwhelmed by the waters of the adjoining lake, after a reign of nineteen years. He bequeathed his throne to Aventinus, who reigned for thirty-seven years, and was buried on the hill that bears his name. He was followed by Proca, who reigned for twenty-three years. Proca had two sons, Numitor and Amulius; his will was that he be succeeded by the elder son, Numitor, but Amulius drove out his brother, claiming the throne for himself. He had his brother's sons put to death, and appointed Numitor's daughter, Rhea Silvia, a Vestal Virgin, supposedly to do her honour, but in fact to ensure her perpetual virginity and prevent any further issue in her father's line. But Rhea was raped, and gave birth to twin sons, Romulus and Remus; she claimed that their father was Mars himself. Amulius had her thrown in prison, and ordered the infants thrown into the Tiber. But as the Tiber was swollen and its banks unreachable, the boys were exposed at the base of a fig tree, where they were suckled by a she-wolf, and then discovered by the shepherd Faustulus, who raised them with the aid of his wife, Acca Larentia. When they had grown to manhood, Romulus and Remus contrived to assassinate their wicked uncle, and restored their grandfather to the throne. According to Dionysius, Amulius reigned forty-two years.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, i. 3‚Äì6. The following year, which Dionysius makes the four hundred and thirty-second since the fall of Troy (i.e. 751 BC, only two years later than the era of Varro), Romulus and Remus set out to establish an Alban colony, which ultimately became the city of Rome. As Numitor had no further issue, the Silvian dynasty of Alba Longa ends with him.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, i. 6. After the Silvii Nothing further is reported of Alba Longa or its kings until the time of Tullus Hostilius, the third King of Rome, who according to tradition reigned from approximately 673 to 642 BC. During his reign, a series of cattle raids between Roman and Alban territory led to a declaration of war by Hostilius. At that time, the Alban king was Gaius Cluilius, whose relationship to the Silvii, if any, is entirely unknown. He set about arming the Alban populace and preparing for war, and constructed a large trench around the perimeter of Rome. However, he died before the two sides could engage in battle. It is not known whether he had any sons to succeed him in the kingship; the ancient historians report only that the military command was entrusted to Mettius Fufetius, who negotiated that the war be decided by a contest of champions; victory fell to Rome when the Horatii defeated the Curiatii, and peace was restored.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, i. 23. Later, Fufetius arranged to join Fidenae in a revolt against Roman authority, aided by the Etruscan city of Veii. At a crucial point in the battle between the Roman and Fidenate armies, Fufetius, in command of the Alban forces ostensibly allied with Rome, withdrew from the field. After this betrayal, Hostilius determined to revenge himself upon both Fufetius and Alba Longa. By a ruse he induced the surrender of the Albans, and had Fufetius torn asunder by horses; he then forcibly relocated the entire Alban populace to Rome, and razed the city of Alba Longa to the ground.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, i. 27‚Äì30. Development The traditions relating to the origins of Rome and the Latins belong to the realm of Roman mythology. This is not to say that the persons or events related in such traditions did not exist, or were solely the product of deliberate invention by later generations. But the earliest surviving records and accounts postdate the period of the Alban kings by several centuries, leaving little basis upon which to evaluate their historicity. In particular, the tradition connecting the founding of Alba Longa with the flight of Aeneas from Troy was only one of a number of stories about the origins of Rome, and although doubtless ancient, it shows the hallmarks of having developed over a long period. The first literary suggestions that the Romans were descended from survivors of the Trojan War are found among the Greek writers, many of whom considered the Romans descendants of the Achaeans, rather than the Trojans.Nathan Rosenstein and Robert Morstein-Marx (Editors), A Companion to the Roman Republic (2010), pp. 459-463. At the conclusion of the Theogony, Hesiod mentions Latinus and Agrius as sons of Odysseus and Circe; Agrius ruled over the Tyrrhenians, originally a somewhat vague term for the inhabitants of central Italy, which in later times was applied specifically to the Etruscans. This passage reveals Hellenic interest in the peoples of Italy dating to at least the eighth century BC. In this account, the Romans are descended from Odysseus, one of the Achaeans, rather than his contemporary, the Trojan prince Aeneas.Hesiod, Theogony, 1011-1016Erich S. Gruen, Cultural Fictions and Cultural Identity Writing in the fourth century BC, Heraclides Ponticus, a pupil of Plato, referred to Rome as a \\"Greek city\\".Plutarch, Camillus, 22.2 About the same time, Aristotle related a tradition that Achaean warriors returning home after the Trojan War were driven to Italy by a storm. Stranded on the Italian shores with a number of captive Trojan women, they built a settlement called \\"Latinium\\".Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Romaike Archaiologia, i. 72. The Etruscans were particularly interested in the myth of Aeneas and Anchises from at least the late sixth century BC.F. Bomer, Rom und Troia, Kunst und Wissenschaft, Baden-Baden (1951). Perhaps influenced by Hesiod, they originally considered the Greek Odysseus to be their founder-hero, but later embraced Aeneas as their founder due to their growing rivalry with the Greek city-states of Italy; increasingly they perceived the Greek colonists as their enemies, rather than partners in trade.A. Alfoldi, Early Rome and the Latins, Ann Arbor, University of Michigan Press (1971). Aeneas is depicted on a number of black-figure and red figure vases unearthed in southern Etruria, dating from the end of the sixth century to the middle of the fifth century BC.K. Schauenburg, \\"Aeneas und Rom\\", in Gymnasium, vol. 67, pp. 176‚Äì191 (1960). Beginning in the late seventh century BC, Roman culture was heavily influenced by the Etruscans. Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, the fifth king of Rome, and his grandson, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh and last king, were Etruscans, and it may have been during this period that the Etruscan interest in Aeneas was transmitted to Rome. Writing toward the end of the third century BC, Quintus Fabius Pictor, the father of Roman history, related the story that the Romans were descended from Aeneas, via his son Ascanius, the founder of Alba Longa. In his account of Roman origins, Pictor described a continuous history of Greek exports to Italy, including the landing of Heracles and the establishment of a colony on the Palatine Hill by the Arcadians under Evander, to whom he attributed the introduction of the alphabet. In the second century BC, Marcus Porcius Cato, better known as Cato the Elder, composed his own history of Roman origins, following the existing traditions relating to Aeneas and his descendants; but to Cato, the Aborigines were themselves Greeks, and Romulus received the Aeolic tongue from Evander.Marcus Porcius Cato, Origines, i. 19.Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Romaike Archaiologia, i. 11, 13. Later influence In the Iliad, the god Poseidon prophesied that the descendants of Aeneas (the Aeneadae), would survive the Trojan War and rule their people forever,Iliad XX 306-308 but also that the rule of the Aeneadae would never happen in Troy.Gregory Nagy Homer the Preclassic p.198 Virgil provided the imperial legacy of the Aeneadae by making Iulus the divine ancestor of Augustus in the Aeneid. From this divine connection the line of Aeneas stretched through Romulus, Augustus, and the Julio-Claudian emperors down to Nero.Marie Tammer The Last Descendant of Aeneas: The Habsburgs and the Mythic Image of the Emperor p.68-69 The Julii Plan of the forum of Augustus. In the northwest hemicycle, a statue of Aeneas (here labeled \\"Statue d'√ân√©e\\") is flanked by the kings of Alba Longa to the south and members of the gens Julia to the north. It was popular in the late Roman republic for the more distinguished families to claim divine origin, and it was believed that Iulus (Ascanius) was the mythical ancestor of the gens Julia.Fitzgerald (translator) Aeneid 1983 6.1058-1067Sir William Smith (Editor) A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology vol. II 1882 p. 642 A notable member of the family, Julius Caesar, is said to have gone to Mount Alba to preside over the Feriae Latinae,Bruce Lincoln Authority: Construction and Corrosion p.41 Latin rites originally celebrated by the kings of Alba Longa. This confused many Romans, who hailed him as king upon his return to Rome.Suetonius Life of Julius Caesar 79.2 Mindful of the Republic's ancient traditions, including one by which any person claiming to be King of Rome was to be put to death, he rejected this honour. In the Forum of Augustus, statues of the kings of Alba Longa and members of the Julian family were placed with AeneasOvid Fasti V.563 in the northwest hemicycle. In that hemicycle were the statues of Aeneas,Elogium of Aeneas () the kings of Alba Longa,Elogia of some of the kings have been found: , , , , and and M. Claudius Marcellus, C. Julius Caesar Strabo, and Julius Caesar (the adoptive father of Augustus) among others.Evans, Jane DeRose The Art of Persuasion: Political Propaganda from Aeneas to Brutus p.112 The northeast hemicycle had summi viri placed with Romulus. Augustus' funerary procession reflects the same kind of propaganda as his \\"Hall of Heroes\\" and included many of the same statues, with one headed by Aeneas and the other by Romulus. In propagating his apotheosis, Augustus chose to include his adoptive father Julius Caesar who had recently achieved divinity himself, whereas Aeneas and Romulus are included for their divinity was well established.Evans, Jane DeRose The Art of Persuasion: Political Propaganda from Aeneas to Brutus p.113 Roman mythology Kings of Alba Longa would have claimed to be descendants of Jupiter as Virgil demonstrates in the Aeneid. He represents the Alban kings as being crowned with a civic oak-leaf crown.Virgil Aeneid VI. 772 The Roman kings then adopted the crown, becoming personifications of Jupiter on earth.James George Frazer The Golden Bough chapter XIII Latinus was thought to have become Jupiter LatiarisArthur Bernard Cook The European Sky-God III. The Italians after \\"vanishing\\" during a battle with Mezentius (king of Caere). So too, Aeneas disappeared from a battle with Mezentius or with Turnus, and became Jupiter Indiges.Livy I. 2, 6 and Pliny Natural History 3. 56An elogium at Pompeii in which Aeneas has the title Indiges Pater (). Romulus (not unlike his Alban predecessors) became Quirinus, the \\"Oak-god\\", when he was called up to heaven. Medieval Europe Geoffrey of Monmouth, a Benedictine monk living in the 12th century AD, wrote a fabricated history of the kings of Britain (Historia Regum Britanniae). In this history Britain is said to receive its name from Brutus, the first of its kings. According to him, Brutus was the son of Silvius and the grandson of Aeneas. While on a hunting trip with his father he accidentally shoots him and so flees Italy. First, Brutus goes to Greece and gathers Trojan companions who join him on his journey to Britain, where he takes the island from a race of giants.Charles Selby Events to be Remembered in the History of Britain p.1-2 Beno√Æt de Saint-Maure names Charlemagne as a descendant of the mythical Francus, thus linking the Plantagenet family to Aeneas.David Coward, A History of French Literature (Blackwell, 2002), p.13. Francus, like Aeneas, survived the destruction of Troy and traveled to find a new home. He installed a territory with other Trojans comprising the entire Rhine and the Danube and founded a powerful village named Sicambri.Fredegar, Chronicle of Fredegar Historicity The ancient historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus is believed to have invented the Alban chronology to fill the gap of centuries between the fall of Troy and the founding of Rome. This could have been achieved by him taking the Roman history as it was, comparing it with the Greek, and inserting Greek Olympiads or Athenian archons.Thomas Henry Dyer The History of the Kings of Rome p. 75-76 This method would have made the Greek histories seem contemporary with the people and events in the Roman history of his time. The names of the kings are often based on places around Rome, such as Tiberinus, Aventinus, Alba, and Capetus. Others are rationalizations of mythical figures, or pure inventions to provide notable ancestors for status-seeking families. In the Aeneid, Virgil invents characters into living beings not unlike the heroes of Homer. The events described toward the end of the Aeneid were a nationalistic interpretation of perceived historical events in Roman history.Barthold Niebuhr The History of Rome, Volume 1 1871 p.193-194 However, despite being a later invention, the Silvian house or gens Silvia likely did exist.William Smith Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography 1854 In literature *In Dante's Paradiso, Canto VI, the soul of Eastern Roman Emperor Justinian I describes a brief history of the Romans to Dante. He begins with Aeneas arriving in Italy and avenging the death of Pallas (whom ancient writersVirgil Aeneid VIII credit for settling the Palatine hill of Rome). Justinian claims Alba Longa held the Imperial eagle for three centuries until its defeat by Rome following the duel between the three Horatii and the three Curiatii.Paradiso, Canto VI, lines 28-54 *In the Nuremberg Chronicle (Hartmann Schedel, 1493), the kings of Alba Longa are listed as according to Livy, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and Ovid. They are used in comparison to date the time in which various Biblical figures were alive.Hartmann Schedel The Nuremberg Chronicle Folio XLIX recto 1493 *In Historia regum Britanniae (Geoffrey of Monmouth), the reigns of several kings of Alba Longa are used to provide context for many Biblical events and the lifetimes of historical persons.Geoffrey of Monmouth History of the Kings of Britain This links the early kings of Britain to the House of Silvius.

On 14 November 2003, Alexander ALX400 bodied Dennis Trident 2s replaced the AEC Routemasters that had operated it since its inception. In January 2009, the route's peak frequency was reduced from twelve buses per hour to ten, as part of Transport for London's policy of reducing the number of buses using Oxford Street in order to reduce congestion and pollution by 10% in 2009 and a further 10% in 2010. See Appendix 1. The off-peak service already operated at this frequency. On 5 January 2009, a bus operating on the route crashed into a shop in Westbourne Grove after swerving to avoid a van, injuring ten people. Later in 2009, Transport for London decided not to proceed with a possible change of the eastbound route in the Elgin Crescent area, following a consultation with residents and local interest groups. The proposal would have routed the eastbound 23 along Ladbroke Gardens instead of Elgin Crescent, while routes 52 and 452 would continue to run along Elgin Crescent in both directions. The most common benefit stated amongst supporters was fewer buses along the overcrowded Elgin Crescent; those opposing the change were concerned about safety at the junction of Ladbroke Grove and Ladbroke Gardens, and the suitability of Ladbroke Gardens to accommodate a bus service.

Appearing in coniferous and deciduous woodland in summer and autumn, the stout fruit bodies are attractively coloured, with a beige to olive cap up to 15 cm (6 in) across, yellow pores, and a reddish stipe up to long and wide. The pale yellow flesh stains blue when broken or bruised. Christiaan Persoon first described Boletus calopus in 1801. Modern molecular phylogenetics showed that it was only distantly related to the type species of Boletus and required placement in a new genus; Caloboletus was erected in 2014, with C. calopus designated as the type species. Although Caloboletus calopus is not typically considered edible due to an intensely bitter taste that does not disappear with cooking, there are reports of it being consumed in eastern Europe. Its red stipe distinguishes it from edible species, such as Boletus edulis. Taxonomy Caloboletus calopus was originally published under the name Boletus olivaceus by Jacob Christian Sch√§ffer in 1774, but this name is unavailable for use as it was later sanctioned for another species. Johann Friedrich Gmelin's 1792 synonym Boletus lapidum is also illegitimate. Christiaan Hendrik Persoon described the mushroom in 1801; its specific name is derived from the Greek Œ∫Œ±ŒªŒøœÇ/kalos (\\"pretty\\") and œÄŒøœÖœÇ/pous (\\"foot\\"), referring to its brightly coloured stipe. The German name, Sch√∂nfu√ür√∂hrling or \\"pretty-foot bolete\\", is a literal translation. Alternate common names are scarlet-stemmed bolete and bitter beech bolete. Other synonyms include binomials resulting from generic transfers to Dictyopus by Lucien Qu√©let in 1886, and Tubiporus by Ren√© Maire in 1937. Boletus frustosus, originally published as a distinct species by Wally Snell and Esther Dick in 1941, was later described as a variety of B. calopus by Orson K. Miller and Roy Watling in 1968. Estad√®s and Lannoy described the variety ruforubraporus and the form ereticulatus from Europe in 2001. In his 1986 infrageneric classification of the genus Boletus, Rolf Singer placed C. calopus as the type species of the section Calopodes, which includes species characterised by having a whitish to yellowish flesh, bitter taste, and a blue staining reaction in the tube walls. Other species in section Calopodes include C. radicans, C. inedulis, B. peckii, and B. pallidus. Genetic analysis published in 2013 showed that C. calopus and many (but not all) red-pored boletes were part of a dupainii clade (named for Boletus (now Rubroboletus) dupainii), well-removed from the core group of the type species B. edulis and relatives within the Boletineae. This indicated it needed placement in a new genus. This took place in 2014, B. calopus was transferred to (and designated the type species of) the new genus Caloboletus by Italian mycologist Alfredo Vizzini. Description The yellowish pores turn blue when injured. Up to 15 cm (6 in) or rarely 20 cm (8 in) in diameter, the cap is beige to olive and initially almost globular before opening out to a hemispherical and then convex shape. The surface of the cap is smooth or has minute hairs, and sometimes develops cracks with age. The cap cuticle hangs over the cap margin. The pore surface is initially pale yellow before deepening to an olive-yellow in maturity, and quickly turns blue when it is injured. The pores, numbering one or two per millimetre, are circular when young but become more angular as the mushroom ages. The tubes are up to deep. The attractively coloured stipe is typically yellow above to pink-red below, with a straw-coloured network (reticulation) near the top or over the upper half; occasionally the entire stipe is reddish. It measures long by thick, and is either fairly equal in width throughout, or thicker towards the base. Sometimes, the reddish stipe colour of mature mushrooms or harvested specimens that are a few days old disappears completely, and is replaced with ochre- brown tones. The pale yellow flesh stains blue when broken, the discolouration spreading out from the damaged area. Its smell can be strong, and has been likened to ink. The spore print is olive to olive-brown. Spores are smooth and elliptical, measuring 13‚Äì19 by 5‚Äì6 ¬µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 30‚Äì38 by 9‚Äì12 ¬µm. The cystidia are club- shaped to spindle-shaped, hyaline, and measure 25‚Äì40 by 10‚Äì15 ¬µm. Variety frustosus is morphologically similar to the main type, but its cap becomes areolate (marked out into small areas by cracks and crevices) in maturity. Its spores are slightly smaller too, measuring 11‚Äì15 by 4‚Äì5.5 ¬µm. In the European form ereticulatus, the reticulations on the upper stipe are replaced with fine reddish granules, while the variety ruforubraporus has pinkish-red pores. Similar species The overall colouration of Caloboletus calopus, with its pale cap, yellow pores and red stipe, is not shared with any other bolete. Large pale specimens resemble Suillellus luridus, and the cap of Rubroboletus satanas is a similar colour but this species has red pores. Fruit bodies in poor condition could be confused with Xerocomellus chrysenteron but the stipes of this species are not reticulated. Edible species such as B. edulis lack a red stipe. It closely resembles the similarly inedible C. radicans, which lacks the redness on the stipe. Like C. calopus, the western North American species C. rubripes also has a bitter taste, similarly coloured cap, and yellowish pores that bruise blue, but it lacks reticulation on its reddish stipe. Found in northwestern North America, B. coniferarum lacks reddish or pinkish colouration in its yellow reticulate stipe, and has a darker, olive- grey to deep brown cap. Two eastern North American species, C. inedulis and C. roseipes, also have an appearance similar to C. calopus. C. inedulis produces smaller fruit bodies with a white to greyish-white cap, while C. roseipes associates solely with hemlock. C. firmus, found in the eastern United States, eastern Canada, and Costa Rica, has a pallid cap colour, reddish stipe, and bitter taste, but unlike C. calopus, has red pores and lacks stipe reticulation. C. panniformis, a Japanese species described as new to science in 2013, bears a resemblance to C. calopus, but can be distinguished by its rough cap surface, or microscopically by the amyloid-staining cells in the flesh of the cap, and morphologically distinct cystidia on the stipe. Distribution and habitat An ectomycorrhizal species, Caloboletus calopus grows in coniferous and deciduous woodland, often at higher altitudes, especially under beech and oak. Fruit bodies occur singly or in large groups. The species grows on chalky ground from July to December, in Northern Europe, and North America's Pacific Northwest and Michigan. In North America, its range extends south to Mexico. Variety frustosus is known from California and the Rocky Mountains of Idaho. In 1968, after comparing European and North American collections, Miller and Watling suggested that the typical form of C. calopus does not occur in the United States. Similar comparisons by other authors have led them to the opposite conclusion, and the species has since been included in several North American field guides. The bolete has been recorded from the Black Sea region in Turkey, from under Populus ciliata and Abies pindrow in Rawalpindi and Nathia Gali in Pakistan, Yunnan Province in China, Korea, and Taiwan. Biochemistry Structure of calopin. Although it is an attractive-looking bolete, Caloboletus calopus is not considered edible on account of its very bitter taste, which does not disappear upon cooking. There are reports of it being eaten in far eastern Russia and Ukraine. The bitter taste is largely due to the compounds calopin and a Œ¥-lactone derivative, O-acetylcyclocalopin A. These compounds contains a structural motif known as a 3-methylcatechol unit, which is rare in natural products. A total synthesis of calopin was reported in 2003. The pulvinic acid derivatives atromentic acid, variegatic acid, and xerocomic acid are present in B. calopus mushrooms. These compounds inhibit cytochrome P450‚Äîmajor enzymes involved in drug metabolism and bioactivation. Other compounds found in the fruit bodies include calopin B, and the sesquiterpenoid compounds cyclopinol and boletunones A and B. The latter two highly oxygenated compounds have significant free-radical scavenging activity in vitro. The compounds 3-octanone (47.0% of total volatile compounds), 3-octanol (27.0%), 1-octen-3-ol (15.0%), and limonene (3.6%) are the predominant volatile components that give the fruit body its odour.

Haynes established his flute-making shop, Wm S Haynes Co., in Piedmont Street in the Bay Village district of Boston, where the business was until moving to Acton, MA in 2010.

Johnston was nicknamed \\"Blue\\" in typical Australian fashion due to his red hair. Johnston played when the Glenelg club (formed in 1920) was still very much struggling to be competitive against the other seven, more established, sides in the League. Indeed, apart from the 1934 premiership, the highest the club finished during Johnston's playing career was sixth. Johnston played 203 league games (the first Glenelg player to pass the 200 mark) during his career, won three best and fairest awards, and put in a best afield performance as the club broke its premiership duck against Port Adelaide in 1934. He also won the SANFL's highest individual honour ‚Äì the Magarey Medal for the best and fairest player ‚Äì in 1934. Jeff Pash, himself a Magarey Medallist in 1939, described Johnston as \\"a phenomenal leaper for the ball ... he had the sort of (frightening) steel-spring strength about him that John Coleman had.

History On April 29, 1941, the station signed on the air.Broadcasting Yearbook 1942 page 160 It was Watertown's second radio station, after 1240 WATN went on the air only three months earlier. The call sign was originally WWNY and it broadcast at 500 watts on 1300 kilocycles. It was owned by the Brockway Company which also owned the Watertown Daily Times newspaper. WWNY had its studios in the Hotel Woodruff at 49 Public Square. WWNY got a construction permit from the Federal Communications Commission to move to 790 kHz. That was coupled with a power increase to 1,000 watts, giving the station increased coverage. WWNY was a network affiliate of CBS Radio, carrying its dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts during the \\"Golden Age of Radio.\\" In 1947, an FM station was added, WWNY-FM at 100.3 MHz.Broadcasting Yearbook 1950 page 222 The FM station largely simulcast the programs on the AM station. Few people owned FM radios in the 1940s. Management saw little chance to make it profitable, so WWNY-FM was taken off the air in the 1950s and the license turned in to the FCC. WWNY added a TV station in 1954, Channel 7 WCNY-TV.Broadcasting Yearbook 1955 page 222 Because the TV station is licensed to Carthage, New York, outside Watertown, the two stations did not have the same call sign. When the FCC relaxed the rules, the TV station switched to WWNY-TV. (The WCNY-TV call letters are now used on a PBS television station in Syracuse, New York.) In 1981, the TV station was sold to United Communications. WWNY-TV got to keep its call letters, so AM 790 slightly changed its call sign to WTNY. Through the 1960s, 70s and 80s, WTNY had a middle of the road format of popular adult music, news, sports and talk. But in the 1990s, listeners switched from AM to FM for music. So WTNY added more talk shows and eventually went with an all- talk format. It remained a CBS Radio affiliate for world and national news coverage.

Its main products were military gliders and light transport aircraft. History GAL.42 Cygnet II G-AGAX, March 1955 On 27 February 1931, General Aircraft Limited (GAL) was formed to undertake production of aircraft using the 'monospar' wing designs of the Mono-spar Company Ltd. Both firms were headed by Helmut J. Stieger, the Swiss inventor of the technique. GAL produced about 28 examples of the Monospar series of twin-engined light transport aircraft at Croydon Aerodrome between 1932 and 1934. In October 1934, both companies were re-capitalised by investment group British Pacific Trust, and were re-formed in a new company also named General Aircraft Limited. Also included in the new company were the assets of National Flying Services Ltd, the owner of London Air Park, plus adjoining industrial premises built in 1917 by Whitehead Aircraft Ltd. In early 1935, the Crystal Croydon production facilities were transferred to the Hanworth site, near Feltham. Production then restarted with the Monospar ST-12, Monospar ST-18, and Monospar ST-25.Jackson (1974)Smith (2002)Sherwood (1999)London Gazette (1934) In 1936, GAL received an order to build 89 Hawker Fury IIs; this was followed by other sub-contract work including the conversion of 125 Hawker Hinds into trainers. In 1938, the company bought the design of the Cygnet light aircraft from the foundering C.W. Aircraft Ltd and it was further developed as the GAL.42 Cygnet II. GAL also operated an RAF flying training school at Fairoaks aerodrome, Surrey. During World War II, GAL became an important designer and manufacturer of gliders. It was part of the Civilian Repair Organisation, to repair Supermarine Spitfires at Hanworth, and Beaufighters at Fairoaks. It also modified Hawker Hurricanes to enable catapult-launching from convoy escort ships. In 1943 Sikorsky helicopters were imported from the US for experimental work. Supplied in crates, they were assembled and flown at Hanworth Aerodrome ‚Äì one squadron for the RAF, and two squadrons for the Fleet Air Arm. Major overhauls were carried out at Hanworth on the helicopters, plus experimental work in Air Sea Rescue, limited by the weight-lifting capacity of the helicopters. After World War II, GAL diversified into the construction of pre-fabricated houses and car bodies. The company had designed and built a large transport aircraft, the GAL.60 Universal. However, GAL realised it did not have the room or capacity to produce the aircraft in quantity, and approached Blackburn Aircraft Ltd, that was looking for work to keep its factory at Brough Aerodrome busy. On 1 January 1949, this led to the two companies merging to form the Blackburn and General Aircraft Ltd.

Slavophiles were especially opposed to the influences of Western Europe in Russia.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Slavophile article There were also similar movements in Poland, Hungary and Greece.  Prominent Slavophiles  *Ivan Sergeyevich Aksakov (Russian: –ò–≤–∞–Ω –°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–µ–≤–∏—á –ê–∫—Å–∞–∫–æ–≤; - , Moscow) was a Russian litt√©rateur and notable Slavophile. He was the son of Sergey Aksakov and brother to Vera Aksakova and Konstantin Aksakov. He was born in what is now Bashkortostan. *Konstantin Sergeyevich Aksakov () (1817‚Äì1860) was a Russian critic and writer, one of the earliest and most notable Slavophiles. He wrote plays, social criticism, and histories of the ancient Russian social order.Russia and Western Civilization: Cultural and Historical Encounters By Russell Bova His father Sergey Aksakov and sister Vera Aksakova were writers, and his younger brother Ivan Aksakov was a journalist. *Aleksey Stepanovich Khomyakov (–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–π –°—Ç–µ–ø–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á –•–æ–º—è–∫–æ–≤) (May 1, 1804, Moscow ‚Äì September 23/25, 1860) was a Russian religious poet who co-founded the Slavophile movement along with Ivan Kireevsky, and became one of its most distinguished theoreticians. *Ivan Vasilyevich Kireyevsky (; 3 April 1806, Moscow ‚Äî 23 June 1856) was a Russian literary critic and philosopher who, together with Aleksey Khomyakov, co-founded the Slavophile movement. *Mikhail Petrovich Pogodin (, 1800, Moscow - 1875) was a Russian historian and journalist who dominated the national historiography between the death of Nikolay Karamzin in 1826 and the rise of Sergey Solovyov in the 1850s. He is best remembered as a staunch proponent of the Normanist theory of Russian statehood. In 1841 Pogodin joined his old friend Stepan Shevyrev in editing Moskovityanin, a periodical which came to voice the Slavophile opinions. In the course of the following fifteen years of editing, Pogodin and Shevyrev steadily slid towards the most reactionary form of Slavophilism. *Yuri Samarin (–Æ—Ä–∏–π –§—ë–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á –°–∞–º–∞—Ä–∏–Ω; 1819-1876) was a leading Russian Slavophile thinker and one of the architects of the Emancipation reform of 1861. *Fyodor Ivanovich Tyutchev (Russian: –§—ë–¥–æ—Ä –ò–≤–∞ÃÅ–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á –¢—éÃÅ—Ç—á–µ–≤; - ) is generally considered the last of three great Romantic poets of Russia, following Alexander Pushkin and Mikhail Lermontov. Politically, he was a militant Slavophile, who never needed a particular reason to berate the Western powers, Vatican, Ottoman Empire, or Poland, perceived by him as Judas of pan-Slavic interests. The failure of the Crimean War made him look critically at the Russian government. *Nikolay Mikhailovich Yazykov (, March 4, 1803, Simbirsk - December 26, 1846, Moscow) was a Russian poet and Slavophile who in the 1820s rivalled Alexander Pushkin and Yevgeny Baratynsky as the most popular poet of his generation.

Up until 1858 when Ecclesiastical courts were abolished, ecclesiastical judges tried church clergy men in church courts or Ecclesiastical courts. Charges dealt in these courts were often very lenient, especially when dealt to church clergymen. Catholic canon law The official body appointed by the qualified ecclesiastical authority for the administration of justice is called a court () Every such court consists at the least of two sworn officials: the judge who gives the decision, and the clerk of the court (), whose duty is to keep a record of the proceedings and the decision.(c. xi, X, De probat., II, xix) As a rule, however, an ecclesiastical court forms a collegiate tribunal, the members of which either join with the presiding officer in giving the decision as judges () or merely advise with him as councillors () (cc. xvi, xxi, xxii, xxiii, X, De off. et pot. jud. deleg., I, xxix). Connected with the courts are advocates, procurators, syndics, defenders, promoters, conservators, apparitors, messengers etc. The procurators and advocates conduct the case as the representatives or defenders of the parties to the suit;(X, De postul., I, xxxvii; X, De procurat., I, xxxviii) the syndic is the counsel of a juridical person, a collegiate body or a chapter.(X, De syndic., I, xxxix) The chief duty of the conservators is to represent the rights of the , i.e. members of orders, the poor, widows, orphans.(c. xv, in VIto, De off. et pot. jud. deleg., I, xiv) The fiscal promoter () is appointed by the ecclesiastical authorities to watch over ecclesiastical discipline,(Instructio Congr. Ep. et Reg., 11 June 1880, art. xiii) consequently in penal cases he appears as public prosecutor. A , or defender of the matrimonial tie, assists in suits concerning the invalidity of a marriage.(Benedict XIV, , 3 November 1741) In addition to his jurisdiction, which can be ordinary, quasi-ordinary or delegated, the ecclesiastical judge must also have certain physical and moral qualities. It is further necessary to have full use of his senses and understanding, and suitable legal knowledge; the person appointed must also be twenty years old; but eighteen years will suffice for a judge appointed by the pope or if the parties agree to it.(c. xli, X, De off. jud. deleg., I, xxix) The judge must also have a good reputation, must not be excommunicated, suspended from office, or under an interdict(c. xxiv, X, De sent. et re jud., II, xxvii) Above all he must be impartial; a suspicion of partiality attaches to the judge who is personally interested in a case,(c. xxxvi, X, De appellat., II, xxviii) or is related by blood within the fourth degree to one of the parties, or connected with one by marriage,(c. xxxvi, cit.) or who lives in the same house, or dines at a common table, or is otherwise friendly, or on the other hand inimical, towards one of the parties,(c. xxv, X, De off. jud. deleg., I, xxix) and he may be rejected () by the accused or by both parties as prejudiced () If objection be raised against a judge on the ground of prejudice, which must be done in writing and if possible before the beginning of the action,(c. xx, X, De sent. et re jud., II, xxvii) arbitrators are to pass on the objection;(c. xxxix, X, De off. jud. deleg., I, xxix) if, however, objection be raised against the delegate of the bishop, the decision rests with the bishop.(c. iv, X, De foro compet., II, ii) If the objection be declared well-founded, the judge transfers the case, with the concurrence of the party who brought the accusation, to another or to a higher judge.(c. lxi, X, De appell., II, xxviii) If the judge lacks the necessary qualifications, and this be known to the parties in the suit, the decision is invalid; if, however, his unfitness be unknown to the parties, and he follow statute canon law, the Church supplements the deficiency, even if the judge have acted in bad faith. Ecclesiastical jurisdiction is exercised over all baptized persons; yet in order that an ecclesiastical judge may be permitted to exercise his judicial power he must also be competent, i.e. must be authorized to pass judgment on a given person in a given case Proceedings held before a judge without competence are null and void. Those subject to the jurisdiction of a certain judge are said to be within the competence () of his court, or have their in him. The forum is either the free, voluntary choice of the parties (), or it is defined by law (), but in criminal and matrimonial cases there is no .(c. ix, X, De in integr. restit., I, xli) Ecclesiastics can choose another judge only with the permission of the bishop, and in this case he must be an ecclesiastic(c. xii, xviii, X, De foro compet., II, ii) The legal forum () is either ordinary, if the proper course of the regular courts is followed, or extraordinary, if for legal reasons a regular court is passed over. Moreover, the is either general (), corresponding to the universally valid law, or special or privileged (), resting on privilege, as in the case of ecclesiastics on account of the which they cannot renounce. As the jurisdiction of a judge is generally limited to a defined locality, the is fixed by the or of the accused. The axiom holds: , the plaintiff goes to the court of the accused.() Domicile is that place where one actually resides with the intention of always remaining there Quasi-domicile is determined by actual residence at the place and the intention to remain there at least the greater part of the year; there is also a domicile by operation of law, legal or fictitious domicile ()‚Äîthus a wife may be subject to the jurisdiction of the domicile of the husband, children to that of the parents, religious to that of the place where the monastery is situated, persons having no fixed abode to that of the present place of residence A process can be instituted at Rome against an ecclesiastic who is only accidentally there.(c. xx, X, De foro compet., II, ii) Besides the‚Äîusual‚Äî, there is also that of the object (, where the thing is situated), i.e. complaint can be brought before the judge in whose district the controverted object is;(c. iii, X, De foro compet., II, ii) the forum where the contract is made (), i.e. the parties can bring action before the judge in whose district the disputed contract has been made;() that of the offence (), within the jurisdiction where the offence was committed.() There is also a forum arising from the connection of matters (), if the matters in dispute are so interrelated that one cannot be decided without the other;() also the forum of a counterplea (), i.e. in a criminal suit the defendant can, on his side, accuse the plaintiff in the court of the judge before whom he himself is to be tried.() If the judge himself wishes to bring an accusation, the superior appoints the judge who is to hear it.(c. i, c. xvi, Q. vi) The decision of an incompetent judge is valid if by common error () he is held to be competent In civil disputes the parties can entrust the decision to any desired arbiter.() If the judge render a defective decision, appeal can be taken to the next higher judge; this relation of the courts to one another and the successive course of appeals (), called succession of instances, follows the order of superiority. From the beginning the bishop, or his representative, the archdeacon, or the \\"official\\" (), or the vicar- general, was the judge in first instance for all suits, contentious or criminal, which arose in the diocese or in the corresponding administrative district, so far as such suits were not withdrawn from his jurisdiction by the common law. The court of second instance was originally the provincial synod, later the metropolitan.[c. iii (Syn. of Nicaea, an. 325, c. v), iv (Syn. of Antioch, an. 341, c. xx), D. XVIII] The court of the third instance was that of the pope. The court of the first instance for bishops was the provincial synod, the metropolitan, the exarch or the patriarch; the court of second instance was that of the pope;[c. xxxvi (Syn. of Sardica, an. 343, c. vii), c. II, Q. vi] only the pope could be the judge of first instance for exarchs and patriarchs. Since the Middle Ages the pope is the judge of first instance in all more important episcopal causes (), the number and extent of which are in no way exactly definable, but to which above all belong the ‚Äîmore serious criminal charges against bishops() Conformably to this the diocesan bishop or his representative (the vicar-general, or , or some other diocesan authority) became the judge of the court of first instance, so far as common law has not withdrawn from him this jurisdiction.(Council of Trent, Sess. XXIV, De ref., c. xx) If the see is vacant the vicar-capitular is judge of the court of first instance. The judge of the second instance is the metropolitan.(c. lxvi, X, De appell., II, xxviii) For archdioceses, as a rule, the judge of second instance is a neighbouring archbishop or bishop appointed by the Holy See.(Concil. plenar. Baltimor., III, an. 1884, n. 316; Leo XIII, , 18 April 1897, n. 14) The same ordinance also applies to exempt bishoprics.(Sacr. Congr. pro negot. eccles. extraord., 11 September 1906) The court of the third instance is the Apostolic See, but in the it is the court of first instance As, however, the pope is the , the ordinary ecclesiastical judge of all, ecclesiastical suits without exception can be brought or summoned before the as the court of first instance.(Council of Trent, Sess. XXIV, De ref., c. xx; Vatic., Sess. III, De eccl., c. iii) In the Middle Ages the lower courts were often evaded, or the popes summoned the suits at one before their forum;(c. lci, X, De appell., II, xxviii) this custom had some advantages on account of the better legal education and greater impartiality of the members of the papal court, but the administration of justice was delayed and, above all, made more costly by the rule enforced in the papal courts that the parties must appear in person. What made the matter still worse was that such summonses to Rome, as to the court of first instance, diminish unduly the authority of the lower courts. To put an end, therefore, to constant complaint on this point, the Decretals(q. v.) ordained that in future, before the rendering of the sentence, no one could appeal to a higher court without giving a sufficient reason to the judge (from whom the appeal was made), and that the appeal could only be accepted by the judge (to whom appeal lies) after he had satisfied himself of the validity of the appeal(c. lvi, X, De appell., II, xxviii) Lawsuits, therefore, pending before the Apostolic See were to be tried by a judge belonging to the place whence the appeal came, and especially appointed by the pope.(c. xxviii, X, De rescript., I, iii; c. xi, in Vito, De rescript., I, iii) In the late Middle Ages rulers of countries were frequently granted for their domains the papal (exemption from summons); in some cases, they forbade the appeal to a foreign court. Following the precedents of the Synod of Constance(Martini V Pap. et Germ. nat. concordata, c. iv, in Hardouin, \\"Acta. Conc.\\", VIII, 891) and Synod of Basle,(Sess. XXXI, c. i, in Hardouin, \\"Acta. Conc.\\", VIII, 1425) the Council of Trent(Sess. XXIV, De ref., c. xx, and Sess. XXV, De ref., c. x) decreed: The court of the bishop is the court of first instance Each suit must be brought to a close within at least two years. During this period no appeal is permitted, neither can the higher judge summon the case before his forum; an appeal before the lapse of two years is permissible only if a final sentence has been pronounced. In case of appeal to the Apostolic See, or if the latter, for good reasons, summons a suit from the beginning before its forum, the suit is to be decided either at Rome or by delegated judges on the spot (). As on account of the remoteness of the place where the dispute arose and the consequent lack of knowledge of local persons, unsuitable judges have been at times appointed at the place where the dispute arose, the bishops are each to select, on occasion of the provincial‚Äîor diocesan synod, at least four men () having the qualities designated by Boniface VIII,(c. xi, in VIto, De rescript., I, iii) and present their names to the Apostolic See, which in its selection of judges is to be so limited to the persons thus named that the delegation of any other person is invalid; as provincial and diocesan synods are no longer regularly held, bishops are permitted to make this selection with the advice of the diocesan chapter;(Benedict XIV, , 26 August 1741) consequently, judges so appointed are called . At present, this also is no longer customary: on the contrary, the Apostolic See appoints its representatives entirely independently, but it is so arranged that the delegation is bestowed on neighbor bishops and archbishops for a definite term of years. Such delegation is all the more necessary in case a State does not permit ecclesiastical suits to be tried outside of its boundaries, or will only permit the judgement of such a court to be executed within its territories by the secular power.

He was an architect and astrologer and was used by the German military in the Third Reich, not necessarily willingly. Two of the more well-known mystics, other than Straniak, used in the Third Reich by Walter Schellenberg through Heinrich Himmler, who had a great deal of interest in Germanic mysticism and revivalism, were Wilhelm Gutberlet, who was a pendulum dowser, and astrologer Wilhelm Wulff. Dowsing Straniak claimed to have a special gift for map pendulum dowsing. Straniak would dangle a pendulum over a given map and \\"locate\\" things. As a test, leaders of the German Navy requested him to locate the pocket battleship Prinz Eugen, then at sea. The Navy provided him with charts and were reportedly amazed that he had pinpointed the warship even though it was on a completely secret mission off the coast of Norway. This impressed the Navy leaders enough to take the workings of the occult unit of the SS more seriously. This also inspired the character \\"Captain Jack Sparrow\\" in 'Pirates of the Caribbean'. According to Karl Spiesberger in his book Reveal the Power of the Pendulum, Straniak believed that brass was the most suitable material for all kinds of dowsing and that even fruits such as apples, oranges, pears and lemons demonstrate a polarity at each end.

The series is produced by Young Pei-pei and starred Julian Cheung, Ruby Lin and Dong Jie. Plot Li Huai is the illegitimate son of Li Manqing, an influential government official who is also well versed in martial arts. His grandfather, Li Xunhuan, was a highly revered martial artist who rose to fame for his signature dagger-throwing technique, the \\"Little Li Flying Dagger\\". Li Huai has never met his father before because he was raised far away from home by his mother, who died when he was still a child. He leads the life of a roaming street urchin with his two best friends, Zhao Chuan and Zhang Zhen. Li Huai eventually meets his father and his family in town, but their reunion is an unhappy one. Li has never been properly educated since he was a child so he behaves in a rough and uncouth manner. His stepbrother and stepmother, who already despise him for his background, find his behaviour disgraceful to their family. Faced with constant prejudice and bullying from his stepbrother and stepmother, Li has no choice but to flee from home. Before he leaves, his father passes him the manual of the \\"Little Li Flying Dagger\\" and tells him to practise the skill on his own. His mother left him with an embroidered purse containing a treasure map before she died. Li finds the treasure and roams the jianghu to help the poor with his wealth and use his newly mastered martial arts to uphold justice. Throughout his adventures, Li gets entangled in romantic relationships with two maidens. The first, Xue Caiyue, is an enemy of his family because his father killed her father, Xue Qingbi, in a duel several years ago. The second, Fang Keke, is indebted to him and has a crush on him because he changed her life from that of a beggar to a rich girl. At the same time, Li's two childhood friends also play significant roles in shaping his path: Zhao Chuan is kind and compassionate towards him, but he is secretly in love with Fang Keke; Zhang Zhen is scheming and ungrateful, and he exploits Li to achieve his goal of becoming the richest man in town.

He founded the influential Anjuman-e-Sharie organization. Early life Yousuf was born in Budgam in 1322 Hijri. He completed his education in Islamic law from Najaf in Iraq. He is a descendant of Mir Shamsuddin Araki, who came to Kashmir in the 13th century from the town of Araki in Iran. After the death of his elder brother Aga Syed Ahmed Almosavi, he took over the responsibilities of the Aga family. He established an educational institution for Islamic learning called Madras-e Babul Ilem (\\"gateway of knowledge\\") in Budgam. Madars-e Babul Ilem is the Alma mater of many in the Kashmir literary field. It is the practice among Shias of Kashmir to go to their religious head (Mawlawi or Agas) for legal disputes instead of to government courts. Such Sharie Adalats (\\"religious courts\\") determine justice according to Islamic doctrine. During the period of Aga Yousef, Sharie Adalats became very popular. On a number of occasions the district court sent cases to Yousef's court. During the reign of Maharaja Gulab Singh, Pratab Singh, and Hari Singh, an article was included in the constitution of Kashmir which bestowed this Aga family with a unique honour. According to the article, if any one from the Aga family was required to give testimony in any case then he would not go to the court instead the court would come to his residence and record the testimony. No one from the Aga family should be summoned in the court. The law existed up to the period of Aga Syed Yousuf.  Career  Anjumane Sharie Shian Aga Syed Yousef established Anjumane Sharie Shian in Jammu and Kashmir with both religious and political goals. Just as the government receives taxes from the general public, Anjuman Sharie Shian collects khums and fitr as alms from the Shia population to spend on social, educational and economic improvement for the poorer segment of the community. When Sheikh Abdullah's government passed the Land Reform Act, Aga Syed Yousef said the bill was against the doctrine of Shiaism, which resulted in the government exempting Shias from the bill.Valley of Kashmir Book Other accomplishments Yousuf undertook the construction of Imambara Budgam. He widened the Imambara Hassanabad, a smaller replica of the one in Budgam. Yousef also introduced the Shia nisab (\\"syllabus\\") at the University of Kashmir. Personal life Yousuf died on 29 August 1982. After his death, the district hospital of Budgam was named after him. Yousuf was buried in Budgam at the AgaMehdi shrine. The shrine was constructed by Yousuf himself during his lifetime to honor Sarkar Aga Syed Mehdi, who was also Yousuf's grandfather. His son was Aga Syed Mohammad Fazlullah who died on 29 January 2018 in Budgam.
