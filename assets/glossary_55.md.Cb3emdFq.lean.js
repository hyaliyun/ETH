A member of the ethnic Arameanhttps://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article13422332/Christ-koennte-ins- tuerkische-Parlament-einziehen.html minority in Turkey, he is a well-known advocate for minority rights, particularly the human rights situation of Turkey's Christian minorities. In the 2011 general election Dora became the first ethnic Aramean member of the Turkish Parliament, and the first Christian MP since 1960. Since 2014 a member of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), he was reelected in the consecutive June and November 2015 elections.  Early life and education  Dora was born 1964 to Enver and Kespu Dora, a Syriac Orthodox family in the small, all-Christian village of Hassana, easternmost settlement of the Tur Abdin. This ethnically diverse region near the border triangle with Syria and Iraq is the traditional home of the Syriac Orthodox community in Turkey, which speaks a variety of the Aramaic language. In the 1980s and 1990s, almost all of them however fled to Istanbul or Western Europe, after the Turkish military forcibly \\"evacuated\\" and effectively depopulated thousands of villages. Hassana, where Dora spent his early childhood, was one of these villages abandoned in the 1990s. Aged nine, Dora moved to Istanbul, where he attended the Armenian boarding school and orphanage Kamp Armen. Following his studies of law at Ankara University, he was drafted to attend his military service in Malatya, but was released early after paying the Bedelli askerlik.  Professional and political career  Following his studies, Dora returned to Istanbul practising as a lawyer, often defending Christians in trials. In 2004, he became a founding member and vice president of the first civic association of Assyrians/Syriacs since the 1980 military coup, the Mesopotamia Culture and Solidarity Association (Mezopotamya K√ºlt√ºr ve Dayanƒ±≈üma Derneƒüi, or MEZODER). In the 2011 general election, Dora became an independent candidate for the Labour, Democracy and Freedom Bloc. He was elected in the Mardin constituency to become the first Aramean member of the Grand National Assembly ever, and the first Christian MP since 1960. Though affiliated with the pro-minority Peace and Democracy Party (BDP), he told the Vatican Insider that he joined Parliament \\"as a free man\\" and wouldn't answer to any party. In late 2013, Dora however became one of the forerunner MPs to support the formation of the new Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), which he later joined. He was reelected in the consecutive June and November elections of 2015. In November 2015, Dora and Mithat Sancar joined fellow MPs G√ºlser Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m and Ali Atalan in their hunger strike to protest the ongoing state of exception curfew in the border town of Nusaybin, where since November 13 and under the pretext of operating against militant YDG-H members, 70% of the neighborhoods have been cut from electricity, 30% from water supply.  Positions  =State expropriation of Christian minorities= In the long-standing dispute on the Turkish state's confiscation of Aramean property, Dora, along with various Aramean diaspora organizations, demands a reversal of the expropriations and a return to the status quo ante. In June 2014, Dora sponsored a parliamentary motion demanding a parliamentary inquiry into the issue, which is also controversial within the Kurdish communities. Stating that there was still \\"no rule of law in the region, only the rule of force,\\" he proposed a scholarly commission to settle the land- claims of Syriac and Yezidi minorities. Most of them had emigrated when during the late 1980s \\"low-density war\\" thousands of Kurdish and Aramean villages were forcibly \\"evacuated\\" and effectively depopulated, leaving the villagers as refugees in their own land. =Current situation of Christian minorities= During the PKK's unilateral cease-fire, Dora appreciated what in 2003 he called an \\"atmosphere of peace\\" that had played a significant role in encouraging Arameans to consider a return to their Southern Anatolian homeland. In 2011, Dora still said: \\"Europe has the impression that Turkey is moving towards Islam and that it is a country that is becoming less secular. But as far as I am concerned, there isn't much of a difference between the past and the present, the situation is more or less the same and one of the things that has changed for the better is in fact the situation for Christians.\\" In the issue of history school books denigrating Armenians and Syriac Christians, Dora however acknowledged that hostile phrasings appeared there only relatively recently. The textbooks were found to distort historical information portraiting the Christian minorities as traitors, supposedly to help justify the genocides against Christians in the outgoing Ottoman Empire. To discuss the issue originally raised by fourteen Syriac civil and religious organizations, Dora met education minister √ñmer Din√ßer on 15 December 2011 and raised the issue in parliament. Eventually the ministry promised the revision of a particularly problematic textbook, which however turned into the opposite, as the revised version of the textbook doesn't only portray Arameans as traitors in the past, but now also claims that even today's Arameans continued their betrayal of Turkey. Lately, Dora supported the ‚Äì ultimately successful ‚Äì months of protest against destruction of the historic Armenian community property Kamp Armen in Istanbul, where he himself was once raised and educated. Visiting the site in May 2015, he stated that \\"Kamp Armen will be a significant symbol that provides an answer to that question.\\" Regarding the mass exodus of Christians from Iraq, Dora asked the United Nations and the USA to \\"intervene to defend them but without creating a civil conflict.\\"  Personal life  Dora is married and father of three children. Apart from his Aramaic native language, he speaks Turkish, Kurdish, Armenian and English.

That doesn't stop Enn from falling madly in love with Zan, a beautiful and rebellious alien who becomes fascinated with him.

David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter stated that despite the charming characters of Elle Fanning (a curious alien) and Nicole Kidman (a nihilistic low priestess), its attempts to \\"add political substance feels less than half-cooked\\" and in effect sacrifices \\"narrative cohesion\\" and \\"overcomplicates\\" Neil Gaiman's 18-page story.

His name is associated with his home Shoemaker's House, and shop Ellery's Arcade. He was one of the Toodyay‚Äôs civic leaders sitting on a number of boards and committees. Early life Charles George Ellery was born in Perth on 6 June 1854 to William Charles and Sophia (n√©e Dent), reputed to be the first female baby to be born to a settler in the Swan River Colony. Charles‚Äô father William Charles Ellery was an American sailor who jumped ship at Fremantle. He married Sophia in 1847 and the couple had five boys, William, James, Charles George, Frederick, and Andrew, and a girl Amy Ann. The father obtained work as an engineer working on steamboats on the Swan River, but died in February 1860 after being scalded when the Lady Stirling exploded. The public took pity on the young widow and raised funds for the family through a subscription. Toodyay The following year Sophia married William Mitchell and soon after this the family moved to Toodyay where Sophia gave birth to three more children. Charles George Emery was eight years of age when they arrived. As a youth Charles worked as a sawyer, then in 1872 when he was about 18 years of age he started his own business as a bootmaker, a profession he followed for the rest of his life.Obituary, Toodyay Herald, 25 June 1937, p.1. His brother Frederick worked for Mr J Monger before heading north to eventually establish himself in the Irwin district.Obituary for Frederick Ellery, Geraldton Guardian, 28 April 1945, p.3. In 1878 Charles entered into local politics,Twentieth Century Impressions of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Thiel, P.W.H. & Co., 1901. Facsimile edition produced by Hesperian Press, 2000, p.705. and on 8 June 1880 he married Louisa Boyer at the church in Culham. The couple had seven children including Constance who learnt the boot making trade. During this time Charles joined the town's brass band, which performed under the guidance of local miller Charles Marris, a staunch supporter of the temperance movement. The band performed at functions, dances, and fund-raisers, and led the temperance processions through town. Charles may have rented the premises, known today as Shoemaker House, from Daniel Connor, before buying the building. Connor, an expiree who came to Toodyay as a peddler, had a sharp nose for business and acquired a number of lots when the town of Newcastle was established in 1860. He was the first to build cottages and shops along the main street, which he rented out and later sold when his interests turned to the better investment possibilities of Perth. Around 1887-88 Charles and his brother James started investing in land around the new recreation grounds in North Newcastle. It had been anticipated that once the Clackline to Newcastle railway line was completed it would continue across the river and make its way up the Toodyay Valley. Barnard Drummond Clarkson who owned the land had one acre lots surveyed. James Ellery bought seven lots and in 1888 built the first three cottages in North Newcastle, (two of these are Donegan's cottage and Parker's cottage).Chitty, Ian, Toodyay. ‚ÄòA Survey of Historical Buildings‚Äô. Study for the Toodyay Shire Council, undated, c.1976. Western Mail, 22 December 1888, p. 34. Charles bought one lot, and in partnership with Daniel Connor and William George Leeder another 11 lots.Newcastle Early Land Titles, compiled by Beth Frayne, Toodyay Historical Society, 12 December 2008, updated 24 October 2013. While Charles may have run a very successful business as a bootmaker, it could be surmised that James, a bachelor, was a contributor to the family's fortunes. Apart from working with Charles for a while, and apparently as a cabinetmaker in Newcastle in 1886, during the 1880s most of his time was spent in Cossack where he had a schooner and was involved in the pearling industry.Bicentennial Dictionary of Western Australians. Research paper, ‚ÄòJames Henry Ellery 1850-1934)‚Äô, provided by Lorraine Evans and lodged with the Toodyay Historical Society. After the turn of the century Charles became increasingly involved with the town. In 1901 he was a member of the inaugural Newcastle Board of Health, served on the Toodyay Road Board from 1903‚Äì05, and was a member of the Toodyay Municipal Council for 25 years. In 1906 he became a member of the Newcastle Vigilance Group that sought to promote improvements to Toodyay. He was part of the campaign to extend the railway, improve health services and the town's water supply.Bicentennial Dictionary of Western Australians, Erickson, Rica, Old Toodyay and Newcastle, Toodyay Shire Council, 1974, p.350, p.353. =Ellery legacy= Ellery's Buildings, Toodyay c1910s In 1902 Charles began investing in property next to the Freemason's Hotel. Eventually the stretch of shops along this section from the hotel became known as Ellery's Arcade, although not all the shops were owned by Ellery. When Charles died on 5 June 1937, his daughter Constance, a spinster, continued the family business until her death in 1968.Bicentennial Dictionary of Western Australians Many locals have fond memories of Aunty Connie who repaired their school shoes and she was well regarded for the quality of her work. She was also a skilled cake decorator. In 1933 she made a magnificent triple-decked cake for Toodyay's centenary celebrations that was put on display in the front window of the Wendouree Tearooms. The cake was decorated with black swans, sheep, fruit, flowers, Union Jacks and 100 candles. In 1955 she made a cake for Eric and Shirley Patten's wedding. Shirley recalls Connie as a small, quiet lady with a sense of purpose about her and always wearing an apron when she was working.

Early life Durlacher was born on 14 March 1870 at White Peak Station near Geraldton, to Deborah Wilberforce Durlacher (the daughter of Michael Clarkson). Doris's father, Alfred Durlacher, had committed suicide four months earlier. After Durlacher's birth, the family moved to Toodyay to stay with relatives, before moving to Fremantle, where she attended school. After some years living in Fremantle the family moved to Perth where, after finishing her education, Durlacher opened a school for young children in Adelaide Terrace. Career During the first decade of the 20th century, Durlacher returned with her mother to Newcastle, where she worked as a nurse. She is listed as Nurse Durlacher for the first time in the 1908 Newcastle Post Office directory. In 1905 Nurse Despard, who had trained in Melbourne, opened a maternity hospital in Newcastle in Leeder's House in Stirling Terrace. The Sisters of Mercy had vacated the house when they moved into the newly built convent on the outskirts of town. A maternity hospital was unusual for those times; the practice was for home births assisted by a midwife. The passing of the Health Act in 1911 required midwives to be registered. By 1913, Durlacher was one of a number of women to appear on the first Register of Midwives in Western Australia. In January 1925, Durlacher resigned from the hospital to take up private nursing. During her career, Durlacher delivered 190 babies, and only lost one. She was held in high esteem for her commitment to her profession and her compassion for those she helped. Following her death in May 1942, the following appraisal was published in the Western Mail: Later life Around 1930 Durlacher retired and started enjoying a sociable life with her friends playing bridge and going to the cinema. She was also an accomplished needlewoman; \\"... during the last months of her life she made no less than 57 cloths of various kinds, beautifully embroidered.\\" She became an active member of the Karrakatta Club serving for some years on the executive committee. She also had a keen interest in the Girls' Friendly Society, a philanthropic body originally established in England to assist working class women and girls with out-of- wedlock pregnancies.

Origins Dutton was born in England, a son of John Dutton. In the 1830s he ran a store in Singleton, New South Wales with his brother Henry Pelerin Dutton (c. 1803 ‚Äì 30 January 1870); the partnership broke up in 1837. H. P. Dutton (for a time reported as \\"Henry Pelham Dutton\\"), then ran a property on the nearby (St.) Patrick's Plains, became insolvent in 1844, and took up a pastoral lease in Queensland. Henry was the father of Queensland politician Charles Dutton. Charles Dutton arrived in South Australia on the Abeona from Hobart in March 1838. He may have gone back to England then returned with his wife Ellen, n√©e White, on the Dorset in January 1839. In Adelaide he was appointed clerk of the Supreme Court, and acted for a time as sheriff. Likely massacre on Eyre Peninsula Dutton pioneered and managed a cattle station named \\"Pillaworta\\", near Port Lincoln on the Eyre Peninsula, on behalf of pastoralist Charles Driver. In July 1842 he decided to abandon it through fear of the local Aboriginals, either the Nauo or Barngarla people, who were making hostile raids. Having taken his wife and children back to Adelaide by ship, he picked up a scratch team of Graham, Cox, Haldane and Brown (a former Adelaide policeman) to drove his cattle overland to safety near Adelaide. For the first day they had Lieutenant Hugonin of the 96th Regiment of Foot as an armed escort. Setting forth with 250 cattle in the direction of present Port Augusta, Dutton and his associates were never seen again, and no trace was ever found. All indications are that the entire party of five men were killed by Barngarla warriors somewhere near present Whyalla. There was no doubt about the attack by Aborigines on the nearby farm of Rolles Biddle, a Quaker cousin of Samuel and Frederick White, associates of Herbert B. Hughes. Biddle was killed, along with Mrs Stubbs and shepherd James Fastins on 29 March 1842. Search parties Several months later, when Dutton's party did not arrive as expected, search parties were launched. The most immediate, setting out in September 1842, was a determined party of four young pastoralist volunteers comprising the brothers G.C. Hawker and J.C. Hawker, William Peter, and James Baker. Governor Grey considered that this volunteer party was too small and ordered police inspector Alexander Tolmer, plus four troopers, to accompany them, but the dogmatic Tolmer fell out with the independent 'gentlemen' and so returned to Adelaide, while the pastoralists not only continued on to Port Lincoln, but also chartered a vessel for a coastal search. Governor Grey then ordered the petulant Tolmer back into the search, but under the command of Edward John Eyre, supported by Thomas Burr. None of these searchers found any trace of the five men, although some of their cattle were later found wandering. Dutton Bay (now Mount Dutton Bay) near Port Lincoln, was named for him. Family Charles Christian Dutton was married to Ellen Dutton, n√©e White, ( ‚Äì1853). Their children included: *Charles William Dutton (1839 ‚Äì December 1916) was from 1865 manager of Yaluna and Strawberry Hill stations for W. R. Mortlock, later also Coffin Bay and Waratta. He married Matilda Jane Swaffer (c. 1845 ‚Äì November 1924) on 16 January 1862. *Emma Pillawarta Dutton (1840 ‚Äì ) married James Gall on 4 June 1863. *Julia Eliza Dutton (1842 ‚Äì 27 June 1916) married Edward Daniel Swaffer (c. 1842 ‚Äì 4 November 1930) on 30 January 1865. His widow married again, in Port Lincoln on 3 September 1845, to Thomas Bond Hawson. Sydney businessman John Alexander Dutton (c. 1800 ‚Äì 13 February 1849) was also a brother. Another possible relation was Rose Ann Dutton (d. 20 October 1836). She married John Laurio Platt (1784 ‚Äì 20 May 1836) in Heligoland around 1815; they later moved to New South Wales in the Providence under Captain Herd, settling in Sandgate in 1822. Platt was a pioneer of the Patrick's Plains area near Singleton, New South Wales. They were not immediately related to the well known family of Frederick Hansborough Dutton (1812-1890), founder of Anlaby Station in South Australia.

The collaboration has become notable for its high-end limited edition colorways and general releases offered by the Yeezy Boost sneakers line up. The collaboration has also produced shirts, jackets, track pants, socks, women's shoes and their newly released slides. The first shoe model (\\"Boost 750\\") was released in February 2015. History American rapper Kanye West had collaborated with Nike before his partnership with Adidas Kanye West originally designed a shoe for Adidas in 2006, but it was never released. The first brand to officially collaborate with Kanye West was Bape. Together, West and Bape released a pair of Bapesta \\"College Dropout\\" shoes, which are now quite rare and garner high resell prices. He has also designed shoes for Louis Vuitton and Giuseppe Zanotti, and (most notably) Nike. His collaboration with Nike lasted for five years and led to the release of a total of three (two silhouettes, Yeezy 1 and the Yeezy 2) sneaker styles. In 2013, after the release of the \\"Red October\\" Air Yeezy 2s, Kanye West officially left Nike. Although West described this break as \\"heartbreaking\\", he claimed that Nike would not pay him royalties for his shoe designs, instead offering to pay some of the proceeds to a charity of West's choice. This ultimately led West to reach out to Adidas.The Ultimate Yeezy history Adidas agreed to give him royalties, and West described the CEO of Adidas as \\"someone who allowed [him] to build something\\". In February 2015, a year and three months after the confirmation of the Adidas and Kanye West collaboration, the collaboration officially debuted. \\"Yeezy Season 1\\" was highly anticipated and celebrities such as Rihanna, Diddy, and Kim Kardashian were at the showing. \\"Yeezy Season 2\\" and \\"Yeezy Season 3\\" also saw notable amounts of success upon their releases.

Clothing \\"Yeezy Season 1\\" was released on October 29, 2015, and was the first apparel collection to release from this collaboration. This collection was noted for its stripped-down, ready-to-wear style, which drew on military clothing and flesh-toned colors. The prices ranged from $600 for sweatpants to $3,000 for jackets. Although the footwear sold out quickly, the apparel collection did not. West revealed in a 2018 interview that he was in talks with Louis Vuitton for a $30 million apparel deal. The deal was not approved by the LVMH board and West was left with no clothing partners. After the \\"Yeezy Season 1\\" show, Adidas announced they would no longer be a part of Yeezy apparel, instead focusing on the footwear collection with West. With Yeezy Season 6, Adidas and West re-introduced several articles of clothing with Adidas branding. Footwear Through a combination of factors including popularization by celebrities, Adidas Yeezy sneakers have come to be extremely influential and highly coveted.

The original structure was built in Gothic architecture in 1745 by Kanakaraya Mudali, the longest serving dubash of the French East India Company. During the opening of the Church, Mudali hosted a feast that included all castes and religions, the first of its kind that is recorded in the history of South India. It is believed that the Church was destroyed by the British in 1761 and was later rebuilt in 1830. It is the first Church in South India to have an inscriptions made in Tamil during the times. St. Andrew's Church is a working church with hourly prayer and daily services and follows Roman Catholic sect of Christianity. The chapel was controlled by Capuchin priests initially and then changed hands to Petiti Seminaire School Fathers up to 1860. In modern times, it is under the dominion of Archdiocese of Pondicherry and Cuddalore. It is one of the most prominent landmarks in Puducherry. Architecture The church is built in Gothic architecture. The altar has conventional Catholic images in the altar and a vestry for the devotees. The bust size statue of Kanakaraya Mudali is housed over his tomb in the precincts of the church. The plaques of Our Lady and St. Andrew are housed in glass chambers in standing posture on either side of the altar in the walls facing the devotees. A grotto of St. Andrews is located outside the entrance of the vestry near the entrance.

Pondicherry was founded by 1674 by Francois Martin, while the French East Indian Company by Thaniappa Mudaliar in 1691 CE. The colony passed hands between the French and British colonial Empire till 1816 when it became a permanent colony of the French. Some accounts place that the church was built in 1675 by Capuchins following the Apostle St. Andrew. Other accounts place that the church was built in the fort by Father Ephraim de Nevers in 1642 as a temporary structure, which would go on to be modified as a permanent structure in 1675. As per other accounts and also the official history of the Church, it was built by Kanakaraya Mudali (1696- 1746), the grandson of Thaniyappa Mudaliyar and the longest serving dubash for the French Colonial Empire in 1745. He hosted a multi caste religious feast in the region subsequently attended by people across different castes and religions in the region.

In 1976, he was the subject of a biography by Christopher Keane. In that biography, Sue Lyon states, \\"He's the only man I know who can do a bastard's job with taste and come off looking like a nice guy.\\" The 1980 movie The Hunter starring Steve McQueen was based on Christopher Keane's novel. At 310 pounds and six-foot-two, Keane states, there is a \\"different Papa than the modern day bounty-hunter. Papa is also \\"a church-bishop; Master bridge champion; renowned astrologer; criminology alumnus of the University of California, Berkeley; child-nutritionist, aficionado of classical music.\\" Papa was born on 11 July 1926 in Anaconda, Montana. His mother, the former Margaret Hayford, had married his father, Ralph Edgar Thorson, Sr., in 1923. The Thorson family had immigrated from Norway in 1886, while the Hayford family had immigrated from England in 1635. Papa served in the US Navy during World War II, first in flight training and then on board the USS Ingersoll. Following the war, he returned home to Anaconda, but moved to San Rafael, California with his mother, after his father died. At 22, he had a short duration marriage to a \\"rich girl\\" named Samantha while simultaneously attending Berkeley, working as a Juvenile Counselor and building a house. In June 1948, Papa was a pre-med major at Berkeley, while working the summer vacations bartending at Hoberg's Resort Hotel in Lake County, California. There Papa met a San Francisco bail bondsman named Boyd \\"Pooch\\" Puchinelli, whom he started working for in early Sept. Papa changed majors to criminology, learned how to scuba dive and play bridge, then moved to L.A. in 1958. There he started working for bail bondsman Richie Blumenthal. In 1968 Papa bought a two bedroom North Hollywood home across from James Doohan. In 1965, Papa's girlfriend, Dotty Barras, and her son Kenny, moved in. It was Kenny who gave him the name Papa. From 1969 to 1976, over a hundred people lived in Papa's house at various times. \\"They consisted mostly of men Papa had picked up and sent to jail. Not only did he house them and find them jobs where he could, he counseled them, loaned them money, sometimes bailed them out, and only rarely kicked them out when they took extreme advantage.\\" During that time, Papa also served the Temple of Inspired Living as a bishop, which enabled him to perform marriages, and negotiate civil and religious matters on behalf of the Temple. By 1976, Papa had logged 5000 cases, including Squeaky Fromme plus another Manson Family member picked up at Spahn Ranch. Papa's fee was 20 percent of the bail. However, when on a weekly retainer to Blumenthal, his fee dropped to 10 percent. A financial disagreement in June 1969 put a three-year hiatus to their bondsman/bounty- hunter business arrangement. Papa's habits included taping most of his phone conversations, \\"and instead of writing letters he tapes his voice and mails off the cassettes.\\" His view on astrology was that it discovered \\"what we are and not how we'd like to see ourselves.\\" His attributed his luck in a dangerous profession to \\"picking the right astrological moment to hunt the man down.\\" Papa states, \\"I relied on...a condition...which happens when I confront a situation I'm not exactly sure of, a dream-like state where everything moves in slow motion. Fear is not permitted because the territory around me is my own. I control it. I expect to succeed. I'm sure of it. Not cocky, but convinced. It's almost as if some secret force jacks up my perceptions. It's a twilight zone. I enter it just moments before the confrontation.

It is high monolithic and located on Vindyagiri at Shravanbelagola in the Indian state of Karnataka. It is so tall that it can be seen from 30 km away. It symbolizes Peace, Non violence, sacrifice worldly affairs, and simple living as followed by Jainism. Vindyagiri Hill is one of the two hills in Shravanabelagola; the other is Chandragiri, which is also a seat of several ancient Jain centers, much older than Gommateshwara statue. The Gommateshwara statue is dedicated to the Jain figure Bahubali. It was built around 983 C.E. and is one of the largest free standing statues in the world. The construction of the statue was commissioned by the Ganga dynasty minister and commander, Chavundaraya. Neighboring areas have Jain temples known as basadis and several images of the Tirthankaras. Chandragiri is dedicated to the Jain figure Bharat, the brother of Bahubali and the son of the first tirthankara Adinatha. One can have a beautiful view of the surrounding areas from the top of the hill. An event known as Mahamastakabhisheka attracts devotees from all over the world.Official website Hassan District The Mahamastakabhisheka festival is held once in 12 years, when the Gommateshwara statue is anointed with milk, saffron, ghee, sugarcane juice (ishukrasa) etc. from the top of the statue Heinrich Zimmer attributed this anointment as the reason for the statue's freshness. The next abhisheka will be in 2030. In 2007, the statue was voted as the first of Seven Wonders of India in a Times of India poll; 49% of the total votes went in favor of it.  Iconography  Mahamastakabhisheka at Shravanabelagola The statue depicts the prolonged meditation of Bahubali. The motionless contemplation in kayotsarga (standing still) posture led to the growth of climbing vines around his legs. The image of Gommateshwara has curly hair ringlets and large ears. The eyes are open as if he is viewing the world with detachment. His facial features are perfectly chiseled with a faint touch of a smile at the corner of the lips that embodies a calm inner peace and vitality. His shoulders are broad, the arms stretch straight down and the figure has no support from the thigh upwards. There is an anthill in the background which signifies his incessant penance. From this anthill, emerge a snake and a creeper which twine around both the legs and arms culminating as a cluster of flowers and berries at the upper portion of the arms. The entire figure stands on an open lotus signifying the totality attained in installing this unique statue. On either side of Gommateshwara stand two tall and majestic chauri bearers in the service of the Lord. One of them is a yaksh and the other one is a yakshini. These richly ornamented and beautifully carved figures complement the main figure. Carved on the rear side of the anthill is also a trough for collecting water and other ritual ingredients used for the sacred bath of the statue. In the introduction to his English translation of the GommatsƒÅra, J. L. Jaini writes: Mahamastakabhisheka The tableau of Karnataka depicting Mahamastabhisheka of Lord Gommateshwara, passing through Rajpath during the left The event has been attended by multiple political personalities including Krishna-Rajendra Wodeyar in 1910, and Narendra Modi and Ramnath Kovind in 2018. = Legend = According to legend, after completing construction of Gommateshwara statue, Chavundaraya organised a mahamastakabhisheka with five liquids, milk, tender coconut, sugar, nectar and water collected in hundreds of pots but liquid could not flow below the navel of the statue. Kushmandini appeared disguised as a poor old woman holding milk in the shell of half of a white Gullikayi fruit and the abhisheka was done from head to toe. Chavundaraya realised his mistake and did abhishek without pride and arrogance and this time abhisheka was done from head to toe. 1 See also * Gommatagiri * Chandragupta basadi * Bawangaja  Notes   References  * Alt URL  * External links Jain rock-cut architecture Jain pilgrimage sites Monoliths Colossal Jain statues in India Tourist attractions in Karnataka ","title":"Gommateshwara statue"},{"id":"48613492","text":"Hare Rama Hare Krishna is a 2011 Kannada-language Indian feature film directed by C.

He is Kanjuro Nomi, a samurai who wears an empty scabbard because he has lost his sword and with it his honour, while she is his daughter Tae. Surviving several assassination attempts by bounty hunters, he is captured by a rival clan and sentenced to The Thirty Days. This practice has arisen because the little crown prince has not laughed since his mother died in the epidemic that also carried off Nomi's wife. Condemned criminals are allowed 30 days to win their freedom if they can amuse the boy. If not, they are executed, which for a samurai like Nomi is by seppuku. Nomi devises various stunts which do not amuse anybody and, as the days tick by, his daughter and his guards try to improve his performances. She has the idea of allowing the public into the palace to cheer him on, and she also sneaks into the depressed little prince's bedroom to try and gain his sympathy. But Nomi's efforts are just not funny, and with every failure he loses more dignity. The noble warrior is reduced to a sad clown who, though everybody wants him to succeed, manages to disappoint them every time. After 30 futile days, he has to perform the ritual public disembowelling. On the way to execution, he slipped a note to a supposedly blind monk.

One day Mateo leaves his 10-year-old son Fortunato in charge of the house while inspecting a sheep flock. In his absence, a wanted criminal named Gianetto happens by and, knowing Mateo's reputation, asks to hide in the house. Fortunato hesitates but gives in after Gianetto offers him a silver coin.

Design  Specifications, from Jane's Veinticinco de Mayo was a steam-powered protected cruiser similar to built in the same shipyard for the Royal Italian Navy, but improved and larger. Its steel hull had a ram in the bow, and was protected with an armored belt and deck. Its main battery was two guns, one at the bow and another at the stern, and four 124 mm quick-firing guns per side. The secondary battery had twelve 47 mm and twelve 37mm quick-fire Hotchkiss guns. It had two masts, in its tops were mounted eight Maxim machine guns. It initially mounted three torpedo tubes, later increased to six. It also carried two steam boats with spar torpedoes.  History  In 1890 the Argentine government led by President Miguel √Ångel Ju√°rez Celman decided to purchase a new cruiser due to the dispute with Chile concerning the application of the boundary Treaty of 1881. The Argentine representative to the United Kingdom, Dr. Luis L. Dom√≠nguez, signed a ¬£ 260,000 (1,310,410 Gold Pesos) contract with shipyard W. Armstrong, Micthell & Co., in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, for the construction of a 3,500-ton cruiser which would be called Necochea. Before its completion it was decided to change its name to Veinticinco de Mayo (\\"25th May\\"), the tenth Argentine Navy ship with this name, and was launched on March 5, 1890 under that name. Its first commander was Capit√°n de Nav√≠o Ceferino Ramirez, previously in charge of the vessel's construction. Frigate captain S√°enz Valiente 25 de Mayo in 1901 In 1901, commanded by Frigate captain (Spanish: Capit√°n de fragata) Juan Pablo S√°enz Valiente, the ship was deployed to R√≠o Gallegos due to the incidents in √öltima Esperanza Sound, which also caused the Chilean government to deploy the cruiser . After that mission Veinticinco de Mayo was sent to R√≠o Santiago in reserve, commanded by Frigate captain Enrique Thorne. In 1910 the protected cruiser joined the 2nd Division, and participated of the Centenary of the May Revolution, after what it returned to reserve. It was reactivated during the First World War but with a low level of activity. In the following years was gradually dismantled, and in 1921 it was used only as a coaling pontoon. In the report sent to the Argentine Congress for the period 1927/28, the ship was referred as \\"inexistent\\".

Until 2020, Luhansk Oblast was subdivided into 32 regions: 18 districts (raions) and 14 city municipalities (mis'krada or misto), officially known as territories governed by city councils. In 2014, in Luhansk Oblast the War in Donbass started. As a result, part of the area was controlled by the Ukrainian government, whereas the rest was controlled by the forces of the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR). In particular, several raions and city municipalities were split between the government-controlled and LPR-controlled areas. To facilitate the governance, the Verkhovna Rada on 7 October 2014 made some changes in the administrative divisions, so that the localities in the government-controlled areas were grouped into districts.

Biography = Early life = Mieczys≈Çaw Adamek was born in Tashkent to Polish parents on 18 September 1918. After the end of World War I and the rebirth of the Polish State, Adamek returned to Poland with his family, where he grew up, graduating high school before attending the Crafts and Industrial School in Przemysl. = Flying career = In 1936, he entered the Air Force Non-Commissioned Officer's School for minors in Bydgoszcz, Poland. After his graduation in 1939 he was assigned to the Polish 113th Fighter Escadrille. On the first day of World War II (1 September 1939) he scored a shared victory on a He 111. On 6 September, Adamek intercepted a number of Ju. 87 aircraft and, alongside his fellow pilots, shot one down. It has been reported that Adamek, with no fuel remaining in his aircraft, was forced to land next to the downed Ju. 87, and together with locals captured the Luftwaffe pilot. On 18 September, Adamek was evacuated to France via Romania. After training on a Bloch MB.150, Adamek took part in the Battle of France, flying under the orders of Commander Eugeniusz Wyrwcki in the 4th Polish Squadron. On 22 June 1940 he flew across the Mediterranean to Algiers, and then via Casablanca and Gibraltar reached Britain in July. After training in different British schools Adamek was posted to the No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron. On 23 June 1941 he shot down a Bf 109 in a confirmed victory, and had a probable victory with another Bf 109. Adamek shot down a further Bf 109 on 12 July 1941, and another on 12 October 1941. On 8 December 1941 he downed an Fw 190. The next year, on 14 April 1942, he shot down a Bf 109, this being his fifth individual victory, and enough to give him the honorary title of fighter ace. In April 1943 he was transferred to No. 58 Operational Training Unit at RAF Grangemouth, Scotland where he served as an instructor. In November 1943 he was ordered to the No. 317 Polish Fighter Squadron, based at RAF Chailey in East Sussex, an Advanced Landing Ground designed to support the invasion of continental Europe by Allied Forces. = Death = On 18 May 1944, while particIpating in a 'Ranger' mission over Fecamp, France as Flight Commander, Adamek's Spiftire Mk IX was hit by flak. Adamek struggled to maintain altitude and was unable to return to base at RAF Chailey. His squadron leader ordered him to abandon the aircraft, which Adamek did over the English Channel. Sadly, his parachute became caught on the tail of his aircraft, and he drowned. There have also been unconfirmed rumours that Adamek was ultimately shot down by British Anti-Aircraft Defences. It is not clear whether, if so, this was in addition to flak received over France, or the only hit the aircraft received that day. Adamek is memorialised at a monument which can be found at RAF Chailey, alongside Flight Lieutenant Jan Kurowski of 308 Squadron, who was killed in action three days later. The monument carries a quote from Josef Chielnicki of RAF Poland: \\"A Nation will always live, if there are people ready to die\\". Adamek and Kurowski were the only two airmen to have been lost from this base. Adamek is buried in Northwood Cemetery, London, UK.

The Originals defeated the all-powerful Ballarat Miners outfit in a thrilling overtime victory to claim the South Conference final. The Originals then went on to win the CBA quarter-final against Dandenong, the semi-final against Brisbane and then the championship final against Knox. All four finals were held at the Originals' home court at the Devonport Sports Stadium. The team lost three games early in the season and then went on an unprecedented winning streak, to end the season with a 19‚Äì3 record. The make-up of the Originals' 1996 squad included top quality imports in Dave Biwer and Jason Pepper, and centre Marcus Bellchambers. The team also included naturalised former American Keith Bragg, as well as Ben Harvey and Ben Armstrong. In 2003, the team was renamed the Thunder after being known as the Brewers for a number of years. The following year, the Thunder collected their second SEABL South Conference Championship before winning through to the ABA National Final, where they were defeated 104‚Äì100 by the Cairns Marlins.

Former building (1911-1966) Imperial Hotel, the original building, about 1915 The Lounge, about 1920 The original building was designed by Charles Fitzroy Doll and built between 1905 and 1911. The height of the building was 61 meters and there were 15 floors. An extension to the hotel took place in 1913. As part of the extension, Turkish baths were constructed. The hotel had about 640 bedrooms.Vintage postcard from 1930s says:\\"640 bedrooms with hot & cold water, telephones, radio, central heating. Fully licensed\\"\\" The building was equally colossal as its neighbour the Kimpton Fitzroy London Hotel and the architectural style was a mixture of Art Nouveau Tudor and Art Nouveau Gothic, combining terra-cotta ornaments in which the corbels, gargoyles and statues were modelled with red brick. Towers rose above a high mansard roof of green copper. A Winter Garden occupied the ground floor between the two bedroom wings. Both Winter garden and Turkish Baths were decorated in glazed Doulton ware. Demolition of the building started in 1966 and was completed in 1967. It was demolished because of its lack of bathrooms and because, according to the Greater London Council, the whole frame of the building was structurally unsound. There was no possibility of saving it if a preservation order had been placed on the building. In truth, however, the building was probably a victim of fashion and the prevailing taste in the 1960s. All that remains of the building are 21 statues from the Turkish Baths, bells and a galleon, now placed in the courtyard of the current hotel. Current building The hotel was replaced by a new building of the same name. This building shares the lodge with the President Hotel. Other hotels in the Imperial network are the President, Bedford, Tavistock, Royal National, Morton and County, all situated on nearby streets.

One such donation consisted of the mining maps of Western Pennsylvania. Many of the coal mining companies are no longer in business and have closed or sold coal mines in the Western Pennsylvania region. These maps were determined to be of historical value and are now housed by the archives. Individuals and organizations that research drilling, 'fracking', the foundations of buildings, roadways and other structures often visit the ASC to examine the maps to establish the safety and accuracy of their projects. The ASC received canvas maps charting the existence, location and status of working coal mines and closed mines. These maps, some as long as 10 meters are stored in a climate controlled section of the archives. The Archive Service center has worked to add content from its collections to Wikipedia.

According to Rugaas, there are at least 30 calming signals. The type of signals a dog uses depends on the dog. The signals, however, are universal and all dogs understand them even if they do not use them. Dogs are known to use these signals with humans, too. The term has been used by other canine behaviour experts to explain dog behaviour. Popular dog illustrator Lili Chin has illustrated these signals. There are several others who have illustrated these signals. Several books on dog behaviour and training now use the term calming signals to describe dog-dog and dog-human communication. There are three main forms of communication used by dogs: auditory, visual, and olfactory. Auditory includes a diverse range of sounds, such as grunts, whines, yelps, screams, tooth snapping, growling, coughing, and barking. Visual communication often originates from the behaviour of wolves, displayed in the form of either aggressive/fearful acts, or dominant/submissive acts. For example, an aggressive wolf is characterized by pricked ears, with both head and tail held high. Similar behaviour would be displayed during an aggressive visual act of a domestic dog. Olfactory communication is often used to distinguish a female during the period of heightened sexual arousal and activity. Males are able to detect this sexual period from long distances, simply by the smell of her urine.  Use of signals by dogs  According to Rugaas, the following is a list of some typical situations that dogs are naturally uncomfortable with and try to communicate their discomfort with calming signals. * A person bending over the dog * Direct, prolonged eye contact * A person's face too close to the dog's face (e.g., kissing on the nose) * Someone sounds angry * Yelling and quarreling in the family * Someone is walking directly at the dog * The dog is excited with happiness and anticipation * Someone asks the dog to do something he does not feel like doing * Training sessions are too long and the dog gets tired * The dog is confused * A person hugs the dog * The dog feels trapped According to Rugaas, dogs stop using calming signals in the following situations: * If they have been punished for using the signals in the past * If they have been attacked when using them in the past * If the stress levels are too high * Pulling on the leash when they are giving the signal to another dog  Examples  = Licking/tongue flicks = Lip licking is a calming signal Licking is a signal that is used often, especially by black dogs, dogs with a lot of hair around their faces, and others whose facial expressions for some reason are more difficult to see than those of dogs with lighter colors, visible eyes and long noses. Sometimes it is nothing more than a very quick lick, the tip of the tongue is barely visible outside the mouth, and only for a short second. But other dogs see it, understand it and respond to it. File:(2010-06-20 17-03-40) SONY DSC-T700 (2592x1944).JPEG|Dark coloured dogs are likely to lick their lips as a calming signal = Sniffing the ground = Sniffing the ground is a calming signal Sniffing the ground may look anything like moving the nose swiftly down toward the ground and back up again, to sticking the nose to the ground and sniffing persistently for several minutes. = Turning away/turning of the head = Looking away is a calming signal The dog can turn his head slightly to one side, turn the head completely over to the side, or turn completely around so that the back and tail is facing whoever the dog is calming. This is one of the signals seen most of the time in dogs. When someone is approaching a dog from the front, he will probably turn away in one of these ways. When people or other dogs seem angry, aggressive or threatening, one of these variations of the signal may be seen. When the dog is taken by surprise or takes someone by surprise, he will turn away quickly. The same happens when someone is staring or acting in a threatening way. In most cases, this signal will make the other dog calm down. File:Head Turn to being Hugged.jpg|When hugged, dogs turn away. It's a reminder that you are being \\"impolite\\" ‚Äì a calming signal File:Full Body when approached.jpg|When one dog approaches the other turns away ‚Äì a calming signal = Play bow = Going down with front legs in a bowing position can be an invitation to play if the dog is moving legs from side to side in a playful manner. Just as often, the dog is standing still while bowing and is using the signal to calm someone down. These signals often have double meanings and may be used in many different ways ‚Äì often the invitation to play is a calming signal by itself because the dog is making a potentially dangerous situation less tense and diverts with something safe. When two dogs approach each other too abruptly, you will often see a play bow. This is one of the signals that is easy to see, especially because they remain standing in the bow position for a few seconds. = Walking slowly = High speed can be upsetting to many dogs, and they might want to go in to try and stop the one who is running. This is partly a hunting behavior and is triggered by the sight of a running human or dog. If the one running is coming straight at the dog, it involves a threat and a defense mechanism sets in. A dog that is insecure tends to move slowly. If you wish to make a dog feel safer, then you can move slower. = Freezing = Lifting a paw is a calming signal \\"Freezing\\" is when the dog stops abruptly and remains completely still, often looking out of the corner of his eye. This behavior is believed to have something to do with hunting behavior ‚Äì when the prey is running, the dog attacks. Once the prey stops, the dog will stop too. We can often see this when dogs are chasing cats. This behavior, however, is used in several different situations. When you get angry and aggressive and appear threatening, the dog will often freeze and not move in order to help you calm down. Other times the dog may walk slowly, freeze, and then move slowly again. Very often a dog will stop and remain still when someone is approaching. Should a dog be in a conflict situation with a human or dog and is unable to escape, freezing may be one attempt to calm the other dog or person. = Sitting down = To sit down, or an even stronger signal, to sit down with the back turned towards someone ‚Äì for instance the owner ‚Äì has a very calming effect. It is often seen when one dog wants to calm another dog who is approaching too quickly. Dogs may sit down with their backs turned against the owner when he or she sounds too strict or angry. = Walking in a curve = This signal is frequently used as a calming signal, and it is the main reason why dogs may react so strongly towards meeting dogs when they are forced to approach head on. Their instincts tell them that it is wrong to approach someone like that. Forcing dogs to approach each other head on can cause them to feel anxious and defensive, and can eventually result in aggressive behavior like barking and lunging at other dogs. Dogs, when given a chance, will walk in curves around each other. This is what they do when they meet off leash and are free to do things their own way. = Yawning = Yawning is a calming signal The dog may yawn when someone bends over him, when you sound angry, when there is yelling and quarreling in the family, when the dog is at the vet's office, when someone is walking directly at the dog, when the dog is excited with happiness and anticipation ‚Äì for instance by the door when you are about to go for a walk, when you ask the dog to do something he doesn't feel like doing, when your training sessions are too long and the dog gets tired, when you have said NO for doing something you disapprove of, and in many other situations. Other animals seem to use yawning as a signal too. Humans can use it too to calm down slightly stressed dogs. Yawning is a calming signal = \\"Smiling\\" = Either by pulling the corners of the mouth up and back, or by showing the teeth as in a grin. \\"Smiling\\" is a calming signal = Wagging the tail = Should a dog show signs of anxiety, calming or anything that clearly has little to do with happiness, a wagging tail isn't always an expression of happiness. = Urinating = Marking objects or locations with urine to claim the space as their own, or simply urinating in place. = Soft face = Making the face round and smooth with the ears close to the head in order to act like a puppy. (\\"No one will harm a puppy\\" is what the dog believes.) = Fiddling = Some dogs act like puppies, jumping around and act silly, throwing sticks around, etc. if they discover a fearful dog nearby. This is intended to have a calming effect. = Lying down = Might be seen when puppy play gets too rough. People can use this too by lying down if the dog is getting too excited. = Splitting = This is easy to observe when multiple dogs are interacting with each other. When tensions rise a bit between two dogs, a third dog might try to put his body between the two dogs. Dogs do this when they perceive tensions to rise between people too. If a dog is getting tense about something he sees at a distance, people can step between the dog and the disturbing view to \\"Split\\" and achieve the same result Humans can stand between the dog and the threat he perceives as a way to \\"Split\\"  References  Behavior by type of animal Dog training and behavior Ethology ","title":"Calming signals"},{"id":"48614097","text":"Alan Davidson (14 July 1897 - 1 August 1962) was an Australian cricketer.

It was used for example in parliamentary reports published in The Gentleman's Magazine from 1738 onwards under the title of the \\"Debates in the Senate of Magna Lilliputia\\" in which in order to circumvent the prohibition of the publication of parliamentary debates of the English Parliament the real names of the various orators were filleted or replaced by pseudonyms or anagrams;For example Sholmlng for Cholmondeley and Ptit for Pitt for example, Sir Robert Walpole was thinly disguised as '. It was often performed not to avoid legal action but merely to show deference to the privacy of some great personage, or not to offend his or her imputed sense of modesty by naming him or her as the author of some great or worthy deed or act.

The ship was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy before completion and renamed HMCS Bowmanville. Bowmanville served with the Royal Canadian Navy in the final years of the war and was sold for mercantile use in 1946. Renamed Ta Shun, the ship sailed under a Chinese flag, later being renamed Yuan Pei. In 1949, the former corvette was taken over by the Communist-controlled government of China and rearmed and renamed Kuang Chou. Kuang Chou was listed until 1976 and was stricken in 1986. Design and description The Castle class were an improved corvette design over their predecessor . The Flower class was not considered acceptable for mid-Atlantic sailing and was only used on Atlantic convoy duty out of need. Though the Admiralty would have preferred s, the inability of many small shipyards to construct the larger ships required them to come up with a smaller vessel. The increased length of the Castle class over their predecessorsChesneau, p. 63 and their improved hull form gave the Castles better speed and performance on patrol in the North Atlantic and an acceptable replacement for the Flowers.Brown 2007, p. 142 This, coupled with improved anti-submarine armament in the form of the Squid mortar led to a much more capable anti-submarine warfare (ASW) vessel. However, the design did have criticisms, mainly in the way it handled at low speeds and that the class's maximum speed was already slower than the speeds of the new U-boats they would be facing.Brown 2007, p. 127 A Castle-class corvette was long with a beam of and a draught of at deep load.Brown states the beam at and the draught at The ships displaced standard and deep load.Chesneau states the displacement at deep load as The ships had a complement of 120.Brown states the complement as 99 and Johnston states the complement of Canadian ships at 112 (7 officers and 105 ratings). The ships were powered by two Admiralty three-drum boilers which created . This powered one vertical triple expansion engine that drove one shaft, giving the ships a maximum speed of . The ships carried 480 tons of oil giving them a range of at . The corvettes were armed with one QF 4-inch Mk XIX gun mounted forward.Mk XIX = Mark 19. Britain used Roman numerals to denote Marks (models) of ordnance until after World War II. This was the nineteenth model of British QF 4-inch gun Anti-air armament varied from 4 to 10 Oerlikon 20 mm cannons.Brown 2007, p.126 For ASW purposes, the ships were equipped with one three-barreled Squid anti-submarine mortar with 81 projectiles. The ships also had two depth charge throwers and one depth charge rail on the stern that came with 15 depth charges. The ships were equipped with Type 145 and Type 147B ASDIC. The Type 147B was tied to the Squid anti-submarine mortar and would automatically set the depth on the fuses of the projectiles until the moment of firing. A single Squid-launched attack had a success rate of 25%.Brown 2012, p. 129 The class was also provided with HF/DF and Type 277 radar. Construction and career Nunney Castle was ordered on 23 January 1943 from William Pickersgill & Sons Ltd of Sunderland.Macpherson and Barrie, p. 162 Like all ships of the class, the vessel was named after a castle in the United Kingdom, Nunney Castle in Somerset and awarded the pennant number K446. The ship was laid down on 12 August 1943 and launched on 26 January 1944. At some point in 1943, the ship was formally transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy.Colledge, p. 98 The corvette was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 28 September 1944 with the pennant number K493. The ship was named after Bowmanville, a town in southern Ontario. After commissioning, Bowmanville worked up at Tobermory before joining the Mid-Ocean Escort Force escort group C-4 for convoy escort duty. The corvette served as convoy escort for the rest of the war. In June 1945, Bowmanville returned to Canada and was based out of Halifax until being paid off on 15 January 1946. Bowmanville was sold for mercantile use on 5 September 1946 and served under a Nationalist Chinese flag initially as Ta Shun, then later as Yuan Pei. In 1949, Yuan Pei was taken over by the Communist Chinese government after the Nationalists abandoned mainland China. The vessel was rearmed with two single guns, one gun and five single guns.Gardiner and Chumbley, p. 63 The ship was renamed Kuang Chou and was listed as being in service until 1976, and stricken in 1986.

The sessions of the academy were to take place in the Royal Library in Brussels, which at the same time became an institution open to the public.

Members were encouraged to write \\"dissertations\\" on particular topics or questions. The impact of this practice on the writing of history was to encourage discussion of technical and historiographical problems, rather than an antiquarian approach to uncovering the past.Tom Verschaffel, \\"The modernization of historiography in 18th-century Belgium,\\" History of European Ideas 31:2 (2005), 135-146 In 1794 the academy was closed down by the French Revolutionaries who had taken power in Brussels.

The cr√≥nica is a journalistic form common in Iberia and Latin America and which was widely cultivated in Portuguese Goa. It can be roughly defined as a literary text combining elements of the short story, the memoir and the opinion editorial. Born in Arossim, Ant√£o contributed several hundred such articles to O Heraldo and Di√°rio da Noite from the late 1950s until the demise or Anglicisation of these papers. Cr√≥nicas Ant√£o's cr√≥nicas reflect his preoccupations with environmental concerns, Goan culture, the future of the Portuguese language in the territory, and issues related to Alcoholics Anonymous, of which he was one of the first promoters in Goa Melo e Castro, Paul.Lengthening Shadows. Salig√£o, India: Goa, 1556, 2016. Short stories Ant√£o's stories, like the rest of his journalistic output, seem influenced by what we could loosely term existentialist concerns, such as alienation, freedom, absurdity, authenticity and self- determination.Lengthening Shadows. Salig√£o, India: Goa, 1556, 2016. Indeed, anecdote holds that Ant√£o was an acquaintance of Sartre's in Paris at the height of existentialism's influence and prestige. Yet Ant√£o's treatment of existential themes is always mediated by his engagement with Goan actuality, his concerns about the dissolution of Goan identity and the destruction of the Goan landscape.Lengthening Shadows. Salig√£o, India: Goa, 1556, 2016. Earlier, before the environment became an issue, he allowed his brother-in-law to extract sand from the dunes on his ancestral property - that was later sold to Park Hyatt Resort, Arossim. The extent to which the author himself was touched by existential despair, which here could be conceptualized as a loss of hope concerning the signification and transformation of life, is open to debate. His texts certainly seem delicately balanced between positive and negative elements.Lengthening Shadows. Salig√£o, India: Goa, 1556, 2016.

The village is built on a flat-topped hill, the name Bawomataluo meaning \\"Sun Hill\\", and is one of the best-preserved villages built in traditional style. The largest house is that of the chief and is believed to date back to the eighteenth century. Large stone slabs stand in front of the houses and an open space in the centre of the village is used for traditional ceremonies and rituals. In view of the original traditional architectural features of the settlement and its environment representing the megalithic monuments tradition, the site was included on Indonesia's national Tentative List for nomination as a World Heritage Site under Criteria (i), (iv), and (vi) in 2009. Location The Bawomataluo settlement on the island of Nias is located on a hill on a level ground about above mean sea level and is accessed by concrete steps. The hill is oriented in the southeast to the northwest direction. It covers an area of about . It is from the sea coast and is above the height likely to be reached by any tsunami. The settlement is planned to fit the topography of the land and a spring provides adequate supplies of water. It is surrounded by \\"valleys and deep gorges\\". The settlement is away from Teluk Dalam port, a sub-district of the Nias, and public transport facility is available to reach the site. History According to the family history traced to the 18th century settlement at Bawomataluo, the design of houses is credited to King Laowo who established the Kingdom in the region whose antecedence was to the Gomo family. The houses were built by Saonigeho (Siliwu Gere) who belonged to the same Laowo family. As of 2009, the fourth line of descendants of the Laowo family are residing in the settlement. Features The settlement is built around the megalithic monuments positioned in vertical and horizontal directions. These are locally called the daro-daro and the naitaro respectively. Daro-daro represents males and naitaro represents females. The funerary site where the stones are found is on a terraced land which is approached by climbing 7 stone steps in the first stage and 70 steps at the second stage (a total of 80 steps is also mentioned). Also located here is a stone feature in the open area which is part of the customary rituals. Two stone paved roads are aligned on either side of the megalithic stones, each of which runs for about , terminating at the house of the Chief or King of the community, at the southwestern end of the settlement; the house measures . This house is said to be the \\"oldest and largest on Nias\\". The house is built with large sized wooden beams in the interior. There is a drum in the house which is used to signal the start and end of meetings. Another notable feature in the house is of carvings in wood and an array of jaw bones of pigs. A large stone throne at the entry to the house is used by the Chief; by its side there is a depiction of a phallus carved out of stone. Outside the Chief's house there are stone tables where dead bodies used to be kept to rot. The earliest traditionally built houses for the people of the settlement are located on both sides of the road, facing each other at a space of . New houses have also been built in between the traditional houses which also face each other, and are in a straight line aligned in the northwest to the northeast direction. In addition, there are houses built at the center of the settlement which are in a row oriented towards the southeast. The entire complex consists of 500 houses, each with a household head, housing a population of 7,000. Apart from the size of the houses (omo hada) and a feature at its entrance to denote the status of the family, each house has a symbolic representation of the status of the head of the family. Houses are made of carved wood and reflects the skill of the local people in wood crafting. Training of people of the village for wars was performed in the past by jumping a stone wall of in height, which was fixed with sharp-edged sticks at the top. However, in the present practice the sharp-edged sticks are removed for ceremonial jumping. This jumping is also performed for financial considerations outside of ceremonial events. The cultural activity at the settlement is in the form of war dances by young men.

The Drainage Services Department (DSD) is a department of the Hong Kong Government responsible for drainage and sewerage. Since 2007 it has been subordinate to the Development Bureau. Responsibilities The department is responsible for stormwater drainage, sewage collection and treatment, and flood prevention. History Environmental protection was one of the main concerns of former governor David Wilson. Wilson stressed the importance of better planning, increased control of pollution discharges, and large-scale investment in improved sewage disposal infrastructure. He stated that Hong Kong needed more treatment facilities and new outfalls constructed sufficiently far out to sea, and promoted a new department to help achieve this. The Drainage Services Department was established in 1989. Major infrastructure works =Harbour Area Treatment Scheme= The Harbour Area Treatment Scheme (HATS) is a major sewage treatment infrastructure improvement scheme designed to improve the water quality of Victoria Harbour. Originally called the Strategic Sewage Disposal Scheme, the plan was drawn up in 1989 and construction of HATS Stage 1 commenced in 1994. It comprises a system of deep tunnels to convey sewage from eight Preliminary Treatment Works to the Stonecutters Island Sewage Treatment Works, which opened in 1997. The full Stage I system, which treats 75% of the sewage generated by the urban areas around the harbour, came online in December 2001. Construction of HATS Stage 2 commenced in 2008, and stage 2A was commissioned in 2015. HATS Stage 2B, comprising an underground biological treatment facility at Stonecutters Island, has been shelved as it is felt that the existing facility is sufficient at this time. =Drainage tunnels= The department has built several significant bored tunnels designed to intercept water running down mountain slopes and divert it from urban areas in order to prevent flooding. The largest of these is the Hong Kong West Drainage Tunnel, comprising an 11-kilometre long main tunnel and 8 km of adits. It stretches from Tai Hang in the east to an outfall just north of Cyberport. It was built at a cost of HK$3.4 billion. Construction commenced in November 2007 and the tunnel was commissioned on 22 August 2012. The Lai Chi Kok Drainage Tunnel encircles Sham Shui Po and Lai Chi Kok. It is a 3.7-kilometre tunnel, stretching from Shek Kip Mei to an outfall near Stonecutters Island, built at a cost of $1.7 billion. Construction commenced in November 2008 and the tunnel was commissioned on 18 October 2012. The Tsuen Wan Drainage Tunnel protects the Tsuen Wan New Town and Kwai Chung areas. The 5.1-kilometre tunnel begins at Wo Yi Hop, north of Kwai Chung, and curves around the north of Tsuen Wan proper. Past Chai Wan Kok, it parallels the Tuen Mun Highway a short distance and then empties into the Rambler Channel. Construction of the $1.5 billion tunnel commenced in 2007. It was commissioned on 28 March 2013. Vessels The department operates two sludge transport vessels, called Clean Harbour 1 and Clean Harbour 2. These ships transport sludge from the Stonecutters Island Sewage Treatment Works to the sludge treatment facility in Tuen Mun. The ships are equipped with gantry cranes capable of lifting sludge from the lorries directly into containers on board, and can lift 10 containers per hour. Each ship can carry 90 containers of sludge, a total of 1,200 tons of sludge.

Background  Charles and Frances Hutchinson were residents of Chicago's elite Prairie Avenue, living for over three decades in this house at 2709. The original house was designed in 1881 by George O. Garnsey and built in the Queen Anne style, and remodeled as shown here in 1888 to French Gothic tastes by Francis M. Whitehouse. After the neighborhood became less fashionable in the early years of the 20th century, the Hutchinsons moved to a cooperative apartment on E. Walton Place and their former home became a boarding house. It has since been demolished. Hutchinson was born in Lynn, Massachusetts in 1854 to Benjamin P. Hutchinson (1828-1899) and Sarah (n√©e Ingalls) Hutchinson (1833-1909), and relocated with his family to Chicago in 1856 after a brief stay in Milwaukee. In Chicago Benjamin Hutchinson founded Chicago Packing & Provision Co., which for many years was the leading meat processor in the United States. In 1863 he became one of the first directors of the First National Bank of Chicago and in 1881 founded the Corn Exchange Bank (with subsequent mergers and acquisitions now Bank of America) and as a member of the Chicago Board of Trade was known as one of the city‚Äôs wealthiest and most colorful speculators. Charles graduated from the Chicago public schools in 1872 and entered the business world as a clerk in his father's office, becoming a junior partner with his father in 1875 in the firm B.P. Hutchinson and Son., commission merchants. Although he never attended college, he was a founding trustee and the first treasurer of the University of Chicago, positions he held until his death. He married Frances Angeline Kinsley, daughter of Herbert Milton Kinsley, on May 26, 1881. Herbert Kinsley had, in the last decades of the 19th Century, become one of Chicago‚Äôs premier caterers and restaurateurs after having made his reputation during his peripatetic career in part by hosting a ball for the Prince of Wales at the Anglo-American Hotel in Hamilton, Ontario Canada. Because of his contributions to the world of philanthropy, art and education Hutchinson was twice awarded honorary degrees by what is today Tufts University, the first one a being a Master of Arts in 1901, and the second one an LL.D in 1920. Hutchinson was also the recipient of an honorary Master of Arts degree by Harvard University in 1915. For his service as consul general for Greece in Chicago during the World's Columbian Exposition, Hutchinson was awarded the Badge of the Order of the Redeemer by King George I of Greece in 1908. He was granted a knighthood by King Albert I of Belgium in 1919 for his work with the Belgian Relief Committee during World War I, and was a supporter of the founding of the League of Nations at the war's end. Hutchinson served as Chairman, Committee of Fine Arts for the World‚Äôs Columbian Exposition of 1893.  The Art Institute of Chicago  \\"Established in 1879 from the remnants of a foundering art academy, the Art Institute of Chicago grew into a sturdy organization largely through the efforts of ... Hutchinson, who served as its president from 1882 to 1924.\\" Although Hutchinson‚Äôs personal wealth was generated thru banking, grain speculation and meatpacking enterprises that his father had established after coming to Chicago in 1856, Charles L. Hutchinson‚Äôs ‚Äúgreatest enthusiasm was for art and the establishment and growth of the Art Institute‚Äù. Founded on May 24, 1879 as The Chicago Academy of Fine Arts; The Art Institute assumed its present name in 1882. Hutchinson was a founding trustee of the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts, and recognizing his energy and vision, was named by the board of trustees as its first president three years later when it was renamed the Art Institute of Chicago. As one of many accolades conferred on Hutchinson by the Art Institute, the trustees passed a resolution On October 22, 1907 dedicating Gallery 32 as the Charles Lawrence Hutchinson Gallery of Old Masters to commemorate Hutchinson‚Äôs twenty-fifth anniversary as president of the institution. After he died in 1924, his obituary notice in The Bulletin of the Art Institute noted that ‚ÄúHis entire life was devoted to public service, but his service to the Art Institute was so intimate, his devotion so complete that it is not possible to measure it. He was The Art Institute, and it will stand as his most permanent monument‚Äù. =The Art Institute on the move= State Street looking north at Monroe c. 1900. Pike's Building at 170 (now 106 S.) State Street, where the Art Institute first opened its doors as The Academy of Fine Arts, is shown to the far left, with the second Palmer House (1873) directly across the street on the far right. Battery D Armory stood on the east side of Michigan Avenue at Monroe Street. The building was used for various purposes, and \\"It appears that it occasionally required some pretty quick work to put the building into suitable condition for the morning art classes, after [the building] had been used the night before for a boxing match or a ball.\\" It was demolished in 1896. The John Wellborn Root-designed building at the southwest corner of Michigan and Van Buren, which opened in 1887. The building was sold to the Chicago Club in 1891 for $425,000, and collapsed during an extensive renovation of the property by the club in 1929. School of the Art Institute. Alexander N. Fullerton Memorial Hall, with its Tiffany stained glass dome, was completed in 1898, and in 1901 the Ryerson Library was finished, funded with a $50,000 donation ($1.4 million in 2015) provided by Hutchinson's friend Martin Ryerson. Charles L. Hutchinson saw the Art Institute thru every move and building program from the time of its founding until the time of his death in 1924. The institution‚Äôs first headquarters were located in Pike's Building at 170 State St. in the rooms of the recently defunct Chicago Academy of Design. They remained there until May 1 of 1882, when Hutchinson recognized that the growth of the organization required a larger facility that featured more artist-friendly accommodation. At that time the group relocated to rooms on the second floor of the D Battery Armory on Michigan Avenue (located just north of where today the Allerton Building of the Art Institute is located). The drive for what was intended to be a permanent facility also began that year when Hutchinson acquired a lot at the southwest corner of Michigan Avenue and VanBuren Street that had built on it a two-story commercial building that was leased in part to a medical college, for which he advanced the Art Institute the purchase price of $45,000. The Art Institute moved its offices into the vacant part of the building, and subsequent to the purchase a three-story addition of pressed brick was built on the back portion of the lot. Classes moved from the armory into this new space on January 8, 1883 and these accommodations remained the extent of the Art Institute's real estate holdings until 1885, when the lot to the immediate south was acquired for expansion. Because of the organization's continued rapid growth the medical college building was demolished in 1885 and a new building by John Wellborn Root was built around the 1882 structure to provide more classrooms, galleries and museum space, with a portion of the building set aside for artistically-oriented tenants and organizations whose rent was intended to help pay for the new building and its operations. Contemporary news reports credited the efforts of Hutchinson as being the drive behind the construction of the new building and ‚Äúthe one man to whom the Art Institute owes its splendid status‚Äù. Under Hutchinson's watch, plans for expansion of the museum's collection and the building program continued unabated. He used his influence as an organizer of the World's Columbian Exposition to acquire property for a new building for the Art Institute on the east side of Michigan Avenue in Lake Park (today Grant Park) on landfill that had been created with debris from the Great Chicago Fire. On this property was then located a structure that was initially designed and built as a conference center for the fair, but that afterwards became the new home of the Art Institute. It was intended that proceeds from the sale of the VanBuren Street building and $200,000 from the directors of the fair would provide the Art Institute with \\"a permanent home for art works which will eclipse everything in the nature of fine structures Chicago has known hitherto\\". This new structure (now the Allerton Building) replaced the Exposition Building (built in 1873) that was standing on the site, and was designed by Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge, the later of whom was a friend of Hutchinson's having been the architect of Hutchinson Hall at the University of Chicago (1890). The Art Institute moved into the new structure in November 1893 after the fair closed, and Hutchinson spent the next several years leading the effort to reconfigure the interior of the new building. The work entailed the building of the Grand Staircase and the creation of space for the school, libraries, galleries, and the filling of that space with world-class art acquired locally or (more frequently) thru buying expeditions to Europe and Asia. As the Art Institute was not able to provide Hutchinson with the generous purse that would be required for that purpose in those early days, this feat was effected thru Hutchinson's personal connections to Chicago's wealthiest families. An early coup in this regard for Hutchinson and Martin A. Ryerson, a fellow trustee and his frequent companion in these forays, was the 1889 purchase, \\"at great sacrifice\\" to the seller, of thirteen seventeenth century Dutch paintings that were purchased for $200,000, the money for which was advanced by Marshall Field, Philip Armour and others. The New York Press sniffed at this effort in what was perceived as an example of Chicago‚Äôs cultural barbarism, considering the city‚Äôs position as hog butcher to the world and its philistine reputation as a resolute accumulator of wealth for its own sake by whatever means: ‚ÄúHe (Hutchinson) probably paid $1,000 a front foot for them, and we assume the citizens of Chicago will give him a triumphal procession when they arrive, carrying them and him in huge floats, drawn by teams of milk-white Berkshire hogs that have been newly washed with a ten inch hose jet of water until their pink flesh shows under the clean bristles.‚Äù Hutchinson's connections would serve the Art Institute well over the next few decades. Among the notable additions to the museum's collection acquired through them included bequests by Bertha Palmer, Martin L. Ryerson and Clarence Buckingham, whose gifts would add resources which respectively formed the basis of the museum's notable Impressionist collection and augmented other collections with more than two hundred additional Old Master, Impressionist, and Post-Impressionist paintings and 1,400 Japanese woodblock prints. In 1912 a bridge was built to span the by-then suppressed tracks of the Illinois Central Railroad that ran immediately behind the 1893 building, and in 1916 a two-story structure was built on top of it, funded with a $50,000 donation made by railroad inventor William H. Miner. This structure was named Gunsaulus Hall to honor Frank W. Gunsaulus, museum trustee and the first president of the Armour Institute, and housed the museum's industrial arts and related media collection (the Alsdorf Galleries today occupy the first floor of that space). By 1920 there were talks in earnest regarding the addition of McKlintock Court and the Hutchinson Wing which surrounds it and the Goodman Theater/Goodman School of Drama, which was a gift of the family of the playwright Kenneth S. Goodman, who died in 1918. Ground for the building of the latter pair (by Howard Van Doren Shaw) was broken in 1923 and the theater opened to the public in 1925.

Background Born to a bhatkar, or landowning family, Epit√°cio Pais was a primary school teacher by profession. He attended liceu, or high school, in Portuguese before undergoing his teacher training. He contributed short stories in Portuguese to newspapers such as Di√°rio de Goa and O Heraldo from the 1950s to the 1980s. He also participated in the Portuguese-language programme Renascen√ßa, which ran on All-India Radio until the 1980s. For Jos√© Pereira, Pais was \\"one of Goa‚Äôs prominent writers of fiction in Portuguese\\".Jos√© Pereira Goa Today September 2000, accessed http://www.goa-world.com/goa/goatoday/sep2000/letters.htm , 3rd Aug 2010. For Manuel de Seabra and Vimala Devi, Pais was a writer who felt the world around him in all his poetry and tragedy and whose writing was reminiscent of Russian writers like Turgenev and Korolenko.Vimala Devi and Manuel de Seabra.A Literatura Indo-Portuguesa. Lisbon: Junta das Investiga√ß√µes do Ultramar, 1973 Os Javalis de Codval A collection of Pais's stories was published in Lisbon in 1973 by Editorial Futura under the title Os Javalis de Codval. =Themes= Several key themes recur in the short narratives contained. One subject is matrimony, a particularly prevalent topos in Lusophone Goan writing for the discussion of caste identities and social mores. In stories such as ‚ÄúFerdinando,‚Äù ‚ÄúDe Mal a Pior‚Äù or ‚ÄúUm Di√°rio e Duas Cartas‚Äù these perennial machinations are depicted within the context of a society undergoing deep social shifts that render these compacts even more fraught. Another subset of tales focuses on the breakdown of traditional rural society, featuring Hindu characters in the main and striking a similar tone to Pundalik Naik‚Äôs Konkani- language novel Upheaval, perhaps the most prominent Goan novel to deal with this subject. These stories include ‚ÄúUma Filha da Terra‚Äù and ‚ÄúMunu.‚Äù The third subgroup is represented by ‚ÄúOs javalis de Codval,‚Äù ‚ÄúO navio encalhado,‚Äù ‚ÄúHist√≥ria de minas,‚Äù ‚ÄúOutra hist√≥ria de minas‚Äù and ‚ÄúNo comboio.‚Äù All of these narratives involve in some way a journey out into uncertainty, a setting forth in search of wealth, security or merely sustenance that ends in some sort of reversal. Both the journeys and the conditions under which they are undertaken resonate with the social, economic and political changes occurring in Goa at the time in which the stories are set.Paul Melo e Castro. \\"Out Into Uncertainty: The Lonely Voices of Epit√°cio Pais‚Äôs Goan Short Stories\\". Luso- Brazilian Review, 51:2 (2014), pp.105-125 Unpublished Stories At his death, Pais left behind a dozen uncollected stories. It is unclear whether they had been broadcast or published in the written press in some form. These stories extend Pais's concerns beyond 1973. In 2003, the story \\"Um Portuguese em Baga\\" (A Portuguese in Baga) was published in the Portuguese-Language anthology of Goan writing \\"Onde O Moruoni Canta\\", which deals subtly with questions of identity in a post-colonial Goa.Paul Melo e Castro.

From a privileged yet impoverished family, Leo tries to strike it rich by any means possible in the Goa of the 1970s. Moving through various strata representative of the society of his times ‚Äì new ascendant classes linked to smuggling, mining and politics, hippies tired of the West in search of drugs and spirituality, the fishermen of the coast and repatriates from Idi Amin‚Äôs Uganda, the novel reaches a climax that defies local tradition even as it calls into question the principles of the new order.

Susanna Phelps Gage (1857‚Äì1915) was an American embryologist and comparative anatomist. She initially worked on the anatomy of small animals and humans, later shifting into neurology to study the embryological development of the brain and the anatomy of the human nervous system. She also developed a new and widely adopted method for making anatomical teaching models out of paper rather than wax. Although Susanna Phelps Gage was a respected embryologist and comparative anatomist, her work was often ignored. Like most other women scientists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries who were married to scientists, Gage's research was often viewed as a mere adjunct to her husband's projects. Early life and education Susanna Stuart Phelps was born December 26, 1857, in Morrisville, New York. Her father, Henry Samuel Phelps, was a businessman, and her mother, Mary Austin Phelps, had been a schoolteacher prior to marriage. In 1903, after her parents' death, Phelps gave the family home to the town of Morrisville to become the Morrisville Public Library; since 2005 it has been on the National Register of Historic Places. Phelps was educated at Cazenovia Seminary and in 1875 went on to Cornell University, initially for her undergraduate degree. She studied broadly, in Latin, English literature, history, and the sciences, becoming the first woman in the university's history to take a laboratory physics class. While still an undergraduate, she became fascinated with zoology and especially anatomy, taking every class offered in these subjects. She went on to earn her Ph.D. at Cornell in 1880. In 1881, Phelps married Simon Henry Gage (1851‚Äì1944), who was already an assistant professor of histology and embryology at Cornell, where he would spend his entire academic career. They had a son, Henry Phelps Gage, who became a physicist and inventor. Research in anatomy and embryology After gaining her Ph.D., Gage pursued independent research in comparative anatomy and embryology. Like many women scientists in the late 19th century, Gage never held a formal job congruent with her abilities and spent some of her time supporting her husband's career‚Äîfor example as an editor of at least one edition of his book The Microscope and as an illustrator for some of his papers. Although Gage's work was often overshadowed by that of her husband‚Äîthe first edition of American Men and Women of Science lists her as \\"Mrs. S.H. Gage\\"‚Äîshe became a respected scientist in her field, publishing in such prestigious journals as Science, American Journal of Anatomy, The Anatomical Record, and The American Naturalist, among others. In the second edition of American Men and Women of Science, she was one of only 25 women to be featured as highly significant in her field. She was elected a fellow of the American Academy for the Advancement of Science and was a member of the American Anatomical Association, the American Society of Zoologists, the American Microscopical Society, and the German Anatomical Society. Gage initially published on the anatomy of small animals such as turtles and birds as well as (later on) the anatomy of humans, sometimes co-authoring papers with her husband. When she began her career, the fibrous aspects of striated muscles in small animals were not well understood, and Gage's research in this area came to be considered fundamental. In 1904, Gage joined a research team at the Bermuda Biological Station for Research in St. George, Bermuda. Research in neurology Gage had become interested in neurology as a student while taking courses with the Cornell zoologist Burt Green Wilder. In 1905, she decided to study neurology formally, first attending Johns Hopkins Medical School in Baltimore, Maryland, and then moving to Harvard University. These studies influenced the course of her research into the comparative morphology of the brain and its embryological development, as well as into the anatomy of the human nervous system as a whole. Ten of her 26 solo-authored papers were on aspects of neurology and are considered her most important work. Anatomical models Gage was a skilled artist and illustrated both her own scientific papers and some of those by her husband. Gage was also the first person to demonstrate the feasibility and utility of making anatomical teaching models out of stacks of blotting paper rather than the more usual wax, arguing for such models on the basis of \\"the ease and cleanliness of their production\\" compared to the \\"drudgery\\" of making wax models, and for \\"the lightness and durability of the product.\\" Other embryologists copied her method, and several‚Äîincluding Ivan Wallin‚Äîrefined it further until the need for these kinds of models was superseded by other approaches in the 1930s. National university Gage believed in George Washington's idea that America should have a national university, and in the mid 1890s she helped to found the George Washington Memorial Association as a means to try to bring this about. In 1904, the association was instrumental in one stage of the expansion of Columbian University in Washington, D.C., and its name change to George Washington University. Gage suffered from failing health for the last four years of her life and died suddenly October 15, 1915, only 57 years old. Her husband survived her by almost three decades. Legacy Following Gage's death, her husband and son set up a memorial fund in her name that was used to build a room in the new women's dormitory at Cornell, Clara Dickson Hall. In 1918‚Äîto honor her spirit in leading the way for women in science at Cornell University‚Äîthey created the Susanna Phelps Gage Fund for Research in Physics at Cornell. Some of her papers and letters can be found in the Cornell University collection of her son's papers. A set of histological slides of sections of mouse brain prepared by Phelps in 1894 is held by Yale University.

Early life  From 1977-80 he attended the Ontario College of Art, followed by 17 years working in the Art & Photography Department of the Hospital For Sick Children in Toronto, in their art therapy program. Inspired by surrealists such as Frida Kahlo and Salvador Dal√≠, Caesar's experiences at the Children Hospital deeply influenced his artwork. Caesar said: \\"Working in a photography department in a Children's hospital is the act of chronicling everything from child abuse, re- constructive surgery, to the heroic children that deal with the hardship and challenges that life has to offer. I spent many years creating medical and research documentation, medical and technical drawings, images of huge equipment surrounding tiny premature infants and visual tools for brain- damaged children\\". From 1998 to 2001 he worked as a senior animator in GVFX, Toronto, where he mastered his skills in using 3D modelling software.  Artistic style  Ray Caesar's work is digitally created using 3D modelling software called Maya, mastered while working in digital animation for television and film industries from 1998-2001. His portraits involve contrasting elements of childlike innocence, grotesque physical deformities, and sexual innuendos. In his creations he merges elements of decorative styles and architectural ages, mixing Art Dec√≤, Victorian style and visual codes from the early 1900s. According to an interview with \`\`Empty Lighthouse Caesar begins his process with \\"automatic drawing which is basically just letting your hand do first what your mind hasn't thought about.\\" His work often contains elements which are invisible in the final render such as \\"old letters and photographs in lockets [that are tucked] away into drawers that are closed.\\" According to Caesar, \\"I know they are there... and I love that sometimes I forget they are there.\\" Caesar likens the virtual environment to \\"a dissociative fugue or very deep daydream... you can get lost in there very easily.\\"  Professional credits  In 1999, Caesar received a Primetime Emmy Nomination for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for his work on Total Recall 2070, a Gemini Nomination for Special Effects and a Monitor Award for Special Effects in a series.

Originated in the Middle Ages, it gave to the island numerous personalities who have made a significant contribution to its social, political, intellectual and artistic life, as well as a mastermind behind a major heist. The different branches of the family collected, over the centuries, numerous fiefdoms and noble titles. History The name of the family derives from Bartolo of Andernach, a descendant of Gerlach of the House of Wangenii of Ch√¢teau de Wangenbourg, since the 5th century lords of \\"Andermacco in Alsace\\" (Andernach, castle on the Rhine). Bartolo descended into Italy in 951 a.D. as \\"signifer\\" (assistant) of the Holy Roman Emperor Otto I. Returning to Germany to face the threat of the Magyars - which he defeated at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955 - the Emperor appointed Bartolo as governor (\\"gubernator\\") of Pisa. At his death, Bartolo was succeeded by his son Lucchino, called by the local population Lucchin di Noterbartolo, \\"Lucchino (son) of Notarius Bartolo\\". His descendants lived in Pisa, Siena, Perugia and other cities of medieval Italy, where they were known as knights and men of letters, intermarrying with numerous illustrious families. As a consequence of the war between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, a descendant belonging to the latter faction, Pietro Notarbartolo Farfaglia, moved in the late 13th century to Catania. Pietro, Royal Secretary of Aragonese King Frederick III of Sicily, obtained by the latter in feudum the control of the city of Polizzi. In Sicily, the family flourished - at first in Polizzi and, later on, especially in Palermo - gaining numerous fiefdoms and titles and later subdividing in the 16th century in the two main branches of the Princes of Sciara and of the Dukes of Villarosa. Members of both the branches, as well as of the branch of the Princes of Furnari, were Peers of the Realm. Throughout the centuries, the House of Notarbartolo established tight familiar and economic relationships with many of the most influential Italian families. Just to mention a few, the family intermarried with the Houses of Alliata, Filangeri, Gravina, Grimaldi, Lancia, Moncada, Obizzi, Patern√≤, Piccolomini, Spucches, Stagno, Tomasi di Lampedusa, Valguarnera, Ventimiglia. A distinguished representative of the family was the Marquis Emanuele Notarbartolo (1834 - 1893), mayor of Palermo and Director General of the Banco di Sicilia, widely considered as Mafia's first eminent victim in 1893. One of the most important streets of Palermo is dedicated to him, as well as the Notarbartolo Railway Station. The branch of the Princes of Sciara had as family residence in Palermo the palace of la Zisa, later expropriated by the Italian state in 1955 and appointed World Heritage Site (UNESCO) in July 2015.

Rodrigo Duterte, who was then serving as Mayor of Davao City, had refused to run and turned down other presidential and vice-presidential aspirants' offers to be his running mate, including that of Jejomar Binay, Miriam Defensor-Santiago and Bongbong Marcos. He was eventually elected President of the Philippines. Duterte's positions resonated with older, working class Filipinos. This was particularly true regarding his promise to eliminate the wide-scale drug menace of the country, his record of zero criminal tolerance in Davao City, which he served for more than 22 years, as well as his stronger position against corruption. Duterte's campaign reached out to Filipinos who had been suffering poverty, were strongly nationalistic, and had growing distrust of Western institutions as well as the political establishment in Manila that were supposedly controlled by the elites and oligarchs. In his campaign, Duterte accused political elites of not doing much to solve problems in a move that was described as populist.  Background  = Calls to run for presidency and negotiations = In his speech during the change-of-command ceremony of the Philippine National Police, then-candidate Duterte credited former president Fidel Ramos as his inspiration. Ramos was the first person who flew to Davao City to ask Duterte to run for president. Early in 2015, Duterte hinted to the media of his intent to run for the presidency in 2016, with the promise of abolishing Congress in favor of a parliament should he win. Earlier, in February 2014, Duterte was reportedly enjoying the support of several netizens who were lauding his performance as mayor of Davao, especially in maintaining peace and order in the city, but he was quick to shrug off calls for him to run for president, saying that he was not qualified for a higher public office. A year later, Duterte said in a Baguio federalism forum that he would only run for president \\"if (it is) to save the republic.\\" Duterte cited the need for about 10 to 15 billion pesos for a campaign war chest as what was keeping him from running. Days later, however, Duterte \\"re-entered\\" PDP‚ÄìLaban; he maintained that he never left the party, and only had to stand under the local party banner, Hugpong sa Tawong Lungsod, in the 2013 local election in order to ensure his victory. PDP‚ÄìLaban president Aquilino Pimentel III later said that Duterte was among his party's options for a presidential candidate for 2016, noting that the party's position on federalism coincides with Duterte's advocacy. A few days after reports came out saying incumbent Vice-President Jejomar Binay (a presidential aspirant) was eyeing Duterte as his possible running mate, Duterte issued a statement saying that he was not interested in running for a national post. In September 2014, Duterte declined presidential aspirant and then-incumbent Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago's offer to be her running mate, saying that instead of picking him as the senator's running mate, she could ask former Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro, Jr. In March 2015, Lakas‚ÄìCMD national president Ferdinand Martin Romualdez announced that his party was preparing for the 2016 elections; incumbent congressman Danilo Suarez remarked that they were convincing Teodoro to come out of retirement and run anew for a higher office. In October 2015, Santiago chose Bongbong Marcos as her running mate. Rodrigo Duterte Later, during the airing of his weekly program, Gikan Sa Masa, Para Sa Masa, on a local channel on June 21, 2015, Duterte stated that he was considering suggestions from his friends and supporters to run for president. He also added that he would stop expressing non-interest in starting a presidential campaign. At the ASIA CEO Forum in Makati held on June 25, 2015, Duterte again stated that he would not run for a national office, and said that he never desired to do so. A month later, however, Duterte, responding to Justice Secretary Leila de Lima's statement that she would not run with Duterte as a matter of principle, saying that he would campaign against the Liberal Party if De Lima is drafted, calling her \\"hypocritical\\" and her principles \\"rotten\\". In August, while at a meeting with military officers, Duterte spoke with Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) founder Jose Maria Sison. Duterte said that he told Sison that he would run for president if the CPP's armed wing, the New People's Army, abandoned its over-40-year insurgency, saying, \\"Armed struggle as a means to achieve change is passe in the modern world we are living in today.\\" Duterte disclosed that Sison was asking him about his plans for 2016 and that he told Sison he did not have plans yet. On September 7, 2015, in a press conference held at Davao City, Duterte declared he would not be running for president in 2016 and apologized to all of his supporters on the decision. He additionally stated that he might retire from politics after his term as mayor of Davao City ends in 2016 and if his daughter ran for the office. Other factors in his possible retirement included age, health concerns and his family's objections.Duterte's final answer: I won't run for president ‚Äì Inquirer.net.

Since Duterte claimed that one of the primary reasons that he declined a presidential bid was a lack of finances needed to bankroll a campaign, supporter Atty.

In their general meeting held in Pasay City on October 26, members of PDP‚ÄìLaban expressed their support to Di√±o in his presidential bid. On October 21, Duterte told CNN Philippines' News.PH via phone patch interview that there was still a chance that he would change his mind. The decision, however, would have to be made by PDP‚ÄìLaban. On October 26, 2015, Duterte said in an interview that his deadline for deciding whether to seek the presidency was December 10. He also warned the people to abide by the law if he wins. On October 27, PDP‚ÄìLaban made it official that Duterte will substitute as the party's presidential bet if aspirant Martin Di√±o withdraws or is disqualified by the Commission of Elections (Comelec) from the 2016 race.PDP-Laban decision final: Duterte to substitute if Di√±o withdraws presidential bid ‚Äì CNN Philippines. Two days later, PDP‚ÄìLaban standard bearer Martin Di√±o withdrew his presidential bid and named Duterte as his substitute because there was a possibility that Di√±o might be declared a nuisance candidate by the COMELEC. On October 30, an alleged campaign video of Duterte and Cayetano circulated on social media that put hopes on Duterte's candidacy as Cayetano's running mate. However, Duterte's aide Bong Go said in an interview that Duterte's mind had not changed yet but that he would continue soul-searching with his family to know if he would run in the upcoming election. On November 1, Duterte said that nothing had changed and that he was not fit for national office. He also said that he was still waiting for a communication from his party about his possible candidacy; Duterte would also wait if his daughter would agree to substitute for him at the mayoral race of Davao and would retire from public service if Sara agreed to do so. On November 2, Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV) executive Arwin Serrano said that Di√±o was deemed to face an election sabotage complaint because of proposing Duterte as his substitute for him; however, Di√±o denied allegations that his filing of candidacy was just a front to pave the way for Duterte's possible substitution. Comelec chairman Andres D. Bautista, in an interview on November 3, stated that although they have noted Di√±o's withdrawal, they would not move with any further action with regards to a possible substitution until they had Duterte's consent and unless it would be made official with a COC and a certificate of nomination and acceptance from PDP‚ÄìLaban.Comelec won't move on Di√±o's withdrawal unless Duterte agrees to be his substitute ‚Äì GMA News Online. Duterte himself then further clarified that his decision of acceptance for the substitution offer would be on the deadline itself come December 10. = Official acceptance for substitution = On November 21, in a gathering held in his alma mater San Beda College, Duterte announced his presidential bid and also finally accepted Alan Peter Cayetano's offer to be his running mate. Duterte said he was disappointed over the decision made by the Senate Electoral Tribunal (SET) regarding Grace Poe's citizenship as well as the current administration's handling of the 'laglag-bala' issue. Duterte further stated that he would file his candidacy immediately after he reached out to his party.Duterte decides to run for president ‚Äì ABS-CBN News. On November 27, Duterte filed his certificate of candidacy for president through a representative in Metro Manila shortly after withdrawing his COC for Davao City mayoralty re-election. The document was filed along with a certificate of nomination and acceptance from PDP‚ÄìLaban signed by Duterte and the party's vice president, Engr. Salvador Ty. In withdrawing his COC for Davao City mayor, Duterte named his daughter, Sara, as his substitute. Sara submitted the document for substitution at Comelec Davao and both COCs were received.Duterte files COC for president ‚Äì GMA News Online.  Campaign  Duterte and allies campaigning in Pandacan, Manila Duterte topped all other presidentiables including former front-runner Grace Poe in a survey published November 25 and held by Pulse Asia. Poe said that the survey was \\"inconclusive\\" and \\"not reflective\\" and claimed it was made by Duterte's camp. On November 29, 2015, the supporters of Duterte and Cayetano held an event named \\"MAD for Change: Tunog ng Pagbabago\\" (lit. MAD for Change: Sound of Change) in Taguig. It included free-head shaving, free T-shirt printing services, and the main concert. Several musicians performed, including Jimmy Bondoc, Thor, and Luke Mejares. Duterte arrived in the event together with his running mate Cayetano. On November 30, the PDP‚ÄìLaban declared Duterte and Cayetano as the party's standard bearers and launched their campaign in a gathering held in Century Park Hotel in Manila. Duterte and Cayetano kicked off their campaigns with a proclamation rally held in the suburb area of Tondo in Manila on February 9, 2016, the start of the 90-day campaign period for national candidates. The rally was aired on national television through Sonshine Media Network International, the television network of Duterte's friend Pastor Apollo Quiboloy. Duterte and Cayetano went to different places across the country to court people and convince them to be their choices in the May 9 polls. A week before the elections, the Iglesia ni Cristo, known for its bloc voting, announced that they endorsed Duterte's candidacy. = Running mate = Alan Peter Cayetano On September 29, 2015, incumbent Senator Alan Peter Cayetano declared his intention to run for the 2016 Vice-Presidential post in a press event held in Davao City and considered Duterte his first choice as running mate for the presidential post; this eventually led to a meeting between the two parties.Cayetano woos Duterte: We need a real leader ‚Äì ABS-CBN News. A day after meeting with Cayetano, Duterte met with another incumbent senator, Ferdinand \\"Bongbong\\" Marcos, Jr., who also went to Davao City to talk to Duterte. Marcos was reportedly considering running for the Vice-Presidential post as well; Marcos had not yet made any proclamation at that time. As in the Cayetano meeting, Duterte still declared that he was not running for president.Marcos meets with Duterte in Davao City ‚Äì CNN Philippines. On November 21, Duterte decided to join the presidential polls and proclaimed Cayetano as his running mate. Other groups such as Pwersa ng Bayaning Atleta party-list, are supporting the \\"AlDuB\\" tandem (Alyansang Duterte-Bongbong) between Duterte and Marcos.  Political positions  After declaring himself a candidate, Duterte focused his rhetoric on fighting corruption, crime, and drug abuse. He has been described as a \\"populist\\" and \\"socialist\\", positioning himself not just against the ruling party but against the current political system as a whole. His campaign has been heavily supported by older working class Filipinos. = Federalism = Duterte advocates federalism as a better system of governance for the Philippines. He argues that regions outside Metro Manila receive unfairly small budgets from the Internal Revenue Allotment. For example, of the Davao sends monthly to Metro Manila, only ever returns. He also highlights that the money remitted to the national government is misused by corrupt politicians in Congress. = Social policies =  Abortion and contraception issues  Duterte does not believe that contraception is inherently morally wrong and advocates for government-promoted efforts to expand access to contraceptive services. He wishes to maintain laws against abortion in the Philippines, arguing that abortion involves the taking of a sovereign human life.  Conditional cash transfers  Duterte promised that the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program, a conditional cash transfer program started during the administration of former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, would continue if he were elected.  LGBT rights  Duterte criticized boxer Manny Pacquiao after the latter's controversial comments about LGBT couples being \\"worse than animals\\", stating that the boxer did not have the right to judge others in such a manner. Duterte has also advocated in support of anti-discrimination measures to protect LGBT individuals in his capacity as a mayor. He has remarked that, in his view, \\"The universe is ruled by the law of a God who is forgiving, merciful, compassionate and loving, the same God who created all of us equal\\". In terms of the legalization of same-sex marriage, Duterte stated in January 2016 that he feels sympathetic to LGBT people on the issue while still believing that he should not push against the current legal code of the Philippines. He noted that law depicts the matter in terms of religious doctrine and intermingles secular marriage with sacramental holy matrimony, which traditionally is only between one man and one woman. He stressed his feelings of affection for his LGBT friends and family members though indicating his agreement with traditions.  Public order  Duterte stated that he believed that an efficient and effective military and police constituted the most important part of the nation's security. To aid in this goal, he announced that he planned to increase the salary of the military and police to give them dignity and dissuade them from bribe-taking. = Economic policy =  Labor  Duterte opposes \\"labor contractualization\\" and he said that ending it would be one of his priority measures aside from his anti-crime zeal if elected president.  Industrialization  To create jobs, Duterte proposes to build/rebuild industries and their factories. In particular, he believes the most important step towards industrialization is to revive the Philippines' steel industry.  Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program  Duterte opposes any move to amend the Constitution of the Philippines to allow foreigners to own lands in the Philippines.  Taxation  Duterte has said that a monthly income of ‚Ç±25,000 or less should be exempted from income taxes. A simplified tax collection system and privatization of the Bureau of Internal Revenue and other government collection agencies are also among his proposals. However, Duterte has also said he is against income tax reduction.  Foreign investments  Duterte proposes the creation of designated \\"business islands\\" as economic zones to encourage foreign investment and create jobs. To aid in attracting investors, he wants to make economic policies and laws simple and believable. He stresses that travel overseas to find jobs should become a choice rather than continue as a necessity. = Foreign policy =  Chinese activities in the Spratly Islands  Duterte, contrary to current Philippine government policy, has said he is open to bilateral talks with China when it comes to the maritime dispute centered on the Chinese claim to the Spratly Islands. He is supportive of the Philippines' arbitration case against China at the Permanent Court of Arbitration, but has said that a non-confrontational and less formal approach to China would be more effective in coming to an agreement. He has also said that the Philippines should revert to the previous position to agree to explore jointly the disputed areas with other countries like China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan for resources such as oil, gas and other minerals.  Visiting Forces Agreement with the United States  Duterte has said that if Filipinos could not get their fair share in the justice system with the Visiting Forces Agreement and Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, signed between the governments of the Philippines and the United States in 2014, then these agreements should be revoked.  Controversies  = Disqualification cases = A few hours after the COC filing for president of Duterte, radio broadcaster Ruben Castor filed a disqualification petition before the COMELEC against Duterte. On December 21, disqualified presidential candidate Rizalito David of Ang Kapatiran party filed a petition before the commission to declare Duterte's substitution for Di√±o null and void. The legality of Duterte's substitution for Di√±o was questioned by some electoral lawyers because of an error made in Di√±o's certificate of candidacy that made him a Pasay mayoral bet despite being a resident of Quezon City. Because of the issue, rumors circulated that presidential aspirant Miriam Defensor- Santiago was willing to give way for Duterte by letting him substitute for her. However, Defensor-Santiago said that she would not back down from the race even though she has a high regard for Duterte. Another presidential aspirant Roy Se√±eres also opened the possibility he would allow Rodrigo Duterte as his substitute candidate if he will abide in three conditions, particularly being a pro-life advocate. However, Se√±eres later refused to substitute for him and slammed Duterte's decision to pursue the presidency and remarked Duterte should support and endorse him instead. The validity of Duterte's substitution was further assessed by Comelec and on December 7, Comelec rejected a petition to name Martin Di√±o a \\"nuisance\\" candidateComelec junks petition to tag Martin Di√±o as 'nuisance' candidate ‚Äì Inquirer.net. and while the Comelec legal department has assured Duterte that the first COC he filed through a representative was valid, he personally filed his COC at the Comelec national office in Intramuros, Manila on December 8 to formalize his bid for the presidency in the 2016 elections. An estimated 500 people showed up, including students from Duterte's alma mater Lyceum of the Philippines, to express their support.It's official: Duterte seals presidential bid, personally files COC ‚Äì Inquirer.net.Duterte's supporters camp out in front of Comelec ‚Äì CNN Philippines. Voting 6‚Äì1, the COMELEC En Banc approved on December 17 the substitution of Duterte (from Di√±o) as the candidate of the PDP‚ÄìLaban in the 2016 polls. On December 22, JP Delas Nieves, chairman of the UP Diliman University Student Council, filed the third disqualification case against Duterte before the COMELEC. In a decision issued February 3, 2016, the COMELEC's first division unanimously denied all filed disqualification petitions against the presidential candidacy of Duterte due to lack of any merit. The first division also stated that Di√±o is not a nuisance candidate and his substitution to Duterte is valid. = Controversial remarks =  Pope Francis  On December 2, 2015, Duterte received criticism for cursing at Pope Francis because the Pope caused traffic congestion in Metro Manila during his visit in January 2015. He claimed that his outburst was a result of a molestation incident against him by a priest during his childhood. He immediately apologized through the media, saying he was not \\"cursing\\" the Pope but rather the government's way of preparing for the Pope's visit.Duterte curses Pope Francis over traffic during his visit ‚Äì Rappler. Duterte later apologized to the pontiff by writing a letter to Pope Francis dated January 21, 2016. During a campaign rally in Ubay, Bohol, Duterte's camp showed a letter coming from the Vatican's Secretariat of State, signed by Giovanni Angelo Becciu dated February 24, stating that Pope Francis has received his letter and that the Vatican appreciates Duterte's apology after cursing Pope Francis in public.Vatican 'appreciates' Duterte's apology after cursing Pope Francis - CNN Philippines.  Mexico  During a tourism forum that was attended by Duterte, Alan Peter Cayetano, and the Mexican Ambassador to the Philippines, Julio Camarena Villase√±or, Duterte described Mexico \\"as a place where kidnappings and killings are rife and therefore not fit for tourists\\".  Rape of an Australian missionary  On April 17, 2016, Duterte was the subject of controversy after he made remarks about a rape incident during a campaign event about a hostage-taking incident in Davao City which occurred in 1989. A group of 17 Australian missionaries were held captive by inmates in a jail where they were preaching. The incident ended in fatalities with 16 inmates and five missionaries dead, including Jaqueline Hamill, 36, who was also raped. Upon seeing Hamill's corpse, Duterte remarked: The crowd cheered with laughter. The video which recorded Duterte's remark went viral and he was immediately condemned by a wide array of individuals and the Australian Ambassador to the Philippines, Amanda Gorely. Duterte received criticism from a wide variety of sectors, including netizens and the Christian missionary group victimized by the hostage-taking. Presidential candidate Grace Poe called him \\"distasteful and unacceptable\\", while another candidate Mar Roxas said Duterte \\"should not hold power\\", and Jejomar Binay urged voters not to vote for him. Miriam Santiago said Duterte \\"crossed the line\\" with the remark, but also recognized the freedom of expression of Duterte and critics of his remarks. Feminist group GABRIELA Women's Party condemned the presidential candidate saying that \\"rape is a serious crime\\". Duterte later apologized for the incident and acknowledged the comment as a \\"bad remark\\" saying he regretted his \\"gutter language\\" but would not apologize for what he said. He insists though that the remark was not a \\"joke\\" as reported by some media outlets, saying that he stated it in a narrative. He further said that he was not apologizing for stating the remark reasoning that he made the remark out of \\"utter anger\\" when he recalled the events that followed prior to that hostage taking incident. In connection with the rape scandal experienced by her father, Sara Duterte on Monday took to her Instagram account to admit that she was also a rape victim. However, Rodrigo Duterte dismissed his daughter's admission and referred to her as a \\"drama queen\\". Duterte also criticized back the remarks of women's groups. Duterte was also critical of the scathing comments made by American ambassador Philip Goldberg and Australian ambassador Amanda Gorely on his remark on the rape incident. Duterte urged Australia and the United States to cut out ties with the Philippines if he was elected president in response to the ambassadors' critical comments.  People with disabilities and senior citizens  In one of his campaign rallies, Duterte made a joke about a friend who is physically disabled and a senior citizen. He implied that because of their condition, his friend should just commit suicide. This was met with criticism from disabled rights advocates. = Annulment psychological report = An alleged report states his annulment from Elizabeth Zimmerman was caused by his alleged narcissistic and anti-social personality disorder. The report also alleges that his violent behavior and his womanizing attitude was the cause of the annulment. = Alleged links to the Communist Party of the Philippines = The administration of Benigno Aquino III warned voters that they should be alarmed that Duterte may be involved with the Communist Party of the Philippines and its militant wing the New People's Army. This was a day after captive police officers was released by the militants to the mayor. Exiled NPA founder Joma Sison was a former teacher of Duterte and spoke kindly of his former student, having previously endorsed his candidacy. = False Singapore Prime Minister endorsement = In April 2016, a picture of the Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Hsien Loong, captioned with the sentence that \\"Mayor Rodrigo Duterte is the only presidential candidate that could make Philippines like Singapore\\" was circulated on social media. This caused the embassy of Singapore in the Philippines to reject the supposed endorsement as \\"untrue\\" and 'mischievous'. The embassy elaborated: \\"Singapore does not endorse any candidate. The choice is for Filipinos alone to make.\\" Later, the embassy requested the \\"misleading\\" post be taken down, and was seeking \\"legal advice\\". On April 30, 2016, Duterte, speaking at a rally, recalled how he protested in 1995 against Singapore's execution of Flor Contemplacion, a Filipino, for a double homicide. Duterte admitted directing an expletive at Singapore and saying in 1995: \\"Find me a flag of Singapore. Let's burn it.\\" Duterte did burn the Singapore flag in March 1995, joined by 1,000 employees of Davao City. Later, Duterte's spokesman, Peter Tiu Lavina, said that for \\"calling for investigation\\" of a \\"trivial matter\\", Singapore \\"has tasted its own dose of medicine when Duterte retorted jokingly that he will burn the Singaporean flag again. It's a tit-for-tat.\\" = Alleged hidden wealth = On April 27, 2016, vice presidential candidate Antonio Trillanes claimed that Duterte had a bank account worth ‚Ç±211 million that he did not declare on his legally mandated statements of assets and liabilities. Duterte said that Trillanes was trying to get attention to improve his ratings in surveys, which were poor. Alan Peter Cayetano, Duterte's running mate, said that it was just a smear campaign against Duterte and accused Trillanes of doing this under the orders of presidential candidate Grace Poe, who denied any involvement. Both Jejomar Binay and Mar Roxas criticized Duterte for failing to sign a waiver and reveal the contents of the accounts. On April 29, Miriam Defensor Santiago joined in attacking Duterte about the alleged contents of bank accounts. On April 28, Duterte agreed that he had BPI accounts but said he would not issue a waiver because the bank said it could not certify something that did not exist in the first place. He also challenged Trillanes to name his source and file an affidavit to legalize his accusations. Documents from Antonio Trillanes claim that the Duterte political family owns properties around Davao City, elsewhere in Mindanao and also in Metro Manila, none of which were revealed by the mayor in his statement of assets and liabilities and net worth. However, Duterte assumed that all the documents provided were falsified. He also questioned the timing of the accusation because they came less than two weeks before the election. On April 30, the Bank of the Philippine Islands said that there were no such breach or any illegality found in the account. Duterte showed a certificate showing his balance at P17,816.98 as of March 31, 2014, three days after the supposed day of PHP200 million deposits. However, the certificate did not include transaction history of the account that covers the date where the deposits happened. When pressed on why they won't show the transaction history or the balance as of the date in question (March 28), Duterte laid the blame on the bank on not certifying something which is non-existing, perhaps, the account was not yet opened prior to that date. = Authoritarian tendencies = Some allege that Duterte plans to establish a \\"revolutionary government\\" similar to a dictatorship. Duterte has said that he will close the Congress of the Philippines if it tries to impeach him. A religious leader, Apollo Quiboloy, supporting Duterte says that there will be a \\"revolution.\\" Duterte has said that he plans to pardon himself for mass murder, as well as issue additional pardons to policemen and soldiers accused of abusing human rights.  Endorsements   Senate slate  PDP‚ÄìLaban announced on February 15, 2016 that the Duterte-Cayetano tandem would not have a Senatorial slate so that the party could concentrate on promoting the tandem to gain \\"portability.\\" Previously, Senatorial candidates were free to claim that they were part of the tandem's senatorial slate and have appeared in the duo's campaign rallies. Senatorial candidates may still make an appearance in the campaign rallies of Duterte and Cayetano to speak depending on availability but PDP‚ÄìLaban clarified that there won't be any endorsement to any person running for Senator.

Arbuckle is a fictional character from the Garfield comic strip by Jim Davis. He has also appeared in the animated television series Garfield and Friends, the computer-animated The Garfield Show, and two live- action/computer-animated feature films. A geeky and clumsy man yet caring owner, Jon is the owner of Garfield and Odie. Fictional biography Jon's birthday is July 28, as Jon told Garfield that he was 29 years old in a December 23, 1980 strip. However, in the episode \\"T3000\\" of The Garfield Show, he is described as 22. In the animated show Garfield and Friends, it's learned that Jon has an Italian ancestor whose name was Tony Arbuccli. Some episodes of the show suggested that Jon and his pets live in Muncie, Indiana. Jon wears contact lenses, his eyes are green,When his irises are shown. For example, in the July 18, 2010 Sunday strip. and his favorite music style is polka. Jon believes in God, as he is seen praying before going to bed in the April 29, 1987 strip. His personal will states that he wishes to be cremated and have his ashes spread over his accordion. He can play accordion, bagpipes, guitar, banjo, and bongos and sing, though his singing and musical skills are not the greatest. Jon Arbuckle's favorite color is red, and he likes decaffeinated coffee, chocolate-chip cookies, and unleaded gasoline. According to one episode of Garfield and Friends, some of his \\"fun\\" ways to cure boredom are buying new socks, clipping his toenails, or playing \\"Guess the Burp\\" with Garfield. Jon was raised on a farm and occasionally visits his mother, father, grandma, and brother Doc Boy (Which Jon's brother hates to be called), who live on the farm. Jon acquired Odie when Lyman, an old friend of his (and Odie's original owner), moved in with him and Garfield. After a few years, Lyman disappeared from the strip, never to be heard from again. The book Twenty Years and Still Kicking, which marked Garfield's twentieth year, included parodies of how Lyman left, such as \\"Had lunch with Jimmy Hoffa and then...\\". Lyman does appear in an episode of The Garfield Show, during which Jon sets out to look for him. Odie goes back to Lyman, but returns to Garfield at the end. Jon has a long-time crush on Garfield's veterinarian, Dr. Liz Wilson. Although she has a deadpan, sardonic persona, she finds Jon's outlandish and goofball behavior endearing on occasion. Jon often attempts to ask her out on a date, but rarely succeeds, usually with Garfield making fun of his failure; however, in an extended story arc from June 20 to July 29, 2006, Liz finally admitted she was in love with him and became his girlfriend from that point onwards. As early as 1982, Davis had suggested he would eventually bring Jon and Liz together as a couple. Despite his somewhat timid and honest nature, Jon is sometimes shown to be quite assertive on Garfield And Friends. He also shows a tendency to be a miser, as Garfield mentions how Jon passes out seeing the rates on a parking meter and Jon tries to perform an appendectomy on himself to save money. Jon was voted number one on the Best Week Ever blog's list of \\"The Most Depressed Comic Book Characters\\".Best week ever blog Jon also dresses in snappy outfits whenever he goes out on a date. It is briefly mentioned in one strip where Jon mentions that Liz called him a \\"fashion emergency\\". In a May 2006 strip, when he asks Garfield if his tie is too big, Garfield replies \\"Not at all, as long as your circus friends don't object, neither do I!\\" In a June 2006 strip, Garfield laughs at his outfit, and when Jon asks what he is laughing at, Garfield replies, \\"Oh, my...where to start...where to start...\\". In a January 2002 strip, Garfield mentions that two hundred moths committed suicide after seeing Jon's wardrobe. Also, on the Halloween 2014 strip, Jon was scared of a monster hiding in his closet. Garfield said not to worry because his wardrobe will kill it. In the first strip, Arbuckle is presented as a cartoonist. Garfield and Friends also shows him several times as a cartoonist. His occupation is likely still that of a cartoonist on The Garfield Show, as in the episode \\"Family Picture\\" he draws a sketch of a photograph that he wants to take as Liz's birthday present. Also, in the strip from May 2, 2010, Liz tells her parents Jon is a cartoonist. Jon was also seen doing his work briefly in the August 2, 2015 strip. Many of Arbuckle's character traits are shared with his author Jim Davis, who was likewise a cartoonist, raised on a farm and born on July 28. Other media Breckin Meyer portrays Jon Arbuckle in the feature film adaptations. * Jon's first animated appearance was in the 1980 CBS special, The Fantastic Funnies, when he was voiced by Thom Huge. Jon was voiced by Sandy Kenyon in the first animated television special (Here Comes Garfield), before Huge returned to the character in all later specials and in Garfield and Friends. Breckin Meyer portrayed Jon in the live-action/computer animated films Garfield: The Movie and Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties. In Garfield Gets Real, Garfield's Fun Fest and Garfield's Pet Force, he was voiced by Wally Wingert. Wally also provides Jon's voice for The Garfield Show. * In an episode of Futurama, the forehead of a giant \\"Jon\\" balloon from the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade becomes a hot air balloon to raise Fry, Leela, and Bender to the surface world. * Arbuckle: Garfield through Jon's eyes is a daily webcomic in which fans send a redrawing of a Garfield strip with Garfield's thought bubbles removed. * Similarly, Garfield Minus Garfield removes all the other characters completely and simply features Jon talking to himself. Fans connected with Jon's \\"loneliness and desperation\\" and found his \\"crazy antics\\" humorous; Jim Davis himself called Dan Walsh's (the author of Garfield Minus Garfield) strips an \\"inspired thing to do\\" and said that \\"some of the strips work better than the originals\\". * An Arbuckle Thanksgiving and An Arbuckle Christmas have taken the two holiday video specials and digitally removed Garfield and Odie, leaving Jon as the lead.

Advertisers strategically unveil major marketing campaigns in conjunction with televised mega-events and create memorable advertising content with high entertainment value. Some mega-event advertising, such as during the Super Bowl, even attracts a subset of viewers interested primarily in the advertising content. This type of advertisement is an increasingly common television phenomenon as televised mega-events become more popular and available globally. Origin In response to the high production costs of early television, broadcasters envisioned a business model much like the successful radio broadcasters of the time. This led the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to permit commercial advertising on television broadcasts in May 1941. The first television advertisement, a very brief advertisement for Bulova watches, aired on July 1, 1941 before a baseball game between the Brooklyn Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies. Broadcast mega-events, particularly by radio, were not uncommon prior to the widespread adoption of television as a form of home entertainment. However, the affordability of television sets and other technological barriers kept television mega-events relatively uncommon until at least the 1950s and 1960s. As the entertainment value of televised mega-events increased with the addition of improved picture resolution, audio and production quality, so did viewership and the opportunity to reach large audiences. Simultaneously, television advertisements developed into increasingly sophisticated, persuasive and targeted forms of communication. Many of the earliest and most notable television mega-event advertisements are associated with the Super Bowl, but other similar mega-events such ESPN‚Äôs X Games have become in part defined by the advertising backdrop that accompanies them. Definition Television mega event advertising is commercial television advertising content designed and produced to be launched or solely aired in conjunction with a televised mega- event. Although there is no specific guidelines that defines a mega-event, the British Library provides us with the following: ‚ÄúAlthough mega-events each have their peculiarities, they also share a number of characteristics: for example they are transient, but often of great economic and cultural significance; they employ drama and spectacle to underline and promote values of local, national or international importance, and they throw light on the societies, institutions and elites who are involved with them.‚Äù From the British library: mega-events M√ºller (2015) pointed out four dimensions of mega-events definition, they are: visitor-attractiveness, mediated reach, costs and trans-formative impact. Examples =Sporting Events= Televised sporting events, especially mega events such as the Super Bowl or NCAA Basketball Playoffs are attractive to advertisers since these events are mostly watched live, eliminating effects of Digital Video Recorder (DVR) and streaming. This allows advertisers to directly target their consumer demographic, usually 18-30-year-old males. In 2012, 13.3 billion dollars was spent on televised sports advertising, which amounted to 23% of total money spent on TV advertising in the US. The top sporting mega event is the Super Bowl, which was watched by approximately 111 million people in 2014. The NFL decides on advertising content and has contracts in place with companies to provide exclusivity in advertising, eliminating ads placed by competitors. This allowed the league to charge up to 4.2 million dollars for a thirty- second spot in 2014. Another example of a sporting mega event is March Madness, which CBS recently paid 10.8 billion dollars for the television rights. Unlike the Super Bowl which is a single event, the NCAA Tournament spans three weeks in March and televises 65 games. The total advertising revenue for CBS and its cable partners was over 1.1 billion dollars in 2014 with thirty second spots costing upwards of 1.4 million dollars for the championship game. These sports events have benefits of improving national branding image, especially for emerging nations. Positive political and economic impacts on the developing areas have gained more and more attention by governments. =Pop Culture Award Shows= Televised events such as the Academy Awards, the Grammys, and People‚Äôs Choice Awards often pull in large advertising revenues. The mega event of these shows is the Academy Awards. The average rate of a thirty-second spot seen during the Academy Awards was 1.9 million. When calculated as advertising dollars per viewer, advertisers pay 12% more per viewer for the Academy Awards than for the Super Bowl. Recent surveys show that the percentage of Academy Award viewers were more likely to buy products seen during ads placed in the Academy Awards, compared to the Super Bowl (31.1% to 6.9% respectively). The premium paid by advertisers to the Academy Awards is also due to more of a targeted demographic (more affluent females), less competition and more category exclusivity. =TV Series= While advertising rates on hit TV series such as The Walking Dead can be higher than televised sporting events such as Monday Night Football, advertisers want to be a part of historic pop culture events such as iconic TV series finales. The huge ratings these shows garner results in skyrocketing ad rate increases. For example, the finale of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart resulted in a five-fold increase in rates with a thirty-second spot costing as much as $250,000. Furthermore, advertisers were required to purchase ads to run across the entire Comedy Central Network leading up to the finale at a cost of 1-2 million just to have the opportunity to purchase spots in the finale itself. While other TV series finales such as Breaking Bad charged as much as $300,000 for a 30-second spot, this is dramatically less than rates on broadcast TV finales. For example, the series finales of Friends, Seinfeld and Everybody Loves Raymond charged $1 million to $2 million for 30 second spots. The most watched TV series finale of all time was M*A*S*H, which was viewed by over 105 million viewers in 1983. The rate for 30 second ads for the M*A*S*H finale was $450,000. Cost/Value =Cost= Super Bowl ads in 1967 were sold for at $37,000 for a 30-second ad. For comparison, 30 second television advertising spots in the 2014 Super Bowl sold at up to $4 million. This reflects increased competition of national and international level brand names as well as developing interest and demand among viewers for television broadcast mega-events. The cost of mega event advertising spots are determined to some degree by the costs the network paid to air the event and generally, like regular advertising time, are sold on a first-come, first-served basis. However, prices can increase with increasing advertiser demand. Advertisers may pay additional for specific demands such as placement of their advertisement at a specific point during the progression of an event or at the beginning or end of an advertising break when viewers are more likely to be attentive to what is being advertised. Certain events also allow sponsors the right to brand themselves as \\"exclusive\\" event sponsors in television and print media for an additional charge. In general, advertisers are advised to divide television advertising budgets so that approximately 20% is used to secure a spot and the remaining 80% is used to develop the content of the advertisement. Networks may also offer advertising time packages in which much less desirable advertising time spots are offered in a package with the premium time spots that advertisers want. This allows networks to fill advertising space more cost effectively. =Value= Whether or not the inflated cost of television mega-event advertising offers real value to advertisers is up for debate. While mega events offer a significant opportunity to connect to potential customers, the cost of mega event advertising also represents a significant risk. In addition, measuring the impact of television mega event advertising can be problematic. Television ratings, or Nielsen Ratings which measure television broadcast viewership size and composition, have several disadvantages when compared to newer forms of media such as streaming internet, pay-per-views and smart phones. Technological Impacts There have been several technological advancements and innovations in recent years which have greatly impacted TV advertising. One of the most significant is the DVR which promises the ability to ‚Äúskip‚Äù advertisements for their customers. Since its introduction in 2003, the number of devices and its use has greatly increased which common wisdom might suggest would spell the demise of TV advertisement in all but live events. The term most commonly used with DVR‚Äôs ability to skip commercials is referred to as ‚Äúzipping.‚Äù The ability to zip through unwanted commercials to enjoy the recorded programs was seen so negatively that in 2006 major networks acceded to advertisers to only use live ratings as currency when setting prices for TV advertising space. The primary justification for advertisers was the notion that recorded advertisements had no value due to advertising avoidance. An important discussion often ignored was the fact that viewers have been avoiding TV advertisements since their invention. One such way was to switch to another channel, or ‚Äúmultitask‚Äù by having conversations with others, leave the room, mute the TV, or more recently, zip through the commercials in a recorded program. While studies have shown commercials tend to lose 59% to 75% of the audience in recorded programming there is still residual value during the zipped commercials. The three major reasons zipped ads may still be effective include: heightened attention, latent effects, and effects of time compression. While fast forwarding or zipping through commercials on a Video Cassette Recorder or DVR, one must pay close attention to the TV in order to know when to when the show resumes. This intense awareness resulted in about 15% to 59% retention of the commercials zipped. The second reason zipped commercials may have value is due to the latent effects they cause. For example, many people only need to have a glimpse of the golden arches or a silver apple to understand their meaning. Finally, the effects of time compression can have positive effects on consumers. Many studies have shown increased effectiveness in radio and TV commercials with moderately increased time compression. They can both have recall effects and boost prior learning effectively functioning as a reminder advertisement.

The two- times-great-grandson of King Sithu II founded Toungoo near the end of the Pagan Empire in 1279. He became one of several independent rulers of petty states after the empire's breakup in 1287. He later submitted to Myinsaing, the new power in Upper Burma. Thawun Gyi was assassinated by the men of his younger brother Thawun Nge in 1317. Early life Thawun Gyi was the elder son of Thawun Letya, the ex-governor of Kanba Myint () and Kya-Khat-Wa-Ya () (both in modern Taungoo District). He was born after 1256. According to the regional chronicle Toungoo Yazawin, he was born in Pyu where his father had been placed under house arrest since 1256 by a rival governor from a Mon state to the south,Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 17 which most likely was Pegu (Bago).The chronicle Toungoo Yazawin does not mention the exact name of the rival governor or the exact state over which he ruled. But he was most probably Governor of Pegu, not the rebellious Gov. Nga Shwe of Martaban, who per (Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 340‚Äì341) was in revolt for the first three years of Narapati's reign: (1) Pegu was the immediate Mon-speaking state to the south of Kanba Myint; (2) Chronicles do not say that the rebellion spread farther north to Dagon or Pegu; per (Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 340‚Äì341), the Pagan army began the Martaban campaign from Dagon; (3) Even after the Martaban rebellion was put down in 1259, Thawun Letya remained confined to Pyu until his death in 1279. Thawun Letya would likely have been restored to office if the arresting governor were Shwe of Martaban. The fight between the rival governors took place during a brief interregnum following the death of King Uzana of Pagan (Bagan) May 1256. At the capital Pagan (Bagan), a power struggle broke out between Crown Prince Thihathu and his half-brother Narathihapate. The court- backed Narathihapate emerged winner by November 1256.Than Tun 1964: 134Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 337‚Äì338 Since Thawun Letya remained under house arrest until his death in 1279, he may have backed Thihathu. At Pyu, Thawun Gyi and his younger brother Thawun Nge grew up listening to their father's constant reminders about their royal descent from King Sithu II of Pagan‚Äîthe two brothers were two-times-great-grandsons of Sithu II‚Äîand their rightful claim to the Kanba Myint region, which was given in fief to their ancestor Ananda Thuriya by Sithu II. Their father died in early 1279. Per Toungoo Yazawin, his last words to his two sons were to reclaim their rightful land.Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 18 Ruler of Toungoo After their father's death, the two sons along with the followers (370 households) left Pyu for the north.The detention sentence apparently did not apply to the sons. They decided to settle at a location, about 55 km from Pyu and about 40 km south of Kanba Myint. It was named Toungoo (Taungoo) (, \\"Hill's Spur\\") because of its location by the hills in the narrow Sittaung river valley between the Bago Yoma range and southern Shan Hills. The date of foundation was 17 April 1279.Hmannan Yazawin (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 161) says the city was founded on 9th waxing of Kason 641 ME (Thursday, 20 April 1279). Toungoo Yazawin (Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 19) agrees with the date 9th waxing of Kason 641 ME but also says it was a Monday. It means 9th waxing is probably a typographical error. The actual date was probably Monday, 6th waxing (not 9th waxing) of Kason 641 (Monday, 17 April 1279) since Burmese numerals ·ÅÜ (6) and ·Åâ (9) are very similar. Thawun Gyi by primogeniture became the ruler. He was wary of his ambitious younger brother, who coveted the job, but made him his deputy nonetheless.Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 19 He also brought in Kayin Ba, a commoner from the nearby Htihlaing village, into his inner circle, appointing him chief of law enforcement.Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 18‚Äì21 It is not clear if he ever sought or received formal recognition from King Narathihapate. At any rate, within the four years of Toungoo's founding, the kingdom came under the Mongol invasions. By 1287, the country had been broken up into multiple rival centers, with each ruler claiming independence. Thawun Gyi never submitted to King Kyawswa (r. 1289‚Äì97), who ruled only around Pagan. He did submit later at an unspecified date to the Myinsaing rulers who by 1310 had reunified Upper Burma. The royal chronicle Hmannan Yazawin lists Toungoo as a tributary state.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 372, 376 Death Thawun Gyi's end came in 1317. On or right before the beginning of the Buddhist Lent that year (23 June 1317),The Lent began on Full Moon of Waso 679 ME (23 June 1317). As the pagoda was in Toungoo itself, he could have made the trip on the full moon day itself or perhaps a day or two earlier. he was assassinated by the men of Thawun Nge while on his way to the nearby Tayahte Pagoda (modern Myat Saw Nyi-Naung Pagoda) to start his annual pilgrimage. Thawun Nge thought that it was the right time to remove his brother since their overlord King Thihathu of Pinya (not Thihathu of Pagan) was facing a serious rebellion at Sagaing.Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 20 Thawun Nge's calculation proved right. Although Thihathu managed to send an army led by Crown Prince Uzana to retake Toungoo, Thawun Nge quickly submitted to the Pinya forces, and got to keep the governorship.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 372 Notes References Bibliography   * Pagan dynasty Myinsaing dynasty Pinya dynasty 1250s births 1317 deaths ","title":"Thawun Gyi"},{"id":"48614963","title":"The Long Way Home (Show of Hands album)"},{"id":"48614975","text":"Priit Toobal in 2011 Priit Toobal (born 1 November 1983 in Suure-Jaani) is an Estonian former politician of the Estonian Centre Party.

A railroad station was established in Plainfield and began operation in 1909. The local train, Wrightsville and Tennille Railroad, known as the \\"Wiggle and Twist\\" made a daily round-trip from Dublin through Rentz, Cadwell, and Plainfield on to Eastman. A post office opened in 1909, serving until October 5, 2002. A jail was built in 1910 but was destroyed by fire soon after. The Bank of Plainfield operated from 1911 until 1921 and served as the central point of town. A room near the rear of the bank was used as a jail. Plainfield was incorporated by the General Assembly of Georgia on August 7, 1912. The city limits of the town were 1000 yards in every direction utilizing the bank as the center. In 1912 the city council approved a bid to build a town guardhouse, which was accomplished at the total cost of $12.50. A cotton gin and warehouse, built in 1909, operated from 1913 to 1939. Plainfield Baptist Church was organized at a revival meeting held at the Plainfield Warehouse Company June 22, 1913. The church was accepted into the Dodge County Baptist Association in October 1913. The land on which the church is located was donated by the bank president, Dr. E. L. Smith. At the height of its population it had a church, school, drug store, bank, doctors and several stores. In 1920 Plainfield had a population of 1,500. By 1940 the population had dropped to 673. The W&T; rail station closed in October, 1941.

She first appeared in the series twenty-eight episode \\"Bedside Manners\\", broadcast on 3 August 2013. Lily arrives at Holby City hospital to resume her second year of the Foundation Programme. Yu had previously appeared in the show as a separate guest character. She also decided to learn certain medical procedures to make her character believable. Lily is characterised as an ambitious junior doctor and intelligent high- achiever. Lily is good at her job but lacks any \\"bedside manner\\" and her no- nonsense attitude causes problems with colleagues and patients alike. The character was originally working towards a career in dermatology but becomes accustomed to the variety of work the Holby City's Emergency Department has to offer. The character's storylines have focused on themes of bullying at different points of her tenure. Lily is subjected to harsh treatment from her mentor Consultant Martin Ashford (Patrick Robinson). She takes him to a tribunal from which she emerges victorious. Two years later the show switched the roles playing Lily as the bully when she is designated to mentor to junior doctor Alicia Munroe (Chelsea Halfpenny), who resigns from the hospital to escape Lily. The show have also centered a standalone episode around the character, which played her turning into a detective roll to solve two murders and endangering her life confronting the culprit. Yu decided to leave the serial in 2017 and Lily made her final appearance in the eleventh episode of series thirty-two, broadcast on 4 November 2017. The character has been generally well received by critics favouring her sound medical skills and poor bedside manner. But Duncan Lindsay writing for newspaper Metro accused the character of being one-dimensional. Development =Casting and characterisation= Lily was first introduced to viewers via the official Casualty website through a trailer. Three days later the BBC formerly announced her casting and released a series of promotional pictures of Yu on- set and in character. She was billed as a junior doctor with a bad bedside manner who would annoy all of her colleagues. Yu had previously appeared in the show as a guest character Mingmei Ducheng for one episode in 2010. Of her casting Yu stated: \\"It‚Äôs such a privilege to be joining the cast of BBC One‚Äôs Casualty. [...] I am really enjoying all of the medical jargon and being taught the various techniques.\\" Executive producer Oliver Kent said that Lily and fellow new character Rita Freeman (Chloe Howman) \\"hit the ground running and are set to create a stir in the ED\\". The character is introduced during the series twenty-eight episode \\"Bedside Manners\\", broadcast on 3 August 2013. Yu told Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap that her character speaks her mind without giving it any thought. She sometimes regrets her actions but would not admit that she is wrong. Lily believes that you can have anything in life providing you work hard for it. She is not bothered if she is not well-liked because she would rather spend her time learning new skills. Lily is not a character for the \\"easily offended\\" to be around. A BBC Online reporter described her as \\"technically brilliant and is definitely someone you‚Äôd want as your doctor\\". Lily behaves \\"defensive and guarded\\" and Yu believes that her past may have contributed to this. She said that there is more of Lily's life to discover because she is never shown \\"behind closed doors\\" in her home life. In order to make Lily appear like a more realistic doctor Yu learned certain medical procedures. The actress can perform surgical sutures and later learned how to perform a chest drain. Yu has also admitted that she \\"begged\\" the producers to continue to give her character more \\"medical heavy storylines\\". =Early career= Lily begins doing her rounds on the Emergency Department ward and is mentored by Consultant Martin Ashford (Patrick Robinson). Lily spends her first shift trying to link up three unconnected patients' cases together, but her attitude causes an argument with Ash. A Casualty spokesperson told Ellis (Inside Soap) that Lily's attitude during her first day shows that she is not interested in making friends. When she accuses a patient of being unfaithful to their wife Ash cautions her. Lily is shocked and \\"genuinely can't understand what she's done wrong\\". They explained that the character believes that \\"the department needs to be organised better and thats not her problem.\\" Her colleagues make a bet on how long she will last working in the ED wards. Ash invites Lily to accompany him on a life-saving mission. He jumps into a cold dock to save a drowning patient and Lily is in awe. She praises Ash for and reassures him after mistakenly perceiving him to have been hesitant to administer a life saving procedure. Ash is annoyed that a junior doctor would dare to appraise him and verbally abuses her in public. Lily is left \\"mortified\\" by Ash's treatment of her in front of her colleagues. A press officer for the show explained that \\"Lily has a lot to learn about the realities of working in an ED [... it highlights] Lily's total lack of experience in dealing with life-and-death situations in the process. Her harsh bedside manner becomes a concern for Ash who decides to challenge her attitude. He takes action when she ignores his orders over a patient's care and tells her that a patient has died. Yu explained that Ash did so \\"in order to teach her a lesson\\". Lily accuses Ash of bullying her and makes a formal complaint which is taken seriously. Ash is forced to face a tribunal in front of the hospital board and CEO Guy Self (John Michie). Ash is reprimanded for pretending that a patient had died, given a written warning for unprofessional conduct but as What's on TV reported he \\"expresses genuine remorse for the heartache he caused his junior doctor.\\" Following the decision Lily requests that she stays working in the ED department and in surprising scenes Ash voices his support for her to stay. Ben Dowell from the Radio Times announced that Casualty were planning three special stand-alone episodes with dark themes. Accredited actor Gary Lucy had been cast as patient Valentine Kildare for the first episode which also had Lily as the centric character. The episode was billed as a \\"special murder mystery\\" story which sees Lily investigating murders. The episode was also set to an eerie tone with flickering lights and power cuts explained on-screen with electricity generator testing. The show's producer Erika Hossington said she wanted to create a \\"very ghostly place\\" and filming took place during a \\"tiring\\" night shoot. The storyline played out following the death of two patients under unexplained circumstances. Lily treats Valentine and suspects that he is a murderer. Lily had treated the deceased patients and initially questioned her competence following their death. Yu told a What's on TV writer that \\"Lily puts on her detective hat, as she wants to know the truth.\\" She described Valentine as \\"a strange man\\" so it makes a \\"frightening situation\\" for Lily. Lily ends up putting her life in danger when she confronts a corrupt police officer who is responsible for the murders. Yu described it as \\"an amazing scene\\" which was originally written for seven separate scenes until Yu requested it be merged into the single one eventually transmitted. The actress enjoyed the chance to get involved with the unravelling of a big storyline. Lily focuses on her career and does not have time for relationships. She notices that a romance is developing between registrar Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford) and barista Honey Wright (Chelsee Healey). She decides to offer Honey advice to prevent them from getting together. Yu defended her character's actions believing that Lily does not understand \\"romantic love\\" and is unsure of how to deal with it. Yu added that \\"It‚Äôs interesting to see Lily‚Äôs reaction to Ethan and Honey‚Äôs romance. Time will tell if she‚Äôs jealous, supportive or even knows how she feels!\\" When Yu first joined the show she was made to believe that Lily and Ethan would start a relationship, but this never materialised. Producers felt that they did not have romantic chemistry because of the actor's off-set hysterics. Yu thought that Lily was better suited to Ethan's brother Caleb Knight (Richard Winsor) with whom she had once slept with. Yu labelled them \\"both fiercely independent creatures\\". However, Lily continues to pursue Ethan and uses \\"underhand tactics\\" to prevent Honey succeeding. When the character was first introduced she only planned to work in the ED ward for a limited time. She had aspirations to work in dermatology at the end of a five-year-plan. But following eighteen months working at Holby City hospital she changed her career plans. Yu explained that \\"Lily‚Äôs grown up a lot this past year or so working in the hospital. Initially she wanted to leave and go on to dermatology, where she‚Äôd probably make a lot of money, but now I think she‚Äôd miss the adrenaline and variety of her ED job and saving lives!\\" =Bullying Alicia Munroe= Chelsea Halfpenny plays Lily's junior doctor Alicia Munroe.Lily is chosen to mentor new junior doctor Alicia Munroe (Chelsea Halfpenny), but Lily is not impressed with Alicia's popularity and sound medical skills. Halfpenny told Ellis that Lily is \\"an amazing doctor, but struggles to connect with people on a personal level, so I think she's threatened by somebody who can do both.\\" Alicia tries to befriend Lily because she wants to create a fun working environment but her jokes are not well received by Lily. Halfpenny added that Alicia is just \\"desperate\\" to impress her mentor. Lily continues to be critical and confrontational of Alicia whilst claiming only to be trying to attain better performance from her mentee. Alicia saves a patient's life in difficult circumstances outside of the hospital. But Lily dismisses her heroics and launches a verbal attack on Alicia in front of other Emergency Department staff. At the same time Lily had been dealing with the aftermath of her father's sudden death. Yu told Ellis that \\"[we explored] those extreme emotions without worrying about anything else. That scene in resus is an explosion of all the emotions Lily has been feeling - it's just a shame that Alicia is on the receiving end of it.\\" Senior nurse Charlie Fairhead (Derek Thompson) witnesses Lily's behaviour and compares the situation to when Ash was bullying her. Yu believed that Lily felt remorse when she recalled how she had felt. But Lily realises that she has gone too far and \\"it gets to the point where she's way beyond saying sorry.\\" Lily's treatment results in Alicia resigning from her position owing her decision to Lily bullying her. Yu hated being mean to Halfpenny during the filming of Lily and Alicia's clashes because they were friends off-screen. Producer Hossington told Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy that Lily's behaviour was so extreme because she was grieving for her father. Lily also feared that her father died not being proud of her. Hossington added \\"in that time that she felt most vulnerable, she struggled with being faced with someone like Alicia who was so great at what she did.\\" The show had planned the character's comeuppance when her colleagues turn against her. This gave writers the opportunity to explore Lily's character in more depth. She added that the audience could finally \\"see her vulnerability about letting her father down.\\" =Departure= On 31 October 2017, it was confirmed that Yu had decided to leave her role and that her exit scenes would broadcast on 4 November. After being offered a year-long contract in January 2017, Yu declined and told producers she would be leaving, which they understood. She opted to leave to explore new roles and to return to London, her hometown. Yu felt her final episode was her \\"last chance to prove what [she] could do\\". She told Elaine Reilly of What's on TV that Matthew Evans, the episode's director, handled the episode with the \\"sensitivity and compassion\\" that she needed. Yu found her final week of filming challenging and commented, \\"I was trying to be strong and do the Lily Chao defence mechanism, but I was heartbroken.\\" Producers did not kill the character off so she could return in the future. Lily is offered a research position in Hong Kong, but is conflicted about taking it as she would have to end her relationship with paramedic Iain Dean (Michael Stevenson). Yu stated that if Lily was single, she would have \\"leapfrogged over her colleagues\\" to improve her career. She commented that for Lily, \\"leaving definitely isn't an easy decision\\". Lily struggles to end their relationship because she has developed strong feelings for Iain. Despite this, Lily feels that since the return of Iain's former partner Sam Nicholls (Charlotte Salt), she has become second best in his eyes. Lily decides to walk away from Iain rather than stay and have their relationship deteriorate. Yu stated that leaving Iain is incredibly challenging for Lily as she changed herself for him. When Iain tries to prove his love for Lily, he sings karaoke to her. Yu found this scene amusing and struggled to remain in character. As they share a final embrace, Lily reminds herself who she is and tries not to become emotional in front of Iain. Yu explained that Lily wanted to leave with \\"her head held high\\". Reception David Brown (Radio Times) labelled her a \\"spiky new junior doctor\\" who is \\"focused and intellectually fierce \\". Ellis of Inside Soap stated that \\"while we know that Dr Lily Chao's bedside manner leaves a lot to be desired, her treatment of colleague Alicia Munroe has been nothing short of brutal.\\" Their colleague called her a \\"strait-laced doctor\\". Duncan Lindsay writing for newspaper Metro branded Lily \\"a competent doctor\\" but served better as a background character. He believed she was not a likeable enough character to have big storylines. He called her a \\"quite abrasive and spiky\\" character who is \\"largely one dimensional and pretty irritating\\". He also criticised the show for missing opportunities to add depth to the character. A What's on TV reporter branded her a \\"no-nonsense medic\\" character, another opined \\"Doctor Lily Chao is infamous for her cold, clinical demeanour.\\" A writer for The Sentinel branded her \\"the somewhat brusque doctor Lily\\". They criticised her stating \\"The fresh-faced Lily had arrived at Holby believing she knew it all already. If she'd watched the previous 27 series, she'd know otherwise. One thing Lily should never go near is physiotherapy ‚Äì she's far too adept at rubbing people up the wrong way.\\" A reporter from the Coventry Telegraph branded her a \\"hard-working medic\\". Andrew Watt from the Northampton Herald & Post branded the character a \\"possible future Miss Marple\\".

The community is located at the junction of Georgia State Route 15 and Georgia State Route 102, north of Sandersville. Warthen has a post office with ZIP code 31094. History Warthen was the first settlement erected in Washington County and was founded to be the site of the superior courts and the jail for the county. Warthen was erected as a settlement in 1754. It is located in a coastal plain and once embraced territory from the Cherokee corner. Warthen was an early holder of the Washington County county seat until the seat was transferred to Sandersville in 1796. The Georgia General Assembly incorporated Warthen in 1812. Eventually, the community lost its charter and today it occupies an unincorporated area. Warthen has been declared a historic site, and inscribed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Warthen Historic District. The town of Warthen is home to the oldest hewn log jail in Georgia. This jail was once the confinement space of Aaron Burr in 1804 on his journey to Richmond, Virginia for trial concerning his charges of treason against Alexander Hamilton. Warthen, Georgia is historically known for being part of Washington County's cotton crops. The industry of cotton brought settlers to the area and farmers raised a variety of crops. After the invention of the cotton gin, cotton became a major crop in the county. Religion was important in the early community. Baptists and Methodist founded churches by 1865, and then Catholic and Episcopal denominations formed churches some time around 1900. Bethlehem Baptist Church is the oldest Baptist church in Washington County and was one of the first churches to be founded, with its founding taking place in 1790.

He championed the efforts to eradicate the invasive prickly pear. Life and times Johnston was born in 1881 at Balmain, Sydney, Australia the son of Thomas Johnston, an Irish-born foreman mason, and his Australian-born wife Mary, n√©e McLeod. On 1 January 1907, Johnston married Alice Maude Pearce at Petersham, New South Wales, Australia. On 30 August 1951, he died of coronary thrombosis at Adelaide, South Australia. He was survived by his wife and daughter. His son predeceased him. He was cremated.Cleland, J. B. (1952). Thomas Harvey Johnston. The Medical Journal of Australia. 1(12): 422.Editor. (2009). Johnston, T. Harvey, (Thomas Harvey). Trove. National Library of Australia. Academic career Johnston attended Sydney Teachers College and received the Jones Memorial Medal. He then attended the University of Sydney and earned a BA in 1906, the BSc and MA in 1907 and received the DSc in parasitology in 1911. From 1903 to 1906, Johnston taught at Fort Street Public School. He then accepted a position at Sydney Technical College and from 1907 to 1908 taught zoology and physiology. In 1908, he was appointed assistant director at Bathurst Technical College. In 1909, Johnston accepted a position as assistant microbiologist at the New South Wales Health Department in the Bureau of Microbiology. The next appointment came in 1911, at the University of Queensland as lecturer in charge of the department of biology. In 1919, Johnston was promoted to professor. In 1922, Johnston received an appointment at the University of Adelaide as professor of zoology and remained in that position for the rest of his life. From 1928 to 1934, he held the position as professor of botany. Prickly pear Report of the Prickly-pear Travelling Commission In 1912, Johnston was appointed chairman for a committee, the Prickly-Pear Travelling Commission, formed to investigate control measures for the prickly pear cactus. In 1788, Governor Philip and the early colonists are credited with the introduction of the prickly pear to Australia. The plant came from Brazil to Sydney and the prickly pear grew in Sydney. The plant was introduced for use as an agricultural fence and with hopes to establish a cochineal dye industry. Cochineal dye is the red or carmine dye used to colour the historic British \\"Red Coats\\". The prickly pears spread from New South Wales and caused great ecological damage in the eastern states of Australia. From 1912 to 1914, Johnston travelled abroad with Henry Tryon to study the problem. The team became known as \\"The Prickly Pair\\". Johnston and Tryon successfully introduced Dactylopius ceylonicus, the cochineal insect that was effective in the control of one species of the pear Opuntia monacantha.Johnston, Thomas Harvey and Tryon, Henry.

In 1920 Johnston was appointed controller of the Commonwealth prickly pear laboratories. During 1920 to 1922, Johnston travelled overseas yet again to seek a solution to the prickly pear problem. Johnston travelled from Sydney to Java, Ceylon, Europe, the US, Mexico and South America. Efforts had been made before to introduce the insect Cactoblastis cactorum in 1914, and it did feed on the prickly pear but would die out in 1921. In 1924, the insect Cactoblastis cactorum was reintroduced, this time with success and destruction of the prickly pear.Johnston, T. H. (1921). Biological control of the prickly- pear pest.

He was a frequent and prolific contributor of new material to the collections of the South Australian Museum. In Queensland, he conducted studies in diverse areas as cattle tick, blowflies, muscidae, onchoceriasis and fish epidemics. Working with John Burton Cleland he studied worm nests in cattle due to Filaria gibsoni.Cleland, J. B., & Johnston, T. H. (1910). Worm nests in cattle due to Filaria gibsoni.

Some years later, Johnston worked with Thomas Lane Bancroft's daughter Jo, Mabel Josephine Bancroft, and investigated parasites in freshwater fish in the rivers near Queensland and described several new species of sporozoans. Johnston and Bancroft noted in the paper that the specimens were identified by James Douglas Ogilby of the Queensland Museum and as tribute for these efforts names one of the parasites, Myxosoma ogilbyi, in his honour.Johnston, T. H., & Bancroft, M. J. (1919). Some new sporozoan parasites of Queensland freshwater fish. In Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales. (52): 520‚Äì528.

H., & Bancroft, M. J. (1921). The Freshwater Fish Epidemics in Queensland Rivers. Proceedings of the Royal Society of Queensland. Royal Society of Queensland. Later at the University of Adelaide, Johnston published with Patricia M. Mawson, daughter of Douglas Mawson, work on nematodes that included descriptions of new species found in freshwater fish of Australia.Johnston, T. H., & Mawson, P. M. (1947). Host-Parasite List.

From 1916 to 1917, he was president of the Queensland Field Naturalists' Club. He was a founding member of the Great Barrier Reef Committee and a member of the Australian National Research Council until his death. In 1929, Johnston was invited by Douglas Mawson to serve as chief zoologist with the British Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition.Hale, H. M., & Johnston, T. H. (1941).

Individual artists such as Margot Fonteyn, Wayne Sleep and Rudolf Nureyev used the smaller spaces to privately fine-tune their performances. The venture was inspired by Valerie's fascination with ballet. As an art-student Valerie bought student tickets for The Royal Opera House top gallery so that she could see the great Russian dancers take command of the aging stage. Subsequently, Valerie became fascinated by modern dance and especially American jazz which was championed in those days by Matt Mattox.Wayne Sleep \\"The Dance Centre\\" Other teachers who quickly found the facilities helpful include Gillian Gregory, Diana South, and Mike St.Leger Arlene Phillips, Lindsay Kemp, Molly Molloy and Gary Cockrell. Many of the dance students themselves went on to successful careers, for example David Bowie, who cites Lindsay Kemp's mime classes as being a fundamental inspiration for the character Ziggy Stardust, and Kate Bush. By the mid-1960s, the Dance Centre was a Covent Garden Landmark. At that time virtually all the other buildings in Floral Street were vegetable or fruit warehouses. In fact the Dance Centre itself had previously been a banana-drying warehouse and before that it was a poor school. As a listed three-storey building, the bell- tower can still be seen rising above the other Floral Street retail units. The fruit and vegetable market was established in the 1600s as a growing area literally annexed to a convent; hence the name. Eventually many west-end and national shows auditioned there and rehearsed there too. The Dance Centre also operated its own leading theatrical agency under Rob Gardell. It commissioned its own ballet shoes, tights, leotards and leg-warmers. The idea of such brand extension was pioneering in its day. It also created its own dance troupes called The Beat Girls, later to become Pan's People. In 1971, theatre producer Ian Albery asked The Dance Centre to help rent its warehouse (just around the corner in Earlham Street) to theatrical companies. So successful was The Dance Centre in reviving this space that the warehouse thrived and became The Donmar Theatre. Valerie Tomalin's business partner Gary Cockrell opened The Sanctuary next door at number 11 Floral Street, and Valerie opened The Costume Centre in King Street in the centre of Covent Garden just by the piazza.

History The Skyline Hotel was designed in the brutalist style by the Ronald Fielding Partnership,https://www.architecture.com/image-library/ribapix/image- information/poster/skyline-hotel-heathrow-airport- london/posterid/RIBA78692.html with interiors by Canadian designer Allan W. Edwards.http://www.hotelymir.com/page7.html The Skyline Hotel, along with the Park Tower Hotel in Knightsbridge, was developed by Capital & Counties and both properties were operated by Canadian-based Skyline Hotels. The Skyline Hotel opened on 1 October 1971, with a single room price of ¬£6 and double- rooms priced at ¬£9. That same year the hotel formed part of a group called the London Heathrow Conference Service with most of the major hotels in the area, to specifically target business travelers and \\"become the business meeting centre of Europe\\". From the outset the hotel became known for hosting numerous international business conferences. On 9 March 1977, the \\"Transport of hazardous cargoes by air\\" conference was held at the hotel. During the 1970s, entertainment at the hotel included Diamond Lil's Wild West Cabaret, which ran up to six nights a week, and the house band The Banjo Boys. Sheraton Hotels acquired the management contract for the Skyline Hotel and the Park Tower from Skyline Hotels for a combined ¬£4 million on May 14, 1977, and the hotel was renamed the Sheraton Skyline Hotel.https://newspaperarchive.com/north-adams- transcript-may-14-1977-p-16/ In 1980 the Turkish Cypriot business community met at the hotel to discuss trade and investment between Turkey and the UK. In 1981, John Rotter was appointed controller of the Sheraton Management Corporation and controller of the Sheraton Skyline Hotel. In 1988, Swedish property development consortium Reinhold Int bought the hotel for nearly ¬£40 million. At the end of 1996, the hotel completed the Department of National Heritage's certification in the Investors in People Program, which rates the performance of employers in the hospitality industry. The certification marks employers who have high training and incentive programs for employees in one of Britain's fasted-growing employment sectors. The Sheraton Skyline was one of the venues for the first four days of the Congress in London, held between 4 and 11 July 1997. For a period it was known as the Sheraton Skyline Hotel and Conference Centre. In May 2002, hundreds of people were evacuated from the hotel by fire services, after it was reported that guests could smell ammonia. In early November 2007 there was a hit-and-run incident at the hotel when Detective Constable Cathy Corbett, 39, was rundown by a blue Peugeot 207, suffering serious head injuries. The hotel was purchased in 2015 by Qatar Airways. It was announced that the hotel would be renamed Oryx Sheraton Skyline London Heathrow, the first hotel to be branded under the airline's Oryx brand. However the name change was never carried out. Architecture and facilities The Sheraton Skyline was built in 1971 by Curtis and Davies and designed by Ronald Fielding. The hotel is noted for its \\"atrium design\\". The hotel features 350 rooms. The hotel has several restaurants including Madhu's Heathrow, Sports Bar & Grill and the Sky Bar, which serves cocktails. The menu at Madhu's Heathrow features Punjabi cuisine, based on recipes from the original Madhu Indian Restaurant, located in Southall, West London. It is the first branch of the 33-year-old establishment. It previously had a Mediterranean restaurant called The Garden, which overlooked the hotel's swimming pool. A 1983 article in The Law Society's Gazette stated: \\"An earthly paradise appears in the shape of the Sheraton Skyline Hotel at Heathrow, where the chef, Uwe Zander, has a fantastic number of awards\\".

On October 20, 1580, Pope Gregory XIII appointed him Bishop of Panam√° (some sources state that he did not accept the nomination). On June 3, 1583, he was consecrated bishop by Diego de Romano y Govea, Bishop of Tlaxcala (Puebla de los Angeles). As there was no official governor during his term as bishop of Panama, he was instrumental in governing the province with the Audencia Real (high court). He reached out to the Cimarr√≥nes (free blacks) who were living outside of the Crown's jurisdiction and facilitated their incorporation into the colony. In 1581, a treaty was signed between the Cimarr√≥nes which gave them the land which they possessed and allowed them to found and settle the city of Pacora, near Panama City, as a commercial center. He also helped to lessen congestion in Panama City by founding the town of Penonom√© and establishing parishes in Nat√° and Ol√°.

The band members included Vocalist Matthew Tompkins, Bassist Jason Savage, Guitarist Trey Davis, Drummer Matt Boyd, and Guitarist/Drummer Josh Kassinger. The band originally formed in 2003 under the name Downfront but 2004, they changed their name to Cries Hannah. The name change was significant to them because it was taken from the Bible, 1 Samuel 2. During the summer of 2006, the band independently released their EP, Oh, Death Where is Thy Sting. Shortly thereafter, Cries Hannah signed a label deal with Crash Music, Inc, and recorded with Tyler Orr (As Cities Burn, Rookie of the Year, The Chariot) at First Street Studios in Cleveland, TN. The result was their debut album, Beloved... I Caught You When You Fell. Following the release of the album in November 2006, Cries Hannah toured throughout the South and Midwestern United States. In the Spring of 2007, the band was involved in a serious bus accident following a show in Chicago, IL. None of the members sustained serious injuries, though the bus was totaled. That summer the band embarked on what would be their final tour with Here I Come Falling. Following the tour, the band decided to call it quits and pursue their own personal endeavors. Their final shows were concluded in late 2007.

Biography  Rinehart was born in 1960 in Norwalk, Connecticut. Rinehart started his studies of the guitar at an early age, and at the age of 10 he was recruited by a substitute teacher at his elementary school to sing backing vocals for two pieces performed by Judy Collins on a television show. Afterwards, he learned the piano, and played in several rock bands during high school. He subsequently studied music and theatre at Bard College at Simon's Rock, a progressive college which introduced him to his first non-western music forms and instruments. His formal musical education continued when he enrolled in the classical conservatory of the State University of New York where he researched the relationship between rhythm, culture and perception. He graduated in 1992 with his thesis, Rhythm In Culture, given a special merit award. While at the university he formed his own group, Zulife, and backed regular CBGB‚Äôs headliners Being Don And Nothingness. He has analogised the purpose of his songs as similar to that of ‚Äòminstrels in medieval Europe, or the griots of West Africa‚Äô. His interests grew from singer-songwriters such as Joni Mitchell to encompass progressive and hard rock groups including Genesis and Led Zeppelin. By the early 1980s he was attuned to what he termed ‚Äòmore dramatic‚Äô music, including Talking Heads and Laurie Anderson, as well as Celtic folk from the Chieftains and traditional music from eastern Europe, Africa and India. He subsequently attended the California Institute of the Arts to study African and Indian music full-time. After a year spent hitchhiking in 1982 he returned to California to undergo a luthier apprenticeship, enabling him to work as a journeyman instrument repairer. He also began to build his own instruments, one of which, a mbira, was later employed by Robert Fripp. Having returned to Connecticut in 1984 Rinehart became a studio engineer and played in a number of rock bands. Rinehart got a strong interest in a variety of cultures from growing up in a home filled with diverse musical sounds ranging from classical to pop music. His first album, Walking Home (1988), released on his own record label, received several strong reviews in performers‚Äô magazines including Guitar Player and Music Technology. With the album Jason‚Äôs Chord (1993) we saw him combine with other established musicians including guitarist David Torn (a Windham Hill Records recording artist known from Everyman Band), bass player Mick Karn (known from Japan) and former Bruce Springsteen / Van Morrison live drummer Kurt Wortmann.

It was purchased by the Benjamin Air Rifle Company in 1977, and later purchased by Crosman in 1994. Company history Sheridan Products Inc. was formed to produce Pneumatic Air Pellet Rifles with production beginning in March 1947. In the early 1940s Co-founder Ed Wackerhagen, dissatisfied with a pellet gun used by his son, set out to build one of the finest airguns in history. The design was to incorporate the philosophy: \\"performance is the sum total of many small functions who's combined result must spell 'Bulls-eye' It was to be called the Model A, also known as the Super Grade. This gun was to fill the gap between the \\"BB\\" gun and the .22. A successful prototype was produced in mid-1944, and in 1945 in partnership with I.R. \\"Bob\\" Kraus, Sheridan Products, Inc. was born in Racine, Wisconsin. The name Sheridan was reputedly in honor of the Civil War's General Philip Sheridan. The Sheridan Model A \\"Super Grade\\" was introduced in 1947 and is considered one of the finest Air rifles ever produced. Unfortunately its high cost (MSRP $56.50), translated to very slow sales. Within a year, it was decided that a cheaper model was needed, and in 1948 the Model B \\"Sporter\\" was born. Designed to be less expensive than the Model A, it had a MSRP of $35 when introduced. Apparently the price point of the Model B was still too high, and sales continue to be slow on both rifles, which was of great concern to the newly formed Sheridan Company. It was quickly realized that for the company to survive, a much cheaper to produce model must be designed. This philosophy gave rise to the last Sheridan model, the Model C \\"Streak\\" introduced in 1949. Its MSRP at introduction was $19.95 and was selling for $23.95 by 1950. This is the model that ushered Sheridan Products Inc. into profitability. The Model C Silver and Blue Streaks are the pellet rifles that Sheridan is primarily known for, since the Model A's and B's are relatively scarce. Sheridan manufactured the Model C Streaks for 27 years before being bought out by the Benjamin Air Rifle company in 1976 and ending the original run of Sheridan produce Streaks. Many small changes were made to the Streaks during its 27-year run, providing collectors many different varieties. Sheridan was purchased by the Benjamin Air Rifle Company in 1977. That company was purchased by Crosman in 1994. Products All Sheridan air rifles Model A, B, and C are multi-pump, single shot, bolt action, breech-loading, and .20 (5mm) caliber. Muzzle velocity figures are for Sheridan's standard weight pellets of 14.3 grains.) Model A (Super) (1947‚Äì1953) Total Production: 2130 Velocity: Variable to 700 fps. With a large cast and machined aluminum receiver, bronzed barrel and pump tube, walnut stock with Monte Carlo cheek-piece, ball-type valve mechanism, adjustable trigger, and peep sight. It weighed 5 pounds 14 ounces, stretched 37 inches overall, with a 20-inch barrel with one turn in 12 inches. MSRP $56.50. Model B (Sporter) (1948‚Äì1951) Total Production: 1051 Velocity: Variable to 700 fps Designed to be less expensive than the Model A (Super) Using the same gun, but without the cheek-piece, a revision of soldered ventilated rib type barrel, less expensive paint finish and various slight changes it was to be a cheaper alternative to the slow selling Model A. MSRP $35 when introduced, $42.50 when production stopped. Model C (Streak) (1949‚Äì1976) Total Production: Unknown. Velocity: Variable to 700 fps. Designed to be less costly to produce than the Model A (Super) and the Model B (Sporter). Although less costly to produce when compared to the Super and Sporter Grade, the Model C were still well constructed Airguns using quality materials. They utilized walnut stocks, aluminum receiver, bronze barrel and pump tube. A different valve mechanism was used in the Model C than in the previous Model A and B. It was dubbed the \\"Streaks\\" with the Silver Streak being first with its Nickel finish, followed by Blue Streak in a black oxide finish in 1952. The only difference between the two Streaks is the finish. MSRP 19.95 at introduction and was soon selling for $23.95 (1949‚Äì50). Sheridan Products Inc was acquired by its competitor, the Benjamin Air Rifle Company in 1977, thus ending the original line of Sheridan Model C's in 1976.(Benjamin Air Rifle Company continued producing Model C's until 1992 when the company was purchased by competitor Crosman Corporation. Changes to the design of the Model C were made by both Benjamin and Crosman.) Model F (1975-1990) Total Production: Unknown. Velocity: Approx. 500fps. 5mm or .20 caliber, single shot, bolt action. Though very similar to the Model C, the Model F is powered via CO2. With a Walnut stock and rocker- type thumb safety, this airgun is a great collector's rifle, known for its accuracy. As previously noted, in 1977 Sheridan Products Inc. was acquired by the Benjamin Air Rifle Co., also ending line of original Sheridan Model F's in 1976.

He is a former British Army lance corporal, Territorial Army officer and police officer who has worked in a number of roles related to border management strategies. He became UKIP leader after winning the party's 2017 leadership election, and gave himself the additional role of Defence spokesman in January 2018. Bolton was removed as party leader in February 2018, following his relationship with a party member, and an ensuing controversy caused over racist comments she had made to a friend about Prince Harry's fianc√©e, Meghan Markle. Bolton's departure triggered UKIP's fourth leadership election in eighteen months. He subsequently announced plans to establish a new political party, to be called OneNation, that would adopt a Eurosceptic stance like UKIP. The party, under the name Our Nation, was registered with the Electoral Commission on 31 October 2018, but de-registered on 4 November 2019. Early life and career Bolton was born in Nairobi, British Kenya, on 2 March 1963. He served in the Royal Hussars from 1979 to 1990, rising to the rank of lance-corporal. After leaving the regular army in 1990, for eight years he was a police constable in the Thames Valley Police, during which time he received an award for outstanding bravery. While serving in the police, Bolton joined the part-time Territorial Army, and in 1992, gained a commission in its Wessex Regiment. Two years later, he was promoted to captain. Following the disbanding of the Wessex Regiment, Bolton served part-time in the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment and the Royal Rifle Volunteers, before leaving the Territorial Army in 2000. \\\\- He left the Thames Valley Police in 1998 to take on overseas security and policing roles, including work for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in hostile environments, including Afghanistan. Bolton was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 2013 New Year Honours \\"for services to international security and stabilisation\\" following his role as a Stabilisation Team Leader for the Provincial Reconstruction Team in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. Political career Bolton stood as the Liberal Democrat candidate at the 2005 general election for the seat of Runnymede and Weybridge in Surrey, but defected to UKIP in 2014, saying that he felt more comfortable in a party that said what it thought. In 2015, he stood as a UKIP candidate for Shepway District Council. Bolton is chairman of the Manston Airport supporters group \\"Why Not Manston?\\", vice chairman of the Remembrance Line Association heritage group and founding member of the Folkestone Heritage, Arts and Tourism Forum. \\\\- Bolton became the Leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) on 29 September 2017. He had previously been the party's candidate in the 2016 election for Kent Police and Crime Commissioner, finishing in second place to Conservative Party candidate Matthew Scott. =Political views= Bolton has said that the effectiveness of policies is more important than whether they are from the left or the right. As a Liberal Democrat he said that being tough on issues of law and order was part of the party's principles. At the launch of his campaign to be UKIP leader, Bolton highlighted his opposition to the practice of female genital mutilation. During his leadership campaign he spoke of Britain's separation from the EU, saying that UKIP has \\"a moral responsibility to make sure Brexit is a success for everybody\\". =Leader of UKIP= In July 2017, Bolton declared that he was standing in UKIP's forthcoming leadership election. He began as a relative unknown in a field of eleven candidates; however, his standing improved as other candidates withdrew, and he received the endorsements of four of the party's MEPs: James Carver, Jill Seymour, Mike Hookem and Ray Finch. \\\\- \\\\- \\\\- \\\\- The former UKIP leader Nigel Farage had acted as his political referee to stand for the leadership. During the campaign Bolton challenged the decision to allow Anne Marie Waters to stand. He said that her candidacy was in violation of the party's rules of procedure as she was not considered to be 'in good standing' due to previous exclusions for elections. He withdrew the challenge when faced with the possibility that it could lead to counter-suits against the party. Subsequently, he was quoted by the press as saying that UKIP was in danger of becoming the \\"UK Nazi party\\" if the wrong candidate were elected as leader. Following his victory he stated that \\"Brexit is our core task\\" while separately declaring Islam a \\"concern\\", though he believed that an anti-Islam agenda would offer UKIP little gain. In recognition of his new role, in October 2017 he was placed at Number 86 in 'The Top 100 Most Influential People on the Right' by commentator Iain Dale. In January 2018, it became known that Bolton had left his wife and embarked on a relationship with Jo Marney, a model and party member nearly 30 years his junior. As a consequence Bolton faced demands from members of UKIP that he stand down as leader. \\\\- On 14 January it was reported that Marney had been suspended from UKIP following allegations that she had sent a series of SMS messages containing racist comments about Prince Harry's fianc√©e, Meghan Markle. \\\\- Her comments also targeted immigrants and Grenfell Tower families. The following day, Bolton announced he had ended his relationship with Marney, but media subsequently reported that the two continued to be seen in each other's company. \\\\- Responding to these reports, Bolton suggested that the controversy would \\"fade away\\". \\\\- On 19 January 2018, MEP Jonathan Arnott announced his resignation from UKIP. In his resignation letter, he stated that he had lost confidence in Bolton, who he felt was \\"not the right person for the job\\" ‚Äì but thought no better of those \\"jockeying\\" for position in the party. On 21 January, the UKIP National Executive Committee (NEC) delivered a vote of no confidence in Bolton; only Bolton voted against the motion. Bolton had made it clear earlier that day that he would not resign if the vote went against him, because he felt another leadership election would destroy the party. Consequently, at the emergency meeting of UKIP's NEC, it was decided that party members would be balloted on whether Bolton should be removed from office, as the NEC does not itself have the power to dismiss the leader. On 22 January, Margot Parker resigned as deputy leader, claiming Bolton had left the party in \\"limbo\\". Immigration spokesman John Bickley, Trade and Industry spokesman William Dartmouth and other spokesmen resigned on the same day. At an extraordinary general meeting held in Birmingham on 17 February, 63% backed a motion of no confidence in Bolton, and he was removed as UKIP leader, a decision that triggered UKIP's fourth leadership election in eighteen months. \\\\- Acting UKIP leader Gerard Batten subsequently suggested that Bolton had left the party. On 22 February 2018, Bolton and Marney appeared as guests on an edition of the ITV daytime magazine programme This Morning where Bolton argued that Marney's Grenfell Tower comments had been taken out of context and that it was important to have a debate about illegal immigration. =Our Nation= On 6 March 2018, Bolton announced his intention to establish a new political party, OneNation, that would \\"campaign unceasingly for our full independence from the EU\\" and that would \\"mirror some of the changes that I sought to bring to UKIP\\". The registration application for OneNation was rejected by the Electoral Commission as \\"likely to mislead voters\\", its name being the same as an existing Islamic relief charity.

Works Henry Bolton is the author of What a State! The book explores what Bolton sees as failures in modern British political leadership, the inadequacies of MPs and challenges of political leadership, Brexit, populism, identity politics, equal representation v equal opportunities and the institutional culture of the civil service. The preface is written by Lembit √ñpik. On 22 September 2019, the electronic version of the book was listed as the No2 bestseller on amazon.co.uk in the subject area of political leadership. Personal life Bolton was divorced from his third wife, the Russian-born Tatiana Smurova in 2018; with whom he has two children. In 2016, Smurova-Bolton gave birth to their second child on a train at St Pancras railway station. The couple separated at Christmas 2017. He also has a daughter, born in 1985, from his first marriage, to Danish national Karin Dohn. Bolton began a relationship with Jo Marney after meeting her shortly before Christmas 2017, and spent Christmas with her after leaving his wife. He claimed to have ended the relationship with Marney after details of her SMS message comments, in which she made overtly racist comments against Meghan Markle, the fianc√©e of Prince Harry, came to light, though the two continued to see each other. Bolton said he had been unaware of Marney's comments. However, during their This Morning appearance following his resignation, Bolton and Marney confirmed their relationship had ended while he sought to keep his office, but that it had since been rekindled. Later, he admitted that the relationship had never actually ended. Peter Walker, \\"Former Ukip leader Henry Bolton still in relationship with Jo Marney\\", The Guardian], 20 February 2018. Retrieved 14 January 2020. Amidst the media attention on his alleged adultery with Marney, Bolton's second wife, Lidia Gouniakova, another Russian national, accused him of having been unfaithful to her too, reportedly having left her for Tatiana Smurova, who became his third wife.

Since 2007, he has been a columnist for the leftist BirG√ºn newspaper. He also wrote for the newspapers Taraf.  Parliamentary career  Ahead of the June 2015 general election, Sancar was asked by HDP leader Selahattin Demirta≈ü, one of his former students, to run for parliament. After some hesitation, he agreed to suspend his academic career in order to help the HDP over the 10% threshold.

Personal life  Sancar is the cousin of the laureate of the 2015 Nobel prize in Chemistry, Aziz Sancar. Sancar considers Arabic his native language, while Kurdish was the language he spoke on the street. Besides these, he speaks Turkish, English and German.

Following the war, the vessel was sold for mercantile use and renamed Ta Lung, operating under a Chinese flag. In 1949, the ship was taken over by the Communist Chinese government, rearmed and renamed Wan Lee. Design and description The Castle class were an improved corvette design over their predecessor . The Flower class was not considered acceptable for mid-Atlantic sailing and was only used on Atlantic convoy duty out of need. Though the Admiralty would have preferred s, the inability of many small shipyards to construct the larger ships required them to come up with a smaller vessel. The increased length of the Castle class over their predecessorsChesneau, p.63 and their improved hull form gave the Castles better speed and performance on patrol in the North Atlantic and an acceptable replacement for the Flowers.Brown 2007, p.142 This, coupled with improved anti-submarine armament in the form of the Squid mortar led to a much more capable anti-submarine warfare (ASW) vessel. However, the design did have criticisms, mainly in the way it handled at low speeds and that the class's maximum speed was already slower than the speeds of the new U-boats they would be facing.Brown 2007, p.127 A Castle-class corvette was long with a beam of and a draught of at deep load.Brown states the beam at and the draught at The ships displaced standard and deep load.Chesneau states the displacement at deep load as The ships had a complement of 120.Brown states the complement as 99 and Johnston states the complement of Canadian ships at 112 (7 officers and 105 ratings).

This was the nineteenth model of British QF 4-inch gun Anti-air armament varied from 4 to 10 Oerlikon 20 mm cannons.Brown 2007, p.126 For ASW purposes, the ships were equipped with one three-barreled Squid anti-submarine mortar with 81 projectiles. The ships also had two depth charge throwers and one depth charge rail on the stern that came with 15 depth charges. The ships were equipped with Type 145 and Type 147B ASDIC. The Type 147B was tied to the Squid anti-submarine mortar and would automatically set the depth on the fuses of the projectiles until the moment of firing.

The ship, named for Hever Castle in Hever, Kent, was laid down on 29 June 1943 and launched on 24 February 1944.Macpherson and Barrie, p.162Colledge, p.154 At some point in 1943, the ship was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy. The corvette, renamed Copper Cliff after a suburb of Sudbury, Ontario, was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 25 February 1944 with the pennant number K495. After working up at Tobermory, Copper Cliff was assigned to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force as part of the escort group C-6 as a convoy escort in August 1944. During a boiler cleaning in September, she was used to test the Type 277 radar. In October, Copper Cliff switched to group C-7 and remained on escort duty for the remainder of the war. In June 1945, Copper Cliff returned to Canada, stopping in Halifax, before continuing on to her final destination of Esquimalt, British Columbia. It was there on 21 November 1945 that Copper Cliff was paid off and placed in reserve. In 1946, Copper Cliff was sold for mercantile use under a Chinese flag and renamed Ta Lung. Converted to a cargo ship, the vessel had a gross register tonnage of 1,305 tons. The ship was renamed Wan Lee in 1947 and was taken over by the Communist Chinese government in 1949.Colledge has the ship renamed Kuang Chou when taken over by Communist China, however, they also have renamed Kuang Chou when that ship was taken over and most other sources agree with that. The ship remained listed until 1968, however, following that the ship's existence remained doubtful even though it was reported on until 1977‚Äì78. Miramar claims the ship was wrecked on 12 April 1948 at .

John Fitch was given the opportunity to test several models of the brand new Corvair during the fall of 1959. He had the cars for two weeks and tested them at the Lime Rock track in Connecticut. During this pre-public tryout, John left enthused with the Corvair's potential as a Grand touring machine with a European flavor. He then set out to develop various engine, chassis and body modifications. John decided to market these modifications and the Fitch Sprint was born. John‚Äôs first Corvair was a 1961 Monza Coup√©. John used this car as the basis to build the first prototype Sprint. Fitch Sprints were available in three different flavors. A customer could have his new Corvair drop shipped to Fitch‚Äôs Falls Village shop and have Fitch‚Äôs mechanics install the Sprint kit options desired. Or, the Sprint kit could be installed by a local Chevrolet dealer who is authorized by Fitch to install the Sprint kit. Fitch recalls that more cars were converted at dealerships than at his shop. And lastly and most popular, you could mail- order the kit and options you desire and install the Sprint kit yourself. Fitch continued producing Sprints until GM pulled the plug and later sold all inventory and tooling for the Sprint to Art Hershberger of Solar Automotive in November 1971. Fitch Sprint Options Options are broken down approximately by year introduced, but be aware that there is some overlap across years. Fitch produced these parts over approximately a ten-year period from 1961 to 1971 until he sold all rights, parts and toolings to Art Hershberger of Solar Automotive. So any year Corvair could have any of the following options that were not early or late model specific. Notable exceptions: Full width stone guard Early models only Black vinyl top Early models only Chrome bow at top of back window Early models only Masked rear window Early models only S P R I N T letters Early models only Custom rear coil springs providing 2 deg. neg. camber Early models only Matching colored vinyl covered glove box door Early models only Hydraulic steering damper (Mercedes type) Early models only SPRINT by Fitch emblem (large) Not used on late venttops Sprint fastback 904 venttop Late models only Aeon rubber spring bumper blocks Late model only Hydraulic steering damper (Delco Stingray type) Late models only  1961 Sprint (Fitch Prototype)  *Prototype 98 bhp w/ 4 speed trans. *Paxton supercharger: Bolt on supercharger kit providing 130 bhp at a higher engine speed.

Forming from a tropical depression on July 4, Dennis began impacting Haiti two days later with heavy rains. Civil authorities and international agencies acted quickly to protect lives, ordering evacuations‚Äîapproximately 1,000 people complied‚Äîand prepositioning emergency supplies. Over the subsequent two days, the hurricane's outer bands continued to impact the nation before effects abated. Widespread flash floods and landslides caused substantial damage, with areas along the Tiburon Peninsula taking the brunt of the impact. A bridge collapse near Grand-Go√¢ve left 15 people dead or missing. All told, Dennis killed 56 people and wrought US$50 million in damage. The nation's government released emergency relief funds on July 7 and international agencies provided considerable assistance to residents in the months after the storm. World Concern aided roughly 18,000 residents and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies assisted approximately 4,000 people. Background and preparations On July 4, 2005, the National Hurricane Center classified a tropical depression near the Windward Islands. This system moved briskly to the west-northwest, becoming Tropical Storm Dennis the following day. Taking advantage of highly favorable environmental factors, such as low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures, Dennis rapidly intensified. By July 6, the system reached hurricane strength as it began traversing the Jamaica Channel. Around 12:00 UTC on July 7, the hurricane passed 85 mi (140 km) southwest of Les Cayes with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (160 km/h)‚Äîa Category 2 on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. The system subsequently struck Cuba as a Category 4 twice before moving over the Gulf of Mexico. It ultimately moved inland over Florida as a Category 3 on July 10 and dissipated over the Great Lakes eight days later. Within hours of Dennis becoming a tropical storm on July 5, the Government of Haiti issued a tropical storm watch for areas between Port-au-Prince and the Haiti‚ÄìDominican Republic border. This was soon replaced by a hurricane watch and tropical storm warning spanning the entirety of the nation's Tiburon Peninsula. Owing to the cyclone's proximity, this was further increased to a hurricane warning on July 6\\\\. Advisories were discontinued early on July 8 as Dennis traversed Cuba and no longer posed an immediate threat to Haiti. On July 6, Haiti's National Meteorological Centre (le centre national de m√©t√©orologie; CNM) advised residents in elevated, exposed locations to evacuate due to the threat of winds in excess of . At least 300 people were relocated from J√©r√©mie. They also forecast rainfall accumulations between , leading to the threat of flooding and mudslides. Furthermore, small seagoing craft were urged to remain at port. Local media noted that the nation was particularly vulnerable to disasters with numerous homeless people inhabiting slums around Port-au-Prince in the wake of catastrophic flooding from Hurricane Jeanne in September 2004. At the time of Dennis's arrival, approximately 550,000 people were receiving assistance from the World Food Programme. The Haitian National Red Cross Society mobilized 300 personnel and identified ten potential shelters in the threatened region. At least 700 people utilized these shelters in Les Cayes, Port-Salut, and the Grand'Anse. The Pan American Disaster Response Unit branch of the International Federation of Red Cross And Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) was equipped with supplies for 10,000 people and prepared to deploy. Impact The outer bands of Hurricane Dennis began impacting Haiti on July 6, flooding multiple roadways. Although no official observations were relayed to the NHC, sustained tropical storm-force winds are believed to have affected much of the Tiburon Peninsula on July 7. Local media relayed reports of winds exceeding in Jacmel, J√©r√©mie, and Les Cayes on that day. Widespread damage was incurred across Sud department. In Les Cayes, rivers over-topped their banks, high winds felled trees, 34 homes were damaged or destroyed, and the local hospital sustained significant damage. One person was killed and two others were injured when a tree destroyed a home. Flooding across the Ouest department submerged multiple districts, particularly around Petit-Go√¢ve. Several search and rescue missions took place in the commune. In nearby Grand- Go√¢ve, a bridge collapsed after numerous people gathered atop it to view flood waters. At least nine people died as a result with six others reported missing. At least 25 homes were destroyed in the commune. Damage was reported on Gon√¢ve Island, with multiple homes collapsing. Throughout Grand'Anse, roughly 1,500 families were rendered homeless, 675 of which required urgent aid. During the storm, commune of Beaumont was isolated by landslides. Approximately 15,000 people were directly affected by the hurricane. Widespread agricultural losses took place, with hundreds of livestock killed. World Concern director Kelly Miller reported the agricultural effects as \\"staggering\\". The storm wrecked 929 homes and damaged 3,058 others. All told, 56 people were killed, 36 sustained injury, and a further 24 were listed missing; damage across the nation reached $50 million. Aftermath With flash floods ensuing across much of southern Haiti on July 7, the Civil Protection Department released 2 million gourdes (US$48,800) in emergency funds. This was later increased in 5 million gourdes (US$120,500). M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res, the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, the World Food Programme, and other international agencies mobilized for relief efforts on this day. The IFRC provided immediate funds of 250,000 Swiss francs (US$192,000). By July 15, the nation's government requested international assistance to handle the aftermath of Hurricane Dennis. Japan was the first nation to comply, providing emergency supplies‚Äîsuch as blankets, generators, and radios‚Äîworth ¬•11 million (US$97,900). This coincided with a disaster declaration by U.S. charg√© d'affaires Douglas Griffiths, which also prompted release of US$50,000 in funds from the United States Agency for International Development. World Concern provided aid to 18,000 people, distributing emergency kits with food and basic supplies. On July 15, the Inter-American Development Bank announced a US$5 million program to establish an early- warning system for floods across Haiti. In conjunction with funds to alleviate strain from a drought preceding Dennis, the European Commission provided Haiti with ‚Ç¨400,000 (US$477,000). Hurricane Emily brought further death and damage to the nation on July 17, though the effects were limited in comparison to Dennis. The IFRC's relief operation began on August 5, with a focus on distribution of hygiene and sanitation items. Approximately 4,000 people affected by Dennis and a further 1,000 by Emily were targeted in their program. Inclusive of funds allocated for Jamaica, the operation cost 758,000 Swiss francs (US$587,505).

History Speedway racing had taken place at the Granville Showgrounds during the 1930s with races using the existing ¬Ω-mile harness racing track. However, with speedway already established at the Sydney Showground Speedway and Sydney Sports Ground, as well as racing at the nearby Cumberland Oval, racing at Granville was short-lived. The new clay surfaced oval was the brainchild of former Sydney driver Sid Hopping, who wanted to give Sydney a track purpose-built for the new, faster breed of American-style sprintcars. Sydney's two other tracks at the time, the Showground and the Liverpool Speedway, did run sprintcars, though the Showground was deemed too narrow while Liverpool had changed from dirt to bitumen in 1974, which suited the sedans, but not so much the Super Modifieds (later to become sprintcars) and Speedcars. The clay track at the Granville Showgrounds was laid out and first practices took place in January 1977 to test out the track. Hopping and his partner Bert Wilder ran meetings on Friday nights so as not to compete with the Showground or Liverpool, which raced on Saturday nights. From its opening, the new speedway became known as the premier sprintcar track in Australia, a title it still enjoys . With its wide open spaces (the track itself has no actual safety fence, with the old trotting track forming a barrier between the track and the outside safety fence) and short straights, Parramatta City Raceway was home to some of the country's best drivers, including multiple Australian Champions Garry Rush, George and Brooke Tatnell, Bob Tunks, and Skip Jackson, as well as other top drivers including Bob \\"The Streak\\" Blacklaw, former motocross star Stephen Gall. and John Walsh. Since its opening, the speedway has hosted the Australian Sprintcar Championship on six occasions (1978, 1992, 1997, 2002, 2008, 2017), as well as the Australian Speedcar Championship (1988, 1994, 2006) and the Australian Super Sedan Championship (2003). It also hosted rounds of David Tapp's Australian Speedway Masters Series for Solos (in a rare visit to the track) and in 2004 became the first speedway outside of North or Central America to host the famed World of Outlaws sprintcar series, which featured some of America's best taking on the locals. The winner of the event was Outlaws 'King' and regular visitor to both Australia and Parramatta, Steve Kinser. The event eventually forced local sprintcar authorities to consider switching from a 372 ci engine formula to the more familiar 410ci formula used by sprintcars elsewhere. Valvoline Raceway has also been the venue for the Australian Sprintcar Grand Prix since its inception in 1979 as well as hosting the Australian Speedcar Grand Prix in 1997, 1998, 2001 and 2011. In 2015, the track hosted the Speed Energy Formula Off-Road truck racing series, popularly known as the Stadium Super Trucks, as a support event for the Ultimate Sprintcar Championship; Sheldon Creed went on to win the first (and only) Formula Off-Road race held at Valvoline Raceway. Wayne Fisher set the very first one-lap record on 9 December 1977 with a time of 16.70 seconds.

Facts DocMorris was a pharmacy in the Netherlands, and offered medicine for sale on its website. German legislation prohibited the sale of medicinal products outside of pharmacies. The German Pharmacy Association brought an actions against DocMorris in order to prevent it from selling medicinal products to customers based in Germany. During the action, a preliminary reference was made to the Court of Justice. DocMorris argued that the German legislation breached what is now TFEU Article 34. Judgment The Court of Justice held that the measure was within art 34, it could not be justified for non- prescription medicine, but could be justified for prescription medicine. 72\\\\. By contrast, the Court has accepted the relevance of the argument that a prohibition on television advertising deprived a trader of the only effective form of promotion which would have enabled it to penetrate a national market (see De Agostini and TV-Shop, paragraph 43). Furthermore, the Court has found that in the case of products such as alcoholic beverages, the consumption of which is linked to traditional social practices and to local habits and customs, prohibiting all advertising directed at consumers in the form of advertisements in the press, on the radio and on television, the direct mailing of unsolicited material or the placing of posters on the public highway is liable to impede access to the market for products from other Member States more than it impedes access for domestic products, with which consumers are instantly more familiar (see Case C-405/98 Gourmet International Products [2001] ECR I-1795, paragraphs 21 and 24). 73\\\\. As regards a prohibition such as that laid down in Paragraph 43(1) of the AMG, it is not disputed that the provision contains both a requirement that certain medicines be sold only in pharmacies and a prohibition on mail-order sales of medicines. It is true that such a prohibition on mail-order sales may be regarded as merely the consequence of the requirement for sales to be made exclusively in pharmacies. However, the emergence of the internet as a method of cross-border sales means that the scope and, by the same token, the effect of the prohibition must be looked at on a broader scale than that suggested by the Apothekerverband, by the German, French and Austrian Governments and by the Commission (see paragraphs 56 to 59 of this judgment). 74\\\\. A prohibition such as that at issue in the main proceedings is more of an obstacle to pharmacies outside Germany than to those within it. Although there is little doubt that as a result of the prohibition, pharmacies in Germany cannot use the extra or alternative method of gaining access to the German market consisting of end consumers of medicinal products, they are still able to sell the products in their dispensaries. However, for pharmacies not established in Germany, the internet provides a more significant way to gain direct access to the German market. A prohibition which has a greater impact on pharmacies established outside German territory could impede access to the market for products from other Member States more than it impedes access for domestic products. 75\\\\. Accordingly, the prohibition does not affect the sale of domestic medicines in the same way as it affects the sale of those coming from other Member States. 76\\\\. The answer to Question 1(a) is therefore that a national prohibition on the sale by mail order of medicinal products the sale of which is restricted to pharmacies in the Member State concerned, such as the prohibition laid down in Paragraph 43(1) of the AMG, is a measure having an effect equivalent to a quantitative restriction for the purposes of Article 28 EC. Whether there is any justification for the prohibition on mail-order sales (Question 1(b)).} See also *European Union law Notes References * External links * European Union goods case law ","title":"Deutscher Apothekerverband v 0800 DocMorris NV"},{"id":"48615983","text":"Stanis≈Çaw Blok DFC was a Polish fighter ace of the Polish Air Force in World War II with 5 confirmed kills.

Built in 1988 in the north-west corner of Victoria Square after much public protest, as it cut off the first part of Victoria Street, its construction happened at the same time and enabled the substantial redesign of Victoria Square. The building had New Zealand's largest atrium, and was one of the city's largest hotels. The building suffered significant damage in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake and was demolished in April 2012. The Crowne Plaza group has secured a lease in the Forsyth Barr Building at the opposite end of Victoria Square. History British town planner Gordon Stephenson was commissioned to find an appropriate location for major civic assets in the Christchurch Central City; the city had never had a municipally-owned town hall, and it was in need of new civic offices, with the Civic running out of room. His 1962 report recommended the northern part of Victoria Square for the Christchurch Town Hall, and the north-western corner for the new civic offices. This required the closure of the south-eastern section of Victoria Street that ran through Victoria Square, something that was confirmed in Christchurch City Council's 1965 planning document Traffic in a New Zealand City from 1965. The Town Hall opened in 1972. Under the mayor Ron Guthrey's leadership, Christchurch's elected members had signed off on the new civic offices in March 1970, and Christchurch architecture firm Warren and Mahoney was undertaking the design. The Christchurch City (Reserves) Empowering Act 1971 was passed by Parliament, and that provided an important legal basis for the closure of Victoria Street. Another step, taken much later in 1985, was the process of removing the underlying legal road status from that part of Victoria Street located between the river and Kilmore Street; the remainder had never been designated legal road, but had always been a reserve. Guthrey's mayoralty came to an end in 1972 over the proposed new road through Hagley Park in accordance with the 1965 traffic report, and his successor, Neville Pickering, cancelled the civic offices project and had bought Miller's Department Store building in Tuam Street purchased instead for new offices. Christchurch Town Hall, with the pedestrian bridge connecting it to the adjacent hotel visible on the right Map showing the previous Crowne Plaza location (red) and the future location (yellow) Christchurch City Council convened a working party in 1983 and that group recommended for Victoria Street to be removed, and a tourist hotel be built in the north-west corner of Victoria Square. Whilst there was extensive public consultation on the proposed changes to the layout of Victoria Square, the public was not consulted about the hotel proposal. The city's architect suggested that an L-shaped building be appropriate for the corner site. An architectural competition was called for that received much attention from domestic and overseas firms. Five proposals were short-listed and more detailed plans invited. Those plans were provided by Air New Zealand, DFC New Zealand Limited, Sheraton Hotels, developers Paynter & Hamilton (brothers-in- law Albert Paynter and Hugh Hamilton), and Southern Pacific Hotels Corporation (SPHC). The latter, the Australian-based parent company of Travelodge, had engaged Warren and Mahoney as their architect, and their proposal was chosen in September 1984. Part of the proposal was to use the hotel as a convention centre in conjunction with the adjacent town hall, and to connect the two buildings via a pedestrian bridge at first floor level. While the Parkroyal was under construction, the changes to Victoria Square were constructed, based on the 1983 concept plan that was adhered to in all its main features. The landscape architects had chosen a plan with contoured earth mounds, and a meandering path towards the Avon River bridge; an earlier idea was to keep the symmetry of Victoria Square with a future pathway, in place of the road, going straight to the civic offices.

The primary focus of her writing and teaching was on Germany's eighteenth and nineteenth century classical literature. Life Ursula Wertheim was born in Nowawes, a township a short distance to the east of Potsdam in central Germany. Her student studies took her to Berlin's Humboldt University between 1948 and 1953 where her subjects were German studies, History and Art History. The eastern part of Berlin had ended the war in the Soviet occupation zone, and she was a member of the first generation of scholars in what later became East Germany to undertake her studies through the Marxist prism, which accompany her through her academic career. By 1951 she had transferred to Jena where her teachers included Gerhard Scholz. Between 1951 and 1953 she combined her studies with work as an assistant at the \\"Goethe and Schiller Archive\\" and at the \\"Goethe Era Museum\\" (\\"Goethezeit-Museum\\"), both in Weimar, roughly half an hour to the west of Jena. She received her doctorate in 1957 for work on Friedrich Schiller, focusing on his plays \\"Die Verschw√∂rung des Fiesco zu Genua\\" and \\"Don Karlos, Infant von Spanien\\". The theme identified in the title of her dissertation was that of \\"Problems with the historical material in the drama of the young Schiller\\", which hints at an increasing overlap between Sociology and more traditionally academic fields of study such as History and Literature: this was a general trend in officially approved academic scholarship in East Germany during the 1950s and 60s. Further academic advancement came with her habilitation in 1963. This time her subject was the West‚Äì√∂stlicher Divan (lyrical poetry collection) by Goethe and its interpretational relationship with translations of the work of Hafez from which Goethe had appropriated themes. In 1963/64 she set on course and briefly headed up the Theatre History department at Jena. She continued to promote study of theatre history at the university, conducting pertinent seminars on it. In 1965 she was appointed university professor for the history of modern and contemporary literature. The focus of her work continued to concern traditionally Marxist oriented study of classical German literature. By the time she retired in 1979, her approach to the literary classics through a single rather rigid Socio-political prism was seen by some to have been superseded by newer methodologies.

Goodrich is a professor in the Department of Neurobiology at the Harvard Medical School.  Biography  Lisa Vaughn Goodrich was born on March 15, 1969 in Washington, DC, daughter of Robert Lindner Goodrich and Nancy Nicholes Goodrich. When she was three years old, her family moved to Carlisle, Massachusetts, and in 1978 moved to Concord, Massachusetts. She graduated in 1987 from Concord Carlisle High School. She then attended Harvard University, where she graduated summa cum laude in 1991. After spending a year at University College Dublin, she completed her Ph.D program in Neuroscience at Stanford University in 1998. She then did a postdoctoral fellowship under Marc Tessier-Lavigne at the University of California San Francisco. There, she cultivated a particular interest in the auditory system and utilized her familiarity with molecular genetics and cell behavior, and applied it to the sensory system. Goodrich currently resides in Newton, Massachusetts. She is married to Eamon O'Neill and has two children. She enjoys reading and cooking.  Research  In her laboratory, her group studies the cellular and molecular mechanisms that impact the development of neural circuits. The stages of development being studied are determination, differentiation, how axonal connections are formed, and generation of behavior. Her research program focuses on detecting genes necessary for hearing and balance. Her research hopes to connect molecular pathways that are essential in cochlea development, and to influence these pathways to repair the cochlea after suffering damage. It focuses on how the steps of circuit assembly coincide to construct neural networks that are committed to particular functions. In order to do so, research from mouse molecular genetics and genomics is studied to discover how circuit assembly is regulated. The two main assemblies she studies are the auditory circuit assembly and the rental circuit assembly. Goodrich's lab utilizes various genetic techniques in mice and biochemical assays and embryological studies in chicks. She also uses forward and reverse genetic approaches in mice to gain an understanding of how genetic mutations can lead to fluctuations in hearing and balance. She also studies morphogenesis, and how this developmental event is essential in how the nervous system functions.  Publications  Goodrich currently has 42 publications on research relative to the sensory system and neurobiology. Among them are her articles on \\"Morphological and physiological development of auditory synapses,\\" \\"Gata3 is a critical regulator of cochlear wiring,\\" and \\"Deaf and dizzy mice: A genetic dissection of inner ear development.\\" Her laboratory has also created a number of resources that are made available to other researchers who have an interest in the inner ear and its development.

In 1802 he built a two-story log cabin for himself in downtown Franklin. Later that year he was appointed by President Thomas Jefferson as one of the first postmasters of Great Miami River valley. His home was soon converted into a post office. That post office, the Franklin Post Office, still stands today in a different location and is the oldest post office in Ohio. He continued to prosper in trade in Akron, Ohio and Cleveland and he was a key figure in the founding of Dayton, Ohio. He also became a prominent citizen in Franklin, becoming an elector, and plotting out many neighborhoods.  Personal life  John was married twice. His married his first wife, Sarah Tapscott, on September 2, 1802; they had twelve children. His second wife was Phebe W. Reeder, widow of his cousin William R. Schenck, and they married on October 8, 1843. He was a very successful merchant and was able to retire at an early age in 1847. He died on October 26, 1867 and was buried at Woodhill Cemetery in Franklin.  References  American postmasters 1778 births 1867 deaths burials in Ohio ","title":"John N. C.

Fleming (May 27, 1884 ‚Äì May 15, 1960) was an American naturalist whose conservation work led to the founding of Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve, now a 2000-acre protected coastal area of La Jolla, San Diego. The Torrey pine, Pinus torreyana, is the rarest pine species in the United States.The Torrey pine is an endangered species that grows only in two places, the La Jolla coastal bluff that Fleming worked to protect, and on Santa Rosa Island of the Channel Islands. As district superintendent of state parks for southern California, Fleming also worked to protect major nature preserves that extend from the U.S. border with Mexico to northern San Diego county; these include the natural areas that became Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, Cuyamaca Rancho State Park and Palomar Mountain State Park. As a fellow of the San Diego Society of Natural History, he worked closely with scientists and staff of the San Diego Natural History Museum, leading public nature walks for the museum and lecturing on environmental issues.  Biography  Pinus torreyana at State Reserve (photo: Richard O. Barry) Guy and Margaret Fleming House, built in 1927. Torrey Pines State Reserve, San Diego, CA Born in Nebraska on May 27, 1884, to Georgia Lowd and James Fleming (a carpenter), Guy L. Fleming was twelve when his family moved to Corvallis, Oregon. In 1909, he moved to San Diego and found work as a gardener for the Little Lander Colony of San Ysidro, laying out and planting the village park. His work caught the attention of former San Diego County Horticultural Commissioner and chairman of the advisory board for the Little Landers, George P. Hall, who encouraged Fleming to study botany. In 1911 he worked in the nursery preparing for the 1915 Panama-California Exposition; during the fair, he became a guide, giving talks on plants and landscaping. In 1921, Fleming was hired by Ellen Browning Scripps as the custodian and naturalist of her property of Torrey Pines; in that year, the city of San Diego also hired him to be caretaker of the city- owned portion of Torrey Pines property adjacent to the Scripps land. Working with landscape architect Ralph D. Cornell, Fleming developed plans to preserve the Torrey pines on both the city and Scripps properties, proposing a nature park for the area. In 1922, they studied the only other stand of Torrey pines on Santa Rosa Island. In 1923, Fleming became a fellow of the San Diego Society of Natural History, working throughout the 1920s to educate the public on conservation issues, leading nature walks and lecturing on the region's botanical diversity. He participated in study of pines in Baja California and of the proposed Kings Canyon National Park region and conducted a timber survey of Cuyamaca. In 1927, Fleming married artist Margaret Doubleday Eddy; Margaret Fleming's father William Abner Eddy invented the Eddy kite. together they built a small home on the Scripps property at Torrey Pines. Their home, the Guy and Margaret Fleming House, also known as Torrey Pines Reserve Ranger Residence, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in June 1998. In 1932, Fleming was appointed District Superintendent for all southern California state parks (then 20 parks); during the Depression, he had responsibility for the administration of six CCC camps. Fleming retired from the California State Parks System in 1948, but continued to be active in conservation efforts. In 1950, he was a founding member of the Torrey Pines Association, working to integrate the Torrey Pines City Park into the California State Park System. Fleming died on 15 May 1960.

Life Janura was born on 25 March 1911 in Fier, then still part of the Ottoman Empire. He emigrated to Romania at an early age and finished high school there. Janura studied law in Italy and graduated in jurisprudence from the University of Pisa. In 1941 he returned to Albania (at that time the Albanian Kingdom under Italy) where he started working as a judge in Gostivar, which had been recently incorporated in the Albanian state. Janura remained in Yugoslavia after World War II. From that moment he was engaged in the development of the Albanian literature and language, literary criticism, and the overall status of the Albanian language within Yugoslavia, and specifically the Republic of Macedonia. He was also a folklorist, having collected and published rare Albanian folklore. As the head of the Albanian Catedra of the University of Skopje, he participated in the Orthography Congress of 1972 and was one of the signatories of the newly established orthographic rules.

He and his brother Ahmad took the reins of power from their ailing brother Mulhim Shihab and ruled jointly until Mansur became the sole emir after winning a power struggle with Ahmad in 1763. Mansur aligned himself with Zahir al-Umar and Ali Bey, the autonomous rulers of Galilee and Egypt, respectively, in their rebellion against the Ottomans. Mansur was subsequently forced by the Druze sheikhs of Mount Lebanon to step down in favor his nephew Yusuf Shihab after Zahir and Ali Bey were defeated in 1770. Family Mansur was born in 1714.Farah 2000, p. 766. His father was Haydar Shihab, the Emir of Mount Lebanon, a semi-autonomous region in the Ottoman province of Sidon. They belonged to the Shihab dynasty which succeeded the Ma'an dynasty as the rulers of Mount Lebanon.Harris, pp. 119-120. Emir of Mount Lebanon After Haydar died in 1732, his son and Mansur's brother, Mulhim, succeeded him. A power struggle later ensued between Mulhim and Mansur in 1753 and when the former became sick, Mansur and his other brother Ahmad and the powerful Druze clans successfully pressured him to relinquish his authority to Mansur and Ahmad, who were to rule jointly, in 1754. Afterward, Mulhim and his nephew Qasim Shihab tried to oust Mansur and Ahmad, but were unsuccessful. In 1760, a year after Mulhim died, the governor of Sidon, an ally of Qasim, forced Mansur to hand over control of the Shuf region, but Mansur and Ahmad raised 50,000 qirsh (modern equivalent of $600,000) to restore their control. Mansur and Ahmad turned against each other in a power struggle in 1763, with the latter mobilizing the Yazbaki faction‚Äîan alliance of the Druze clans of Imad, Talhuq and Abd al-Malik‚Äîagainst Mansur, who was backed by the Druze Jumblatt clan and the governor of Sidon. Ahmad acquiesced to Mansur's authority after realizing his brother had the stronger position. Abd al-Salam Imad of the Yazbaki faction and Ali Jumblatt mediated between Mansur and Ahmad and came to an agreement where Mansur would rule alone, while Ahmad could live in peace at Deir al-Qamar.Abu Izzedin, p. 203. Although Mansur and Ahmad had ended their dispute, Mulhim's son Yusuf Shihab, had declared his support for Ahmad and sought shelter with Mansur's ally, Sheikh Ali Jumblatt. Jumblatt attempted to mediate the dispute between the uncle and nephew, but Mansur dismissed the gesture and seized Yusuf's properties. Jumblatt subsequently defected from Mansur's camp and gave his backing to Yusuf, who also approached Uthman Pasha al-Kurji, the governor of Damascus for support. Uthman Pasha instructed his son, the governor of Tripoli to assign Yusuf authority over the fiefs of Byblos and Batroun, which became Yusuf's base of operations against Mansur, who was based further south in the Shuf. In 1768, an alliance was formed between Zahir al-Umar, the semi-autonomous Arab sheikh of northern Palestine and Nasif al-Nassar, the preeminent Shia Muslim sheikh of Jabal Amil, the mountainous region between Mount Lebanon and Palestine. Mansur was a close ally of Zahir and supported him and Ali Bey of Egypt in their rebellion against the Ottomans and occupation of Damascus. According to a later Lebanese chronicler, Mansur \\"much loved Zahir al-Umar and rejoiced\\" at his joint invasion of Syria and Palestine with Ali Bey.Harris, p. 302. The defeat of Ali Bey and Zahir prompted the Ottoman authorities to punish Mansur for siding with them. This consequently brought a withdrawal of confidence for Mansur from the Druze clans.Harris, p. 120. He was dismissed and succeeded by Yusuf in 1770. Later life and death Mansur later acted as a mediator between Yusuf and Zahir, who were ostensible enemies, when Yusuf needed Zahir's ally, the Russian Navy, to back him against Jezzar Pasha, the Ottoman general who ousted Yusuf from Beirut.Harris, p. 122.

Picture taken by Alfred & John Bool of the Society for Photographing Relics of Old London. The Oxford Arms in Warwick Lane was one of the last surviving galleried coaching inns in London and stood near St Paul's Cathedral between the 17th and late 19th centuries. It was built in the seventeenth century, before being rebuilt and extended after the Great Fire . The replacement of horse-drawn coaches by the railways inevitably led to its decline, finally being pulled down in 1876 to be replaced by warehouses. Shortly before its demolition in 1869, the ‚ÄòBook of Days‚Äô had an entry for the Oxford Arms. \\"The other galleried inn of Warwick-lane is the Oxford Arms, within a recess on the west side, and nearly adjoining to the residentiary houses of St Paul‚Äôs in Amen-corner. It is one of the best specimens of the old London inns remaining in the metropolis. As you advance you observe a red brick pedimented facade of the time of Charles II, beneath which you enter the inn-yard, which has, on three of its sides, two stories of balustraded wooden galleries, with exterior staircases leading to the chambers on each floor: the fourth side being occupied by stabling, built against part of old London Wall.\\" Final dismantling of the Oxford Arms was not without some controversy, in representing the passing of an era as it did. While the outcry was not enough to save what had become an outmoded institution, much like demolition of the Euston arch some 85 years later, its disappearance resulted in a change of public opinion that led indirectly to the foundation of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings set up in 1877 by William Morris and other enthusiasts.

Her background includes PhD degrees in Operations Research, in Philosophy, and in Art History. She serves as the Head of Management Area in the College of Business. She founded and currently directs the Center for Integration of Business Education & Humanities (CIBEH).CIBEH Center at Stony Brook University Skorin-Kapov received the SUNY Chancellor's Award for Excellence in Scholarship and Creative Activities in 2016. In 2017 Skorin-Kapov received the Ideas Worth Teaching Award from the Aspen Institute business and society program. Biography Jadranka Skorin-Kapov was born in Pula, Croatia in 1955. In 1973 she moved to Zagreb to study mathematics at the University of Zagreb, graduating in 1977. While still an undergraduate student, in 1976 she married her classmate Darko Skorin-Kapov. Their daughters were born in 1979 and 1981. In 1984 the Skorin-Kapov's received doctoral fellowships from the University of British Columbia, the Sauder School of Business, and the family moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Jadranka Skorin-Kapov received her PhD in Operations Research in 1987, and after a year as a Visiting Professor at the University of British Columbia, she accepted a tenure track position at Stony Brook University. At Stony Brook University, Skorin-Kapov got early tenure and promotion to associate professor in 1993, followed by early promotion to professor in 1998. While working as a full-time professor, Skorin-Kapov studied philosophy, receiving her PhD in Philosophy from Stony Brook University in 2007. In 2009 Skorin-Kapov enrolled in the PhD program in Art History and Criticism at Stony Brook University, and in 2014 received her third PhD, this one dealing with Film Studies. Research and publications Skorin-Kapov has about 70 refereed publications in Operations Research, and has received various grants and awards, including five National Science Foundation grants and a Fulbright award. Her scholarship in operations research includes development of algorithms (heuristic search and learning, and polynomial algorithms for special cases) and applications of discrete optimization to location and layout, telecommunications, scheduling, manufacturing design, and network design. Her research in optimization falls into four main clusters: exact solvability of nonlinear integer programs, heuristic solvability of the quadratic assignment problem (QAP), heuristic solvability and sensitivity analysis for the Hub Location Problem (HLP), and optimization in optical networks design. Under her maiden name, in 1995 Skorin-Kapov published a collection of poetry in Chakavian dialect (ƒåakavski) of Croatian language, entitled Vajk z manon.Boljunƒçiƒá, Jadranka (1995) \\"Vajk z manon,\\" The foreword is written by Milan Rakovac.Naƒçinoviƒá, Daniel, \\"Kus mene gre nazad ‚Äì \\"Vajk z manom\\", Glas Istre, July 11, 1995. Skorin-Kapov's work in continental philosophy appeared in The Aesthetics of Desire and Surprise: Phenomenology and Speculation.Skorin-Kapov, Jadranka (2015), \\"The Aesthetics of Desire and Surprise: Phenomenology and Speculation,\\" Lexington Books, This book covers issues central to contemporary continental philosophy: desire, expectations, excess, rupture, transcendence, immanence, and surprise. The proposed term desire||surprise captures the phenomenological- speculative character of the pair not yet and no longer. Skorin-Kapov draws non-obvious parallels between different thinkers, including Levinas, ≈Ωi≈æek, Bataille, Blanchot, Foucault, Ricoeur, Deleuze, Merleau-Ponty, Nancy, Lyotard, and Bachelard. She argues that the works of Hegel, Schelling and Jaspers support the idea that the beginning of aesthetics is where knowledge ends. A review of the book appeared in Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews April 13, 2016.Sj√∂holm, Cecilia (2016), Review of \\"The Aesthetics of Desire and Surprise: Phenomenology and Speculation\\", Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews Skorin- Kapov's subsequent bookThe Intertwining of Aesthetics and Ethics: Exceeding of Expectations, Ecstasy, SublimitySkorin-Kapov, Jadranka (2016), \\"The Intertwining of Aesthetics and Ethics: Exceeding of Expectations, Ecstasy, Sublimity,\\" Lexington Books, analyzes the common experiential ground for both aesthetics and ethics. As for understanding the aesthetic experience as the paradigmatic experience, Skorin-Kapov is informed by Dewey‚Äôs work on art as experience, Gadamer‚Äôs work on experience of art, and Jauss‚Äôs work on the aesthetics of reception and the horizon of expectations. Elements of Kantian morality, Foucault‚Äôs ethics, and Kierkegaard‚Äôs work on interactions between aesthetics and ethics together help to characterize the relation between aesthetics and ethics. Considering surprise due to unexpectedness in comedy, Skorin-Kapov interprets philosophical views on the comedy and laughter (including Aristotle, Kierkegaard, Meredith, and Bergson), using the theatrical work of Dario Fo as an example. A review of the book appeared in The Review of Metaphysics, Vol. LXX, No. 4 (June 2017).Spicher, Michael (2017) Review of Skorin-Kapov, The Intertwining of Aesthetics and Ethics: Exceeding of Expectations, The Review of Metaphysics, Vol. LXX, No. 4, June 2017 Skorin- Kapov's work in film studies includes a book on the oeuvre of the film director, screenwriter, and producer Darren Aronofsky, entitled Darren Aronofsky‚Äôs Films and the Fragility of Hope.Skorin-Kapov, Jadranka (2016), \\"Darren Aronofsky's Films and the Fragility of Hope, \\" Bloomsbury Academic, She deploys her background in philosophy and math to analyze Aronofsky's varied filmography, including œÄ (1998), Requiem for a Dream (2000), The Fountain (2006), The Wrestler (2008), Black Swan (2010), and Noah (2014). Aronofsky is revealed to be a philosopher‚Äôs director, considering the themes of life and death, addiction and obsession, sacrifice, and the fragility of hope. Skorin-Kapov discusses his ability to visually present challenging intersections between not only art and philosophy, but also math, psychology, and art history. The book concludes with a transcript of a conversation between Skorin-Kapov and Aronofsky himself.

Despot Stefan was known to have served Hungarian king Sigismund, and at the same time having an ostensibly friendly relation with the Ottoman prince S√ºleyman √áelebi. This political game was not understood by some of the Serbian nobility, who irreverently attacked the Ottomans; one such case was that of Novak Karaljuk. Karaljuk was mentioned by chronicler Constantine of Kostenets ( 1427‚Äì31) in relation to the war between Stefan and his brother Vuk (d. 1410). He hailed from \\"one of the best families\\", and had even before the division of land between the Lazareviƒá brothers (after the Battle of Kosovo) been appointed to the service of Despot Stefan. He commanded a detachment of the Serbian army in Toplica, and led a guerrilla war against the Ottomans. He made incursions into Ottoman territory, and notably, in 1404, during a passage of the Ottoman army of S√ºleyman through Serbia (via Toplica), he attacked the rear portion of the Ottoman field army from the mountains and captured the whole of the army's treasury, which he took to the Despot in Kru≈°evac. As the passage had been allowed, Stefan himself returned the loot to the Ottomans; when asked to hand over Karaljuk, he told him that this was a man who lived in the forests (like a hajduk), and to whom nothing could be done; the Despot returned the loot, but did not hand over Karaljuk (he did not want to, or perhaps was unable to do so). Revolts against the Ottomans were suppressed, and the brothers' conflict ended with division of the lands. S√ºleyman returned to Anatolia in the summer of 1405. According to Buda Iliƒá's assessment, Karaljuk could not have been a real hajduk (brigand), as he returned the loot to Despot Stefan, nor could he have been a real rebel against the central (Ottoman) government. He was an important nobleman, as he must have had great military strength in order to manage capture the treasury of the Ottoman main army. It seems that he steadily believed in the need and possibility to expel the Ottomans from Serbia, and wanted to show this to Despot Stefan through his efforts. Historian Miodrag Purkoviƒá assumed that Novak Karaljuk was the same as vojvoda Novak who was among the Serbian signatories of the peace treaty with the Republic of Venice in Sveti Srdj on 12 August 1423. Historian Srƒëan Rudiƒá connected him to the \\"Novak Debeljiƒá\\" from epic poetry, and the Debeljiƒá family found in the Illyrian Armorials. The known hajduk character of Stari Novak (\\"Old Novak\\") in Serbian epic poetry is a merger of several individuals in Serbian history, including 14th-century Novak Grebostrek, 15th-century Karaljuk, and 16th-century Starina (Baba) Novak. The novel Vitez Novak Karaljuk (\\"Knight Novak Karaljuk\\") by Slobodan Stojanoviƒá was published in 1949 and re-published in 2013.

She discovered that EphA7 activates the tumor suppressor gene for patients with follicular lymphoma and was awarded the Lorini Foundation Award and Blavatnik Award for Young Scientists for her discovery. Biography Elisa Oricchio was born in 1979 and grew up in Cilento, Italy. She earned a bachelor's degree and went on to attain a master's degree in biology from Sapienza University of Rome. In 2008, she earned her PhD in Medical Microbiology and Immunology from the University of Rome Tor Vergata. Oricchio moved to the United States almost immediately to begin her post-doctorate research at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. In her research, she identified in 2011 that tumor cells treated with pure EphA7, an anti-tumor protein, died, which was a significant discovery in a rarely researched field. Her discovery was awarded with a grant from Sloan Kettering and a Fellowship from the Lymphoma Research Foundation to make further studies of follicular lymphoma. In addition to the research funds, she received the Lorini Foundation Award on 7 May 2012 in Milan, Italy and the Blavatnik Award for Young Scientists in New York City, the same year. In 2012, her research identified that nearly 70% of patients with follicular lymphoma have lost the EphA7 receptor and she was experimenting with methods of reintroducing the protein into the cells. Because there has been no cure success with traditional chemotherapies, Oricchio's work has repeatedly been funded. She was awarded a second Fellowship from the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society and a grant from the US National Institutes of Health. In 2013, she was awarded with a plaque from the town of Vallo della Lucania in her home region of Italy for her research, which was successful in developing a mouse model. In 2014, she was hired by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology as a researcher and to support creation of the new Swiss Cancer Center in Lausanne at the Lausanne University Hospital.

On December 15, 2017, Fowler sued the White Sox and the Illinois state agency that manages their ballpark, Guaranteed Rate Field, for allegedly causing his June 29 injury. His lawsuit, which was filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, according to the Chicago Sun-Times, claimed negligence on the part of the White Sox and the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority in not properly securing the unpadded electrical box he crashed into. In 2018, the defendants tried, and failed, to have the case moved to federal court and dismissed, failing in their claim that Fowler, as an MLB player covered by the league's union contract, could not sue in state court for the injury. As of March 2020, the case was still pending in state court. Fowler began the 2018 season with the Nashville Sounds. The Athletics promoted him to the major leagues on May 9, and he went to bat for the first time in the major leagues that night.

Life As his surname al-katib (\\"the secretary\\") indicates, he was originally a secretary of the Tulunid general Lu'lu', who from Raqqa ruled over northern Syria on behalf of the autonomous emir of Egypt, Ahmad ibn Tulun. When Lu'lu defected to the Abbasid regent al-Muwaffaq in 882, Muhammad followed his master and became a secretary in the central caliphal administration. He is next mentioned by al-Tabari in 891, as secretary to the vizier Abu'l-Saqr Isma'il ibn Bulbul. The latter supported an abortive attempt to depose al-Muwaffaq and restore power to Caliph al-Mu'tamid, but the reaction of the populace of Baghdad and the army thwarted this. In the resulting riots, Muhammad's house was burned down by the mob. Nevertheless, in 896 he was an army commander, and entrusted with enrolling the many officers who had defected from the Tulunids for plotting to kill the new Tulunid emir, Jaysh ibn Khumarawayh. In 903, he was head of the department of the army (diwan al-jaysh) and entrusted with the fight against the Qarmatians. The latter were a radical Isma'ili sect founded in Kufa around 874. Originally a sporadic and minor nuisance in the Sawad, their power grew swiftly to alarming proportions after 897, when they began a series of uprisings against the Abbasids. Under the leadership of Abu Sa'id al-Jannabi, they seized Bahrayn in 899 and in the next year defeated a caliphal army under al-Abbas ibn Amr al- Ghanawi. Another base was established in the area around Palmyra by the missionaries Yahya ibn Zikrawayh, also known by the name Sahib al-Naqa (\\"Master of the She-camel\\") and al-Husayn, probably Yahya's brother, who took the name Sahib al-Shama (\\"Man with the Mole\\"). From their bases in Bahrayn and the Syrian Desert, they struck out against the urban centres of the Abbasid and Tulunid provinces, going as far as to besiege Damascus and ravage the provinces of Syria. The Tulunid army seemed unable to stop them, and the Abbasid government resolved to intervene directly. The campaign was nominally headed by Caliph al-Muktafi in person, but he remained at Raqqa while Muhammad led the army in the field. On 29 November 903, the Abbasid army under Muhammad met the Qarmatians at a location some 24 km from Hamah, and inflicted a crushing defeat upon them. The Qarmatian army scattered and was pursued by the Abbasid troops; the Sahib al-Shama and the other Qarmatian leaders were captured. Al-Muktafi returned to Baghdad, while Muhammad remained at Raqqa to scour the countryside and round up the remaining rebels. He then proceeded to Baghdad, which he entered in triumph on 2 February 904. Eleven days later, he presided over the public execution of the Qarmatian leaders along with the sahib al-shurta of the capital, Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Wathiqi. At a ceremony on 19 May, he was again rewarded by the Caliph with a robe of honour, along with the senior army leaders. Five days after this ceremony, Muhammad again left the capital at the head of an army, numbering 10,000 according to al- Tabari, and tasked with recovering southern Syria and Egypt itself from the Tulunids. His campaign was to be assisted from the sea by a fleet from the frontier districts of Cilicia under Damian of Tarsus. Damian led a fleet up the river Nile, raided its coasts, and prevented supplies for the Tulunid forces from being ferried over it. The Tulunid regime had already been weakened by internal strife and the rivalries of the various ethnic groups in the army, which led to the defection of Badr al-Hammami and other senior officers to the Abbasids; the regime was further weakened by the destructive raids of the Qarmatians and its inability to deal with them. The Abbasid advance was mostly unopposed, and in December, emir Harun ibn Khumarawayh was murdered by his uncles Ali and Shayban. Shayban took over the reins of the state, but the murder caused further defections to the Abbasids, including the governor of Damascus, Tughj ibn Juff. In January, the Abbasid army arrived before Fustat. Shayban abandoned his troops during the night, and the Tulunid capital surrendered. The victorious Abbasids razed the Tulunid-founded capital al-Qata'i to the ground, with the exception of the great Mosque of Ibn Tulun. The members of the Tulunid family and their leading adherents were arrested and deported to Baghdad, while their properties were confiscated. Muhammad left Egypt to the new governor, Isa al-Nushari, and returned to Syria, where he was arrested soon after for embezzling much of the booty from the conquest.

His writings include 28 Smriti digests on Hindu law and a commentary on Dayabhaga.  Life  Raghunandana was born at Nabadwip, to Harihara Bhattacharya. He was a pupil of Srinatha Acharya Chudamani. His writings mention Rayamukuta (1431 CE), and are mentioned by Viramitrodaya of Mitramisra (early 17th century). Thus, it can be inferred that Raghunandana lived around 16th century CE. The various estimates of his lifespan include: * Rajendra Chandra Hazra: 1520-1570 * Monmohan Chakravarti: born 1490 or 1500, literary activity during 1520-1575 * Pandurang Vaman Kane: 1510-1580 Bani Chakravarti wrote a book on him, titled Samaj-samskarak Raghunandan (1964), in Bengali language.  Works  = Astavimsati-tattva = Raghunandana authored 28 Smriti digests on civil law and rituals, collectively known as Astavimsati- tattva. The English scholars compared Raghunandana's digests to the Comyns' Digest, and called him the \\"Comyns of India\\". The titles of these digests end in the word tattva (literally \\"essence\\"). 27 of these works are mentioned at the beginning of Malamasa-tattva. The 28 digests include: Chandoga-vrsotsarga- tattva, Rgvrsotsarga-tattva and Yajur-vrsotsarga-tattva are collectively known as Vrsotsarga-tattva. Deva-pratishtha-tattva and Matha-pratishtha-tattva are collectively known as Pratishtha-tattva. = Commentary on Dayabhaga = Raghunandana's Dayabhaga-tika, also known as Dayabhaga-vyakhya[na], is a commentary on Jimutavahana's Hindu law treatise Dayabhaga. During the British Raj, when Hindu law was used in the courts, the Calcutta High Court termed Raghunandana's Dayabhaga-tika as the best commentary on Dayabhaga. William Jones, a puisne judge at the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William, mentioned that the local Hindu scholars often referred to Jimutavahana's treatise, but it was Raghunandana's work that was \\"more generally approved\\" in Bengal. The commentary quotes several other scholars and writings, including Medhatithi, Kulluka Bhatta, Mitakshara, Vivada-Ratnakara of Chandeshvara Thakura, Shulapani and Vivada-Chintamani of Vachaspati Mishra (often critically). There have been some doubts about the authorship of this commentary. Both Henry Thomas Colebrooke (1810) and Julius Eggeling (1891) suspected that it was not authored by the writer of Divya-tattva (that is, Raghunandana). However, Monmohan Chakravarti (1915) and Rajendra Chandra Hazra (1950) both attribute the work to Raghunandana. Pandurang Vaman Kane also ascribes the commentary to him, but not without hesitation. = Other works = His other works include: * Gaya-shraddha paddhati * Graha-yaga-tattva (or Graha-pramana-tattva) * Tirtha-yatra-tattva (or Tirtha-tattva) * Tripuskara- santi-tattva * Dvadasa-yatra-tattva (or Yatra-tattva) * Rasa-yatra tattva (or Rasa-yatra paddhati)  References  Sanskrit scholars from Bengal 16th-century Indian writers ","title":"Raghunandana"},{"id":"48617161","text":"The Beaver Coat () is a 1937 German comedy film directed by J√ºrgen von Alten and starring Heinrich George, Ida W√ºst, and Rotraut Richter.Bock & Bergfelder p. 154 It is an adaptation of Gerhart Hauptmann's play The Beaver Coat.

Youth includes individuals between the ages of 15 and 24 Over half of the population is under 19 years old in 2011, the highest proportion of young people of any country in Latin America. The health, education, and work opportunities for young people differ by ethnicity (ladino or indigenous) and social class. Male literacy rate is 89.3% and the female literacy rate is 85.6%. Secondary education participation is around 17%. 30.3% of youth are married by the age of 18. Poverty and inequality affect a youth's access to healthcare. Females experience less access to health care and education than males. The lack of adequate nutrition and health care in Guatemala has adverse effects on a youth's overall health. One example being stunted growth of half of the Guatemalan youth. The Millennium Development Goals works to these inequalities and barriers. Vulnerable youths who are at-risk for joining a gang are males between the ages of living in marginalized urban areas and have limited access to education. A program called Open Schools combats forces that push youth into dangerous situations and works to overcome barriers that Guatemalan youth face. Community village school  Education  Education in Guatemala has less than full participation. Primary schools do not achieve 100% enrollment and from there, enrollment drops until it reaches about 17% at the high school level. Females are less represented, with 44.3% net enrollment ratio, compared to males at 48%. This contributes to a higher participation in the informal market. Guatemala's public university is USAC, Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala. \\"From every 100 graduate students enrolled in San Carlos of Guatemala University only 13 successfully completed their programs\\". Youth who successfully complete secondary education typically obtain a degree in the social sciences, with 1334 social science master's degrees granted of the 2093 total degrees. The medical field, as well as Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics fields, should be a top priority but are not a focus of higher education. Social connections and ties, as well as nepotism, are viewed as more important than Education. Teachers in Guatemala often encounter youth who were left behind by their parents who migrated elsewhere. They often dissuaded their students from migrating due to loss of human capital experienced during migration. Open Schools, a program launched in 2008, helps prevent violence and protect youth by providing them opportunity to constructively use their free time. Open Schools is not a formal educational environment but it aims to help youth who are disadvantaged through culture, art, sports, and technology. Open Schools program is available to students on the weekends where youth can socialize and participate in constructive activities. Child Aid is another program that helps a youth's educational experience by increasing literacy.  Employment  140,000 Guatemalan youth enter the labor market each year. About 25,000 of those youth gain access to formal employment. Formal employment is often classified as training for the job and social security. It is estimated that jobs in the informal market have reached about 5.1 million. Youth who obtain a degree are not properly utilized in the formal job market, as they are outcompeted by their foreign counterparts. Work after graduation is limited because it is assumed that youth who hold degrees would not be willing to work low paying jobs. Within the public sector, youth are discouraged from participation in the workforce because of poor salaries and disincentives. Youth often enter into the informal job market at a young age, sometimes dropping out of school to support themselves or their families. Informal jobs provide youth with income but are untaxed and unmonitored by the state, examples being farmers or domestic workers. These jobs do not provide youth or other individuals with government protections, like insurance. PILAR, a program which stands for Promoting Informal Labor Rights, works to provide more protection for those in the informal sector. Open Schools provides leadership training and job training to both youth and adults to help ensure steady income and employment. The Millennium Development Goals, or MDG's, targets causes of poverty such as gender inequality, education, and environmental stability. \\"Education and training in business administration and large-scale marketing operations are essential for the youth to join the economic life of the country\\". MDG's purpose is to prevent youth from entering into poverty by providing educational and economic stability.Continuing Promise mission in the Guatemalan community  Health  Emelin, a 13-year-old female, spoke at the United Nations in March 2015 and emphasized the need for health care in her community. A majority of Guatemalans pay for their health costs out-of-pocket, creating unequal access to services. She said, \\"The biggest problems we face as adolescents in my community are early pregnancy, [child]birth, sexual violation and lack of education and health care\\". 20% of female adolescents and 24% of male adolescents have a comprehensive knowledge of HIV. 14.3% of females living in rural areas have a comprehensive knowledge of HIV and 31.5% of females living in urban areas have a comprehensive knowledge of HIV. In Guatemala, there is little contraception awareness and use among Youth. Guatemala has the highest fertility rate in Latin America even with half of its population under the age of 19. A mission called Continuing Promise works to provide health care and community assistance to Latin American youth. Guatemalan youth in rehabilitation program Violence Crime in Guatemala is one issue facing youth. Guatemala has one of the highest homicide rates in the world and lies within one of the most dangerous regions of the hemisphere - Central America. Violence most often emerges in the presence of gangs and drug trafficking, promoting crimes such as theft and kidnapping. \\"Gang youth are widely perceived to be the single most important contributors to violence and insecurity in Central American cities\\". Guatemalan youth struggle with transitions out of a gang to a more stable environment. The Evangelical-Pentecostal religion provides hope to Guatemalan youth, attempting to exit gangs, through conversion. In Guatemala, the Evangelical-Protestant Church receives funding from United States Agency for International Development to help at-risk youth. The funding is used to help correct structural factors that push delinquent youth into gang participation. The ties within the Church provide youth with social capital and connections that may aid in seeking employment. A great risk of death exists for youth attempting to exit Guatemalan gangs. Religious organizations believe that the root causes of gang participation are \\"poverty, weak schools, and unemployment\\". Youth participation in violence has become normalized. While reliable data regarding crime is sparse, there are widespread fears of crime facing Guatemalan youth. \\"Maras [gangs] are generally associated with low- income urban areas, due to high levels of inequality and the lack of social, economic and cultural alternatives available in this context\\", making Guatemala City one of the most dangerous areas in Guatemala. Gangs dominate public space, often limiting areas where others can interact. An estimated 53-330 gangs reside in Guatemala City. Gangs can provide youth with a sense of identity. Youths gain a large amount of social capital in their participation in gangs, making gangs attractive and luring for youth who lack resources. Youth male gang members who are often the perpetrators of violence also fear for their own safety within the gang. Young men in gangs are threatened by members of their affiliated gang and sometimes victims of violence within the gang. Open Schools works to help at risk youth by providing alternatives to participation in gangs. Migration A youth's parents may leave home and migrate to coastal areas or other countries where education and health services are more comprehensive. Parents also migrate to the United States, Mexico, and Canada to support their family and search of economic opportunity. Political corruption and violence are factors that cause a parent to leave their child or children with other caretakers. Youth left behind feel guilt for their parents' sacrifice and often leave school to find work. \\"9% of children living in migrant households receiving remittances dropped out of school\\". Adverse effects on youth of parents migrating include: insecurity, drug use, sexual promiscuity, anxiety, and loneliness. Youth whose parents migrated to the United States often defend them, saying, \\"they are not criminals, because they are going to search for a better life for their family members\\", normalizing their experience. Guatemalan youth see the allure of moving to various other areas as economic incentives but the threats of violence and deportation as well as loss of social capital dissuade many youth from migrating.

In the early 1900s, the Nicholson Water Company had an intake reservoir on the creek. During this time period, the creek was prone to pollution from various causes and typhoid was observed in its watershed. The creek was being used as a water supply as late as the 1950s. In 1959, the state's Water and Power Resources Board gave the Nicholson Borough Authority approval to withdraw up to 225,000 gallons from the creek; previously the limit was 110,000 gallons. A concrete stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying State Route 2096 over Horton Creek was constructed in 1940 in Lathrop Township, Susquehanna County and is long. A concrete tee beam bridge carrying State Route 2002 was constructed over the creek in 1961 in Lathrop Township, Susquehanna County and is long. A prestressed box beam or girders bridge carrying State Route 3023 over the creek was built in 1961 in Lathrop Township, Susquehanna County and is long. A prestressed box beam or girders bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 92 over Horton Creek was built in Nicholson, Wyoming County in 1969 and is long. Horton Creek was described as an \\"excellent\\" site for angling in the Tunkhannock Creek Conservation Plan in 1998. Biology The drainage basin of Horton Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. The creek has been stocked with trout. In 2014, it was stocked with rainbow trout from State Route 3023 downstream to its mouth.

It is part of the second fortified belt of forts of Metz and had its baptism of fire in late 1944, when the Battle of Metz occurred.  Historical context  During the annexation, Metz was a German garrison of between 15,000 and 20,000 men at the beginning of the periodRen√© Bour, Histoire de Metz, 1950, p. 227. and exceeded 25,000 men just before the First World War,Philippe Martin, L'Express, no. 2937, 18‚Äì24 October 2007, Metz en 1900. gradually becoming the first stronghold of the German Reich.Fran√ßois Roth: Metz annex√©e √† l'Empire allemand, in Fran√ßois-Yves Le Moigne, Histoire de Metz, Privat, Toulouse, 1986, p. 350. The ' completed the Second fortified belt of Metz composed of Festen Wagner (1904‚Äì1912), Crown Prince (1899‚Äì1905), Leipzig (1907‚Äì1912), empress (1899‚Äì1905), Lorraine (1899‚Äì1905), Freiherr von der Goltz (1907‚Äì1916), Haeseler (1899‚Äì1905), Prince Regent Luitpold (1907‚Äì1914) and Infantry-Werk Belle-Croix (1908‚Äì1914). Built in the early 20th century, the group fortification became part of a wider program of fortifications called \\"Moselstellung\\", encompassing fortresses scattered between Thionville and Metz in the Moselle valley. The aim of Germany was to protect against a French attack to take back Alsace-Lorraine from the German Empire. The fortification system was designed to accommodate the growing advances in artillery since the end of 19th century. Based on new defensive concepts, such as dispersal and concealment, the fortified group was to be, in case of attack, an impassable barrier for French forces.  Overall design  The scope of protection of the Group Fortification Lorraine was provided by a set of infantry positions, fortified barracks and artillery batteries scattered over a wide area and concealed by the natural topography. From 1899, the Schlieffen plan of the German General Staff designed the fortifications of the Moselstellung, between Metz and Thionville, to function like a lock for blocking any advance of French troops in case of conflict.Donnell Clayton, The German Fortress of Metz: 1870‚Äì1944, Oxford, Osprey, 2008, p. 24. This concept of a fortified line on the Moselle was a significant innovation compared to Syst√®me S√©r√© de Rivi√®res developed by the French. It later inspired the engineers of the Maginot Line.Donnell Clayton, The German Fortress of Metz: 1870‚Äì1944, Oxford, Osprey, 2008, pp. 10‚Äì13.  Construction and facilities  Group Fortification Lorraine was built on the heights of Saulny. It was to strengthen the northwest edge of the first fortified belt. It controlled the railway axis Metz-Verdun, through Amanvillers and the highway Metz-Briey. Covering an area of 385 ha, the Feste Lorraine was built from 1899 to 1903. It consists of a main fortification and two support points north and west. It has 6 howitzers 150 mm wide and six long guns 100 mm wide.Donnell Clayton, The German Fortress of Metz: 1870‚Äì1944, Oxford, Osprey, 2008, p. 24. It had 14 observation domes and 24 lookout posts. It had two concrete barracks, one for 1,000 men, the other for 400 men. It was designed to accommodate four infantry companies, in addition to the gunners. The Feste had a phone line and a power plant with 4 diesel engines of 35 hp. and 600 m of tunnels connecting the different positions.Donnell Clayton, The German Fortress of Metz: 1870‚Äì1944, Oxford, Osprey, 2008, p. 24.  Successive assignments  In 1890 the garrison relief was guaranteed by the fort troops Corps XVI stationed at Metz and Thionville. At the back of the German lines during World War I, the fort did not have the test of fire. In November 1918, the fort was again occupied by the French army. After the departure of French troops in June 1940, the German army reinvested the fort. After the war, the French army resumed the fortified group. The main building was used until 1985 by GRET 806,GRET 806: √©metteurs grande puissance BLI, puis r√©seau RITTER then the 1st Company 43rd signals regiment.The 43rd Signal Regiment was dissolved June 30, 2002. The main building is from the early 2000s decade, used as a support station for electric and two communication antennas of the army. This building is protected by three walls with barbed wire, fence and wrought iron gates. The third stronghold, the most in the center, was recently installed to prohibit access to communications antennas. The building is equipped with an alarm to prevent intrusion. All other blocks are accessible without having to cross the center stronghold.  Second World War  In early September 1944, the Battle of Metz began. The German command integrated the defensive system set up around Metz. On September 2, 1944, Metz was declared, in effect by the Reich, fortress Hitler. The fortress was required to be defended to the last by German troops, whose leaders were all sworn to the F√ºhrer.Ren√© Caboz, La bataille de Metz, √âditions Pierron, Sarreguemines, 1984, p. 132. The next day, September 3, 1944, General Krause, then commander of the fortress of Metz, established his High Command, the main command post in the barracks fort Alvensleben. The same day, the troops of General Krause took position on a line from Pagny-sur-Moselle to Mondelange, passing to the west of Metz by Chambley, Mars-la-Tour, Jarny and Briey. After an initial withdrawal, made on September 6, 1944, on Saint-privat and Amanvillers, the German lines were based firmly on the forts of the sector, particularly in the Group Fortification Lorraine, or Feste Lorraine, and the fortified positions on the sides of Amanvillers: Steinbruch-Stellung, Kellermann, and Wolfsberg-Stellung, Richepance and Batterie Vemont and Canrobert, and Horimont-Steelung. The area of Amanvillers‚ÄìSaint-Privat was bound to the north by 1010th Sicherungs- Regiment of the Colonel Richter of the 462th Infanterie-Division and to the south by the Fahnenjunker of the Fahnenjunkerschule VI des Heeres, \\"Metz\\" under the command of Wehrmacht Colonel Siegroth. The sector fortifications, from Gravelotte to Sem√©court, consisting of a discontinuous concrete wall, three meters high and 10 meters wide, reinforced by four forts, covered on the west by a line of outposts, trenches, barbed wire and machine gun positions, look stunning. On the morning of September 9, 1944, the American artillery rained shells on identified German positions, paving the way for the infantry and the tanks of Task force McConnell. Arriving in the Wood Jaumont US troops' 2nd Infantry regiment were taken under fire by Fort Kellermann. The German batteries eliminated, within moments, seven tanks and two freestanding guns, forcing the column to withdraw precipitately.Hugh M. Cole: The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950, pp. 152‚Äì155. Wanting to bypass the fortifications from the north, the Americans were soon under fire from a German counterattack before being stopped by gunfire from Group Fortification Lorraine. The artillery of the US campaign immediately resumed his attacks on the fortifications of the sector, but without great results considering the terrain and vegetation. The 3rd Battalion of the Task force, in charge of the right flank of the attack, fell on the fortified farmhouse of Moscou,At that same place, the French troops of Napoleon III repelled the assault of three German columns, August 18, 1870, at the Battle of Gravelotte. a veritable redoubt between the German fortifications, before being taken under heavy fire from Gravelotte. The 2nd Battalion Task force, which was heading towards Vern√©ville with relative ease, was finally stopped by gunfire from a sunken road, west of Fort Francis de Guise. The day ended with a failure for Colonel Roffe, who regretted high lossesLosses of 2nd Infantry regiment already amounting to 14 officers and 332 men, including 228 in just the sector of Amanvillers. for \\"twenty odd forts\\". The Colonel of the Roffe 2nd Infantry regiment, whose losses already amounted to 14 officers and 332 men on the morning of September 9, required the air support of General Silvester. On September 10, 1944, three squadrons of fighter-bombers dropped their bombs on the eastern sector of Amanvillers, where the fortifications were grouped. The P-47s reached their targets, but the 500-pound bombs had little effect on the reinforced concrete fortifications. The infantry attack at 6:00 pm met fierce resistance. Despite the support of tanks, it stopped breathless three hours later. Towards Gravelotte, in the Woods G√©nivaux, American troops destroyed the Fahnenjunker of Wehrmacht (army) Colonel Siegroth that dominate the field. On the September 10, 1944, the commander of the 7th Armored Division agreed to take position near Roncourt to support a new attack from the 2nd Infantry regiment. The September 11, 1944, at 6:30 am, the tanks were headed for Pierrevillers, wiping the passage with sporadic gunfire. They finally came across a antitank roadblock, under fire from anti- tank guns camouflaged and difficult to locate. The infantry, however, managed to take a position on the wooded slopes, northwest of the village of Bronvaux, too far, however, to support the 2nd Infantry regiment. Despite several counter attacks by the 462th Infantry Division, American troops arrived to take over the land in the late afternoon, after a rolling artillery barrage targeting fortifications in the sector, and using smoke shells for cover. On September 13, 1944, the US military redeployed its troops on the front line to concentrate its attack on the fortifications. But fatigue and stress disoriented the men of the 2nd Infantry regiment and they were finally relieved of such a Hell hole,\\"Received warning order that we are to be relieved which is good news, this is sure a hell hole\\" (Walking Journal of the 3rd Battalion 2nd Infantry Regimentof September 14, 1944). September 14, 1944. The 1st Battalion Task force, hard hit by the shelling of the 462th Volks- Grenadier-Division and specific small arms fire, had to withdraw with difficulty behind a screen of smoke rockets, more than five hundred meters from Amanvillers. Around 14:00, an air strike on Amanvillers did not allow the infantry to advance, the village being too close to the fortifications of the sector to be taken in full. Two regiments, reinforced by the engineering companies 90th Infantry Division, took over in the area: the 357 Infantry Regiment of Colonel Barth took position along the woods of Jaumont, East of Saint-Privat, while 359 Infantry Regiment of Colonel Bacon took position east of Gravelotte. On September 15, 1944, an attack was planned on the Canrobert sector of buildings and Kellermann sector to the north and Fort Jeanne d'Arc to the south of the sector. The approach was difficult, German soldiers defend inch by inch. American bazookas were not effective on the concrete bunkers, and tanks followed by armed flamethrower sections pouncing on the first German lines, neither reaching them, nor neutralizing them, nor taking them. General McLain sector concluded that a frontal attack would be doomed to failure and ordered his troops to keep the pressure on the outposts 462th Volks-Grenadier- Division without attacking frontally forts Jeanne-d'Arc and Lorraine.Hugh M. Cole: The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950, pp. 176‚Äì183. On September 16, 1944, in thick fog, the attack on Canrobert started at 10:00. It was stopped two hours later by the Fahnenjunker of Colonel Siegroth, who engaged in a man-to-man fight without mercy. The Americans 357th Infantry Regiment withdrew, leaving 72 soldiers in the field. At 5:00 pm, the 1st Battalion of the same regiment was stopped in its tracks by artillery and small arms. In the southern sector, 2 Battalion lost 15 officers and 117 men under heavy fire from mortars and automatic weapons, from the buffer strip. At nightfall, the battalion has advanced only 200 meters. Seeing that the Americans gradually ate away at their lines, the German artillery redoubled its fire, managing to contain the two regiments, and raising fears with General McLain of a new counterattack. Before the pugnacity of the elite troops of the 462th Volks-Grenadier-Division, General McLain, in agreement with the General Walker, decided to suspend the attacks, pending further plans of the General Staff of the 90th Infantry Division. While the troops of the Third US Army sat listening to Marlene Dietrich,Hugh M. Cole: The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950. p. 190. German troops were taking advantage of the lull in fighting to reorganize. Reserve troops of the future 462th Volks-Grenadier-Division reinforced the elite fort troops of Wehrmacht Colonel Siegroth. When hostilities resumed after a rainy month, the soldiers of the 462th Volks-Grenadier-Division still held firmly the forts of Metz, though supplies were more difficult under the artillery and the frequent bombings.Hugh M. Cole: The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950, p. 256. As a prelude to the assault on Metz, November 9, 1944, the Air Force sent no less than 1,299 heavy bombers, B-17s and B-24s, to dump 3,753 tons of bombs, and 1,000 to 2,000 books on fortifications and strategic points in the combat zone of IIIrd army.G√©n√©ral Jean Colin, Contribution √† l'histoire de la lib√©ration de la ville de Metz; Les combats du fort Driant (septembre-d√©cembre 1944), Acad√©mie nationale de Metz, 1963, p. 13. Most bombers, having dropped bombs without visibility at over 20,000 feet, miss their military objectives. In Metz, the 689 loads of bombs dropped over the seven forts of Metz, identified as priority targets, merely caused collateral damage, proving once again the inadequacy of the massive bombing of military targets.Hugh M. Cole: The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950, p. 424. At dawn on November 14, 1944, the 105 mm howitzers from 359th Field Artillery Battalion opened fire on the area located on either side of the Fort Jeanne d'Arc, between the Fort Francis de Guise and the fort Driant to pave the way for 379th Infantry regiment, whose goal was to reach the Moselle. Further north, on November 15, 1944, the works of the Canrobert line in the wood of F√®ves are attacked by the 378th Infantry regiment of colonel Samuel L. Metcalfe. In the morning mist after an artillery preparation, the strong northern Canrobert line was the first to fall, at around 11:00 am, US troops arriving in the wood Woippy. During the afternoon, the men of 1217th Grenadier-Regiment ¬´ Richter ¬ª, consisting of Security Regiment 1010 and those of 1515th Grenadier-Regiment ¬´ St√∂ssel ¬ª of the 462th Volks-Grenadier-Division made several unsuccessful attempts to push the Americans behind the Canrobert line. Under pressure, they ended up dropping out, leaving behind them many casualties.Hugh M. Cole: The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950, p. 435‚Äì436. German grenadiers, who had to withdraw to a line connecting strongpoint Leipzig to the Fort Plappeville, retreated in disorder towards Metz. On November 16, 1944, while the Americans progressed rapidly in Woippy, the Group Fortification Lorraine, considered a strong defensive position behind the Canrobert line, was evacuated without fighting by troops Kittel. The simultaneous attack of 377th and 378th Infantry Regiment had achieved its objectives. Fort Jeanne d'Arc was the last of the forts of Metz to disarm. Determined German resistance, bad weather and floods, inopportunity, and a general tendency to underestimate the firepower of the fortifications of Metz, helped slow the US offensive, giving the opportunity to the German Army withdraw in good order to the Saar.Hugh M. Cole, The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950, p. 448. The objective of the German staff, which was to stall US troops at Metz for the longest possible time before they could reach the front of the Siegfried Line, was largely achieved.

After his return, he remained at the Lyceum until it was closed by the Russian government in 1831. From 1835 to 1841, he operated a private art school from his home and, from 1838 to 1840, was a lecturer at the \\"Alexandria Institute for Young Ladies\\". Then, from 1841 to 1844, he was a teacher at the newly-established Royal Gymnasium. In 1844, he joined with Jan Feliks Piwarski to establish the \\"School of Fine Arts\\" and taught there until his death, two years later. Cyprian Kamil Norwid was his best-known pupil. The school was closed in 1864, because its students had participated in the January Uprising. It was reopened in 1904 and, since 1932, has been known as the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw.

In these developing countries, it helps add micronutrients (such as folic acid, iodine, and iron) to fortify foods such as flour, sugar, rice, and oil in order to tackle micronutrient deficiency in developing countries. It was started by David M. Dodson and Stephanie Dodson Cornell and initially targeted to help fortify food with folic acid to benefit Honduran children, after a trip to Honduras in 2000 where they became aware of the malnutrition problem in Honduras and of the cost-effectiveness of food fortification. In 2008, Project Healthy Children went into Rwanda in order to deal with anemia and goiter. In 2010 PHC helped set up a National Fortification Alliance. It is listed as a top charity by Giving What We Can. Reviews =Giving What We Can review= Giving What We Can (GWWC) published a detailed review of PHC, along with a case study of its food fortification efforts in Rwanda.

PHC was first added to GWWC's list of top charities on May 16, 2013. Explaining the decision to add them, GWWC's Robert Wiblin wrote that PHC was pursuing a promising, low-cost, high-upside approach and seemed to have strong overall competency at executing it.

Experimenting with inventive vocal arrangements and fuzz- toned guitar melodies, the group was a forerunner in the musical genre of psychedelic rock. The band released what is commonly agreed by music historians as the first psychedelic single by a native New Mexican group, with their debut \\"I Wanna Come Back (From the World of LSD)\\". History Formed in 1966, the band was originally known as the Playmates, and included members Victor Roybal (organ), Eddie Roybal (drums), Mike Layden (lead guitar), Joe Abeyta (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), and Ernie Gonze (bass guitar). The group soon recruited Danny Houlihan (lead vocals), and replaced Abeyta with Eddie James, who already had prior experience performing with the Champs. With the addition of two members, the Playmates decided a name change was in order. It was initially suggested by Houlihan to rechristen the group the Fe-Fi-Fo- Fum, as a reference to the phrase said by the giant in the fairy tale \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\"; however, feelings toward the proposal were split and, as a compromise, they agreed on the Fe-Fi-Four Plus 2 (equating to the total number of band members). The band performed around New Mexico, developing a sizable following and hiring Tommy Bee as their manager in the process. Bee arranged a recording contract with Lance Records, resulting in the Fe-Fi-Four Plus 2 being guided through the recording process with record producer Norman Petty, who had past successes with Buddy Holly and the Fireballs. The group entered Norman Petty Studios in late 1966 to record Houlihan's \\"I Wanna Come Back (From the World of LSD)\\", a song about an individual struggling to escape the horrors of a bad LSD trip. With bone-chilling wails and distorted guitar melodies, \\"I Wanna Come Back\\" has all the elements of early psychedelic rock. Speaking about the band's hallucinatory sound, keyboardist Victor Roybal explained why the group was eager to branch out from usual pop music: \\"We were looking for a new and original sound. Much of what we had been doing [was] performing top 40 sounds which people requested to hear\\". In 1967, Lance Records released \\"I Wanna Come Back\\" with \\"Double-Crossin' Girl\\" on the Fe-Fi- Four Plus 2's debut single. It is generally agreed upon by music historians that \\"I Wanna Come Back\\" was the first psychedelic song released by a New Mexican band. Original pressings of the record printed the tag line \\"(From the World of LSD)\\", until requests by distributors resulted in its removal. This slight alteration did not affect the single's sales, as the release's regional success prompted Polydor Records to issue \\"I Wanna Come Back\\" in Europe. In mid-1967, the Fe-Fi-Four Plus 2 recorded their follow-up single \\"Mr. Sweet Stuff\\", not for Lance Records, but rather the small Odex label after Bee had a falling out with supervisors. The Fe-Fi-Four Plus 2 did not receive much advertisement support from Odex, and, as a consequence of the draft decimating the lineup, the group disbanded in 1968. Since its initial distribution, \\"I Wanna Come Back\\" has appeared on numerous compilation albums, such as Pebbles, Volume 5, New Mexico Punk Groups from the Sixties, Pebbles Box, Sixties Archives, Volume 4, and Garage Beat '66 Volume 1: Like What, Me Worry?!.

United States Butter sold in the United States is assigned one of three letter grades; AA, A, and B. By a 1923 act of Congress, all butter sold in the United States must be composed of at least 80% milkfat. Butter is graded based on the sweetness of its flavor, the quality of cream the butter was made from, the smoothness of its texture, and the degree of flavor impurities such as acidity, bitterness, feed, malty, musty, weed, and whey. The grade indication of the butter is usually displayed in the most prominent area of the packaging, although it may also be displayed on the side or elsewhere. When grading butter, the inspector begins with a score of 100. Each defect in flavor, texture, color, or saltiness results in a subtraction of one-half, one, or one and one-half points, depending on the characteristic and the degree of the defect, whether it is slight, definite, or pronounced. Butter that exceeds certain workmanship dis-ratings is rated on flavor only, and can not attain the highest grades. Grade AA butter, made from sweet cream, is the highest grade of butter, has a sweet flavor, and is readily spreadable. If the butter is salted, the salt must be evenly distributed and not interfere with the smooth texture of the butter. To get this grade, the butter must achieve a score of at least 93 out of a possible 100. It is widely available at most places food products are sold. Butter graded as \\"AA\\" does not necessarily indicate the butter may meet the expectations of gourmands. Grade A, made from fresh cream, has a stronger flavor than grade AA butter. Butter of this grade must score 92 points. It is likely to be of a coarser texture than grade AA. Like grade AA, it is widely available at food markets across the country. Grade B butter is the lowest grade of butter available for consumer use. It is often made from sour cream. Grade B butter must score at least 90 points, anything less can not be made available to United States consumers. The texture of this grade may be crumbly, sticky, or watery. This grade of butter is usually only used in cooking, or some manufacturing processes, although many consumers will find it perfectly palatable. In addition, all U.S. butters must pass microbiological standards. Canada Butter, along with other dairy products, is given a grade of Canada 1, Canada 2, or Canada 3. Butter of the first grade cannot be made from cream given the second grade. Grade 3 butter is a processing grade used for product packaged and sold in bulk.

It creates reports through The Humane League Labs, which evaluates advocacy presentation and methods and publishes them as reports. One of these reports includes a study showing how distributing leaflets at colleges affects diet change. It was founded in 2005 in Philadelphia by Nick Cooney. In February 2016, THL was awarded a $1 million grant from the Open Philanthropy Project (a spinoff of GiveWell working in collaboration with Good Ventures) for its corporate cage-free campaign. This was followed by an additional grant of $1 million in July 2016 for international expansion of cage-free advocacy, and a $1 million grant in November 2016 for general support.  Activism  = Corporate outreach = As of February 2015, THL had been involved in at least 67 successful campaigns to convince corporations to use only non-battery cage eggs. These victories include major corporations Costco, Grupo Bimbo, Starbucks, Compass Group, and Dunkin' Donuts. According to the Open Philanthropy Project, \\"Other leading organizations in corporate campaigns have consistently reported to us that THL plays a key role in these campaigns.\\" In March 2015 THL won a major victory with a cage-free pledge by Sodexo. In 2016 THL continued to secure cage-free commitments from major corporations, including Kroger, Denny's, and Restaurant Brands International (parent company of Burger King). According to THL, cage- free commitments secured in the first quarter of 2016 will affect tens of millions of hens. Following negotiations with THL, United Egg Producers‚Äîwhich represents companies that produce 95% of all eggs produced in the United States‚Äîannounced it will eliminate the culling of male chicks by 2020. Chick culling refers to the routine killing of male chicks (which are useless for meat or egg-laying), usually by gassing or grinding them alive. Under this policy, millions fewer chicks will be killed each year. In December 2018, THL, along with 59 other major animal welfare organizations, secured a cage-free commitment with Marriott International by 2025. = Grassroots outreach = Grassroots outreach is a major focus of THL. According to ACE, THL distributed 841,778 leaflets and reached 4,358 students through humane education in the first three quarters of 2015. THL has a Campus Organizer program in which college students are paid a stipend to lead animal activist efforts on their college campus. = Online ads = Outreach via online ads is another of THL's main activities. The organization reported 1,942,924 clicks on their ads in the first three quarters of 2015.  Humane League Labs  Humane League Labs is a unit of THL founded in 2013 to conduct research on the effectiveness of different animal advocacy tactics. As of June 2016, Humane League Labs is planning to conduct research on the degree to which farm animal advocacy motivates the purchase of vegan products and on the effectiveness of online vegan outreach. Vegan Publishers has criticized the methodology and reporting of previous Humane League Lab studies.  Animal Charity Evaluators review  THL has been one of Animal Charity Evaluators' (ACE) top recommended charities since ACE's inception in August 2012. = 2018 review = In their 2018 review, ACE estimated that for an average $1,000 donation, THL would spend the marginal money as follows: *$420 to corporate outreach for better welfare policies *$320 on grassroots outreach, including leafleting, corporate campaigns, and humane education *$130 on online ads *$100 on communications and social media *$30 on studies through Humane League Labs The money is estimated to save roughly 4300 animals and prevent 1500 years of life on a factory farm. The bulk of these animals are chickens since THL focuses most of their corporate outreach on cage-free and broiler welfare policies. ACE states that THL has a funding gap of $350,000 to $5.3 million and could effectively put to use $10.1 million to $13.4 million before losing any effectiveness. This funding would likely be used to expand their volunteering program and to support the corporate adoption of cage-free laying hen policies through their sister organization, the Open Wing Alliance. = 2017 review = In their 2017 review, ACE estimated that for an average $1,000 donation, THL would spend the marginal money as follows: *$490 to corporate outreach for better welfare policies *$150 on grassroots outreach, including leafleting, corporate campaigns, and humane education *$140 on online ads *$100 on communications and social media *$90 on campus outreach *$30 on studies through Humane League Labs ACE states that THL could have used $600,000 to $3.5 million more funding in 2017 before losing any effectiveness. This funding would have likely been used for the growth of their UK office and to grow the Open Wing Alliance. = 2016 review = In their 2016 review of THL, ACE lists the organization's strengths as their strong efforts to assess and improve their own programs, its strong organizational structure and culture, and its track record of success. ACE's review raises concerns about THL's evaluation of the cost- effectiveness of its local offices, and suggests that THL more deeply engage with \\"big questions\\" relative to effective animal advocacy such as the value of focusing individual dietary change as opposed to building the animal advocacy movement and shifting social norms in general. ACE's 2016 review estimates that THL would allocate a $1,000 donation as follows: *$300 to corporate outreach for better welfare policies *$290 on grassroots outreach, including leafleting, corporate campaigns, and humane education *$250 on online ads *$120 on communications and social media *$40 on campus outreach ACE states that, as of this review, THL could use $1 million to $1.5 million more in funding in 2017 above their 2016 budget. This funding would likely be used to expand international work and their campus outreach program. = 2015 review = In their 2015 review, ACE estimated that for an average $1,000 donation, THL would spend the marginal money as follows: * $320 on online ads, leading to 3,000 online video views. * $450 on grassroots outreach, resulting in the distribution of about 1,319 leaflets and reaching about 7 students through humane education lectures. * $220 campaigning for cage-free egg and Meatless Mondays policies and about $10 on research. ACE estimated that THL could use $190,000 in funds from ACE-directed donors for the 2015 giving season. = 2014 review = In December 2014, ACE published its first detailed review of THL. According to the review: \\"THL‚Äôs most impressive accomplishment for us is not through any one of their programs, but through their overall outlook and approach to advocacy. Among animal advocacy organizations, they make exceptionally strong efforts to assess their own programs and to look for and test out ways of improving them. Their success in applying these techniques to their online ads program, and their publication of their research through Humane League Labs, has shifted the outlook and programming of several larger advocacy organizations toward finding the best ways to advocate for animals.\\" On the flip side, ACE raised concerns about THL not valuing transparency highly enough, and justifying local offices simply based on whether they brought as much money as they spent, rather than relative to counterfactual uses of money. ACE estimated that THL would spend a marginal $1,000 as follows: * $540 on online ads, leading to 2,160 online video views. * $150 on leafleting, resulting in the distribution of about 1,667 leaflets (Vegan Outreach bears the $400 cost of printing and shipping these leaflets). * $120 campaigning for cage-free eggs on college campuses or for Meatless Mondays in K-12 schools. * $10 on national corporate campaigns. ACE recommended moving $50,000 to THL but said they believed the organization was capable of absorbing up to $270,000.  Reception  THL's online vegan advocacy ads have been discussed and critiqued on LessWrong and by negative utilitarian Brian Tomasik. Partly as a result of the ACE recommendation, THL has been viewed positively in the effective altruism movement. Raising for Effective Giving lists THL as one of the charities it recommends giving to. The Chronicle of Philanthropy cited an example of an effective altruist who chose to pursue a career in finance so that he could pursue earning to give, donating large sums to The Humane League to help it spend more aggressively in pursuit of its goals. THL has been listed as a top charity by ACE since August 2012, with the most updated review in November 2018.

It served the Daubhill area of south west Bolton. It was open from 1831 until its replacement in 1885 by a later station. History The Bolton and Leigh Railway (B&LR;) opened for goods traffic in 1828, followed by passenger services in 1831. The railway was built as a single track line and the route included two inclines which were worked using ropes hauled by stationary engines, locomotive haulage being used on the flatter sections of the line. One of these inclines was situated at Daubhill with the line climbing up out of Bolton. This incline was operated by a stationary steam engine which hauled the trains up the incline, in the downhill direction trains worked by gravity. The station at Daubhill opened on 11 June 1831. The station site was not marked on contemporary maps, however the approximate site can be deduced: * A traveller in 1846 wrote to Herepath's Railway Journal with several complaints about the railway which had recently been taken over by the LNWR, one complaint read \\"passengers going to the Daubhill station, are compelled to go up a flight of some forty steps (frequently through a cloud of smoke and steam), alongside of, and over the top of a high-pressure boiler, which has been in use during the last 14 or 16 years.\\" The engine house is clearly marked on the OS six-inch map surveyed between 1844 and 1846. * Shaw (1983) reports that the first Daubhill station was situated alongside Tootal's \\"Sunnyside Mills\\" (opened in 1862) and that Tootal had in their offices a watercolour of their Mills, painted in 1864 showing the original Daubhill station and a passenger train proceeding up the line. Improvements in locomotive design meant the inclines became redundant, to avoid the incline, and allow steam locomotives to haul trains for the entire journey, the LNWR, successor to the B&LR;, built a deviation over easier gradients. This required the resiting of the 1831 Daubhill station. The station closed on 2 February 1885 and was replaced by a new Rumworth and Daubhill only a short distance away on the same day. The original Daubhill line was not simply closed, but sections at both ends were retained for many years, with only a short central section being closed and lifted immediately. The northern end was retained to serve the Crown Brewery (later Magee, Marshall's). The southern end of the old line survived to serve Sunnyside Mills and Daubhill Coal yard until the mid-1960s.

It was begun in 2008 by Rebecca Roth and Esmeralda Hern√°ndez Jos√©. The inspiration for the project was the making of a cloth doll by Roth for the young daughter of one of her cellmates. Hern√°ndez Jos√© noted the need for another means of earning income, so the two decided to make and sell the dolls, using scrap cloth. The program was successful, with about 100 dolls sold before Roth even left the prison in 2010. Since then more than 1,200 have been sold to collectors and other, primarily in Mexico and the United States. Since 2010, the project has sold dolls through the Feria Maestros del Arte, a major handcraft fair in Mexico. Origin of the dolls Edith Margarita Mu√±oz of Original Friends Dolls at the 2015 Feria de los Maestros del Arte in Chapala, Jalisco The dolls are the brainchild of Rebecca Roth, an American who moved to Puerto Vallarta in 1998. From then until 2006, she lived as a shop owner in the city. At age 47, Roth was arrested by Mexican authorities and from 2006 to 2010, was in a prison just outside Guadalajara while her case went through the system. The Mexican legal process is very long, with much time passing before a case is resolved. In the meantime, those arrested must stay in jail. While the prison has a pleasant common area with orange and lime trees as well as roses, along with a court for volleyball, tennis and basketball, she lived with thirteen other women in a prison cell meant for six people. The stress of prison life and legal limbo moved her to re-explore her creative interests as a coping mechanism, working on painting, drawing and writing poetry, as well as taking classes in Spanish and teaching English. One of the people in her cell block was a 15-month girl named Lupita, born at the prison because the Mexican prison system allows conjugal visits. It also allows the mothers of such children to keep them there until age three. However, the little girl had no toys, except for two empty plastic Coke bottles to kick around. Having taken some basic sewing classes, Roth made a doll for the girl, which had orange yarn hair, painted purple eyes, red lips, and freckles; and had a white blouse, with a multi-colored skirt. She was nothing like the later dolls, but Lupita immediately named her ‚ÄúMia‚Äù (mine) . Mother and child were later relocated to another facility, and then released. They now live ina small town outside of Puerto Vallarta. When Roth made the doll for Lupita, she had no idea that it would become something more. In 2008, one of her cellmates, Esmeralda Hernandez Jose, stated she needed to find a way to make money. Prisoners must earn the money they need for basic supplies. There are jobs at the prison but they pay very little. Roth‚Äôs suggestion was to make ten dolls similar to Lupita‚Äôs and put them in the upcoming prison art show to try and sell. This they did, and the first one of several sold was bought by the prison director. After that, guards, visitors and others began to order them. This success persuaded the women to continue the work and name the project Original Friends Dolls, at Hern√°ndez Jos√©‚Äôs suggestion. While she was still in prison, over 100 dolls were sold. The making of the dolls served as an outlet for her depression and frustration. Released in 2010 after an appeals court overturned her sentence for lack of evidence. As of 2015, Hern√°ndez Jos√© has not been sentenced. The project today Despite the experience Roth has decided to stay in Mexico and continue the project, working with volunteers both inside and outside Reclusorio Feminil of Puente Grande in Jalisco. The team the runs the project today consists of Roth, Hern√°ndez Jos√©, Edith Margarita N√∫√±ez Espinoza, and Sandra Ramos Aceves. Admiring the work of makers such as Eleanor Peace Bailey and Patti Culea, the dolls have evolved since the creation of Mia. However, 85-90% of the materials are still scraps, mostly from donations and other found items which are then recycled. These materials include fabric, ribbons, lace, buttons, paint, broken jewelry, seed pearls and various other odds and ends. Many of the donations are from people who have cleaned out closets and drawers to help the project. Each doll is unique, with a name, number and signed by the artist who made it. They come as a number of characters which include mermaids, fairies, dancers, witches and more. They also take special orders. The faces are hand- painted, and all dolls come with a unique outfit, underwear and some unique accessory. The dolls have been trademarked since 2011, and as of 2015, the project has sold over 1,200 dolls. They are sold at various outlets in Jalisco, such as in Ajijic, Chapala, Tlaquepaque and Puerto Vallarta, as well as on the Internet through Facebook, E Bay and Mercado Libre, and are regularly shipped to the United States. Since 2010, the project has been invited to participate in the Feria Maestros del Arte, a major handcraft and folk art show in Mexico. Roth has received photos of the dolls in their new homes from all over the world. The women who make the dolls, generally make one per week and are paid each Friday. Any profit from the sales is split between Roth and Hern√°ndez Jos√©. Roth still makes dolls, but less so because of the demands of travel and running the project. The program has grown, but is still limited to one prison, but now has a waiting list of women who want to participate. In 2013, Canadian photographer and collector of Original Friends Dolls Barbara Nettleson was allowed inside the prison to photograph the project.

The centre acts as the main hub for heritage and information services, and contains the East Riding Archives and Local Studies, the Beverley Library, a Museum and the Beverley Art Gallery. The building also contains a coffee lounge and gift shop. The top floor, known as 'The Tower', serves as an elevated sightseeing platform, showcasing 360 degree views of the Beverley Minster and the town of Beverley.  History  The original library on Champney Road in Beverley had been built and completed in 1906. Initial plans were drawn up in 1997 for an extension to the building, beginning with consultations and preparatory work being carried out by the Beverley Town Council, Beverley Civic Society and national organisations such as English Heritage and the Royal Fine Arts Commission. Work on The Treasure House started in October 2004, with local construction contractors Houlton engaging with archaeologists and the then Chairman of the East Riding of Yorkshire Council, Councillor Margaret Chapman. A time capsule was buried to mark the start of building work, with its contents reflecting life in the East Riding at that time. It was planned that the capsule would be resurrected in fifty years from its planting, intending to be brought out in 2054. Some of the items entered into it included contributions from local schools such as Longcroft School, with students producing coursework describing how they envisage the world to be in fifty years time. The initial completion date was stated as being autumn 2006, and it had been hoped that the building would open on the centenary of the opening of the library. Eventually, the building would be completed in 2007. The project had been funded through a grant of ¬£3.9 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund.  Publicly accessible areas  = Archives and Local Studies = At the main entrance of the Treasure House, the research room of the East Riding archives and local studies can be found. Members of the public have access to all of the books, microfiche resources, archive newspapers, documents, pictures and rare books of the East Riding. Experienced archivists are also available to assist with searches. To the left of the research room, there is a conservation workshop where large gallery windows allow viewing of conservators restoring pictures, books and other documents. = Beverley Library = At the end of the main corridor is the Beverley library, allowing access to all of the library resources including the lending and reference libraries, computers, newspapers and children's area. = Museum galleries = On the first floor there is a museum display of 'East Riding Treasures'. In addition to displays on the geology, natural history, landscape and people, there is the South Cave Weapons Cache, a nationally important display of Iron Age swords. In this gallery, there are also interactive activities for children, including puzzles, dressing-up costumes and a drawing table. In a neighbouring corridor, there is a gallery of temporary museum displays, which are frequently-changing and are often prepared by local community groups, or touring exhibitions from national museums or galleries. = Beverley Art Gallery = The first of two galleries displays pictures from a permanent collection. There is also a display chest which displays smaller themed collections. One of the main pictures on permanent display is The Panic, which is the world's largest cattle painting by popular English landscape and animal painter Henry William Banks Davis. The second of the two galleries has temporary art displays, which usually contain collections from either local artists, touring national exhibitions or displays from amateur art groups.

Collections. Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/3417 (1904) is an oil painting by Pablo Picasso completed during the artist's Blue Period (1901‚Äî1904). This evocative image, painted in neutral tones of blue and gray, depicts an emaciated woman with hollowed eyes, sunken cheeks, and bent form, as she presses down on an iron with all her will. A recurrent subject matter for Picasso during this time is the desolation of social outsiders. This painting, as the rest of his works of the Blue Period, is inspired by his life in Spain but was painted in Paris.Pablo Picasso's Blue Period - 1901 to 1904. Pablo Picasso - Paintings,Biography, Quotes of Pablo Picasso. http://www.pablopicasso.org/blue-period.jsp. Web Nov 21 2015 When Picasso painted Woman Ironing he was roughly 22 years old. Living in Paris, with little money, he would often start a painting on a canvas, abandon it, and later use the same surface to paint over a new work. Since 1989, when an infrared camera was used to examine Woman Ironing, art historians and conservators have been aware of the existence of another portrait beneath it. The work is part of the Thannhauser CollectionThannhauser Collection. Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. http://www.guggenheim.org/new- york/collections/collection-online/acquisitions/4 currently on display in the Thannhauser Gallery of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York.  Background  Picasso's artistic training began as a youth in Spain where traditions of realism, including academic classicism and Spanish genre, influenced him in various degrees. His devotion to the Catalan modernism movement in Barcelona, as well as his encounter with Post-Impressionist and Symbolist painting in Paris, had an important, although brief, impact on his oeuvre. During his Blue Period years between 1901 and 1904, Picasso moved back and forth between France and Spain.Rosenthal, Mark, Robert J. Boardingham, Jeffrey Weiss. Curators' Preface. Marilyn McCully, Ed. Picasso--the Early Years, 1892-1906. Washington: National Gallery of Art, 1997. Print. Woman Ironing was painted during a phase in his work that he developed once he settled in Paris in 1904. He was living in Le Bateau-Lavoir building in Montmartre at 13 Rue Ravignan along with many other artists. = The studio = During his Blue period years, Picasso's group of friends widened, and he became particularly close with poets Guillaume Apollinaire (1880‚Äî1918) and Andr√© Salmon (1881‚Äî1969). Salmon's recollection of his first visit to Picasso's studio provides us with glimpses of the artist's way of working: Regardless of the lack of gas or electricity, Picasso favored working at night. Before 1909, most of his paintings were done under the light of an oil lamp, hung above his head while he squatted on the floor in front of his canvas. When he could not afford to buy the oil, which was quite often, he held a candle with one hand while working with the other.Penrose, Roland. Picasso: : His Life and Work. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1981. Print.  Provenance  Ambroise Vollard, Paris; Der Neuer Kunstsalon, Munich; Moderne Galerie Heinrich Thannhauser, Munich, ca. 1913; Karl Adler, Berlin and Amsterdam, 1916; purchased from Adler by J.K.

Woman Ironing dates from 1904, the year when Picasso had permanently moved to Paris after visiting the city several times. Picasso's relationship with Ambroise Vollard (1866‚Äî1939), the first owner of the painting, began in 1901 when at the age of nineteen, Picasso approached the already established Parisian art dealer. In 1901, Vollard gave Picasso his first show in Paris. It was not a great success in Vollard's eyes as many of the works sold at low prices. The dealer refused to buy the unsold pieces, and it was not until the artist's reputation grew that Vollard made several important purchases. Their relationship lasted until 1939, and Vollard never offered Picasso a secure contract.Rabinow, Rebecca A, Douglas W. Druick, and di P. M. Assante.

Thannhauser (1892‚Äî1976), the last owner of the painting before he bequeathed it to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, was a critical figure to the advancement of modern art in Europe. Justin assisted his father Heinrich Thannhauser in managing the distinguished Moderne Galerie, established in Munich in 1909. In 1913, the gallery mounted the first major Pablo Picasso retrospective, which included Woman Ironing.Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Collections.

Guggenheim Museum. Collections. Thannhauser Collection. About. http://www.guggenheim.org/new- york/collections/about-the-collection/new-york/thannhauser-collection  Analysis  By using color and form to evoke notions about the subject of the work, Picasso depicts the laundress in neutral tones and in a tense, angular manner, expressing poverty, loneliness, and suffering.Krens, Thomas, Germano Celant, and Lisa Dennison. From Van Gogh to Picasso, from Kandinsky to Pollock: Masterpieces of Modern Art : Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, Thannhauser Collection. Milano: Bompiani, 1990. 104. Print. Picasso decontextualizes the woman by removing her from a specific place and time and keeps her anonymous, using her tired female body, hardened by challenge and labor, to generalize human tragedy. These generalizations, visible in his Blue Period and Rose Period works, are testament of Picasso's preoccupation with the universal, more than with particular human events and emotions, including his own.Art of This Century: The Guggenheim Museum and Its Collection/ the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. New York, NY: Guggenheim Museum Publ, 1994. 72-73. Print. Picasso deals with the laundress' occupation as a universal symbol. The theme is not only one of social compassion, but one hinting at the circumstances of an urban proletariat, which is larger than the reality of a single laundress.Drutt, Matthew. Thannhauser: The Thannhauser Collection of the Guggenheim Museum. New York, N.Y: Guggenheim Museum, 2001. 64-66 Print. Picasso is not the first to explore the theme of labor. During the late 19th and early 20th century, works such as Gustave Courbet's The Stonebreakers (1849) and Jean-Fra√ßois Millet's The Gleaners (1857) depicted the hardships of workers, bringing their untold stories to the forefront.Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Collection Online. Woman Ironing (La repasseuse). http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/3417 Daumier, Degas, and Picasso himself in 1901 had previously explored the subject of the laundress. The expressive pose in Picasso's 1904's Woman Ironing, was certainly inspired by Degas's Woman Ironing (ca. 1884‚Äî1886).Krens, Thomas, Germano Celant, and Lisa Dennison. From Van Gogh to Picasso, from Kandinsky to Pollock: Masterpieces of Modern Art : Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, Thannhauser Collection. Milano: Bompiani, 1990. 104. Print. Curiously, the same pose appears in The Blue Room, a 1901 Picasso painting. Idealized workers‚Äîportrayed as simple, strong souls that symbolized purity and virtue‚Äî were a large focus of Picasso's Blue Period. While these social, economic, and political complexities formed Picasso's sympathies, perceptions, and expressions, many scholars argue that his apparent interest is less ideological than dramatic. One can quickly draw the link between the representation of the underclass depicted in his canvases with Social Realism‚Äîa movement that criticized social structures maintaining the miserable conditions of the working class and the poor. But Picasso's relationship with his characters is a fictitious one, with little if any, Social Realism informing his vision of underclass life.Rosenthal, Mark, Robert J. Boardingham, Jeffrey Weiss. Curators' Preface. Marilyn McCully, Ed. Picasso-- the Early Years, 1892-1906. Washington: National Gallery of Art, 1997. Print. 1904 was a transitional year between Blue and Rose periods. Picasso successfully attempts to reduce the heaviness found in sculptural figures painted in dark-valued monochromatic hues, by lightening color and elongating form. These developments point to his Rose period, during which he consciously works on the elegance of the figures. Woman Ironing encompasses some of these developments. His art relaxes, the figure elongates, as well as becoming more artificial in gesture, with more angular extremities. Soft shades of pinks, blues, and browns reintroduce color to the canvas. The drawing becomes looser, and the pigments are applied more openly, in a wash-like form. While the woman is carefully outlined, the drawing becomes more fluid; this is particularly noticeable in the linear patterns of the hair.Millard, Charles W. \\"Picasso Brujo.\\" The Hudson Review. 34.1 (1981): 81. Print. The model that Picasso uses for Woman Ironing has been identified as the daughter of Fr√©d√©, the owner of the caf√© Le Lapin Agile, frequented by Picasso and his friends. Her name is Margot, and she appears in his other canvases from 1904.Krens, Thomas, Germano Celant, and Lisa Dennison. From Van Gogh to Picasso, from Kandinsky to Pollock: Masterpieces of Modern Art : Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, Thannhauser Collection. Milano: Bompiani, 1990. 104. Print.  Imaging and discoveries  In 1989, a study of Woman Ironing revealed an apparent portrait of a man underneath the surface of the 1904 work of art. It is important to note that this is not the only Picasso painting that has a hidden image underneath its surface. For example, when asked to discuss Seated Woman and Child, more than fifty years after its completion in 1901, it is reported that Picasso replied with a \\"touch of regret,\\" mentioning a lost work that lay beneath it. \\"Maybe one could still see it if one radiographed the painting,\\" he suggested. Early in his career financial constraints were certainly part of his motivations for reusing canvases. Even though an artist has the option of scraping off an earlier work, or covering an old image with an even coat of ground to prepare the surface for the new painting, Picasso did this very rarely. Instead, he reworked his paintings directly over earlier images without eliminating the previous attempt.Hoenigswald, Ann. \\"Works in progress : Pablo Picasso's hidden images\\". Picasso, Pablo, Marilyn McCully, Ed.. Picasso--the Early Years, 1892-1906. Washington: National Gallery of Art, 1997. Print. Conservators and researchers can generally recognize anomalies in a painting by observing variation on its surface with the naked eye. To confirm that these variations are the product of an earlier image, a number of technical means to look beneath the visible image can be used. X-rays and infrared light can penetrate the layers of a painting to reveal paint changes and an artist's reworking that are normally hidden from view. The infrared camera posed technological limitations that prevented further discoveries until recently. The need to revise the original restoration of the work conducted in the 1950s, as well as earlier imaging process and findings, led to an in-depth technical-scientific studyWoman Ironing.

Up to now, microscopic analysis revealed that the true colors of the male portrait include rosy flesh tones and a bright red necktie. The outcome images of x-radiography are superior to those of infrared in areas of the composition containing white lead paint, therefore the x-ray of Woman Ironing captures best the characteristics of the brushstrokes in areas such as the man's face and sleeve.Solomon R.

Influences on other artists  While it is difficult to deny the artistic genius of Pablo Picasso and his impact on the development of modern and contemporary art, it is also certain that most of his influence on other artist's works derives from later periods in his career. Woman Ironing directly inspired the work of artist Vik Muniz (1961‚Äî), a photographer and mixed-media artist, best known for repurposing everyday materials for intricate and heavily layered recreations of canonical artworks. His Woman Ironing (Isis),Muniz, Woman Ironing (Isis). Burger Collection http://www.burgercollection.org/welcome/artists/artist/contact1510.Muniz- Vik.html from the series Pictures of Garbage (2008), is a homage to Picasso's painting. Muniz collaborated with a team of men and women who earned their living by collecting recyclable materials. A woman named Isis Rodrigues Garros, who had ended up working at the landfill, became the woman ironing. Muniz engaged with Picasso's painting by depicting contemporary urban laborers.Post-Picasso Contemporary Reactions, Museu Picasso http://www.bcn.cat/museupicasso/en/exhibitions/temporals/post- picasso/html/ambit4-1.html See also *De strijkster (Woman Ironing) by Rik Wouters  References   External links  * Solomon R.

Reticulate Evolution: Symbiogenesis, Lateral Gene Transfer, Hybridization and Infectious Heredity. Springer. pp. 81-106. He was a critic of the Darwinian view of struggle for existence. He authored Evolution by Cooperation (1913) and Symbiogenesis (1915) which were influential in developing the concept of symbiosis.Sapp, Jan (1994). Evolution by Association: A History of Symbiosis.

According to science historian Jan Sapp \\"Reinheimer is virtually unknown among contemporary biologists and historians.\\" Reinheimer coined the term \\"bioeconomics\\" in 1913. In 1915, Reinheimer was one of the first writers to discuss symbiogenesis. However, the term was used without reference to Konstantin Mereschkowski who had previously written on the subject, leading cell biologist Francisco Carrapi√ßo to speculate that Reinheimer was unfamiliar with Mereschkowski's work. Reinheimer was a vegetarian. Little about his life is known, he was described as living in Surbiton, London in the 1950s. Reception Reinheimer's book Nutrition and Evolution described the importance of nutrition as a factor in evolution. A review in the Nature journal suggested that \\"the conclusion is sound, but we cannot say this of many of the arguments.\\" His book Evolution by Co-Operation received a mixed review in the British Medical Journal which concluded that it is an \\"interesting and suggestive work\\". Reinheimer's views on symbiogenesis were seen as controversial during his time. In 1916, American zoologist William Lawrence Tower described his book Symbiogenesis as the \\"least logical, worst constructed, most inaccurate and irrational book upon evolution that has happened in a long time.\\" Other reviews were more positive. For example, the Scientific American commented that \\"even though one may not wholly surrender to Mr. Reinheimer's argument, or accord to his theory that supreme importance with which he invests it, there are in his volume so many important related facts, and so much pause-compelling suggestion, that his work must be reckoned with in any future study of Nature's methods.\\" The book was positively reviewed in The Lancet journal which concluded it would be read with interest by many biologists. Anthropologist Ashley Montagu wrote that Reinheimer's book Symbiosis \\"which is all too little known, presents a very stimulating and well-balanced account of the facts\\".Montagu, Ashley. (1952). Darwin: Competition & Cooperation. Henry Schuman, Inc. p. 134 The book was criticized by botanist C.

It was declared a sister parish of a shrine also dedicated to Kim-Taegon in South Korea in 1986. Seoul Archbishop Stephen Cardinal Kim gave a statue of Andrew Kim-Taegon to the parish which was then enshrined on the old church building. The construction of the new church building (Project Pangarap) began in 2001 under the parish priest at the time, Avel Sampana. The construction coincided with the 50th anniversary of the parish. Today the parish priest is Rev. Fr. Vicente \\"Vic\\" Robles, the former rector and parish priest of the National Shrine of the Divine Mercy in Marilao Bulacan. The church is to be dedicated to the Korean saint Andrew Kim Taegon, the first Korean-born Catholic priest in the Philippines in the early 18th century. During the Joseon Dynasty, Christianity was suppressed in Korea and many Christians were persecuted which led to Kim-Taegon fleeing to Lolomboy in Bocaue in the Philippines where he lived as a seminarian. He was ordained a deacon and later a priest in China before leading a group of French missionaries to convert people to Christianity in Korea. He was arrested and sentenced to death in Korea as a traitor. He was beatified by Pope Pius XI in 1925 and canonized by Pope John Paul II in May, 1984.

The epithet describes any person who thoughtless defends, idolizes and fawns a populist politician and demagogue, and who takes the same attitude as a religious fanatic. Similar terms in other Spanish-speaking countries include perroflautasin Spain, zurdos in Argentina, mamertosin Colombia, comunachosin Chile and \\"√±angaras\\" in Venezuela.  Etymology  In the 1960s, a chairo or chaqueto was a term used to refer to an adolescent who was believed to masturbate in excess and as a result was self-absorbed or distracted. The words have connection to chaqueta mental, literally mental jacket. In her blog at El Universal, prominent blogger Tamara De Anda relates how she and her friends first tried to popularize chairo in high school to describe \\"neo- hippie\\" students that would take up camp in the best part of the school's garden. She describes these students as beautiful and self-assured, that they wore fashionable clothes, went to raves and took acid and MDMA. Although they came from nice homes in the south of Mexico City (see Jardines del Pedregal and San √Ångel). De Anda and her friends would mock these students as elitists and fake as they claimed to be left-wing whilst going to protests in their best clothes. At this point to de Anda, the chairo was viewed as cool for the things that their wealth provided them. The word started to acquire its current meaning in the mid 2000s. De Anda gave new impetus to the word circa 2004 when she began to use it in her blog, Plaqueta, and to jokingly describe her left-leaning friends. In 2005, while de Anda attended the Facultad de Ciencias Pol√≠ticas y Sociales, she created a satirical documentary titled Los Chairos which consisted of interviews with the \\"chairos\\" of Mexico City. The popularity of her blog helped increase views for the video and helped disseminate the term. Chairo then began to deform from describing something cool and fun to a word used to indicate and mock those who were demonstrating against the system. De Anda self-describes as a chaira and has expressed discontent with the word's usage to denigrate dissenting views.  Stereotype  The term has been further popularized by social media and now encompasses a large array of attributes. Most commonly seen as a 20-something college student, the term has also been extended to journalists, academics, writers and artists. Common traits attributed to the chairo include: an expansive leftist-anarchist ideology, some sort of nationalist view (sometimes grounded on indigenismo), being indignant and fighting \\"the System\\" and globalization. They may be against what they believe to be \\"Zionism\\" and \\"American imperialism\\". A chairo is sometimes seen as a radical that sympathizes with Socialism that is in line with Chavismo. Other stereotypes include wearing Che Guevara shirts and smoking marijuana or ingesting peyote. As well as adhering to the philosophy of Noam Chomsky and reading the works of Eduardo Galeano. According to the Diccionario del espa√±ol de M√©xico, compiled by the Colegio de M√©xico, a chairo is an offensive adjective used to describe individuals that defend social and political causes that are in contrast with the political right, however they lack real commitment to the causes defended; an individual that is autosatisfied with their own attitudes.Diccionario del Espa√±ol de M√©xico (DEM) http://dem.colmex.mx, El Colegio de M√©xico, A.C. Retrieved 4 October 2018. A picture of writer Daniel Malpica (editor of Radiador Magazine) became a popular image macro of the \\"typical chairo\\".

Small differences are in the individual replicas of characters and minor details. So, for example, the story mentions only that Kovalev wrote a letter to Podtochina, and the text of the letter is given. The film also shows Subtotal and her daughter at the time they receive and read the letter. In the final, the film and the story completely diverge. In the story Kovalev, having found his nose in the same place, continues to live a normal life. In the film Kovalev gets back his nose, a new rank, marries and dies from an overabundance of feelings.

Young. Robert A. Young (1824-1902) was an American minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. A descendant of slaveholding planters, he served as a minister in many churches in Tennessee, Alabama and Missouri in the Antebellum South. He served as the President of Florence Wesleyan University (later known as the University of North Alabama in Florence, Alabama from 1861 to 1864. He supported the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War, and he did not believe in the \\"social equality of the Negro\\" after the war. He was a founding trustee of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. Early life, family background and education Robert A. Young was born on January 23, 1824, in Campbell's Station, Knox County, Tennessee. His father, Captain John C. Young, was a graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and \\"a large farmer and slaveholder\\" in Knox County, Tennessee, who died when Young was only six years old. He had two sisters and two brothers, including Robert R. Moore, another Methodist minister. His paternal grandfather, Henry Young, immigrated from England to the United States as a ship-carpenter, settling in Baltimore, Maryland. His mother, Lucinda Hyder, was born in Carter County, Tennessee; her ancestors had immigrated to the United States from Germany. His maternal grandfather, John Hyder, was \\"a large farmer\\" in Carter County, while his maternal uncle, Michael Hyder, served in the Tennessee legislature, representing the same county. Young was raised in a Presbyterian family, but he joined the Methodist Episcopal Church, South in 1842. He graduated from Washington College, a Presbyterian college, in 1844. One of his classmates was Zebulon Baird Vance, who later served as the Governor of North Carolina. Young studied medicine briefly with a physician in Rheatown, Tennessee, but he decided to serve the Methodist Episcopal Church instead. As a minister, he received a master of arts degree from Jackson College in 1850. Additionally, he received a Doctor of Divinity from Florence Wesleyan University during the civil war. He was the recipient of a Legum Doctor from Washington College in 1895. Career Young first became a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South in Dandridge, Tennessee in 1845. He was recommended by Reverend Alexander Little Page Green to serve as minister for the Cumberland Iron Works from 1846 to 1848. He became a deacon in 1848 and an elder in 1850. He then served as minister in Columbia, Tennessee from 1848 to 1850, and in Huntsville, Alabama from 1850 to 1852. He turned down the offer to serve as President of the Florence Wesleyan University (a precursor to the University of North Alabama in 1852, and served as a minister in Lebanon, Tennessee for one year and in St. Louis, Missouri for two more years instead. He served as an elder of the St. Louis district of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South from 1855 to 1857, when he became presiding elder of its Lexington District until 1860. He briefly served as minister in Lebanon, Tennessee in the fall of 1860. During the American Civil War, Young was a staunch supporter of the Confederate States of America. He served as the President of Florence Wesleyan University in Florence, Alabama from 1861 to 1864. He was a minister in Columbia, Tennessee in 1864 until he became minister of the Tulip Street Methodist Church in Edgefield, now East Nashville, in 1865. He served as the minister of McKendree Methodist Church from 1866 to 1870. In the late 1860s, Young was the author of A Reply to Ariel, an essay about the ethnology of blacks. The essay was a response to a racist text entitled The Negro, authored by Buckner H. Payne under the pseudonym of \\"Ariel,\\" which suggested blacks harked back to Eve's affair with a \\"subhuman beast\\" (sic). Even though Young \\"unashamedly admitted to anti-black prejudices\\" and failed to believe in the \\"social equality of the Negro,\\" Young offered a scientific criticism suggesting there was only one human species regardless of skin color, citing Carl Linnaeus, George S. Blackie and Louis Agassiz. Young served as the minister of Elm Street Methodist Church from 1870 to 1874. He was the editor of Advocates of Mission, a Methodist publication.

The increased length of the Castle class over their predecessorsChesneau, p.63 and their improved hull form gave the Castles better speed and performance on patrol in the North Atlantic and an acceptable replacement for the Flowers.Brown 2007, p.142 This, coupled with improved anti-submarine armament in the form of the Squid mortar led to a much more capable anti-submarine warfare (ASW) vessel. However, the design did have criticisms, mainly in the way it handled at low speeds and that the class's maximum speed was already slower than the speeds of the new U-boats they would be facing.Brown 2007, p.127 A Castle-class corvette was long with a beam of and a draught of at deep load.Brown states the beam at and the draught at The ships displaced standard and deep load.Chesneau states the displacement at deep load as The ships had a complement of 120.Brown states the complement as 99 and Johnston states the complement of Canadian ships at 112 (7 officers and 105 ratings). The ships were powered by two Admiralty three-drum boilers which created . This powered one vertical triple expansion engine that drove one shaft, giving the ships a maximum speed of . The ships carried 480 tons of oil giving them a range of at . The corvettes were armed with one QF 4-inch Mk XIX gun mounted forward.Mk XIX = Mark 19. Britain used Roman numerals to denote Marks (models) of ordnance until after World War II. This was the nineteenth model of British QF 4-inch gun Anti-air armament varied from 4 to 10 Oerlikon 20 mm cannons.Brown 2007, p.126 For ASW purposes, the ships were equipped with one three-barreled Squid anti-submarine mortar with 81 projectiles. The ships also had two depth charge throwers and one depth charge rail on the stern that came with 15 depth charges. The ships were equipped with Type 145 and Type 147B ASDIC. The Type 147B was tied to the Squid anti-submarine mortar and would automatically set the depth on the fuses of the projectiles until the moment of firing. A single Squid-launched attack had a success rate of 25%.Brown 2012, p.129 The class was also provided with HF/DF and Type 277 radar. Construction and career Guildford Castle, named for Guildford Castle in Surrey, was ordered on 19 January 1943. The ship was laid down on 25 May 1943 at Henry Robb Ltd in Leith and launched on 13 November 1943.Macpherson and Barrie, p.163 At some point during 1943, the ship was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy.Colledge, p.297 The corvette was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 28 February 1944 as Hespeler with the pennant number K489. The ship was named for Hespeler, Ontario, a community in southern Ontario. Following her commissioning, Hespeler worked up at Tobermory. The ship was then assigned to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force as a member of the convoy escort group C-5. From April 1944 until the end of the war, Hespeler performed convoy escort duties, taking part in the largest convoy of the war, HX 300. On 9 September 1944, while on patrol south of the Hebrides, Hespeler, in conjunction with the attacked and sank the . Spotted by a Short Sunderland from 423 Squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Force which attacked the submarine using depth charges, the aircraft then directed three ships to U-484. Hespeler attacked the submarine using her Squid anti-submarine mortar, and after the explosions spotted large air bubbles coming to the surface.Paterson, p.40 The credit for the kill has been disputed by other sources, claiming that the attack was directed at non-submarine targets.Niestl√©, p.69 In March 1945, Hespeler returned to Canada and began a refit upon arrival at Halifax. The refit was completed in July at Liverpool, Nova Scotia and following it, the corvette sailed for Esquimalt, British Columbia. Following her arrival, Hespeler was paid off into the reserve on 15 November. =Mercantile service= In 1946, Hespeler was sold for mercantile use to Union Steamships Ltd. of Vancouver. Converted into the passenger ship Chilcotin, Union Steamships paid $25,000 to purchase the vessel, and another $400,000 to convert ex-Hespeler into the passenger ship.Johnston, p.221 The converted ship had a gross register tonnage of 1,837 tons. Chilcotin sailed between Alaska and Vancouver until 1957 when Chilcotin was sold to Sunline Inc. She underwent a refit in 1957 and began service as Capri in 1958 operating under a Liberian flag. In 1960, her flag was transferred to Panama and the ship was renamed Stella Maris.Miramar claims that Capri was renamed Stella Maris in 1958 and that the port of registry was changed to Panama at the same time. Stella Maris was used to give round-trip cruises on the Saint Lawrence Seaway, starting from Montreal. In 1965, her flag returned to Liberia and the ship was renamed Westar. While en route from Greece to Vancouver, on 28 January 1966 the ship was refueling at Sarroch, Sardinia when a fire broke out in her engine room. The ship was beached and one Canadian and one British sailor were killed and three others injured. Westar was taken to La Spezia, Italy to be scrapped on 30 April 1966.

Birch was born in New Orleans, and currently lives and works in New Orleans. He completed his BA at Southern University in New Orleans, and received an MFA from Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore, Maryland. Work Birch lived in New York after graduate school, where he became known for papier-m√¢ch√© sculptures. While in New York, during the years 1978 and 1979, he was part of the Cultural Council Foundation Artists Project, funded by the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA). Reviewing an exhibition at Exit Art in New York City, Roberta Smith described his 1990s work in the New York Times as \\"a storytelling art carried out with immense visual expertise.\\" Birch moved back to New Orleans in 1994, and in 1997 he began working on a series of portraits of people in his neighborhood. Birch conceptualized the project as a protest against stereotypical images of African-Americans that he saw in the French Quarter: \\"Stores offered degrading posters, figurines and cards; and street performers used buffoonery to present stereotypical characters.\\" Birch explained that the rest of the city was very different, concluding, \\"These two contradictory images of New Orleans offered me the opportunity to visualize a body of work that addressed the idea of perception and how we as human beings continue to create, perpetuate, and define peoples as the 'other,' and what that implies in a changing society.\\" The resulting monotypes were printed at the Tamarind Institute. Birch started working exclusively in black and white after 2000. The resulting large-scale drawings were featured in Prospect.1 in 2008, the triennial exhibition of contemporary art in New Orleans organized by Prospect New Orleans. He typically works in charcoal and acrylic on paper and his images often feature aspects of daily life in New Orleans as well as elements of the city's traditional culture, including brass bands, second lines, and musicians such as Trombone Shorty. Birch was one of six artists featured in \\"Ten Years Gone\\" at the New Orleans Museum of Art on the occasion of the ten-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina in 2015. His work featured images of the plants that took over his yard while the city was closed down after the storm, as well as bronze casts of crawfish mounds, the mud dwellings built by crawfish that had been displaced to his yard by the storm. Exhibitions Birch's work has been exhibited across the US, including Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art; The McKinney Avenue Contemporary Museum in Dallas; Delaware Center for the Contemporary Arts, Wilmington, DE; and Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art, Winston-Salem, NC; and Sculpture Center, New York City. Residencies Birch has been an artist in residence at RedLine Milwaukee; New Orleans Center for Creative Arts; and Ecole superieure des beaux-arts de Nantes, France; New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Foundation; Tamarind Institute, Albuquerque, NM; Henry Street Settlement, New York; and The Studio Museum in Harlem, NY. Grants and fellowships Birch has served as the James Baldwin Fellow for the United States Artists, and has received the Life Time Achievement Award from the National Conference of Artists (NCA). Birch has received fellowships from The Pollock Krasner Foundation, The Joan Mitchell Foundation, Cue Art Foundation, the Guggenheim Foundation, New York State Council on the Arts, and the National Endowment for the Arts. He has received the Governor's Award from the state of Louisiana and the Mayor's Arts Award from New Orleans.

The group had just been dropped by Atlantic Records but eventually signed to 550 Music after they reissued the parent album. The track was written by Dominique Durand, Adam Schlesinger and Andy Chase, with the latter two producing it. It is a pop and alternative pop song that features the use of horns and was compared to the works of the Smiths. It was released as a CD single in two different formats, with the commercial release featuring two previously unreleased bonus tracks and the promotional release featuring just the album version of \\"This Is the Day\\". Music critics liked the track, with most considering it a standout track and noting the possibility of it making Apartment Life more successful.  Background and release  \\"This Is the Day\\" was taken from Ivy's second studio album Apartment Life which was released on October 7, 1997 by Atlantic Records. It was prominently featured in the 1998 American comedy film There's Something About Mary and was also included on the film's official soundtrack. Reflecting on its usage in the film, Durand commented that it was unimaginable to see their songs in several scenes and that she \\"fe[lt] so grateful to have something like that in a movie\\". The song was recorded in 1997 in New York City at three different recording studios. Despite Atlantic Records signing Ivy earlier in 1997, they were later dropped and picked up by 550 Music. Following its inclusion on the film, the aforementioned label distributed the song to radio stations across the United States on October 19, 1998, in addition to releasing it as a CD single in the United States; two formats were created, with the commercial release including bonus tracks \\"Sleeping Late\\" and \\"Sweet Mary\\" and the promotional featuring just the album version of the single. Additionally, 550 Music reissued Apartment Life in the United States with new cover art and digitally remastered tracks, while both Schlesinger and Chase opened up a new recording studio titled Stratosphere in New York City in June 1999. Furthermore in the late 1990s, \\"This Is the Day\\" would be included on the Pepsi-issued album Pepsi Pop Culture (1998) and the 1999 compilation album titled Live a Little, Vol. 1.  Composition  \\"This Is the Day\\" was written by Dominique Durand, Adam Schlesinger and Andy Chase, with the latter two also serving as producers. Musicians Paul Q. Kolderie and Sean Slade served as the mixers, with Matthew Ellard being an assistant to them; additionally, Bob Ludwig finalized the mastering. Additionally, fellow musician James Iha contributes backing vocals to the track. A pop and alternative pop song, Durand sings about an ended relationship, with the chorus consisting of her saying, \\"She's never com-ing back\\". Noting the use of \\"60s-ish horns\\", Jack Rabid from AllMusic called its genre \\"la-la-la pop personified\\". The addition of horns was brand new for Ivy, as they tried to incorporate more instruments into the songs on Apartment Life. Also regarding the horn section, Kurt B. Reighley from CMJ New Music Monthly joked that the Smiths must have \\"overlooked\\" the song and its \\"punchy melody\\". Agreeing, Vickie Gilmer and Ira Robbins from Trouser Press compared it to the same group and called it a \\"jaunty\\" track.  Critical reception  \\"The Best Thing\\" received favorable feedback from music critics. Frank Tortorici of MTV News used the track to prove that Ivy was much different than Schlesinger's other band Fountains of Wayne; he compared the sound to Blondie and called it \\"bouncy\\". He also felt that the track would give Apartment Life the much \\"needed push\\" in order for it to be a successful release. In addition to \\"The Best Thing\\" (1997) and \\"You Don't Know Anything\\" (1999), AllMusic's Rabid called the single one of the \\"pleasantly produced, precisely structured pop dreams that makes fans sing along\\" on Apartment Life. An editor at ROCKRGRL felt that given \\"This Is the Day\\", Ivy should have \\"gained more than a moment's attention\\". Hans Koller and Joyce Grenfell, contributors to The Encyclopedia of Popular Music, considered \\"This Is the Day\\" and \\"Baker\\" as the two best tracks on Apartment Life. Additionally, a Sputnikmusic member noted in their album review that \\"if you only have a dollar\\", the listener should \\"download th[is] track\\".

It is a family-run business that was founded in 1816‚Äîreputedly the oldest continuously operating family boatbuilder in the United States. Hodgdon Yachts is noted for building superyachts, both sail and power, using advanced composite materials and construction techniques. It's also noted for its ability to incorporate those advanced materials into traditional designs that employ modern electronic and mechanical marine systems. The company has several divisions‚Äîyachts, custom tenders, yacht interiors, yacht services and military composites with offices in Boothbay, Maine, Newport, Rhode Island and Monaco. History Bowdoin at anchor off Sable Island, Nova Scotia SC 2 submarine chaser USS Accentor YMS-1-class minesweeper, USS YMS-324 In 1816, founder, Caleb Hodgdon with brother Tyler, added boatbuilding as \\"Hodgdon Brothers\\" in East Boothbay on the Damariscotta River to Caleb's sawmill and gristmill businesses with the construction of a 42-foot \\"pinky\\" fishing schooner, Union, launched in 1818. From 1850 and 1895 the yard built and launched 24 commercial schooners. Caleb turned the business over to sons, C. George and James P. Hodgdon, in 1870. Successive generations of Hodgdons maintained the business, as siblings left and returned from boatbuilding enterprises, elsewhere in Maine. The business regained vitality during the Korean War, when it built twelve naval patrol boats. A fire destroyed most of the yard's buildings and records in 1954 during this run of producing patrol boats. Within three years, brothers William and Charles, and George I., Sr. died. George I. (\\"Sonny\\") Hodgdon, Jr., who was born in 1922 and reputedly started work in the yard at an early age, rebuilt the boat-building sheds and obtained a contract to build the first boat designed by William Tripp Sr., Katingo. In addition to securing contracts to build boats for noted designers, including Sparkman & Stephens, John Alden, and L. Francis Herreshoff, he designed and built 24 small vessels, between 1956 and 1969. In 1969, Hodgdon moved to another facility to build lobster boats under the business name of \\"G.I. Hodgdon, Co.\\" Hodgdon's son, Timothy, joined the business In 1979 and steered the company towards modern materials. He continued after his father died in 1995 and, as business grew, diversified the company into six divisions, specializing in yacht construction, custom tenders, yacht interiors, boatyard services, and composite materials for military customers. He established a variety of locations in Maine, Rhode Island, and Monaco. In 2016, a sixth-generation Hodgdon family member to participate in the firm, Audrey Hodgdon, was appointed as director of sales and marketing. Notable vessels The business built most of its notable vessels under the name, \\"Hodgdon Brothers\\", through the 1970s and then, with the advent of Timothy Hodgdon and diversification, continued under the corporate banner of \\"Hodgdon Shipbuilding.\\" =Hodgdon Brothers= The vessels built in East Boothbay at the Hodgdon Brothers shipyard were predominantly wood construction and included fishing vessels, an arctic schooner, small naval vessels, and several yachts. Schooners Hodgdon Brothers yard was building wooden schooners well into the 20th century, they included: * The fishing schooner, Elizabeth W. Hunan, was the last of a series of five vessels built for the Nunan family, which ran a fishing enterprise out of Cape Porpoise, Maine. The 96-foot auxiliary powered vessel was launched in 1908 and reportedly was in service for 30 years. It had an 80-horsepower Globe auxiliary engine, which could propel her at 9 miles per hour. * The schooner, Bowdoin, was designed by William H. Hand, Jr., and built in 1921. It is the only American schooner built specifically for Arctic exploration, and was designed under the direction of explorer Donald B. MacMillan. As of 2015, it had made 29 trips above the Arctic Circle, three since it was acquired by the Maine Maritime Academy (MMA) in 1988. As of 2015, it was based in Castine, Maine, where it is used for the MMA sail training curriculum. Naval ships Hodgdon Brothers built wood-hulled naval patrol boats, starting in World War I through the Korean War. Wooden hulls do not activate magnetic detonators on mines or torpedoes. They were, as follows: * Two SC-1-class submarine chasers, SC-137‚Äîcommissioned December 14, 1917‚Äîand SC-138‚Äîcommissioned January 24, 1918. The SC-1 class was a class of submarine chasers produced during World War I for the United States Navy in order to combat attacks by German U-boats, with 441 boats built from 1917 to 1919. They were overall and carried one 3-inch (76.2-mm)/23-caliber gun mount, two Colt .30 caliber (7.62 mm) machine guns and one Y-gun depth charge projector. * A Accentor-class minesweeper, in partnership with neighboring shipyard, Goudy and Stevens. It was named, USS Combat (AMc-69), launched on 6 October 1941 and renamed USS Bulwark (AMc-68). It carried two .50 cal. M2 Browning machine guns. * Twelve YMS-1-class minesweepers with a overall length, armed with one 3-inch/50 caliber gun mount, two 20 mm guns and two depth charge projectors in the 1950s. Yachts Hodgdon Brothers specialized in building wooden yachts. The 1960s began a transition to fiberglass yachts. * The 67-foot motor yacht, Maimelee, was at its launching in 1961 the largest fiberglass yacht in the world. The hull was molded in England, shipped to East Boothbay and finished by Hodgdon Brothers. It was equipped with twin 308-horsepower diesel engines, air conditioning for cruising in southern waters and an electronic suite that included a radio direction finder, a fathometer and radar. * Noted naval architect, John Alden, chose Hodgdon Brothers to build two schooners and one sloop. In 1975, Alden selected Hodgdon Brothers to build a fiberglass 61-foot motorsailer yacht. =Hodgdon Shipbuilding= Comanche leaving Newport, Rhode Island for Plymouth, England in the 2015 Rolex Transatlantic Race Windcrest near Bar Harbor, Maine Scheherazade during sea trials The company's adoption of composite technology began in 1984 with the order of an 83-foot composite motor yacht, which was launched as Yorel, and which required a bigger yard building, new boatbuilding technology and a high standard of craftsmanship. This project marked the change in boatbuilding approach by president-to-be, Timothy Hodgdon, then 29 years old. Yorel returned to Hodgdon Yard, renamed as Kizbul, for a major refit in 2013. The company offers yacht and tender building and repair services under the name, Hodgdon Yachts, and military vessel construction and composite components for vessels under the name, Hodgdon Defense Composites. Yachts The company's yacht division is known as \\"Hodgdon Yachts\\"; notable projects include: * Comanche‚Äî100-foot monohull, launched October, 2014‚Äîwas designed by VPLP and Guillaume Verdier and was completed within 13 months. With an overall length of , it vied to be the world‚Äôs fastest monohull with a 24-hour distance record of during a 2015 race across the Atlantic, subject to ratification by the World Sailing Speed Record Council. In December, 2014 it placed second in the annual Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race. In 2015, it was first in the same race, covering 628 nautical miles in just under two days and nine hours. With a beam it achieves speed similar to performance multihull sailing craft by being sailed heeled one on one edge to minimize wetted surface. In April, 2015 Comanche broke the course record at the Les Voiles de Saint Barth yacht race. At the time of its building, Comanche's hull represented \\"one of the largest single-hull infusions\\" [of composite materials] performed in the United States. * Windcrest‚Äî98-foot ketch, launched July, 2008‚Äîwas designed by Fontaine Design Group. The vessel employs composite (cold-molded, wood-epoxy) construction and was 406th vessel launched by the Hodgdon family since 1816. As specified by owners, it was designed for extensive coastal cruising. It features an interior joinery of cherry and walnut with fabrics and leather complementing the natural woods. The yacht features hydraulic, electrical, water, mechanical, communications and ventilation systems, together with push-button sail-handling, satellite e-mail communications systems for entertainment, phone and e-mail, all monitored with a computer network with nine screens. It placed third out of 47 sailing superyachts in the 2015 St Barths Bucket Regatta, a \\"gentlemen's\\" yacht race. * Scheherazade‚Äî ketch, launched September, 2003‚Äîwas designed by naval architect, Bruce King, and built with composite construction, using \\"western red cedar, Douglas fir, divinycell, balsa core and carbon, all epoxied and vacuum bagged\\" to mold the hull structure. The interior features sycamore and walnut with many carved decorative features. Scheherazade participated in the 2008 Superyacht Cup Ulysses Nardin in Palma de Mallorca and, in 2012 and 2013, twice won the Shipyard Cup in Boothbay Harbor. It was renamed Asolare in 2014. At the time of its launching, Scheherazade was reportedly the largest sailing yacht built in the Americas. * Antonisa‚Äî sloop, launched August, 1999‚Äîwas designed by Bruce King for an Italian owner, who reportedly was drawn to Hodgdon's reputation. It features detailed interior and exterior woodwork‚Äîmatched with exotic, advanced materials that include aluminum honeycomb composites and carbon-fiber‚Äîand a pipe organ in the cabin. * Liberty‚Äî commuter, launched 1997‚Äîwas designed by Bruce King and is described by the builder as having a \\"strong, light hull with distinct round transom\\" and top and cruising speeds of 33 knots and 25 knots, respectively. The design employs a narrow beam to allow the craft to slice through seas at a higher speed than vessels of similar displacement. The hull is laminated with cedar and mahogany. The construction saves weight with an aluminum honeycomb deck having a teak veneer that resembles traditional wood deck planking. Additionally, the underwater foils and shaft struts are of carbon fiber, instead of bronze. Yachting Magazine chose Liberty as one of its dozen notable yachts, stating that it \\"celebrates the great commuter yachts of the 1920s and 1930s‚Äîa significant period of yachting history‚Äîyet she is built of modern materials, employs up- to-date engines and systems.... Liberty represents the best of old and new.\\" Tenders Feadship yacht, A2, with Hodgdon Yachts \\"Mini Venetian Limo Tender\\" As a result of building a custom yacht tender‚Äîa vessel that ferries passengers from a large vessel to shore‚Äîfor Steven Spielberg's super yacht, Seven Seas, Hodgdon saw a market for such craft and developed two tender sizes in two configurations‚Äîopen and \\"limo\\" (with a roof that raises up)‚Äîfrom . According to the company's specifications, their top speeds are 34 and 36 knots respectively. Military vessels A Mark V Special Operations Craft launching a ScanEagle UAV The company's defense products division is known as \\"Hodgdon Defense Composites\\". On January 11, 2008 Hodgdon and the U.S. Navy unveiled an experimental version of the Mark V Special Operations Craft, designated the Mk V.1, designed to reduce the number of injuries sustained by sailors and SEALs during the operation of the aluminum version of the vessel. Nicknamed the MAKO, the vessel was developed by a subsidiary of Hodgdon Shipbuilding, in collaboration with the University of Maine's Advanced Engineered Wood Composites Center. It features a hull made of layers of carbon fiber, a foam core and an outer layer of Kevlar for additional strength. It was constructed and launched at the Hodgdon Yachts East Boothbay facility. The MAKO is lighter than the current Mk V. The Office of Naval Research funded the prototype ‚Äúto compare the properties of composite construction with aluminum‚Äù versions of the same craft. In 2012, the Hodgdon Defense Composites division received several military contracts to produce rescue boats that resemble personal water craft, small enough to be air-dropped from a C-130 military cargo plane, yet able to penetrate rough surf. The 12-foot vessel is called the Greenough Advanced Rescue Craft (GARC) and employs a 143-horsepower engine, driving a pump-jet. Such craft reportedly have a range of up to at and can carry four people. The craft was developed for the United States Air Force Special Operations Command.

Born in India, she worked on women's rights and welfare issues in her native country in the 1930s and 1940s. In 1950 she and her husband moved to Singapore to help spread the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. In Singapore, she became a champion against marriage inequality and polygamy; she was instrumental in the founding of the Singapore Council of Women and of the nation's Syariah Court, and was a leader in the advocacy effort that saw the Women's Charter become law. Following the death of her husband in 1958 and the passage of the Women's Charter in 1961, she moved to Thailand for 14 years, during which time she established a school for girls at risk of being forced into prostitution. Early life Shirin Fozdar was born in Mumbai (then known as Bombay), India in 1905. Her parents, Mehraban Khodabux Behjat and Dowlat, were Persian practitioners of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. One of the teachings of the Bah√° º√≠ religion is that men and women are equal, and at the age of 17, she gave a presentation on universal education at the Baha'is of India National Convention in Karachi. By the 1930s she was involved in the All Asian Women's Conference, which sent her to give a presentation on equality at a League of Nations conference in Geneva in 1934. She continued to give public speeches, and in 1941 gave a speech on peace in Ahmedabad at the behest of Mahatma Gandhi. Singapore In 1950, Fozdar moved to Singapore with her husband, medical doctor Khodadad Fozdar, seeking to spread the Bah√° º√≠ teachings. In 1952, she co-founded the Singapore Council of Women (SCW) along with other activists representing existing women's organizations. Fozdar was one of the leaders in pushing for the meeting that led to the establishment of the SCW, and in that initial meeting helped shape the group's vision and agenda. She was elected to serve as the group's honorary general secretary, sending its early communications to the media and politicians. The group was the first women's political action organization, and with over 2,000 members, was the largest such group for five decades. One of the issues that attracted Fozdar's immediate attention was marriage inequality; the laws governing marriage and divorce gave the husband the power to easily divorce and remarry, and left the wife with little recourse. In an interview, Fozdar explained that \\"When I first came here, the rates of polygamy and easy divorce were alarming. Marriage laws were lax. Women suffered all kinds of atrocities because men held the belief that women were the weaker sex.\\" Fozdar and the SWC campaigned intensely for a solution, and in 1955 a Syariah Court was set up to address the issue. The court had jurisdiction over marriage and divorce, could order husbands to pay alimony, and before polygamy was outlawed, could force a husband to secure his first wife's consent before marrying a second wife. The book Our Lives to Live: Putting a Woman's Face to Change in Singapore credits Fozdar, Che Zahara binte Noor Mohamed, and Khatijun Nissa Siraj as the main forces behind the court's formation. During the 1950s, the Fozdar and the Singapore Council of Women had an inconsistent working relationship with the People's Action Party (PAP), which was founded in 1954 on the platform of Singaporean independence from Britain. The SWC hoped to get the PAP to make women's equality issues, especially the abolition of polygamy, a core part of their agenda. The PAP was at times strongly receptive, and in 1956 gave Fozdar an opportunity to speak on the issue of polygamy at a Women's Day rally organized by the party. However, by 1957 the SWC was so frustrated with the PAP's inaction on women's equality issues that it urged SWC members to run as independent candidates, rather than as PAP candidates, in that year's City Council elections. The PAP was the only party to eventually put women's rights and anti-polygamy language in their charter, though, doing so in their 1959 election manifesto. The PAP swept that year's elections, in significant part because due to support from women voters. Fozdar moved quickly, urging the party to pass a women's rights bill first proposed in 1954. The legislature took the issue up in 1960, using the 1954 proposal as a framework, and in 1961 the Women's Charter became law. The bill outlawed polygamy, provided women with legal recourse against husbands that conducted adultery or bigamy, and contained a number of other provisions that protected women and girls. According to the Singapore Women's Hall of Fame, which inducted Fozdar in 2014, her activism was instrumental in the Charter's passage. Later life Fozdar's husband died in 1958, and in 1961 Fozdar moved to rural Thailand where she set up a school for girls, with the aim of empowering women against being forced into prostitution. She spent 14 years in the country before returning to Singapore. Archived in Singapore & I.R.O., p. 35. She traveled internationally, continuing to give speeches on women's rights issues as well as on the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. Shirin Fozdar died of cancer on 2 February 1992. She had three sons and two daughters.

The bill was discussed in the 2014 winter session of the assembly, and was approved by a vote of 188 to 1. It was officially enacted on 26 December 2014 and came into force the following day. It is Thailand's first animal welfare law. Its principal mandates are to impel animal owners to provide appropriate care and shelter, and to stop the illegal meat trade. The act also covers animals in nature, to the extent determined by the agricultural minister who is in charge of the act. It prohibits neglect, torture, and uncaring transport, usage, as well as show of live animals. Neglect includes improper housing and transportation of animals which may lead to injury and death. An offense is punishable by law, which may impose a maximum two years-term in prison, and fine of up to 40,000 baht (US$1,663), or both. Background Thailand is infamous for its stray animals, particularly cats and dogs. It is a centre of major illegal dog trade for meat. In addition to domestic use, dogs are exported to China and Vietnam. These animals are cramped up in bags or cages in transit sometimes resulting in death. There are also numerous reports of pet thefts. Many pet owners dump unwanted animals on the street. Thailand had no specific legislation for acts of cruelty to animals. There is a minor criminal code under which cruelty to animals is punishable by a maximum one month in prison and a 1,000 baht fine. But the code does not clarify what cruelty is, and was never enforced. Groups such as the Thai Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and the Soi Dog Foundation, led a global campaign resulting in pressure on the Thai government to take action. Kiatiyos Roger Lohanan (aka Roger Lohanan), founder of Thai Animal Guardians Association, lobbied against dog eating which initiated the drafting process in 1999. He continue to lobbie lawmakers A major breakthrough came in April 2012 when the Animal Activist Alliance of Thailand (AAA), collaborating with 30 other animal protection groups protested in front of the parliament. As a result, a parliamentary sub-committee was created to address the draft bill. It had representatives from Thai Animal Guardians Association, The Voice Foundation and Thai Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. since. A major breakthrough came in April 2012 when the Animal Activist Alliance of Thailand (AAA), collaborating with 30 other animal protection groups protested in front of the parliament. As a result, a parliamentary sub-committee was created to prepare a draft bill to address the torture and abuse of animals. It had representatives from various animal welfare organisations. The draft bill titled \\"Prevention of Cruelty and Animal Welfare Provision Bill\\" was discussed and voted at the November session of the National Legislative Assembly. It was passed on 12 November by a vote of 188 members for, one against, and four abstentions. The act came into effect on 27 December 2014 as \\"Prevention of Animal Cruelty and Provision of Animal Welfare Act 2014\\". Features The main objective of the act is to ensure adequate care of animals. The animals protected by this act are those normally raised as pets, raised for work, raised as beasts of burden, raised as friends, raised as livestock, raised for performance, or raised for any other purpose, with or without owners, and including wild animals as designated by the minister in charge of the act (agricultural minister). The act defines cruelty to animals as \\"any action or inaction that causes animal to suffer physically or psychologically, induces pain, illness, disability, or death, including using of disabled, ill, aged, or pregnant animal for exploitation, for sexual activity as well as over working animal or inappropriate work in case of illness, aging or under aging.\\" Although there is only one article in specific to cruelty and 20 exclusions from such in the law, it does implies against various forms of abuse and dog eating. The act permits designated officials to search vehicles, homes or businesses without a warrant in urgent situations. Deserted and injured animals without owner are also protected and can be provided for by the designated officials. Animal owners are compelled to follow the Five Freedoms principle of animal welfare, namely from hunger or thirst, from discomfort, from pain, injury or disease, from fear and distress, and Freedom to express normal behavior. = Rejected proposals = There were 20 specified acts of cruelty proposed by animal rights groups included in the draft bill that were not approved. The major points omitted are intended as guidelines against cruel action often found, such as burning animals alive, placing rival animals together, animal fight, eating live animals, etc. Enforcement The first offense of the act was reported in January 2015. Kamdee Kotata, a 50 year-old villager in northeastern Nong Khai Province, was arrested by police officers on 5 January. After a dog bit his chicken, the man threw knife at a dog, cutting the dog's face.

She participated in three actions, two against the French and one against the Dutch. She left the EIC's service in 1799 and traded between London and Lisbon until 1802 when new owners from Embden renamed her Reine Louise de Prusse and returned her to trading with the East Indies. Asia is last listed in Lloyd's Register for 1808 on the London- Batavia trade. EIC voyages =EIC voyage #1 (1781-83)= Asia, under the command of Captain Robert Maw, sailed from Portsmouth on 13 March 1781, bound for Bombay and China as part of a convoy of Indiamen accompanying a British squadron under Commodore George Johnstone.Lloyd's List no. 1250 - accessed 2 August 2015 At about the same time as the British sailed, a French squadron under the command of Bailli de Suffren left France. Both squadrons were en route to the Cape of Good Hope, the British to take it from the Dutch, the French aiming to help defend it and French possessions in the Indian Ocean, including Rodriguez Island, Ile Bourbon (R√©union), √éle de France (Mauritius), and Pondicherry. The British stopped at S√£o Tiago to take on water, with Asia arriving on 10 April. The French squadron attacked the British on 16 April in the battle of Porto Praya. Due to the unexpected nature of the encounter, neither fleet was prepared to do battle, and the result was an inconclusive battle in which the French warships sustained more damage than did the British. Though the battle was inconclusive, it did enable the French to forestall the British attack on the Cape. The British sailed on to the Cape, with Asia arriving there on 21 July. At the Cape, Johnstone captured five Dutch East Indiamen at the battle of Saldanha Bay. The British Indiamen then sailed on, directly, or indirectly, to India. Asia sailed to Johanna, which she reached on 3 September. The convoy left Johanna on 21 or 22 September, but ran into an adverse monsoon that drove the vessels to the coast of Arabia; the four Indiamen Asia, Latham, Locko, and Osterley were driven further, to Kissen Bay, near the Bab-el-Mandeb. The Indiamen were carrying the 2nd Battalion of the 42nd (Highland) Regiment of Foot. They remained there for some six weeks as the indigenes were friendly and the vessels could procure fresh food. The Highlanders entertained the indigenes with bagpipe music, and danced the Highland Fling; the indigenes reciprocated with a war dance involving shields and spears. The Indiamen arrived at Mocha on 4 December. Asias log book puts her at \\"Qishm\\" on 5 December. Whether this was Qeshm, and she was not with the other three, or \\"Kissen Bay\\", is currently an open question. They then sailed out of the Red Sea, with Asia reaching Bombay on 4 March, two days before the others. A voyage that would take a coppered vessel not facing adverse winds about two-and-a-half weeks had taken the four Indiamen five-and-a-half months. Asia left Bombay on 8 August in company with the Indiamen Locko. , and Osterley, and the country ship Shah Byram Gore. As the squadron was sailing through the Strait of Malacca, on 9 September the ships encountered the 38-gun French frigate Pourvoyeuse, which was under the command of Captain de Lannuguy-Tromelin. After an engagement the next day that lasted some two-and- a-half hours and in which Osterley had two men killed, and Locko and Essex had several men injured from exploding cartridges, Pouvoyeuse withdrew. On 5 October Asia reached Whampoa anchorage. On 4 January 1783, Locko, Osterley, and Asia left Whampoa. On 22 January Locko parted company with Essex and Osterley in the straits of Lombon by one account, and on the 23rd near Caremata ((), by another account.Lloyd's List, no. 1483. Locko and Asia then parted company on 30 January at \\"St Clement's Bank Peels Morcop\\". These are probably \\"St Clement's Reef\\" and \\"Pulo Mancap\\", at the lower end of the Karimata Strait. Asia reached St Helena on 17 June and arrived at The Downs on 28 October. After the return to Britain of the four captains of the Indiamen that participated in the action on 10 September 1782, the EIC awarded them prizes. Robert Maw received a silver salver made in 1787 by Joseph Heriot, of London, and inscribed \\"The Gift of the Hon‚Äôble East India Company to Robert Maw Esq‚Äôr Commander of the Asia East Indiaman for gallantly defending the said ship against a French frigate of 44 guns in the Straights of Malacca September, 1782.\\" =EIC voyage #2 (1785-86)= Captain John Davy Foulkes left Portsmouth on 10 March 1785, bound for Benkulen and China. Asia reached Bencoolen on 2 July. She then sailed to Padang, which she reached on 5 Aug, before returning to Bencoolen on 19 August. Asia arrived at Whampoa on 30 October. She left on 5 March 1786, reached St Helena on 24 June, and arrived at Blackwall, London, on 20 September. =EIC voyage #3 (1788-89)= Captain Foulkes left Portsmouth on 5 April 1788, bound for Bombay and China. Asia reached Johanna on 6 July and arrived at Bombay 20 days later. She reached Batavia on 25 November, and arrived at Whampoa on 8 February 1789. She reached St Helena on 25 June and arrived at Blackwall on 3 September. =EIC voyage #4 (1791-92)= Captain Foulkes left The Downs on 26 April 1791, bound for Madras and Bengal. Asia reached Madeira on 9 May and arrived at Madras on 10 September. On 8 November she arrived at Diamond Harbour. Asia returned to Madras on 3 March 1792, and sailed to Benkulen, which she reached on 18 April. She then reached St Helena on 26 August and arrived at Blackwall on 2 November. =EIC voyage #5 (1794-95)= Captain John Davy Foulkes received a letter of marque on 6 December 1793. The British government held her at Portsmouth, together with a number of other Indiamen in anticipation of using them as transports for an attack on √éle de France (Mauritus). It gave up the plan and released the vessels in May 1794. It paid ¬£1,500 for having delayed her departure by 72 days. Foulkes sailed Asia from Portsmouth on 2 May 1794, bound for Madras and Bengal. She reached Madras on 11 September and arrived at Diamond Harbour on 15 October. Homeward bound, she passed Saugor on 16 December. By 31 January 1795 she was at Madras again, and then by 24 May she was at St Helena. Between 14 and 18 June Asia participated in the capture of seven Dutch ships off St Helena. When arrived at St Helena in May she brought the news that France had invaded the Netherlands in January. Furthermore, under an order dated 9 February 1795, Royal Navy vessels and British letters of marque were to detain Dutch vessels and cargoes and bring them into British ports that they might be detained provisionally. Then on 2 June the British East India Company packet ship Swallow arrived from the Cape of Good Hope with the news than a convoy of Dutch East Indiamen had left the Cape, sailing for the Netherlands. Captain Essington, of Sceptre formed a squadron to try and intercept the Dutch. Providentially, the General Goddard, an East Indiaman under the command of Captain William Taylor Money, was resting at St Helena while on her way back to England. The small squadron intercepted eight Dutch vessels, which surrendered on 15 June. The EIC ships , Captain Samuel Maitland, and Asia arrived on the scene and helped board the Dutch vessels. There were no casualties on either side. The British then brought their prizes into St Helena on 17 June. By 13 September Asia had reached the River Shannon and by 27 October she was at Blackwall. Because the capture of the Dutch vessels had occurred before Britain declared war on the Batavian Republic, the vessels became Droits to the Crown. Still, prize money, in the amount of two- thirds of the value of the Dutch ships amounted to ¬£76,664 14s. Of this, ¬£61,331 15s 2d was distributed among the officers and crew of Sceptre, General Goddard, Busbridge, Asia, and Swallow. The remainder went to the garrison at St Helena, and various vessels in the St Helena roads. Thirty-three years later, in July 1828, there was a small final payment. =EIC voyage #6 (1796-98)= Captain Foulkes left Portsmouth on 12 April 1796, bound for Madras, Bengal, Bombay, and China. By 21 July Asia was at Simon's Bay, and she reached Madras on 16 November. On 20 December she was at Trincomalee before returning to Madras on 4 January 1797. She arrived at Kedgeree on 1 February. She then followed the Indian coast to Anjengo, which she reached on 17 April, and then Mah√© on 30 April and Bombay on 7 June. She reached Penang on 3 September, and arrived at Whampoa on 20 December. Asia reached St Helena on 5 August 1798, and arrived at Blackwall on 9 November. Later career In 1799 Beatson & Co., London, purchased Asia to sail between London and Lisbon. The Register of Shipping for 1802 shows her master as L. Strong, her owner as Beatson & Co., and her trade as London transport.Register of Shipping (1802), Seq.‚Ññ804. Then on 31 February 1802 Beatson sold her to buyers in Embden, who renamed her Reine Louise de Prusse. She returned to the Far East trade.

The original structure was built in Gothic architecture in 1829 by Gurukula Vamsha Varnakula Mudaliars, a gang of boatmen who were serving the East India Company. St. Peter's Church is a working church with hourly prayer and daily services and follows Roman Catholic sect of Christianity. The chapel was controlled by Vicar Apostolic initially and then split into two churches namely St. Peters and St. Antony's based on the two divisions of Gurukula Vamsha Varnakula Mudaliars, with the former supporting Irish Mission and the latter supporting Goanees. In modern times, it is under the dominion of Archdiocese of Madras. It is one of the most prominent landmarks of Royapuram. Architecture The church is built in Gothic architecture. The altar houses conventional Catholic images and prayer halls for the devotees. The plaques of St. Peter, St. Anthony, Jesus Christ, Chindadri Matha are housed in glass chambers in standing posture on the walls facing the devotees, while the image of Child Jesus is located in an open chamber around the sanctum. There is a school and set of shops located in the compound around the Church. History Royapuram is believed to have attained its name from St. Peter's Church. In Tamill, Peter indicates Royappar and puram is used to denote place of residence. Gurukula Vamsha Varnakula Mudaliars were a group of boatmen, who helped the naval ships reach the dock. They settled in Fort St. George in Madras Presidency around 1710. Around 1730, they were moved to Chepauk, by which time the community grew as a prosperous one as boat owners, boatmen and fishermen in the region. During the war in 1746, when the French captured Fort St. George, the community fled with the British to Fort St. David at Cuddalore. The community moved back along with the British and were aiding the British in all the vessels that landed. They were thus favoured by the British East India Company. During 1829, Lord Edward Clive asked them to move out of Fort St. George and allocated 720 grounds of land at a place, which would go on to be called Royapuram. The started building a church in 1825 and consecrated it in 1829 with contributions from the Gurukula Vamsha Varnakula Mudaliars and Secretary of Marine Board. The administration of fund lead to litigation with the High Court. The chapel was controlled by Archdiocese of Mylapore initially. Two factions of Gurukula Vamsha Varnakula Mudaliars developed over a period, with one supporting Irish Mission and the latter supporting Goanees. During 1848, the fighting intensified and the Goanees supporters built the St. Antony's church opposite to the St. Peter's Church. Residents in the area believe that the Church compound saved a lot of lives during the 1962 cyclone. The litigation continued during the 20th century when the legal battle between the Mudaliars and the Archbishop resulted in the Church getting closed for 14 years from 1935-49. It was subsequently ruled by the High Court that the income from the shops and schools around the Church were given to the Archbishop. There was a higher appeal in Supreme Court, which affirmed the rule of the High Court. Worship practises St. Peters Church was originally under the dominions of the Cathedral and later changed hands to Petiti Seminaire School Fathers up to 1860. The priests in the church were originally only French, but during modern times, Tamil people were also allowed. In modern times, the Church is administered by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Madras and Mylapore. Mass is performed in the church at 5 AM, 6 AM and 5 PM during weekdays (Monday to Friday ). On Saturdays, service is offered at 5 AM and 6 AM, while on Sundays the service is at 5 PM . The festival of the church is celebrated during the Christmas times for eight days, starting with flag hoisting on 24 December and ending with a feast and religious lectures on 2 January each year.

Design  Patagonia was a steam-sail armoured cruiser with steel hull and wooden planking, and armoured conning tower. It was propelled by two compound horizontal engines, and two masts with brick sails. It was equipped with two searchlights, two small steam boats, and five smaller boats with oars. As designed, its main battery was one 250mm Armstrong gun at the bow, and one 150mm Armstrong gun at the stern and on each side; with Vavasseur mountings protected with armoured shields. The secondary battery had four 87.5 mm and two 65.2mm Armstrong guns. It also mounted eight Nordenfelt machine guns and six Gardner machine guns. In 1899 the 250mm gun and two 150mm guns were removed, and the remainder artillery was redistributed.  History  Patagonia was ordered in 1885 to the shipyard Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino in Trieste at a cost of ¬£ 100,000; this transaction was widely criticized in Argentina as the Austro-Hungarian navy was purchasing ships in England rather than locally. The ship was launched in 1886; its construction was completed that year. After finalizing trials, it departed Trieste on January 20, 1887, arriving in Buenos Aires on February 28 same year. In January and February 1902 it participated in the naval exercises as part of the 3rd Division; it simulated a blockade of the River Plate in which it was successful.

With his dark-brown studio tones and forceful depiction of trivial subjects, Stobbaerts was a pioneer of Realism and 'autochthonous' Impressionism in Belgium.'Flemish Art from the Beginning Till Now', Arch Cape Press, 1988, p. 543 Life Jan Stobbaerts was born in Antwerp as the son of the carpenter Maarten Jozef Stobbarts and his wife Johanna Rosalie Pardon. Orphaned at the age of 6, Stobbaerts was cared for by various poor family members and remained unschooled. When he was 8 he became an apprentice of a joiner and later changed to another boss who specialized in making covers of tobacco boxes. Later he worked as an assistant of a decorative painter. He started to paint his own compositions, which he sold on the street.Georges Eekhoud, Jan Stobbaerts, in: Onze Kunst, Voortzetting van de Vlaamsche School, Hoofdredacteur P. Buschmann Jr., Deel XV 8ste Jaargang, 1st halfjaar Januari- Juni, 1909, p. 18-33 He became a pupil of the animal painter Emmanuel Noterman in 1856.Edmond-Louis de Taeye, 'Les artistes belges contemporains: leur vie, leurs oeuvres, leur place dans l'art', Castaigne, 1894 , p. 60-78 Dredging in the Woluwe Stobbaerts contributed his first painting to the salon of Brussels in 1857. His submission to the salon was received well by the critics and was purchased by a British buyer. He started to contribute to all salons in Belgium from that time onwards. In his early works, Stobbaerts worked from nature and he was thus one of the pioneers of non-academic painting. In 1859 he started attending the evening classes at the Academy of Fine Arts of Antwerp. Here he met Henri de Braekeleer who became a lifelong friend and fellow rebel against academism in art. Their rebellious attitude caused both of them to be expelled from the Academy. The uncle of de Braekeleer was Henri Leys, the leading Romantic painter in Belgium at the time. Leys took it upon himself to assist his nephew and Stobbaerts in the continuation of their training. Stobbaerts married in 1868 and he led a relatively sedentary life in his native Antwerp. He never left his country and only traveled in the immediate vicinity of his residence to paint the surrounding landscape of the Campine. In 1886 Stobbaerts moved to Brussels. In this city he was recognized as an important artist unlike in his native Antwerp where he often had conflicts with local art critics and organizers of exhibitions.Andre A. Moerman, Jan Stobbaerts - Na de middag, in: Openbaar Kunstbezit Vlaanderen 1965 His composition entitled The stable of the old farm of Cruyninghen, which had been refused for the salon of Antwerp in 1885, was purchased by the Belgian state the next year for the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium.The stable of the old farm of Cruyninghen at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium In Brussels Stobbaerts was feted by 'Les XX' (The Twenty), an association of 20 progressive artists in Brussels.Herwig Todts, 'Goya, Redon, Ensor: Grotesque Paintings and Drawings', Antique Collectors' Club, 2009 Les XX invited Stobbaerts to participate in the salon of 1884 organised by them.Hoeve aan de Woluwe at Erfgoedinzicht.be Leading art collectors in Belgium such as Henri Van Cutsem started collecting his work. While living in Schaerbeek near Brussels, he painted scenes in the Ossegem neighborhood of Sint-Jans-Molenbeek and around the Woluwe river. Slaugthering Stobbaerts received various officials awards including the award by the French state of the L√©gion d'Honneur in 1900 and by the Belgian state of a knighthood in the Order of Leopold in 1911.Dictionnaire des peintres belges at Belgian Art Links and Tools Jan Stobbaert's grandson Marcel Stobbaerts (1899 - 1979) was a successful artist.Marcel Stobbaerts, La partie de cartes at the Loterijmuseum Work Stobbaerts painted pictures of artisans, landscapes, animals and still lifes. He occasionally painted portraits and at the end of his career he created a few history and symbolistic paintings. His preferred subjects were low-life paintings of farm yards and barns. He was one of the first artists to start open-air painting in Belgium and he was one of the pioneers of Realism. The naturalistic realism of his composition Slaughtering caused a stir when it was displayed at the Antwerp salon of 1872. The painting shows a butcher cutting the throat of a cow in the front of the scene and the blood flowing out into a container. Stobbaerts demonstrated in this work his rejection of the idealistic subjects, which were common among the academic artists working in Belgium at the time, and that the depiction of a craft was a sufficient ground to select it as a subject for a painting. The Slaughtering was followed by many depictions of livestock farming including cattle and horses. The interior of a windmill While in his early works he painted scenes with pets in kitchen interiors in which the genre and anecdotal elements prevailed, from 1880 onwards stables and barns became a dominant theme in his work. The compositions in this period were painted with an almost photographic realism. His sober monochrome palette developed to a more balanced color scheme and he gave more attention to the effect of light. Around 1890, Stobbaerts' style underwent a considerable change likely under the influence of his discovery of Impressionism and his personal search for resolving the problem of light. Stobbaerts abandoned the detailed realism in favour of a very personal sfumato of light. His style became velvety, his brushwork looser and the paint more fluid. His paintings of the 1890s depicting scenes around the river Woluwe were made with an opaque, somewhat transparent paste. The artist concentrated on the effect of light and the forms, while they remained recognizable, became less clear as if seen through a soft focus lens. The subject matter itself became less important. In his later works he abandoned his realistic themes and started to paint scenes inspired by Symbolism. An example is the Bath of roses, which shows a nymph-like woman who submerges in a bath of roses and remains unreal and impossible to grasp.Saskia De Bodt, Maartje de Haan, Wim Pijbes, 'Bloemstillevens uit Nederland en Belgi√´, 1870-1940', Kunsthal Rotterdam, Waanders Uitgevers, 1998, p. 28 Stobbaerts is the author of several etchings, which deal with a similar subject matter as his paintings.Adrien Jean Joseph Delen, 'Modern Belgian Etchers and Copper Engravers' Belgian Government Information Center, 1951, page vii References Bath of roses External links Belgian genre painters Belgian portrait painters Belgian printmakers 19th-century Belgian painters 20th-century Belgian painters People from Antwerp 1838 births 1914 deaths 20th-century printmakers ","title":"Jan Stobbaerts"},{"id":"48619090","text":"Nate Riles is a retired professional football player that played in the Canadian Football League.

He came to office by assassinating his elder brother Thawun Gyi while Toungoo's overlord Pinya was facing a serious rebellion at Sagaing. His own rebellion was brief as he struck a deal with Pinya to keep the office in exchange for his submission. He died in 1324, and was succeeded by his son Saw Hnit. Early life Thawun Nge was the younger son of Thawun Letya, the ex- governor of Kanba Myint () and Kya-Khat-Wa-Ya () (both in modern Taungoo District). He was born after 1256. According to the regional chronicle Toungoo Yazawin, he was born in Pyu where his father had been placed under house arrest since 1256 by a rival governor from a Mon state to the south,Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 17 which most likely was Pegu (Bago).The chronicle Toungoo Yazawin does not mention the exact name of the rival governor or the exact state over which he ruled. But he was most probably Governor of Pegu, not the rebellious Gov. Shwe of Nga Shwe of Martaban, who per (Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 340‚Äì341) was in revolt for the first three years of Narapati's reign: (1) Pegu was the immediate Mon-speaking state to the south of Kanba Myint; (2) Chronicles do not say that the rebellion spread farther north to Dagon or Pegu; per (Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 340‚Äì341), the Pagan army began the Martaban campaign from Dagon; (3) Even after the Martaban rebellion was put down in 1259, Thawun Letya remained confined to Pyu until his death in 1279. Thawun Letya would likely have been restored to office if the arresting governor were Shwe of Martaban. The fight between the rival governors took place during a brief interregnum following the death of King Uzana of Pagan (Bagan) May 1256. At the capital Pagan (Bagan), a power struggle broke out between Crown Prince Thihathu and his half-brother Narathihapate. The court-backed Narathihapate emerged winner by November 1256.Than Tun 1964: 134Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 337‚Äì338 Since Thawun Letya remained under house arrest until his death in 1279, he may have backed Thihathu. Thawun Nge had an elder brother named Thawun Gyi, who like him was also born in Pyu. The brothers grew up listening to their father's constant reminders about their royal descent from King Sithu II of Pagan‚Äîthe two brothers were two-times-great-grandsons of Sithu II‚Äîand their rightful claim to the Kanba Myint region, which was given in fief to their ancestor Ananda Thuriya by Sithu II. Their father died in early 1279. Per Toungoo Yazawin, his last words to his two sons were to reclaim their rightful land.Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 18 Deputy ruler of Toungoo After their father's death, the two sons along with the followers (370 households) left Pyu for the north.The detention sentence apparently did not apply to the sons. And/or a new governor of Pegu had been appointed, and the new governor did not enforce the detention. According to the Mon chronicle Razadarit Ayedawbon (Pan Hla 2005: 29‚Äì30), Pagan appointed an ethnic Mon, A-Kha-Ma-Man, as governor of Pegu 1278/79, who after about seven years, in 1285, successfully revolted. They decided to settle at a location, about 55 km from Pyu and about 40 km south of Kanba Myint. It was named Toungoo (Taungoo) (, \\"Hill's Spur\\") because of its location by the hills in the narrow Sittaung river valley between the Bago Yoma range and southern Shan Hills. The date of foundation was 17 April 1279.Hmannan Yazawin (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 161) says the city was founded on 9th waxing of Kason 641 ME (Thursday, 20 April 1279). Toungoo Yazawin (Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 19) agrees with the date 9th waxing of Kason 641 ME but also says it was a Monday. It means 9th waxing is probably a typographical error. The actual date was probably Monday, 6th waxing (not 9th waxing) of Kason 641 (Monday, 17 April 1279) since Burmese numerals ·ÅÜ (6) and ·Åâ (9) are very similar. According to Toungoo Yazawin, Thawun Nge was the more ambitious of the two brothers. He wanted the top job but had to relent as Thawun Gyi became the ruler by primogeniture. Thawun Nge settled for being the deputy.Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 19 Toungoo became independent in 1287 when its overlord Pagan fell due to the Mongol invasions. Thawun Gyi never submitted to King Kyawswa (r. 1289‚Äì97), who ruled only around Pagan, but submitted to the Myinsaing rulers later at an unspecified date.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 372, 376 By the 1310s, Thawun Nge was getting impatient; he had been waiting in the wing for over three decades. His opening came in 1315 when Toungoo's overlord Myinsaing‚ÄìPinya faced a rebellion at Sagaing. What began as a minor thinly veiled insurrection by Prince Saw Yun against his father King Thihathu grew serious by March 1316 when Saw Yun completely fortified Sagaing.Yazawin Thit Vol. 1 2012: 161, fn-3 Thihathu sent two expeditions to retake Sagaing but both failed.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 375‚Äì376 Thawun Nge decided that it was time to remove his brother. On or right before the beginning of the Buddhist Lent that year (23 June 1317), his men assassinated Thawun Gyi in the precincts of the Tayahte Pagoda (modern Myat Saw Nyi-Naung Pagoda).Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 19‚Äì20 Ruler of Toungoo Thawun Nge was now finally the ruler. But by having assassinated Thawun Gyi without Pinya's permission, he was also in revolt. He was not alone, however. Toungoo's neighboring state, Taungdwin had also revolted. Thihathu did send an army led by Crown Prince Uzana, which laid siege to Toungoo. Thawun Nge successfully negotiated a deal to keep his office in exchange for his submission to Pinya.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 372 He ruled for seven more years before his death in 1324.

Registered as N3598F, it had been based in the United States from its construction until 1995 when it was sold to a New Zealand company by RTS Aircraft Services Corp of Montvale, New Jersey. While flown in the United States, on 21 July 1990 ZK-HKU struck telephone lines while hovering about a meter above the ground. The main rotor blades severed the lines which then became entangled in the tail rotor causing its blade to snap and separating the rotor gearbox and tail boom from the helicopter.Aviation database, N Number: 3598F On 19 April 1998 ZK-HKU had been involved in an emergency landing at Rotorua. It had suffered an engine failure. According to the air accident report the pilot made an autorotational landing onto uneven terrain. No one was injured but during the heavy landing its skid landing gear, tail boom and main rotor blades were damaged.TAIC, Report 98-005 - Aerospatiale AS350D (ZK-HKU) in-flight engine failure, Rotorua, 19 April 1998 Before being sold to Alpine Helicopters it had been owned by Christchurch Helicopters Accident At the time of the crash (about 11 am NZDT), the weather was reported to be heavily overcast and raining. The aircraft crashed into a crevasse approximately up Fox Glacier. According to Alpine Adventures' quality assurance manager, Barry Waterland, the helicopter crashed just after taking off from the glacier at a designated spot called The Chancellor. When the helicopter was reported as being overdue the pilot's flatmate, Thomas Darling, took another helicopter up to try to find them. On finding the crash site, Darling alerted the rescue coordination centre and an emergency service helicopter flew up to the crash site.

The police announced that a further attempt would be made on Wednesday that week. The area where the helicopter crashed was described as highly treacherous, uneven, and moving ice, with 20-metre crevasses. The blocks of ice were described as bigger than buildings. On 24 November police announced that post-mortem procedures on the four recovered victims had been completed and that they consisted of three women and a man. The weather cleared for an hour on 25 November allowing recovery teams consisting of Police, Alpine Cliff Rescue, and drone operators to land on the glacier. The drone then filmed the site before the weather again closed in. The remaining three bodies and most of the wreckage were recovered from the crash site on 26 November. In late March 2016 more helicopter parts were recovered from the crash site by professional mountaineers employed by the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC). The parts had become visible due to snow melt during the summer months.Fox Glacier helicopter wreck parts retrieved, Joanne Carroll, 13:14, 1 April 2016, retrieved 21 April 2016 The body of one of the British women was found on the glacier on 2 March 2017 and formally identified on 15 March 2017. Crash investigation In November 2015 TAIC advised that it could take until May 2017 for its Chief investigator of accidents Captain Tim Burfoot to complete the investigation into the cause of the crash. The recovered wreckage of the helicopter was taken to TAIC's Wellington site for evaluation. The father of one of the victims of the 2010 New Zealand Fletcher FU24 crash expressed a lack of confidence in TAIC's ability to properly investigate the crash based on destruction of evidence from that crash and New Zealand's lax approach to air safety. The helicopter engine was sent to its United States manufacturer for inspection under TAIC's investigators supervision. Flight control components were sent to Australia for testing and inspecting and a team from the helicopters French manufacturer have also inspected the wreckage held in Wellington.

The TIAC report into the crash was released on 23 May 2019. The investigation determined that there was no apparent fault with the helicopter and cited the operator's pilot training system as not fully prepare the pilot for his role. TIAC also found that the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) identified significant non-compliances with the operator's training system and with managerial oversight prior to the accident but did not intervene and the operator was allowed to continue providing helicopter air operations.Fox Glacier helicopter crash pilot was not properly trained for his role, Melissa Nightingale, New Zealand Herald, 23 May 2019 2:03pm, retrieved 10 October 2019 Health and safety concerns At 4:30pm on Friday, 28 May 2016 the CAA suspended the Air Operating Certificate of James Patrick Scott of Alpine Adventures over operational safety concerns.

Hill's damaged body was found in Gary, Indiana on February 26, and her identity was not discovered until 2015. Taylin Hill, her adoptive mother, was charged with reckless homicide after Hill's identification, and later pleaded guilty to reduced charges for which she was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. Background Erika Hill was born in 1992, and lived with her adoptive mother, Taylin Hill (also known as \\"Minnie\\" and \\"Marie\\") in Fitchburg, Wisconsin. Taylin Hill was a cousin of Erika's biological mother, who had a history of substance abuse and relinquished custody of her daughter, and later died in 2009. Erika endured abuse from her adoptive mother, who had also abused the other children in her care, nearly on a daily basis over a period of years. Investigations of Taylin Hill's abuse allegations had previously been conducted in the years between 2000 and 2005, the last halting after authorities were unable to contact Taylin. Death After enduring a length of abuse and starvation, Erika died in February 2007. Taylin reportedly called her sister and daughter at their jobs to the home, where she showed them Erika's body in the bathroom. The next day, Taylin coerced them and the other members of the household into bringing the body into the basement and placing it in a freezer. Erika had been beaten and asphyxiated with a cloth that was later found over her mouth. Erika had also been stabbed and beaten. Some of her teeth were broken in effort to hinder identification. She also redressed the body in \\"cheap\\" clothing. The Hill family later drove the body to Chicago to dispose of it, where Taylin burned the body underneath an overpass and the family drove home, only to return and relocate the body due to Taylin's fear of an \\"elderly person having a heart attack\\" upon finding the remains and subsequently drove the body to Gary, Indiana. Many of the children in her care feared of speaking out, due to retaliation and one denied Taylin's alleged abuse. When others would inquire the whereabouts of Erika after she disappeared, Taylin reportedly claimed she had returned to her hometown of Joliet, Illinois, where she had previously been cared for by her great aunt, who died in 2001. Discovery On February 26, 2007, two men reported to police that they saw what appeared to be charred legs in the entrance of a vacant building in Gary. The victim had likely died one day before. The body had been set on fire after death had occurred and it appeared she had not been burned at the location she was found. The body was of petite stature, five feet four-to-six inches tall, and weighing 102 pounds. She was erroneously estimated to be between sixteen and twenty-five and the date of her death was inaccurately placed at twenty-four hours earlier. Over 170 distinct scars were found on the face and on several other parts of the body; these may have been inflicted at different times, as they were in different stages of healing. The hair had been pulled back into cornrows. Due to the condition of the body, the color of the eyes and clothing (except for pink underwear) could not be determined. Due to the condition of the body, visual identification was impossible. The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children created three renderings of the victim depicted in life, one around the time she was discovered and the next two, a frontal and profile image in 2014. Identification and trial Erika's remains were identified in 2015. This occurred after Taylin Hill's daughter contacted police in Gary, Indiana that she knew the identity of the unidentified victim on August 7, 2015, after she searched the internet for unidentified bodies that matched Erika's description. She recognized the reconstruction of the victim created by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children to be the closest match. She had decided to contact authorities after a therapy session and claimed she wanted to end the \\"pattern of abuse.\\" Taylin was arrested on September 14, 2015 and charged with first-degree reckless homicide, in addition to six additional charges of child abuse. Taylin Hill was reportedly on suicide watch while being held for the trial. Her bond was set at $500,000. A preliminary hearing took place on September 22. Taylin Hill had previously worked in schools as a special education aide between 1998 and 2004. She lost her position in 2006 after she did not return from a leave of absence. She returned as a substitute aide in 2013 and remained employed until she was charged with Erika's death, when the school district placed her on leave. Many members of the community were surprised after the charges were brought forward, as she was often known to be kind and never abused the children in her care in front of others. Taylin Hill's family, however, claimed they had always known \\"something was wrong\\" with Hill's character. In July 2016, Taylin Hill pleaded guilty to three reduced charges, including child neglect and abuse. On November 7, 2016, she was sentenced to 20 years in prison for causing the victim's death.

One of the perpetrators of the attack, Belgian-born French national Salah Abdeslam, was thought to be hiding in the city. As a result of warnings of a serious and imminent threat, the terror alert level was raised to the highest level (four) across the Brussels metropolitan area, and people were advised not to congregate publicly, effectively putting the city under lockdown. Impact On the first day of the lockdown, Haaretz described, \\"an atmosphere of war. Army convoys passed through the streets. Armored cars were posted at central points, outside the royal palace, and at underground railway stations.\\" Police requested a social media blackout to prevent disclosure of police operations. Twitter users responded with cat pictures (a reference to security level Four, or in French, Quatre pronounced Cat). On Monday, 23 November, the third day of the lockdown, all schools and universities remained closed along with the subway. Prime Minister Charles Michel announced that the lockdown measures would stay in place, \\"for at least another week. But schools and the metro can be reopened gradually from Wednesday.\\"H√∂chste Terrorwarnstufe in Br√ºssel verl√§ngert , zeit, 23.11.2015 The lockdown caused disruption to major institutions and organizations headquartered in the city, such as NATO, which removed all non- essential personnel on Monday, and the European Union, which opened on Monday with reinforced security measures. Belgium's biggest bank KBC Bank entirely closed its headquarters on Monday. As the lockdown continued into its third day, the BBC described the city as having \\"come to a standstill.\\" After 5 days, the lockdown was lifted on 25 November, schools reopened and the metro resumed service but some stores remained closed. Like Paris, which saw a drop in tourism, Brussels saw an immediate drop in visitors and an increase in last minute hotel cancellations. Some shops, cafes and hotels that remained open reported 90% to 100% drop in business. =Costs= The lockdown is estimated to have cost ‚Ç¨51.7 million per day, counting both the outlay on security and lost business income. Belgium is also facing a demand from the police for a budgetary increment of ‚Ç¨100 million to cover ongoing increases in costs due to the terrorism threat. The total cost was estimated at ‚Ç¨350 million, and tourist numbers in December 2015 were down 20% on the previous December. In January, in order to restore the city's reputation after the lockdown, Visit Brussels launched an initiative Call Brussels in which members of the public could call public telephones in the city via their computer. Arrests and charges Salah Abdeslam (L) and Hamza Attou (R) captured on CCTV at a French petrol station hours after the attacks. A reported 1,000 police officers were involved in the search for Salah Abdeslam. Over the weekend police conducted at least 20 raids around the city and nearby areas, making 16 arrests but releasing 15 of these people. Belgium's federal prosecutor's office said 23 November that a man had been charged with involvement in the Paris terrorist attacks and for membership of a terrorist organization. On Monday 21 more arrests were made, with 17 released. On Tuesday, evening prosecutors announced terrorism charges had been filed against four men: *Hamza Attou and Mohammed Amri. Lawyers for these two men said they had admitted driving Salah Abdeslam from Paris to Brussels after the Paris attacks but said they had nothing to do with the attacks. *\\"Ali O.\\", a 31-year-old French national who lived in Molenbeek neighborhood of Brussels. *\\"Lazez A.\\", a 39-year-old Moroccan also from Molenbeek arrested on 19 November. Two pistols and traces of blood were found in his car. Aftermath King Philippe of Belgium addressed the Brussels lockdown and Paris attack in his annual Christmas Address. He said during his speech, \\"My special thanks go to all those who have fought for it and continue to work to ensure our safety, to identify the perpetrators of these attacks and to prevent new ones. These events have shown how important it is to invest in the judiciary, police, army and intelligence services. I also want to thank you all, and especially the people of Brussels, for your dignified and responsible behavior during this difficult time.\\" Precedents Extended lockdowns of entire urban areas have been rare; the European Union called the Brussels lockdown \\"unprecedented\\". The extent of the lockdown went well beyond measures taken the last time Belgium declared a level four alert in 2007. One previous example of a citywide lockdown was the one-day lockdown of Boston in April 2013 as police hunted for the Islamist terrorists responsible for the Boston Marathon bombing. Another example for a different reason, namely due to a swine flu outbreak, was the lockdown of Mexico City in April 2009.

Iran-Russia relations were strengthened by the signing of seven memorandum of understandings.

He further pointed to Algeria and North African states' capacities to boost economic and political cooperation with Iran and hoped that the formation of the Iran-Algeria Joint Economic Commission would improve mutual cooperation. Sellal added that called for cooperation in fighting groups such as ISIL. In particular, he said Iran can play an effective role in restoring security to the region. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif met his Nigerian counterpart, Geoffrey Onyeama, and warned of the dangers posed by groups such as Boko Haram, Daesh and al-Shabaab. \\"Ever- growing threats of extremism in the world are rooted in false beliefs of Takfiri groups and lack of genuine attention to financial and ideological sources nurturing these groups.\\" He further called on Muslim and African countries to reinforce their solidarity and cooperation to battle such groups. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin before the summit Rouhani met Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro called for boosting Iran-Venezuela relations and oil producer countries need to enhance their cooperation to improve the oil market. \\"Iran and Venezuela share close viewpoints on political issues and regional developments;\\" he cited their opposition to the violation of the rights of Palestinians and the fight against non-state militant activity as well as the in Iraq and Syria and the restoration of security.

Khamenei met Iraqi President Fuad Masum and called for unity against rhetoric calling for its partition. \\"The people of Iraq, including Shias, Sunnis, Kurds and Arabs, have been co-existing without a problem for centuries; but, unfortunately, certain regional countries as well as foreigners seek to exaggerate disagreements.\\" He noted that such comments to the contrary allowed for meddling by outsiders. \\"Why should such a country as Iraq ‚Äì a large, prosperous country with a thousand-year history ‚Äì be disintegrated and divided into smaller parts, and thereby always be exposed to disagreement and confrontation?\\" He also said the youth had undergone an awakening and are now aware of their capabilities, in particular the Popular Mobilisation Forces in Iraq were a manifestation of such an awakening. In turn, Masum heeded the advice, especially at a time of the ISIL insurgency.http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2015/11/24/438930/Leader-Ayatollah- Khamenei-Iraqi-President-Masum References 2015 conferences 2015 in international relations 2015 in Iran 21st- century diplomatic conferences Diplomatic conferences in Iran Gas Exporting Countries Forum ","title":"Third GECF summit"},{"id":"48619366","text":"Vladimir Sokhatsky (born December 29, 1989) is a Russian professional ice hockey goaltender who is currently playing for Saryarka Karaganda in the Supreme Hockey League (VHL).

History K9s For Warriors was founded in 2011 by Shari Duval who was inspired by her son, Brett Simon, a contractor who returned from two tours in Iraq and was suffering from severe post-traumatic stress. Program K9s For Warriors evaluates and trains rescued dogs before providing them to veterans as service dogs for no charge. The organization accommodates veterans during a three-week live-in program to facilitate bonding with a trained dog, following which the veterans are sent home along with their service dog. As of January 2019, K9s For warriors has graduated 500 warrior-canine teams https://www.k9sforwarriors.org/sites/default/files/500%20grads%20Press%20Release%20.pdf.The organization claims that 95% of dogs used in the program are rescues, with the other 5% coming from breeders or being surrendered by owners . In 2018, the organization opened its second training facility near Gainesville, FL, named the Gold Family Campus. https://www.wuft.org/news/2018/02/01/gold-family- campus-offering-second-chances-for-veterans-rescue-dogs/ Media coverage There are many success stories of K9s For Warriors program beneficiaries.

Scientific Studies  In 2015, K9s For Warriors entered into a partnership with Purdue University. The goal was to verify scientifically that service dogs are an effective treatment for veterans with PTSD. The study is the first published research to define the biobehavioral effects of service dogs on veterans with PTSD. This study was able to show that those with PTSD have less anger, less anxiety and better sleep. Currently, a large-scale clinical trial is underway at the National Institutes of Health to further study the efficacy of service dogs for veterans with PTSD. The length of the trial allows for a better understanding of the interrelationships between psychological and behavioral processes, PTSD symptoms and service dogs.
