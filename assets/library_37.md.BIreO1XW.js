It is present in many collections of folk tales including Best-Loved Folktales of the World (1982). It was one of many Norse folk tales included in Norske Folkeeventyr by Peter Christen Asbj√∏rnsen and J√∏rgen Engebretsen Moe between about 1853 and 1858. Hans Christian Andersen's \\"What the Old Man does is always Right\\" (in Nye Eventyr og Historier, 1861) is another adaptation of this tale. Themes of optimism, looking on the bright side, and marital happiness are attributed to this tale. Summary The story is about Gudbrand and his wife, who live on a hillside and get along very well. They own two cows and decide to bring one to town to sell. When Gudbrand arrives in town, he is unable to sell his cow but since he is just as well off as before, he heads back home. On his way home, he runs into a man who has a horse, and he trades the cow for the horse. Next, he meets a man with a pig, and trades the horse for the pig. Then he comes to a man with a goat, and trades the pig for the goat. He trades his goat with a man who has a sheep. After the sheep, he trades with another for a goose. Then in the same manner he acquires a rooster. He then realizes he is famished and needs food, so he sells his rooster to buy some food, leaving him to go home empty-handed. He stops at his neighbor's place to rest for the night, and he tells the neighbor his story. The neighbor tells him he would hate to be in his shoes, because his wife would be very upset with him if he came home with nothing. Gudbrand tells his neighbor that he and his wife get along fine, and she will understand and agree with his decisions. He places a bet with his neighbor for one hundred thalers that he has at home. The bet is that Gudbrand's wife will not be displeased with his decisions and his neighbor accepts. The next day Gudbrand and his neighbor head off to his home where the neighbor hides behind the door while Gudbrand greets his wife and explains to her the details of his travels. As he tells her of his trades, she finds a positive side to all of his decisions, and as he tells her about selling the rooster because he needed food to get home, she exclaims, \\"Now God be praised that you did so! Whatever you do, you do it always just after my own heart. Heaven be thanked that I have got you safe back again; you who do everything so well that I want neither rooster nor goose; neither pigs nor kine.\\" Gudbrand wins the bet with his neighbor. In the Andersen version, called \\"What the Old Man does is always Right\\" (sometimes translated \\"What Father does is always Right\\"), the essential story is the same though some of the components are different. Instead of a cow, the man begins with a horse; instead of ending with nothing, he ends with a bag of rotten apples; and instead of a neighbor, his wager is with two traveling Englishmen. Characters *Gudbrand: A good husband who makes impulsive decisions but has a positive attitude about everything life sends his way. *Gudbrand's wife: Optimistic and supportive of her husband's decisions; she finds the good in every event. *Neighbor: He represents how most people would react to Gudbrand's impulsive nature and how most other people's wives would respond. Themes and analysis In the Aarne-Thompson tale type index, \\"Gudbrand on the Hillside\\" is classified under 1415, Trading Away One's Fortune. The benefit of a happy and trusting marriage is one theme. George Webbe Dasent, emphasizing the tale's simplicity, notes that \\"The happiness of married life was never more prettily told\\" than in this story, \\"where the tenderness of the wife for her husband weighs down all other considerations\\". Another theme along these lines is the importance to personal happiness of seeing the good in what you have. The tale has been used in discussions of cognitive dissonance to exemplify a dissonance-increasing behavior (repeated poor trades) that leads to dissonance reduction behavior (believing that the trades were well-made). In 1939, Johannes V. Jensen reinterpreted the story by inverting it: the man begins with a bag of rotten apples and ends with a horse, and his wife is dissatisfied with every trade he made (compare this to the Japanese legend of the Straw Millionaire).

The group differs from other potato cultivar-groups by the absence of dormant tubers. This means that the tuber immediately begins to grow once it is formed, without a resting period. This explains why the varieties of the group are to be planted in areas with a mild climate, where culture throughout the year is possible. By hybridization with Solanum tuberosum by the Scottish Crop Research Institute, varieties were obtained who are adapted to the European climate. These crossings are particularly popular as a culinary potato for their excellent taste. \\"Cultivar-groups\\" are taxonomic categories used by the International Code of Nomenclature of Cultivated Plants (ICNCP) to associate of cultivars (cultivated varieties) of plants with traits useful to farmers. The criteria used to distinguish potato cultivar-groups include non-morphological traits such as frost tolerance, tuber dormancy, daylength adaptation, and ploidy level. Description Plants of the Phureja Group are ascending to erect, with pedicel articulation is evident below the upper 20% of the pedicel, and upper leaves diverge from stems at 40¬∞-50¬∞. They are adapted to short-day flowering and tuberization, and are generally not frost tolerant. They are diploid, and differentiated from the Stenotomum Group in that the tubers sprout at harvest in the Phureja Group. Taxonomy Solanum phureja was originally described as a species in 1929 by Russian botanists Sergei Vasilievic Juzepczuk and Sergej (Sergei) Mikhailovich Bukasov. Bukasov had totally revised the systematic botany of potatoes in 1923. While the 20th century saw significant controversy over the species status of S. andigenum and S. tuberosum, and which gave rise to modern potato cultivars, different classifications until 2002 typically agreed with treating S. phureja as a separate species. An exception was K. S. Dodds and G. J. Paxman, who in 1962 suggested it be included as one of five cultivar-groups of S. tuberosum, Group Phureja, based this on a number of factors, particularly poor morphological separation of cultivated diploid species. There were also published descriptions and proposals of several subspecies, varieties, and forms of S. phureja have been that were published. A 2002 reclassification by Huaman and Spooner found little phenetic support for the then-mainstream treatment of S. phureja as a species. They reclassified all cultivated potatoes as a single species, S. tuberosum, divided into eight cultivar-groups, including a Phreja Group. At that time, the mainstream, but not universally accepted, classification had been from Hawkes 1990, which recognized three subspecies of S. phureja: S. phureja Juz. and Bukasov subsp. phureja, S. phureja subsp. estradae (L√≥pez) Hawkes, and S. phureja subsp. hygrothermicum (Ochoa) Hawkes. A 2011 summary of the issue said that the species of Hawkes 1990 should be treated as groups arising under domestication was by then generally accepted.  References  *‚Üë Plaisted, R.

Fossils have been found from the Santa Maria Supersequence of the late Carnian and early Norian stages, making Aetobarbakinoides one of the oldest aetosaurs. The type species, A. brasiliensis, was named in 2012, and is notable for being described primarily by features of the vertebrae; most other aetosaurs are diagnosed by features in bony plates called osteoderms, which are by far the most common material. Although placed in a basal phylogenetic position among aetosaurs, Aetobarbakinoides is closely related to both desmatosuchines and typothoracisines, two derived clades of aetosaurs. Discovery Aetobarbakinoides is known only from the holotype specimen CPE2 168, a partially articulated partial postcranial skeleton which is housed at the Cole√ß√£o Municipal in S√£o Pedro do Sul. It was found near the city of S√£o Pedro do Sul, in the center of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. It was collected in the Inhamand√° locality, from the Hyperodapedon Assemblage Zone, Sequence 2 of the Santa Maria Supersequence (formerly known as Santa Maria Formation) which dates back to the late Carnian and earliest Norian stages of the Late Triassic. CPE2 168 was assigned by Lucas & Heckert (2001) to Stagonolepis robertsoni. It is the first aetosaur to be diagnosed in its original description without osteoderms, the most common material associated with these reptiles. Along with the genus Aetosauroides from Argentina and Brazil and Stagonolepis robertsoni from Scotland, Aetobarbakinoides is among the oldest aetosaurs. Its presence in South America indicates that aetosaurs had a wide geographic distribution early in their history. Aetobarbakinoides is most closely related to Aetosauroides and Neoaetosauroides. Features of its osteoderms suggest a close relationship with aetosaurines, but its vertebrae are more similar to desmatosuchines. Description Aetobarbakinoides is known from neck and back vertebrae, ribs, and several limb bones including the scapula, humerus, tibia, and foot bones. Paramedian osteoderms overlying the midline of the back and neck are also known. Most of the distinguishing features of Aetobarbakinoides are found in its vertebrae. Laterally-oriented projections on the neck vertebrae called prezygapophyses are longer and wider than those of many other aetosaurs. In contrast, the prezygapophyses of the vertebrae at the base of the tail are very thin. The humerus and tibia are large relative to the axial skeleton. The vertebrae of Aetobarbakinoides are more similar to those of Desmatosuchus than they are to its closest relatives, Aetosauroides and Neoaetosaurioides. Aetobarbakinoides is a medium-sized aetosaur, it has been estimated to have been about in total length. Classification A phylogenetic analysis was conducted in the first description of Aetobarbakinoides. Close relatives included Aetosauroides and Neoaetosauroides, both of which are from South America. Aetobarbakinoides was found to be most closely related to a clade including Desmatosuchinae and Typothoracisinae. In most studies, Typothoracisinae is placed in the subfamily Aetosaurinae, while Desmatosuchinae makes up its own subfamily of aetosaurs. This study suggests that Aetosaurinae is paraphyletic, and that aetosaurines represent a grade of early aetosaurs that developed into desmatosuchines and typothoracisines later in the Triassic. The following cladogram simplified after an analysis presented by Julia B. Desojo, Martin D. Ezcurra and Edio E. Kischlat (2012). Etymology Aetobarbakinoides was first named by Julia B. Desojo, Martin D. Ezcurra and Edio E. Kischlat in 2012 and the type species is Aetobarbakinoides brasiliensis. The generic name is derived from Greek aetobarbakina meaning \\"long-legged buzzard\\" (the common name of Buteo rufinus) and from Latin oides meaning \\"form\\". It refers to its elongated humerus and tibia and the close relation to the \\"eagle reptile\\", Aetosaurus. The specific name refers to Brazil, the country in which the holotype was found.

The title is Latin for \\"Light after darkness\\". The film is semiautobiographical, and the narrative follows a rural couple in Mexico, with additional scenes from England, Spain and Belgium; all places where Reygadas has lived. The film competed at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival and Reygadas won the Best Director Award. Contemporary reviews for Post Tenebras Lux were far more divided than those for Reygadas' previous works. Some considered the film to be incoherent or frustrating in structure, while others have declared it a masterpiece. Plot The film deals with a peculiar narrative, the life of Juan (Adolfo Jimenez Castro), a wealthy householder who, with his wife Natalia (Nathalia Acevedo) and their two young children Eleazar (Eleazar Reygadas) and Rut (Ruth Reygadas), decide to change the life of the city for the plain and simple country life. Starting again with an ostentatious house (in comparison to the homes of the few neighbors), they initially enjoy the taste of rural life. However this change in taste begins to make the marriage crumble. The children, on the other hand, are not encumbered by previous ideas and enjoy the life offered by this bleak place. The character of Juan begins to have contact with people who have the same ideals. Seven (Willebaldo Torres), a man who usually does everything in his power to survive leads him to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in a ramshackle cabin in the woods. The film takes us into the hands of the most intimate problems that each of the people face, not to feed a superficial argument, but each character is involved in the problems affecting daily life of a rural culture where the world is cruel and life is harder. Production Carlos Reygadas began to develop the idea for the film when he was building his house in the state of Morelos, Mexico. Reygadas would take frequent walks around the mountains and wanted to turn those experiences into a film. He envisioned it as a work where \\"reason will intervene as little as possible, like an expressionist painting where you try to express what you're feeling through the painting rather than depict what something looks like\\". Many story elements are directly autobiographical, although the director has stressed that the film is partially about desire and fantasies, so everything has not taken place in reality. The rugby sequence was inspired by the director's time as a student in England, where he enjoyed the sport. The rugby scene was filmed at the director's Alma Mater, Mount St Mary's College. The film was produced by Jaime Romand√≠a and Carlos Reygadas through their companies Mantarraya Producciones and NoDreamsCinema. It was co-produced by France's Le Pacte and Dutch Topkapi Films. It was also backed by Arte France Cin√©ma. The film was made in the 4:3 (1.37:1) aspect ratio because of the landscape with steep mountains, and to achieve compositions with a clearly framed centre. Exterior scenes were shot with a distortion effect around the edges; this was inspired by the impressionists and their fascination with outdoors motifs, as well as by the view from an old, not entirely smooth glass window. The village in the film is where Reygadas lives in Morelos. Filming wrapped late in 2011. Release The film premiered in competition at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival on 24 May. The New York Times reported of \\"belligerent boos and hooting\\" at the screening. All three of Reygadas' previous feature films had premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. It went on to screen within such festivals as Toronto International Film Festival and Maryland Film Festival, and was acquired for U.S. distribution by Strand Releasing. Critical response As of July 2014, the film had a rotten rating of 55% on the website Rotten Tomatoes out of 51 reviews. On Metacritic, the film has a 69/100 rating, based on 20 reviews, signifying \\"generally favorable reviews\\". The movie was released to mixed critical reviews. Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times described it as \\"real rarity in cinema, a visually striking archaeology of the psyche that benefits both the moviegoer primed to engage Reygadas' ideas, and the ones open to being swallowed in an art film wave\\". In a largely positive review, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote, \\"Everything in the film may be in the past or may just be in the eternal, magnificent, maddening present that is Mr. Reygadas‚Äôs consciousness.\\" Neil Young of The Hollywood Reporter labeled the film as \\"offensively self- indulgent cubist folly\\". Young expressed admiration for Reygadas' previous film Silent Light, but wrote: \\"Suspicions that the lauded, award-laden Mexican is, in artistic terms, an emperor clad in exquisitely invisible garments will only crystallize further thanks to Post Tenebras Lux‚Äîwhich at its worst exudes the sort of smug pretentiousness that gives art-cinema a bad name in many quarters.\\" In Screen International, Jonathan Romney wrote: \\"Alexis Zab√©'s vividly beautiful photography variously makes the images seem spontaneously caught, or deliberately framed and fixed in a video art manner‚Äîand it could be argued that this film has much more in common with gallery video than with most contemporary theatrical art cinema... However, you never feel that Reygadas is out to impose his unorthodox outlook, to impress himself on you as a visionary. There is a vision here, certainly, but the film feels genuinely, bracingly experimental in that it seems to be searching for its own meaning and form, rather than asserting them ready-made.\\" Cast * Adolfo Jim√©nez Castro as Juan * Nathalia Acevedo as Nathalia * Willebaldo Torres as \\"Seven\\" * Rut Reygadas as Rut * Eleazar Reygadas as Eleazar Awards *Cannes Film Festival, Best Director *Cinemanila International Film Festival, Best Director *Lima Latin American Film Festival, Critics Award (Best Director) *Lima Latin American Film Festival, APRECI Prize (Best Film) *Mar del Plata International Film Festival, Special Mention for Carlos Reygadas See also * 2012 in film * Cinema of Mexico References External links  Category:Dutch films Category:Films directed by Carlos Reygadas Category:Films set in Mexico Category:French films Category:Mexican films Category:2012 films ","title":"Post Tenebras Lux (film)"},{"id":"34424860","text":"Vanayi-ye Sofla (, also Romanized as VanƒÅyƒ´-ye Sofl√°; also known as VanƒÅbƒ´-ye Sofl√°) is a village in Koregah-e Sharqi Rural District, in the Central District of Khorramabad County, Lorestan Province, Iran.

History Vo Canh Stele at National Museum of Vietnamese History, is the oldest Sanskrit inscription ever found in Southeast Asia One theory holds that the people of Champa were descended from settlers who reached the Southeast Asian mainland from Borneo about the time of the Sa Hu·ª≥nh culture, though genetic evidence points to exchanges with India. Sa Hu·ª≥nh sites are rich in iron artifacts, by contrast with the ƒê√¥ng S∆°n culture sites found in northern Vietnam and elsewhere in mainland Southeast Asia, where bronze artifacts are dominant. The Cham language is part of the Austronesian family. According to one study, Cham is related most closely to modern Acehnese. Founding legend Cham tradition says that the founder of the Cham state was Lady Po Nagar. She hailed from Kh√°nh H√≤a Province, in a peasant family in the mountains of Dai An. Spirits assisted her when she drifted on a piece of sandalwood to China, where she married a Chinese crown prince, the son of the Emperor of China, with whom she had two children. She then became Queen of Champa. When she returned to Champa to visit her family, the Prince refused to let her go, but she flung the sandalwood into the ocean, disappeared with her children and reappeared at Nha Trang to her family. When the Chinese prince tried to follow her back to Nha Trang, she was furious and turned him and his fleet into stone. The Sa Hu·ª≥nh culture The Sa Hu·ª≥nh culture was a late prehistoric metal age society on the central coast of Viet Nam. In 1909, urns containing cremated remains and grave goods were discovered at Thanh Duc, near Sa Hu·ª≥nh, a coastal village located south of Da Nang. Since then, many more burials have been found, from Hu·∫ø to the ƒê·ªìng Nai river delta. The jar burials contain bronze mirrors, coins, bells, bracelets, axes and spearheads, iron spearheads, knives and sickles, and beads made of gold, glass, carnelian, agate and nephrite. Radiocarbon dating of the Sa Hu·ª≥nh culture remains range from 400 BC to the first or second century AD. The Sa Hu·ª≥nh exchanged items along maritime trade routes with Taiwan and the Philippines. \\"At present, the consensus of all evidence points to a relatively late intrusive settlement of this region by sea from Borneo, a move which stimulated the rise of Sa Hu·ª≥nh, and then the development of the Cham states.\\" Higham, C., 2014, Early Mainland Southeast Asia, Bangkok: River Books Co., Ltd., L√¢m ·∫§p To the Chinese, the country of Champa was known as ÊûóÈÇë Linyi in Mandarin and Lam Yap in Cantonese and to the Vietnamese, L√¢m ·∫§p (which is the Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation of ÊûóÈÇë). It had been founded in 192 AD in the region of modern Hu·∫ø by Khu Li√™n, a local leader rebelling against the Han dynasty. Over the next several centuries, Han forces made repeated unsuccessful attempts to retake the region.L√™ Th√†nh Kh√¥i, Histoire du Vietnam, p.103. From its neighbor Funan to the west, L√¢m ·∫§p soon came under the influence of Indian civilization.L√™ Th√†nh Kh√¥i, Histoire du Vietnam, p.105. Scholars locate the historical beginnings of Champa in the 4th century, when the process of Indianization was well underway. It was in this period that the Cham people began to create stone inscriptions in both Sanskrit and in their own language, for which they created a unique script.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, M·ªπ S∆°n Relics, p.181.

In style, they exhibit the influence of pre- Angkorian Cambodia. The Book of Jin has some records about Lam Ap during the 3rd to 5th centuries. Fan Wen (ËåÉÊñá) became the king in 336. He attacked and annexed Daqijie, Xiaoqijie, Ship, Xulang, Qudu, Ganlu, and Fudan. Fan Wen sent a message and paid tribute to the Chinese Emperor, and the message was \\"written in barbarian characters\\". Lam Ap sometimes maintained the tributary status and sometimes was hostile to the Jin dynasty, and the Commandery of Rinan (Êó•Âçó, Chinese:Rinan, Vietnamese:Nh·∫≠t Nam) was frequently under attack from Lam Ap. The first king acknowledged in the inscriptions is Bhadravarman, who reigned from 380 to 413. At M·ªπ S∆°n, King Bhadravarman established a linga called Bhadresvara, whose name was a combination of the king's own name and that of the Hindu god of gods Shiva.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, Champa, p.31. The worship of the original god-king under the name Bhadresvara and other names continued through the centuries that followed.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, Champa, p.38-39; Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, M·ªπ S∆°n Relics, p.55ff. The capital of L√¢m ·∫§p at the time of Bhadravarman was the citadel of Simhapura (\\"Lion City\\", not to be confused with Singapore, which shares similar pronunciation and etymology), located along two rivers and had a wall eight miles in circumference. A Chinese writer described the people of L√¢m ·∫§p as both warlike and musical, with \\"deep eyes, a high straight nose, and curly black hair.\\"Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, M·ªπ S∆°n Relics, p.56ff. According to Chinese records, Sambhuvarman (Fan Fan Tche) was crowned king of L√¢m ·∫§p in 529. Inscriptions credit him with rehabilitating the temple to Bhadresvara after a fire. Sambhuvarman also sent delegations and tribute to China and unsuccessfully invaded what is now northern Vietnam.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, M·ªπ S∆°n Relics, p.60ff. George C≈ìd√®s states that this was actually Rudravarman, followed by his son Sambhuvarman; their combined reigns extended from 529 to 629. When the Vietnamese gained a brief independence under the Early L√Ω dynasty (544-602), King L√Ω Nam ƒê·∫ø sent his general, Pham Tu, to pacify the Chams after they raided southern border, in 543; the Chams were defeated. In 605, a general Liu Fang (ÂäâÊñπ) of the Chinese Sui dynasty invaded L√¢m ·∫§p, won a battle by luring the enemy war-elephants into an area booby-trapped with camouflaged pits, massacred the defeated troops, and captured the capital.Ng√¥ V√£n Doanh, M·ªπ S∆°n Relics, p.62ff.; L√™ Th√†nh Kh√¥i, Histoire du Vietnam, p.107-108. Sambhuvarman rebuilt the capital and the Bhadravarman temple at M·ªπ S∆°n, then received Chenla King Mahendravarman's ambassador. In the 620s, the kings of L√¢m ·∫§p sent delegations to the court of the recently established Tang dynasty and asked to become vassals of the Chinese court.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, M·ªπ S∆°n Relics, p.63.

Thereafter for a time, the Chinese referred to Champa as \\"Hoan Vuong\\" or \\"Huanwang\\".Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, M·ªπ S∆°n Relics, p.66. The earliest Chinese records using a name related to \\"Champa\\" are dated 877; however, such names had been in use by the Cham themselves since at least 629, and by the Khmer since at least 657.Jean Boisselier, La statuaire du Champa, p.87. Champa at its peak Asia in 800 AD, showing the Champa city-states and their neighbors From the 7th to the 10th centuries, the Cham controlled the trade in spices and silk between China, India, the Indonesian islands, and the Abbasid empire in Baghdad. They supplemented their income from the trade routes not only by exporting ivory and aloe, but also by engaging in piracy and raiding.L√™ Th√†nh Kh√¥i, Histoire du Vietnam, p.109. Religious foundations at M·ªπ S∆°n By the second half of the 7th century, royal temples were beginning to appear at M·ªπ S∆°n. The dominant religious cult was that of the Hindu god Shiva, but temples were also dedicated to Vishnu. Scholars have called the architectural style of this period M·ªπ S∆°n E1, in reference to a particular edifice at M·ªπ S∆°n that is regarded as emblematic of the style. Important surviving works of art in this style include a pedestal for a linga that has come to be known as the M·ªπ S∆°n E1 Pedestal and a pediment depicting the birth of Brahma from a lotus issuing from the navel of the sleeping Vishnu.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, Champa, p.49. Stone pedestal of a temple with an Apsara dancer and a Gandharva musician (Tr√† Ki·ªáu style) In an important stone inscription dated 657, found at M·ªπ S∆°n, King Prakasadharma, who took on the name Vikrantavarman I at his coronation, claimed to be descended through his mother from the Brahman Kaundinya and the serpent princess Soma, the legendary ancestors of the Khmer of Cambodia. This inscription underlines the ethnic and cultural connection of Champa with the Khmer Empire, its perennial rival to the west. It also commemorates the king's dedication of a monument, probably a linga, to Shiva.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, M·ªπ S∆°n Relics, p.66 ff.; p.183 ff. An English translation of the inscription is at pp.197ff. Another inscription documents the king's almost mystical devotion to Shiva, \\"who is the source of the supreme end of life, difficult to attain; whose true nature is beyond the domain of thought and speech, yet whose image, identical with the universe, is manifested by his forms.\\"Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, M·ªπ S∆°n Relics, p.210. Temporary preeminence of Kauthara In the 8th century, during the time when the Chinese knew the country as \\"Huanwang\\", the political center of Champa shifted temporarily from M·ªπ S∆°n southward to the regions of Panduranga and Kauthara, centered around the temple complex of Po Nagar near modern Nha Trang that was dedicated to the indigenous Earth goddess Yan Po Nagar. In 774, raiders from Java disembarked in Kauthara, burned the temple of Po Nagar, and carried off the image of Shiva. The Cham king Satyavarman pursued the raiders and defeated them in a naval battle. In 781, Satyavarman erected a stele at Po Nagar, declaring that he had regained control of the area and had restored the temple. In 787, Javanese raiders destroyed a temple dedicated to Shiva near Panduranga.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, M·ªπ S∆°n Relics, p.72. Javanese raids Srivijaya attacks on Champa and Jiaozhi In 767, Tonkin coast was hit by Java (Daba) and Kunlun raids, around modern day Hanoi the capital of Tonkin (Annam). Around Son-tay they were vanquished at the hands of Chang Po-i the governor, after the Kunlun and Java (Shepo) assaulted Tongking in 767. Champa was subsequently assaulted by Javanese or Kunlun vessels in 774 and 787. In 774 an assault was launched on Po-Nagar in Nha-trang where the pirates demolished temples, while in 787 an assault was launched on Phang- rang. Several Champa coastal cities suffered naval raids and assault from Java. Java armadas was called as Javabala-sanghair-nƒÅvƒÅgatai·∏• (Java armadas) which are recorded in Champa epigraphs. All of these raids believed was launched by the Sailendras, ruler of Java and Srivijaya. The possible cause of Srivijaya Sailendras assault on Champa was probably prompted by commerce rivalry on serving Chinese market. The 787 epigraph was in Yang Tikuh while the 774 epigraph was Po-nagar. In Kauthara province in 774, Champa's Siva- linga temple of Po Nagar was assaulted and demolished. Champa source mentioned their invader as foreigners, sea-farers, eaters of inferior food, of frightful appearance, extraordinarily black and thin. The 774 assault by the Javanese happened in the rule of Isvaraloka (Satyavarman). Cham record mentioned that their country was hit by ferocious, pitiless, dark-skinned sea raiders, which modern historians believed to by Javanese. Java had commercial and cultural links to Champa. And assault was initiated on Cambodia. Javanese raid was launched via the Pulo Condor island. Malaya, Sumatra or Java all could have been the origin of the assaulters. The Kauthara Nha Trang temple of Po Nagar was ruined when ferocious, pitiless, dark-skinned men born in other countries, whose food was more horrible than corpses, and who were vicious and furious, came in ships . . . took away the [temple linga], and set fire to the temple. In 774 according to the Nha Trang epigraph in Sanskrit by the Chams. Men born in other lands, living on other foods, frightful to look at, unnaturally dark and lean, cruel as death, passing over the sea in ships assaulted in 774. In 787, warriors from Java borne over in ships assaulted Champa. In Phan-rang the Sri Bhadradhipatlsvara temple was arsoned by seaborne Java troops in 787, when Indravarman was in power at the hands of the Javanese. It was mentioned the armies of Java, having come in vessels of the 787 assault, and of the previous assault, that Satyavarman, the King of Champa vanquished them as they were followed by good ships and beaten at sea and they were men living on food more horrible than cadavers, frightful, completely black and gaunt, dreadful and evil as death, came in ships in the Nha-trang Po Nagar epigraph in Sanskrit, which called hem men born in other countries. The ruin of the temple at Panduranga in 787 came at the hands of the assaulters. Champa was an important commerce link between China and Srivijaya. The Majapahit and their predecessors the Javanese Mataram had ties with Champa. The Buddhist dynasty at Indrapura In 875, King Indravarman II founded a new northern dynasty at Indrapura (Dong Duong near Da Nang in modern Vietnam). Eager to claim an ancient lineage, Indravarman declared himself the descendant of Bhrigu, the venerable sage whose exploits are detailed in the Mahabharata, and asserted that Indrapura had been founded by the same Bhrigu in ancient times.Jean Boisselier, La statuaire du Champa, p.90f. From 877 onward, the Chinese knew Champa as \\"Cheng-cheng\\", discontinuing their use of the term \\"Huan-wang.\\"Maspero, G., 2002, The Champa Kingdom, Bangkok: White Lotus Co., Ltd., Indravarman II repulsed an invasion by the Khmer King Yasovarman I. 13th century sculpture in the Thap Mam style, depicting Garuda devouring a serpent Indravarman was the first Cham monarch to adopt Mahayana Buddhism as an official religion. At the center of Indrapura, he constructed a Buddhist monastery (vihara) dedicated to the bodhisattva Lokesvara. The foundation, regrettably, was devastated during the Vietnam War. Thankfully, some photographs and sketches survive from the prewar period. In addition, some stone sculptures from the monastery are preserved in Vietnamese museums. Scholars have called the artistic style typical of the Indrapura the Dong Duong Style. The style is characterized by its dynamism and ethnic realism in the depiction of the Cham people. Surviving masterpieces of the style include several tall sculptures of fierce dvarapalas or temple guardians that were once positioned around the monastery. The period in which Buddhism reigned as the principal religion of Champa came to an end in approximately 925, at which time the Dong Duong Style also began to give way to subsequent artistic styles linked with the restoration of Shaivism as the national religion.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, M·ªπ S∆°n Relics, p.72ff., p.184. Kings belonging to the dynasty of Indrapura built a number of temples at M·ªπ S∆°n in the 9th and 10th centuries. Their temples at M·ªπ S∆°n came to define a new architectural and artistic style, called by scholars the M·ªπ S∆°n A1 Style, again in reference to a particular foundation at M·ªπ S∆°n regarded emblematic for the style. With the religious shift from Buddhism back to Shaivism around the beginning of the 10th century, the center of Cham religion also shifted from Dong Duong back to M·ªπ S∆°n.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, Champa, p.32; Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, M·ªπ S∆°n Relics, p.71ff. Attrition through conflict with ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát and the Khmer Interesting parallels may be observed between the history of northern Champa (Indrapura and Vijaya) and that of its neighbor and rival to the west, the Khmer civilization of Angkor, located just to the north of the great lake Tonl√© Sap in what is now Cambodia. The foundation of the Cham dynasty at Indrapura in 875 was followed by the foundation of the Khmer empire at Roluos in 877 by King Indravarman I, who united two previously independent regions of Cambodia. The parallels continued as the two peoples flourished from the 10th through 12th centuries, then went into gradual decline, suffering their ultimate defeat in the 15th century. In 982, King L√™ Ho√†n of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát sent army invaded Champa, sacked Indrapura and beheaded Champa king. The new Champa king agreed to pay tributes to Vietnamese court every year until 1064. In 1238, the Khmer lost control of their western possessions around Sukhothai as the result of a Thai revolt. The successful revolt not only ushered in the era of Thai independence but also foreshadowed the eventual abandonment of Angkor in 1431, following its sack by Thai invaders from the kingdom of Ayutthaya, which had absorbed Sukhothai in 1376. The decline of Champa was roughly contemporaneous with that of Angkor and was precipitated by pressure from ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát of what is now northern Vietnam, culminating in the conquest and obliteration of Vijaya in 1471. Trade According to the Daoyi Zhilue documents, around the 11th century Chinese merchants who went to Cham ports in Champa married Cham women, to whom they regularly returned after trading voyages. A Chinese merchant from Quanzhou, Wang Yuanmao, traded extensively with Champa and married a Cham princess. Khmer invasions of Kauthara In 944 and 945, Khmer troops from Cambodia invaded the region of Kauthara.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, M·ªπ S∆°n Relics, p.73. Around 950, the Khmer under Rajendravarman II pillaged the temple of Po Nagar and carried off the statue of the goddess. In 960, the Cham King Jaya Indravaman I sent a delegation with tribute to the first king of the Chinese Song dynasty, which had been established in Kaifeng around 960. In 965, the king restored the temple at Po Nagar and reconstructed the statue of the goddess to replace the one stolen by the Khmer.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, M·ªπ S∆°n Relics, p.75. War with ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát and the abandonment of Indrapura In the latter half of the 10th century, the kings of Indrapura waged war against the Vietnamese. The Viet had spent the better part of the century securing and consolidating their independence from the Chinese. Following the defeat of the Chinese fleet by king Ng√¥ Quy·ªÅn in the Battle of B·∫°ch ƒê·∫±ng in 938, the country had gone through a period of internal turmoil until its final reunification by king Dinh Bo Linh in 968 under the name ƒê·∫°i C·ªì Vi·ªát kingdom, and the establishment of a capital at Hoa L∆∞ near modern Ninh B√¨nh.L√™ Th√†nh Kh√¥i, Histoire du Vietnam, p.122, 141. Closeup of the inscription in Cham script on the Po Nagar stele, 965 CE. The stele describes feats by the Champa kings. In 979, the Cham King Parameshvaravarman I (Ph√™ Mi Thu√™ to the Viet) sent a fleet to attack Hoa L∆∞ in support of dissatisfied prince Ng√¥ Nh·∫≠t Kh√°nh following the Vietnamese civil war of twelve warlords. However, the ill-fated expedition was scuttled by a typhoon. In 982, King L√™ Ho√†n of ƒê·∫°i C·ªì Vi·ªát sent an ambassador to Indrapura. When the ambassador was detained, L√™ Ho√†n decided to attack the Cham capital. Viet troops sacked Indrapura and killed Parameshvararman I. They carried off women from the king's entourage, gold, silver, and other precious objects. As a result of these setbacks, the Cham abandoned Indrapura around 1000. From 986 to 989, L∆∞u K·ª≥ T√¥ng (or Liu Ke-Tsong in Chinese record), a Vietnamese merchant in Indrapura, alleged took the throne of the Cham king and reigned the country for 3 years. The center of Champa was relocated south to Vijaya in modern B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, Champa, p.34; Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, M·ªπ S∆°n Relics, p.75-76. After this, Champa also demanded this status, to be officially part of China, sending large amounts of tribute to the Chinese. When the Vietnamese sent Cham prisoners to China, the Chinese sent them back to Champa in 992. Several Chinese accounts record Cham arriving on Hainan. When the Cham capital fell in 982 to Vietnam, several Cham fled to Hainan during the Song dynasty. After the fall of the capital Indrapura, some Cham fled to Guangzhou as well. They became ancestors of the modern day Utsuls on Hainan, who are Muslims and still speak a Cham language. Champa rice was introduced from Champa to China during the reign of Emperor Zhenzong of Song. Sack of Vijaya by the Vi·ªát Conflict between Champa and ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát did not end, however, with the abandonment of Indrapura. Champa suffered further Viet attacks in 1021 and 1026. In 1044, a catastrophic battle resulted in the death of the Cham King Sa Dau and the sack of Vijaya by ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát under L√Ω Th√°i T√¥ng. The invaders captured elephants and musicians and even the Cham queen Mi E, who preserved her honor by throwing herself into the waves as her captors attempted to transport her to their country. Thirty thousand Cham were killed. Champa began to pay tribute to the Viet kings, including a white rhinoceros in 1065 and a white elephant in 1068 sent to L√Ω Th√°nh T√¥ng. In 1068, however, the King of Vijaya Rudravarman III (Che Cu) attacked ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát in order to reverse the setbacks of 1044. Again the Cham were defeated, and again ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát captured and burned Vijaya. These events were repeated in 1069 when L√Ω Th√°nh T√¥ng took a fleet to Champa, torched Vijaya, and captured Rudravarman III. The Champa king eventually purchased his freedom in exchange for three northern districts of his realm.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, M·ªπ S∆°n Relics, p.77; L√™ Th√†nh Kh√¥i, Histoire du Vietnam, p.163ff. Taking advantage of the debacle, a leader in southern Champa rebelled and established an independent kingdom. The northern kings were not able to reunite the country until 1084.Jean Boisselier, La statuaire du Champa, p.312. Khmer invasions of northern Champa In 1074, King Harivarman IV took the throne, restoring the temples at M·ªπ S∆°n and ushering in a period of relative prosperity. Harivarman made peace with ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát but provoked war with the Khmer of Angkor. In 1080, a Khmer army attacked Vijaya and other centers in northern Champa. Temples and monasteries were sacked and cultural treasures were carried off. After much misery, Cham troops under King Harivarman were able to defeat the invaders and restored the capital and temples.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, M·ªπ S∆°n Relics, p.78, 188; Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, Champa, p.33. An English translation of inscriptions at M·ªπ S∆°n commemorating the King's exploits is at pp.218ff. Around 1080, a new dynasty from the Korat Plateau in modern Thailand occupied the throne of Angkor in Cambodia. Soon enough, the kings of the new dynasty embarked on a program of empire-building. Rebuffed in their attempts to conquer ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát in the 1128, 1132, and 1138, they turned their attention to Champa. In 1145, a Khmer army under King Suryavarman II, the founder of Angkor Wat, occupied Vijaya, ending the reign of Jaya Indravarman III, and destroying the temples at M·ªπ S∆°n. The Khmer king then attempted the conquest of all of northern Champa. In 1149, however, the ruler of the southern principality of Panduranga, King Jaya Harivarman I, defeated the invaders and had himself consecrated king of kings in Vijaya. He spent the rest of his reign putting down rebellions in Amaravati and Panduranga.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, Champa, p.35; Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, M·ªπ S∆°n Relics, p.84. Sack of Angkor by the Cham This bas relief at the late 12th-century Angkorian temple called the Bayon depicts Cham mariners in action against the Khmer. In 1167, King Jaya Indravarman IV ascended to the throne in Champa. An inscription characterized him as brave, well-versed in weapons, and knowledgeable of philosophy, Mahayana theories, and the Dharmasutra.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, M·ªπ S∆°n Relics, p.87. After securing peace with ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát in 1170, Jaya Indravarman invaded Cambodia with inconclusive results. In 1177, however, his troops launched a surprise attack against the Khmer capital of Yasodharapura from warships piloted up the Mekong River to the great lake Tonl√© Sap in Cambodia. The invaders sacked the capital in 1177, killed the Khmer king Tribhuvanaditya, and made off with much booty.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, M·ªπ S∆°n Relics, p.89, 188; Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, Champa, p.36. China transferred crossbow technology to Champa. When the Chams sacked Angkor they used the Chinese siege crossbow. Crossbows were given to the Chams by China. Crossbows and archery while mounted were instructed to the Cham by a Chinese in 1171. Conquest of Vijaya by the Khmer The Khmer were rallied by a new king, Jayavarman VII, who drove the Cham from Cambodia in 1181. When Jaya Indravarman IV launched another attack against Cambodia in 1190, Jayavarman VII appointed a Cham prince named Vidyanandana to lead the Khmer army. Vidyanandana defeated the invaders and proceeded to occupy Vijaya and to capture Jaya Indravarman IV, whom he sent back to Angkor as a prisoner. Adopting the title of Shri Suryavarmadeva (or Suryavarman), Vidyanandana made himself king of Panduranga. He made Prince In, a brother-in-law of Jayavarman VII, \\"King Suryajayavarmadeva in the Nagara of Vijaya\\" (or Suryajayavarman). In 1191 a revolt at Viajaya drove Suryajayavarman back to Cambodia and enthroned Jaya Indravarman V. Vidyanandana occupied Viajaya, killed both Jaya Indravarman IV and Jaya Indravarman V, then \\"reigned without opposition over the Kingdom of Champa,\\" but he declared his independence from Cambodia.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, M·ªπ S∆°n Relics, p.89ff., 189. Khmer troops attempted unsuccessfully to regain control over Champa throughout the 1190s. In 1203, finally, Jayavarman VII's general Yuvaraja Mnagahna On Dhanapati Grama defeated Suryavarman, sending him into exile. Champa effectively became a province of Angkor, not to regain its independence until 1220.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, Champa, p.36. Jaya Paramesvaravarman II was crowned in 1226 and built his palace in Shri Vijaya, restoring the Champas to power. Tr·∫ßn Th√°i T√¥ng sent a punitive expedition against Champa for its continued piracy of the ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát coast, bringing back the Champa Queen Bo-da- la and the king's concubines as prisoners in 1252. Indravarman V was crowned in 1266, in time to become subject to the Mongols as \\"Imperial Prince of the second rank\\". Invasion of the Mongols When the Chinese Song dynasty fell to the Mongols, its loyalists fled to Champa where they plotted the reconquest of China. In the 1270s, Kublai Khan had established his capital and dynasty at Beijing and had toppled the southern Chinese Song dynasty. By 1280, he would turn his attention to the Cham and Viet kingdoms located in the territory of modern Vietnam. In 1283, Mongol troops of the Yuan dynasty under General Sogetu (Sagatou, So Tou, So To, or Sodu) invaded Champa and occupied Vijaya after capturing the citadel of Mou-cheng. However, Indravarman V fled into the mountains. Despite dispersion the Champa troops on a number of occasions, the Mongols were not \\"progressing one step into a country where they suffered from the heat, illness, and a lack of supplies.\\" Tr·∫ßn Th√°nh T√¥ng and then Tr·∫ßn Nh√¢n T√¥ng, just like Indravarman V, \\"obstinately refused\\" to present themselves to the Mongol Court or make any \\"act of vassalage\\", and refused the Mongols passage through Vi·ªát Nam. Thus the invasion of Champa had little lasting effect. Then, in 1285, the Mongol commander Togan was defeated and Sogetu was killed in a botched invasion of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát. By then, the Mongols \\"had lost a great number of men and officers...without having obtained any sizeable advantage.\\"L√™ Th√†nh Kh√¥i, Histoire du Vietnam, p.184. Military activities continued until 1289, soon after the severe Mongol setback at the Battle of B·∫°ch ƒê·∫±ng. However, Indravarman V did send an ambassador to Kublai on 6 Oct. 1285. Ch·∫ø M√¢n In 1307, the Cham King Jaya Simhavarman III (Ch·∫ø M√¢n), the founder of the still extant temple of Po Klong Garai in Panduranga, ceded two northern districts to ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát in exchange for the hand in marriage of a Viet princess, Huy·ªÅn Tr√¢n. Not long after the nuptials, the king died, and the princess returned to her northern home in order to avoid a Cham custom that would have required her to join her husband in death. However, the lands that Ch·∫ø M√¢n had rashly ceded were not returned. In order to regain these lands, and encouraged by the decline of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát in the course of the 14th century, the troops of Champa began to make regular incursions into the territory of their neighbor to the north.L√™ Th√†nh Kh√¥i, Histoire du Vietnam, p.193-194. Ch·∫ø Chi and Ch·∫ø Anan Ch·∫ø M√¢n's son, Ch·∫ø Chi, was captured in 1312 by Tr·∫ßn Anh T√¥ng and died a prisoner in Gia-lam Palace. Champa thus became a Vietnamese province. Ch·∫ø Anan was able to win back its independence in 1326. The Franciscan friar Odoric of Pordenone visited Champa in the 1320s. Ch·∫ø B·ªìng Nga ‚Äî the Red King The last strong king of the Cham was Ch·∫ø B·ªìng Nga, or Che Bunga, who ruled from 1360 until 1390. In Vietnamese stories he is called The Red King. Ch·∫ø B·ªìng Nga apparently managed to unite the Cham lands under his rule, and by 1372 he was strong enough to attack and almost conquer ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát from the sea. Cham forces sacked ThƒÉng Long, the capital city of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát (located at the site of modern Hanoi), in 1371 and then again in 1377. This second attack was soon after Tr·∫ßn Du·ªá T√¥ng died attacking Vijaya. Champa attacks in 1380, 1382, and 1383 were checked by the Vietnamese General H·ªì Qu√Ω Ly, future founder of the H·ªì dynasty. Ch·∫ø B·ªìng Nga was finally stopped in 1390 during another assault on the Vietnamese capital, when his royal barge received a musketry salvo. This was the last serious offensive by the Cham against ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát, but it helped spell the end of the Tr·∫ßn dynasty, which had forged its reputation in the wars against the Mongols a century earlier, but which now revealed itself as weak and ineffective in the face of the Cham invasions.Sardesai, Vietnam, Trials and Tribulations of a Nation, pp.33‚Äì34. Defeat and destruction of Vijaya by ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát During the reign of the Hongwu Emperor in Ming China, Champa sent tribute to China to garner Chinese help in the wars with Vietnam. The Hongwu Emperor was dead set against military actions in the region of Southeast Asia, merely rebuking the Vietnamese for their offensive. In 1401 and 1402, H·ªì Qu√Ω Ly sent expeditions against Champa, forcing Jaya Simhavarman V to relinquish half of his territory. Jaya Simhavarman V was able to regain his territory when the Yongle Emperor captured H·ªì Qu√Ω Ly and H·ªì H√°n Th∆∞∆°ng during the Ming‚ÄìH·ªì War of 1407. Jaya Simhavarman V and his son Nauk Glaun Vijaya then engaged in raiding the Khmer's under Ponhea Yat. China was asked to deal with Vietnam by Champa. Hostilities against Champa were initiated by the new Vietnamese dynasty. Following raids by Maha Vijaya into Hoa-chau in 1444 and 1445, ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát Emperor L√™ Nh√¢n T√¥ng, under the leadership of Tr·ªãnh Kh·∫£, launched an invasion of Champa in 1446. The attack was successful, Vijaya fell to the invaders, and \\"Maha Vijaya\\" was taken prisoner. Maha Qui-lai was then made Emperor of Champa. After the Champa king P'an-Lo T'ou-Ts'iuan, Tra-Toan, attacked Hoa-chau in 1469, ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát emperor L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng led a retaliatory invasion the following year with a vanguard fleet of 100,000 men, followed by 150,000 support civilians and settlers more ten days later. Vijaya was captured in 1471, along with Tra-Toan and 30,000 other Cham, while 60,000 Cham were killed. Tra-Toan \\"fell ill and died near Nghe An aboard the junk that was taking him away.\\" Champa kingdoms were reduced to principality status and autonomous regimes, which allowed Vietnamese court collect taxes from Champa people every year. According to linguistic study Acehnese people of northern Sumatra and Cham are related through the Aceh‚ÄìChamic languages. At least 60,000 Cham people were killed and 30,000 were taken as slaves by the Vietnamese army. The capital of Vijaya was obliterated. As a result of the victory, L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng annexed the principalities of Amaravati and Vijaya. This defeat caused the first major Cham emigration, particularly to Cambodia and Malacca.L√™ Th√†nh Kh√¥i, Histoire du Vietnam, p.243. The trade in Vietnamese ceramics was damaged due to the plummet in trade by Cham merchants after the invasion. After the war, the Vietnamese navy took patrol over the South China sea trade routes, established Hoi An as the trade city, freely exporting Vietnamese products to Southeast Asia. Vietnamese influences and immigrants now extended into the Central Highland and Mekong Delta. The Chinese scholar Âê≥Ê®∏ Wu Pu recommended that to help stop the Vietnamese, China should help resuscitate the Champa Kingdom. Later history of Champa What remained of historical Champa was the southern principality of Panduranga, where the Cham general Bo Tri-tri proclaimed himself king, and offered vassalage to L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng. Under the protection of Dai-Viet, it preserved some of its independence. This was the starting point of the modern Cham Lords in the principality of Panduranga (Phan Rang, Phan Ri and Phan Thi·∫øt). The Portuguese's fort on Malacca was counterattacked by the Johor Sultanate along with an expeditionary force from Champa in 1594. Cambodia was the refuge of Chams who fled along with Po Chien after Champa lost more lands in 1720 to the Vietnamese. When the Ming dynasty in China fell, Chinese refugees fled south and extensively settled on Cham lands and in Cambodia. Most of these Chinese were young men, and they took Cham women as wives. Their children identified more with Chinese culture. This migration occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries. The Vietnamese subjugated Ph√∫ Y√™n in 1578, Cam Ranh in 1653, and Tran Thuan Than in 1692. Cham provinces were seized by the Nguy·ªÖn Lords. An anti-Vietnamese rebellion by the Cham occurred in 1728 after the passing away of their ruler Po Saktiraydaputih. Panduranga, the last remnant of the Cham Kingdom, fell in 1832 to the Emperor Minh M·∫°ng. The Cham Muslim leader Katip Suma was educated in Kelantan and came back to Champa to declare a Jihad against the Vietnamese after Emperor Minh M·∫°ng's annexation of Champa.(Extracted from Truong Van Mon, \\"The Raja Praong Ritual: a Memory of the sea in Cham- Malay Relations\\", in Memory And Knowledge Of The Sea In South Asia, Institute of Ocean and Earth Sciences, University of Malaya, Monograph Series 3, pp, 97-111. International Seminar on Maritime Culture and Geopolitics & Workshop on Bajau Laut Music and Dance\\", Institute of Ocean and Earth Sciences and the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, University of Malaya, 23-24/2008) The Vietnamese coercively fed lizard and pig meat to Cham Muslims and cow meat to Cham Hindus against their will to punish them and assimilate them to Vietnamese culture. Modern status Today, the Chams are recognized as one of official 54 ethnic groups in Vietnam. Ethnic Chams in the Mekong Delta have also been economically marginalized and pushed into poverty by Vietnamese policies, with ethnic Vietnamese Kinh settling on majority Cham land with state support, and religious practices of minorities have been targeted for elimination by the government.

In the program, two families, usually from different social classes and lifestyles, swap wives/mothers ‚Äì and sometimes husbands ‚Äì for two weeks. Actor John Schwab narrated the program on ABC from 2004 to 2010. The program will usually deliberately swap wives with dramatically different lifestyles, such as a messy wife swapping with a fastidiously neat one, or a wife who only cooks vegan swapped with a non vegan wife, documenting the cultural and social differences that the two families discover with the new family member. A spin- off series featuring celebrities debuted January 2, 2012 under the title Celebrity Wife Swap and lasted for 4 seasons. On March 8, 2018, it was announced that CMT had picked up the series for a 10-episode reboot under its original format. However, it was later announced that the reboot was premiered on April 4, 2019 on Paramount Network. On September 5, 2019, the series was renewed for a 20-episode twelfth season which premiered on February 13, 2020. On September 22, 2020, Paramount Network cancelled the series, as part of the network's shift to movies. Synopsis During the first week, the new wife must adhere to exactly the same rules and lifestyle of the wife she is replacing. Each wife leaves a house manual which explains her role in the family and the duties she holds. This helps to determine what rules the wives will apply at the \\"rules change ceremony\\". During the second week, the new wives are allowed to establish their own rules, and their new families must adhere to these new household rules. It usually takes a while for the families to adjust to this policy, meanwhile the wives disburse a sum of money to the family they have become involved with, to do what the wives see fit to spend it on. At the end of the two weeks, the two couples all meet together for the first time, and the wives, along with their husbands, discuss how they felt about the two weeks. This often descends into personal insults and has degenerated into violence at least twice. More often than not, however, both families reach toward a middle ground and express that they have learned from the experience. Sometimes, the table meeting is a very heartfelt and emotional time for the two families who sometimes have complete and mutual respect for each other. A few weeks later, the cameras return to record what changes have occurred since the swap.  Legal issues   Trading Spouses  In early 2004, ABC announced a U.S. version of the British show Wife Swap, to be called Trading Moms, having outbid Fox Network for the rights for the format in the U.S. In June the same year, Fox publicized a program with an almost identical format to Wife Swap entitled Trading Spouses, which it began broadcasting on July 1.\\"Spouse swap a fit for Fox: Net snipes at Alphabet with Trading Spouses\\" article from Variety ABC then reverted to the original UK title for their series, which began on September 26. In December 2004, RDF Media sued Fox for copyright infringement for reproducing the Wife Swap format without their permission.\\"Wife Swap sues Trading Spouses\\" article from post- gazette.com In 2008, FOX sold the rights to the show to CMT, ending the run. Gay swap In November 2005, Jeffrey Bedford, a participant in the American series, sued ABC network for trading his wife for a gay man. He accused ABC of being dishonest, not allowing him contact with his wife, and making him miss his lessons at college. He claimed that, when he ceased participating with the production of the episode, ABC threatened that it would not tell him his wife's whereabouts and would not pay for his wife's return home. He sued for over $10 million, although a spokesman revealed that the contract stated the spouse could be of either gender. In 2007, the UK version began a search for more gay or lesbian swaps.  Alicia Guastaferro  In March 2010, Alicia Guastaferro sued ABC for $100 million, claiming that her appearance and depiction on a 2008 episode of Wife Swap led to her public embarrassment and that she suffered from panic attacks and suicidal tendencies as a result. Guastaferro alleged that many of the scenes that depicted her as a \\"spoiled brat\\" were staged and that she had been purposely asked to \\"act a little more spoiled.\\" The lawsuit was settled out of court later that same year and the terms were not disclosed to the press. Notable episodes Wife Swap has aired several unique episodes in its history. In 2004, The Spolansky Family had a unique episode as they were the first incredibly affluent family to be shown on the program. Jodi and Steven were given immensely harsh criticism for their entitled behavior and posh-like attitude on the show, like when Steven makes sarcastic and cruel remarks about Lynn's family (the swapping wife) and her family's financial status, or when Jodi made comments about doing Lynn's job (which is chopping wood for 2 hours a day) and then proceeded to put down Brad (the husband she was swapping with) for his family's lifestyle. They live on the glamorous Upper East Side in New York City, famously seen on The CW's Gossip Girl series where Jodi Spolansky is relatively comparable to Lily Van Der Woodsen, a Manhattan socialite and philanthropist and Steven Spolansky is relatively comparable to Bart Bass, a wealthy business mogul with a harsh attitude. They both were looked upon as neglectful parents as they were never really around their children and instead either going out shopping, out to the gym, working or out to dinner with just themselves alone. This episode also included The Bradleys, a New Jersey rural farm family with low income, the complete opposite of The Spolanskys. For their hundredth episode on March 13, 2009, the U.S. version selected 24 families to participate in a contest to reswap. Viewers voting in October 2008 picked the artistic/psychic Silver family of Florida and the storm- chasing/UFO-hunting Heenes of Colorado. The Heenes later gained notoriety in the national media when they were involved in the Balloon boy hoax. According to Denver, Colorado blogger Bill Husted, \\"It sounds like a good match\\". But, \\"distressingly\\", L.A. Times writer Jon Caramancia wrote, \\"it's clear they haven't learned a thing\\". In 2009, an episode of Wife Swap aired featuring six-year-old Curtis Holland. In this episode, Curtis and his calorie-loving family from North Carolina experience a week at the hands of fitness instructor Joy Brown who tries to force the family to change their unhealthy lifestyle. Throughout the episode, Holland frequently voices his distaste for Joy's fitness regime. After the episode aired, Holland became very recognizable and had even been approached to film a reality show as well as advertise for a bacon company, both of which did not work out. A clip from the episode has received 12.5 million views as of June 2018. In 2015, Holland created a GoFundMe page to raise money for a car, stating that he never received any money from appearing on Wife Swap. The GoFundMe page was later removed.

History   Willenhall School Sports College  Willenhall School Sports College was a foundation school that was originally known as Willenhall Comprehensive School until its acquisition of Sports College status through the specialist schools programme in 2001. In 2005, it acquired secondary status as a Science College. In the years before becoming an academy, it was the biggest secondary school in the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall with over 1600 pupils and 150 staff. The school day began at 8.30am and finished early at 2.40pm, however extra-curricular clubs continued until 5.25pm. Pupils were split into one of eight houses. Whilst pupils in Year Seven had their own form, pupils in Years Eight - Eleven were in mixed year forms. Each house was made up of six forms. The school, which was headed by Mrs VP Till in its final years, also housed a community centre, a community library and a fitness suite (available for use by the local community). According to Government statistics the school was under achieving in the 2007 GCSE Results, but was ranked in the middle of fellow senior schools in Walsall. The 2009 GCSE results were the school's best ever. Overall 74% of pupils achieved five Grades A*-C at GCSE Level, with 34% achieving five including Maths and English. In A Level results, 94% of students passed their exams, with a total of 41 A Grades having been awarded. Willenhall E-Act Academy was put on the map when Megan Handley, an alum of the school, was seen cheering from the stands of the Molineux two weeks running on popular football Television show, Match of the Day. Tgis is thought to have boosted the prestige of the school tenfold.  Colleges  Willenhall E-ACT Academy has four \\"colleges\\": blue, green, red, and yellow. The colleges compete against each other in a wide variety of competitions both sporting and academic.  Statutory inspections  In March 2015 the statutory inspection body OFSTED found that the school \\"requires improvement\\", but by March 2017 this had declined further, to \\"inadequate\\", with pupils' behavioural standards attracting particular criticism. In June 2017, staff members of the National Union of Teachers and NASUWT unions carried out a strike, over 'unreasonable' management and the safety of staff, with a further two strike days planned for July of the same year.

The latter grew up to be so pretty that Creon's wife sold her away as a slave, fearing that Creon might abandon her in favor of the maiden.

It is located along Lake Michigan just north of Illinois and includes grassy wetlands, wooded areas, and the Kenosha Sand Dunes at its northern tip. it is home to an abundance of wildlife. It was designated a Wisconsin State Natural Area in 1967 and a National Natural Landmark in 1973. Together with surrounding areas, and south to Illinois Beach State Park, it constitutes an internationally recognized wetland of importance under the Ramsar Convention, called the Chiwaukee Illinois Beach Lake Plain. History The Chiwaukee Prairie was formed at the end of the Last Glacial Period, over 10,000 years ago. As lake water receded from the older Toleston Shoreline, wind and wave action accumulated a sand along the current Lake Michigan shoreline. This sediment was stabilized by sand-binding grasses. The decaying plant material contributed humus which supported shrubs and native wildflowers. Eventually, larger trees such as oaks, birch and cottonwood took root. Today, the prairie appears as a series of sandy ridges, wet swales and woodland areas. Chiwaukee Prairie and the Illinois Beach to the south are referred to as a Lake Plain. In 1924, Edith Rockefeller McCormick bought 1800 acres from 80th street south to Tobin Road (116th Street) and west to Sheridan Road. This was to be the site of a model city named Edithton Beach. At about the same time, a second development from 116th Street south to the state line, named Chiwaukee on the Lake, was launched. Surveyors divided the acreage into lots, and a nine-hole golf course was completed. Developers built few large homes along Lake Michigan, but wet soil made building elsewhere difficult. The Great Depression of 1929 brought an end to both developments. In 1936, the Wisconsin State Planning Commission recommended that the sand dunes and land extending south to the Illinois state line be acquired as a state park. The plan died for lack of funds and sufficient local interest. In 1947, a group of developers led by Joseph E. Shaffron bought most of the land to build homes for middle class families. Shaffron named the development Carol Beach, after his daughter. Shaffron built ranch-style houses, but once again drainage problems on many lots made them difficult to develop. Wisconsin Power Company bought another 130 acres of sand dunes just north of Carol Beach for a potential power plant. In the 1960s, a group of concerned citizens, lead by Phil Sander and Al Krampert, organized to save the prairie by acquiring undeveloped tracts of land. The Nature Conservancy supported their efforts. Hundreds of private property owners were tracked down and solicited. Some donated their land. Other properties were purchased as funds became available. In 1967 in Wisconsin deemed Chiwaukee Prairie a State Natural Area. The National Park Service recognized it as a National Natural Landmark in 1973. In 1993, WEC Energy Group donated 62 acres to the Nature Conservancy adding the Kenosha Sand Dunes to Chiwaukee Prairie. Many properties have been deeded to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) or the University of Wisconsin-Parkside, and all are managed by the WDNR. In 2015, the entire Lake Plain from Chiwaukee Prairie south was designated a Ramsar wetland of International Significance. The group of citizens that saved the prairie from development is now constituted as the Chiwaukee Prairie Preservation Fund. They continue to raise money and organize efforts to restore and maintain the land and its wildlife. Since 2014, the Nature Conservancy has acquired another 150 acres just east of Sheridan Road from 116th Street south towards the Illinois border. Dubbed the \\"Chiwaukee West Restoration Area,\\" the land is being cleared of invasive species and will be seeded with native plant species. thumb Flora and fauna The Chiwaukee Prairie is one of the most complete prairie complexes in Wisconsin. It offers a variety of habitats from marshy grasslands, to sand dunes and wooded areas. And it supports a large variety flora and fauna, some of which are rare or endangered. The prairie has over 400 vascular plant species. There are ferns, lichens, rushes and aquatic plants. There are shrubs such as sumac, red raspberry and an abundance of red-twig dogwood. There are some 80 different kinds of sedges and grasses. And is there is a bewildering assortment of flowers including blazing stars, black-eyed susan, goldenrod, tickseed, milkweed, Queen Anne‚Äôs-lace, lobelias, asters, thistles, and sunflowers. These bloom at various times throughout the warmer months. In the higher and drier parts of the prairie, there are open woodlands of cottonwood, birch, maples and oaks. The prairie is home to more that 75 types of birds including gulls, ducks, vireos, swallows, wrens, finches, orioles, woodpeckers, turkey, hawks, kestrels, and bald eagle. Additionally, it is a stop-over site for a succession of migratory birds. The prairie supports an abundance of insects, butterflies, amphibians, and reptiles, including the rare Blanding's turtle (a species of special concern). The prairie is also home to many mammals such as woodchucks, minks, red foxes, coyotes, and the rare Franklin's ground squirrel.

Isabelle plays a destitute medical student who begins taking clients from the extreme body modification community to solve her financial troubles. Plot Desperate for funds, surgical student Mary applies for work at a strip club, where she meets Billy Barker, the club owner. Billy is in need of a medical professional to patch up a man bleeding in his club's basement, the obvious victim of illegal dealings, and offers Mary $5,000 to perform emergency surgery, no questions asked. Mary accepts the money, but spends the next few days terrified the criminal activity she got involved in will follow her home. Mary is approached by Beatress Johnson, a stripper at the club where Mary applied. Beatress has had extreme plastic surgery to make herself resemble Betty Boop. She offers Mary a large sum of money to perform illegal surgery on a friend of hers, Ruby Realgirl, in a veterinary clinic. Ruby wishes to be transformed into a human doll, and has been unable to find a surgeon willing to complete the last step in her transformation: removing her nipples, all external genitalia, and partially suturing her vulva shut. Mary accepts, and a follow-up post on Ruby's website introduces Mary to the world of extreme body modification. Mary begins her residency in the surgical specialty, and her teachers and mentors praise her promising skills. Mary is invited by a doctor named Dr. Walsh to what she believes is a networking party with several of the head surgeons at her hospital; however, she finds she was the only young resident invited. The surgeons commit lewd acts on the others in attendance, who are escorts. While at the party, Mary is drugged and raped by her former teacher, Dr. Alan Grant, who films the assault. Mary later drops out of her residency. With word quickly spreading through dark web channels that \\"Bloody Mary\\" is a surgeon of great skill willing to perform any extreme surgery desired, Mary goes into consensual body modification surgery full- time. She hires Billy and his enforcers to kidnap Grant and deliver him to her apartment, where she holds him hostage and uses him as \\"practice\\" material for her extreme surgeries, using pictures of him for her portfolio. Mary is approached by police detective Dolor, who asks about the disappearance of Dr. Grant and the collection of disturbing tapes found in his apartment, explaining that Dr. Walsh gave him a long list of women who might bear a grudge against Dr. Grant, and that Mary was on the list. Billy, who has become attached to Mary, kidnaps and beats Dr. Walsh on her behalf. While torturing Dr. Grant, Mary is discovered and attacked by a security guard, who attempts to free him, but Mary bludgeons him to death. Detective Dolor confronts Mary again, believing that she was a victim of one of the sex parties hosted by the two missing doctors and hoping to help her. Mary begins to unravel from the police interest and worries that a tape of her rape will be found. Meanwhile, Ruby's husband, vengeful after seeing his newly modified wife, tortures Beatress to near death for Mary‚Äôs location before ambushing Mary at her house with a knife. Mary attempts to suture her own wound shut but ultimately bleeds to death in her operating room, to be discovered by the police. Cast * Katharine Isabelle as Mary Mason, a medical school student and aspiring surgeon. Out of desperation, she performs extreme body modification surgeries to solve her financial issues. * Antonio Cupo as Billy Barker, the owner of the strip club where Mary applies for a job. * Tristan Risk as Beatress Johnson, a stripper who has had herself surgically altered to resemble Betty Boop. * David Lovgren as Dr. Alan Grant, Mary's professor at medical school. * Paula Lindberg as Ruby Realgirl, a fashion designer who wishes to become a human doll. * Julia Maxwell as Tessa, Beatress' niece who works as a receptionist at a veterinary clinic. * John Emmet Tracy as Detective Dolor, a Police Detective who is suspicious of Mary's involvement in Dr. Grant's disappearance. * Twan Holliday as Lance Delgreggo, one of Billy's enforcers. * Travis Watters as Mr. Realgirl, Ruby's husband.  Cameos  The Soskas make an appearance as the demon twins from Berlin; their father, Marius, also appears in a minor role as Dr. Janusz, a professor at the medical school. Production The film was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. There were no visual effects; all effects are either practical, or Mary's patients are members of the real-life body modification community. The role of Mary was written specifically for Katharine Isabelle. The script was written while the Soskas were trying to sell their film Dead Hooker in a Trunk, and it mirrors some of the experiences that they had in the film industry, such as meeting sleazy people that seem initially reputable.

The release includes a behind-the-scenes documentary with cast and crew as well as a feature titled An American Mary in London, which detailed the world premiere. Reception The film received generally mixed reviews, with praise for Isabelle‚Äôs performance and the film‚Äôs use of black comedy, but criticism for the film‚Äôs abrupt ending. Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 60% of 47 surveyed critics gave positive reviews; the average rating was 5.5/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"It suffers a bit from some uneven acting and an underwhelming climax, but American Mary utilizes pitch black humor and striking visuals to deliver gory, freaky thrills for body horror enthusiasts\\". It has score of 46 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 15 reviews. Andy Webster of The New York Times designated it a NYT Critics' Pick and wrote that American Mary \\"combines gore, quiet dread, feminist conviction and a visual classicism, often using a red palette, with impressive, unbelabored dexterity.\\" Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York rated the film 2/5 and wrote that the film starts out promising but ends up \\"going for the gross-out\\". In a mixed review, Dennis Harvey of Variety called the film \\"outre and entertaining\\" but \\"doesn't develop all its narrative and thematic ideas to the fullest.\\" Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film \\"turn[s] slack and unfocused after an enticingly lurid, wickedly tense first half.\\" References External links   Category:2012 films Category:2012 horror films Category:Body modification Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian slasher films Category:Films directed by the Soska sisters Category:Films shot in Vancouver Category:Rape and revenge films Category:Canadian splatter films ","title":"American Mary"},{"id":"34425226","text":"Reasonably Priced Comics is an American publisher of comic books, known for publication of the detective series Jack Hammer and its self-titled anthology.

Life restoration of S. maxima Scheenstia is frequently pictured as the prey of the dinosaur Baryonyx walkeri because the scales and teeth of these fish were found in the stomach region of a fossil B. walkeri specimen. The fish remains were previously referred to the related genus Lepidotes, but all Late Jurassic‚ÄìEarly Cretaceous species of that genus have since been re- classified as Scheenstia following detailed phylogenetic analysis. Classification Scheenstia is related to the genus Lepidotes. The latter has been one of the greatest actinopterygian wastebasket taxa, with one 2012 study finding species referrable to a minimum of three different and distantly related genera. Scheenstia is also related to Isanichthys. A cladogram showing the relations of Neopterygii was published in the review, and a simplified version labelling the previous species of Lepidotes is shown here.

Function  IL1RL1 is a member of the Toll-like receptor superfamily based on the function of its intracellular TIR domain, but its extracellular region is composed of immunoglobulin domains. Unlike other members of the family IL1RL1 does not induce an inflammatory response through activation of NF-Œ∫B, although it does activate MAP kinases. ST2 is a member of the interleukin 1 receptor family. The ST2 protein has two isoforms and is directly implicated in the progression of cardiac disease: a soluble form (referred to as soluble ST2 or sST2) and a membrane-bound receptor form (referred to as the ST2 receptor or ST2L). When the myocardium is stretched, the ST2 gene is upregulated, increasing the concentration of circulating soluble ST2. The ligand for ST2 is the cytokine Interleukin-33(IL-33). Binding of IL-33 to the ST2 receptor, in response to cardiac disease or injury, such as an ischemic event, elicits a cardioprotective effect resulting in preserved cardiac function. This cardioprotective IL-33 signal is counterbalanced by the level of soluble ST2, which binds IL-33 and makes it unavailable to the ST2 receptor for cardioprotective signaling. As a result, the heart is subjected to greater stress in the presence of high levels of soluble ST2.  Molecular biology  The gene is found on the long arm of Chromosome 2 (2q12). It is 40,536 bases long and is located on the Watson (plus) strand. It encodes a protein of 556 amino acids (molecular weight 63,358 Da). Both membrane bound and soluble forms are known. The protein is known to interact with MyD88, IRAK1, IRAK4 and TRAF6. It appears to be essential for the normal function of T helper cells type 2 (Th2 cells) . Clinical significance  Mutations in this gene have been linked to atopic dermatitis and asthma. The protein encoded by this gene serves as a cardiac biomarker.

Classification Sorbinichthys was described for the first time in 2000 by Bannikov and Bacchia and, on the basis of specimens found in Lebanon, in the En Nammoura. These specimens were designated as S. elusivo, the type species, was placed in a newly erected family Sorbinichthyidae. Similar fossils from Morocco were described as the species S. africanus, in 2011 . Sorbinichthys belongs to the Ellimmichthyiformes, a group of bony fish closely related to herring and sardines, that lived from the Cretaceous until the Eocene. Description The genus contains two species, S. elusivo (found in Lebanon) and S. africanus (from Morocco). The Lebanese species could reach a length of over 15 cm, while S. africanus was smaller and reaching a length of about 5 cm. Sorbinichthys had a body high and narrow, and was equipped with a tip radius of the second dorsal very long (longer in S. elusivo than in S. africanus). The scales were diamond-shaped, and along the dorsal edge of the back were diamond-shaped scutes. The dorsal, caudal, pelvic and pectoral fins either had, or, in the case of the pectoral fins, were modified into long filaments. These filaments were visible in the original fossils only until after preparation was completed, hence the specific epithet elusivo (\\"hidden\\"), referring to how the long, delicate filaments were not discovered until afterwards.

Built in the early fourteenth century, it was from the sixteenth century to the early eighteenth century the principal seat of the Fitzwilliam family, who later acquired the title Viscount Fitzwilliam. After the Fitzwiliams moved to Mount Merrion House in about 1710 the castle fell into ruin, and it was demolished in 1780. No trace of Merrion Castle survives today. It was located opposite Merrion Gates, on the site of St. Mary's Home and School for the Blind. Its location, and the modern site of St.Mary's, can be seen on historical maps. Early history The first mention of a castle at Merrion is in about 1334, when it was in the possession of Thomas Bagod, a descendant of that Sir Robert Bagod who had built Baggotrath Castle about 1280.Ball, F. Elrington History of Dublin Alexander Thom and Co. 1902-1920 Vol. 2 p.4 In the late fourteenth century Merrion Castle was owned by Sir John Cruise, a leading diplomat and soldier. In the fifteenth century both castles came into the possession of the Fitzwilliam family, who over the tears became the most substantial landowners in Dublin; James Fitzwilliam, the Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer, married Sir John Cruises's daughter. Until the late sixteenth century Baggotrath was the Fitzwilliams' favoured possession, for possession of which they fought a bitter private war with the Cornwalsh family in the 1440s. It was Sir Thomas Fitzwiliam, grandfather of the first Viscount, who in the reign of Elizabeth I made Merrion Castle the principal family residence.Ball p.8 Civil War and Restoration During the English Civil War, possession of such a strong fortress close to Dublin was clearly of crucial importance to both sides in the conflict. The Fitzwilliams, who were staunch Royalists, installed a strong garrison; but in June 1642 the castle was betrayed to the Parliamentary side,Ball p.13 and remained in Parliament's hands until the Restoration. The second Viscount, Oliver Fitzwilliam, later Earl of Tyrconnell, who had some influence with Oliver Cromwell's son Henry, pleaded for its return, but without success. Given the traditional loyalty of his family to the Stuart dynasty, he might well have expected its speedy recovery in 1660; but the bitter divisions in post-Restoration Ireland, which saw Tyrconnell accused by his enemies of being a supporter of Oliver Cromwell, caused a delay in the full restitution of his lands, and he did not recover Merrion until 1663.Ball p.19 Though it had suffered much damage during the military occupation, Merrion was still a substantial dwelling. For the purpose of the hearth tax in 1662-3 it was assessed at sixteen hearths, proving it to be one of the largest private dwellings in Dublin. Lord Tyrconnell in his last years did much to improve the castle, where he died in 1667. It remained the main family residence until 1710 when Richard FitzWilliam, 5th Viscount FitzWilliam began the building of Mount Merrion House. Ruins of Merrion Castle After 1710 the castle was entirely abandoned and it quickly fell into decay. By the late 1720s it seems to have been little more than a ruin, and the newspapers reported that the site was infested with large and savage rodents called .Walsh's Impartial Newsletter 16 May 1729 The \\"\\" was almost certainly the brown rat, which is recorded in Ireland from 1722, a few years ahead of its first appearance in England.Perry, Richard Wildlife in Britain and Ireland Redwood Burn Ltd. 1978 p.112 Gabriel Beranger sketched the ruins around 1765. Austin Cooper surveyed them in May 1780, but on a second visit found the castle being demolished.Ball p.21 The Topographical Dictionary of Ireland 1837 states that some ivy covered ruins of the castle still existed at that time.

Reverter I de La Guardia (died 1142 or 1144), viscount of Barcelona, was a Catalan adventurer and military leader who defended the Almoravid caliphate in North Africa against the Almohad onslaught. He was the son of Guislabert II, viscount of Barcelona, a title, which at that time, had lost much of its prestige. He married a woman known as Ermesindis and had several sons with her. During his long absence from the county, his nephew, Guillem, appear to have ruled in his name over his estates. As a feudatory of the count of Barcelona, he is believed to have been captured by the Almoravids during a battle along the Ebro river in the 1120s, probably 1126. He remained a prisoner of war in North Africa for about a decade until the emergence of the Almohad threat in the Maghrib al-Aqsa induced the emir, Ali ibn Yusuf, to levy a troop of mercenaries among the captive Spanish soldiers (c.1132). Reverter agreed to lead this force, with the express permission of the count of Barcelona. Reverter and his Christian mercenaries appear to have been very successful at stemming the advance of the Almohads for several years. The Catalan knight may even have been entrusted with the command of the entire Almoravid army but he was killed in battle in 1142 or 1144, possibly near Tlemcen, and his corpse was crucified by the Zenatas. After his death, the Almoravid emirate crumbled rapidly. Two of his sons seem to have fought alongside Reverter in the armies of the caliph. Berenguer became the new viscount at the death of his father and returned in Spain and Abu-l-Hasan who took the command of the Christian contingent before converting to Islam. The life of Reverter illustrates two important trends of the period: the expansionist policies of the counts of Barcelona over the Western Mediterranean and the tendency of medieval warriors to easily cross religious lines to find employment.

It takes its name from the Mugello, an area to the north-east of Florence. It is not officially recognised as a breed in Italy, but is being considered for recognition. History The Mugellese is named after the Mugello, a historic and rural region which extends to the north-east of Florence and which traditionally corresponds with the comuni of Barberino di Mugello, Borgo San Lorenzo, Dicomano, San Piero a Sieve, Scarperia, Vaglia and Vicchio. It is one of the few dwarf breeds in Italy, others being the Mericanel della Brianza and the P√©poi. The Mugellese is a traditional chicken breed of Tuscany, of uncertain origins. It was once extensively kept not only in the Tuscan countryside, but also in the gardens or on the balconies of town houses, perhaps as a pet. It was traditional for grandparents to give a pair of Mugellesi to a child who had reached an age to care for them. Once very common, it became rare in the second half of the 20th century; it is now in a phase of recovery, selection and improvement. In early 2012, the Mugellese was not officially recognised by the Federazione Italiana Associazioni Avicole, but was under consideration. A draft standard had been prepared, but not yet approved. Characteristics The colouring of the Mugellese is dark golden (partridge); hens may also be wheaten buff. The skin is white and legs are pale or flesh-coloured. The comb is single, with 4‚Äì6 points. The ear-lobes range from red to white, which last is preferred. Average weight is for cocks, for hens. The eggs are small and ivory-white. The Mugellese is an active and lively breed. Although small, cocks are highly aggressive towards other cocks. Hens are good sitters, and may sit almost year-round. In the past, capons were often used to care for hatchlings. Birds are robust and resistant to heat and cold, and can be kept in the open all year. If allowed to, they roost in trees.

Ulmer (also credited with original story) and featuring top-billed John Carradine and Gale Sondergaard whose performance in one of 1936's Academy Award for Best Picture nominees, Anthony Adverse, earned her the first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Isle of Forgotten Sins was subsequently reissued in a version cut from 82 to 74 minutes and retitled Monsoon. It proved to be the final film role for German-American actress Betty Amann as well as the last feature for producer Peter R. Van Duinen's Atlantis Pictures, a unit whose films had a higher budget then most of PRC's releases.p.10 Bock, Hans-Michael & Bergfelder, Tim. The Concise Cinegraph: Encyclopaedia of German Cinema Berghahn Books, 30/12/2009 Third-listed supporting actor Sidney Toler worked on this PRC title between the finish of his Charlie Chan films at 20th Century Fox and just before their resumption at Monogram Pictures. The film features several songs (with Carradine singing \\"Whiskey Johnny\\"), an underwater sequence using a marionette and a tropical monsoon climax. The pre- release working title was Island of Forgotten Sins. Plot At the \\"Isle of Forgotten Sins\\" Somewhere on one of the English-speaking South Sea Islands, at an indefinite present time, with no mention of the fact that it is the middle of World War II, Marge (Gale Sondergaard) is the proprietress of a nightclub/restaurant/gambling hall/brothel called \\"Isle of Forgotten Sins\\". In the morning, she knocks on the doors of the individual rooms of her sleeping hostesses, Olga (Betty Amann), Bobbie (Patti McCarty), Mimi (Marian Colby), and Christine (Tala Birell) announcing, \\"get up, the Southern Queen is here\\". Riding in a launch from the ship is an inspector from the \\"Criminal Investigation Bureau\\" who compares a fingerprint card with a photograph of \\"Betty Nelson\\" to one with a photo of a somewhat older \\"Marge Williams\\", shows it to the commissioner (unbilled C. Montague Shaw) and tells him, \\"we'll go there tonight\\". Marge, surrounded by eight hostesses, is asked by one, \\"what can we do to please him?\\" and answers, \\"he doesn't want to be pleased, he's looking for an excuse to close us up\\". As the sarong-clad girls leave, one of them, Diane (Rita Quigley) tells Marge, \\"oh, I suppose it's silly of me but I feel so self-conscious in this costume\\" and Marge responds, \\"I know how it is when your modesty's taking a beating, don't let it get you down\\". On Burke's boat On a small boat moored in the harbor, its owner, deep sea diver Jack Burke (Frank Fenton), is shaving in preparation of visiting Marge's place, while his diving partner/friendly rival Mike Clancy (John Carradine) awakens from drunken sleep to find that Burke has tied him to the bunk bed. He offers to pay for drinks if Burke unties him, but Burke wants to see the cash first. Clancy tells him that it's in his pocket, so Burke reaches in, takes all of it, and leaves without untying him, as Clancy shouts angrily and struggles to loosen the bonds. The Isle in turmoil The inspector and the commissioner arrive at Marge's and, after having been seated at their table, the commissioner says, \\"don't look so disappointed, you'll see murder and mayhem any moment now\\" and the inspector answers, \\"I [it?] wouldn't surprise me any\\". Mimi comes out to sing \\"In Pango\\" [by Leo Erdody and Ann Levitt] (\\"I roamed all the world seeking gladness, but found in my heart only sadness\\") accompanied by two guitarists, a percussionist and a female accordionist. At another table, Krogan (Sidney Toler) is sitting with Johnny Pacific (Rick Vallin) and, when Diane serves them drinks, tries to grab her bare arm. As she pulls away, he laughs unpleasantly while, observing disapprovingly from his table, the inspector comments, \\"rather unusual there\\". When Burke enters, Krogan tells Johnny Pacific, \\"the other will be showing up any minute now, when Burke hits this port, Clancy's never far behind\\". Burke is waiting for Marge in her upstairs room, explaining that Clancy drowned and giving her the pocket watch she once gifted to Clancy. Meanwhile, Clancy enters and asks Christine, \\"where's Marge?\\", while in her upstairs office, Marge tells Burke that since Mike Clancy was the reason she stayed, she'll be leaving and Burke suggests, \\"that with Mike gone, you might marry me\\". Before she can answer, Clancy knocks on the door and, as the astonished and relieved Marge tells him what happened, asks her to step outside, and starts trading punches with Burke. The fistfight progresses from Marge's room to the downstairs dining area, as tables and chairs are broken and overturned. Clancy ultimately knocks out Burke and is proclaimed as \\"the winner\\" by Krogan, who tells everybody, \\"The drinks are on me\\", as all the disarranged diners smile and break into happy applause. Krogan continues, \\"I have another little treat for you\\", explaining that \\"a nameless young man whom I fished out of the sea so I called him Johnny Pacific\\" will entertain. Johnny Pacific goes to the piano and plays the second movement (Adagio cantabile) of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 8 (the ') and, while the familiar classical theme continues to be heard in the background, Clancy deals with Burke who regains consciousness and starts swinging fists, by telling him that he recognized Krogan and Johnny Pacific as the captain and purser of the steamship Tropic Star which, six months earlier, disappeared in the Coral Sea with three million dollars in gold, and that they must have hidden the loot, but \\"we can find it first\\". Burke agrees and Marge gives Clancy the money to finance the expedition, but just after he and Burke leave her place, a scream is heard from upstairs, then a shot, and a customer (unbilled I. Stanford Jolley) staggers out and falls from the upper landing. Olga, holding a gun, runs downstairs in front of everybody and then up another staircase. The dying man blurts out, \\"that girl, she took my money\\", to the inspector, who announces that \\"I am placing you all under technical arrest as material witnesses\\". As Krogan, Johnny Pacific and the diners rush for the exits, Marge tells the girls that \\"we're between the devil and the deep and that's no quotation\\", as they grab money from the cash register and head for Burke's boat. Hurried departure Alone on the boat, as they prepare to leave port, Clancy tells Burke, \\"there'll be so much money for both of us, there'll be no reason for us to doublecross each other\\" and sings, \\"when whisky comes near my nose, Whisky Johnny\\". in the midst of their parting drink, Marge, Diane, Christine and Bobbie descend into the hold with Marge announcing that \\"Olga closed up for us ‚Äî for keeps\\", as Christine adds, \\"sure, she's only murdered the guy\\". Burke refuses to get involved, but Clancy says that he'll cut them in if they help with getting the gold. Burke raises his fists for another brawl, but Marge breaks a bottle over his head, knocking him out. Clancy tells the three crewmen to cast off and goes back downstairs as Burke regains consciousness and quickly agrees to include the girls in the deal. The plan, as explained by Clancy, is to arrive at Marana island, where Krogan and Johnny Pacific are running a plantation, and take the gold for themselves, with the six of them sharing half a million each. Diane refuses to participate based on her moral principles, but Olga, who apparently followed them to the boat and hid until now, steps out and announces that \\"I'm cutting myself in for her share\\". Burke says \\"let's put her over the side\\", with Clancy adding \\"good idea\\", but Olga pulls out a gun, stating, \\"I've already shot one man tonight in self-defense, you better play nice with me if you want to get your hands on that gold\\" and, in another quick agreement, Clancy says, \\"all right, we'll cut you in for a share\\". On Krogan's island The boat comes close to Marana island and the arrival is noted through binoculars by Krogan who tells Johnny Pacific that \\"our little game of hide and seek is about to begin\\". They explain to native girl Luana (Veda Ann Borg), who lives with them, that \\"two very much bad men come in that boat, they try to find our gold, where we hide it\\", with Krogan adding, \\"lotta fun is when we take it away from them\\". Clancy, Burke and the five women arrive at Krogan's house, with Marge explaining to Krogan that \\"things got too hot for us at Pango Ango after what happened\\" and asking if he could \\"put us up for a few days until we can make other plans\\". Krogan replies that they've arranged \\"a little party of welcome for tonight\\". As night comes and a full moon shines over the lagoon, Luana leans against a tree and sings, \\"Sleepy Island Moon\\" [by Leo Erdody and June L. Stillman] (accompanied by orchestral music and an unseen chorus of male and female voices) as a man and a woman are seen rhythmically swimming back and forth through the lagoon. At the end of Luana's song, Marge says that \\"this part is beginning to remind me of an old nursery rhyme: mother may I go out to swim? Yes, my darling daughter, hang your clothes on a hickory limb, but don't go near the water.\\" As the girls, Krogan and Johnny Pacific go for a night swim, Clancy kicks Burke, who wanted to swim with Luana, and tells him that \\"now's our chance to frisk the house\\". In the meantime, Krogan and Johnny Pacific, while swimming with the girls, guide them to a view of a spectacular underwater cave, hidden just a few feet beneath the lagoon. Searching the house, Clancy points out to Burke the Tropic Star log, with a map, which indicates that the gold is still underwater on the ship, waiting to be salvaged. As Krogan and the girls come out of the water, Clancy and Burke are lounging on the shore, commenting that they'll be leaving in the morning. In the house, Krogan shows Johnny Pacific the place in log where Clancy tore out the map and says that \\"it didn't take him long to smell out the bait\\", while Johnny Pacific comments that \\"he must be awful dumb to fall for anything as phony as a treasure map\\". The next morning, Marge and Diane visit Clancy and Burke on the boat, as they prepare to look for the gold and Burke tells Clancy that Luana \\"sort of grows on you\\". However, Krogan, Johnny Pacific and Luana are observing the situation from the island, with Krogan commenting that \\"a couple of expert divers like Burke and Clancy oughta do the job in half a dozen trips\\" and as soon as the gold is brought up, \\"five of my best boys will be on the job at dawn\\". On the boat, Clancy again sings \\"Whisky Johnny\\" (\\"now I got a gal, her name is Lize, for she put whisky in her pies\\"), as they examine their air hoses and prepare to take turns in putting on the diving suits and going down with the help of their three crewmen. As Burke descends, accompanied by the sound of Wagnerian choirs, Clancy says, \\"give my regards to Mrs. Jones\\". Burke finds the Tropic Star and, back on the boat, Clancy tell him that \\"the barometer's been dropping steadily all the time you were down, looks like we're in for a blow\\". Meanwhile, on the island, Luana jealously accuses Johnny Pacific of infidelity and their loud quarrel brings Krogan, who calms the situation, but then a native runs in with some disturbing news. The girls grow uneasy and Christine says, \\"yeah, there's something in the air that makes you feel that something's going to happen\\". A native chief (William Edmonds) arrives at the house and tells Krogan, \\"much bad magic now in sky and sea\\", explaining that \\"big wave ready to walk some more\\" and pointing at Rorschach test-like formations of threatening black skies, advises everyone to leave the island. After he departs, Krogan and Johnny Pacific take guns and go off, telling the girls to be careful about tigers which are still occasionally spotted since \\"these islands at one time were a part of Asia\\". Gold, greed and monsoon During his underwater descent, in a diving suit, Clancy's voice is heard on the boat, \\"the agitation of the water will be due to my hearty laughter\\". More loud choral singing (\\"the diver diving down below\\"), accompanied by music, is heard as Clancy walks on the sea bottom . He finds the gold, while, on the island, Krogan and Johnny Pacific are watching through binoculars. Clancy pretends to be in distress so that Burke would bring him up before the gold and, as the trunk full of bullion is aboard and below the deck, Burke gives a few gold bars to the crewmen and tells them to divide it among themselves and then announces to Clancy that he is claiming 60 percent of the loot because he provided the boat and the crew. Clancy protests and they start a violent struggle during which Krogan, Johnny Pacific and their men board the boat, with Krogan pointing his gun and ordering them to \\"stick 'em up\\" and continuing, \\"you guys tried to steal our gold, you're not gonna get away with it\\". Locking them in the boat's back room, Johnny Pacific nails the door shut and tells them \\"I'm building a nice coffin for you guys\\" and adds, \\"so long boys, hope you enjoy your nice dive to Davy Jones' Locker\\". As they board their small launch, Krogan and Johnny Pacific light a fuse to explosives which they attached to Burke's boat. Seconds before the boat explodes, Clancy and Burke manage to kick the door open and jump off into the water. Ominous choirs are heard intoning as the black skies give way to high winds and tall waves. Krogan, Johnny Pacific and the five natives return to the island and walk through the ever-increasing storm, reaching the house as the waves are lapping at its edges. Krogan says, \\"well, any of you gals ever see what three million dollars looks like\\". Olga and Luana excitedly approach the trunk, while Marge, Diane, Christine and Bobbie warily stand back. Krogan continues, \\"there, take a look, isn't that beautiful, three million dollars in gold, think of all the luxuries that'll buy\\". Marge asks what happened to Clancy and Krogan answers that \\"you want to see them, you've got to get yourself a diving suit, because they're down at the bottom of the lagoon, along with the Tropic Star\\". Johnny Pacific tells the four women that \\"you gambled on the wrong team so you get nothing\\". Olga protests that \\"I was playing on your team\\", but he replies that \\"you didn't tell us a thing we didn't know\\" and Krogan adds, \\"we figured Burke and Clancy had enough larceny in their hearts not to put the finger on us\\" and tells Olga, \\"I'll pay your fare to the mainland, if you keep out of my sight, that's more than you deserve\\". Olga then reaches in the back of her sarong, points a gun at Krogan and orders him to \\"start dishing out my share of those sacks\\", but he calmly says, \\"go on and shoot\\" and, as she pulls the trigger, the gun only clicks. Krogan lets out his familiar laugh and tells her, \\"you see, I remembered your fine habit about shooting people, so I had Luana take all the cartridges out of your gun\\" and hits her across the face, making her fall, and then continues, \\"you're all a lot of dirty double-crossing rats, all of you, except Diane, she's the only decent one among you\\". Turning to Johnny Pacific and Luana, he says, \\"and that goes for you too\\", accusing them of planning to double-cross him. Johnny Pacific pulls out his gun and they shoot simultaneously, killing each other. Just then, Clancy enters with Burke, commenting, \\"nice shootin', boys, now that's what I call being pals\\". Luana points a gun at them, but Burke takes it away from her and pulls her towards him, \\"take it easy babe\\". As Clancy proclaims, \\"Marge we're rich\\", the winds hit the thatched house which is then washed away by the surging waves. Clancy and Marge are in the sea as he tries to keep her afloat, but both are swamped by a new surge. Coda An overhead sign marks the entrance to \\"The Bird Cage Cafe\\". Inside, as dance music plays, Marge is seated at the side bar cash register, with what appears to be a large framed photograph of Diane and Burke as a happy couple, propped up against it, while Clancy, wearing a captain's cap and jacket, surveys the place, then sits by her and says, \\"I'll have to put the bite on you for about fifty dollars\\", explaining that he'll tell her more later, adding, \\"you haven't forgotten about that bundle on the Riviera, have you?\\" She gives him the money and rings up \\"NO SALE\\".

The prefecture was established by the Qing dynasty government in 1684, after the island \\"became an integral part of the Chinese Empire\\" in 1683. The Taiwan Prefecture Gazetteer () documented it as part of Fujian Province. The Taiwan Prefecture Gazetteer was completed by Gao Gonggan in 1695, the 34th year of the reign of the Kangxi Emperor. 1684‚Äì1723 When the Qing wrested the island from the control of the Kingdom of Tungning in 1683, Taiwan was made a prefecture under the administration of Fujian Province. The new prefecture consisted of three counties: *Zhuluo County, the central western plains and the north *, around the prefectural seat at Taiwan (now Tainan) *, which took up much of present-day Kaohsiung and Pingtung County The aboriginal lands on the east coastknown to the Qing as the \\"Land Behind the Mountains\\" ()were not controlled at all, although they were vaguely claimed as part of the empire. The seat of government, also known as \\"Taiwan\\" or \\"Taiwanfu\\" (a contraction of , \\"prefectural city of Taiwan\\"), was located in modern-day Tainan, \\"which city had been in turn the capital of the Dutch, Koxinga, and the Chinese\\". 1723‚Äì1875 During this period, Taiwan was administered as three counties and two subprefectures. The counties (, xi√†n) were, from south to north: *Fongshan County: one town, 8 Chinese villages, 73 uncivilized native villages, 8 civilized native villages *Kagi County: one town, 4 Chinese villages, 22 uncivilized native villages, 8 civilized native villages *: one town, 16 villages The subprefectures (, tƒ´ng) were: *Pescadores Subprefecture *Tamsui Subprefecture: one town, 132 farms, 70 native villages 1875‚Äì1887 An administrative change occurred in 1875, when Imperial Commissioner Shen Pao-chen demanded that another prefecture be added in Taiwan to revamp the administrative organization of the northern area of the island. As a result, Taipeh Prefecture was created from part of Taiwan Prefecture. 1887‚Äì1895 Fokien-Taiwan Province was established in 1887, consisting of four prefectures: Taipeh, Taiwan, Tainan, and Taitung. Tainan Prefecture was created from part of Taiwan Prefecture. Thus Taiwan Prefecture was reduced to the area of central Taiwan only, composed of the modern-day Miaoli County, Taichung City, Nantou County, Changhua County, and Yunlin County. The new prefecture was divided into four counties and one subprefecture: , Changhua County, Yunlin County, Miaoli County, and . The new prefecture seat was located at the central city of Toatun (), which was also designated as the site of the new provincial capital, taking its name as Taiwanfu or Taiwan (now Taichung). However, during construction of the new capital, the provincial capital was temporarily relocated to the city of Taipeh (Taipei). One of the administrators of Taiwan Prefecture was Raymund Tu, a native priest of Taiwan. Four years after development of Toatun began, the seat of Taipeh (Taipei) was officially declared the provincial capital. In 1895, with the Treaty of Shimonoseki and the successful Japanese invasion of Taiwan, Taiwan Prefecture was abolished. Under Japanese rule, the province was abolished in favor of Japanese-style divisions.

The park is part of the estate of \\"La Folti√®re\\", where stands the \\"Ch√¢teau de la Folti√®re\\", built in 1847. Ch√¢teau de la Folti√®re The garden of the blue spring  Location  The Botanical garden of Upper Brittany is located on the village of Le Ch√¢tellier (Ille-et-Vilaine), approximately 10 kilometers from the city of Foug√®res, between Rennes and the Mont Saint-Michel, near the A84 motorway.  History  \\"Foltiere\\" is the name of the estate, which means \\"ground where beech trees grow\\", the word \\"fou\\" being ancient french for \\"beech tree\\". The park was created in 1847,Parc floral de Haute-Bretagne site de Tourisme Haute-Bretagne around the Ch√¢teau de la Folti√®re. In 1796 the old manor house was the headquarters of an uprising against the government of the French Republic led by Count Joseph de Puisaye.PARC FLORAL DE HAUTE BRETAGNE (25 ha) site du Comit√© des parcs et jardins de France In 1820, the Estate of \\"La Folti√®re\\" is bought by the family Frontin des Buffards. In 1847, the land surrounding the pond in the park was redesigned as an English romantic landscape garden, with winding paths that follow the terrain, and a view from the lawn in front of the house to the church tower in the village.  The gardens  The Ch√¢teau de la Folti√®re The garden of the rising sun The Poet' valley The garden of the rising sun Bamboo grove The garden of the blue spring The garden of Olympus The secret garden The botanical park is made up of three parts :  The Arcadia Gardens  The first part : Arcadia refers to classical antiquity and the youthfulness of the garden. * The path of white pearls. This pathway is made up of five separate enclosures for which the gardener has composed five maxims. These emphasis the qualities he deems essential in the composition of a garden and where species from the five continents have been planted. * The 1001 nights garden, inspired by Moorish water gardens, is the first garden one comes across on entering the park. A canal with fountains runs through the garden. At the far end are three cypress trees and on either side luxuriant vegetation including jasmine, damask roses and daphnes. Our senses are lulled by the music of running water, the heady perfume and beautiful colours of the exotic flowers. * The city of antiquity evokes a journey around the Mediterranean. An archaeological site is represented by three central quadrants lined on either side by rows of juniper trees, and columns covered with climbing roses complete the scene. The fourth quadrant has retained its original function as a vegetable garden. And like a frieze enhancing a green dominated landscape, flower beds of hardy perennials surround the antique city. * The city of Knossos, backs on to the walls of the city of Antiquity. The labyrinth is composed of a collection of 480 varieties of Camellia. The variety ¬´ sinesis ¬ª or ¬´chinese tea ¬ª flowers from around mid-September. Next comes the ¬´ Camellia Sansanqua ¬ª in early October and then the ¬´ Camellia japonica ¬ª. March is the best time to discover the full range. At the end of the maze a minotaur awaits the children... * Bamboo grove, a maze of bamboos which gives onto a pond planted with lotus (which flower at the end of summer) and in the middle of which are three pyramids covered with miniature bamboos * The secret garden access to which is via an impressive and ornate staircase, is inspired by the humanistic ideal of the Italian Renaissance. It revives the ¬´ Secret Garden ¬ª, vegetal parlour concept inherited from mediaeval tradition. * The ancient rose walk relates the starting story from the first rose bushes known in antiquity down to those at the beginning of the 20th century...Mysterious and complicated hybridizations. A story illustrated by the natural grace of these bushes, the beauty of their flowers and their delicate perfume. * Dionysus' garden. Here one sees a combination of shrubs and perennials. Vines bring a lighter touch to the linear fencing at the entrance to the garden. * Robinson labyrinth, where children love getting lost in a mage of greenery. * The garden of Olympus. Four circles evoke the twelve gods and goddesses of Mount Olympus and the daughters of Zeus: the twelve hours, the nine Muses and the three graces. Opposite Mount Olympus one can see the box which Zeus gave to Pandora. * The prehistoric garden. This garden is an evocation of the flora existent during the Cretaceous era over 100 million years ago and before dinosaurs disappeared. It explains the evolution of plant life.  The Romantic Gardens  The second part represents maturity and plenitude - construction of the manor house and development and perfection of the gardens. Here is a romantic landscape garden where dreams and exotism are part of everyday life. * The garden of the Rising Sun. A gentle combination of mineral, aquatic and vegetal. In this locality, lulled by the music of a waterfall, only abstract beauty counts-that of plants and stones. The trees are works of art, constantly changing form by pruning. Three aspects of traditional Japanese gardens are evoked here:- the walking garden, the zen garden and the tea garden. * Copse \\"Decisif\\". Six yew trees planted two by two to form a triangle. * The garden of exotic fragrances where species from far afield can be found, such as ¬´ richeas ¬ª. * The garden of the blue spring. Set around a pond, this garden is composed solely of blue flowers but with an infinite variety of shades- symbol of eternal love. * The carnivores' den. This marshy area is inhabited by fascinating insect-eating plants. Venus fly- trap and others. * The garden of the four seasons is situated opposite the manor house. There are four flower beds, one for each season. * The modern rose path which is lined with beautiful modern rose bushes.  The Twilight Gardens  The third part offers a timeless composition which represents the development of the garden, old age and twilight of life. * The evening resting place contains a collection of mountain laurel and ¬´ moschata ¬ª roses. A central tetraplyon offers views of the adjacent gardens. * The starry nights garden. This garden is tucked away in the clearing of the ¬´ little wood of confidences ¬ª.Here the plants have black leaves and delicate yellow petals. * The garden of dreams on a summer evening. Three enclosures display collections of agapanthes, crocosmias, echinaceas and peonies planted in small square boxes. * The garden of the April moon. Peonies and shrubs with leaves which flush scarlet in the autumn are to be found in this garden. * The sunset garden, mirror of the north facade of the chateau, this garden benefits from the last rays of light before the sun sets. A curved flower bed contains plants which flower a vivid yellow. * The garden of the old oak tree which is dominated by the presence of a three-hundred-year-old oak tree.  Quality label  The French Ministry of Culture classified the Parc botanique de Haute-Bretagne as a \\"Jardin remarquable\\", Notable gardens of France. The French Ministry of Tourism allotted to the botanical garden the label ¬´ Qualit√© Tourisme ¬ª in 2011.

WITS allows the user to query trade statistics (export, import, re-exports and re- imports) from the UN's repository of official international trade statistics and relevant analytical tables (UN COMTRADE), tariff and non-tariff measures (NTM) data from UNCTAD Trade Analysis and Information System (TRAINS), tariff and bound tariff information from WTO's Integrated Data Base (IDB) for applied tariffs and imports, and from the WTO's Consolidated Tariff Schedules (CTS) database for the bound duties of all WTO Members. WITS also has a module called Global Preferential Trade Agreement (GPTAD) to search and browse Free Trade Agreements (FTA). It also has modules to calculate several trade indicators and perform tariff cut simulation. WITS has multiple sections, including summary trade statistics by country on total exports, imports, export/import partners, top product groups exported/imported, top exporters and importers in the World, derived analytical databases, and a WITS application allowing the user to use the underlying data to generate custom trade statistics and indicators and tariff cut simulations.  Summary Trade Statistics by Country  The trade data for each country is divided into four sections. The first section is the Country Profile Summary and provides summary of the key indicators in Trade, Tariffs, Trade Indicators, Top Export and Import partners of the country and top exported products. The next section is by trading partner and provides the top export or import partners of the country with the trade value, partner share. The final section is by Product Group and this provides details of exports and imports of the country by various standard product groups like by HS Sector, SITC Revision 2 Standard Product Groups or UNCTAD's Stages of processing.  Advanced Analysis  The second section of WITS allows users to perform Advanced Analysis and select their own set of country and country groups, product and product groups, bulk download data, analyze trade competitiveness of countries and perform tariff cut simulation. The trade outcomes module provides a flexible array of options. These options include the selection of countries of interest, product classifications, the usage of reported or mirrored data, and the years of the analysis. In addition, users can also create ad-hoc country and product groups or‚Äîwhen relevant‚Äîinvestigate specific trading partners. It is also possible to generate only a subset of indicators and get comparative data on peer countries. The user's guideline document provides specific details for these options. As an alternative to the indicator by indicator analysis, the software offers a built-in set of choices that the user can automatically employ to generate the set of indicators by section for the country and the year of choice. The output is data for each indicator along with a companion visualization.  Trade indicators  WITS allows the user to calculate and visualize the following Trade Indicators; * Country's Share of World Exports * Share of Product in Total Exports * Share of Market in Total Exports * Hirschman Herfindahl index * Revealed Comparative Advantage Index * Trade Intensity Index * Trade Complementarity Index * Export Diversification (or Concentration) Index * Export Specialization Index * Index of Export Market Penetration * Hummels-Klenow (Products) Intensive Margin * Hummels-Klenow (Products) Extensive Margin * Hummels-Klenow (Markets) Intensive Margin * Hummels-Klenow (Markets) Extensive Margin  Trade Outcomes Indicators  WITS has a Trade Outcomes Indicators module that can be used to review the country- level performance of exports along various dimensions,. The trade outcomes tool follows the analytical framework developed in the World Bank's Trade Competitiveness Diagnostic toolkit. It provides indicators along four different dimensions of trade performance: (i) the composition, orientation, and growth of exports and imports, (ii) the degree of export diversification across products and markets, (iii) the level of sophistication of a country's main exports, and (iv) the survival rate of its export relationships. . The toolkit can be used to assess the competitiveness of a country's overall basket of products as well as specific traded sectors. It facilitates the identification of the primary constraints to improved trade competitiveness and the policy responses to overcome these constraints.  Global Value Chain (GVC) Analysis  WITS has introduced a module for Global Value Chain (GVC) Analysis using the underlying UN Comtrade data on gross exports and imports. The module construct trade indicators related to country's participation in Global Value Chains (GVCs). Using the informed classifications based on Sturgeon and Memedovic (2011) paper. The module allows measuring GVC related performance through: (i) country analysis, (ii) regional analysis, (iii) inter-regional analysis, and analysis of (iv) individual products of interest.

Slope streaks When occurring near the top of a dune, dark sand may cascade down the dune leaving dark surface streaks ‚Äì streaks that might appear at first to be trees standing in front of the lighter regions. A new phenomenon known as slope streaks has been uncovered by the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. These features appear on crater walls and other slopes, and they are thin and many hundreds of metres long. The streaks have been observed to grow slowly over the course of a year or so, always beginning at a point source. Newly formed streaks are dark in colour but fade as they age until white. The cause is unknown, but theories range from dry dust avalanches (the favoured theory) to brine seepage. Examples of dark slope streaks from various parts of Mars are shown below.

Dust devil tracks Many areas on Mars experience the passage of giant dust devils. A thin coating of fine bright dust covers most of the Martian surface. When a dust devil travels by, it blows away the coating and exposes the underlying dark surface. These dust devils have been seen both from the ground and from orbit. They have even blown the dust off the solar panels of the two Rovers on Mars, thereby greatly extending their lives. The twin Rovers were designed to last for 3 months; instead, they have lasted eleven years and are still going. The pattern of the tracks have been shown to change every few months.

A detailed discussion of layering with many Martian examples can be found in Sedimentary Geology of Mars.Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken (eds.). 2012. Sedimentary Geology of Mars. SEPM. Layers can be hardened by the action of groundwater. Martian ground water probably moved hundreds of kilometers, and in the process it dissolved many minerals from the rock it passed through. When ground water surfaces in low areas containing sediments, water evaporates in the thin atmosphere and leaves behind minerals as deposits and/or cementing agents. Consequently, layers of dust could not later easily erode away since they were cemented together. , File:60331 1880mound.jpg|Layered mound on floor of Danielson Crater, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program File:60331 1880layerscolortop2.jpg|Close, color view of layers and dark dust on floor of Danielson Crater, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program File:60331 1880layersclosecolor4boulders.jpg|Close, color view of layers and dark dust on floor of Danielson Crater, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program Boulders are visible in the image.

An erg (or sand sea), made up of aeolian dune fields referred to as the Circumpolar Dune Field surrounds most of the north polar cap. The dunes are covered by a seasonal carbon dioxide frost that forms in early autumn and remains until late spring. Many martian dunes strongly resemble terrestrial dunes but images acquired by the High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter have shown that martian dunes in the north polar region are subject to modification via grainflow triggered by seasonal CO2 sublimation, a process not seen on Earth. Many dunes are black because they are derived from the dark volcanic rock basalt. Extraterrestrial sand seas such as those found on Mars are referred to as \\"undae\\" from the Latin for waves.

They are named for their resemblance to terrestrial gullies. First discovered on images from Mars Global Surveyor, they occur on steep slopes, especially on the walls of craters. Usually, each gully has a dendritic alcove at its head, a fan-shaped apron at its base, and a single thread of incised channel linking the two, giving the whole gully an hourglass shape. They are believed to be relatively young because they have few, if any craters. On the basis of their form, aspects, positions, and location amongst and apparent interaction with features thought to be rich in water ice, many researchers believed that the processes carving the gullies involve liquid water. However, this remains a topic of active research. WikiESP 038231 1410gully.jpg|Gullies with alcove, channel, apron‚Äîthe parts of a complete gully. Picture taken with HiRISE under HiWish program.

Because channels of gullies often form curves, it was thought that they were made by flowing water. Today, it is thought that they could be produced with chunks of dry ice. The image is from HiRISE under HiWish program. Gullies on Dunes Gullies are found on some dunes. These are somewhat different than gullies in other places, like the walls of craters. Gullies on dunes seem to keep the same width for a long distance and often just end with a pit, instead of an apron. They are often just a few meters across with raised banks along the sides.https://scitechdaily.com/linear-gullies-on-mars-caused-by-sliding-dry- ice/Dundas, C., et al. 2012. Seasonal activity and morphological changes in martian gullies. Icarus: 220, 124‚Äì143. Many of these gullies are found on dunes in Russell (Martian crater). In the winter dry ice accumulates on the dunes and then in the spring dark spots appear and dark-toned streaks grow downhill. After the dry ice is gone, new channels are visible. These gullies may be caused by blocks of dry ice moving down the steep slope or perhaps from dry ice starts the sand moving.McEwen, A., et al. 2017. Mars The Pristine Beauty of the Red Planet.

Sometimes the formation appears as a smooth and gently undulating surface; however, in places it is wind-sculpted into ridges and grooves. Radar imaging has suggested that the region may contain either extremely porous rock (for example volcanic ash) or deep layers of glacier-like ice deposits amounting to about the same quantity as is stored in Mars' south polar cap. The lower portion (member) of Medusae Fossae Formation contains many patterns and shapes that are thought to be the remains of streams. It is believed that streams formed valleys that were filled and became resistant to erosion by cementation of minerals or by the gathering of a coarse covering layer. These inverted stream beds are sometimes called sinuous ridges or raised curvilinear features. They may be a kilometer or so in length. Their height ranges from a meter to greater than 10 meters, while the width of the narrow ones is less than 10 meters. The wind has eroded the surface of the formation into a series of linear ridges called yardangs. These ridges generally point in the direction of the prevailing winds that carved them and demonstrate the erosive power of martian winds. The easily eroded nature of the Medusae Fossae Formation suggests that it is composed of weakly cemented particles, and was most likely formed by the deposition of wind-blown dust or volcanic ash. Layers are seen in parts of the formation. A resistant caprock on the top of yardangs has been observed in Viking, Mars Global Surveyor, and HiRISE photos. Very few impact craters are visible throughout the area so the surface is relatively young.Medusae Fossae Formation Mars Odyssey Mission THEMIS File:Medusae Fossae Formation.jpg|Medusae Fossae Formation as seen with Mars Odyssey's THEMIS.

It lies between two different surfaces. The surface of Mars can be divided into two parts: low, young, uncratered plains that cover most of the northern hemisphere, and high-standing, old, heavily cratered areas that cover the southern hemisphere and a small part of the northern hemisphere. Between these two zones is the fretted terrain, containing a complicated mix of cliffs, mesas, buttes, and straight-walled and sinuous canyons. Fretted terrain contains smooth, flat lowlands along with steep cliffs. The scarps or cliffs are usually 1 to 2 km high. Channels in the area have wide, flat floors and steep walls. Fretted terrain is most common in northern Arabia, between latitudes 30¬∞N and 50¬∞N and longitudes 270¬∞W and 360¬∞W. Parts of the fretted terrain are called Deuteronilus Mensae and Protonilus Mensae. In fretted terrain, the land seems to transition from narrow straight valleys to isolated mesas. Most of the mesas are surrounded by forms that have been called a variety of names (circum-mesa aprons, debris aprons, rock glaciers, and lobate debris aprons).http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2000/pdf/1053.pdf At first they appeared to resemble rock glaciers on Earth, but scientists could not be sure. Eventually, proof of their true nature was discovered by radar studies with the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and showed that they contain pure water ice covered with a thin layer of rocks that insulated the ice. In addition to rock covered glaciers around mesas, the region has many steep-walled valleys with lineations‚Äîridges and grooves‚Äîon their floors. The material comprising these valley floors is called lineated valley fill. In some of the best images taken by the Viking Orbiters, some of the valley fill appeared to resemble alpine glaciers on Earth. Given this similarity, some scientists assumed that the lineations on these valley floors might have formed by flow of ice in (and perhaps through) these canyons and valleys. Today, it is generally agreed that glacial flow caused the lineations.

Based on accurate topography measures of height at different points in these craters and calculations of how deep the craters should be based on their diameters, it is thought that the craters are 80% filled with mostly ice.HiRISE Ice Deposition and Loss in an Impact Crater in Utopia Basin (ESP_032569_2225)Garvin, J., S.

Abstract 3096.HiRISE Dissected Mantled Terrain (PSP_002917_2175) Recent modeling suggests that concentric crater fill develops over many cycles in which snow is deposited, then moves into the crater. Once inside the crater, shade and dust preserve the snow. The snow changes to ice. The many concentric lines are created by the many cycles of snow accumulation. Generally snow accumulates whenever the axial tilt reaches 35 degrees.Fastook, J., J. Head. 2014.

The chaotic features may have collapsed when water came out of the surface. Martian outflow channels commonly begin with a Chaos region. A chaotic region can be recognized by a tangle of mesas, buttes, and hills, all chopped through with valleys which in places look almost patterned. Some parts of this chaotic area have not collapsed completely‚Äîthey are still formed into large mesas, so they may still contain water ice. Chaotic terrain occurs in numerous locations on Mars, and always gives the strong impression that something abruptly disturbed the ground. Chaos regions formed long ago. By counting craters (more craters in any given area means an older surface) and by studying the valleys' relations with other geological features, scientists have concluded the channels formed 2.0 to 3.8 billion years ago.

First investigated in the Deuteronilus Mensae region, but it occurs in other places as well. The remnants consist of sets of dipping layers in craters and along mesas.Carr, M. 2001. Sets of dipping layers may be of various sizes and shapes‚Äîsome look like Aztec pyramids from Central America.

This unit also degrades into brain terrain. Brain terrain is a region of maze-like ridges 3‚Äì5 meters high. Some ridges may consist of an ice core, so they may be sources of water for future colonists. 45507 2200brains.jpg|Brain terrain, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program Location is Ismenius Lacus quadrangle. ESP 028336 1395pyramidhellas.jpg|Small, layered structure, as seen by HiRISE under the HiWish program Picture also shows brain terrain forming. Some regions of the upper plains unit display large fractures and troughs with raised rims; such regions are called ribbed upper plains. Fractures are believed to have started with small cracks from stresses. Stress is suggested to initiate the fracture process since ribbed upper plains are common when debris aprons come together or near the edge of debris aprons‚Äîsuch sites would generate compressional stresses. Cracks exposed more surfaces, and consequently more ice in the material sublimates into the planet's thin atmosphere. Eventually, small cracks become large canyons or troughs. Small cracks often contain small pits and chains of pits; these are thought to be from sublimation of ice in the ground.Morgenstern, A., et al. 2007 Large areas of the Martian surface are loaded with ice that is protected by a meters thick layer of dust and other material. However, if cracks appear, a fresh surface will expose ice to the thin atmosphere.Levy, J. et al. 2009. Concentric In a short time, the ice will disappear into the cold, thin atmosphere in a process called sublimation. Dry ice behaves in a similar fashion on the Earth. On Mars sublimation has been observed when the Phoenix lander uncovered chunks of ice that disappeared in a few days.Bright Chunks at Phoenix Lander's Mars Site Must Have Been Ice ‚Äì Official NASA press release (19.06.2008)http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/news/phoenix-20080619.html In addition, HiRISE has seen fresh craters with ice at the bottom. After a time, HiRISE saw the ice deposit disappear. Image:Ice sublimating in the Dodo- Goldilocks trench.gif|Die-sized clumps of bright material in the enlarged \\"Dodo-Goldilocks\\" trench vanished over the course of four days, implying that they were composed of ice which sublimated following exposure. Image:Evaporating ice on Mars Phoenix lander image.jpg|Color versions of the photos showing ice sublimation, with the lower left corner of the trench enlarged in the insets in the upper right of the images. The upper plains unit is thought to have fallen from the sky. It drapes various surfaces, as if it fell evenly. As is the case for other mantle deposits, the upper plains unit has layers, is fine-grained, and is ice-rich. It is widespread; it does not seem to have a point source. The surface appearance of some regions of Mars is due to how this unit has degraded. It is a major cause of the surface appearance of lobate debris aprons. The layering of the upper plains mantling unit and other mantling units are believed to be caused by major changes in the planet's climate. Models predict that the obliquity or tilt of the rotational axis has varied from its present 25 degrees to maybe over 80 degrees over geological time. Periods of high tilt will cause the ice in the polar caps to be redistributed and change the amount of dust in the atmosphere.Head, J. et al. 2003.Madeleine, et al. 2014. Latitude dependent mantle Much of the Martian surface is covered with a thick ice-rich, mantle layer that has fallen from the sky a number of times in the past. In some places a number of layers are visible in the mantle. Esp 037167 1445mantle.jpg|Surface showing appearance with and without mantle covering, as seen by HiRISE, under the HiWish program.

It fell as snow and ice-coated dust. There is good evidence that this mantle is ice-rich. The shapes of the polygons common on many surfaces suggest ice-rich soil. High levels of hydrogen (probably from water) have been found with Mars Odyssey.Mitrofanov, I. et al. 2007a. Burial depth of water ice in Mars permafrost subsurface. In: LPSC 38, Abstract #3108. Houston, TX. Thermal measurements from orbit suggest ice. The Phoenix Lander found water ice directly since it landed in a field of polygons and its landing rockets exposed a pure ice surface. Theory had predicted that ice would be found under a few cm of soil. This mantle layer is called \\"latitude dependent mantle\\" because its occurrence is related to the latitude. It is this mantle that cracks and then forms polygonal ground. This cracking of ice-rich ground is predicted based on physical processes. Washburn, A. 1973. Periglacial Processes and Environments. St. Martin‚Äôs Press, New York, pp. 1‚Äì2, 100‚Äì147. , Polygonal patterned ground Polygonal, patterned ground is quite common in some regions of Mars.Refubium - Suche It is commonly believed to be caused by the sublimation of ice from the ground. Sublimation is the direct change of solid ice to a gas. This is similar to what happens to dry ice on the Earth. Places on Mars that display polygonal ground may indicate where future colonists can find water ice. Patterned ground forms in a mantle layer, called latitude dependent mantle, that fell from the sky when the climate was different.Kreslavsky, M.A., Head, J.W., 2002.

ESP 045299 1545coloredclose.jpg|Color image of patterned ground, enlarged from a previous image, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program , Scalloped topography Scalloped topography is common in the mid-latitudes of Mars, between 45¬∞ and 60¬∞ north and south. It is particularly prominent in the region of Utopia Planitia in the northern hemisphere and in the region of Peneus and Amphitrites Patera in the southern hemisphere. Such topography consists of shallow, rimless depressions with scalloped edges, commonly referred to as \\"scalloped depressions\\" or simply \\"scallops\\". Scalloped depressions can be isolated or clustered and sometimes seem to coalesce. A typical scalloped depression displays a gentle equator- facing slope and a steeper pole-facing scarp. This topographic asymmetry is probably due to differences in insolation. Scalloped depressions are believed to form from the removal of subsurface material, possibly interstitial ice, by sublimation. This process may still be happening at present.http://hiroc.lpl.arizona.edu/images/PSP?diafotizo.php?ID=PSP_002296_1215 On November 22, 2016, NASA reported finding a large amount of underground ice in the Utopia Planitia region of Mars.Huge Underground Ice Deposit on Mars Is Bigger Than New Mexico Space The volume of water detected has been estimated to be equivalent to the volume of water in Lake Superior. The volume of water ice in the region were based on measurements from the ground-penetrating radar instrument on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, called SHARAD. From the data obtained from SHARAD, ‚Äúdielectric permittivity‚Äù, or the dielectric constant was determined. The dielectric constant value was consistent with a large concentration of water ice.Bramson, A, et al. 2015. Widespread excess ice in Arcadia Planitia, Mars.

Image:Pedestal crater3.jpg|Pedestal craters form when the ejecta from impacts protect the underlying material from erosion. As a result of this process, craters appear perched above their surroundings. Image:Pedestaldrawingcolor2.jpg|Drawing shows a later idea of how some pedestal craters form. In this way of thinking, an impacting projectile goes into an ice-rich layer‚Äîbut no further. Heat and wind from the impact hardens the surface against erosion. This hardening can be accomplished by the melting of ice which produces a salt/mineral solution thereby cementing the surface.

Brain terrain Brain terrain is a feature of the Martian surface, consisting of complex ridges found on lobate debris aprons, lineated valley fill and concentric crater fill. It is so named because it suggests the ridges on the surface of the human brain. Wide ridges are called closed-cell brain terrain, and the less common narrow ridges are called open-cell brain terrain. It is thought that the wide closed-cell terrain contains a core of ice, and when the ice disappears the center of the wide ridge collapses to produce the narrow ridges of the open-cell brain terrain.

Rootless Cones Rootless cones are caused by explosions of lava with ground ice under the flow. The ice melts and turns into a vapor that expands in an explosion that produces a cone or ring. Features like these are found in Iceland, when lavas cover water-saturated substrates.S. Fagents, A., P. Lanagan, R. Greeley. 2002.

Planet Science: 41, 1675‚Äì1690. Ridges often appear as mostly straight segments that intersect in a lattice-like manner. They are hundreds of meters long, tens of meters high, and several meters wide. It is thought that impacts created fractures in the surface, these fractures later acted as channels for fluids. Fluids cemented the structures. With the passage of time, surrounding material was eroded away, thereby leaving hard ridges behind. Since the ridges occur in locations with clay, these formations could serve as a marker for clay which requires water for its formation.Mustard et al., 2007.

What seems to happen it that much ice melts, the water goes away, and then the surface cracks and collapses. These exhibit concentric fractures and large pieces of ground that seemed to have been pulled apart. Sites like this may have recently had held liquid water, hence they may be fruitful places to search for evidence of life.Levy, J., et al. 2017.

Also, in some places dust is blown out of in geyser-like eruptions that are sometimes called \\"spiders.\\" If a wind is blowing, the material creates a long, dark streak or fan. During the winter, much frost accumulates. It freezes out directly onto the surface of the permanent polar cap, which is made of water ice covered with layers of dust and sand. The deposit begins as a layer of dusty CO2 frost. Over the winter, it recrystallizes and becomes denser. The dust and sand particles caught in the frost slowly sink. By the time temperatures rise in the spring, the frost layer has become a slab of semi-transparent ice about 3 feet thick, lying on a substrate of dark sand and dust. This dark material absorbs light and causes the ice to sublimate (turn directly into a gas). Eventually much gas accumulates and becomes pressurized. When it finds a weak spot, the gas escapes and blows out the dust. Speeds can reach 100 miles per hour.Gas jets spawn dark 'spiders' and spots on Mars icecap Mars Odyssey Mission THEMIS Dark channels can sometimes be seen; they are called \\"spiders.\\"Benson, M. 2012.

In 1843 he started his career as an interne in pharmacy. From 1857 to 1897 he held the chair of Physique v√©g√©tale at the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle in Paris. He is known for his research involving the absorption of nitrogen by plants. In 1849-1852 he carried out experiments on nitrogen absorption from the air by plants that reasserted 18th century theories espoused by Joseph Priestley and Jan Ingenhousz, stating that plants were capable of absorbing free nitrogen, a claim that was later opposed by Nicolas-Th√©odore de Saussure in 1804 and backed up by the experiments of Jean Senebier (1742-1809). The subject garnered enough interest in the scientific community that the French Academy of Sciences formed a committee to investigate Ville's work, resulting in a confirmation of his experiments on the matter.

These six sites are located along a 12 km section of the River Clyde and its tributaries, and lie close to built-up areas such as Hamilton and Lanark on the southern outskirts of Greater Glasgow. The sites can be easily accessed by about two million people living in the surrounding urban areas, making the reserve unique amongst Scotland's NNRs, most of which tend to be located in more remote areas.The Story of Clyde Valley Woodlands National Nature Reserve. pp. i-ii (foreword). The six sites are:The Story of Clyde Valley Woodlands National Nature Reserve. p. 1. *Cartland Craigs - managed by NatureScot *Cleghorn Glen - managed by NatureScot *Falls of Clyde- managed by the Scottish Wildlife Trust (SWT) *Hamilton High Parks at Chatelherault - managed by South Lanarkshire Council (SLC) *Mauldslie Woods - managed by SLC *Nethan Gorge - managed by SWT The woodlands are located in steep-sided river gorges and contain outstanding examples of the ancient, semi-natural, deciduous woodland which would once have covered much of the Central Belt. Plant species found on the floor of the woodlands include bluebells, wild garlic, wood anemone and wood sorrel. The woodlands are also home to an unusual array of invertebrates including various species of beetles, hoverflies and caddisflies. Larger creatures include badgers and breeding peregrine falcons. At the Falls of Clyde in particular there are endangered peregrine falcons and rare tundra plant life that has survived on a cliff face since the last Ice Age. The reserve was first established in 1981, when Cleghorn Glen was declared a National Nature Reserve. In 1987 Cartland Craigs was declared part of the reserve, which was renamed as the Clyde Valley Woodlands National Nature Reserve. In 2007 four additional sites (Chatelherault, the Falls of Clyde, Mauldslie Woods and Nethan Gorge) were declared parts of the Clyde Valley Woodlands National Nature Reserve. Other conservation designations Five of the six sites are designated Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), although the boundaries of each SSSI generally differ from those of the NNR. Mauldslie Woods near Carluke is not an SSSI, and has no other official designation. It was added to the NNR as an experimental addition, with the site being to used to demonstrate methods of woodland management that promote biodiversity.The Story of Clyde Valley Woodlands National Nature Reserve. p. 15. The reserve is classified as a Category II protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. There is also a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) entitled Clyde Valley Woods, which covers 437 ha (1.7 sq mi) of land and partly overlaps with the NNR.The Story of Clyde Valley Woodlands National Nature Reserve. p. 24. Sites Six sites make up the Clyde Valley Woodlands National Nature Reserve. Cartland Craigs and Cleghorn Glen Cartland Craigs and Cleghorn Glen are two distinct sections of the Clyde Valley Woodlands NNR managed by NatureScot. Cleghorn Glen was designated as a National Nature Reserve in 1981 and Cartland Craigs was added in 1987. These two woodlands are located in deep gorges along a 4 km long section of Mouse Water. The main tree species on the lower slopes of the gorges are ash, elm, sycamore and hazel, with alder in the wetter areas. The higher parts of the woodlands have a more acidic soil, and are home to species such as oak, birch, hazel, Scots pine and occasional stands of aspen. The woodlands are considered representative of a type of habitat known as lime-sycamore forest; however Scotland is too far north for lime, and so their place is taken by elms. Many of the elm, hazel and oak trees at the northern edge of Cleghorn Glen were coppiced between the early 19th and mid-20th centuries to provide wood for a variety of purposes including charcoal, pit props and products such as clogs and bobbins for the cotton mills at New Lanark.The Story of Clyde Valley Woodlands National Nature Reserve. p. 11. Over 210 species of flowering plants have been recorded at the two sites, including less-common species such alternate-leaved golden saxifrage, wood fescue, yellow star of Bethlehem, globe flower, Dutch rush and herb paris.The Story of Clyde Valley Woodlands National Nature Reserve. p. 6.The Story of Clyde Valley Woodlands National Nature Reserve. p. 7. The woodlands are ideal for badgers, who build their setts on the slopes of the gorges and forage for food in the surrounding fields. Other mammals found include brown hares, pipistrelle bats, and otter. Of the birds present, the most notable are the spotted flycatcher, bullfinch and song thrush, all of which are identified as priority species in the United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan.The Story of Clyde Valley Woodlands National Nature Reserve. p. 8. Jerviswood, on the edge of Cleghorn Glen, features in the Lanark Lanimers celebrations, as birks (birch twigs) from here are carried as part of the procession. This came about due to a dispute in 1840, in which townspeople were accused of damaging birch trees planted by the owner of the wood. Further investigations found that the land did not in fact belong to the purported owner, and so birks gathered from Jerviswood are carried to emphasise the town's right to march over this land.The Story of Clyde Valley Woodlands National Nature Reserve. p. 10. Falls of Clyde The natural amphitheatre at the base of Corra Linn (shown) is home to rare tundra plant-life.The Falls of Clyde are a collection of four waterfalls along the river Clyde, near the villages of New Lanark and Stonebyres. Only the three falls near New Lanark (Bonnington Linn, Corra Linn and Dundaff Linn) are included in the Falls of Clyde site of special scientific interest; the other, Stonebyres Linn, is about 2 miles (3 km) further downstream. Scottish Wildlife Trust, a charitable organisation, manages the Falls of Clyde site, focusing on the preservation of the endangered or protected wildlife in the grounds, such as peregrine falcons, roe deer and badgers. Much interesting, protected and rare plant life can be found on the site, such as fields of heather, rowan, and bluebells; the slopes of the natural amphitheatre beneath Corra Linn are home to a rare tundra plant life which has survived since the last ice age. There is also a great variety of native woodland on the site. Much of Scotland's native woodland has been destroyed or replaced with exotic trees by human activity. Within the Falls of Clyde site there is an abundance of architecture, including Bonnington Pavilion, an 18th-century house of mirrors, an iron footbridge, and the 15th-century Corra Castle, all of which are in ruins. Hamilton High Parks Hamilton High Parks forms part of the Chatelherault estate, which is managed by South Lanarkshire Council. Part of the site is classified as a SSSI, although the NNR extends further to include most of the land along the Avon Water and Meikle Glen within the estate. The main tree species at Hamilton High Parks are ash and elm, with areas of oak, birch and alder also present. The parkland oaks known as the Cadzow oaks are home to a number of rare types of beetle, including the hairy fungus beetle, which is not thought to be found anywhere else in Scotland. Mauldslie Woods Mauldslie Woods lies west of Carluke, and is the only part of the NNR to have no other official designation. It is north of the Clyde, and has shallower slopes than the other sites in the Reserve. As a result, by the 1800s the woodland here had been cleared and replanted, including one section which was planted as orchard for apples, pears and plums. Since 2007 Mauldslie Woods has formed part of the NNR, and is now being actively managed to restore the native woodland. The aim is to use the site to demonstrate methods of woodland management that promote biodiversity alongside sustainable timber extraction. Nethan Gorge The Nethan Gorge portion of the NNR consists of two sites on the River Nethan that are managed by the Scottish Wildlife Trust. A path links the two reserves, following a route past Craignethan Castle. Upper Nethan Gorge, located near the village of Blackwood, contains an area of ancient woodland, in which ash and elm woodland grows on steep slopes above the River Nethan. The lower, wetter parts of the woodland host alderwoods, which are not common in South Lanarkshire. Plants such as broadleaved helleborine, wood melick and meadow saxifrage, all of which are locally uncommon, can be seen. Bird species present include great spotted woodpeckers and buzzards. Lower Nethan Gorge, located near the village of Crossford, is a semi-natural woodland consisting chiefly of elm, ash and oak trees. The site is particularly noted for a number of uncommon beetles including the nationally scarce species Cerylon fagi, Tetratoma ancora and Ptinomorphus imperialis. Other notable animals found here include green woodpeckers, otters and badgers.

The band consists of Hot Chip members Al Doyle, Felix Martin plus composer Tom Hopkins. Their first album Yesterday Was Lived and Lost was released in the UK on 5 March 2012 (and in the United States on 3 April 2012). Their second album Pour It On was released by Sunday Best Recordings, worldwide on 20 October 2014. First single \\"The Sunlight\\" was premiered by Pitchfork on 21 August. Both New Build albums have been mixed and finished at Club Ralph, the studio of Mark Ralph (Clean Bandit, Franz Ferdinand, Hot Chip) in north London, and Pour It On was mastered by Mike Marsh at the Exchange. Early on New Build received national radio play on the BBC by DJs including Mary Anne Hobbes, Nick Grimshaw, Rob Da Bank and Peter Serafinowicz, featured in worldwide publications such as Rolling Stone magazine, Mixmag and The Guardian and prior to releasing their first album released two singles on their own label Lanark Recordings, the first entitled \\"Misery Loves Company\\", the second \\"Do You Not Feel Loved?\\"‚Ä¶.  History   Formation and Yesterday Was Lived and Lost  New Build formed in 2010, although core members Felix Martin and Al Doyle had previously worked together since meeting in 2001. Working and touring together as members of the British electronic music band Hot Chip, Doyle and Martin began to record songs at their own studio, Lanark Studios, in London in 2007. One of these early recordings, \\"The Stone That The Builder Rejected\\", was subsequently featured under the artist name \\"Lanark\\" on the Hot Chip entry of the \\"DJ Kicks\\" compilation series. Doyle and Martin where subsequently joined by Tom Hopkins, an electronic composer who began working as an engineer at Lanark Studios in 2009, as Hot Chip began work there recording part of their album One Life Stand. The trio began writing and recording original compositions together around this time, collaborating with Pat Mahoney from the New York based band LCD Soundsystem on the track \\"Guitar Man\\" and with Bolton-born producer and vocalist Janine Rostron (Planningtorock) on several other tracks. In September 2011, New Build released their first public track, a free download entitled \\"Finding Reasons\\". The trio subsequently established their own independent record label Lanark Recordings. Their first release was a vinyl only 12\\" single featuring the tracks \\"Misery Loves Company\\", \\"Guitar Man\\" and a remix of \\"Finding Reasons\\" by Janine Rostron. Their second release is another 12\\" entitled \\"Do You Not Feel Loved?\\", made public in January 2012.

The band undertook their first headline tour in March 2012 to mark the release of their first album Including sold out shows in UK, Europe and New York, plus a trip to SXSW festival in Austin. In April 2013 armed with the one off single \\"False Thing\\" the band headlined the Britweek Festival in Los Angeles and subsequently toured the West Coast of USA. Amusingly this Los Angeles showcase was gatecrashed by The Rolling Stones stealing the venue that was booked, as reported in the LA Times and other significant media.  Pour It On  In August 2014 the band announced the intent to release their 2nd album internationally on Sunday Best Recordings, and revealed new song \\"The Sunlight\\" with a video directed by friends Sam Lawlor and Lindsey Pollock, premiered on Pitchfork Media. The release date of the album is 20 October and its available for preorder at all good digital stores with \\"The Sunlight\\" as an instant grat track. The song has been played on BBC Radio One by Huw Stepehens, on BBC 6 Music by Lauren Laverne, on XFM by John Kennedy, and others.

The home is operated and funded by the state of Arizona. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History In the early 20th century, the idea for a retirement home in the Arizona Territory originated with three prominent Arizonans: Major A. J. Doran, a judge and territorial representative; rancher Johnny Duke; and businessman Frank M. Murphy, the brother of former Arizona territorial governor Oakes Murphy. They thought that Arizona should provide a rest home for aging settlers who moved to Arizona to help establish the area. Doran sponsored a bill to fund the idea, presented to the 24th Arizona Territorial Legislature in 1907, but it was not passed. Journalist Sharlot Hall handled clerical duties regarding the bill. Submitted again in 1909, both houses of the legislature passed the bill, and Territorial Governor Joseph Henry Kibbey signed the bill into law on March 11, 1909. Sited on a prominent granite hill overlooking Prescott's town square, Murphy put up of his land for the building. Judge T.G. Norris later donated adjacent land for expansion. To design the building, a female architect was selected: W.S. Elliott of Prescott, who had come to prominence for her work on St. Joseph's Academy. The three-story retirement home, built of brick with wooden porticos, was completed at a cost of $25,000. Doors opened on February 1, 1911, with Doran as supervisor. Doran presided for the first year, during which time Arizona became a state. When first built, the rest home could hold 40 men. It was open to destitute men who were at least 60 years old and who had been living in Arizona for 25 years. In 1916, a private endowment provided for expansion with a women's wing added to house 20 women. The building was opened to disabled miners in 1927. Big Nose Kate, born Mary Katherine Horony, was admitted to the home in 1931 after six months of applications, finally appealing successfully to her longtime friend, governor George W. P. Hunt. Kate, once the common-law wife of Doc Holliday and later the wife of blacksmith George M. Cummings for only a year, had first gained notoriety as the madam of a brothel. She stayed at the rest home until her death in 1940 at the age of 89. In 1947, Life magazine featured the home and its residents in a colorful story titled, \\"Old Pioneers' Home: Retired to state home, oldsters spit, cuss and fight with canes\\". Devoted primarily to a description of the quirky characters living there, the article said that the state-sponsored rest home was the only one in the U.S., not counting one in the Territory of Alaska built to house aging Klondike Gold Rushers. Superintendent Jack Sills said that applicants were required to have lived in Arizona for 35 years, and that residents were given $7.50 each month to spend as they wished, usually on alcohol and tobacco. The Life article was described in detail in 1974 in a writeup published in The Prescott Courier in which reporter Claudette Simpson said that Life angered some locals for its crudely humorous portrayal of idiosyncratic and cantankerous residents, the humor delivered at the expense of Prescott's dignity. In 2010, Superintendent Ted Ihrman said that the Life piece had added \\"some historical significance to the home.\\" Today Front entrance in 2012 The expanded complex of buildings can hold 155 residents, and was at 71% capacity in October 2010. Its operating expenses are provided mainly by about $5 million each year from the state, and by some residents who pay a portion of their own care. Applicants must have lived in Arizona for 50 years. In 2011, the retirement home celebrated its 100th anniversary with tours and open-house events.

During the Second World War, he commanded No. 80 Squadron in the New Guinea campaign (for which he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross) and then No. 80 Wing in the Borneo campaign. He commanded No. 78 Wing during the Malayan Emergency, earning the Air Force Cross for his leadership. Following his retirement from the RAAF in 1970, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. Early life Born on 20 November 1915 in Glenferrie, Melbourne, Cooper was the son of a butcher and was educated at state schools in Melbourne. After finishing his education at Melbourne High School, he entered the workforce as a manchester salesman. Military career At the age of 19, Cooper enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Initially he was an aircraft hand, and then a clerk and bandsman (having learned the trumpet in his childhood). Still an enlisted man, he began flight training in 1936. He graduated as a sergeant upon completion of his training in December and was initially posted to No. 1 Squadron. By mid 1937, he was a flight instructor at No. 1 Flying Training School. He was commissioned in June 1939 but two months later resigned from the air force. Having recently become married to Doreen May Freeland, he and his new wife moved to Adelaide, where he took up an instructor position at an aero club. Second World War \\"Coopers Flying Circus\\": Squadron Leader Cooper (middle) with members of No. 80 Squadron in New Guinea, July 1944 In 1940 Cooper was recalled from the Citizen Air Force (the RAAF reserve) and promoted to flying officer. Engaged in instructor duties throughout 1941, in July 1942 he undertook fighter pilot training and was posted in quick succession to No. 23, 83 and 86 squadrons to gain operational experience. In September 1943, he took command of No. 80 Squadron, which was then operating Kittyhawks. The squadron supported units of the Australian Army during the New Guinea Campaign, and Cooper, having been made temporary squadron leader on being put in command of the squadron, was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross in 1944. In July 1944, Cooper returned to Australia and once again took up instructor duties, this time at No. 2 Operational Training Unit. In January 1945, he was temporarily promoted to wing commander and tasked to take over No. 80 Wing, then based in Morotai (an island in the Dutch East Indies), from Group Captain Clive Caldwell. No. 80 Wing, operating Spitfires, was then training for the forthcoming invasion of Borneo, and once the invasion began, supported the Borneo campaign. Cooper remained in command of No. 80 Wing until the end of the war. In September 1945, Cooper was put in command of No. 81 Wing, which was tasked with occupation duties in Japan. He returned to Australia in 1947, having been promoted to acting group captain at the time of taking over No. 81 Wing. Postwar career Granted a permanent commission as an acting wing commander in September 1948, Cooper held several postwar commands, including No. 1 Flying Training School from 1949 to 1950, No. 21 Squadron from 1950 to 1952, and North-Western Area Command from 1952 to 1954. Raised to group captain in 1957, he was commander of No. 78 Wing from 1957 to 1960. No. 78 Wing was then operating Sabres from RAAF Butterworth Base in Malaya during the Malayan Emergency, and Cooper was awarded the Air Force Cross for his leadership. He also undertook diplomatic duties, serving as air attach√© in Paris from 1963 to 1966, and helped with the integration of the Mirage fighter jet into Australian service. Promoted to acting air commodore in 1966 (made permanent in 1968), Cooper retired from the Royal Australian Air Force in 1970 having spent his final years as commander of RAAF Base Williamtown. Later life Cooper was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire shortly after his retirement and died of cancer on 6 April 1986. He was survived by his wife and two children.

The primary targets are butanol, biodiesel, and hydrogen, but include other alcohols and carbon- containing gasses such as methane and butane. A primary source of funding for research on liquid electrofuels for transportation is the Electrofuels Program of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), headed by Eric Toone. ARPA-E, created in 2009 under President Obama‚Äôs Secretary of Energy Steven Chu, is the Department of Energy‚Äôs (DOE) attempt to duplicate the effectiveness of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA. Examples of projects funded under this program include OPX Biotechnologies‚Äô biodiesel effort led by Michael Lynch and Derek Lovley‚Äôs work on microbial electrosynthesis at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, which reportedly produced the first liquid electrofuel using CO2 as the feedstock. Descriptions of all ARPA-E Electrofuels Program research projects can be found at the ARPA-E Electrofuels Program website. The first Electrofuels Conference, sponsored by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers was held in Providence, RI in November 2011. At that conference, Director Eric Toone stated that \\"Eighteen months into the program, we know it works. We need to know if we can make it matter.\\" Several groups are beyond proof-of-principle, and are working to scale up cost-effectively. Electrofuels have the potential to be disruptive if carbon-neutral electrofuels can be cheaper than petroleum fuels, and chemical feedstocks produced by electrosynthesis cheaper than those refined from crude oil. Electrofuels also have a great potential to alter the renewable energy landscape, as electrofuels allow renewables from all sources to be stored conveniently as a liquid fuel. , prompted by the fracking boom, ARPA-E's focus has moved from electrical feedstocks to natural-gas based feedstocks, and thus away from electrofuels.

Block (February 20, 1912 ‚Äì November 8, 2011) was an American artist. Born in Louisville, Kentucky, Block studied art in Cincinnati, Ohio, and exhibited sculpture at her first national show at the Chicago Art Institute in 1941. Her graduation from John Herron School of Art in 1960, at age 48, marked a return to creative work. Her superb color sense has always been Amanda's trademark. Bright, sensual, engaging, full of movement, her work draws the viewer into its orbit, forcing questions upon us. Her female subjects, no matter how abstract their portrayal, always seem to be real people; and we, the viewer, feel forced to question: who are they, and why do they speak so clearly to us.Amanda Block's Head 2 The figural work of Block, her most accessible, falls between the traditional and the avant-garde, between simple and subtle, between passion and control. Although she became well known for her large abstract landscapes in acrylic and her decorative, colorful lithographs from the middle and late 1970s; ultimately, it is through the figural work that one may truly understand this complex artist. A lover of beauty, it is the female form that most stimulated Block's sensibilities. Her women are strength itself, often veering toward fierce, frank and open, but always sensual. History Head Block always knew she was an artist, but life kept getting in her way. Born into a prominent and illustrious Jewish family, Block attended Smith College, but dropped out to marry in 1931. She soon began attending classes at the Art Academy of Cincinnati, Ohio, and exhibited for the first time, sculpture, at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1941. Then, World War II intervened, and Block found herself in Ft. Sill, Oklahoma, for the duration of the war. There, her only child, JG Wolf, was born. Child- rearing and divorce occupied her until she was able to return to art school during the middle and late fifties. Her real work began in 1960 upon graduation from John Herron Art School in Indianapolis, Indiana, where she lived with her second husband, Maurice Block Jr., a successful department store executive, who eventually became the President of the William H Block department stores. From 1960 until 1984 she produced hundreds of prints, paintings, drawings, and mixed media images, at which point she retired from active production. Many, many shows, numerous purchases by museums and private collectors, and acceptance at the highest levels validated her career. Additionally during this time, she taught drawing and lithography at John Herron, where she was thought to be a gifted and talented instructor. Her work only seems to improve with aging, becoming more accessible, and more appreciated as her unique sensibilities come more in line with today's. Paintings Block's large, abstract expressionist paintings were the cornerstone of her success in the late sixties and seventies. These large paintings sold very well at the time and adorned the walls of a large number of buildings and institutions of the day. Traditionally abstract expressionist and very much in the mainstream of painting at the time, these large canvasses today have the effect of anchoring the viewer firmly in the times. Spending several weeks each winter in Tucson, Arizona, with her husband, Maurice Block Jr., Amanda grew to love the desert landscapes and strong visual attributes of the area. The desert and its impact upon her became a common theme. She often did rough watercolors there, trying to capture the feeling and color palette of the unique place. Unfortunately, these studies do not survive, but their impact clearly inform her large abstract landscapes. Amanda's color sense and strong design also contribute to their effectiveness. Evoking the sensibilities associated with geography writ large, mountains and seas, lakes, rivers, forests, and always the desert were the subjects of her broadly realized art. Figural and landscape lithography Amana Block, Figure A lithographer of some renown ‚Äì Block taught stone lithography at John Herron for a number of years‚Äîthe artist felt very comfortable in the complex and demanding medium of printmaking. Her press was for two decades the only private lithograph press in the state of Indiana, donated to John Herron for her students upon her retirement. Eschewing the often blocky and repetitive style of her contemporaries, not interested in the facile or geometrical designs running through the art of the day, Block's prints fall vaguely into two categories. Figural art and landscape art, the two most common themes throughout all her work. Of the two, the figural pieces sing most loudly to us today. A lover of beauty, it is the female form that most stimulated Amanda's sensibilities. Broad swaths of color force the viewer to confront the subject on her own terms. These are real women, with real feelings. Block's editions are small, seldom more that a dozen prints per edition. Often however, each print required a dozen or more printings to layer the colors one upon the other, finally realizing the image Amanda required. Her washes are finely controlled and the juxtaposition between wash and line builds a tension that adds a third dimension to the effect. Drawings and watercolors Amanda Block, 2 Block believed that drawing was the most important of the artist's tools. As a drawing instructor at John Herron she always remained true to traditional principles and classic approaches to realizing the subject. Her subject, the one with which she most surely resonated, was the female form, and through it the vision and sensuality of the woman. Block drew from life every week of her working career; and these drawings, originally intended to be studies and practice works, eventually became finished works in themselves. As her color sense and courage expanded she began laying broad swaths of color on her drawings. The results are definitive and unique, colorful and unabashedly sensual, in some cases verging toward erotic.

He made his professional debut in 2011 after a successful college career in sumo. He currently holds the record for the most consecutive wins since entering professional sumo, and for the fastest rise to the top makuuchi division from the lowest jonokuchi division. His highest rank has been komusubi, which he reached in September 2014. However, because of injuries he has fell down the rankings, reaching a low of sandanme 23 in November 2016. Early life and sumo background He participated in amateur sumo while in high school in Saitama prefecture, and in his third year there, won the junior sumo championship in the free weight category. He later entered Nihon University and in his second year, in 2008, he achieved the status of student yokozuna in the national student sumo tournament. This success would have allowed him to enter professional sumo at a higher rank (known as makushita tsukedashi) but he chose to give priority to graduating, and passed up this chance. Career Early career Upon graduating he joined Kitanoumi stable, adopting the shikona of to distinguish himself from an active wrestler who already had the surname Sakuma. Before even entering the ring he was making a name for himself because of his diligence, skill, and strength in practice. He was allowed to practice regularly with higher ranked wrestlers almost from the beginning because of this. He won his first tournament championship or y≈´sh≈ç in the jonokuchi division with a perfect record and a playoff win against stablemate and fellow rising star . In the following September tournament he won all his regular matches, but lost a playoff match for the jonidan championship. Playoffs are not calculated in professional sumo records, therefore his consecutive record was left intact. He continued his streak in the November tournament, with a perfect record and a playoff win. In the first tournament of 2012, he continued undefeated and on the 11th day of the tournament, reached 27 consecutive wins from his entry into sumo, surpassing the previous record set by former komusubi Itai in 1979. In his next match, on the 13th day, he finally lost to an overarm throw, by . Nevertheless, on the final day of the tournament he came through a four-way playoff to win the championship. This was his fourth consecutive playoff, a record. His calmness in the ring, and unaffected humbleness about his success at this stage was noted by commentators. Though he logged two losses for the first time in his first upper makushita tournament in March 2012, his five wins was enough to earn him promotion to j≈´ry≈ç in the following May tournament. The six tournaments it took him to reach sekitori status from maezumo is level with Itai and Tosayutaka for the fastest ever. On the occasion of his promotion, he changed his shikona surname to J≈çk≈çry≈´. It was also announced that he would be moving to the re‚Äìestablished Kise stable, which was founded by the former Higonoumi but forced to merge with Kitanoumi stable in 2010. Makuuchi career J≈çk≈çry≈´'s first tournament as a sekitori was a success, with him securing his kachi-koshi or majority of wins on the final day with a win over . After a 10‚Äì5 score in July, he won promotion to the makuuchi division by clinching the j≈´ry≈ç championship in September with a playoff win over Ikioi. His makuuchi debut in November 2012 was just nine tournaments after his professional debut, beating the previous record of eleven held by Koto≈çsh≈´ and Aran. He found the going more tough in the top division and recorded his first ever make-koshi, finishing on 6‚Äì9 and suffering immediate demotion back to j≈´ry≈ç. However he made a quick return to makuuchi after finishing runner‚Äìup in January to Takanoiwa on 11‚Äì4. Afterwards he largely alternated between winning and losing tournaments, and fell to j≈´ry≈ç again in January 2013. For the remainder of 2013 he managed to stay in the top division, but was again relegated to the second division in January of the following year, but bounced back in one tournament just as he had in the previous year. In the following two tournaments of March and May 2014 he logged two consecutive winning tournaments in the top division, a feat he couldn't accomplish in the previous year. In the July 2014 tournament he had his best finish in the top division at 10‚Äì5, which earned him promotion to the san'yaku ranks for the first time at komusubi for September. He could manage only four wins in his san'yaku debut and dropped back to the maegashira ranks. In January 2015 he suffered an injury to his right knee in a bout against End≈ç but continued to fight and picked up his first kinboshi or gold star for the defeat of a yokozuna, upsetting Harumafuji on Day 7. J≈çk≈çry≈´ dedicated the win to his son, as it was his birthday. Injuries and demotions J≈çk≈çry≈´ withdrew on Day 12 of the January 2015 tournament and with only five wins against ten losses in each of his next two tournaments, he was relegated back to j≈´ry≈ç. His 8‚Äì7 record in September was his first majority of wins at any tournament in 2015. Although he returned to the top division in January 2016 he was not fully healed and he was forced to withdraw after only two wins because of ligament damage to the same knee that he had injured a year earlier. After two consecutive losing scores in the j≈´ry≈ç division he was demoted to makushita for the July 2016 tournament. After undergoing surgery he was forced to miss both the July and September tournaments, and fell to sandanme 23. He predictably won the division on his comeback in November, going unbeaten in all seven bouts before beating Asahiry≈´ in a play-off. He was promoted to the makushita division for the January 2017 tournament, where he turned in a make-koshi record of 3‚Äì4. He returned to j≈´ry≈ç for the September 2018 tournament after an absence of 13 tournaments. He is the first former sanyaku ranked wrestler to make a return to j≈´ry≈ç from the sandanme division. (This feat was matched by Terunofuji and Chiyootori in November 2019.) He was forced to withdraw with a foot injury on Day 14 of the January 2019 tournament, and with only five wins he was demoted back to the makushita division. Fighting style J≈çk≈çry≈´'s favoured kimarite or techniques are migi yotsu (a left hand outside, right hand inside grip on his opponent's mawashi), yorikiri (force out) and uwatenage (overarm throw).

It is known as the premier tailgating space for sports events held at the stadium and the nearby Smoothie King Center. The plaza also consists of an outdoor amphitheater, known as Bold Sphere Music (often referred to as \\"Blue Sphere Stage\\"). The venue was reopened April 25, 2014 with a concert by Lana Del Rey. The amphitheater has seating for up to 9,000 spectators for special events, 7,000 in a general admission setting and 4,500 for reseated seating. History The site was originally the location of the Girod Street Cemetery from 1822 to 1957. The cemetery was moved prior to the construction of the Superdome, and subsequently the New Orleans Centre shopping mall was erected on the site. In 2005, the shopping mall closed due to Hurricane Katrina. The shopping mall never re-opened, and was almost entirely demolished in the Spring of 2010 to begin construction of Champions Square. The former Macy's department store area and the parking garage, now called \\"Champions Garage\\", are the only remnants of the original shopping mall. Features The 121,000 square-foot plaza is centered on the Mercedes-Benz Superdome, Smoothie King Center, Hyatt Regency, Benson Tower, and numerous parking garages and food courts. Phase I included the construction of the plaza and staircase leading from the Superdome. Construction initially began in the Spring of 2010 and Champions Square formally opened August 21, 2010. Phase II further improved the square following the 2010-2011 NFL season with the installation of a new permanent grand staircase with amphitheater seating, permanent restroom facilities, stone pavement, LED lighting, palm trees, and a vine wall spanning the length of the plaza alongside the Superdome. Before each NFL football game, the square hosts concerts which are free and open to the public. The square is only open to pedestrian traffic. Inside the square, there are numerous food and beverage options either in the food court or outside under tents. Champions Square has become the site for the annual \\"Gleason Gras\\", whose purpose is to raise awareness and funds for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Future expansion In 2013 construction was completed on a four level balcony added to the southern side Benson Tower overlooking the square. The addition also houses a secondary studio for the Benson-owned Fox station WVUE- DT (Channel 8), which airs their morning newscasts, Saints and sports-related programming from that facility. The Times-Picayune reported on August 15, 2010 that Phase III would include building out the fa√ßade and adding a permanent food court, and would be completed sometime after New Orleans hosted Super Bowl XLVII in 2013. Beyond that, planners have envisioned the area will be successful enough to build a residential tower sprouting out of the top of the former Macy's department store space.

The current building was built in 1903 but replaced an earlier structure on the same site. Although it is still relatively well-preserved it is obscured by the King's Way overpass. History Original structure In 1869 George William Hall applied for a publican's licence for a house built of wood and plaster and situated at corner of Moray-street and Sandridge-road (now City Road). He was granted a licence and named this establishment the Main Point Hotel. Ownership of the hotel transferred to Alexander Marks in 1870 and towards the end of 1871 the hotel was renovated. Unfortunately Marks‚Äô original application appears to have been issued improperly. Magistrate Mr. C. Mollison PM refused to renew the license in 1872 meaning Main Point could not legally operate for several months until the issue was resolved. Marks died in November 1873 age 36. At some point the hotel passed to J. F. Kennedy. On his death in 1899 his executrix ordered the property to be sold. Main Point was advertised as a going concern, having already been leased to a good tenant for five years at ¬£150 per year. Emily and James Rubira are likely to have purchased the hotel at this time. Current structure It is not clear why Emily and James Rubira decided to rebuild the hotel, but in 1903 they demolished the former structure and started work on the new hotel. Mr. Rubira was already operating a successful cafe and hotel at 305 Bourke Street. Rubira sold the Bourke Street cafe in 1927 for a ¬£50,000 . and was therefore a man of some wealth. The area around the Main Point hotel developed a somewhat sordid reputation. Numerous bashings and robberies are reported in this area, and hotels frequently pushed the boundaries of their licensing regulations. Licence deprivation Main Point escaped an earlier attempt at licence reduction in 1908, but by 1926 again the licensing commissioner believed that there was an ‚Äòoverstocking‚Äô of hotels within Melbourne causing ‚Äòkeen competition‚Äô and illegal trading. De-licensing six hotels within the South Melbourne area was proposed by the licensing court, and this was thought not to inconvenience the public as the demand for accommodation was not great. Concerns were further heighted by the opening of the new Spencer Street Bridge, thus diverting more traffic away from the area of South Melbourne. In considering closure, the commissioner, Mr. Barr, described cited poor buildings, lack of accommodation, number of hotels (in proximity) and the number of convictions as his criteria for determining license deprivation. In giving evidence to retain its license, Mr. Rubira told the licensing court that if hotel were permitted to retain, he would consider building an establishment ‚Äòon the lines of his Bourke Street Caf√©‚Äô. By June the fate of Main Point had been sealed and in November, the compensation packages were announced. Businesses were to cease trading by 31 December 1926. The operator of Main Point at that time, Thomas Rayner Keane, died shortly before compensation was announced but was declared insolvent in 1928. Within very close proximity to Main Point, the Trades Hotel was also de-licensed, but the George Hotel and the Castlemaine (Commercial) Hotel remained. Over 128 hotels have been recorded in the South Melbourne area.http://www.skhs.org.au/SKHShotels/pdf%20Files/Map%20of%20Hotels%20in%20South%20Melbourne.pdf Post de-licensing The hotel appears to have continued operating as a cafe and was the scene of an assault of one employee on another employee in 1935. The Main Point hotel has operated as home of the Costume Shop for over 20 years Urban renewal Southbank was the one of the subjects of the Victorian Government urban renewal push in the 1990s. Developers purchased large parts of Southbank and developed a number of residential and commercial sites. In 2011, the City of Melbourne released a strategic plan for the redevelopment of Southbank. The land adjoining the Main Point hotel was purchased by Central Equity and the Main Point tower started construction in 2011. The adjoining tower will be one of the tallest buildings in Melbourne. Thankfully, the Main Point Hotel remains undisturbed in this development and regains some its prominence lost when it was obscured by the Kings Way overpass. Other references During the First World War, two enlisted soldiers are known to have links with the hotel. Lance Corporal Slocombe listed his mother, Mrs Hastain, as residing at the Main Point Hotel. Private Mack listed his address, and the address of his next-of-kin (sister), at the Main Point Hotel in 1916.

It is used very commonly in the geosciences, particularly for atmospheric sounding. A matrix inverse problem looks like this: : \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\vec x = \\\\vec y The essential concept is to transform the matrix, A, into a conditional probability and the variables, \\\\vec x and \\\\vec y into probability distributions by assuming Gaussian statistics and using empirically-determined covariance matrices. Derivation Typically, one expects the statistics of most measurements to be Gaussian. So for example for P(\\\\vec y|\\\\vec x), we can write: : P(\\\\vec y|\\\\vec x) = \\\\frac {1} {(2 \\\\pi)^{m n/2} \\\\boldsymbol{S_y}|} \\\\exp \\\\left [ -\\\\frac{1}{2} (\\\\boldsymbol{A} \\\\vec{x} - \\\\vec{y})^T \\\\boldsymbol {S_y}^{-1} (\\\\boldsymbol{A} \\\\vec{x} - \\\\vec{y}) \\\\right ] where m and n are the numbers of elements in \\\\vec x and \\\\vec y respectively \\\\boldsymbol{A} is the matrix to be solved (the linear or linearised forward model) and \\\\boldsymbol{S_y} is the covariance matrix of the vector \\\\vec y. This can be similarly done for \\\\vec x: : P(\\\\vec x) = \\\\frac {1} {(2 \\\\pi)^{m/2} \\\\boldsymbol {S_{x_a}}|} \\\\exp \\\\left [-\\\\frac {1}{2} (\\\\vec{x}-\\\\widehat{x_a})^T \\\\boldsymbol {S_{x_a}}^{-1} (\\\\vec{x}-\\\\widehat{x_a}) \\\\right ] Here P(\\\\vec x) is taken to be the so-called \\"a-priori\\" distribution: \\\\widehat{x_a} denotes the a-priori values for \\\\vec{x} while \\\\boldsymbol{S_{x_a}} is its covariance matrix. The nice thing about the Gaussian distributions is that only two parameters are needed to describe them and so the whole problem can be converted once again to matrices. Assuming that P(\\\\vec x|\\\\vec y) takes the following form: : P(\\\\vec x|\\\\vec y) = \\\\frac {1} {(2 \\\\pi)^{m n/2} \\\\boldsymbol {S_x} |} \\\\exp \\\\left [ -\\\\frac{1}{2} (\\\\vec{x} - \\\\widehat{x}) ^T \\\\boldsymbol {S_x}^{-1} (\\\\vec{x} - \\\\widehat{x}) \\\\right ] P(\\\\vec y) may be neglected since, for a given value of \\\\vec x, it is simply a constant scaling term. Now it is possible to solve for both the expectation value of \\\\vec x, \\\\widehat{x}, and for its covariance matrix by equating P(\\\\vec x|\\\\vec y) and P(\\\\vec y|\\\\vec x)P(\\\\vec x). This produces the following equations: : \\\\boldsymbol{S_x} = (\\\\boldsymbol{A}^T \\\\boldsymbol{S_y^{-1}} \\\\boldsymbol{A} + \\\\boldsymbol{S_{x_a}^{-1}})^{-1} : \\\\widehat{x} = \\\\widehat{x_a} + \\\\boldsymbol{S_x} \\\\boldsymbol{A}^T \\\\boldsymbol{S_y}^{-1}(\\\\vec{y}-\\\\boldsymbol{A} \\\\widehat{x_a}) Because we are using Gaussians, the expected value is equivalent to the maximum likely value, and so this is also a form of maximum likelihood estimation. Typically with optimal estimation, in addition to the vector of retrieved quantities, one extra matrix is returned along with the covariance matrix. This is sometimes called the resolution matrix or the averaging kernel and is calculated as follows: : \\\\boldsymbol{R} = (\\\\boldsymbol{A}^T \\\\boldsymbol{S_y}^{-1} \\\\boldsymbol{A} + \\\\boldsymbol{S_{x_a}}^{-1})^{-1} \\\\boldsymbol{A}^T \\\\boldsymbol{S_y}^{-1} \\\\boldsymbol{A} This tells us, for a given element of the retrieved vector, how much of the other elements of the vector are mixed in. In the case of a retrieval of profile information, it typical indicates the altitude resolution for a given altitude. For instance if the resolution vectors for all the altitudes contain non-zero elements (to a numerical tolerance) in their four nearest neighbours, then the altitude resolution is only one fourth that of the actual grid size.

It was introduced by Tetsuo Asano, Jiri Matousek, and Takeshi Tokuyama in 2007. Formally, it is a fixed point of a certain function. Its existence or uniqueness are not clear in advance and have been established only in specific cases. Its computation is not obvious too. A particular but informative case Consider a group of n different points \\\\\\\\{p_1,\\\\ldots,p_n\\\\\\\\} in the Euclidean plane. Each point is called a site. When we speak about the Voronoi diagram induced by these sites, we associate to the site \\\\displaystyle{p_k} the set \\\\displaystyle{R_k} of all points in the plane whose distance to the given site \\\\displaystyle{p_k} is not greater to their distance to any other site p_j,\\\\,j eq k. The collection (R_k)_{k=1}^n of these regions is the Voronoi diagram associated with these sites, and it induces a decomposition of the plane into regions: the Voronoi regions (Voronoi cells). In a zone diagram the region associated with the site p_k is defined a little bit differently: instead of associating it the set of all points whose distance to p_k is not greater than their distance to the other sites, we associate to p_k the set R_k of all points in the plane whose distance to p_k is not greater than their distance to any other region. Formally, :R_k=\\\\\\\\{x\\\\,|\\\\,\\\\,d(x,p_k)\\\\leq d(x,R_j),\\\\,\\\\text{for all}\\\\, j eq k\\\\\\\\}. Here \\\\displaystyle{d(a,b)} denotes the euclidean distance between the points a and b and d(x,A)=\\\\inf\\\\\\\\{d(x,a) \\\\,|\\\\, a\\\\in A\\\\\\\\} is the distance between the point x and the set A. In addition, x=(x_1,x_2)\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^2 since we consider the plane. The tuple (R_k)_{k=1}^n is the zone diagram associated with the sites. The problem with this definition is that it seems circular: in order to know R_k we should know \\\\displaystyle{R_j} for each index j,\\\\,j eq k but each such \\\\displaystyle{R_j} is defined in terms of \\\\displaystyle{R_k}. On a second thought, we see that actually the tuple (R_k)_{k=1}^n is a solution of the following system of equations: : \\\\begin{cases} R_1=\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^2\\\\,|\\\\,\\\\,d(x,p_1)\\\\leq d(x,R_j),\\\\,\\\\text{for all}\\\\, j eq 1\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\quad\\\\quad\\\\quad\\\\quad\\\\quad\\\\quad\\\\quad\\\\quad\\\\quad\\\\quad\\\\quad\\\\quad\\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ R_n=\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^2\\\\,|\\\\,\\\\,d(x,p_n)\\\\leq d(x,R_j),\\\\,\\\\text{for all}\\\\, j eq n\\\\\\\\} \\\\end{cases} Rigorously, a zone diagram is any solution of this system, if such a solution exists. This definition can be extended without essentially any change to higher dimensions, to sites which are not necessarily points, to infinitely many sites, etc. Interpretation In some settings, such as the one described above, a zone diagram can be interpreted as a certain equilibrium between mutually hostile kingdoms,. In a discrete setting it can be interpreted as a stable configuration in a certain combinatorial game. Formal definition Let \\\\displaystyle{(X,d)} be a metric space and let \\\\displaystyle{K} be a set of at least 2 elements (indices), possibly infinite. Given a tuple (P_k)_{k\\\\in K} of nonempty subsets of \\\\displaystyle{X} , called the sites, a zone diagram with respect to this tuple is a tuple R=(R_k)_{k\\\\in K} of subsets of \\\\displaystyle{X} such that for all k\\\\in K the following equation is satisfied: : R_k=\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in X\\\\,|\\\\,\\\\,d(x,P_k)\\\\leq d(x,R_j),\\\\,\\\\text{for all}\\\\, j eq k\\\\\\\\}. Zone diagram as a fixed point The system of equations which defines the zone diagram can be represented as a fixed point of a function defined on a product space. Indeed, for each index k\\\\in K let \\\\displaystyle{X_k} be the set of all nonempty subsets of \\\\displaystyle{X}. Let :Y=\\\\prod_{k\\\\in K} X_k and let \\\\text{Dom}:Y\\\\to Y be the function defined by \\\\displaystyle{\\\\text{Dom}(R)=S}, where S=(S_k)_{k\\\\in K} and : S_k=\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in X\\\\,|\\\\,\\\\,d(x,P_k)\\\\leq d(x,R_j),\\\\,\\\\text{for all}\\\\, j eq k\\\\\\\\}. Then \\\\displaystyle{R} is a zone diagram if and only if it is a fixed point of Dom, that is, R=\\\\displaystyle{\\\\text{Dom}(R)}. Viewing zone diagrams as fixed points is useful since in some settings known tools or approaches from fixed point theory can be used for investigating them and deriving relevant properties (existence, etc.). Existence and uniqueness Following the pioneering work of Asano et al. (existence and uniqueness of the zone diagram in the euclidean plane with respect to finitely many point sites), several existence or existence and uniqueness results have been published. As of 2012, the most general results which have been published are: * 2 sites (existence): there exists at least one zone diagram for any pair of arbitrary sites in any metric space. In fact, this existence result holds in any m-space (a generalization of metric space in which, for instance, the distance function may be negative and may not satisfy the triangle inequality). * More than 2 sites (existence): there exists a zone diagram of finitely many compact and disjoint sites contained in the interior of a compact and convex subset of a uniformly convex space. This result actually holds in a more general setting. * More than 2 sites (existence and uniqueness): there exists a unique zone diagram with respect to any collection (possibly infinite) of closed and positively separated sites in any finite-dimensional euclidean space. Positively separated means that there exists a positive lower bound on the distance between any two sites. A similar result was formulated for the case in which the normed space is finite-dimensional and is both uniformly convex and uniformly smooth. * non-uniqueness: simple examples are known even for the case of two point sites,. Computation More information is needed. Related objects and possible applications In addition to Voronoi diagrams, zone diagrams are closely related to other geometric objects such as double zone diagrams, trisectors, k-sectors, mollified zone diagrams and as a result may be used for solving problems related to robot motion and VLSI design,.

It was completed in time for the Mount Holly Fair in September, 1892, and the purpose of the railway was supposed to have been enabling employees to commute quickly from Mount Holly to the factory at Smithville. Monthly commuter tickets cost $2.00 (equivalent to $ today). The record speed on the railway was 4.5 minutes (an average of ), and the average trip took 6‚Äì7 minutes. The railway was exhibited at the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. It only had one track so that it was impossible to pass another rider, and if riders travelling in opposite directions met, one had to pull off onto a siding. By 1897 ridership had declined, and the railway fell into disrepair.

She most recently played for Turbine Potsdam in the German Bundesliga and Seattle Reign FC of the National Women's Soccer League. Deines was a fourth round pick (23rd overall) of the Atlanta Beat of Women's Professional Soccer in the 2012 WPS Draft of college seniors on January 13, 2012. The WPS Board of Governors voted to suspend the 2012 season on January 30 citing pending legal issues. Subsequently, she was free to sign with other teams and rejoined the Seattle Sounders Women, the organization she had previously played for from 2007 to 2009. After the formation of the National Women's Soccer League in late 2012, Deines played for the Seattle Reign during the league's first two seasons. She was traded to FC Kansas City in late 2014 but announced her retirement from professional soccer on March 31, 2015 before the 2015 season began. Early life Deines was born in Portland, Oregon, on September 17, 1989 to Matt and Betsy Deines. As a freshman at Issaquah High School, Deines helped lead the soccer team to its first state championship final since 1988 and first title ever. Deines led the team to four consecutive conference championships from 2004 to 2007 and four state title games, winning three of them. Issaquah's lone runner-up finish was in 2005 when Deines was forced to miss the championship game to join the United States Youth Soccer Association Olympic Development Program in Boca Raton, Fla. following the semifinal. Issaquah went on undefeated the next two years with Deines in the lineup. Deines capped off her high school career by scoring the game-winning goal in the 71st minute of the 2007 state final, a 1‚Äì0 victory over Seattle Prep. Deines finished with a total of 76 goals and was named to the all-state team four times and chosen as the state's Gatorade Player of the Year twice. During her senior year she was named to the Parade and NSCAA/adidas Girls High School All-America teams. Deines has played soccer with the Seattle Sounders Women since joining the team in 2007 while still in high school. University of Washington Deines was a four-year starter for the Washington Huskies, starting a school-record 86 games and scoring 21 goals. She was named to the Pac-10 All-Freshman First Team and was a four-time All-Pac-10 selection and a two-time NSCAA Scholar All-American. As a freshman at the University of Washington, Deines helped the Huskies return to the NCAA Tournament after a three-year absence. She played a leading role as team captain during her junior year. She converted two key penalty kicks, including the game winner, during an epic penalty shoot-out in a shocking upset of the No. 2 overall seed University of Portland in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. The Huskies would eventually go on to the Elite Eight where they were eliminated in an overtime loss at Boston College. Playing career Club Drafted to the Atlanta Beat, 2012 Deines was selected as a fourth round pick (23rd overall) by the Atlanta Beat in the 2012 WPS Draft of college seniors on January 13, 2012; however, the league suspended operations before play began. From Seattle to Iceland, 2012 After the WPS folded in 2012, Deines signed with the Seattle Sounders Women. She made 12 appearances for the club, scoring one goal. Following the conclusion of the W-League season, Deines and her Sounders teammate and fellow University of Washington alum, Veronica Perez, played for Stjarnan Women in Iceland's top division. The team won the Icelandic Women's Cup after a 1‚Äì0 win over Valur. Of her time in Iceland, Deines said, \\"Even though it was a spur of the moment decision to play overseas in Iceland, I believe my three month stint helped in my development as a player. Icelandic soccer was not nearly as technical or tactical as soccer in the United States but the extreme physicality of our practices and games challenged me to play with a whole new level of aggression. Playing professionally in Iceland also allowed me an opportunity to keep practicing and playing games on a daily basis which would not have been the case if I would have stayed in the United States.\\" Seattle Reign FC, 2013‚Äì14  In February 2013, Deines signed with the Seattle Reign FC as a free agent for the inaugural season of the NWSL. Deines made 17 appearances for the club with 11 starts, tallying a total of 979 minutes. Potsdam, 2014‚Äì15 In September 2014, Deines signed a one-year contract with Germany's Turbine Potsdam in the Bundesliga.http://www.womensoccer.de/2014/09/01/turbine-potsdam-verpflichtet- us-duo/ International Deines was a member of the United States U-23 women's national soccer team and traveled to Sweden in June 2011. Personal life Deines' younger brother Jay is an offensive lineman on the football team at Eastern Washington University.

Sessional lecturers are contract faculty who hold full- or part-time teaching positions and may perform administrative duties but have no research responsibilities. Sessionals hold short-term contracts, typically running one or two academic terms; in many post-secondary institutions sessional contracts may be renewed repeatedly but by definition, they offer no legal expectation of ongoing work. Unlike members of other academic ranks (e.g., Assistant Professors and Full Professors), sessional lecturers are ineligible for tenure. Although significant differences exist between the working conditions of sessional lecturers and professors, sessionals occupy a rank similar to that of adjunct professors in the United States. Historically, sessionals have been hired to address short- term teaching shortages and to replace tenure-stream faculty who are on leave or who are holding temporary administrative positions (e.g., Faculty Chair or Dean). Possibly because on a per-course basis sessionals earn much less than their tenure-stream counterparts, in the last three decades many universities and colleges have developed a heavy reliance on contract faculty, with the result that the Canadian post-secondary educational system has developed a structural reliance on sessional faculty. In a number of large research universities, including the University of British Columbia and the University of Toronto, sessionals now teach the majority of undergraduate courses in some departments.http://www2.macleans.ca/2011/01/20/whatever-happened-to-tenure/ Although most sessional lecturers are trained as researchers and hold a PhD or other terminal degree, their contracts usually specify only teaching responsibilities, and their research programs are rarely supported by the universities that employ them. Common impediments to sessionals' research activities have historically included low salaries, ineligibility for merit pay and internal research funding,See, e.g. and institutional policies against signing applications for funding from granting agencies. Because an active research program and a strong publishing record (for original research) in major journals is often a key qualification for entry into a tenure-stream position, work as a sessional lecturer is widely considered among academics to be an \\"employment ghetto\\". The trend towards increasing reliance on sessional lecturers and other contract faculty is an instance of the casualization of academic work and has been criticized by the Canadian Association of University Teachers, which has proposed that the current per-course stipend be replaced by a pro-rata model that recognizes the teaching, research, and governance contributions of contract faculty.http://www.caut.ca/uploads/CAS- stongertogether.pdf As a labour group, sessional lecturers are organized in a variety of ways. In some universities, including Queen's, the University of Alberta, and the University of British Columbia, they are represented along with tenured and tenure-stream faculty in a single faculty association;http://www.facultyassoc.ubc.ca/sessionalfaculty.php in others, including University of Toronto, York University, and the University of Saskatchewan, they are represented as a distinct employment group by Canadian Union of Public Employee (CUPE) locals or stand-alone unions;http://cupe3902.org/https://www.usask.ca/hrd/docs/CUPE3287_CA_2005_2010.pdf in a few post-secondary institutions, they are not represented by a labour organization.

It is located in Southern Ontario, Canada. Getting its name from the historic City of Galt (now the City of Cambridge) that it passes through, the track runs from the bustling hub of Toronto, Ontario, to London, Ontario. GO Transit's Milton GO train service operates on this line from Toronto Union Station to Milton GO station. The rest of the line plays host to mixed freight and intermodal traffic, from Toronto to termini like Detroit, and Chicago. This Central Ontario line also had CP passenger rail service till 1971 when it was eliminated. Passenger rail service would be partly restored halfway through the line through the introduction of GO Transit operations in 1981 westward only as far as the Town of Milton.  GO Transit Operations  On October 27, 1981, GO Transit began running loaded passenger trains from Union Station to Milton GO station, then deadheading to Guelph Junction. This process was reversed in the mornings. These trains are powered by the MPI MP40PH-3C locomotives, and haul 12 Bombardier BiLevel passenger coaches. The stations along the line are (from Milton east to Union): * Milton * Lisgar * Meadowvale * Streetsville * Erindale * Cooksville * Dixie * Kipling * Union More recently, GO Transit has stopped deadheading their trains to Guelph Junction for overnight and weekend storage - they have built a yard just west of 5th line in Milton, with a connecting siding directly from the GO station. There are 10 trains operating on a weekday basis, to Toronto in the mornings, and to Milton in the evenings. GO does not operate any \\"express\\" service on their Milton Line. Since the loss of passenger rail service to the City of Galt in 1971, taxpayers, community leaders and politicians from the City of Cambridge have been lobbying the provincial government for decades for the restoration of passenger rail service. This issue is still ongoing as Cambridge is the largest city in Ontario without passenger rail service.  Canadian Pacific freight operations  CP runs several freight trains in both ways along almost the full length of the subdivision. They do not run the full length of the line, as the portion that ran south-east to Union Station was sold to Metrolinx/GO transit. From Lambton Yard west, freight traffic begins on the Galt Subdivision. More recently around October 2010, unit trains have commenced operation on the Galt sub. These ethanol trains come in the way of train ID numbers 650 as eastbound loaded movements, with 651 being the westbound empty return movements. There are many other trains as well, such as manifests, intermodals, double-stacks, autorackers, and even the almost-weekly Expressway train. Regulated operating speeds on the Galt Subdivision range from 50-60 mph/80‚Äì96 km/h.

By the mid-1840s William Taylor had taken over active management of the company, although Benjamin Fitch remained involved in applying his skills to production methods and tools. The Taylor Companies Factory 1899 In 1871 W. O. Taylor's son, Vincent A. Taylor took over the active management of the company, and the name was changed to W. O. Taylor and Son. In 1876 the International Exhibition in Philadelphia awarded the company a prize for outstanding products and methods. In 1885, it was incorporated as The Taylor Chair Company. As an Ohio Corporation it began with capitalization of $100,000 and an issue of 1,000 shares of stock. Following incorporation the company grew in volume of sales and in the breadth of its product lines. By 1907 there were 102 different designs of chairs being produced. In 1913 the company began the design of office furniture. When World War I broke out the company supplied furniture for military offices throughout the country. The company survived the depression, and during the World War II years of 1941-1945 it became extremely busy filling government orders In 1945 the pent-up civilian demand for furniture produced high levels of business. By 1947 the company employed the largest number of people in its history. The 1950s and 1960s saw a continued expansion of product lines, including chairs, sofas, and tables available to professional interior designers. The alertness of The Taylor Chair Co. in responding to changing market conditions has been a major factor in the success of the company. On June 8, 2012 the Taylor Company announced that the company would close. The last day of regular operation was June 15, 2012. Parts of the plant remained open for a few weeks to complete orders. Equipment used for production is being auctioned in August 2012. No plans for the building have been announced. Company archives and artifacts were divided between the Bedford Historical Society and the Western Reserve Historical Society.  Sustainability  Taylor initiated various sustainable manufacturing practices. In July 2006, Taylor moved to a new factory on a remediated 50 acre brownfield that had been abandoned since 1987.http://www.epa.state.oh.us/portals/30/Brownfield_Conference/docs/Craig%20Kasper- Steve%20Giles-Kara%20Allison-Mike%20Malis.pdf The former brownfield is now called Tinker's Creek Commerce Park and it is where Taylor operates its Bedford, Ohio factory and headquarters. By investing in energy efficient equipment, having an energy audit and implementing better practices in the factory, Taylor‚Äôs aggregate consumption of natural gas, electricity and water was reduced by 59% at the new Bedford, Ohio manufacturing plant. 90% of the manufacturing waste that was generated at the Bedford, Ohio factory was diverted away from local landfills through recycling, upcycling and composting. At the Lynwood, California factory, 60% of the manufacturing waste was diverted from local landfills. Taylor reduced its costs by $20,000 through waste reduction and $80,000 through energy conservation efforts. In April, 2010, Taylor became the first furniture manufacturer member of The Climate Registry.http://www.theclimateregistry.org/members/ Taylor has received numerous national and regional recognition of its sustainability efforts: * North American Sustainable Enterprise People‚Äôs Choice Award, 2010 * Crain‚Äôs Cleveland Business Emerald Award, 2010http://www.crainscleveland.com/marketing/eaarchives10.html * North American Sustainable Enterprise of the Year, 2011 * SJF Institute Green Jobs Award, 2011 * Pillar Award, Sustainable Business Practices, 2011 The Taylor Cos., a nearly 200-year-old company that bills itself as the oldest furniture manufacturer in the United States, announced that it plans to go out of business. August 8, 2012 On September 18, 2012 the Gasser Chair Co. of Youngstown, Ohio announced that it had acquired the intellectual property of Taylor Chair Co. This will allow Gasser Chair, a manufacturer of commercial seating for the entertainment and hospitality industries, to expand into office seating. The agreement also allows Gasser Chair to use the Taylor brand name and customer list.http://businessjournaldaily.com/company-news/gasser- buys-taylor-chair-plans-new-product-lines-2012-9-18 References Category:Furniture companies of the United States Category:Companies based in Ohio Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1816 ","title":"The Taylor Companies"},{"id":"34427289","text":"A Different Sort of Solitude is a single by Steven Page.

It is linked to, and closely associated with, Gay's Arcade. History The property on which the Arcade was built was the scene of two disastrous fires: the first was George Debney's fine furniture factory and showrooms at 103‚Äì105 Rundle Street (parts of Section 84 and 85), which was destroyed, along with a great deal of stock and raw material, on the evening of 16 July 1855. Patrick Gay, who had been working for Debney, took over the business in 1867. He also took over the cabinetmaking business next door, owned by his father, also named Patrick Gay. Gay's Warehouse 1880 In 1880 the warehouse had a 52 ft frontage to Rundle Street and extended halfway to Grenfell Street. The rear half, which Gay had enlarged to three storeys, extended to Twin street, so the property was \\"L\\"-shaped, illustrated. the remaining portion at the corner of Twin and Rundle streets being occupied by James Calder's City Steam Biscuit Factory. Gay's Warehouse after the fire 1884 The premises were completely destroyed by fire on Saturday 15 November 1884. The shop had been closed around 2:30 pm, and first signs of smoke noticed around 9 pm, and a fire hose deployed around 10. Without any evidence, the newspapers assumed arson (\\"incendiarists\\"), perhaps thinking of a disgruntled ex-employee, as Gay had the previous year sacked some of his work-force in response to the economic downturn, and those remaining were on short hours. Though it was conceivable that someone in Baker & Chambers' Sturt Stables, between the rear of Gay's factory and Grenfell Street could have been responsible, there was no evidence to support arson. All witnesses insisted Gay maintained good relations with all employees, past and present, and there was no enmity between his English and German workmen, who were on equal pay rates. The insurance payout was enough to start again, but insufficient to cover losses.  Adelaide Arcade  Adelaide Arcade 1886 photo The Arcade 1886 engravingIn this etching (The Pictorial Australian January 1886, from the S. W. Sweet photograph), the wire basket surrounding the arc-light globe is shown clearly A Syndicate was formed consisting largely of Emanuel Cohen, J. M. Wendt, Patrick Gay, Saul Solomon, and L. H. Berens to erect a shopping arcade linking Rundle and Grenfell streets, the largest in the Southern Hemisphere. Withall & WellsLatham A(ugustus) Withall and Alfred Wells were also responsible for the Thebarton Town Hall in 1885, the Jubilee Exhibition Building in 1886 the new (1892) Stock Exchange Building, the Angas Buildings of the Adelaide Children's Hospital were selected as architects and W. Pett and Son as contractors. :In 1885 F. J. Beck & Co. purchased both Baker & Chambers' property, \\"Sturt Horse Bazaar\\" and Debney's land, the site of Gay's burnt-out furniture factory, to lease to the proponents of the Arcade. (The Rundle Street end consisted of two portions of sections 84 and 85, each of 53 ft 9 ins frontage, the eastern portion previously owned by Debney and leased to Gay.) Baker & Chambers moved their business to Currie Street, previously the John Bull Livery Stables. :In September 1885 F. J. Beck offered 50 year leases on two Grenfell Street properties not needed for the Arcades: adjoining Twin Street and the other side of the Arcade. It would have a frontage of 77 feet to Rundle Street and 97 feet to Grenfell Street, and possessed a right-of-way 12 feet wide along the whole length of the western side, and an entrance to Twin Street on the eastern side. The additional twenty feet on the eastern side of the Grenfell Street entrance was occupied by a Turkish Bath complex conducted by C. Bastard and F. Needham. (T. Bastard had the Public Baths on King William Road from 1861.) The design had a promenade 24 feet wide, the flooring material Carrara marble and black and white encaustic tiles in mosaic patterns, with 44 shops lining the arcade, each wide by feet deep, with 15 foot ceilings. The fronts of the shops and showrooms over in the arcade constructed entirely of open wood and iron framing, glazed with polished plate glass, and broken up in outline into identical bays. :Originally each of the 50 shops had a room on the upper floor directly overhead, for use as a workroom or similar, presumably with its own staircase. Later, as exists today, a balcony-style walkway was installed at the upper level on either side, and many of these rooms became separate shops. Entrances on Rundle and Grenfell streets were wide, flanked by larger shops, their fronts returning into the entrances. The slabs at the entrances were of Kapunda marble. The elevations, similar on both Rundle and Grenfell streets, were of Italian style; the lower half dominated by the glass shop-fronts and arcade entrances, protected by verandahs supported by decorative iron columns, with a square balcony at the centre, behind which was an octagonal tower and dome, bearing an Australian coat-of-arms (not _the_ coat of arms ‚Äî Federation was still 15 years away, but the design used bore a strong resemblance to that ultimately chosen). Inside, the ceiling featured wide cornices constructed of moulded galvanized iron, and the upper cornices being surmounted by a deep cove finished with panelled soffit, returning down the cove and across the ceiling, which is broken up into a series of deeply recessed panelled bays, glazed with diapered and coloured glass. Additional sunlight was supplied by circular bullseye lights in alternate bays of the cove. Special attention was devoted to the lighting and ventilation, the latter provided by air tunnels and shafts connected with the towers. Lighting at night was provided by sixteen Siemens arc lamps, each fitting having six carbon electrodes requiring replacement after 18 hours' service, the large glass globular fittings being suspended by a cables with pulleys to facilitate lowering for maintenance. Three-phase power for the lights was provided by a pair of Siemens alternators, belt driven from an Otto Crossley gas engine with a pair of one- ton flywheels. This equipment was housed in a separate engine room on the ground floor. This was only four years after the historic implementation of a similar system in Godalming. Gas lamps by Strode & Co. of London were provided external to each shop for illumination in the event of generator failure, or for decorative purposes. :Three fountains were erected in the promenade, and an underground tea-room was provided, as well as toilet facilities more than adequate for the expected large clientele. :Colonial material was used as far as possible, external walls being entirely of local bricks (2 million in total from the Metropolitan Brick Company, owned by Wendt) and faced with Portland cement. The contract, for somewhat over ¬£30,000, was signed on 29 April 1885. and the foundation stone laid by Mayor Bundey on 6 May 1885. Shareholders in addition to directors Solomon, Wendt, Cohen, Gay and Berens were Robert Carr Castle and Hermann Carl Koeppen Wendt. Defying the sceptics, the building was opened on Saturday 12 December 1885 by the Governor Sir William Robinson. It would have been completed by the promised date of 1 December but for late delivery of some imported items. The quantity of glass involved was prodigious: , of which more than was polished plate glass. The Arcade was built at a time of an economic downturn, and great difficulty was had in attracting paying tenants. A year's rent holiday was offered to suitable clients. Return on capital was so low that one-by-one the various subscribers relinquished their shares to Wendt, who by 1906 was the sole owner. Other accounts have the company going into liquidation and the assets being purchased by Wendt from the liquidator. Gay's Arcade Gay's Arcade frontage Twin Street, Adelaide Promenade, Gay's Arcade The Adelaide Arcade construction was well underway when a separate, though connected, venture was embarked on: a short arcade of similar design, between Twin Street and Adelaide Arcade close to its centre. In August 1885, just a few months after engaging architect and builder for the Adelaide Arcade, a different architect, James Cumming (c. 1825‚Äì1901), and contractor, Nicholas Wallis Trudgen (c. 1829‚Äì1892) were engaged for the extension, to be named Gay's Arcade. Gay's Arcade as designed had a frontage of to Twin Street and a depth of to Adelaide Arcade. The building on Twin Street would have three storeys, plus cellars, with five shops on the ground floor, with Gay's furniture store and workshops on the two upper floors. The passage through this building then opens up into an arcade of two storeys containing twelve shops, having carved wooden frames for plate-glass windows, all very similar to the Adelaide Arcade. The fronts of these shops to be chiefly plate-glass, with light wooden frames enclosed in ornamental cast-iron work. The roof would be of glass in metal sashes, with ample provision for ventilation, and the walkway paved with encaustic tiles, marble, and Mintaro slate. Where lighting in the main arcade was to be electric arc-lamps, in Gay's Arcade it would be by \\"Wenham\\" gas-lights, a recent innovation. This emphasis on lighting was a result of insistence by insurance companies that gas lighting for drapers shops' displays be outside the windows, another impetus for incandescent electric lighting, which became general around 1900. Gay was to occupy the two upper floors of the block building and one side of the arcade. As there is a right-of-way along the north side of the building, and a light court was reserved on the south side, adequate natural light was provided, and the shops had back entrances. \\"Wenham\\" gaslights were provided for illumination of the arcade in the evening. Later history With the death of Wendt, his legatees sold the Adelaide Arcade lease to two Adelaide industrialists: T. E. Crompton and one Simpson. Perhaps Alfred Allen Simpson (1875‚Äì1939) or Frederick Neighbour Simpson (1877‚Äì1954), who were related to Crompton by marriage. Those gentlemen later sold it to consortium of Charles Angel (c. 1877‚Äì1943), (Malcolm Eric) Angus Scott (‚Äì1951) and Captain Johann George Arnold (c. 1863‚Äì1949). The arcade grew to over 100 shops through the addition of a balcony area in the 1960s. On 3 August 1980, a fire started in Gays Arcade, which was largely destroyed, and smoke and other damage extended to Adelaide Arcade, which was closed to the public for over a week. On 21 October 1980, the building was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate. On 14 February 1985, it was listed on the South Australian Heritage Register. Hauntings The site where Francis Cluney's body was found The arcade is said to be haunted. Television show Haunting: Australia conducted the first ever official paranormal investigation of the Adelaide Arcade in 2013. The episode aired on Syfy Australia as episode 5 of the series. The episode features local paranormal historian, and recipient of the 2017 South Australian Emerging Historian of the Year Award, Allen Tiller. Haunting: Australia aired to a global audience via networks such as REALLY on UKTV and SYFY in USA.  Francis Cluney  Francis Cluney was an early beadle (caretaker) of the Arcade, who died in its engine room on 21 June 1887. He had become entangled with one of the two great flywheels of the gas engine that by belts drove the two alternators. Cluney had been deputised by the Arcade electrician H. Harcourt, who wished to visit the Jubilee Exhibition, to keep an eye on the plant but on no account to touch the machinery. It was conjectured that he slipped on floor of the engine-room; not unlikely as such floors are notoriously slippery. The engine room is reported to have become a dry cleaners shop. It is said that his death was caused by two unruly locals whom Cluney had kicked out of the arcade, pushing him into the generator. This is a paywall site that requires a subscription. His ghost was claimed to have been recorded on security camera footage in 2008. Footsteps and strange sounds have also been heard within the ceiling spaces, the rooftop and the dome of the arcade - all believed to be Francis Cluney.  Florence Horton  Shop 50 of the arcade is said to be haunted by the ghost of Florence Horton, a local woman who was walking down Rundle Street with two friends and was shot three times in the back by her estranged husband Thomas Horton on Saturday 27 February 1904. Florence was carried into a tobacconist, (now Koko Black/Shop 50 in the arcade), where she died soon after.  Sydney Kennedy Byron  Three year old Sydney Kennedy Byron died under unknown circumstances in the Regent Arcade, near the Adelaide Arcade, on the 10 or 11 January 1902. Sydney's mother, Bridget Lauretta Kennedy Byron, more commonly known as 'Madame Kennedy' a palm reader who worked from a shop front of the Adelaide Arcade, was tried but later acquitted of smothering the boy to death. She died six months later after drinking herself to death. Her body was found in the west parklands. The ghosts of Sydney and Bridget are said to haunt the alley between the Regent and Adelaide Arcades. Gallery Other arcades in Australia Adelaide Arcade was not the first in Australia. Melbourne had the Queen's Arcade in Lonsdale Street, Melbourne (1853), Victoria Arcade, Bourke Street, Melbourne (1854, reopened 1876), Royal Arcade, Bourke Street, Melbourne (1870), and Eastern Arcade, Bourke Street, Melbourne (1874) before 1885, and Sydney had the Royal Arcade between George and Pitt streets (1881), followed by the Sydney Arcade between George and King streets (1882). Melbourne's Royal Arcade has the record for the longest continuous operation.

Their 1943 record was 9-1-1. Coach Max Burnell. The Dragons tied with Mt. Carmel 0-0 in Catholic League Championship game. They won a coin flip to decide who would face Phillips (Public League champion) in the Chicago Prep Bowl. The Dragons beat Phillips 19-12 in Soldier Field (attendance: 80,000). The Dragons then traveled to New York City to play Mount St. Michael's of the Bronx in a special interdivisional game at the Polo Grounds for the \\"National Championship\\". The Dragons won 25-20 with two desperate goal line stands at the end of the game. Cross Country: St. George's cross country program, under Coach Don Amidei, won seven Catholic League titles (1953, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1958, 1959, 1960) and two Chicagoland Prep League titles (1961, 1962). Track & Field: The Dragons had one of the best runners in the nation in 1961. Tom Sullivan ran the 1600 in 4:02.4 (a converted time from mile of 4:03.5 to 1600 meters), which was the nation's best until future Olympian Jim Ryun broke the record three years later at 3:59.0. Basketball: 1943-44 Co-Catholic League Varsity Champs w/Mt. Carmel. 1952-53 Catholic League Varsity Champions. Baseball: Chicagoland Prep League Champs 1969. Closing The school closed after the 1968-1969 school year, despite students still attending and in all four years. The students who had not finished their high school education were sent to other schools, such as Notre Dame High School. These students came to be known colloquially as the 'Bastard Sons of St. George\\" or the \\"Bastard Sons of St. George's\\". The last yearbook issued by the school was titled The Last Georgian.

Example: A sloping, specular surface Geometry of a polarimetric detector relative to a sloping surface. The definition of the four Stokes components are, in a fixed basis: : \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array}{c} I \\\\\\\\\\\\ Q \\\\\\\\\\\\ U \\\\\\\\\\\\ V \\\\end{array} \\\\right] = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array}{c} |E_v|^2 + |E_h|^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ |E_v|^2 - |E_h|^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 \\\\operatorname{Re}\\\\left\\\\langle E_v E_h^* \\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 \\\\operatorname{Im}\\\\left\\\\langle E_v E_h^* \\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\end{array} \\\\right], where Ev and Eh are the electric field components in the vertical and horizontal directions respectively. The definitions of the coordinate bases are arbitrary and depend on the orientation of the instrument. In the case of the Fresnel equations, the bases are defined in terms of the surface, with the horizontal being parallel to the surface and the vertical in a plane perpendicular to the surface. When the bases are rotated by 45 degrees around the viewing axis, the definition of the third Stokes component becomes equivalent to that of the second, that is the difference in field intensity between the horizontal and vertical polarizations. Thus, if the instrument is rotated out of plane from the surface upon which it is looking, this will give rise to a signal. The geometry is illustrated in the above figure: \\\\theta is the instrument viewing angle with respect to nadir, \\\\theta_\\\\mathrm{eff} is the viewing angle with respect to the surface normal and \\\\alpha is the angle between the polarisation axes defined by the instrument and that defined by the Fresnel equations, i.e., the surface. Ideally, in a polarimetric radiometer, especially a satellite mounted one, the polarisation axes are aligned with the Earth's surface, therefore we define the instrument viewing direction using the following vector: :\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{v}} = (\\\\sin \\\\theta, ~0, ~\\\\cos \\\\theta). We define the slope of the surface in terms of the normal vector, \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}}, which can be calculated in a number of ways. Using angular slope and azimuth, it becomes: :\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}}=(\\\\cos \\\\psi \\\\sin \\\\mu,~\\\\sin \\\\psi \\\\cos \\\\mu,~\\\\cos \\\\mu), where \\\\mu is the slope and \\\\psi is the azimuth relative to the instrument view. The effective viewing angle can be calculated via a dot product between the two vectors: :\\\\theta_\\\\mathrm{eff} = \\\\cos^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{v}}), from which we compute the reflection coefficients, while the angle of the polarisation plane can be calculated with cross products: : \\\\alpha = \\\\mathrm{sgn}(\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{j}}) \\\\cos^{-1}\\\\left( \\\\frac { \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{j}} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{v}} } { |\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{v}}} \\\\right), where \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{j}} is the unit vector defining the y-axis. The angle, \\\\alpha, defines the rotation of the polarization axes between those defined for the Fresnel equations versus those of the detector. It can be used to correct for polarization mixing caused by a rotated detector, or to predict what the detector \\"sees\\", especially in the third Stokes component. See Stokes parameters#Relation to the polarization ellipse. Application: Aircraft radiometry data The Pol-Ice 2007 campaign included measurements over sea ice and open water from a fully polarimetric, aeroplane-mounted, L-band (1.4 GHz) radiometer. Since the radiometer was fixed to the aircraft, changes in aircraft attitude are equivalent to changes in surface slope. Moreover, emissivity over calm water and to a lesser extent, sea ice, can be effectively modelled using the Fresnel equations. Thus this is an excellent source of data with which to test the ideas discussed in the previous section. In particular, the campaign included both circular and zig- zagging overflights which will produce strong mixing in the Stokes parameters. Correcting or removing bad data To test the calibration of the EMIRAD II radiometer used in the Pol-Ice campaign, measurements over open water were compared with model results based on the Fresnel equations. The first plot, which compares the measured data with the model, shows that vertically polarized channel is too high, but more importantly in this context, are the smeared points in between the otherwise relatively clean function for measured vertical and horizontal brightness temperature as a function of viewing angle. These are the result of polarization mixing caused by changes in the attitude of the aircraft, particularly the roll angle. Since there are plenty of data points, rather than correcting the bad data, the authors simply exclude points for which the angle, \\\\alpha, is too large. The result is shown at far right. Predicting U Many of the radiance measurements over sea ice included large signals in the third Stoke component, U. It turns out that these can be predicted to fairly high accuracy simply from the aircraft attitude. We use the following model for emissivity in U: :e_U = \\\\sqrt{e_v^2 - e_h^2} \\\\sin (2 \\\\alpha) where eh and ev are the emissivities calculated via the Fresnel or similar equations and eU is the emissivity in U‚Äîthat is, U = e_U T, where T is physical temperature‚Äîfor the rotated polarization axes. The plot below shows the dependence on surface-slope and azimuth angle for a refractive index of 2 (a common value for sea ice ) and a nominal instrument pointing-angle of 45 degrees. Using the same model, we can simulate the U-component of the Stokes vector for the radiometer.

Among his first public works, from 1860, was painting the oval music hall in the Communal Theater of Carpi, in a style reminiscent of the Renassaince master Correggio. In the future, his style would acquire the flair of pittura di macchia (painting of dots) which was less linear, and using broad, rapid, thick brushstrokes. In 1867, he moves to Florence on a scholarship; there he works with Enrico Pollastrini, professor at the Academy of Fine Arts, who stressed the copying of old masters as the road to skill. He returns to Carpi in 1870, where he painted the Proclamation of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception in the left apse of the transept of the church of San Nicol√≤. In Reggio Emilia he painted in the Cathedral of the Assumption, and in churches of San Francesco and San Bernardino. He also produced some altarpieces including a Sacred Conversation for San Biagio in Palude. He also painted in the church of San Nicola di Bari, Sestola.

Traver (1894‚Äì1974) was a University of Massachusetts entomologist. Jeffrey Lockwood wrote in The Infested Mind: Why Humans Fear, Loathe, and Love Insects that she was responsible for \\"one of the most remarkable mistakes ever published in a scientific entomological journal\\".  Proceedings of the Entomological Society of Washington  Traver displayed evidence in her writing of having what has been described as a classic case of delusional parasitosis ‚Äì a mental disorder in which there is no evidence, yet individuals believe they have a parasitic infestation of the skin. After she was \\"rebuffed by doctors for years\\" when describing her symptoms, she embarked on a quest to identify the source of what she believed was an infestation causing her skin sores. A dermatologist said her symptoms \\"were largely imaginary\\" or \\"caused by an ill-advise (sic) attempt [at self-medication by the patient]\\". She convinced a neurologist that she did not need his help. She corresponded with others who reported similar symptoms, and used 22 different chemicals to attempt to rid herself of the infestation. She determined the cause of her infestation to be a rare dust mite that she thought came from a neighbor's cat or dog. In 1951, she published in the Proceedings of the Entomological Society of Washington a paper titled \\"Unusual Scalp Dermatitis in Humans Caused by the Mite, Dermatophagoides (Acarina, epidermoptidae)\\" summarizing her tribulations and findings. The article concluded with a \\"tirade against the 'medical profession' and her pride in rejecting the dermatologist‚Äôs verdict and having the knowledge to identify her invaders\\", according to Matan Shelomi. In the mid-1960s, another scientist, Alex Fain, discovered that Travers' account was a scientific impossibility, because dust mites do not burrow into human skin as Traver described; other inconsistencies are documented in the literature and described by Shelomi. Hinkle, Poorbaugh, Shelomi and others argue that the evidence that Traver had delusional parasitosis is contained in her detailed 1951 publication describing her symptoms. Lockwood concludes in The Infested Mind: Why Humans Fear, Loathe, and Love Insects that \\"Traver's account was a vivid, poignant, and tragic autobiography of a woman driven to desperate measures to affirm the reality of her delusion\\". In the 2013 article, \\"Mad Scientist: A Unique Case of a Published Delusion\\", Shelomi describes Traver as having a \\"textbook case\\" of delusional parasitosis. Shelomi argues that the paper published by Traver \\"is unique in the scientific literature in that its conclusions may be based on data that was unconsciously fabricated by the author's mind\\". Shelomi argues that the published work may have been accepted on the basis of her reputation as a scientist, although the writing was not the dispassionate writing typical of a scientist, and that it should not have been accepted for publication. He says the paper warrants retraction, but that doing so could raise concerns about discrimination against those with mental disorders, and questions the responsibility of medical journals when delusions are presented as science. He argues that the historical paper should be retracted because it has misled people about their delusions. He says the paper has done \\"permanent and lasting damage\\" to people with delusional parasitosis, \\"who widely circulate and cite articles such as Traver's and other pseudoscientific or false reports\\" via the internet, making treatment and cure more difficult. He compares it to the controversy with Andrew Wakefield's retracted paper that fueled the Lancet MMR vaccine autism fraud.

The genus is one of three genera in the subfamily Concavodontinae. Concavodonta is known solely from late Ordovician, Caradoc epoch, fossils found in Europe and South America. The genus currently contains three accepted species, Concavodonta imbricata, Concavodonta ovalis and the type species Concavodonta ponderata. Description Concavodonta is a small bivalve which was first described in 1972 by Claude Babin and Michel Melou. Generally the shells of Concavodonta are fairly rounded to ovoid in shape. As the type genus for the subfamily Concavodontinae, the hinge displays the typical chevroning of teeth where the concavity in the chevron faces away from the center of the hinge and the umbo. The adductor muscles for the shell are unequal in shape. The external surface of the shells show regular concentric ornamentation. The type species for the genus, Concavodonta ponderata, has been found in Middle to late Ordovician, Caradoc epoch sediments of Europe. The species was first described in 1881 by Joachim Barrande as Nucula ponderata. The species has been found in three Bohemian formations, the Bohdalec, Vinice, and Zahorany. It has since been found in the Late Ordovician sediments of Normandy, France. C. ponderata can be distinguished from the other two species in the genus by the structuring of the structure of the hinge plate, which is curved in C. imbricata, and by the overall shell outline, which is ovoid in C. ovalis. Concavodonta imbricata was described by Joseph Ellison Portlock as Nucula acuta? var imbricata based on a holotype specimen which has since been lost. With the reexamination of the species in 1982 by Steve Tunnicliff a lectotype specimen, NMI G.1. 1979 for the species which is deposited in the National Museum of Ireland, Dublin.

The process started by speaking into a microphone. The electrical signal from the microphone through a transformer supplied electric current from a battery pack that caused a corresponding variation in the light of an arc (later used an incandescent lamp). The light from the arc lamp passes through the cylindrical lens slot which created sharp white lines on the moving sensitive film. This film, after being taken out of the box and developed, shows a series of perpendicular striations parallel to one another, which are really a photographic record of the sound waves originally entering the telephone transmitter. To reproduce the sound an projector directs light through the film traveling with the velocity equal to that with which the record is made. Behind the film a sensitive selenium cell is mounted receiving the variations in light producing a variation in its resistance and a corresponding effect in the telephone receivers connected. \\"It is truly a wonderful process: sound becomes electricity, becomes light, causes chemical action, becomes light and electricity again, and finally sound.\\"Wireless Telephony In Theory and Practice by Ernst Ruhmer (translated from the German by James Erskine-Murray), 1908, page 39.

Editora Nacional, pp. 607, 748, 769. He was one of the commanders of the columns that defended Madrid (during the Siege of Madrid) from attacks led by General Varela. Starting in November 1936, following orders from Colonel Aureliano √Ålvarez-Coque, Romero commanded a battalion from the Bridge of the French, which was of crucial importance because of its strategic location on the Manzanares River. He effectively repelled attempted crossings and denied access to Madrid's city center. For his heroic performance he was promoted by General Miaja to Lieutenant Colonel, and was officially congratulated on the November 18 Agenda. The Government of the Republic later officially confirmed General Miaja's orders, and officially granted him such rank in April 1938.Mirta N√∫√±ez D√≠az-Balart (1992). La prensa de guerra en la zona republicana durante la Guerra Civil Espa√±ola (1936‚Äì1939), Madrid, Ediciones de la Torre, pag. 385 (War press in Republican Zone during the Spanish Civil War) Because of disagreements with anarchists, Colonel Romero Gim√©nez requested the dismissal of Ricardo Sanz, a Catalan anarcho- syndicalist, whom he accused of mistreating the soldiers and of bringing prostitutes to the trenches. He suggested to Miaja to Sanz's column (the former Durruti Column) be disbanded, and that its personnel be distributed amongst the remaining units fighting in the front.Historia del Ej√©rcito Popular de la Republica, op.cit.

He participated in the Battle of Brunete, although the performance of his unit was poor in the district of Usera. As commander of the Second Army Corps, he said, regarding forced recruitments that morale in his troops remained good amongst experienced militants but poor amongst recruits, due to their \\"complete ignorance of the reasons why we fight and a lack of citizen preparedness and desire for freedom\\".S.H.M., A.G.L.-L6.

For his performance fighting motorized divisions of the \\"Blackshirts\\" Italian CTV he was awarded his second \\"Medal of Courage\\". As Commander of the 4th Mixed Brigade, and with General Miaja's effective support, he founded and directed a war material factory called \\"Romero Mechanical Factories\\", which was dedicated to the production of mortars and ammunition, mines and hand grenades, bombs with aerodynamic design, thermoses, tripods, shields for trenches, spare parts for rifles, machine guns and antitank and antiaircraft guns as well as engine repairs. Work began with the machinery that could be rescued from the Madrid workshop \\"Mobile Park\\".'Parque M√≥vil' works were established on November 23. in platforms of the North Station by Alfonso Reyes Moreno. Operating under enemy shrapnel, there were a large number of casualties. During the Siege of Madrid, between 800 and 1,200 people worked around the clock, under constant enemy fire. Romero Gim√©nez is credited with the invention of the mine that bears his name \\"Mina Romero\\", an anti-tank system first used during the Siege of Madrid. It consisted of a large cast iron metal box designed to fragment and produce shrapnel, after the explosion of 15, 35 or 60 kg. of dynamite. The devices were hidden in the floor to burst enemy tanks from below. They detonated by means of copper wires and glass tanks, either manually or automatically.El Pa√≠s (Newspaper)- Paseo por el campo en busca de bombas de la Guerra Civil (Walk in the fields looking for bombs from the Civil War) - Madrid - 19 March 2007 This is a technical innovation which was subsequently applied during World War II. In the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War, Romero Gim√©nez was tried in absentia and sentenced twice to death by Garrote for fighting against the uprising, and for being a Mason.According with his file, process initiates during 1940, within the General Cause 1st. Military Region, ending with a dead sentence. Later, Colonel Romero is processed, also in absentia by the TERMEC Court (Spanish Tribunal for the Repression of Freemasonry and Communism) with summary 1278/1945 and a final decision taken in 1946 for a second death sentence.Files: AGGCE 289-B-34; 227-A-1, TERMEC n¬∫ 17.205; AGM, R-2825  Exile in France and Resistance  After the Civil War, Colonel Romero was exiled in France, initially in Clermont-Ferrand, later in Paris. He left Paris on 12 June 1940, just hours before the German occupation with the intention of embarking the ship SS Champlain was not able: this ship was attacked and sunk off the port. He settled in Bordeaux, a city also soon to be occupied by the Nazis.,Bravo et. al., \\"Nuevas Ra√≠ces, Testimonios de Mujeres Espa√±olas en el Exilio\\", Ateneo Espa√±ol de M√©xico, Editorial Joaqu√≠n Mortiz, Grupo Editorial Planeta, 1993. There, Romero played a leading role for two years in the Maquis French Resistance, coordinating actions such as disabling the detonators of bombs waiting to be dropped during The Blitz of London and other cities. As a result, many bombs failed to explode once hitting their targets. Also, he led the disablement of materials intended for the construction of a submarine base and the piercing of undetectable holes at the bottom of large cans of food ready to be sent for the German troops at the Russian front in order for the food to be rotten by the time the cans reached their destination. Romero was arrested by the Gestapo and imprisoned in the fearsome medieval prison \\"Fort du H√¢\\" in Bordeaux. He was subjected to severe tortures and interrogation and forced to witness the strangulation deaths of other fellow Resistance prisoners. Romero would escape death as a result of a ruse arranged by the Resistance and the Mayor of Bordeaux. The Mayor issued an official request for Romero to be transferred from the German to the French section of the prison, stating that he had to be processed by a French court, for a (non-existent) civil crime. Once in the French section of prison, the organization rescued Romero. It took nearly a month to physically recover from his torture injuries (in a hospital located very close to the prison, while using the identity of a dead man). Romero, his wife and daughter were then helped by the Resistance to cross the demarcation line into the 'free' Vichy France. They were all detained the next morning and imprisoned again by the collaborating gendarmerie. Romero was taken to the Gurs concentration camp, where along with Spanish refugees (including his friend, Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Buz√≥n Llanes) Jews were concentrated awaiting to be deported for extermination. He, his wife and daughter were saved due to the humanitarian proceedings of Gilberto Bosques,Bravo et. al., op. cit.Bosques has been called the \\"Mexican Schindler\\". His heroism remained unknown to the world at large for some sixty years. Since 2003, international recognition has been accruing to him. Consul of Mexico, distinguished for his outstanding work in helping Spanish refugees, Jews and other people being persecuted, providing them shelter in that country. Mexico was wide open to receive refugees, especially under the presidency of Lazaro Cardenas del Rio.Bravo et. al., op. cit. Overcoming many difficulties they were able to travel to Marseille, where they managed to embark for Oran. Thence the Trans-Saharan train would take them to Casablanca to wait for a ship to take Romero, wife and daughter across the Atlantic.  Exile in Mexico  Colonel Romero finally exiled in Mexico. He, his wife and daughter arrived to the port of Veracruz on 22 May 1942, after nearly a month's cruise aboard the second of three voyages made from Casablanca by the Portuguese ship Nyassa carrying to Mexico large contingents of refugees. In this country Romero re-founded the technical magazine Defensa Nacional (National Defense) with the participation of Spanish military refugees in cooperation with the Mexican Armed Forces. With his children Carmen and Carlos Romero Ortega created a publishing company named 'Sociedad Mexicana de Publicaciones'Bravo et. al., op. cit. (Carlos Jr., fighting at a young age for the defense of Madrid was separated by the war from his parents. He obtained political asylum in the Dominican Republic and later in Mexico). Colonel Romero established and directed Maderas Industrializadas y Reconstituidas, a company that pioneered industrialized wood. Immigration document as a political refugee in M√©xico After the death of Francisco Franco in 1975, despite having fulfilled all the formalities, Romero was never granted the state pension as a Spanish military Veteran.The Spanish government decreed, on 13 September 1936, that \\"all properties and documents belonging to the political parties and organizations mentioned, as well as any others that opposed the movimiento nacional, were to become the property of the State. See: General Archive of the Spanish Civil War. Once the Civil War finished, all -or almost all- files were taken by Franco's military personnel to concentrate them at the Consejo Supremo de Justicia Militar (Supreme Council of Military Justice), located in 4 Fortuny Street (formerly Consejo Supremo de Guerra y Marina, Supreme Council of War and Navy)In Francoist Spain, political background files of Republicans were concocted by the Delegaci√≥n Nacional de Servicios Documentales (National Delegation of Documentary Services). This Delegation was directly under the Government Presidency. Such files were used by the dictatorship's Court-martial, Tribunales de Responsabilidades Pol√≠ticas (Political Responsibility Courts) Tribunales de Depuraci√≥n de Funcionarios (Officers Depuration Courts) and Tribunal Especial para la Represi√≥n de la Masoner√≠a y el Comunismo (Special Court For The Repression of Masonry and Comunism). On 11 September 1978, Romero peacefully passed away surrounded by his family at age 87 in the Sanatorio Espa√±ol hospital in Mexico City.Death certificate: Acta de defunci√≥n, Regitro Civil de M√©xico D. F., Juzgado s√©ptimo, foja 395, libro 5/7a. In fulfillment of his will his body was cremated and the ashes divided into two equal parts to be spread to air, water and land, one half in Mexico and the other in Spain. The Spanish scattering took place during a public ceremony at the Bridge of the French.  Masonry  With a late ingress to Masonry in 1932 -being 42 years old- Romero entered Mare Nostrum, Lodge 11, of Madrid, Gran Oriente Espa√±ol (GOE), (Spanish Grand Orient). He subsequently moved into the Grand Spanish Lodge (GLE, Gran Logia Espa√±ola) of which Romero became Grand Chief in 1937, and the Governing Council's Great Expert by 1938. In 1939, as Counselor of the Masonic Family, Romero was responsible in France for coordinating support for exiled Masons and Republicans, altogether with the Relief Committee (Comit√© de Socorros). Spain brutally repressed Masonry, including -as in Romero's case- sentencing members to death by use of medieval torture instruments. Lodge files were used by TREMEC Court (Spanish Tribunal for the Repression of Freemasonry and Communism) as 'criminal' evidence, so the fraternity's records that could have been saved from confiscation were hidden or destroyed to save lives.See Suppression of Freemasonry, Spain.

Lyrics  Every word you're saying is a lie Run away my dear But every sign will say your heart is dead Bury all the memories Cover them with dirt Where's the love we once had Our destiny's unsure Why can't you see what we had Let the fire burn the ice Where's the love we once had Is it all a lie? And I still wonder Why heaven has died The skies are all falling I'm breathing but why? In silence I hold on To you and I Closer to insanity Buries me alive Where's the life we once had It cannot be denied Why can't you see what we had Let the fire burn the ice Where's the love we once had Is it all a lie? And I still wonder Why heaven has died The skies are all falling I'm breathing but why? In silence I hold on To you and I You run away You hide away To the other side of the universe where you're safe from all that hunts you down But the world has gone Where you belong And it feels too late so you're moving on Can you find your way back home? And I still wonder Why heaven has died The skies are all falling I'm breathing but why? In silence I hold on To you and I Every word you're saying is a lie.

They were named after Georges Leygues (1857-1933), a French politician and Minister of Marine. They are important as a breeding site for seabirds and fur seals. Geography The √éles Leygues lie across the Passe de la R√©solution from √éle Howe, and north of the main Kerguelen island of Grande Terre. The two largest islands are √éle de Castries and √éle Dauphine. √éle de Castries, the largest of them is 500 ha. Far to the north lie the Roches du Terror and to the east the Roches du Gallieni rocks. The landscape of the islands is mainly flat, though rising westwards to form coastal cliffs. Access from the sea is virtually impossible because of extensive banks of giant kelp surrounding the group. Ecology Humans have never set foot on the islands. A large colony of Antarctic fur seals occurs which has probably never been hunted and which has enabled the recolonisation of other sites from which the species was formerly exterminated.BirdLife International.

On or about February 4, 1896, two Mormon sheepherders were killed by an unknown assailant while they were camping along a creek in what was then part of Cassia County, Idaho. The gunfighter Diamondfield Jack Davis and his associate, Jack Gleason, were arrested, but the latter was released and Diamondfield Jack was pardoned in 1902, after serving six years in jail. The deaths of the two sheepherders are the only confirmed killings attributed to the conflict, however, according to author J. Anthony Lukas, the incident was \\"one of the last great confrontations in the sheep and cattle wars.\\" Background The leading figure in the conflict was a prominent cattleman named John Sparks. Sparks came to southern Idaho from Nevada in the early 1870s. A former Texas Ranger, Sparks was one of the first people to explore what was still a very isolated wilderness. Sparks later became the partner of another rancher named Jasper Harrell and eventually they established series of ranches on both sides of the Idaho-Nevada border. By the summer of 1895, Sparks was the most powerful cattleman in Idaho. He controlled huge stretches of territory, though his ownership was still mostly unofficial. Sparks felt that because he had used the lands for so many years without opposition, there was no way he was going to let the hated sheep destroy it. That year a wave of Mormons and Basques left Utah and headed north for Nevada and Idaho. Sheepherding was very popular in Utah so, when they left, the Mormons and Basques brought their sheep with them. Grazing sheep often proved to be very destructive to the environment, which cattlemen relied on for their livelihood. Sheepmen were known for letting their animals strip a pastureland of all vegetation, leaving it useless for the cattlemen who needed to use it next. Sheep also polluted water sources to where cattle would not use them. For this, cowboys referred to sheep as \\"desert maggots,\\" or \\"hoofed locusts.\\" Both of these factors prompted many cattlemen to begin building fences, or establishing deadlines, a type of boundary which sheep were not permitted to cross. John Sparks ran one of these deadlines through Elko County, Nevada and Cassia County, Idaho. Sheepmen were not allowed to go either west or south of the line. Sparks also hired several gunfighters as range detectives to \\"keep the sheep back.\\" Usually, the range detectives would simply threaten the herders and occasionally shoot up a flock, their only orders were to \\"shoot to wound\\", but only \\"if necessary.\\" Diamondfield Jack Davis was the most famous of the detectives and he was known for being exceptionally bloodthirsty. He led many of the raids in northern Nevada and even poisoned water sources with salt, making them unusable for either faction. During one of his forays, Diamondfield Jack wounded a sheepherder, named Bill Tolman, which was how the war began. Additional raids followed, but actual combat was limited because most of the sheepherders were too frightened to resist. One man was so afraid that he camped in the middle of his flock, hoping to evade patrolling cowboys. One night, about thirty of his sheep were shot dead around him, but he escaped unharmed. The murders Diamondfield Jack Davis was the prime suspect. The most remembered shooting incident to take place during the war happened at a place now known as Deadline Ridge. Late in 1895, two Mormon sheepherders named Daniel Cummings and John Wilson crossed the deadline in Cassia County to graze on the Deep Creek Range. A few weeks later, on about February 19, 1896, their bodies were discovered by another shepherd, Edgar \\"Ted\\" Severe. Both men died of gunshot wounds and the coroner who examined the deceased said they had been killed on February 4, 1896, or the day after. This was further substantiated by a lumberjack who delivered a load of wood to the sheepherders' camp on February 4. When police investigated the crime scene, they found that only a small portion of the wood had been used for a campfire so it seemed as though the murderer arrived shortly after the delivery and made his attack that night, or early the next morning. Diamondfield Jack was the prime suspect, mostly because in the past he said he would kill the next sheepherders who crossed the deadline in Cassia County. There was also evidence that Diamondfield had bragged about killing the two sheepherders when he turned up in Nevada sometime shortly after the murders. Aftermath Diamondfield Jack was brought back to Albion for his trial. He was defended by James H. Hawley, a future Idaho senator, but was quickly sentenced to hang on June 4, 1897, due to the efforts of William Edgar Borah, an attorney appointed by the Elko County Sheepmen's Association. However, while waiting for execution, two men named James Bower and Jeff Gray confessed to the murders. Although the two men were acquitted, their confession raised concern as to whether Diamonfield was truly responsible for the crime. For this, Jack's case was reprieved on the day before his execution was to take place. Jack remained in the Albion jail for two more years, waiting to be executed, but, on February 24, 1899, the Idaho legislature approved an act which ruled that all future executions must take place in the state penitentiary at Boise. As result, Jack arrived at the Boise Depot on February 27, 1899. He remained there until December, when the Supreme Court of Idaho decided that Jack should be sent back to Cassia County as a county prisoner, rather than a state prisoner. Jack was sentenced to die again, on July 3, 1901, but by that time, the public had become well aware of the situation and most thought he was innocent. Because of the public support and the influence of John Sparks, Jack's execution date was extended to July 17. He again escaped hanging though. On July 16, the Board of Pardons had Jack's sentence commuted to life in prison and he was sent back to Boise. This was largely because of Sparks, who, by that time, had been elected the governor of Nevada. When he was finally released from prison, in December 1902, Jack became a prospector and became wealthy digging for gold and establishing mining towns around Tonopah and Goldfield, Nevada. He died in 1949 after being hit by a taxi. Today there are several markers in Nevada and Idaho associated with Diamondfield Jack or the murder case he was involved with. Re-enactments of the murder are also held each year in parts of Nevada and Idaho. The graves of Daniel Cummings and John Wilson can still be seen in the Oakley, Idaho cemetery. In 1907, the area where the murders occurred became part of Twin Falls County.

Profile The focus of the organization has broadened over the years. In the 1980s, the ISSMP&D;, the International Society for the Study of Multiple Personality and Dissociation, grouped clinicians and researchers primarily interested in Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD). Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) had been called MPD since the 19th century, and was still called MPD in DSM-II and DSM-III. In the 1990s, DSM-IV changed the name of MPD to DID, and so the ISSMP&D; simplified its name to the ISSD - the International Society for the Study of Dissociation, broadening its interest to include the other dissociative disorders. By the 21st century, the ISSD had broadened its interest to include chronic developmental traumatic disorders (also known as Complex PTSD), and so the name was lengthened to ISSTD: the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation. Editors of the book Dissociation and the dissociative disorders: DSM-V and beyond describe the ISSTD as \\"The principle professional organization devoted to dissociation\\". The ISSTD has published guidelines for the treatment of dissociative identity disorder in both adults and children through its peer-reviewed Journal of Trauma & Dissociation (formerly Dissociation: Progress in the Dissociative Disorders), published five times per year. These guidelines are often referenced in the field as a basic starting point for psychotherapy with highly dissociative clients. The ISSMP&D;'s official journal, Dissociation: Progress in the Dissociative Disorders ceased operation after 39 issues (March 1988-December 1997), though its full-text contents have since been made available online. Controversies In the 1990s, controversies surrounding repressed memory and the possible connections between child abuse, traumatic events, memory and dissociation arose. Some mental health professionals who used hypnosis and other memory recovery techniques now known to contribute to the creation of false memories found their patients lodging bizarre accusations - including of satanic ritual abuse, sacrificial murder, and cannibalism \\\\- against their parents, family members and prominent community members. This era is now considered a moral panic, typically referred to as the ‚ÄúSatanic Panic.‚Äù The ISSTD has been accused by groups such as The False Memory Syndrome Foundation and The Satanic Temple of propagating Satanic Panic-era conspiracy theories. In 1995, ISSTD's founder and former president, Bennett Braun, was sued by a former patient who claimed that Braun had falsely convinced her that she'd engaged in Satanic rituals, cannibalism, and infanticide. The patient received a $10.6 million dollar settlement. Braun's medical license was temporarily suspended by Illinois state officials in 1999. In 2004, another former patient of Braun‚Äôs, Elizabeth Gale, filed a lawsuit against Braun and Roberta Sachs, another ISSTD founder, alleging that they and their colleagues convinced Gale ‚Äúthat her family indoctrinated her as a child so she would make babies for sacrifice in a satanic cult.‚Äù The settlement in the malpractice suit amounted to $7.5 million. Another ISSTD founder, Richard Kluft, wrote in 2014, ‚Äú[I]t is undeniable that satanic elements are employed at times by those who wish to exploit the power of such materials for the purposes of intimidation and/or to pursue nefarious purposes. [...] Satanic elements remain problematic realities in many situations. I remain troubled about the matter of transgenerational satanic cults.‚Äù Former ISSTD president Colin Ross has also been accused by former patients of implanting false memories, including of satanic ritual abuse. Roma Hart accused Ross of convincing her, among other things, that she was forcibly impregnated by aliens and later gave birth to a half-alien, half-human hybrid. Another former patient, Martha Ann Tyo, sued Ross and others in 1998, alleging that the defendants‚Äô methods led her to believe her family was part of an ‚Äúextended, transgenerational satanic cult.‚Äù History The US-based ISSTD was officially formed in 1984 under the name of the International Society for the Study of Multiple Personality and Dissociation but changed to the International Society for the Study of Dissociation in 1994 and then to its current name in November 2006. The organization was resolved to be founded by Myron Boor, Bennett Braun, David Caul, Jane Dubrow, George Greaves, Richard Kluft, Frank Putnam and Roberta Sachs, a group of physicians and psychologists. Its first annual conference was held in December of the same year. By the end of the 1980s, membership approached 2,000. Presidents George. B.

Starting with short promotional cartoons prior to the two World Wars, Hungarian animation underwent a sporadic and halting development during the turbulent war years which were characterized in large part by the emigration of much of the field's top talent. This exodus slowed dramatically during the 1950s when the Hungarian Communist Party took power and the Iron Curtain took shape. With Communism came nationalization of the Hungarian animation studio‚Äîa fact that was to prove a mixed blessing for the nascent industry. While political pressures would strongly dictate the kinds of topics that animation could cover in the early years, state funding meant that even the relatively small postwar nation would be able to prove itself on the international stage.Hankiss, Elem√©r. A kiv√°l√≥s√°g szigete. FilmKult√∫ra. 2000.Dizseri, Eszter. Kock√°r√≥l kock√°ra : a magyar anim√°ci√≥ kr√≥nik√°ja 1948-1998. Balassi Kiad√≥. Budapest. 1999. Indeed, subsequent to the 1956 revolution, the softening effects of Goulash Communism helped enable artists to begin to express themselves such that by the late 1970s, Pann√≥nia Film St√∫di√≥ would rank among the top 5 major cartoon studios alongside Walt Disney, Hanna-Barbera, Soyuzmultfilm, and Toei.Lendvai, Erzsi. A magyar anim√°ci√≥s film (English: \\"Animated cartoons in Hungary\\"). FilmKult√∫ra. 1996. With the end of Communism in 1989, state control of the animation industry dropped away and market forces prompted the rise of numerous independent animation studios. Lacking state funding and receiving mixed international response, Hungarian animation studios today have had to develop financing strategies consisting largely of working as production and development companies performing labor- intensive animation activities such as compositioning and inking for foreign studios. Despite this, Hungarian films continue to be produced every few years. Overview The history of Hungarian animation extends from its origin in Istv√°n Kat√≥ Kiszly's 1914 cut-out caricatures to the modern time. Although a few boldly experimental films were made in the early years, it would not be until the 1930s that actual animation studios would be formed (under figures like Gyula Macsk√°ssy and J√°nos Hal√°sz) to produce promotional material in the form of newsreels and advertisements. International conflicts during both world wars as well as turbulent political climates in the pre-Iron Curtain period led to the emigration of many of Hungary's animation artists who famously established themselves in places like France, the U.K., and America. During the Communist era, all animation efforts are nationalized first as Magyar Szinkronfilmgy√°rt√≥ V√°llalat in 1948 and later as Pann√≥nia Film St√∫di√≥ in 1959. State control of animation on the one hand constrained artistic freedom of expression while simultaneously ensuring the survival of the medium. During the 1950s, the first modern generation of Hungarian animators came to prominence, creating primarily short animations depicting the Hungarian folk tales and legends that would be a politically safe mainstay of Hungarian animation output throughout the Communist era. This generation would be responsible for creating the first colored animation. A second generation of animators would emerge in the 1960s under the less repressive system of Goulash Communism, and sociopolitical sentiment was for the first time gently hinted at as cartoons developed philosophical themes characterized by morbidity and black humor. Foreign animation studios began to reach out to Pann√≥nia Film St√∫di√≥ during this period to subcontract some of the more laborious elements of cartoon production such as compositioning and inking. This introduced the concept of cartoon series/serials, and soon a number of Hungarian serials were created introducing the country's first recognizable cartoon character stars. This period also saw the production of the first adult animation. The 1970s saw the rise of a third generation of animators even more intent on commentary on the social conditions in the country. Animations during this period were often marked by a muted subsurface emphasis on anxiety and a claustrophobic fear of persecution while the animation works of older (first and second generation) animators tended to emphasize morality and a development of the grotesque. This third generation would see the emergence of the country's first feature-length films as Pann√≥nia Film St√∫di√≥ rose to international renown as one of the top 5 major cartoon studios alongside Walt Disney, Hanna-Barbera, Soyuzmultfilm, and Toei. The 1980s would prove to be a peak of Hungarian animation efforts. Increasingly bold use of irony and allegory portrayed the Hungarian condition under Communist rule and during this period a number of Hungarian films received high accolades and prestigious awards including Ferenc Rofusz' 1981 Oscar for A L√©gy (\\"The Fly\\").Howard, Doug. Beyond the frames: Will this art survive?. Business Hungary. Vol.15, No.1. American Chamber of Commerce in Hungary. January 2001. The decade would also mark a renaissance in technical experimentation with the exploration of many non-traditional graphic media such as plasticine, sand, coal, textiles, and computer animation. During this period the first feature- length films based on serials were created and proved to be quite popular. In 1989, Communist rule was cast off and with it State control of the animation arts in 1990. Due to free market pressures, a number of independent animation studios sprang up in the wake. The novel issue of commercial financing proved to be a complex one as new studios struggled to make ends meet. A variety of solutions were adopted ranging from the active courting of foreign contract work, to specialization in the labor-intensive traditional hand-animation forms, to employee ownership. In 2002, the new Hungarian government began to take a role in the medium as well with funding from the Ministry of National Cultural Heritage going toward the development of further animations of Hungarian folk tales and legends which since the Communist era have become a source of national pride.

During the lead-up to World War II and the turbulent war years, Hungary saw an exodus of artists and filmmakers, particularly among the Hungarian Jewish population. Seeking to continue their art in less politically fraught climates, several Hungarian cartoonists began to establish studios abroad. *1914 - Istv√°n Kat√≥ Kiszly, creator of weekly news bulletins, creates Hungary's first animated film‚Äîan animated cut-out cartoon entitled Zrib √ñd√∂n.Cunningham, John.

These animations mostly consisted of title sequences and animated inserts to adapt foreign animations for Hungarian audiences. *Early 1930s - Emigre artists, Lenke Per√©nyi (better known as Madeleine Steinfield) and Vilma Kiss (variously known as Vilma de Kiss, Vilma de Kish, and Wilma de Quiche) settle in Paris to produce French animations. *1932 - Together with graphic artist F√©lix Kassowitz, Macsk√°ssy and Hal√°sz form Hungary's first animation studio, Coloriton, which existed for 4 years, producing high-quality promotion-oriented animations for television and cinema including Boldog kir√°ly kincse (\\"The Treasure of the Joyful King\\"). The three men are joined by caricaturist Ern≈ë Sz√©n√°ssy and musician Guszt√°v Ilosvay. Toward the end of Coloriton's existence, the studio expanded briefly into the UK where the daughter studio, British Colour Cartoon Films Limited, was formed under Hal√°sz' supervision. *1932 - Emigre cartoonist, Imre Hajd√∫ (better known by his stage name, Jean Image‚Äî\\"Image\\" is based upon the French pronunciation of \\"Im-Haj\\", the initial syllables of his full name) establishes himself in France to produce nearly two dozen animated films during his lifetime. *1933 - Imre T√≥th (better known as Amerigo Tot) works on an animated adaptation of Pinocchio.

He would later be granted an OBE in 1972, would become the president of ASIFA in 1979, and would play an essential role in Hungary's first three animated film festivals (KAFF events). *Late 1930s - Hungarian animation within Hungary continues through the efforts of animators like Istv√°n Balogh, Viktor K√°lm√°n, F√©lix Kassowitz, and Istv√°n Valker. During this period Valker famously creates Orosz √°lom (\\"Russian Dream\\"), Tiroli t√°nc (\\"Dance of Tyrol\\"), and Szteppt√°nc (\\"Step-Dance\\"), a series of three live action and animation pictures starring child actress, √Ågi Polly. Valker's techniques were developed independent of prior similar efforts abroad, but in Hungary the concept was considered unworkable, and the films met with poor reception. *1938-1944 - Valker creates Csavarg√≥ szerencs√©je (\\"A Vagabond's Luck\\") and, with the help of Ter√©z David, A moln√°r, a fia meg a szam√°r (\\"The Miller, The Miller's Son, and the Donkey\\"), the latter of which would be completed during the bombing campaign that preceded the 1944 Siege of Budapest.Orosz, Anna Ida and Orosz, M√°rton.

Here the couple create the politically charged A Short Vision which won critical acclaim on release in 1956. The couple live briefly in Paris before settling in Canada to produce a number of films for the National Film Board of Canada including the Oscar- nominated Hunger (1975). *1948 - All film-making is nationalized by the Hungarian Communist Party. During the next few years Macsk√°ssy worked independently within national channels to create a series of educational films including Az eg√©r √©s az oroszl√°n (\\"The Mouse and the Lion\\"), Hol az a macska?

Modern animation First generation animation Folktale animation is common and this period sees a rise in Hungarian animation establishing such animators as J√≥zsef Nepp, Attila Dargay, Tibor Cserm√°k, Gyorgy Kov√°sznai, J√≥zsef G√©mes, Szabolcs Szab√≥, Gy√∂rgy V√°rnai, Marcell Jankovics, P√©ter Szoboszlay, Zsolt Richly, S√°ndor Reisenb√ºchler, B√©la Vajda, Tam√°s Szab√≥ Sipos, J√°nos Mata, and also puppet animators like Ott√≥ Foky and Istv√°n Imre. *1941-1951 - Gyula Macsk√°ssy and Edit Fekete create the first color animation, A kiskakas gy√©m√°nt f√©lkrajc√°rja (\\"The Little Cock's Diamond Halfpenny\\").

P√°rbaj is awarded the Special Jury Prize at the 1961 Cannes Film Festival. Second-generation animation Foreign animation teams begin to reach out to Pann√≥nia Film Studio as a way to cut costs on some of the more labor-intensive aspects of cartoon production. In domestic productions, however, with the artistic community under strain from an authoritarian Communist government, morbidity and black humor become more common as cartoons were used to hint at and reflect the philosophy and conditions of the day. Due to Western influence, such cartoon serials emerged as Gyula Macsk√°ssy and Gy√∂rgy V√°rnai's Peti √©s a g√©pember (\\"Peti and the Robot\\"), Marci √©s a Cs≈ë (\\"Marci in the Jungle\\"), Vili √©s B√ºty√∂k (\\"Vili and B√ºty√∂k\\"), √úzenet a j√∂v≈ëb≈ël (\\"Messages from the Future\\"), K√©rem a k√∂vetkez≈ët!

Although state support for Hungary's one animation studio (Pann√≥nia Film St√∫di√≥) came to an end, the free market quickly prompted the development of a number of independent animation studios. In order to gain funding in the absence of the state, studios such as Kecskem√©tfilm Kft turn to employee ownership strategies while other studios work primarily as contractors for foreign markets doing work such as compositioning and inking. Yet other studios such as the American-Hungarian joint venture Studio 2 have focused instead on traditional hand-drawn cell animation techniques to preserve this now niche animation style. Among other animation studios that were founded since the withdrawal of state control are included Pann√≥nia rajzfilmgy√°rt√≥k, Videovox, Funny Film, Animex, Dana Film, Reflex, Puppet Film, Aladin st√∫di√≥, Firka, and the German-Hungarian joint venture Loonland.

The Paleo-Balkan Thracians inhabited the area in the Iron Age, and Triballians dwelled here prior to the Celtic invasion in 279 BC which established the Scordisci as masters of the region. Naissus was among the cities taken in the Roman conquest in 75 BC. The Romans built the Via Militaris in the 1st century, with Naissus being one of the key towns. Ni≈° is also notable as the birthplace of Constantine the Great, the first Christian Roman Emperor and the founder of Constantinople, as well as two other Roman emperors, Constantius III and Justinian I. It is home to one of Serbia's oldest Christian churches dating to the 4th century in the suburb of Mediana. Etymology Ni≈° (, ) was built on the ruins of Roman Naissus. The Late antiquity town was known as Naissus, ŒùŒ¨œäœÉœÉŒøœÇ, ŒùŒ±œäœÉœÉœåœÇ (Naissos), Naessus, urbs Naisitana, Navissus, Navissum, ŒùŒ±œäœÉœÉŒøœçœÄŒøŒªŒπœÇ (Naissoupolis). It originated as a hydronym (the Ni≈°ava river), either of Celtic or Paleo-Balkan linguistical origin. Its common antique name in historiography is Latin Naissus. In Old Serbian, the town was known as Ni≈° (written and ). Linguist Radoslav Katiƒçiƒá proposed that the placename Ni≈° is a Slavic and proto-Albanian toponym that evolved from the Ancient Greek ŒùŒ±ŒπœÉœÉœåœÇ. According to Katiƒçiƒá, only mediation through the Illyrian that is proto-Albanian language could give the final phonetic form as Ni≈° reflecting the sound changes that Albanian underwent and was later borrowed into Slavic, indicating that at the time of arrival by Slavs (7th century) a historic (proto)-Albanian presence existed in the area.. According to Katiƒçiƒá (1976), Nish is an Albanian and Slavic toponym that developed from Ancient Greek, which presupposes Albanian language mediation. [16] In other words, based on the strict rules of sound change the only way the Greek City ŒùŒ±ŒπœÉœÉœåœÇ (Naeisu) could have the phonetic outcome Nish (ni≈°) is via the sound changes which Albanian underwent. It was then borrowed from Albanian into Slavic. This means that when the Slavs arrived in Nish (seventh century) there would have already been a historic (proto)-Albanian presence.\\"; p. 568. \\"[16]. R.

Neolithic sites in the Ni≈° area include \\"ƒåardak\\" in Donja Vre≈æina, \\"Velika ƒçesma\\" in Vrti≈°te, \\"Kovanluk\\" in Malƒça, \\"Ciganski kljuƒç\\" in Trupale, \\"Bubanj\\" in Ni≈°, \\"ƒåivlak\\" in Gornja Toponica, and others. The Vinƒça culture which flourished in the 5th‚Äì4th millennia BC included over 18 sites in the Ni≈° area. 31 sites in the Ni≈°ava basin are dated to the Eneolithic (3200‚Äì2000 BC). Several migrations from the Black Sea steppes into the Balkans change the ethnic picture; natives and immigrants mix and result in the formation of the first Indo-Europeans in the Balkans. The Bubanj‚ÄìHum culture is found in its early phase in Pomoravlje, but not in the Ni≈° area, until bearers of Bubanj‚ÄìHum II connected to the late phase of the Baden culture arrive into the Ni≈°ava basin. Antiquity The Ni≈° area was inhabited by the Triballi, a tribe described as a specific people by ancient writers. Their ethnic affiliation is unknown, as linguistical research is inconclusive, while it is known that their territory was recognized in antiquity as Thracian, their relation to Thracians were older and stronger than that to Illyrians, and that they through history mixed with both Thracian and Illyrian elements. Scarce archaeological finds and onomastics indicate the presence of Thracian, Illyrian, Celtic and Dacian populations members in the Ni≈° area in antiquity. The Triballi inhabited the Great Morava valley in the 5th century BC. In 279 BC, during the Gallic invasion of the Balkans, the Scordisci tribe defeated the Triballi and settled their lands. At the time of the conquest of the Balkans by Rome in 168-75 BC, the Ni≈° area was used as a base for operations. Naissus was first mentioned in Roman documents near the beginning of the 2nd century CE, and was considered a place worthy of note in the Geography of Ptolemy of Alexandria. The Roman era In the early Roman period, Naissos (as Naissus) was viewed of as Dardanian territory, while onomastics show that the population was predominantly Thracian. The Romans occupied the town in the period of the \\"Dardanian War\\" (75-73 BC), and set up a legionary camp. The city (called refugia and vici in pre-Roman relation), because of its strategic position (Thracians were based to the south) developed as an important garrison and market town of the province of Moesia Superior. The Romans built the Via Militaris in the early 1st century AD, with Naissus being one of the key towns. Five roads met at Naissus, from Lissus, Serdica, Singidunum, Ratiaria and Thessalonica (through Scupi). A tombstone of a Cretan soldier under either Claudius (41-54) or Nero (54-68) stands in Naissus, indicating that auxiliary units were stationed here at that time. Cohort I Aurelia Dardanorum was based in the city. Legia IIII Scythica and VII Claudia may have briefly been stationed here. An auxiliary fort was based to the north, at present-day Ravna, called Timacum Minus. Marcus Aurelius (161‚Äì180) promoted the city to municipia status. Overall, several family tombstones indicate that this was an important military region and by the 3rd century a social class of peasants and soldiers emerged. At the latest, a praetorium (road-station) was established under Septimius Severus (193-211) for Imperial officials business travelling, administered by stratores of Upper Moesia. In 268, during the \\"Crisis of the third century\\" when the Empire almost collapsed, the greatest Gothic invasion seen to date came pouring into the Balkans. The Goths' seaborne allies, the Heruli, supplied a fleet, carrying vast armies down the coast of the Black Sea where they ravaged coastal territories in Thrace and Macedonia. Other huge forces crossed the Danube in Moesia. An invasion of Goths into the province of Pannonia led to disaster. In 268, the Emperor Gallienus won some important initial victories on land and at sea, but it was his successor Claudius II who finally defeated the invaders at the Battle of Naissus in 268, one of the bloodiest battles of the 3rd century. The invaders allegedly left thirty to fifty thousand dead on the field. Four years later in 272, the son of a military commander Constantius Chlorus and an innkeeper's daughter called Flavia Iulia Helena was born in Naissus who was destined to rule as Emperor Constantine the Great. Constantine created the Dacia mediterranea province of which Naissus was capital, which also had Naissus and Remesiana of the Via militaris and the towns of Pautalia and Germania. He lived at Naissus in short periods from 316‚Äì322. The Roman Emperor Julian the Apostate (360-363) resided in Naissus briefly in 361, prior to becoming the sole Augustus. A fabricae that produced ingots (Gold bars) was active in Naissus at the time of Theodosius I (378-395) as findings with the marking of NAISI made on the order of the Emperor have been found in Romania, dating to 379. Mosaics in Mediana The 4th-century Imperial villa at Mediana is an important archaeological site located close to Ni≈°. Mosaic floors and other traces of luxury are preserved in the archaeological museum on the site. Other aristocratic suburban villas are clustered nearby. Historians think that city of Naissus could have had 150,000 citizens. Here in Mediana, in 364, emperors Valentinian and Valens divided the Roman empire and ruled as co-emperors. The 4th-century Christian basilica in Ni≈° is one of the oldest Christian monuments. The Roman Emperor Constantius III (421) who was the power behind the throne during much of the 410s was born in Naissus. > \\"'\\" Priscus on Naissus in 448 A.D. Though the emperor Julian strengthened the walls, the very prosperity of Naissus made it a target and it was destroyed by Attila in 443. Attila the Hun conquered Naissus by using battering rams and mobile siege towers‚Äîmilitary sophistication that was new in the Hun repertory. After the Huns captured the city of Naissus they massacred the inhabitants of the city. Years later, river banks outside the city were still covered with human bones as a reminder of the devastation the Huns had inflicted. Priscus said \\"When we arrived at Naissus we found the city deserted, as though it had been sacked; only a few sick persons lay in the churches. We halted at a short distance from the river, in an open space, for all the ground adjacent to the bank was full of the bones of men slain in war.\\" The founder of the Justinian Dynasty, Justin I, was born in Naissus in 450, and his nephew Justinian I did his best to restore the city, but Naissus never recovered its 4th century urbanity. The Roman fort at Balajnac with a well-preserved cistern produced coins for Justinian I. Justinian established the Archbishopric of Justiniana Prima which the town and its bishopric became part of, Procopius mentioned it as Naissopolis. –õ–∏–ø–∞–¥–∞—Ä–∏—ò—É–º 10.jpg|A lapidarium.

During the 6th and 7th century, Slavic tribes made eight attempts to take Ni≈°. In 551, the Slavs crossed Ni≈° initially headed for Thessalonica, but ended up in Dalmatia.BG III 40 By the 580s the Slavs had conquered Serbia to much of northern Greece.The New Cambridge Medieval History: c. 500-c. 700, p. 539 During the final attack in 615 the invaders took the city, and most of the Roman and Romanized Daco- Thracian population fled, perished, or became assimilated. The Slavs in the Sclaviniae remain independent for some while; in 785, Macedonia is conquered by Constantine VI. In 805, the town and its surroundings were taken by Bulgarian ruler Krum and became part of Bulgarian Empire. High Middle Ages In 1018, the Theme of Bulgaria was established by Emperor Basil II, who had conquered Bulgaria and Serbia. Ni≈° was one of its main cities.Alexandru Madgearu, Byzantine Military Organization on the Danube, 10th-12th Centuries, East Central and Eastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 450-1450; BRILL, 2013, , p. 99 Prince Constantine Bodin was crowned Emperor of Bulgaria in 1072, amid the Bulgarian revolt against the Byzantine Empire. Bodin conquered Ni≈°, but was later captured.Byzantium's Balkan frontier, p. 142 During the People's Crusade, on July 3, 1096, Peter the Hermit clashed with Byzantine forces at Ni≈°, losing a quarter of his men, but managed to march on to Constantinople. The Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143‚Äì1180) had the town fortified, and in 1155, handed the region of Dendra (Ni≈° and its environ) over to Prince Desa, as an appanage.The Late Medieval Balkans, p. 4 In 1162, Manuel I met with Stefan Nemanja at Ni≈°, where Nemanja was given the region of Duboƒçica (Leskovac) alongside Ni≈°. By 1188, Ni≈° had become Nemanja's capital.The Late Medieval Balkans, p. 7 On 27 July 1189, Nemanja received Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and his 100,000 crusaders at Ni≈°.The Late Medieval Balkans, p. 24 When describing Serbia during the rule of Vukan II in 1202, the mention of Ni≈° shows its special status.The Late Medieval Balkans, p. 48 In 1203, Kaloyan of Bulgaria annexed Ni≈°.The Late Medieval Balkans, p. 54 Stefan Nemanjiƒá later regained the region.

The fall of the Serbian state decided the fate of Ni≈° as well. After the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, even though Serbia existed much weakened as a semi-independent state for another 70 years, the Constantinople- Vienna road grew deserted. In 1443, Ni≈° fell into the hands of Ludanjin. The town itself was given back to the Serbs, while Brankoviƒá gave it over to ƒêorƒëe Mrnjavƒçeviƒá. In the so-called Long Campaign, Christian armies, led by the Hungarian military leader Janos Hunyadi (known as Sibinjanin Janko in Serbian folk poetry) together with Serbian Despot ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá, defeated the Turks and pushed them back to Sofia. An important battle was fought near Ni≈°. The crusaders led by John Hunyadi,Hupchick, Dennis P., The Balkans: From Constantinople to Communism, (Palgrave Macmillan, 2004), 117. captured Ottoman stronghold Ni≈° and defeated three armies of the Ottoman Empire. After this battle, which was part of Hunyadi's expedition known as the long campaign, Ni≈° remained under the control of Serbian Despotate. The Ottoman era Ni≈° succumbed to Ottoman rule again in 1448 and remained thus for the following 241 years. During period of Ottoman rule, Ni≈° was a seat of the Sanjak of Ni≈° and Ni≈° Eyalet. Ni≈° Fortress, built in that period, still represents one of the most beautiful and best preserved edifices in the Balkans. The extant fortification is of Turkish origin, dating from the first decades of the 18th century (1719‚Äì1723). It is well known as one of the most significant and best preserved monuments of this kind in the Central Balkans. The Fortress was erected on the site of earlier fortifications - the ancient Roman, Byzantine, and later yet Medieval forts. The Fortress has a polygonal ground plan, eight bastion terraces and four massive gates. It stretches over 22 ha of land. The rampart walls are 2,100 m long, 8 m high and with an average thickness of 3 m thick. The building stone, brought from the nearby quarries, was hewn into rather evenly shaped blocks. The inside of the rampart wall was additionally fortified by a wooden construction, 'santraƒç', and an additional bulwark, 'trpanac'. On the outside, the Fortress was surrounded by a wide moat, whose northern part has been preserved to this day. Beside the massive stone rampart walls, the southern Stambol gate and the western Belgrade gate are pretty well preserved. Partly preserved are the water gates, while the northern Vidin gate and the south-east Jagodina gate are preserved only as remains. With a complete reconstruction of all the gates, the Ni≈° Fortress would once again become, architecturally and functionally, a closed fortification system. On September 24, 1689, the Austrian army took the city after defeating the Turks at the Battle of Ni≈°, but the Ottomans retook it the next year. In 1737, it was seized again by the Austrian army, in their campaign against the Turks. The war ended in 1739. The Serbian Revolution (1804‚Äì17) The Serbian rebel leader Karaƒëorƒëe, in his talks with the representatives of Russia, as well as in his talks with Napoleon and the Turks, pointed out that Ni≈° had to belong to Serbia, stressing it crucial for the renewal of the Serbian state. The Serbian rebels headed towards Ni≈° in order to take it over and continue towards their next goal, Old Serbia. Karaƒëorƒëe's suggestion was to use the whole army to liberate Ni≈°, while the rest of the commanders demanded to attack Ni≈° from four different points, which was accepted. On 27 April 1809, the Serbian rebel army with its 16,000 soldiers approached the villages of Kamenica, Gornji and Donji Matejevac, near the town of Ni≈° with Miloje Petroviƒá as Commander-in-chief. The Serbian rebels made six trenches. The first and biggest was on ƒåegar Hill under vojvoda Stevan Sinƒëeliƒá. The second one was in Gornji Matejevac under Petar Dobrnjac. The third trench was north- east to Kamenica, under vojvoda Ilija Barjaktareviƒá. The fourth trench was in Kamenica under Miloje Petroviƒá. The fifth trench was in the mountain above Kamenica and under the control of vojvoda Pauljo Matejiƒá, while the sixth one was made in Donji Matejevac. Miloje Petroviƒá's request to attack Ni≈° directly was not accepted. The rebels were told to wait while the town was being besieged. Meanwhile, the Turkish army was reinforced with 20,000 soldiers from Adrianople, Thessalonica, Vranje and Leskovac. The Turks attacked the trench of Petar Dobrnjac on 30 May, while the following day, the ƒåegar Hill trench under Sinƒëeliƒá was attacked. The battle lasted all day. As Milovan Kukiƒá testified, the Turks attacked five times, and the Serbs managed to repulse them five times. Each time their losses were great. Some of the Turks attacked, and some of them went ahead, and thus when they attacked for the sixth time they filled the trenches with their dead so that those alive went over their dead bodies and they began to fight against the Serbs with their rifles, cutting and sticking in their enemies with their sabres and knives. The Serbian soldiers from other trenches cried out to help Stevan. But there was no help, either because they could not help without their cavalry, or because Miloje Petroviƒá did not allow it. A wall of the Skull Tower a unique monument in Europe. When Sinƒëeliƒá saw that the Turks had taken over the trench, he ran to the powder cave, took out his gun and fired at the powder magazine. The explosion was so strong that all the surrounding area was shaken, and the whole trench was caught in a cloud of dense smoke. Stevan Sinƒëeliƒá, who up to that moment had reached everywhere, helping and encouraging everybody, was blown up.\\" Three thousand Serbian soldiers and more than twice as many on the Turkish side were killed on ƒåegar Hill. An important Serbian monument is the Skull Tower, a tower which contains the human skulls of dead Serbian rebels in its construction, a monument unique in its design. The Modern period (1817‚Äì1918) In the 19th century the area was one of the centres of Bulgarian National Revival. The French J√©r√¥me-Adolphe Blanqui, when travelling across the Balkans in 1841, describes the population of the Sanjak of Ni≈° as Bulgarians.J√©r√¥me-Adolphe Blanqui, ‚ÄûVoyage en Bulgarie pendant l'ann√©e 1841‚Äú (–ñ–µ—Ä–æ–º-–ê–¥–æ–ª—Ñ –ë–ª–∞–Ω–∫–∏. –ü—ä—Ç—É–≤–∞–Ω–µ –∏–∑ –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏—è –ø—Ä–µ–∑ 1841 –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–∞. –ü—Ä–µ–≤. –æ—Ç —Ñ—Ä–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏ –ï–ª. –†–∞–π—á–µ–≤–∞, –ø—Ä–µ–¥–≥. –ò–≤. –ò–ª—á–µ–≤. –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è: –ö–æ–ª–∏–±—Ä–∏, 2005, 219 —Å. .) The author describes the population of Sanjak of Ni≈° as ethnic Bulgarians. In 1870, Ni≈° was included in the Bulgarian Exarchate.Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire Facts on File library of world history, G√°bor √Ågoston, Bruce Alan Masters, Infobase Publishing, 2009 , P. 104. The city was also stipulated as the area to be ceded to Bulgaria according to the Constantinople Conference in 1876.Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire; Gabor Agoston, Bruce Alan Masters; 2009, p. 104 Serbian author Milan Savic in his book \\"History of the Bulgarian people until the end of its state\\" issued in Novi Sad wrote, that at his time (1878) Nis and environs were Bulgarian populated. The urban Muslim population of Ni≈° consisted mainly of Turks, of which a part were of Albanian origin, and the rest were Muslim Albanians and Muslim Romani. In the 1841, after a failed uprising, some 10,000 people fled the Ni≈° region into Serbia.Jovan Cvijiƒá, Balkansko poluostrvo i ju≈ænoslovenske zemlje /Balkan Peninsula and South Slav Countries/ (Belgrade: Zavod za izdavanje ud≈æbenika, 1966), pp. 151-152. In 1861, Midhat Pasha was put in charge of the Ni≈° Eyalet. He was a reformer influenced by Western ideas and the eyalet became a showpiece of the reformist movement. He tackled the problems of communications and security: he set up a system of block-houses to stop the incursion of armed bands from Serbia. According to his laudatory son's biography of him, \\"he organized a gendarmerie, secured the peaceful collection of taxes, and put an end to all religious persecution.\\" He also established schools and hospitals for members of all religious groups without discrimination. Midhat's reforms were so successful that they inspired a reworking of the Ottoman system. In 1864, the council of state decided that the eyalets would be replaced by larger vilayets. At each of these main levels of rule, there would be mixed Muslim- Christian councils. The first of the vilayets was run for a time by Midhat Pasha and it included the former Ni≈° Eyalet and much of Bulgaria and was called the \\"Danube Vilayet.\\" In the next three years, he carried out an extensive programme of school-building and other public works, as well as introducing a provincial newspaper. Photograph of the Ni≈° Committee swearing oath, 24 September 1874. On February 24, 1874, the \\"Serbian Liberation Committee for the Sanjak of Ni≈°\\", known simply as the Ni≈° Committee, was founded and organized by Kole Ra≈°iƒá, Todor Milovanoviƒá, Dimitrije ƒêorƒëeviƒá, Milan Noviƒçiƒá, Tasko Tasa Uzunoviƒá, ƒêorƒëe Pop-Maniƒá, Mihajlo Bo≈æidarac, and Todor Stankoviƒá. They gathered at Bo≈æidarac's house, and Orthodox priest Petar Ikonomoviƒá swore Oath on the Christian cross and Gospel, reminiscent of the Ora≈°ac Assembly (1804). The Ni≈° Committee's plan was a systematic action, through local uprisings weaken the Ottomans, and with gradual arming of the people help liberate the region. Kole Ra≈°iƒá was declared vojvoda. Ni≈° was eventually incorporated into Serbia during the wider Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878) and the Serbian Army entered Ni≈° on 11 January 1878. During the Serbian‚ÄìOttoman War (1876‚Äì1878) the Albanian neighbourhood was burned to the ground and some of the Muslim population of Ni≈° fled to the Ottoman vilayet of Kosovo resettling in Pristina where they dominated trade, while others went to Skopje. para. 6. \\"According to the information about the language spoken among the Muslims in the cities, we can see of which nationality they were. So, the Muslim population of Ni≈° and Pirot consisted mostly of Turks; para. 11. \\"The Turks were mostly city dwellers. It is certain, however, that part of them was of Albanian origin, because of the well-known fact that the Albanians were very easily assimilated with Turks in the cities.\\"; para. 23, 30, 49. \\"This was the year that saw Serbia expanding southward and taking Nis. The Albanian quarter was burned down and Albanians from the surrounding villages forced to flee.\\" The number of remaining Muslims counted were 1,168, with many being Muslim Romani, out of the pre-war ca. 8,500. \\"that the Muslim Albanians of Nish were forced to leave in 1878, and that at that time most of these Nishan Albanians migrated south into Kosovo, although some went to Skopje in Macedonia.\\" The demographics of Ni≈° underwent change whereby Serbs who formed half the urban population prior to 1878 became 80 percent in 1884. \\"Prior to 1878, the Serbs comprised not more than one half of the population of Nis, the largest city in the region; by 1884 the Serbian share rose to 80 per cent.\\" In the following years, the city saw rapid development. City library was founded in 1879,and its first clerk was Stevan Sremac. The first hotel, Europe, was built in 1879; a hospital and the first bank started operating in 1881. The City hall was built from 1882 to 1887. In 1883, Kosta ƒåenda≈° established the first printing house. In 1884, the first newspaper in the city Ni≈°ki vesnik was started. In 1884 Jovan Apel built a brewery. A railway line to Ni≈° was built in 1884, as well as the city's railway station; on 8 August 1884, the first train arrived from Belgrade. Since 1885, Ni≈° was the last station of the Orient Express, until the railroad was built between Ni≈° and Sofia in 1888. In 1887 Mihailo Dimiƒá founded the \\"Ni≈° Theatre Sinƒëeliƒá.\\" In 1897 Mita Ristiƒá founded the Nitex textile factory. In 1905 the painter Nade≈æda Petroviƒá established the Siƒáevo art colony. The first film was screened in 1897, and the first permanent cinema started operating in 1905. The hydroelectric dam in Siƒáevo Gorge on Ni≈°ava was built in 1908; at the time, it was the largest in Serbia. The airfield was built in 1912 on the Trupale field, and the first aeroplane arrived on 29 December 1912. City Museum was founded in 1913, hosting archaeological, ethnographic and art collections. The first airplane (a Bl√©riot XI) ever flown over Ni≈° in 1912. During the First Balkan War, Ni≈° was the seat of The Main Headquarters of Serbian Army, which led military operations against the Ottoman Empire. In World War I, Ni≈° was the wartime capital of Serbia, hosting the Government and the National Assembly, until the Central Powers conquered Serbia in November 1915. After the breakthrough of the Thessaloniki Front, the First Serbian Army commanded by general Petar Bojoviƒá liberated Ni≈° on October 12, 1918. Contemporary history Bubanj WW2 Memorial Park. In the first few years after the war, Ni≈° was recovering from the damage. The tram system in Ni≈° started to run in November 1930. The national airline Aeroput included Ni≈° as a regular destination for the route Belgrade‚ÄîNi≈°‚ÄîSkopje‚ÄîThessaloniki in 1930. During the time of German occupation in World War II, the first Nazi concentration camp in Yugoslavia was located near Ni≈°. On February 12, 1942, 147 prisoners staged a mass escape. In 1944 the city was heavily bombed by the Allies.

A coalition of democratic opposition parties called Zajedno (Together) won the local elections in Ni≈° in 1996. The first democratic mayor of the City of Ni≈° was Zoran ≈Ωivkoviƒá, who later became the Prime Minister of Serbia in 2003. On May 7, 1999 it was the site of the NATO Cluster bombing of Ni≈° that resulted in many civilian casualties and no military losses. During the local elections held in September 2004, Smiljko Kostiƒá of Nova Srbija was elected as mayor. The democratic party provoked a referendum to recall Kostiƒá in November 2005.

It is located east of the town of Sumedang. Construction on the dam began in 2008 and it was completed in 2015. The power station is expected to be commissioned in 2019. The primary purpose of the dam is irrigation but it will also provide for flood control, water supply and hydroelectric power generation. Water in the reservoir will be used to help irrigate of farmland and the power station is expected to have a 110 MW capacity. The project has been become controversial, primarily due to the relocation of people in the future reservoir zone.Arya Dipa, 'Jokowi's social impact policy on Jatigede dam rejected', The Jakarta Post, 24 January 2015. Background The dam was first proposed in 1963 after a study of the Cimanuk was carried out by Coyne et Bellier. Further planning and designs commenced thereafter. An environmental impact assessment was completed in 1986 and land acquisition study in 2003. After decades of planning and protests, the Indonesian Government announced firm plans to proceed with the dam in 2004. The project has been surrounded with controversy over the years, particularly as its reservoir would flood of land. This includes five districts and 30 villages which include approximately 70,000 people to be relocated. Affected residents claim that compensation for their land is too low and that the government intimidated them to accept offers in the 1980s. In addition, a 2011 study by Indonesia's Ministry of Public Works estimated that the reservoir would become ineffective in 50 years due to high sedimentation of the river. Despite the controversy, the government stated in 2004 that an agreement had been reached. The contract to build the dam and power plant was awarded to China's Sinohydro Corporation in May 2007. Construction on the dam's diversion tunnel began in October 2008 and was completed in August 2011. The government announced in late 2011 that that dam was 60% complete. In July 2011, it was announced that Perusahaan Listrik Negara would oversee the construction and operation of the 110 MW power plant. The dam and power plant is expected to cost US$224 million. In May 2013 the government announced that the total cost would be around $400 million and that the dam was 70% complete.Nurfika Osman, 'Jatigede Dam to be operational by 2014', The Jakarta Post, 18 May 2013. Currently, the dam was expected to start impounding its reservoir in early 2015. This major step in construction has been repeatedly delayed due to resident relocations. In December 2014, a contract was signed with Sinohydro to construct the power station. It should be operational in 2019. On 31 August 2015, the dam began to impound its reservoir, 30 days behind the most recent schedule. Design The Jatigede Dam will be a high and long rock-fill embankment dam. Its crest will be wide and the body will contain of fill. The dam's spillway will be a chute-type on the center of the downstream face. It will be controlled by four radial gates and have a discharge capacity of . The irrigation intake will be located below the spillway. The dam will withhold a reservoir with a storage capacity of which is active (or 'usable') for water supply and power generation. The reservoir's catchment area encompasses while the man-made lake will have a surface area of . The dam's crest elevation will be and the normal reservoir elevation . The intake for the power plant will be on the right abutment and will place water into a long head-race tunnel before reaching the power plant downstream. The power plant will contain two 55 MW Francis turbine-generators (total capacity 110 MW) with a design hydraulic head of .

His imprisonment attracted protest from several human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, which named him a prisoner of conscience. Prior to his arrest, D√≠az Hern√°ndez was executive director of the Cooperativa Avile√±a de Periodistas Independientes (CAPI), an independent news agency that sought to challenge the state monopoly on news. Censorship in Cuba is commonplace, with its media under the supervision of the Communist Party's Department of Revolutionary Orientation. In 2006, The Committee to Protect Journalists named it the seventh most censored nation in the world, and the 2011 Freedom of the Press report of the press NGO Freedom House named it the most censored country in the Americas. As a journalist unaligned with the government, D√≠az Hern√°ndez reportedly suffered repeated threats and harassment, including an \\"acto de repudio\\" (\\"act of repudiation\\") in which he was subjected to public criticism for his \\"counterrevolutionary\\" views. In 1997, he was briefly detained by police, and the following year, he was attacked in the street following a meeting of independent journalists. On 18 January 1999, D√≠az Hern√°ndez was arrested, and in a trial the following day, convicted of \\"dangerousness\\", defined by the Cuban penal code as \\"the special proclivity of a person to commit crimes as demonstrated by behaviour that manifestly contradicts the norms of socialist morals\\". He had previously received six warnings on the charge. Human Rights Watch reported that the court based its verdict on evidence that D√≠az Hern√°ndez had met with delinquents and disturbed the public order. He was sentenced to four years' imprisonment in Canaleta Prison in Mor√≥n. Both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International criticized his trial as unfair, stating that his lawyer did not have sufficient time to prepare a defense. The latter organization named D√≠az Hern√°ndez a prisoner of conscience, calling for his immediate release. His arrest was also criticized by The Committee to Protect Journalists, who alleged that it was part of a broad \\"crackdown\\" on the non- government aligned press, and by Reporters Without Borders, who wrote to Fidel Castro to demand his release. D√≠az Hern√°ndez himself went on hunger strike to protest his detention for the first ten days of his imprisonment. D√≠az Hern√°ndez was released in January 2001. He briefly returned to his work with CAPI, but fearing that another arrest was imminent, he emigrated to the US in March 2002. He was granted asylum and settled in Fort Worth, Texas.

Berg, produced by Peter Jackson and Damien Echols, and released in the US by Sony Pictures Classics to critical acclaim. It received a nomination for Best Documentary Screenplay from the Writers Guild of America. Background As with the Paradise Lost film and its two sequels, West of Memphis follows the events of the West Memphis Three, a case in which three teenagers (Jessie Misskelley, Damien Echols and Jason Baldwin) were arrested for the murders of three 8-year-old children. The West Memphis Three were subsequently convicted of murder and remained in prison for more than 18 years. West of Memphis focuses on Terry Hobbs, stepfather of Stevie Branch, one of the victims of the 1993 crime, as a potential suspect due to physical evidence linking him to the crime, a history of violent behavior and his lack of an alibi for the time the murders were committed, as well as damaging statements made by his ex-wife, former neighbors, and most recently his own nephew, who claims Hobbs confessed to him. The film reveals that inexplicably Terry Hobbs was not interviewed by police at the time of the murders. Since the 1996 release of the HBO Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky documentary, Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills, supporters protested the innocence of the West Memphis Three. Much like the Paradise Lost films, West of Memphis chronicles the history of the imprisoned men all the way up to the eventual release through interviews conducted with lawyers, judges, journalists, family members, witnesses, and the West Memphis Three themselves. With the January 2012 HBO premiere of the third Paradise Lost film, Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory, there were two documentary films on the subject within a year. West of Memphis premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2012, at the Deauville American Film Festival on September 2, 2012, and at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2012. Critical reception Writing in The Wall Street Journal, film critic Joe Morgenstern described West of Memphis as \\"a devastating account of police incompetence, civic hysteria and prosecutorial behavior that was totally at odds with a vastly persuasive body of evidence uncovered in a privately funded investigation\\". Director Amy Berg, wrote Morgenstern, \\"has a dramatist's eye for what was irretrievably lost -- the innocent lives of the children, plus 18 years of three other innocent lives. And she saw, equally well, what was there to be gained: dramatic new insights into an inexorable progression from random arrests through groundless supposition, fevered conjecture and flagrant perjury to official disgrace in a supposedly airtight case.\\" Film critic Philip French of The Observer called West of Memphis \\"riveting\\", and a \\"shocking indictment of the American criminal justice system and a tribute to the dedication of selfless civil rights lawyers and their supporters from all over the world\\". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an \\"A-\\" and wrote that it \\"casts a hypnotic spell all its own. It artfully sketches out the events for anyone who's coming in cold, but basically, its strategy is to take what we already know and go deeper. ... West of Memphis goes after another possible suspect, Terry Hobbs, who was stepfather to one of the victims and who has denied any involvement. In doing so, the film reframes the story's terrible darkness, even if it can't give us the closure we hunger for.\\" Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a perfect four star rating, writing: \\"Do we need a fourth film? Yes, I think we do. If you only see one of them, this is the one to choose, because it has the benefit of hindsight.\\" See also * Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills, the original 1996 film on the trial of the West Memphis Three * Paradise Lost 2: Revelations, which follows up on the appeals and post-trial controversy * Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory, which was supposed to follow the West Memphis Three as they remained in prison, but was changed to their release after the West Memphis Three were released from prison * Devil's Knot, a 2014 fictionalized retelling of the events around the West Memphis Three  References  External links   * Category:2012 films Category:2012 documentary films Category:American films Category:American documentary films Category:New Zealand films Category:New Zealand documentary films Category:English-language films Category:Films about lawyers Category:Films directed by Amy J.

In 2009 however, J.K. Tucker and M.J. Tenorio proposed a classification system for the over 600 recognized species that were in the family. Their classification proposed 3 distinct families and 82 genera for the living species of cone snails, including the family Conilithidae. This classification was based upon shell morphology, radular differences, anatomy, physiology, cladistics, with comparisons to molecular (DNA) studies. Published accounts of genera within the Conidae (or Conilithidae) that include the genus Lilliconus include J.K. Tucker & M.J. Tenorio (2009), and Bouchet et al. (2011).Bouchet P., Kantor Yu.I., Sysoev A. & Puillandre N. (2011). \\"A new operational classification of the Conoidea\\". Journal of Molluscan Studies 77: 273-308. Testing in order to try to understand the molecular phylogeny of the Conidae was initially begun by Christopher Meyer and Alan Kohn,Interview of Professor Alan Kohn, Professor Emeritus, Zoology and is continuing, particularly with the advent of nuclear DNA testing in addition to mDNA testing. However, in 2011, some experts still use the traditional classification, where all species are placed in Conus within the single family Conidae: for example, according to the current November 2011 version of the World Register of Marine Species, all species within the family Conidae are in the genus Conus. The binomial names of species in the 82 cone snail genera listed in Tucker & Tenorio 2009 are recognized by the World Register of Marine Species as \\"alternative representations.\\" http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=14107 Classification: Traditionally, all cone shells have been included in the Linnaean genus Conus.

In WoRMS, we currently still recognize a single family Conidae (following Puillandre et al. 2011), but Tucker & Tenorio's 80 genera classification is presented as \\"alternative representation\\".

Carta Geologica d‚ÄôItalia L. Guerrieri and E. Vittori (Editors), Servizio Geologico d‚ÄôItalia, Dipartimento Difesa del Suolo, APAT, Rome, Italy, 74. is a seismic scale used for measuring the intensity of an earthquake on the basis of the effects of the earthquake on the natural environment (Earthquake Environmental Effects). The international effort to develop a new scale of macroseismic intensity that would focus exclusively on environmental effects of earthquakes began in the early 1990s and was sponsored by the International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA). After the final draft of the scale was approved by INQUA at its XVII Congress in Cairns, Australia, in 2007, the scale became officially known as ESI 2007. Like many other intensity scales, ESI 2007 uses the basic structure of twelve degrees of seismic intensity and is designed for application during field surveys immediately after the seismic event. However, the definitions of intensity degrees in ESI 2007 are based on the observation of distribution and size of environmental effects produced by an earthquake. This approach makes ESI 2007 a unique diagnostic tool for the assessment of seismic intensity levels X to XII in sparsely populated and uninhibited areas where earthquake effects on people and built environment may not be easily observed.The definitions of traditional intensity scales are based primarily on the observation of effects on humans and animals as well as damages to buildings and structures. Therefore they are difficult to apply in earthquake-affected areas where such objects of observation are absent or scarce‚Äîthe problem, which the Environmental Seismic Intensity scale is designed to overcome. For intensity level IX or lower, the ESI 2007 scale is intended to be used as a supplement to other intensity scales. a) the Definition of intensity degrees on the basis of Earthquake Environmental Effects; b) the Guidelines, which aim at better clarifying i) the background of the scale and the scientific concepts that support the introduction of such a new macroseismic scale; ii) the procedure to use the scale alone or integrated with damage-based, traditional scales; iii) how the scale is organized; iv) the descriptions of diagnostic features required for intensity assessment, and the meaning of idioms, colors, and fonts. Since 2007, the scale has been applied to modern, historical and paleoearthquakes in the frame of the INQUA TERPRO Commission on Paleoseismology and Active tectonics.

Afterwards he was a schoolteacher for three years at the college in Agen. In 1869 he obtained his doctorate in natural sciences, later replacing Lacaze-Duthiers at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure (1872). In 1876 he attained the chair of Natural History (mollusks, worms and zoophytes) at the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle, and in 1879 became chairman of the Soci√©t√© zoologique de France. In the early 1880s he participated in a series of sea expeditions, during which, he performed investigations of marine life located within the benthic zone, subsequently gaining international recognition as a specialist of marine fauna. In 1892 he became a member of the Acad√©mie des sciences, and even though he wasn't a doctor of medicine, he became a member of the Acad√©mie nationale de m√©decine (1898). From 1900 to 1919 he was director of the museum of natural history, where during the same time period (1903), he succeeded Henri Filhol (1843‚Äì1902) as chair of comparative anatomy. Perrier was deeply interested in the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. In 1909 he was speaker at the inauguration of Lamarck's monument at the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle. He believed Lamarck to be the true founder in regards to the theory of evolution.

Yahya ibn Umar was the first emir of the Almoravids in the mid-11th century, a movement he constructed in collaboration with the religious leader Abdallah ibn Yasin. Yahya led the Almoravid armies in their first campaigns, including captures of Sijilmassa and Awdaghost in 1054/55, but was himself killed in battle against a dissident Berber faction in the Adrar. Yahya was succeeded as Almoravid emir by his brother, Abu Bakr ibn Umar.  Background  In the 11th century, the Sanhaja were divided into several tribes - the Lamtuna, the Massufa, the Banu Warith and the Gudala (or Judala). After their conversion to Islam during the 9th, the Sanhaja desert tribes were united and, with the zeal of neophyte converts, launched a series of campaigns against the \\"Sudanese\\" (pagan black peoples of sub-Saharan Africa).Lewicki (1988:p.160-61; 1992: p.308-09) The Sanhaja union carved out a vast Saharan desert empire. After the Sanhaja union collapsed, most of their old dominions - particularly the citadels, caravan stops and oases on the lucrative trans-Saharan trade routes - were lost to the Ghana Empire to the south, and to the Zenata Maghrawa rulers of Sijilmassa to the north. The chronicles trace Yahya's lineage back to the Lamtuna chieftain Turgut ibn Wartasin (by full patronymic record, Yahya ibn Umar ibn Ibrahim (alias Talagagin) ibn Turgut ibn Wartasin al-Lamtuni See N. Levtzion and J.F.P. Hopkins, 2000, editors, Corpus of Early Arabic Sources for West African History, University of Ghana, p.409. Like many of the leading Lamtuna chieftains, Yahya ibn Umar longed to recreate the old Sanhaja union and recover their lost dominions. The opportunity seemed to arise in the late 1040s, after the death of Yahya ibn Ibrahim, the chieftain of the neighboring Godala tribe, and high chief of the Sanhaja confederation. The desert Sanhaja had matrilineal succession rules, and Yahya ibn Umar's mother was a Godala princess. Although only one of several candidates, Yahya ibn Umar succeeded in being elected the new high Sanhaja chief, a selection which provoked the resentment of the Godala, who had hoped for one of their own. Ibn Umar's succession was endorsed by Abdallah ibn Yasin, a Maliki jurist and fiery puritan preacher, who had been staying as a guest of the Gudala, and it is possibly on account of this that Ibn Yasin was expelled by the Gudala.Messier (2010:p.10) Probably sensing the useful organizing power of Ibn Yasin's pious fervor, Yahya ibn Umar invited him to stay among the Lamtuna. Yahya attached himself closely to Ibn Yasin, and a productive relationship was forged between the two men. Invoking stories of the early life of the Prophet Muhammad, Ibn Yasin preached that conquest was a necessary addendum to Islamicization, that it was not enough merely to adhere to God's law, but necessary to also destroy opposition to it. And tribalism, Ibn Yasin declared, was against God's law. Therefore, it is the religious duty of Muslims to set aside their tribal differences, and establish a new polity under the Sacred Law. For Yahya ibn Umar and the Lamtuna chieftains, Ibn Yasin's ideology dovetailed into their long desire to recreate their old Saharan empire, giving their worldly ambitions the legitimacy of Islamic authority and religious imperative.  Almoravid emir  Ibn Yasin and Yahya collaborated in the leadership of this new movement - soon to be called \\"the Almoravids\\". Abdallah ibn Yasin was the religious imam and ideological leader of the movement, Yahya ibn Umar the overall military commander, and thus the first Almoravid emir. Chronicler Qadi Ayyad claims that Yahya ibn Umar was the first to use the title amir al- muslimin (\\"Prince of the Muslims\\"), that would thereafter be used by Almoravid rulers.See translation of al-Qadi Iyad (Ch. 26 of Levtzion and Hopkins, 2000, p.102) Fired up by religious fervor, in the early 1050s, the Lamtuna launched a series of campaigns against the neighboring tribes to persuade them - by force if need be - to join the new Sanhaja union. Under Yahya's leadership, the Lamtuna armies successfully brought the other Sanhaja desert tribes - the Massufa, the Banu Warith and even the wary Gudala - over to the new \\"cause\\". Once united, the Almoravids set about seizing the old trans-Saharan routes and stations. But their rivals were not about to cede control so readily. The Zenata Maghrawa rulers of Sijilmassa pulled on their connections and clients in the desert to spoil the Almoravid efforts to unite the Sanhaja. After various entanglements with client armies, Yahya soon determined that the best strategy was to strike the troublemaker behind the troublemakers. In 1054 (or 1055), Yahya led his desert Sanhaja armies against Sijilmassa, defeated the Maghrawa lord and captured the city. The fall of opulent and powerful Sijilmassa to a makeshift army of rustic desert puritans was unexpected and shocked many contemporaries. With Sijilmassa apparently under control, Yahya turned his army south and headed against the Ghana empire. The Almoravids seized the critical citadel of Awdaghost on the southern end of the trans- Saharan route. But news soon arrived that the Zenata had recovered Sijilmassa and expelled the Almoravid garrison. Yahya determined on a forced march back north to recover the city, but the Godala suddenly decided to call it quits, and broke away from the Almoravid coalition. This presented Yahya with the troubling prospect of a hostile force to his rear if he pressed on north. In a fateful decision, the Almoravids decided to partition their forces - Yahya would lead a campaign against the lands of the Gudala (littoral Mauritania) and drag them back by force into the union, while instructing his brother Abu Bakr to take a holding force north and keep the Zenata of Sijilmassa in check.  Battle of Tabfarilla  Yahya headed as far as the Almoravid frontier fortress of Azuggi, in the Adrar Plateau of central Mauritania. Feeling he had insufficient forces to take on the Godala by himself, Yahya called upon his new ally, the king War Jabi of Takrur for assistance (Takrur, a black African kingdom on the Senegal River, had entered into alliance with the Almoravids during the attack on Ghana).Levtzion, 1973: p.44 War Jabi dispatched a large Takruri force under his own son, Labi, to join up with Yahya in the Adrar. But the Gudala struck first. Before the Takruri force managed to reach him, the Godala army bore down on Azuggi, trapping Yahya's smaller force and forcing a pitched battle. The Godala destroyed the Almoravid army at the Battle of Tabfarilla in March‚ÄìApril 1056. Yahya ibn Umar was killed in the field of battle.  Aftermath  Yahya's brief career as the first Almoravid emir came to a premature end. After his death, Abdallah ibn Yasin immediately appointed Yahya's brother, Abu Bakr ibn Umar, to succeed him as the new Almoravid emir. Under Abu Bakr's leadership, the Almoravids would re-conquer Sijilmassa, and go on to a spectacular career, conquering most of the rest of Morocco in the 1070s and eventually come back down to finish off what remained of Ghana in the 1080s. Chroniclers report that Yahya ibn Umar had three sons - Muhammad, Ali and Isa. Their exact fate is unknown, but it seems their uncle, Abu Bakr ibn Umar, did not forget them. Around 1057, not long after recovering the city, Abu Bakr appointed his nephew Ali ibn Yahya as the Almoravid governor of the Sijilmassa, a post he seems to have held down to 1069.Ibn Idhari asserts Abu Bakr appointed his own son, Ibrahim ibn Abi Bakr, as governor of Sijilmassa. But Ibn al-Athir asserts it was a nephew, which numismatic evidence suggests was Ali ibn Yahya, the third son of the first Almoravid commander, Yahya ibn Umar. It is unlikely Abu Bakr would have ignored the sons of his late elder brother. So they probably both held it in sequence - first, Ali ibn Yahya from c. 1057 until 1069, then Ibrahim ibn Abi Bakr from 1069 to c. 1075 (as confirmed by coinage).See Messier (2001, p.64-65) Upon his death in 1087, Abu Bakr partitioned his dominions (covering the southern half of the Almoravid empire) not only among his own sons, but also among the sons of Yahya.Levtzion, 1973: p.46  Notes   Sources  * Levtzion, N.

Along with the westernmost range of the Phi Pan Nam Mountains further east this range separates the intermontane basins and plateaus of Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai.Heritage Thailand, Geography 4 Temperatures range from a maximum of 33¬∞C in the hot season (February to July), to a minimum of 2¬∞C during the cold season, between November and January. Snow fell in the Chai Prakan and Mae Suai District areas of the range in 1955, a very rare event in these latitudes despite the altitude.Snow in Thailand History Historically the Khun Tan Range was a formidable natural barrier between the Lanna Kingdom and the Central Plain of Siam. The Khun Tan Tunnel was built in 1907 across the southern part of the range and contributed to alleviate the difficulties in communication between Bangkok and Chiang Mai. It is the longest railway tunnel in Thailand and it took eleven years to complete. Construction was disrupted owing to the arrest of the German engineers in World War I when Siam, having been neutral until July 1917, declared war on the Central Powers.Brendan Whyte, The Railway Atlas of Thailand, Laos and Cambodia, White Lotus, Bangkok, 2010 Khun Tan Station, located at the northern end of the tunnel, is the highest railway station in Thailand at 758 m above sea level.‡∏≠‡∏∏‡πÇ‡∏°‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡πå‡∏£‡∏ñ‡πÑ‡∏ü‡∏ñ‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏Ç‡∏∏‡∏ô‡∏ï‡∏≤‡∏ô ‡∏à‡∏≤‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏ß‡πá‡∏ö‡πÑ‡∏ã‡∏ï‡πå‡∏™‡∏≥‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏á‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏™‡∏£‡∏£‡∏û‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏û‡∏∑‡πâ‡∏ô‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡∏•‡∏≥‡∏û‡∏π‡∏ô] There are certain Hill tribe communities living in the Khun Tan Range, like the Yao and the Akha who have villages in the mountain sides of the northern areas of the range in Phrao District. Part of the hill people are refugees from troubled areas in Burma and some of these communities are regularly visited by organized tourist groups.The Politics of Ethnic Tourism in Northern Thailand Thailand Route 118 between Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai cuts diagonally across the Khun Tan Range from SW to NE about 30 km northeast of Chiang Mai town. Ecology The lower altitudes are covered with dry mixed deciduous forest, while hill evergreen forest grows above 800 m, as well as in shady and narrow zones in the valleys. Extensive wildfires are deliberately set off by local farmers in the mountain forests of the Khun Tan Range every year between February and April towards the end of the dry season. One of the purposes of this somewhat radical activity is to trigger the growth of the Astraeus odoratus mushroom (; het pho) that fetches a high price on the Thai market. Often speculators hire people to set forests on fire in order to claim land title deeds for the areas that have become \\"degraded forest\\".Bangkok Post - PM misses the boat again on northern haze Although the large trees are not too badly affected, the periodic fires negatively affect the wildlife of vast areas of the mountain chain. These yearly wildfires are the main cause of the intense air pollution in Northern ThailandMushroom Research Center and contribute to the floods in the country by completely denuding the undergrowth of the woods.National Forest Policy Review- Thailand The dry forest soil leads to lower water intake for the trees to extract when the rains arrive. Wildlife Many species of mammals are assumed to have disappeared in the range for lack of recent sightings, such as the Asiatic black bear, the slow loris, the white-handed gibbon, the leopard cat and the serow. Animals that have been sighted recently include civets, wild pigs, barking deer, hog badgers, flying squirrels and bats. Among the birds, the ashy drongo, scarlet minivet, grey-headed canary- flycatcher, white-crowned forktail, brown fish owl, crested serpent eagle, shikra, velvet-fronted nuthatch, blue-throated barbet, coppersmith barbet, blue-winged leafbird, brown-cheeked fulvetta and red junglefowl deserve mention. The Khun Tan mountains also act as a natural barrier for species west and east of the range, such as the pied bushchat.Aseanbiodiversity - The Occurrence of the Pied Stonechat in Eastern and SE Thailand Reptiles in the range include the green tree viper, the king cobra and the flying lizard.

This name was chosen due to the markets that Samena invests in. These are the Indian Subcontinent, Asia, Middle East and North Africa ‚Äì a region collectively known as SAMENA. Also in ancient Buddhist script, Samena means \\"together\\" or \\"collective\\", which reflects the collective investment model the company is based on. The company and its subsidiaries employ 26 people in 3 locations (London, Dubai and Hong Kong) worldwide, and has 48 shareholders. In 2014, Samena Capital completed three landmark investment deals. In April 2013, Samena Capital closed its first private equity investment, acquiring Alliance Global Logistics Pte Ltd, a Singapore based third party logistics company. The plan is to use AGL as a platform for a roll up of logistics players across ASEAN to build an integrated regional logistics company. In February 2014, India‚Äôs Mahindra Two Wheelers (part of the US$16.7 billion Mahindra Group) and Kinetic Engineering (KEL) announced that KEL has sold its entire equity stake in Mahindra Two Wheelers Limited to Samena Capital. A leading player in the Indian two wheeler market, Mahindra Two Wheelers Limited has had considerable success with its new age commuter motorbike Centuro, developed based on keen consumer insights. In June 2014, Samena Capital completed a deal to acquire more than 30% of Ras Al Khaimah Ceramics, the world‚Äôs largest producer of ceramic tiles, from the ruler of Ras Al Khaimah, HH Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi. The acquisition was made through Samena Capital‚Äôs subsidiary, Samena Limestone Holdings, and its consortium of international investors including two Gulf sovereign wealth funds. Under the deal, Samena Capital will be represented on the board of RAK Ceramics, and the two companies will work together to use private equity strategies to unlock new growth opportunities. Business model and structure Samena Capital brings together entrepreneurs, business leaders and dealmakers from different industries across the SAMENA region, who collectively form the shareholders and the investment team. The company uses these partnerships to obtain deals and to get insights into local markets and networks in the SAMENA region, where relationships often play an important role because the markets tend to be opaque. The shareholders are involved in the running of the business, meeting quarterly to exchange investment ideas, share views on business and explore possibilities of increasing economic trade between their respective markets. Samena Capital owns three regulated investment advisory subsidiaries, the first in Hong Kong that is licensed by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, London licensed by the Financial Services Authority and Dubai licensed by the Dubai Financial Services Authority. The company also has a Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) license from the Securities and Exchange Board of India. It has a permanent capital base of US$70 million. A recent article on Samena Capital in Business Times (Raffles Conversation) calls Saraf the Silk Road Dealmaker. It quotes him as saying, \\"We tend to be conservative. We don't tend to do leverage. We don't tend to do shorting or buying exotic derivatives. We do the simple thing. We buy into a good company and hold it for three to five years before selling it,\\" he says. \\"We are partners. We help companies grow their business in a different market - for example, if an Indian company wants to go into the Middle East.\\" An article by Asian Venture Capital Journal says, \\" Operating partners now form the backbone of most private equity firms, in a variety of different guises. Samena Capital's take on this concept recognizes the importance of relationships.\\" History and overview Samena Capital was set up in 2008 to take advantage of the cross-border investment opportunities arising out of the dislocation in global financial markets, and the emergence of the Asian, Indian and Middle Eastern countries as the growth markets of the future, even as the developed countries of Europe and the USA are receding into a recession. Samena Capital's main business lines include asset management (through special situations investments, credit market opportunities and direct investments/projects) and hedge fund seeding. Through its special situations funds, it invests in companies that have the ability to go across markets (within the SAMENA region) and capitalise on cross border opportunities. The Samena Special Situations Funds apply a hybrid private equity structure to public equity investing, growth equity/platform investments, pre-IPOs and buy-out opportunities. No leverage is used in these investments. In 2010, Samena Capital began investing in the rapidly evolving credit markets in the SAMENA countries. At present, Samena Capital‚Äôs credit platform consists of the Samena India Credit Fund, which was launched in November 2013 and invests in Indian high yield corporate credit and structured credit opportunities. In 2011, Geneva-based banking group Reyl & Cie entered into a joint venture with Samena Capital via its seeding arm, Samena Asia Managers (SAM). The joint venture aims to combine Reyl and Cie's asset management and distribution expertise in Europe with Samena Capital's product expertise and network of people in the Asian, Indian and Middle East markets. The venture has been profitable since its inception. Samena's assets under management have grown significantly over the last nine years to over US1 billion. Key people Shirish Saraf is the Founder and Vice Chairman of Samena Capital. In June 2014 he led the acquisition of a significant stake in RAK Ceramics PSC, a company listed on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange and one of the world‚Äôs largest ceramics manufacturers with annual revenues of approximately US$1 billion.[3] In February 2014, Saraf closed another landmark deal, whereby India‚Äôs Mahindra Two Wheelers (part of the US$16.7 billion Mahindra Group) and Kinetic Engineering sold the equity stake in Mahindra Two Wheelers Limited to Samena Capital.[4] Prior to Samena, he was a co-founder and managing director of Abraaj Capital, one of the largest emerging markets- focused, global private equity firms with over US$6 billion in assets under management. Prior to Abraaj, his career spanned across ANZ Investment Bank, Taib Bank and Oriel Investment Company. He has held various directorships, including at Aramex Holdings, Memo Express, DCM-Hyundai (India) Limited, Commercial Bank of Oman SAOG, EFG Hermes, Amwal Capital (Qatar), Abraaj Capital and BMA Capital Management. In September 2013, AsianInvestor listed Mr Saraf as one of Asia‚Äôs 25 most influential people in Private Equity. V-Nee YEH is the Non-Executive Chairman of Samena Capital. V-Nee is a former member of the Executive Council of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (January 2009 to June 2012), the co-founder and honorary chairman of Value Partners Group, and a board member of the Columbia University Endowment.

Besides V-Nee YEH and Shirish Saraf, it includes members such as: Ramiz Hasan, founder of Japan-focused hedge fund Invicta and a founding shareholder of Samena Capital. Vincent Chan, Senior Managing Director and Head of Asia. Main activities Samena's primary business is asset management, covering special situations, credit markets and hedge fund seeding/bespoke products: Special situations The flagship Samena Special Situations Fund (SSSF I) was launched in August 2008, raising almost US$180 million amidst what was one of the most challenging capital raising environments in history. The five-year closed ended fund with a private equity structure, seeks opportunities in listed companies in the SAMENA region that have stable mature businesses with a strong management and technical knowhow, enabling them to take advantage of cross border opportunities. The fund is reported to have fully exited twelve and partially exited two out of the 18 investments it has made so far. It is also understood to have repaid 70% of its capital to investors by June 2014. Some of the most profitable investments the fund made were in Eicher Motors and Voltamp Transformers in India, Rubicon Offshore International, CSE Global in Singapore, Saudi Hollandi Bank in Saudi Arabia, Union National Bank in the UAE and Renaissance Services in Oman. As a follow up to SSSF I, the company launched Samena Special Situations Fund II, which had a Final Closing in June 2013 of US$340 million. With a seven-year closed-ended structure, this fund has an investment strategy similar to its predecessor, but with an added emphasis on private placement and co-investment opportunities. The fund's investment strategy is based on a non-leveraged, hybrid investment model, consisting of two distinct portfolios: core investments that form the strategic portfolio, and the more tactical non-core investments that are held for trading or re-sale. With the growth of its special situations business, Samena is understood to be seeking co-investment opportunities projects and direct investments, which are likely to be of a strategic or pre-IPO nature across a range of industries and geographies. Credit and Fixed Income markets At present, Samena Capital‚Äôs credit platform consists of the Samena India Credit Fund, which was launched in November 2013 and invests in Indian high yield corporate credit and structured credit opportunities . Samena Capital established its credit business in February 2010 with the launch of the Samena Asia Credit Fund, a high conviction portfolio of high-yield bonds and other credit investments with a medium-term maturity or investment horizon. It also ran the Samena Credit Opportunities, co-advised with Reyl Asset Management. The Samena Asia Credit Fund has subsequently been closed, with Samena Capital having made a profitable exit from the business. Hedge fund seeding, managed accounts and bespoke products To take advantage of the consolidation of the asset management industry during the global financial crisis of 2008, Samena Capital acquired an Asian hedge fund seeding platform from Vision Investment Management in May 2009. The platform has since then been renamed Samena Asia Managers (SAM), and manages the Samena Angel Fund with approximately US$80 million in AUM. The fund provides seed capital to early stage, Asia-focused hedge funds and/or invests in niche hedge funds. Two of the most successful hedge funds it has seeded/accelerated are Chicago-based Phalanx Capital and a Greater China Long/Short Equity Fund. Phalanx Capital won the \\"Best Multi Strategy Fund\\" award from AsiaHedge in 2009 and was nominated in this category again in 2010. In April 2011, Reyl & Cie, one of the leading Swiss banking and asset management groups, decided to partner with Samena Capital in a joint venture that combined SAM's hedge fund seeding business with Reyl and Cie's wealth and asset management expertise. The JV has been profitable since inception.

Born in England, Stevens emigrated to New Zealand with his family in 1895. He joined the New Zealand Military Forces in 1912 and later served with the New Zealand Field Artillery during the First World War. Between the wars he attended Staff College in England and later held a number of positions which required co-ordination of civilian and military resources. During the Second World War he held important administrative roles in the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF). He was commander of the 2NZEF from November 1945 to June 1946 and oversaw its demobilisation. Stevens retired from the military in 1946 with the rank of major general. He became a diplomat, serving at the New Zealand High Commission in London for several years before his retirement in 1953. He later authored two volumes of the Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War 1939‚Äì45. He died in 1975 in Nelson. Early life William George Stevens was born in London, England, on 11 December 1893. His father, William Stevens, was a mariner employed by the New Zealand Shipping Company and would be absent from the family home for long periods of time while at sea. His mother, Catherine , was a former teacher. The Stevens family moved to New Zealand in 1895 and settled in Auckland. He attended Auckland Grammar School and planned to pursue a career in civil engineering but his mother encouraged him to enter the New Zealand Military Forces. Military career In 1912, after initially being rejected due to a heart murmur, Stevens entered the Royal Military College at Duntroon in Australia as a cadet officer. He enjoyed his time at Duntroon but when the First World War broke out, his class was graduated early in November 1914. First World War Stevens was seconded to the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) and was posted to the New Zealand Field Artillery. He embarked for Gallipoli with the fourth reinforcements in April 1915, going ashore in August of that year. Apart from a period of time during October which he spent in Malta recuperating from illness, he participated in the Gallipoli Campaign until the Allied forces were evacuated in December 1915. In April 1916, he was transferred to the Western Front with the newly formed New Zealand Division. In late December 1916, while recuperating from a horse-riding injury in England he married his fianc√©e, Gladys Baker, of Auckland. The couple had three children. He returned to active duty in early 1917 on attachment to the headquarters of the New Zealand Division. Later in the year, he suffered from trench foot for which he was hospitalised in England, before being appointed staff captain of the divisional artillery in December 1917. He was serving in this role when the war ended in November 1918. He was discharged from the NZEF in September 1919 with the rank of major. Interwar period Stevens returned to New Zealand in 1920, having using the intervening time to attend an artillery course in England. He had intended to quit the New Zealand Military Forces. However, upon earning top marks for the entrance examination for the Staff College in Camberley, he returned to England for a two-year course. After completing the course, he then went on to the Imperial Defence College in London. In 1929, Stevens was brought back to New Zealand as commander of the Royal Artillery, Central Command, based at Palmerston North. He then commanded the General Headquarters Training Depot at Trentham. He was also on the staff of General Headquarters's operations and intelligence branch. While in London in the late 1920s, Stevens formed the view that New Zealand's future defence requirements would involve greater co-ordination between the civilian infrastructure of the government and the military. In 1937, when he was appointed as secretary of New Zealand's Council of Defence as well as the Chiefs of Staff Committee, he became absorbed in the Organisation for National Security. The organisation, consisting of a multitude of committees, was responsible for preparation of a manual detailing the actions necessary to bring the country to a war footing. This allowed Stevens the opportunity to put his theories in relation to integration of military and civilian resources into practice. As a result of his efforts, when war did break out in Europe in 1939, the infrastructure of New Zealand was well prepared for prompt mobilisation. Second World War Peter Fraser, Prime Minister of New Zealand, at Naples Airport, May 1944 In late 1939, Stevens accompanied Peter Fraser, the acting Prime Minister of New Zealand, to London for talks with the British government, advising him on military affairs. He had worked with Fraser previously as part of the Council of Defence. The 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF), consisting of a single division, the 2nd New Zealand Division, was then being raised in New Zealand for service overseas. Stevens, now a lieutenant colonel, was seconded to the 2NZEF and made Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster-General of the division. He duly embarked for Egypt with the 1st Echelon of the 2NZEF. In addition to his divisional duties, he was also required to administer the 2NZEF as a whole. Although an able administrator, the workload was excessive and in October 1940, he dropped his divisional responsibilities and was appointed Officer in Charge of Administration of HQ 2NZEF. In this role, he controlled the various depots, administrative units and reinforcements for 2NZEF. Stevens was based in Egypt from 1940 until 1944, when HQ 2NZEF was shifted to Italy. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire and promoted to brigadier in 1941. This was followed three years later by an appointment as a Companion of the Order of the Bath. In November 1945, he reached the pinnacle of his military career when he was appointed General Officer Commanding, 2NZEF, replacing Bernard Freyberg. Promoted to major general, he oversaw the demobilisation of the 2NZEF until mid-1946. Later life After being overlooked for the role of Chief of Staff of the New Zealand Military Forces, Stevens decided that he did not desire a career in the peacetime army and retired in 1946. In June the same year he joined the Department of External Affairs and later took up a position as official secretary to the New Zealand High Commission in London. He retired in 1953 but continued to live with his wife in England rather than return to New Zealand. While in retirement, Stevens authored two volumes of the Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War 1939‚Äì45. The first was Problems of NZEF, published in 1958, and the second was Bardia to Enfidaville, published in 1962. By this time, he and his wife had moved back to New Zealand for financial and family reasons. He settled in Richmond, outside of Nelson in the South Island. He continued to write and in 1965, a work on the wartime service of his former commander, Freyberg, was published. Stevens's last years were spent living in a retirement home in Stoke, a suburb of Nelson. He died of a heart attack on 7 August 1975, his wife having predeceased him in 1967, and his ashes were buried at Marsden Valley Cemetery.

Born in Scotland, Stewart worked in Russia teaching English after completing his education. He then taught classical studies at the University of Liverpool in England and then at Canterbury College in Christchurch, New Zealand. During the First World War, he volunteered for service abroad with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force. He participated in several engagements at Gallipoli and on the Western Front, and was decorated for bravery and leadership. He ended the war as a lieutenant colonel commanding a battalion of the Canterbury Infantry Regiment, having also led briefly the 2nd Infantry Brigade. After the war, Stewart wrote a history of the New Zealand Division, which was published in 1921 and was its main reference work for several decades. He resumed his teaching career at Canterbury College but in 1926 returned to England, as a Professor of Latin at the University of Leeds. In 1929, he became the principal of University College of Nottingham. He died suddenly in 1934 while in transit to England after a holiday in New Zealand. Early life and teaching career Stewart was born on 1 September 1884 in Premnay, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, to John Stewart, a Presbyterian minister and Margaret Mackintosh. He was educated at the local public school in Premnay. An excellent student, he earned a scholarship to Fettes College at Edinburgh. In 1903, he attended the University of Edinburgh and then transferred to Trinity College, Cambridge, from which he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1907, majoring in Classical Studies. During his tertiary education he also served in the Territorial Force as a lieutenant in the 6th Battalion, King's Regiment (Liverpool). Stewart spent the next two years working in Russia as a tutor, teaching English. He learned Russian and wrote a book describing his experiences and the country, Provincial Russia. Returning to England, he took up an appointment as Assistant Lecturer in Classics at the University of Liverpool. In 1912, he accepted a professorship teaching classics at Canterbury College, in Christchurch, New Zealand. At the college, later to become the University of Canterbury, he acquired a reputation for his energy and wit. In his leisure time, he often went climbing in the Southern Alps. First World War When the First World War broke out in August 1914, Stewart enlisted in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF). He received a commission as a lieutenant and was posted to the Canterbury Battalion, New Zealand Infantry Brigade, which embarked from Wellington in October 1914 for Suez, Egypt. In Egypt, the brigade was combined with an Australian infantry brigade to form the New Zealand and Australian Division, intended for service in the Gallipoli Campaign. Stewart served at Gallipoli and received a head wound during the fighting at Quinn's Post in June 1915 but, despite this, remained in the frontlines. He was promoted to captain in August, and to major two months later. He was recommended for the Military Cross for his action at Quinn's Post and this was duly gazetted following the withdrawal of the Allies from Gallipoli. He was also awarded the French Croix de guerre for his \\"distinguished services rendered during the course of the campaign\\". By January 1916, the manpower of the NZEF had expanded sufficiently that it could field an infantry division on the Western Front. The New Zealand and Australian Division, which had been evacuated to Egypt from Gallipoli, was disbanded and the New Zealand Division created from the original infantry brigade and two new brigades (the 2nd Infantry Brigade and New Zealand Rifle Brigade), which had recently arrived from New Zealand. Promoted to lieutenant colonel on 27 February 1916, Stewart took command of the new 2nd Battalion, Canterbury Infantry Regiment, which was attached to the 2nd Infantry Brigade. He led the battalion for nearly the duration of its service on the Western Front. In June 1917, Stewart was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in recognition of his leadership of his battalion during the Battle of Flers‚ÄìCourcelette in September 1916. He had planned and executed an attack by his battalion on German-held trenches and once the objective was captured, organised its defence against several counter-attacks. He was awarded a Bar to his DSO six months later, for his efforts during the Battle of Messines during which he was wounded. His injuries were severe, due to eight separate shrapnel wounds and he was evacuated to London for treatment. Returning to the field in late 1917, he was temporary commander of the 2nd Infantry Brigade at various times during 1918, while its regular commander was on leave or employed elsewhere. While on leave, on 21 February 1918, Stewart married Alexandrina Kathleen Johnston at Uttoxeter, in the county of Staffordshire in England. Just after the cessation of hostilities he was temporarily promoted to colonel and was appointed Director of Education for the NZEF. He remained at that post through to February 1919 at which time he was discharged from the NZEF, having reverted to his substantive rank of lieutenant colonel. During the course of the war, Stewart had been mentioned in despatches five times. In May 1919 he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George and his citation noted his leadership of his battalion and temporary command of 2nd Infantry Brigade as well as his educational work for the NZEF. Postwar life Stewart was commissioned by the New Zealand Government to write a history of the New Zealand Division and its service on the Western Front as part of the Official History of New Zealand's Effort in the Great War. He began work on the first draft in January 1919, while still in England. He returned to New Zealand in December that year and resumed his pre-war teaching position at Canterbury College, while continuing work on his history. The final result, titled The New Zealand Division 1916 ‚Äì 1919: A Popular History Based on Official Records, was published in 1921 and was the primary reference for New Zealand's contribution to the campaign on the Western Front for several decades. Prior to its publication, Stewart's wife died shortly after giving birth to a son. Although discharged from the NZEF, Stewart was still in the military reserve and commanded a battalion of the Territorial Force (TF). He was later given command of the TF's 3rd Infantry Brigade. From 1924 to 1926, he was president of the New Zealand Returned Servicemen's Association. His leadership of the association ended when he left New Zealand to become Professor of Latin at the University of Leeds. On 28 July 1927, Stewart married Margaret Rosamond Poulton at Kinlet, Shropshire, England. The marriage was brief; she and their baby son, died during childbirth in August 1928. In 1929 Stewart was appointed principal of University College of Nottingham, later to become the University of Nottingham. In a history of the University of Canterbury, published in 1973, the authors wrote that Stewart was the \\"most able leader and administrator ... the College [of Nottingham] ever had\\". The year after his move to Nottingham, Stewart married Margaret Isabel Massey in London. The couple had two children, a daughter and a son. Stewart travelled to New Zealand on holiday in August 1934 and resumed many of his past military acquaintances. While on passage to England he died unexpectedly aboard the ship and was buried at sea. He was survived by his third wife and his three children. Legacy After his death, Stewart was honoured by the renaming of Lenton Hall of Residence at the University of Nottingham to Hugh Stewart Hall. The university also named a scholarship after him. A tablet in his honour was unveiled on 18 January 1935 at the premises of the Christchurch Returned Soldier's Association by the former commander of the NZEF, Alexander Godley.

He served as a Commissioner for the Victualling of the Navy from 1689 to 1699. Thomas Papillon, 1698 portrait by Godfrey Kneller Early life He was the third son of David Papillon by his second wife, Anne Marie Calandrini, he was born at Roehampton House, Roehampton, on 6 September 1623. He went to school at Drayton, Northamptonshire, was articled in 1637 to Thomas Chambrelan, a London merchant, and in the following year was apprenticed to the Mercers' Company, of which he received the freedom in 1646. Under the Commonwealth Papillon was implicated in the riots of 26 July 1647, when a mob broke into St. Stephen's and forced Parliament to rescind the recent ordinance by which the City of London had been deprived of the control of its militia. When the Independent faction regained the ascendency over the Presbyterians (August), he slipped off to France to avoid arrest, but returned in November, and was committed to Newgate Prison during the following February. After some demur, Papillon was released on bail. About the same time he began business on his own account as a general merchant. Except to petition the Council of State against an illegal impost on lead in 1653, and to defend the autonomy of the French church, of which he was a deacon, against the Privy Council in 1657, he avoided public affairs until the Restoration of 1660. Under Charles II Papillon was placed on the council of trade and foreign plantations, and in 1663 on the directorate of the East India Company, which he had joined on its reconstruction in 1657. He continued to serve on the directorate until 1670, and in 1667 watched the interests of the company at Breda during the negotiations with the Dutch Republic. He was also on the directorate from 1675 to 1682, with the exception of 1676, when, having given offence to the king, he was excluded at his instance. The reason of his disfavour at court was probably the resistance which he had offered in the law courts to a claim by the farmers of excise for excessive duty on brandy. He was deputy-governor of the company in 1680 and 1681. Papillon was returned to Parliament as Member for Dover on 11 February 1673, and kept the seat until the dissolution of 28 March 1681. During that period he was an effective speaker, and sat on 68 committees. An adherent of the country party, he censured in committee of the whole house (March 1676) the pass system, under by English merchant ships had no protection on the high seas unless provided with government licenses; and supported (18 February 1678) the motion for making the army vote conditional on the disclosure of foreign alliances. A strong Protestant, he moved on 18 November 1678 the committal to the Tower of London of the secretary of state, Sir Joseph Williamson. He credited the Popish Plot allegations. A free-trader, Papillon opposed in May 1679 the bill for continuing the act prohibiting the importation into England of Irish cattle. Against the court, he identified himself with the defence of the threatened corporation of Dover. When Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury was indicted at the Old Bailey (24 November 1681), he asserted the right of grand juries to examine witnesses in secret, though with no success. Papillon's candidature for the shrievalty of London in 1682 became the occasion of a trial of strength between the court and the country parties. On 6 November 1684, a jury awarded Sir William Pritchard, whom Papillon had attacked for making a false return to a mandamus to swear him in as sheriff, the sum of ¬£10,000 damages in an action of false imprisonment. To avoid payment Papillon mortgaged his estates to his son-in- law, and left for Utrecht. A Treatise concerning the East India Trade: being a most profitable trade to the Kingdom, and best secured and improved by a company and joint stock. Wrote at the instance of Thomas Papillon, Esqr., in his house, and printed in the year 1680, was reprinted in 1696, in London. Under William and Mary After the Glorious Revolution Papillon came home, and was returned to the Convention parliament for Dover on 10 January 1689. He retained that seat until 1695. On 25 October of that year he was elected for the City of London, which he continued to represent until the dissolution of 19 December 1700. Soon after his return he joined the New East India Company‚Äîhe had terminated his connection with the old company after the defeat of a scheme for its reconstruction on a broader basis in 1681‚Äîand in January 1693‚Äì4 was chairman of the committee of the House of Commons on the affair of the Redbridge, an East Indiaman, arrested in the River Thames as an 'interloper' by the Admiralty at the instance of the old company. He then worked towards the ultimate amalgamation of the two companies. In November 1689 Papillon was appointed a Commissioner for the Victualling of the Navy, holding the post until his resignation on 26 May 1699. He died in London on 5 May 1702. His remains were interred on 21 May in the parish church at Acrise, Kent, the manor of which he had purchased in 1666. Family Papillon married, in Canterbury Cathedral, on 30 October 1651, Jane, daughter of Thomas Broadnax of Godmersham, Kent; she died in 1698. Their children included Elizabeth, born on 27 July 1658, who married on 30 March 1676 Edward Ward; and Philip (1660‚Äì1736), his heir-at-law, born on 26 November 1660, M.P. for Dover in the reign of Queen Anne. Papillon's eldest brother, Philip Papillon (1620‚Äì1641), born on 1 January 1620, graduated B.A. from Exeter College, Oxford, in 1638, and proceeded M.A. in 1641, in which year he died. He published the tragedy of his friend and fellow collegian Samuel Hardinge, entitled Sicily and Naples, in 1640, against the author's wish. With Hardinge and other members of Exeter College, he wrote verses urging William Browne of Tavistock to publish his promised continuation of Britannia's Pastorals.

Its three volumes in English are: 1: The Founders, II: The Golden Age, and III: The Breakdown. It was first published in Polish in Paris in 1976, with the English translation appearing in 1978. In 2005, Main Currents of Marxism was republished in a one volume edition, with a new preface and epilogue by Ko≈Çakowski. The work was intended to be a \\"handbook\\" on Marxism by Ko≈Çakowski, who was once an orthodox Marxist but ultimately rejected Marxism. Despite his critical stand toward Marxism, Ko≈Çakowski endorsed the philosopher Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs's interpretation of the philosopher Karl Marx. The book received many positive reviews, praising Ko≈Çakowski for his discussion of Marxism in general, and historical materialism, Luk√°cs, Polish Marxism, Leon Trotsky, Herbert Marcuse, and the Frankfurt School in particular. Ko≈Çakowski was also praised for the quality of his writing. Other reviewers were more critical of his treatment of the Frankfurt School. Reviewers were divided in their evaluations of his treatment of Karl Kautsky, Vladimir Lenin, and Antonio Gramsci. Ko≈Çakowski was criticized for omitting discussions of particular authors or topics, his hostility to Marxism, his adherence to Luk√°cs's interpretation of Marx, his failure to explain Marxism's appeal, and for giving a misleading impression of Marxism by focusing on Marxist philosophers at the expense of other Marxist writers. Summary Karl Marx. Ko≈Çakowski provided an analysis of Marx's work. Ko≈Çakowski discusses the origins, philosophical roots, golden age and breakdown of Marxism, and the various schools of Marxist philosophy. He describes Marxism as \\"the greatest fantasy of the twentieth century\\", a dream of a perfect society which became a foundation for \\"a monstrous edifice of lies, exploitation and oppression.\\" He argues that the Leninist and Stalinist versions of communist ideology are not a distortion or degenerate form of Marxism, but one of its possible interpretations. Despite his rejection of Marxism, his interpretation of Marx is influenced by Luk√°cs. His first volume discusses the intellectual background of Marxism, examining the contributions of Plotinus, Johannes Scotus Eriugena, Meister Eckhart, Nicholas of Cusa, Jakob B√∂hme, Angelus Silesius, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Ludwig Feuerbach, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and Moses Hess, as well as an analysis of the work of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Though he does not accept that Hegel was an apologist for totalitarianism, he writes of Hegel that, \\"the practical application of his doctrine means that in any case where the state apparatus and the individual are in conflict, is the former which must prevail.\\" The second volume includes a discussion of the Second International and figures such as Paul Lafargue, Eduard Bernstein, Karl Kautsky, Georgi Plekhanov, Jean Jaur√®s, Jan Wac≈Çaw Machajski, Vladimir Lenin, Rosa Luxemburg, and Rudolf Hilferding; it reviews Hilferding's debate about the theory of value with the economist Eugen B√∂hm von Bawerk. It also discusses Austromarxism. The third volume deals with Marxist thinkers such as Leon Trotsky, Antonio Gramsci, Luk√°cs, Joseph Stalin, Karl Korsch, Lucien Goldmann, Herbert Marcuse, J√ºrgen Habermas, and Ernst Bloch, as well as the Frankfurt School and critical theory. Ko≈Çakowski critically discusses works such as Luk√°cs's History and Class Consciousness (1923) and Bloch's The Principle of Hope (1954). He also discusses the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. Ko≈Çakowski criticizes Sartre's Critique of Dialectical Reason (1960). Ko≈Çakowski criticizes dialectical materialism, arguing that it consists partly of truisms with no specific Marxist content, partly of philosophical dogmas, partly of nonsense, and partly of statements that could be any of these things depending on how they are interpreted. In the preface added to the 2005 edition, Ko≈Çakowski attributed the demise of communism in Europe partly to the collapse of Marxism as an ideology. He reaffirmed the value of Marxism as an area of study despite the end of European communism, and suggested that a future revival of Marxism and communism, though far from certain, was still possible. In his added epilogue, Ko≈Çakowski concluded that his work on Marxism \\"may perhaps be useful to the dwindling number of people still interested in the subject.\\" Background and publication history According to Ko≈Çakowski, Main Currents of Marxism was written in Polish between 1968 and 1976, at a time when it was impossible to publish the work in Communist ruled Poland. A Polish edition was published in France by the Institut Litt√©raire between 1976 and 1978, and then copied by underground Polish publishers, while the English edition, translated by P. S. Falla, was published in 1978 by Oxford University Press. Translations in German, Dutch, Italian, Serbo-Croatian, and Spanish subsequently appeared. Another Polish edition was published in the United Kingdom in 1988 by the publishing house Aneks. The work was first published legally in Poland in 2000. Ko≈Çakowski writes that only the first two volumes appeared in French translation because \\"the third volume would provoke such an outrage among French Leftists that the publishers were afraid to risk it.\\" A one-volume English edition, with a new preface and epilogue by Ko≈Çakowski, was published in 2005. Reception Overview Main Currents of Marxism has been praised by authors such as the philosophers A. J. Ayer, Roger Scruton, and John Gray, the conservative commentator William F. Buckley Jr., and the political scientists Charles R. Kesler and David McLellan. Scruton credited Ko≈Çakowski with lucidly describing the main tendencies of Marxism. He expressed agreement with Ko≈Çakowski's view of Luk√°cs as \\"an intellectual Stalinist, one for whom an opponent sacrifices, by his very opposition, the right to exist.\\" Gray called the book \\"magisterial\\". Buckley and Kesler called Main Currents of Marxism \\"excellent\\" and credited Ko≈Çakowski with demonstrating \\"the connection between Marxist theory and Stalinist reality\\". McLellan praised Ko≈Çakowski for the thoroughness of his philosophical discussion of Marx. Mixed evaluations of the book include those of the Marxist historian G. E. M. de Ste. Croix and the historian of science Roger Smith. De Ste. Croix considered the book overpraised, but nevertheless acknowledged that he was influenced by it. He credited Ko≈Çakowski with accurately describing some of the disastrous developments of Marx's thought by many of his followers. Smith wrote that while Main Currents of Marxism is \\"written by a deeply disabused Polish ex-Marxist intellectual\\", it is \\"an invaluable history across an extended range.\\" The philosopher Richard Rorty wrote that eastern and central Europeans who have read Ko≈Çakowski suspect that he tells you \\"pretty much all you will ever need to know about Marx and Marxism‚ÄìLeninism.\\" Critical views of the book include those of the political theorist Paul Thomas and the philosophers M. W. Jackson and Jon Stewart. Thomas argued that Ko≈Çakowski, motivated by the wish to connect Marx to \\"his self-appointed disciples\\", wrongly interprets Marxism as \\"radical anthropocentrism, a secularization of the (real) religious absolute, a formula for human self- perfectibility, and the self-deification of humankind.\\" Jackson criticized Ko≈Çakowski's treatment of Hegel, arguing that Ko≈Çakowski is one of many authors who have misleadingly seen Hegel's philosophy as supporting authoritarian politics. Stewart listed Main Currents of Marxism as a work that has promoted \\"myths\\" about Hegel. Reviews Main Currents of Marxism received positive reviews from the economist Mark Blaug in Economica, the historian Martin Jay in The American Historical Review, the philosopher Sidney Hook in The American Scholar, and John E. Elliott in the Journal of Economic Issues. The book received two positive reviews in Library Journal, the first from Robert C. O'Brien, who reviewed the original English edition, and the second from Francisca Goldsmith, who reviewed the one-volume 2005 edition of the work. The book received mixed reviews from the sociologist Craig Calhoun in Social Forces, David Joravsky in Theory & Society, and Franklin Hugh Adler in The Antioch Review. The book received negative reviews from the sociologist Barry Hindess in The Sociological Review and the sociologist Ralph Miliband in Political Studies. The book was also reviewed by William P. Collins in The Journal of Politics, the political scientist Michael Harrington in The New Republic, Ken Plumme in Sociology, the philosopher Marx W. Wartofsky in Praxis International, and the historian Tony Judt in The New York Review of Books. Blaug considered the book \\"brilliant\\" and important to the social sciences. He credited Ko≈Çakowski with summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of Marxism, and praised his discussions of historical materialism, Engels's Dialectics of Nature, Kautsky, Plekhanov, Leninism, Trotsky, Trotskyism, Luk√°cs, Marcuse, and Althusser. However he believed that, due to his background as a philosopher, Ko≈Çakowski treated Marxism primarily in philosophical and political terms, thereby distorting the pivotal role of economic theory in Marxism. He criticized Ko≈Çakowski for ignoring and neglecting important elements in Marxian economics, such as Paul Sweezy's revival of the work of Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz in The Theory of Capitalist Development (1942). He also thought that there were several other subjects which Ko≈Çakowski could have given greater attention, including \\"the controversies over Soviet economic policy in the 1920s\\". He considered Ko≈Çakowski's bibliography excellent, though he was surprised at the exclusion of the philosopher H. B. Acton's The Illusion of the Epoch (1955) and the philosopher Karl Popper's The Open Society and Its Enemies (1945). He praised the quality of Ko≈Çakowski's writing, as well as that of its translation. Jay described the book as \\"extraordinarily valuable\\" and \\"powerfully written\\", \\"an awesome achievement of synthetic scholarship and critical analysis\\", and a \\"monument of committed learning\\". He praised Ko≈Çakowski's account of the \\"origins of dialectic\\", and his discussion of the philosophical aspects of Marx's theory, though considering them relatively unoriginal. He also praised Ko≈Çakowski's discussion of Marxism's economic foundations, and his critique of the labor theory of value. He credited Ko≈Çakowski with exposing the fallacies of historical materialism's reliance on the causal power of the economy \\"in the last resort\\". However, he criticized Ko≈Çakowski's treatment of Luk√°cs, Korsch, Gramsci, the Frankfurt School, Goldmann, and Bloch, calling it \\"vituperative and ungenerous\\" and lacking in detachment, though he granted that Ko≈Çakowski was aware of this issue. He wrote that while Ko≈Çakowski's work contained occasional factual errors or dubious interpretations, there were remarkably few of them considering its length. Hook wrote that the book opened a \\"new era in Marxist criticism\\" and provided \\"the most comprehensive treatment of Marx, and of thinkers in the Marxist tradition\\". He praised Ko≈Çakowski's discussion of Polish Marxists, Gramsci, Luk√°cs, the Frankfurt School, Bernstein, historical materialism, Hess's influence on Marxism, the recognition of individuality in \\"Marx's social ideal\\", the failure of attempts to resolve contradictions between the first and third volumes of Das Kapital, the concept of exploitation in Marx, and Jaur√®s and Lafargue. He agreed with Ko≈Çakowski's that Trotsky's views were no different in essentials from those of Stalin and that Stalinism can be justified on Leninist principles. However, he criticized Ko≈Çakowski for his treatment of some Marxists, and for ignoring the sociologist Lewis Samuel Feuer's \\"research on the influence of American utopian socialist colonies on Marx.\\" He was unconvinced by Ko≈Çakowski's discussions of the differences between Marx and Engels and between Marx and Lenin, and criticized him for endorsing Luk√°cs's reading of Marx. He rejected Ko≈Çakowski's view that Marx consistently adhered to \\"Feuerbach's notion of the species nature of man\\", questioned his view of Marx's development as a thinker, and rejected his view that Marx's historical materialism amounted to a form of technological determinism, as well as his interpretation of Marx's theory of knowledge. Elliott described the book as \\"comprehensive\\" and essential reading for any serious student of Marxism. He was convinced by Ko≈Çakowski's argument that Marx's later works, such as Das Kapital, were consistent with his earlier works from 1843 onward, continuing and elaborating their principles. He found the first volume valuable to economists in the \\"institutionalist tradition\\" for Ko≈Çakowski's observation that Marx never adopted an ethical or normative point of view, his explanation of Marx's notion of praxis, the \\"interweaving of theory and practice\\", and his explanation that Marx's critique of capitalism starts \\"not with poverty but with dehumanization.\\" He found the second volume a \\"tour de force\\", and considered it in some ways the best of the three. He commended Ko≈Çakowski's discussion of how the various Marxist schools of thought during the Second International differed from each other, and from Marx. While he found Ko≈Çakowski's discussions of Lenin and Soviet Marxism informative, he added that they had to be read with an awareness of Ko≈Çakowski's opposition to the Soviet regime. He considered Ko≈Çakowski better at describing than criticizing Marxism, and criticized him for over-relying on B√∂hm von Bawerk's critique of Marx's theory of value. However, he concluded that Ko≈Çakowski's work had merits that more than made up for these deficiencies. O'Brien described the book as a \\"comprehensive, detailed survey of the development of Marxist doctrine\\" and a \\"remarkable work\\". He credited Ko≈Çakowski with showing \\"the essential continuity of development\\" of Marx's thought up to its culmination in Das Kapital, and considered his chapters on Luk√°cs, Bloch, Marcuse, the Frankfurt School, and Mao Zedong especially valuable. Goldsmith credited Ko≈Çakowski with discussing Marxism with \\"thoroughness and lucidity\\", as well as with \\"clarity\\" and \\"comprehensiveness\\". Calhoun wrote that the book attracted criticism from left-wing writers due partly to Ko≈Çakowski's abandonment of Marxism, but that as the only \\"handbook\\" of Marxism it was influential even on the left. He criticized Ko≈Çakowski's lack of sympathy for Marxism, and argued that he focused on Marxist writers only insofar as they could be considered philosophers and distorted Marxism by giving insufficient attention to Marxist economists, historians, and social scientists. He considered the book clearly written, but not \\"an adequate reference work.\\" He found Ko≈Çakowski's first volume a good discussion of Marx, but suggested that it contained \\"too few insights not to have been written in a more readable fashion\\". He found the discussion of Russian Marxism in the second volume both often unfair and over-long. He was unconvinced by Ko≈Çakowski's argument that Stalinism was the logical conclusion of the work of Lenin, and considered Ko≈Çakowski's treatment of the impact of the Soviet Union on Marxism in other countries inadequate. He agreed with some, but not all, of Ko≈Çakowski's criticisms of the Frankfurt School. He concluded that Main Currents of Marxism did not give as good a sense of Marxism as an intellectual enterprise as it could have. Joravsky saw the book as a continuation of arguments over Marxism that Ko≈Çakowski had previously engaged in while a member of the Communist Party of Poland. He wrote that Ko≈Çakowski's negative portrayal of the historical consequences of Marxism was \\"at odds with the factual richness and complexity\\" of Main Currents of Marxism. He accused Ko≈Çakowski of inconsistency by presenting himself as being beyond disputes between Marxists, while still adhering to Luk√°cs's interpretation of Marx, and of unfairly blaming Marx for totalitarianism. He found much of Main Currents of Marxism dull, and considered Ko≈Çakowski's account of Marx's place in the history of philosophy tendentious. He criticized him for ignoring the problems Marx posed to social science and giving Marx credit only for commonplaces such as considering the social context of beliefs, and for dealing only with Marxist writers who were connected with Marxist movements or regimes. He gave a more favorable assessment of his discussions of Austromarxism, Polish Marxism, and Habermas, but was dissatisfied with his treatment of the Communist movement as a whole, accusing him being preoccupied with Russia and neglecting other countries. Adler described the book as an unprecedented and \\"largely unsurpassed\\" critical study of Marxism. Although he concluded that Ko≈Çakowski's personal history largely explains his stance took towards Marxism, he found Main Currents of Marxism generally intellectually honest. However, while he considered Ko≈Çakowski's critique of Eastern European Marxism to be strong, its strength made his dismissive treatment of Western Marxism and the New Left all the more disappointing. He suggested that Ko≈Çakowski's views on the New Left might have been shaped by his contact with the Berkeley counterculture in the 1960s, and that Ko≈Çakowski had failed to try to understand what led to the crisis of faith in the values of democratic societies that produced the New Left. He praised Ko≈Çakowski's discussion of Gramsci and Luk√°cs, but wrote that he \\"applies them one-sidedly to a critique of Eastern Marxism, never to how their critiques of hegemony and reification might apply specifically to conditions of advanced capitalism\\", and that his treatment of the Frankfurt School and Marcuse was harsh and unfair. He also found the one-volume edition of the book so large and heavy as to be cumbersome and physically difficult to use. Hindess described the book as \\"a ponderous polemic\\" against Marxism, Lenin, and the Bolsheviks. He considered Ko≈Çakowski lacking in detachment, and criticized him for not considering alternatives to his view that Marx's thought was a philosophical anthropology settled in its essential features by the time of The German Ideology, and for relying on \\"the notion of totalitarianism\\", which he considered \\"worthless as a tool of political analysis\\". He argued that because Ko≈Çakowski viewed Marxism as a philosophy he gave insufficient attention to \\"the use of Marxism as a means of political calculation or to the substantive questions of political and economic analysis posed in numerous Marxist attempts at concrete analysis\\". He accused Ko≈Çakowski of providing misleading discussions of Marxist writers such as Kautsky, and of Lenin's politics and the development of Stalinism. He described Ko≈Çakowski's account of Marxism as a \\"grotesque and offensive caricature\\" that failed to explain Marxism's impact on the modern world. Miliband wrote that Ko≈Çakowski had provided a comprehensive survey of Marxism. However, while he praised much of Ko≈Çakowski's discussion of Marxism, he considered him too hostile to Marxism for his description of his work as a \\"handbook\\" to be accurate, and maintained that his approach to Marxism and its history was \\"fundamentally misconceived.\\" He argued that Ko≈Çakowski's view of the relation of Marxism to Leninism and Stalinism was mistaken, and that Ko≈Çakowski ignored important differences between Marx's early and later work, falsely portraying Marx as an \\"unchanging philosophical visionary\\" rather than primarily as an \\"economic and social theorist\\". He described Ko≈Çakowski's view that Marxism aimed at \\"a society of perfect unity, in which all human aspirations would be fulfilled and all values reconciled\\" as \\"absurdly overdrawn\\", and inconsistent with some of Ko≈Çakowski's other observations, maintaining that Ko≈Çakowski did not provide sufficient argument to support his conclusions. He accused Ko≈Çakowski of misrepresented Marx and failing to explain the appeal of Marxism; he also faulted Ko≈Çakowski's discussion of historical materialism, and accused him of \\"character assassination\\" against Luxemburg. He rejected Ko≈Çakowski's view that reformist socialism and Leninism are the only two political options for Marxists. He concluded that Main Currents of Marxism was unworthy of its author's talent or his subject. Ko≈Çakowski replied to Miliband's review, reaffirming his views as expressed in Main Currents of Marxism, and accusing Miliband of misrepresenting them.

He became chief baron of the exchequer, and is best known as the judge in the state trial for piracy of Captain Kidd. Robert White. Life Born in June 1638, he was the second son of William Ward of Preston, Rutland. He was educated under Francis Meres at Wing, Rutland. He was a student at Clifford's Inn, and was then admitted in June 1664 at the Inner Temple; he was called to the bar in 1670, and obtained a practice in the exchequer court. Connected with the Whig faction, Ward appeared as one of the counsel for William Russell, Lord Russell, in July 1683. On 6 November 1684 he was leading counsel for his father-in-law, Thomas Papillon, in the action for false imprisonment brought against him by Sir William Pritchard. Ward's argument was interrupted by Chief-justice George Jeffreys, who declared that he had made a long speech but did not understand what he was about. Ward persisted, Jeffreys repeated his observations, there was hissing in the court, and Ward called his witnesses. The verdict went against his client, but in 1688 Ward was able to settle scores with Pritchard. On 25 November 1684 Ward appeared in the exchequer court for Charles Gerard, 1st Earl of Macclesfield, in the action of scandalum magnatum against John Starkey, a juryman of Cheshire, by which county he had recently been presented as a disaffected person. In 1687 Ward became bencher of his inn, of which he was also Lent reader in 1690 and treasurer in 1693. On 12 April 1689 he was appointed by William III a justice of the common pleas, but was excused, at his own wish, four days later. In July of that year he acted as one of the counsel for Dr. John Elliott, Captain Vaughan, and Mr. Mould, who were impeached by the Commons for circulating King James's declaration. He was appointed Attorney-general on 30 March 1693, and was knighted at Kensington on 30 Oct. He was sworn serjeant-at-law on 3 June, and on 8 June 1695 was named lord chief baron of the exchequer. In the following March he was one of the judges who tried Robert Charnock and his associates for treason. He was one of the judges who in January 1700 declined to give an opinion in the so-called \\"bankers' case upon the writ of error\\". In May of the same year he acted as one of the commissioners of the great seal. The most important case over which Ward presided was the trial of Captain William Kidd and his associates for piracy and murder in May 1701. He died at his house in Essex Street, The Strand on 14 July 1714. He was buried at Stoke Doyle, Northamptonshire, where he had purchased the lordship of the manor in 1694. A portrait was engraved by R. White in 1702 from a painting by Godfrey Kneller. Family Ward married, on 30 March 1676, Elizabeth, third daughter of Thomas Papillon. They had ten surviving children. Two of the sons were eminent lawyers. The eldest, Edward, rebuilt Stoke Doyle church and erected in it a monument to his father. Jane, the eldest daughter, married Thomas Hunt of Boreatton, in the parish of Baschurch, Shropshire, and was ancestress of the Ward-Hunt family. His son Thomas, was the consul-general to Russia and agent of the Russia Company. He died suddenly in Moscow in February 1731.

He served during the First and Second World Wars and was Chief of the General Staff of the New Zealand Military Forces from 1949 to 1952. Born in 1896 in Timaru, New Zealand, he joined the New Zealand Military Forces in 1914 as a cadet and served with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force from 1916 in the Middle East for the last two years of the First World War. After the war he held a number of staff positions in New Zealand and abroad. He saw active service during the Second World War as part of the 2nd New Zealand Division. He was made a prisoner of war in August 1944 and spent most of the final months of the war in captivity in Germany. After the war he commanded J Force while it was engaged in occupation duties in Japan. While Chief of General Staff, he oversaw the deployment of New Zealand's military personnel to Korea to assist the United Nations during the Korean War. He retired from the military in 1954 and died in Kawakawa, in 1972. Early life Keith Lindsay Stewart was born in Timaru, South Canterbury on 30 December 1896. His father, David Stewart, was a bank manager. He had a stutter and was educated at Napier Boys' High School and then Wanganui Collegiate. Military career In 1914, Stewart entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon in Australia, having passed its entrance exams. He graduated early to volunteer for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) in 1916. First World War Stewart did not embark for the Middle East until June 1917. Most of his war service was in Egypt, where he was the adjutant of the New Zealand Training Units and Depots there. He also spent a period of time with the headquarters of the Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division, which was serving in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. By the end of the war, he had been promoted to captain and was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire for his services. He returned to New Zealand in December 1919 and his service with the NZEF was terminated. Interwar period After arriving back in New Zealand, Stewart joined the New Zealand Staff Corps. After serving as a staff officer, firstly to the commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces and then in the Central Military District, he attended the Staff College at Camberley, England, for several years. In 1931, he was seconded to the Ceylon Defence Force, where he spent three years as a staff officer. He returned to New Zealand in 1934 and was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his services in Ceylon. He held staff positions in Southern Command, the military district that covered the South Island of New Zealand, until 1939. Second World War Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Stewart was posted to Army Headquarters in Wellington, with responsibility for training and staff duties. Now a lieutenant colonel, he was seconded to the Second Expeditionary Force (2NZEF) in late 1939 and embarked for the Middle East in early 1940 as General Staff Officer for the 2nd New Zealand Division.McClymont, 1959, p. 14 He worked closely with Major General Bernard Freyberg, the divisional commander during the Battle of Greece. After the end of the campaign in Greece, most of the division, including Stewart and Freyberg, was evacuated to Crete. Here, Stewart was promoted to brigadier and served with Creforce as Freyberg's Brigadier General Staff. His services on Crete were recognised with the Distinguished Service Order.Haigh & Polaschek, 1993, p. 244 Stewart returned to New Zealand in late 1941 to take up an appointment as deputy chief of staff, firstly under Major General John Duigan and then Lieutenant General Edward Puttick. His poor health was also a factor in his return. He assisted in preparations to defend New Zealand against an attack by the Japanese Empire. He remained in this position for 18 months before returning to the 2NZEF in August 1943 as commander of the 5th Infantry Brigade.McGibbon, 2000, pp. 512‚Äì513 Stewart commanded the brigade through the early stages of the Italian Campaign before handing over responsibility to Brigadier Howard Kippenberger in November 1943. Stewart then took over command of the 4th Armoured Brigade while its nominal commander, Brigadier Lindsay Inglis, was on furlough in New Zealand.Phillips, 1957, p. 63 When Kippenberger became temporary commander of the 2nd New Zealand Division, Stewart returned to the 5th Infantry Brigade as its commander. He led the brigade through the Battle of Monte Cassino and up until early August 1944, when he was captured by German forces while visiting the front line. He was held in Germany as a prisoner of war until March 1945, when his camp was liberated by Allied Forces. He was mentioned in despatches twice during the course of the war as well as being awarded the United States Legion of Merit and the Greek Military Cross. Postwar career Stewart returned to New Zealand in July 1945, and was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. He commanded the 9th Infantry Brigade from October 1945 to July 1946. The brigade was originally based in the Middle East, but in early 1946 moved to Japan as J Force, New Zealand's contribution to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. After Stewart's period in command ended he returned to New Zealand and was appointed adjutant general of the New Zealand Military Forces. The following year, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1947 New Year Honours. In April 1949, Stewart replaced Major General Norman Weir as Chief of the General Staff, New Zealand Military Forces. He reestablished compulsory military training and advanced plans for the government's commitment to deploy military forces to the Middle East in the event of hostilities with the Soviet Union. This led to a clash with Prime Minister Sydney Holland in 1950 over the rate of progress of these plans for which he later apologised. He also oversaw the deployment of New Zealand forces to Korea following the outbreak of the Korean War. Later life Stewart retired from the military in 1954 but, in a break with convention, he was not rewarded with a knighthood for his services. This was most likely due to his previous clashes with Holland. He was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire four years later by the newly elected Labour Government in the 1958 Queen's Birthday Honours. He retired to Northland and died in the small town of Kawakawa on 13 November 1972. He was survived by his wife Rita, who he had married in 1922, and the couple's two children. He is buried in the servicemen's section of Wellington's Karori Cemetery.

Their deaths were attributed to (witchcraft) motivated by disapproval of having women destined for chiefly office. To avert the curse, Mihi was advised not to marry a local man. Accordingly, in 1896 she married architect Duncan Stirling, originally from Riverton, in the church he had built in Raukokore. The couple had ten children and lived in a large house that Duncan built, locally known as \\"Stirling Castle\\". The Stirlings took up farming in addition to Duncan Stirling's building business. Stirling was an expert in growing exceptionally large k≈´mara by traditional methods, which she supplied to all major local .

When the Canterbury College School of Art (now known as the Ilam School of Fine Arts) opened in 1882, she enrolled, completing her studies in 1890. She was awarded the Second Grade Full Certificate. During this period she became a member of the Palette Club, an association of artists who were committed to working from nature. Career Stoddart began establishing a reputation as one of the country's foremost flower painters, and in 1885 was elected to the council of the Canterbury Society of Arts. In 1886 and 1891 she visited friends in the Chatham Islands. Her travels were recorded in an album which was later presented to the Canterbury Museum. Respected institutions began buying her work. In 1885 the Canterbury Society of Arts bought two of her flower paintings for its permanent collection. In 1890, 12 of her botanical paintings were acquired by the Canterbury Museum. She also exhibited at the Auckland Society of Arts in 1892. In 1894 she travelled to Melbourne, where with support from Ellis Rowan, the Australian flower painter, she held a successful exhibition. Around 1898 Stoddart sailed for England. She stayed in London before moving to live at St Ives in Cornwall, at the time hosting a colony of artists. She spent over nine years painting in Europe, living not only in England, but also France and Italy. Shortly after her arrival, in 1898 or 1899, she went to Norway. She visited France and spent almost a year in Italy in 1905/06. She took lessons from Norman Garstin, Louis Grier and Charles Lasal amongst others and was strongly influenced by the Impressionist movement. In England, Stoddart intermittently met up with Frances Hodgkins, another expatriate artist. In 1903 the two worked together in the English village of Bushey in Hertforshire. Stoddart exhibited with the Royal Institute in London, the Society of Aquarellists in Rome, and in Paris she showed at the Salon of the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Fran√ßais and the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts. At an exhibition in 1902 at the Baillie Gallery, London, her work was singled out for praise by The Sunday Times.

He was born in Dunedin, New Zealand, in 1883. He was the principal of Rangiora High School from 1917-1948, during which time he abolished corporal punishment and the prefect system and introduced the school council, among others. Education In 1903, he entered the Dunedin Training College. He also took classes at the University of Otago, graduating MA with honours in mental science in 1905. Career From 1906 to 1910, he was assistant master in the secondary department of Lawrence District High School, and from 1911 to 1917, he was science master at Gore High School. In 1917, Strachan was appointed principal of Rangiora High School, from where he was able to complete a BSc at Canterbury College (now called the University of Canterbury) in 1921. During his time as principal, he gave more emphasis to existing courses in agriculture, home science and commerce to supplement the traditional professional courses. In 1926 he introduced his 'organic curriculum', which included a central core of science, technology, fine arts and sociology. It was, in part, intended to inculcate social skills such as critical thinking and citizenship. He abolished the prefect system and introduced a school council, which included student representatives. Corporal punishment was replaced by an emphasis on self-discipline. In 1930, he abolished the prize system. Strachan's innovations inevitably encountered opposition. Working-class parents objected to students being encouraged to remain in school, as they wanted their children to become wage-earners as soon as possible. For other parents, good examination passes in subjects such as Latin were seen as passports to tertiary education and to white-collar occupations. Some chose to send their children to school in Christchurch. Hostility also came from officials within the Department of Education. Strachan, however, gained the support of Prime Minister William Massey, who visited the school in 1920, and of ministers of education such as C. J. Parr and Harry Atmore. His reforms were endorsed by a royal commission in 1925; a consultative committee in 1943 recommended that Strachan's system should form the basis of the post-primary curriculum. In the 1947 New Year Honours Strachan was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. He retired in 1948, although he relieved at Greymouth Technical School, Waimate High School and Christ's College. His publications included The school looks at life (1938), an account of the Rangiora experiment. His experiments at Rangiora High School were discontinued by his successor, J. F. Moffatt, but were later widely adopted in the New Zealand school system. Radio Strachan was a notable amateur radio expert. He was credited with having sent New Zealand's first radio signal (the length of a back garden in Dunedin). His interest in the potential of wireless telegraphy to create international goodwill through better communication had led him to develop a school radio station, ZL3AI, where pupils could enhance their knowledge of the new technology while sharing ideas with their counterparts overseas. A lifelong interest in international affairs resulted in his leading the New Zealand delegation to the conference of the Institute of Pacific Relations in 1931. He gained a Carnegie Foundation travel grant to the United States and Europe in 1938. He was also chairman of the reception committee that met Charles Kingsford Smith after his trans-Tasman flight in 1928. Personal life While at Lawrence, he married Mary Irene Chalmers on 2 September 1914. They had one daughter. Mary Strachan died in 1923, and James married Vera Agnes Barrell at Waikuku Beach on 3 January 1934. He enjoyed painting and photography. Death Strachan died at Christchurch on 30 September 1973, survived by his second wife, daughter and two sons. An autobiographical memoir was left uncompleted at his death.

It began in 2010 and was jointly organised by The Substation and Objectifs, presented by The Substation's Moving Images. Created by filmmaker Chai Yee Wei, former Programme Manager of The Substation's Moving Images Low Beng Kheng and current Co-Founder of Objectifs Yuni Hadi, the Singapore Short Film Awards highlights quality work done annually in the short film genre in Singapore - by seeking out new talent, reflecting current standards of the short film genre and to bring together both the veterans and the young talents as a community to create a space for networking and sharing. Official Logo for the Singapore Short Film Awards The SSFA programme traditionally includes a week-long schedule of film screenings and presents all Singapore shorts submitted during an open call for entries starting September to November of every year. The competition accepts films that have been made within the two years before the competition, but screened publicly only the year before the competition. There is a submission fee of $10. Screenings for SSFA are held at The Substation Theatre, with the exception of 2015, where screenings were shifted to The Projector. All screenings are entry by donation. Each year, an Honorary Award is given to an individual or organisation whom had made significant contributions to the Singapore film community through their work in short films. The Awards Ceremony is held following the end of the week-long schedule of screenings, in attendance of a Guest-of-Honour who will typically present the Honorary Award. During the first few editions, SSFA was the only platform that recognised excellence in short films in Singapore. For its 6th edition in 2015, The Substation's Moving Images became the sole organiser of the Singapore Short Film Awards. 1st Singapore Short Film Awards The 1st Singapore Short Film Awards was held from 25‚Äì31 January 2010.

All film entries and nominees were screened at The Substation Theatre. The Awards Ceremony was held on 31 January 2010.

It was organised by SINdie, the only website in Singapore fully dedicated to Singapore independent films and filmmakers, and sponsored by Samuel Seow Law Corporation. The exhibition featured over 100 film posters from about 60 Singapore filmmakers, from the established to the up-and-coming. The exhibition aimed to educate the public about some of the lesser-known filmmakers producing quality work as most Singaporeans were familiar with only a handful of practising filmmakers, and to open up a new branch of film appreciation in Singapore, that of poster art. Visitors could own copies of the various posters for a small contribution to the filmmakers. 3rd Singapore Short Film Awards The 3rd Singapore Short Film Awards was held from 5‚Äì11 March 2012.

She served in several theatres of operations during the war. After the war the ship was retired but the ship's name, pennant number and badge continue to be used by the K147 Baddeck Royal Canadian Sea Cadets Corps. Background Flower-class corvettes like Baddeck serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which ‚Äì in the Royal Navy ‚Äì were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction Named for the village of Baddeck, Nova Scotia, Baddeck was ordered on 22 January 1940 as part of the 1939‚Äì40 Flower-class building program. She was laid down on 14 August 1940 by Davie Shipbuilding and Repairing Co. Ltd. in Lauzon, Quebec and launched on 20 November 1940. Baddeck was commissioned at Quebec City on 18 May 1941. During her service life, she was sent to or held in port on several occasions due to her unreliable engine. After her engine failed for the third time in late 1941, she underwent major repairs during the first half of 1942 to fix the problem.  Wartime career  left After commissioning, Baddeck was sent to Halifax on 29 May 1941. In June 1941 the ship was tasked with escorting SS Lady Rodney from Quebec City to Halifax, but was forced to return to her builders following an engine breakdown. In September 1941, she managed to escort the SS Lady Rodney from Halifax to Jamaica despite again experiencing engine failure. After her repairs were completed she was sent to Newfoundland to serve as an ocean escort. On 5 October 1941 the ship escorted convoy SC 48 from Sydney, Nova Scotia to Iceland. Nine ships were lost to German U-boat attacks near Greenland. On 17 October 1941 HMCS Baddeck rescued two survivors of the Norwegian merchant ship Barfonn after she had been sunk by the . In late 1941 her engines again proved unreliable, and until mid-December she was kept at Hvalfjord, Iceland for repairs. After her work up in June 1942 she served with the Western Local Escort Force (WLEF) until November. In November 1942 the ship arrived in Derry, Northern Ireland and escorted Mediterranean-bound convoys from the United Kingdom for four months. In April 1943 she was assigned to escort group C-4 for two round trips across the Atlantic before transferring back to WLEF in mid-July as part of escort group W-2. In August 1943 the ship underwent a major retrofit at Liverpool, Nova Scotia where her fo'c'sle was extended. She stayed with WLEF until March 1944. left In March 1944 Baddeck was part of the Royal Navy escort group EG-9 based out of Derry, Northern Ireland. In April 1944 the ship was based in Portsmouth as part of Western Approaches Command tasked with invasion escort duties. She was involved in the D-Day landings as part of Operation Neptune. While acting as an invasion escort on 13 June 1944 the ship repulsed an attack by motor torpedo boats. In September 1944 she was assigned to Nore Command based at Sheerness. On 24 May 1945 Baddeck was sent home as her final duty during the war. left  Post-war career  Paid off on 4 July 1945 at Sorel, Quebec, Baddeck was sold into civilian service, becoming the mercantile Efthania in 1947 with a gross register tonnage of 771 tons. She was renamed Yusuf Z. Alireza in 1948 (also spent Yousef Z. Alireza). In 1954, the ship was renamed Al Mansour, and again in 1955 as Radwa. In 1965 she was renamed Evi and sailed under the Greek flag. She ran aground and was wrecked in the Red Sea north of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on 11 March 1966. The ship was broken up in 1966. left The ship's builder's plate is on display at Royal Canadian Legion Branch 53 Nova Scotia/Nunavut Command in Baddeck, Nova Scotia.

He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York and served in the corps of engineers, mostly in Louisiana and Texas. He was an engineer for the Army of Northern Virginia. He was reputed to be the last uniformed man to cross the Mayo Bridge during the evacuation of Richmond, Virginia after the Confederate defenses of Petersburg, Virginia collapsed on April 2, 1865. After the Civil War, Stevens became the superintendent and engineer of the Mexican Imperial Railroad. He died of yellow fever at Vera Cruz, Mexico, November 12, 1867. Early life Walter H.

He was assigned to the Corps of Engineers as a brevet second lieutenant on July 1, 1848. He was appointed a full grade second lieutenant on May 28, 1853 and a first lieutenant on July 1, 1855. Stevens's Southern sympathy is explained by his corps of engineers service mainly in Louisiana and Texas and his marriage to a sister of Confederate Brigadier General Louis Hebert. Stevens offered his resignation from the U.S. Army on March 2, 1861, when Texas passed its ordinance of secession, but it was refused and he was dismissed from the service on a technicality on May 2, 1861.Wert, Jeffry D. \\"Stevens, Walter Husted\\" in Historical Times Illustrated History of the Civil War, edited by Patricia L.

Meanwhile, on March 16, 1861, Stevens had been appointed a captain of engineers in the Army of the Confederate States (the regular army of the Confederate States). American Civil War service Walter H. Stevens was immediately promoted to major in the regular Confederate States Army on March 16, 1861. He was assigned as engineer for the Confederate Army at Pensacola, Florida in April 1861. Between June 1861 and June 1, 1862, he was assigned as engineer in the Confederate Army of the Potomac and, after its change of name, the Army of Northern Virginia. In this capacity he served under General P.G.T. Beauregard at the Battle of First Bull Run (First Manassas) and under General Joseph E. Johnston during the Peninsula Campaign and the Battle of Seven Pines. Stevens was promoted to lieutenant colonel on January 31, 1862. From June 1, 1862 to February 1864, Walter H. Stevens was assigned as engineer in the Department of Richmond, which he strengthened. He was promoted to colonel on March 3, 1863. He was assigned to the Defenses of Richmond, in the Department of Richmond, from February 1864 to July 20, 1864. On July 20, 1864, he returned as chief engineer in the Army of Northern Virginia and served with it through the Siege of Petersburg, strengthening the defenses of that city, and the Appomattox Campaign. Walter Husted Stevens was promoted to brigadier general on August 28, 1864 under the law permitting Confederate President Jefferson Davis to appoint twenty special brigadier generals. Historians Ezra J. Warner and Jeffry D. Wert say Stevens was supposedly the last uniformed man to cross the Mayo Bridge at Richmond, Virginia when the Confederate States Army and Confederate government evacuated Richmond on the night of April 2, 1865 after the fall of the defenses of Petersburg, Virginia at the Battle of Five Forks and the Third Battle of Petersburg. Stevens was paroled at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865. Aftermath After the Civil War, Stevens went to Mexico where he was superintendent and engineer for the Mexican Imperial Railroad, a railroad line planned by Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico to run between Vera Cruz and Mexico City, Mexico. Walter H. Stevens died of yellow fever at Vera Cruz, November 12, 1867. Walter Husted Stevens is buried in Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond Virginia.

In 1837 he started a school at Leven, Perthshire, and two years later entered at the University of St Andrews. Having supported Dr. Thomas Chalmers for the Lord Rectorship after the disruption, he was expelled, with the majority of the students, for refusing to submit to an admonition from the senators. A Royal Commission shortly afterwards reinstated the extruded students, but Dr. Stuart removed from St. Andrews to New College, Edinburgh, where he was a theological student under Dr. Chalmers. In 1844 Stuart was appointed classical master, and subsequently principal, of a private secondary school at Upton Park, Eton, and in July 1848 was married at Slough, Windsor, to Miss Jessie Robertson. He commenced studying for the ministry in London and completed his curriculum in Edinburgh, being licensed by the Free Presbytery of Kelso to the Presbyterian church of Falstone, North Northumberland, where he remained for ten years.

Sutcliffe edited the Australian Psychological Society's magazine and was its president (1925‚Äì1930). He obtained a PhD in psychology, in 1931. He married Hilda Gertrude Wilson in Brunswick on 5 June 1915. Hilda died in Australia in 1944 and in 1955 Herbert married his secretary, Phyllis Evelyn Farley, at Hastings. He took interest in homoeopathy and vitamin therapy. Sutcliffe bought a large house in Havelock North with around of land and lived there with his family and it became the headquarters of his Radiant Living organisation.

Biography Early life Sutherland was born in London on 4 May 1893 to Nellie Miller Sutherland and her husband, David Sutherland, a medical wine manufacturer. Education Sutherland was educated at the City of London School for Girls and the University College of North Wales, Bangor, where she took a Bachelor of Science degree in Forestry. She was the first woman in the both the United Kingdom and the British Empire to complete a Bachelor of Science in forestry. Career During the First World War she served in the Women's National Land Army in Britain. Later she was forewoman forester in estates in Renfrewshire and Inverness-shire. She also served as an assistant experimental officer with the British Forestry Commission. In 1922 she lost her position. This was as a result of reductions in expenditure by the British Forestry Commission brought about by recommendations from Sir Eric Geddes's Committee on National Expenditure . In New Zealand a State Forest Service had been established in 1921. This Service was under the direction of the Canadian- trained forester Leon MacIntosh Ellis. Sutherland was attracted to New Zealand because she felt it offered forestry conditions similar to those in the United Kingdom. She emigrated to New Zealand in about 1924 and attended a three-week introductory course for rangers of the New Zealand Forest Service at Whakarewarewa. During this course Sutherland was required to stay at the Geyer Hotel instead of camp with the other rangers. This attitude to women rangers resulted in a financial disincentive for the Forest Service to send Sutherland into the field. However, despite it she managed to obtain a permanent appointment in 1925 with the Forest Service. She was employed at the Wellington and Rotorua offices to do investigative work in silviculture. In 1924 she had become a member of the Empire Forestry Association and was appointed a Fellow of the Society of Foresters of Great Britain in 1928. In 1929 she undertook research for a paper entitled A microscopical study of the structure of the leaves of the genus pinus, which was published in the Transactions and Proceedings of the New Zealand Institute in 1933. During the years 1933 to 1936 New Zealand was suffering an economic depression which resulted in the Forest Service making severe cutbacks. These retrenchments included Sutherland's specialty area of research. She was laid off, and spent these years working at the Dominion Museum in Wellington. However she did serve on the Council of the New Zealand Forestry League in 1936. Sutherland remained at the Dominion Museum until 1946. Initially working as a clerk, she was eventually obtained a position as a botanist. She presented a paper at the Pacific Science Congress in 1933. In 1937 Sutherland returned to the Forest Service as a botanist. The New Zealand Institute of Foresters (NZIF), established in 1927, lists Sutherland among its founding members. She supported the institute's aims and activities, serving as a councillor in 1935 and as vice-president in 1940-41. Her design of a sprig of fruiting rimu was voted into the NZIF official seal. In 1946 she was seconded to the Department of Agriculture as a farm forestry officer. While in this new position she started her pioneering work in agricultural forestry. She was in charge the layout of plantations at the Department's Winchmore Irrigation Research Station and Invermay Agricultural Research Station. Between 1947 and 1949 she published a significant series of articles in the New Zealand Journal of Agriculture on the advantages to be gained when planting trees on farms. These articles formed the basis for the 1951 Department of Agriculture bulletin on homestead shelter planting. In 1950 she contributed a chapter, Native vegetation, to the Department of Agriculture publication Farming in New Zealand. Death Sutherland's career was cut short when ill heath suffered during field-work in Central Otago during 1954 lead to her death. Sutherland died in Wellington on March 11, 1955.

As a result, the board decide against dismissing him. Unfortunately, one of Weijie and Jianren's \\"inventions\\" falls into criminal hands. This made Weijie, Jianren, Mr CK, his wife and Jianren's mum to travel to Johor Bahru, where Weijie and Jianren are tasked to use the invention to carry S$1000000 (which are actually drugs) by a few of their former gang members. The invention was close to crossing the Singapore-Malaysia border when Mr CK took control. Soon the gang members fought with Weijie, Jianren, Mr CK and Jianren's mum. Jianren's mum asked both Weijie and Jianren to escape while she suffers from an injury. Weijie and Jianren encounters Mr CK's wife, who is about to give birth. While the two are trying to help her give birth, they realised on what they have done wrong towards their parents. Soon after Mr CK's wife gave birth to a healthy baby, Weijie and Jianren are asked to help the police out using their invention to capture the criminals. Once the criminals are captured, Mr CK, his wife and Jianren's mum are admitted to the hospital while Weijie and Jianren thanked her for saving their lives. Once again, Mr CK had hit the headlines and is proclaimed as a national hero. It was then revealed that Weijie and Jianren became winners of a national science competition.

In 1979, she was renamed Coastal Glacier. The vessel eventually was acquired by Matt Pope and Dale Lindsay and renamed Pacesetter. Pacesetter was reported missing in 1996 by the United States Coast Guard Seventeenth District headquartered at Kodiak, Alaska. The search ended with no sign of the boat or her seven-man crew. The loss of Pacesetter was noted as the worst sinking in the Alaskan 1996 snow fishery. Deadliest Catch star Sig Hansen was once briefly employed as the ship's cook, but never went to sea with her after injuring his ankle.Hansen, Sig and Sundeen, Mark (2010). North by Northwestern: A Seafaring Family on Deadly Alaskan Waters', Simon & Schuster Ltd. . As F/V Pacesetter The boat was owned by Pacesetter Mariner, Inc., a family business. Her captain was Matthew Pope. The crew was Stephen Mack, Richard Anderson, Michael Kirk Ericson Sr., Byron Koesterman, Elias Pena, and Stanley Estesad. Pacesetter had a normal \\"mud boat\\" stern like other Bender crab boats. The wheelhouse had just been raised and a full maintenance and paint routine was done in the MINI Shipyard and Foss Shipyards the summer before the boat was lost. The disappearance On 27 January 1996 at 00:32, Pacesetter was reported missing. United States Coast Guard District 17 at Kodiak, Alaska, picked up an emergency position-indicating radiobeacon station (EPIRB) distress beacon. All U.S. Coast Guard assets were sent out to find the missing crabber. At 06:40, a U.S. Coast Guard Sikorsky HH-60 Jayhawk helicopter sighted an EPIRB beacon. At 7:12, nearby vessels spotted a life raft but no sign of the crew. At 07:47, a second life raft was found partially submerged and not inflated. At 08:06, searchers found a buoy float with the boat's name on it. The U.S. Coast Guard called off the search after two days. Investigation A partner boat reported seeing Pacesetter roll from side to side. The U.S. Coast Guard found that the vessel was overloaded with crab pots. Pope had loaded the boat with pots at Dutch Harbor, Alaska, to the boat's supposed maximum. He then left the harbor and picked up an estimated 22 more bait pots on his way to the fishing grounds. Witnesses reported that the boat was rolling so hard that they could see the rolling chalks on the bottom of the boat. From the testimony of crews from other boats and pot yard records, the Coast Guard ruled the vessel was overloaded and traveling in adverse weather conditions when she heeled, rolled over, and sank. Similar incidents A number of incidents over the previous decade bore a similarity to the loss of Pacesetter: *On 19 September 1987 the stern trawler Nordfjord ‚Äì also built by Signal Ship Repair ‚Äì disappeared without a trace with the loss of her entire crew of five after sending a brief mayday. *On 29 January 1989 the crabber Vestfjord sent a mayday about ice accumulation and was lost. *On 11 February 1991, the Barbarossa vanished with her entire crew of six. *On 15 January 1995, the Seattle, Washington-based crab boat Northwest Mariner was found capsized. The boat had six crew members. A life raft was found next to the inverted boat with two unconscious crew members on it who then died of hypothermia. The four others were never found.

The formation outcrops on the flank of Sierra de Villicum in the Argentina precordillera.The Paleobiology database \\"Sierra de Villicum\\" entry accessed 17 January 2012 Generally the shells of Hemiconcavodonta minuta are ovate to rounded and moderately inflated. The small shells have an umbo positioned subcentrally on the posterior edge of the shell and nine to ten teeth in the hinge structure. H. minuta ranges in shell length from and has a height between . As a member of Concavodontinae, the hinge displays the chevroning of teeth typical of the subfamily. The teeth have a concavity in the chevron which faces away from the center of the hinge and the umbo. However the teeth of Hemiconcavodonta are unique in the subfamily with only the posterior teeth being concavodont, while the anterior teeth are convexodont thus facing towards the hinges center. The genus name is in reference to the tooth structure being both concavodont and convexodont. The overall small size of H. minuta shells is the basis for the etymology of the specific name. A solitary fossil from the same location as H. minuta has the same convexodont/concavodont tooth structure as H. minuta. However the placement of the umbo and anterior adductor muscle plus tooth size in the solitary fossil do not match H. minuta and thus S√°nchez did not place the specimen into H. minuta.

The type genus Concavodonta is composed of three species found in Bavaria, France, and Argentina. The second genus, Emiliodonta, and third genus Hemiconcavodonta are both monotypic, and known only from the Argentine precordillera. Concavodonta is a small bivalve which was first described in 1972 by Claude Babin and Michel Melou. The structuring of the shell in Concavodonta has been noted to be anomalous. While several specimens from other taxa, such as Praeleda costae and Ctenodonta have been found with occasional concavodont teeth, they are not typical.

Causes  The Brunei Civil War was triggered by a cockfight During the reign of the thirteenth Sultan Muhammad Ali, there was a disagreement between the son of the Sultan, Pengiran Muda (\\"prince\\") Bongsu and Pengiran Muda Alam, the son of Pengiran Abdul Mubin over the results of a cockfight which Pengiran Muda Bungsu lost. His defeat was jeered by Pengiran Muda Alam. In his rage, Bongsu killed Pengiran Muda Alam and escaped from the scene. In revenge, Abdul Hakkul Mubin and his followers garroted Sultan Muhammad Ali. Abdul Hakkul Mubin then made himself the fourteenth Sultan and took the title of \\"Sultan Abdul Hakkul Mubin\\". He tried to appease the previous Sultan's followers by appointing Muhammad Ali's grandson, Muhyiddin as the new Bendahara (\\"Chief Minister\\"). After a while, however, Muhammad Ali's supporters took revenge by convincing Bendahara Muhyiddin to stand up against Abdul Hakkul Mubin. Bendahara Muhyddin initially refused, but then later agreed to do so. His supporters started making disturbances in the form of poking spears into palaces and homes. Sultan Abdul Hakkul Mubin then moved his palace to Chermin Island under the advice of Muhyiddin with the intent to wait the crisis out. After he left, however, Muhyiddin declared himself the fifteenth sultan. A battle between the two competing Sultans then ensued. Thus, the civil war of Brunei started.  Fighting and outcome  During the Civil War, Abdul Hakkul Mubin fled to Kinarut (in present-day Papar, Sabah, Malaysia) where, he stayed there for ten years, repelling repeated attacks by Sultan Muhyiddin. They returned to Brunei after a final attack by Muhyiddin's forces in which they failed to defeat Abdul Hakkul Mubin. Muhyiddin was concerned that the civil war was dragging on too long and asked the help of the sultan of Sulu to send forces. He reportedly promised the land of eastern Sabah as a reward for the Sulu's assistance. Muhyiddin eventually emerged victorious. Abdul Hakkul Mubin was killed in the civil war. It is not clear to historians whether Muhyiddin asked for Sulu‚Äôs help in the civil war. The Sultan of Sulu at that time on his part, however, claimed that he was asked by Brunei to help and was promised eastern Sabah as a reward. Sultan of Sulu claimed eastern Sabah as a gift from the Sultan of Brunei, for the Tausugs' despite that they never really help during the civil war (an event which traced the roots of the North Borneo dispute between Malaysia and the Philippines in the present-day).

Cruse and his men were temporarily taken prisoner. In July 1673, Cruse was sent to aid a group of burghers who had come under attack from the tribal warlord Gonnema. The burghers had been slain long before the rescue party arrived, but Cruse had also been tasked with leading a retributive attack. He and his men attempted an attack on Gonnema's kraal, but the warlord and his men escaped to the mountains and Cruse had to be content with capturing their livestock.

The film was directed by Katsuhide Motoki, and stars Rena Tanaka, Mayuko Fukuda and Etsushi Toyokawa. Rena Tanaka and Mayuko Fukuda play the adult and the young version of Akari Saito respectively, while actor Etsushi Toyokawa stars as Akari's father. Based on a novel by Hare Kawaguchi, this film tells the story of Akari Saito and her dog named Socks. The pair supported each other as they grew up together. This story is closely tied to \\"The Ten Commandments of Dog Ownership\\", a list of ownership rules written from a dog's point of view. 10 Promises to My Dog was released in the Japanese box office on 15 March 2008. The film grossed a total of US$15,332,225 in 6 countries, and was the 19th-highest grossing Japanese film of 2008. Plot Akari is neglected by her father, a top surgeon who works long hours and puts his career before family. Her mother is hospitalized because of an incurable disease. Therefore, Akari longs for a dog who can keep her company. One day, a Golden Retriever puppy unexpectedly appears in the garden of Akari's house, and Akari immediately decides to adopt it. At her mother's suggestion, Akari christens it \\"Socks\\", because the puppy's white paws made it look like it was wearing white socks. Her mother also makes Akari promise that she will follow The Ten Commandments of Dog Ownership when she takes care of Socks. Akari also has a friend, Susumu, who is trained by his family to become a professional guitarist. Susumu soon forms an attachment with Socks as well. A few months later, Akari's mother dies, and Akari grieves over her death for two days. After that, her neck becomes very stiff and she is unable to move it. With Socks' help, she realizes that this stiffness is actually due to her own imagination, and is thus \\"cured\\". She also finds out that Socks was actually placed in the garden by her mother. Not long after Akari's mother died, the family moves to Sapporo because her father was given a lecturer post at a university there. However, they cannot bring Socks along because their dormitory does not allow pets. Hence, Akari has to reluctantly entrust Socks to the care of Susumu. Another problem surfaces when Susumu is accepted into a prestigious music school in Paris. On the day that he is leaving, Akari's father, who was supposed to be on leave that day, is suddenly called back to the hospital to do an \\"emergency\\" operation. This causes Akari to be late in seeing Susumu off. The \\"emergency\\" operation turns out to be a minor one, and he resigns after feeling guilty about disappointing his daughter. The family later moves back to their old home in Hakodate, and Socks comes back to stay with them. Akari's father later sets up a clinic in the home, which proves to be popular with the locals. 10 years later, Akari is a university student studying to become a vet. By chance, she happens to see a poster advertising Susumu's upcoming performance in the city. The pair have a tearful reunion, and they soon start dating. During this time, she starts to feel that Socks is a constrain to her. She starts to bemoan the sacrifices that she has to make because of Socks. After Akari graduates from university, she becomes a zookeeper at Asahiyama Zoo. Akari seldom returns to her home, and neglects Socks in the process. However, she is reminded of the good friend Socks was when the dog helps Susumu gain enough confidence to play the guitar again after his accident. As time passes, Socks starts to age and becomes weaker. Akari is shocked at how much weaker Socks looks on one of her rare visits home, and promises to visit it often. However, due to her heavy workload, she is unable to fulfill that promise. One day, her father phones her urgently to tell her that Socks was dying. Managing to get away from her work, she rushes back just in time. As its energy saps away, Akari reads the Ten Commandments of Dog Ownership again to see if she had done what she had promised 10 years ago. After Socks' death, Akari and her father find long-lost photographs of Socks, and a letter from her mother. The letter tells Akari that Socks was meant to replace herself, though she added that Socks will not live as long as Akari. Akari is also reminded of the fact that her father sacrificed his career for her. Not long after, Akari and Susumu get married together.

This novel was in turn inspired by a set of rules entitled \\"The Ten Commandments of Dog Ownership\\". Reception Kevin Ma, reviewer for Love HK Film.com, describes director Katsuhide Motoki's approach to the story \\"very low-key and matter-of-fact\\", and added that \\"it almost feels like he decided to tell the story in a way that any director-for- hire would\\". He also criticized some of the characters. In particular, he said that Rena Tanaka \\"barely registers as the central character\\" and that \\"Ryo Kase fares even worse [than Rena Tanaka], but mostly because of his poorly- written plot device of a character than his acting skills in general.\\" However, he did praise the child actors, saying that Mayuko Fukuda gives \\"the best performance as the child Akari\\". He also praised the ending of the film, describing it as \\"emotionally powerful and yet brilliantly understated\\".

In the summer semester of 1462, when he was about eight years old, he was enrolled at the University of Greifswald. This was shortly after a long-running dispute had been settled between the city of Greifswald and the Dukes Wartislaw X and his brother Eric II.Martin Wehrmann: Geschichte von Pommern, vol. 2, 2nd ed., Verlag Friedrich Andreas Perthes, Gotha, 1921, reprinted: Augsburg, 1992, , p. 210 The University had been founded by Swantbor's grandfather, Wartislaw IX; Swantibor was the first member of the House of Griffins to be enrolled here. In the winter semester of 1462‚Äì1463, Swantibor was elected rector of the University, to honor his grandfather. In 1464, Swantibor died of the plague. His younger brother Ertmar died at the same time. Their father had no other children; their mother had a son, Duke Otto III from an earlier marriage to Duke Joachim the Younger. However, Otto III was also killed by the plague in 1464.  Ancestors   Numeral  The assignment of numerals to the Dukes in the House of Griffins had always been complicated. Confusion is caused by different authors assigning different numerals to the dukes.Martin Wehrmann: Genealogie des pommerschen Herzogshauses, Verlag Leon Sauniers Buchhandlung, Stettin, 1937, p. 15. The modern approach is to assign numerals only to members of the House of Griffins who reached adulthood. Under this approach, Swantibor would not be assigned a numeral. Older sources, however, assigned numerals to all males members of the house. Under that approach, this Swantibor would be Swantibor V.

Early life Born about 1632, was the second son of Francis Prichard of Southwark, and his wife, Mary Eggleston. He is described as merchant taylor and alderman of Broad Street. Local politician and mayor In 1672 Prichard was Sheriff of London, and he was knighted on 23 October in that year. On 29 September 1682 he went to the poll as court candidate for the mayoralty, and on 4 October the recorder declared him third on the list, below Sir Thomas Gold and Alderman Henry Cornish, both Whigs. But a scrutiny of the poll gave him the first place. On the 25th he was declared elected by the court of aldermen, and on the 28th was sworn in at the Guildhall Prichard's election was celebrated as a great triumph for the court party, in loyal ballads and congratulatory poems. One of these \\"new loyal songs and catches\\" was set to music by Henry Purcell. In office as mayor, Prichard carried on the policy of his predecessor, John Moore (Lord Mayor). He refused to admit to their offices the recently elected whig sheriffs, Thomas Papillon and John Dubois, whose election he had assisted Moore in setting aside. When, in February 1684, proceedings were taken against him by the Whigs, he refused to appear or give bail, and on 24 April was arrested by the sheriff's officers at Grocers' Hall; he was detained in custody for six hours. The arrest caused a furore and the corporation was forced to disclaim any part in it by an order in common council on 22 May. Prichard retaliated by an action for false and malicious arrest against Papillon (Dubois being now dead). The case was tried before George Jeffreys at the Guildhall on 6 November 1684, the law-officers of the crown appearing for the plaintiff, and Serjeant John Maynard for the defendant. Jeffreys summed up strongly in favour of Prichard, who was awarded ¬£10,000. damages. Papillon fled the country to escape payment. Prichard declared his willingness to release him from the effects of the judgment, with the king's assent; this was long refused by James II, but was ultimately granted in 1688, when, on 7 August, Sir William gave a full release to Papillon at Garraway's coffee-house, drinking his former foe's health . Meanwhile, Prichard had lost favour at court. In August 1687 he, with other aldermen, was displaced for opposing the king's moves for liberty of conscience. He appears to have been restored later; but in October 1688 he refused to act as intermediary mayor. Member of Parliament On 15 May 1685 and in March 1690 Prichard was returned as one of the Members of Parliament for the City of London. After the Glorious Revolution Prichard continued active as Tory and churchman. In June 1690 he made an unsuccessful attempt to keep the Whig Sir John Pilkington out of the mayoralty; and in October 1698 and January 1701 he was an unsuccessful parliamentary candidate for the City; but he was returned at the head of the poll on 18 August 1702. Death and legacy Prichard died at his city residence in Heydon Yard, Minories, on 20 February 1705. His body was conveyed from his house at Highgate to Great Linford in Buckinghamshire, where it was buried on 1 March in a vault under the north aisle. An inscription on a marble slab recorded that Prichard was president of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and that he erected there \\"a convenient apartment for cutting the stone\\". In Great Linford itself, the manor of which he had acquired in 1683 from the family of Richard Napier, Prichard founded and endowed an almshouse and school-buildings, and his widow increased his benefaction. Prichard's portrait was at Merchant Taylors' Hall. Family By his wife, Sarah Coke of Kingsthorp, Northamptonshire, he had three sons and a daughter. She also was buried at Great Linford on 6 May 1718. In accordance with Prichard's will, the Buckinghamshire estates passed to Richard Uthwart and Daniel King, his nephews.

A hydrophobic membrane presents a barrier for the liquid phase, allowing the vapour phase (e.g. water vapour) to pass through the membrane's pores. The driving force of the process is a partial vapour pressure difference commonly triggered by a temperature difference. Principle of membrane distillation Most processes that use a membrane to separate materials rely on static pressure difference as the driving force between the two bounding surfaces (e.g. reverse osmosis - RO), or a difference in concentration (dialysis), or an electric field (ED). The selectivity of a membrane can be due to the relation of the pore size to the size of the substance being retained, or its diffusion coefficient, or its electrical polarity. Membranes used for membrane distillation (MD) inhibit passage of liquid water while allowing permeability for free water molecules and thus, for water vapour. These membranes are made of hydrophobic synthetic material (e.g. PTFE, PVDF or PP) and offer pores with a standard diameter between 0.1 and 0.5 ¬µm. As water has strong dipole characteristics, whilst the membrane fabric is non-polar, the membrane material is not wetted by the liquid. Even though the pores are considerably larger than the molecules, the high water surface tension prevents the liquid phase from entering the pores. A convex meniscus develops into the pore. This effect is named capillary action. Amongst other factors, the depth of impression can depend on the external pressure load on the liquid. A dimension for the infiltration of the pores by the liquid is the contact angle Œò=90 ‚Äì Œò'. As long as Œò < 90¬∞ and accordingly Œò' > 0¬∞ no wetting of the pores will take place. If the external pressure rises above the so-called liquid entry pressure, then Œò = 90¬∞resulting in a bypass of the pore. The driving force which delivers the vapour through the membrane, in order to collect it on the permeate side as product water, is the partial water vapour pressure difference between the two bounding surfaces. This partial pressure difference is the result of a temperature difference between the two bounding surfaces. As can be seen in the image, the membrane is charged with a hot feed flow on one side and a cooled permeate flow on the other side. The temperature difference through the membrane, usually between 5 and 20 K, conveys a partial pressure difference which ensures that the vapour developing at the membrane surface follows the pressure drop, permeating through the pores and condensing on the cooler side.Joachim Koschikowski: Entwicklung von energieautark arbeitenden Wasserentsalzungsanlagen auf Basis der Membrandestillation Fraunhofer Verlag, 2011, 3839602602 Membrane distillation techniques Many different membrane distillation techniques exist. The basic four techniques mainly differ by the arrangement of their distillate channel or the manner in which this channel is operated. The following technologies are most common: *Direct Contact MD (DCMD) *Air Gap MD (AGMD) *Vacuum MD (VMD) *Sweeping Gas MD (SWGMD) *Vacuum multi-effect membrane distillation (V-MEMD) *Permeate Gap MD (PGMD) Direct-contact MD In DCMD, both sides of the membrane are charged with liquid- hot feed water on the evaporator side and cooled permeate on the permeate side. The condensation of the vapour passing through the membrane happens directly inside the liquid phase at the membrane boundary surface. Since the membrane is the only barrier blocking the mass transport, relatively high surface related permeate flows can be achieved with DCMD. A disadvantage is the high sensible heat loss, as the insulating properties of the single membrane layer are low. However, a high heat loss between evaporator and condenser is also the result of the single membrane layer. This lost heat is not available to the distillation process, thus lowering the efficiency. Unlike other configurations of membrane distillation, in DCMD the cooling across the membrane is provided by permeate flow rather than feed preheating. Therefore, an external heat exchanger is also needed to recover heat from the permeate, and the high flow rate of the feed must be carefully optimized. Air-gap MD Droplet condensation regimes seen in AGMD. In air-gap MD, the evaporator channel resembles that in DCMD, whereas the permeate gap lies between the membrane and a cooled walling and is filled with air. The vapour passing through the membrane must additionally overcome this air gap before condensing on the cooler surface. The advantage of this method is the high thermal insulation towards the condenser channel, thus minimizing heat conduction losses. However, the disadvantage is that the air gap represents an additional barrier for mass transport, reducing the surface- related permeate output compared to DCMD. A further advantage over DCMD is that volatile substances with a low surface tension such as alcohol or other solvents can be separated from diluted solutions, due to the fact that there is no contact between the liquid permeate and the membrane with AGMD. AGMD is especially advantageous compared to alternatives at higher salinity. Variations on AGMD can include hydrophobic condensing surfaces for improved flux and energy efficiency. In AGMD, uniquely important design features include gap thickness, condensing surface hydrophobicity, gap spacer design, and tilt angle. Sweeping-gas MD Sweeping-gas MD, also known as air stripping, uses a channel configuration with an empty gap on the permeate side. This configuration is the same as in AGMD. Condensation of the vapour takes place outside the MD module in an external condenser. As with AGMD, volatile substances with a low surface tension can be distilled with this process. The advantage of SWGMD over AGMD is the significant reduction of the barrier to the mass transport through forced flow. Hereby higher surface-related productwater mass flows can be achieved than with AGMD. A disadvantage of SWGMD caused by the gas component and therefore the higher total mass flow, is the necessity of a higher condenser capacity. When using smaller gas mass flows there is a risk of the gas heating itself at the hot membrane surface, thus reducing the vapour pressure difference and therefore the driving force. One solution of this problem for SWGMD and for AGMD is the use of a cooled walling for the permeate channel, and maintaining temperature by flushing it with gas. Vacuum MD Vacuum MD contains an air gap channel configuration. Once it has passed through the membrane, the vapour is sucked out of the permeate channel and condenses outside the module as with SWGMD. VCMD and SWGMD can be applied for the separation of volatile substances from a watery solution or for the generation of pure water from concentrated salt water. One advantage of this method is that undissolved inert gasses blocking the membrane pores are sucked out by the vacuum, leaving a larger effective membrane surface active. Furthermore, a reduction of the boiling point results in a comparable amount of product at lower overall temperatures and lower temperature differences through the membrane. A lower required temperature difference leaves a lower total- and specific thermal energy demand. However, the generation of a vacuum, which must be adjusted to the salt water temperature, requires complex technical equipment and is therefore a disadvantage to this method. The electrical energy demand is a lot higher as with DCMD and AGMD. An additional problem is the increase of the pH value due to the removal of CO2 from the feed water. For vacuum membrane distillation to be efficient, it is often run in multistage configurations. Permeate-gap MD In the following, the principle channel configuration and operating method of a standard DCMD module as well as a DCMD module with separate permeate gap shall be explained. The design in the adjacent image depicts a flat channel configuration, but can also be understood as a schema for flat-, hollow fibre - or spiral wound modules. The complete channel configuration consists of a condenser channel with inlet and outlet and an evaporator channel with inlet and outlet. These two channels are separated by the hydrophobic, micro porous membrane. For cooling, the condenser channel is flooded with fresh water and the evaporator e.g. with salty feed water. The coolant enters the condenser channel at a temperature of 20 ¬∞C. After passing through the membrane, the vapour condenses in the cooling water, releasing its latent heat and leading to a temperature increase in the coolant. Sensible heat conduction also heats the cooling water through the surface of the membrane. Due to the mass transport through the membrane the mass flow in the evaporator decreases whilst the condenser channel increases by the same amount. The mass flow of pre-heated coolant leaves the condenser channel at a temperature of about 72 ¬∞C and enters a heat exchanger, thus pre-heating the feed water. This feed water is then delivered to a further heat source and finally enters the evaporator channel of the MD module at a temperature of 80 ¬∞C. The evaporation process extracts latent heat from the feed flow, which cools down the feed increasingly in flow direction. Additional heat reduction occurs due to sensible heat passing through the membrane. The cooled feed water leaves the evaporator channel at approximately 28 ¬∞C. Total temperature differences between condenser inlet and evaporator outlet and condenser inlet and evaporator outlet are about equal. In a PGMD module, the permeate channel is separated from the condenser channel by a condensation surface. This enables the direct use of a salt water feed as coolant, since it does not come into contact with the permeate. Considering this, the cooling-or feed water entering the condenser channel at a temperature T1 can now also be used to cool the permeate. Condensation of vapour takes place inside the liquid permeate. Pre-heated feed water that was used to cool the condenser can be conducted directly to a heat source for final heating, after leaving the condenser at a temperature T2. After it has reached temperature T3 it is guided into the evaporator. Permeate is extracted at temperature T5 and the cooled brine is discharged at temperature T4. An advantage of PGMD over DCMD is the direct use of feed water as cooling liquid inside the module and therefore the necessity of only one heat exchanger to heat the feed before entering the evaporator. Hereby heat conduction losses are reduced and expensive components can be cut. A further advantage is the separation of permeate from coolant. Therefore, the permeate does not have to be extracted later in the process and the coolant's mass flow in the condenser channel remains constant. The low flow velocity of the permeate in the permeate gap is a disadvantage of this configuration, as it leads to a poor heat conduction from the membrane surface to the condenser walling. High temperatures on the permeate side's membrane bounding surface are the result of this effect (temperature polarisation), which lowers the vapour pressure difference and therefore the driving force of the process. However, it is beneficial, that the heat conduction losses through the membrane are also lowered by this effect. This poor gap heat conduction challenge is largely removed with a variant of PGMD called CGMD, or conductive gap membrane distillation, which adds thermally conductive spacers to the gaps. Compared to AGMD, in PGMD or CGMD, a higher surface related permeate output is achieved, as the mass flow is not additionally inhibited by the diffusion resistance of an air layer. Vacuum multi-effect membrane distillation The hydrophobic membranes (or PP foils) are welded at both sides of the memsys frame. This frame are designed to combine and distribute vapor, feed, non condensable gas and distillate flows. vibration welded as memsys module (e.g. steam raiser, membrane stage and condenser). GOR and capacity of memsys module can be easily modified deponding on the application or customer's needs. Diagram of memsys V-MEMD process The typical vacuum multi-effect membrane distillation (e.g. the memsys brand V-MEMD) module consists of a steam raiser, evaporation‚Äìcondensation stages, and a condenser. Each stage recovers the heat of condensation, providing a multiple-effect design. Distillate is produced in each evaporation‚Äìcondensation stage and in the condenser. Steam raiser: The heat produced by the external heat source (e.g. solar thermal or waste heat) is exchanged in the steam raiser. The water in the steam raiser is at lower pressure (e.g. 400 mbar), compared to the ambient. The hot steam flows to the first evaporation‚Äìcondensation stage (stage 1). Evaporation‚Äìcondensation stages: Stages are composed of alternative hydrophobic membrane and foil (Polypropylene, PP) frames. Feed (e.g. seawater) is introduced into stage 1 of the module. Feed flows serially through the evaporation‚Äìcondensation stages. At the end of last stage, it is ejected as brine. Stage 1: Steam from the evaporator condenses on a PP foil at pressure level P1 and corresponding temperature T1. The combination of a foil and a hydrophobic membrane creates a channel for the feed, where the feed is heated by the heat of condensation of the vapour from the steam raiser. Feed evaporates under the negative pressure P2. The vacuum is always applied to the permeate side of the membranes. Stage [2, 3, 4, x]: This process is replicated in further stages and each stage is at a lower pressure and temperature. Condenser: The vapour produced in the final evaporation‚Äìcondensation stage is condensed in the condenser, using the coolant flow (e.g. seawater). Distillate production: Condensed distillate is transported via the bottom of each stage by pressure difference between stages. Design of memsys module: Inside each memsys frame, and between frames, channels are created. Foil frames are the ‚Äòdistillate channels‚Äô. Membrane frames are the ‚Äòvapour channels‚Äô. Between foil and membrane frames, ‚Äòfeed channels‚Äô are created. Vapour enters the stage and flows into parallel foil frames. The only option of for the vapour entering the foil frames is to condense, i.e. vapour enters a ‚Äòdead-end‚Äô foil frame. Although it is called a ‚Äòdead-end‚Äô frame, it does contain a small channel to remove the non- condensable gases and to apply the vacuum. The condensed vapour flows into a distillate channel. The heat of condensation is transported through the foil and is immediately converted into evaporation energy, generating new vapour in the seawater feed channel. The feed channel is limited by one condensing foil and a membrane. The vapour leaves the membrane channels and is collected in a main vapour channel. The vapour leaves the stage via this channel and enters the next stage. Memsys has developed a highly automated production line for the modules and could be easily extended. As the memsys process works at modest low temperatures (<90 ¬∞C) and moderate negative pressure, all module components are made of polypropylene (PP). This eliminates corrosion and scaling and allows large-scale cost efficient production. Applications Typical applications of membrane distillation are: *Seawater desalination *Brackish water desalination *Desalination brine treatment *Process water treatment *Water purification *Removal/Concentration of ammonium *Resource concentration Solar-powered membrane distillation Plant design of a compact system Plant design of a two loop system Membrane distillation is very suitable for compact, solar powered desalination units providing small and medium range output <10000 l/day. Especially the spiral wound design patented by GORE in the year 1985 suits this application. Within the MEMDIS project, which kicked off in 2003, the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE began developing MD modules as well as installing and analysing two different solar powered operating systems, together with other project partners. The first system type is a so-called compact system, designed to produce a drinking water output of 100-120 l/day from sea-or brackish water. The main aim of the system design is a simple, self-sufficient, low maintenance and robust plant for target markets in arid and semi-arid areas of low infrastructure. The second system type is a so-called two-loop plant with a capacity of around 2000 l/day. Here, the collector circuit is separated from the desalination circuit by a saltwater resistant heat exchanger. Based on these two system types, a various number of prototypes were developed, installed and observed. The standard configuration of today's (2011) compact system is able to produce a distillate output of up to 150 l/day. The required thermal energy is supplied by a 6.5 m¬≤ solar thermal collector field. Electrical energy is supplied by a 75 W PV-module. This system type is currently being developed further and marketed by the Solar Spring GmbH, a spin-off of the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems. Within the MEDIRAS project, a further EU-project, an enhanced two-loop system was installed on the Island of Gran Canaria. Built inside a 20 ft container and equipped with a collector aray size of 225 m¬≤, a heat storage tank makes a distillate output of up to 3000 l/day possible. Further applications with up to 5000 l/day have also been implemented, either 100% solar powered or as hybrid projects in combination with waste heat. Exemplary systems {  } Challenges The operation of membrane distillation systems faces several major barriers that may impair operation, or prevent it from being a viable option. The principal challenge is membrane wetting, where saline feed leaks through the membrane, contaminating the permeate. This is especially caused by membrane fouling, where particulates, salts, or organic manner deposit on the membrane surface. Techniques to mitigate fouling include membrane superhydrophobicity, air backwashing to reverse or prevent wetting, choosing non-fouling operating conditions, and maintaining air layers on the membrane surface. The single biggest challenge for membrane distillation to be cost effective is the energy efficiency. Commercial systems have not reached competitive energy consumption compared to the leading thermal technologies such as Multiple-effect distillation, although some have been close, and research has shown potential for significant improvements on energy efficiency.

It opened on September 18, 2003. Exhibits of the museum of the history of Turkic script are focused on learning the history of letters. Gathered here is the rich heritage of world culture-samples used by Turkic peoples of the Eurasian space. The co-founders of the nomadic Eurasian civilization of Turkic peoples in history have suggested the idea of \\"Eternal Ale\\". They spoke the 26 related languages that originated from one root, and used 16 writing systems since ancient times. The first Turkic words were recorded in letters and became the basis for the further evolution of the Turkic language system back in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. Among the valuable exhibits of the museum are inscriptions on stones of different periods, from the Kangly era (2nd century BC) until the 19th century. They were brought from Mongolia, Xian, and Altay.  Study-museum of Lev Gumilyov  Study-museum of Lev Gumilyov at the university opened on October 1, 2002.

They are later attacked by a bizarre, aggressive, and sharp-toothed rabbit, which manages to wound Kris before it is killed by the gang. Confused, the group returns to their camp. Later that evening, Mel, one of the girls, goes skinny dipping into a local pond but is attacked by leeches. At night, she gets an extraordinarily high fever, her teeth start falling out, and she bleeds uncontrollably. The following day, armed with knife-like teeth, superhuman strength, savage and animalistic behaviour and hunger for flesh, the now mutant Mel attacks her friends. They attempt to detain and subdue her, but she escapes, killing Warren and eating him. In an attempt to run away from Mel, Dace hides in the same pond, but Anja, Kris, and Chad frantically get him out of the water. Thinking that the leeches carry the parasite that turned Mel \\"primal\\" and finding no leeches on Dace, they assume Dace is safe. That night, as the survivors plot their escape, Dace suddenly gets the same sickness Mel experienced before becoming \\"primal\\". The friends debate who kills their friend before he mutates. However, sensing Dace's imminent transformation (and probably a male partner to mate with), the mutant Mel attacks the survivors and saves Dace and hides him where he can \\"die\\" and transform safely before they get the chance to kill him. The group still finds Dace, but Mel succeeds in protecting him because of Chad's refusal to accept that Mel, his girlfriend, is dead and the parasite is all that remains of her. The reanimated and mutant brainless Dace chases Kris. Then, the mutant Dace and Mel meet for the first time as fully transformed mutants and they \\"sacrifice\\" Kris into the cave. Anja figures out that the mutants are afraid of the cave for some reason. So, Chad and Anja, the two remaining survivors, hitch a plan to escape by passing through the cave. As the two attempt to scurry past the two mutants as they feast on what remains of their friend Warren, their plan falls apart when the mutant Dace and the mutant Mel begin to have sex. Despite Anja warning Chad that \\"it's not them anymore\\", the sight triggers so much jealousy and anger in Chad that he attacks the mutants. Both mutant Dace and Chad are killed in the ensuing battle. Anja flees and ventures into the cave, where she discovers Kris, who has been impregnated by a monster, presumably the source of the parasites in the pond. Kris slices her own stomach to kill the \\"child\\" while Anja kills the monster itself. Later, in the morning, Anja encounters the mutant Mel one last time. In their duel Anja paralyzes Mel by kicking her into a tree and snapping her spine. Anja kills Mel by grabbing a big rock and dropping it on Mel's head, crushing her skull.

Initially the organization was known as the People's Organizing Provisional Office. The organization was conceptualized not as a political party, but as a \\"popular revolutionary front\\".Clapham Christopher. Transformation and Continuity in Revolutionary Ethiopia. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988. p. 66 The Yekatit '66 Political School, an institution under the supervision of POMOA, trained political cadres. POMOA functioned as a government department, and received allocations from the state treasury. According to Kiflu Tadesse, POMOA had an annual budget of 7 million Birr.Tadesse, Kiflu. Ethiopia Transformation and Conflict. Silver Spring, Md: K & S Distributors [u.a.], 1998. p. 56 Leadership and structure Through POMOA the Derg military junta received political support (in the face of opposition from the EPRP), especially through the building of organizational structures in the provinces. But the Derg was wary of the dominance of the All-Ethiopian Socialist Movement (Meison) over POMOA. As a means of keeping POMOA under check, Mengistu Haile Mariam employed tactics of playing out different POMOA factions against each other. The leading body in POMOA was a 15-member committee. Its full name was the Mass Political Education and Co- ordinating Committee.Tiruneh, Andargachew. The Ethiopian Revolution 1974‚Äì1987 : a Transformation from an Aristocratic to a Totalitarian. Cambridge: University of Cambridge, 1995. p. 162 It was commonly referred to as the 'Politburo', and had many scholars within its ranks.Bulcha, Mekuria.

The activities of POMOA supervised by Supreme Organizing Committee, a body chaired by Mengistu himself. Membership in POMOA was kept secret. Five political groups were active inside POMOA; Meison, Waz League, the Ethiopian Marxist-Leninist Revolutionary Organization (Malerid), Echat and Seded. The entry of Seded (the political faction started by the Derg military officers) caused controversy within the coalition. Two factions (Meison and Echat) opposed the entry of Seded into the alliance (seeing Seded as a threat to their influence in POMOA) whilst the other two (Malerid and Waz League) supported the integration of Seded.Clapham Christopher. Transformation and Continuity in Revolutionary Ethiopia. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988. p. 67 The different member organizations of POMOA conspired against each other, trying to place their own people in key positions inside POMOA. Haile Fida and Sennai Likkay competed over power in POMOA. In particular, the coalition was shaken by the power struggle between Meison and Seded. POMOA had committees for ideology, organization and for running the Yekatit '66 Political School. POMOA built up organizational structures in the regions and provinces, and sometimes in the districts. The organization developed a network of some 4,000 political cadres in cells across the country.Shinn, David H., and Thomas P. Ofcansky. Historical Dictionary of Ethiopia.

Derg taking control of POMOA In December 1976 the Derg issued proclamation 108/1976. The proclamation dissolved the Supreme Organizing Committee and brought POMOA under direct supervision of the Derg Standing Committee.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988. p. 57 In essence, the July proclamation served as a final warning to Meison.

POMOA continued to exist after the departure of Meison, but was now under military control. A Seded cadre, Lt. Desta Tadesse, became the new general secretary of POMOA. Militaries began occupying key positions in several regional units of POMOA. Seded cadres also took over the Yekatit '66 Political School. One after one, POMOA member organization were purged. Later period POMOA was dissolved in December 1979 as the Commission for Organizing the Party of the Working People of Ethiopia (COPWE) was formed.Clapham Christopher.

He was also known for his work at Her Britannic Majesty's embassy in Tehran, his service in the British army in British India starting in 1914, and his active role in quarantine facilitation during infectious disease outbreaks in south-west Iran. Elgood took great interest in Persian medicine, and its history and produced several publications on the topic. He also practiced medicine in Persia, as well as back home in Britain where he was a general practitioner in Wareham, Dorset as well as a consultant to two major English hospitals. Elgood was also a cosmopolitan man travelling to most of the Persian Gulf states adding such countries as Sudan, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia to the list of places he had visited where he had transiently practiced medicine and lecturing. Historical work Elgood's major achievement was that he managed to combine the commonly delved into history of Post-Islamic Persia as cited through works of such Arabophone Persians such as Ali Abbas Majusi, Razi, and Avicenna, with the less commonly studied history of medicine in Pre-Islamic Persia. In what are perhaps his best recognized works, titled Medical History of Persia and the Eastern Caliphate from the Earliest Times Until 1932, and his Persian Medicine published in Clio Medica series, Elgood traces early concepts of Zoroastrian hygiene, Sassanid influences in Medicine, all the way to Post-Islamic writings of Avicenna, and his contemporaries. Elgood also outlines the debt that Western medicine owes to the Persian physicians and their contributions. Elgood also focuses on development of Medicine in Safavid Iran, a period stretching roughly from King Ismail I of Persia to the dynasty's fall during King Abbas III's reign. Elgood also delves into India and its medical advances. In the same period of time while Persia is ruled by the Safavids, India is dealing with the Moguls under Zahir al-Din (Ismail's counterpart) all the way to the Moghul Muhammad Shah (Abbas's counterpart). Elgood makes extensive mention of inter-civilization exchange of ideas and staff between Iran and India during this period, one such mention which deals with the Persian physician Abdul-Qadir Gilani and the invention of the so-called hubble-bubble or hookah. Elgood's areas of interest were majorly surgical, gynecological, and general medicine related. In his Safavid surgery he makes a detailed description of the medical procedures used in Safavid Persia with attention to minor details and his emphasis on anatomy and the steps involved in each procedure, perhaps owing to his medical background as well as his historical interests. Elgood's descriptions of the obstetric, ophthalmological, anaesthetic procedures give insight into great advances made in medicine under Islam in Persia despite the falsely adapted four humor theory of the Greco-Romans and the prohibition of dissections by the Islamic law. Elgood is also known, although less so, (due to his diminished dwelling on the topic) on the topic of Medical Universities in Iran namely the Academy of Gondishapur where he delineates how certain elements of Greek and the Persian medicine were adapted using the then global Arabic text to educate physicians and health care workers in the city of Gondishapur in today's province of Ahvaz. Gynecology Elgood also had an interest in gynecology in ancient Iran. In his Safavid Medical Practice he delves into midwifery, birth, sterility, pregnancy, abortion, birth control and mother child relations. In the same book he also talks about the use of sedatives, benzodiazepines-like substances, and opium in treatment of common medical ailments in Iran. In this book Elgood also sheds light on some of the treatment for common ailments of the day in Persia such as Whooping cough (Pertussis), and hay fever, as well as the methods used to deal with the newly arriving syphilis (originally contracted from the New World by French explorers and then brought to Persia). The arrival of syphilis via Europe earned the ailment the nickname of the French Pox possibly due to its secondary syphilitic presentation with gray, circular marks all over the body mimicking small pox; Persia, according to Elgood, was at the peak of its performance medically despite having to deal with newly arriving ailments and evolving existing ones. Translations Elgood also produced various translations including Prophetic medicine including his various books on ancient Iranian medicine. This was another dimension to his writing that also incorporated when apt, folk lore, anecdotes and customs. Elgood was also well respected within the historical and medical community as is indicated by this ending quote from Sami K. Hamarneh, P.H.D. who states: :The late Dr. Cyril Elgood left a legacy of writings on the history of medicine in Muslim lands, especially in Persia (Iran)...The recent death of Cyril Elgood was indeed a loss to the many who admired his thorough and intelligent evaluation of Persian medicine, its history and contributions to medical progress.

Dessauer, also known as Hans Dessauer, (13 May 1905 ‚Äì 12 August 1993) was a German-American chemical engineer and an innovator in developing xerography. He was instrumental in turning a $7 million company of the 1930s into Xerox, a billion-dollar copier company. Early years He was born Hans Dessauer in Aschaffenburg in a family of industrialists who owned the Aschaffenburger Buntpapierfabrik, a leading coloured paper factory with a long tradition. His parents were Hans Dessauer and his wife Bertha (n√©e Thywissen). The physicist Friedrich Dessauer was an uncle. He had one older half-sister, four brothers and one sister. The physicist Guido Dessauer was his younger brother. Dessauer attended the Gymnasium in Aschaffenburg, before studying chemistry in Freiburg where he joined the , in the Cartellverband. In 1926, he received a B.S. degree from the Technical University Munich. At the RWTH Aachen University, he earned an M.S. degree in 1927 and his doctorate in 1929 with a thesis on the chemical process industry (Neue Ringisomerisationen in der Camphenreihe). Career He left Germany in 1929 and went to the US, initially working at Ansco for six years in Binghamton, New York. He went to work for the Rectigraph Company in Rochester, New York in 1935, which was bought by the Haloid Company. At Haloid, he became director of research in 1938, and was instrumental in turning it from a $7 million company into a billion-dollar copier company, which became the Xerox Corporation. It was Dessauer who spotted an article about electrostatic photography, later known as xerography in Monthly Abstract Bulletin in April 1945 and recognized its potential for copying. Together with Chester Carlson who discovered the process and businessman Joseph C. Wilson, they developed its use for reproducing documents and letters. The copier was first sold in 1959. During his career at Xerox, Dessauer served as director of research, executive vice president (1959-1968), and vice chairman of the board of directors (1966-1970). He was also a member of the New York State Advisory Council for the Advancement of Industrial Research, an honorary member of the Society for Imaging Science and Technology, as well as a member and councillor of the National Academy of Engineering. He served as a director of both the Catholic Family Center in Rochester and the Rochester Regional Research Library Council. He was a trustee of the St. John Fisher College and the Rochester Museum and Science Center. He was a fellow of the American Institute of Chemists, New York State Academy of Sciences, and the Photographic Society of America. He served on the advisory committee of the University of Rochester, of Harvard College, and of the board of overseers of M.I.T., among others. Dessauer held honorary degrees from Clarkson University, Fordham University, and Le Moyne College. He was a 1968 medalist with the Industrial Research Institute, and the 1973 Frederik Philips Award recipient from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. Personal life He married Margaret ( Lee), and they had three children, sons, John and Thomas, and a daughter, Margot. In his later years, Dessauer opened the office of \\"J. M. D. Associates\\" in Pittsford, New York, devoted to \\"...education and religious and charitable works\\". Dessauer established the Judge David F. Lee and St. Francis Xavier Scholarship at the Fordham University School of Law in honor of his father-in-law, a New York Supreme Court Judge. Dessauer died in Pittsford at the age of 88.

Although Truro had been a Unionist seat Morgan, as a Baptist preacher, was able to attract the Methodist vote by preaching in the constituency's principal chapels.

In a career that lasted from June 1829 to July 1830 he ran six times and won three races, although two of his wins were walkovers. By far his most important win came on his first appearance as a three-year-old when he won the Derby as a 30/1 outsider. Dangerous was retired to stud at the end of his three-year-old season and was shortly afterwards exported to France. Background Dangerous was a \\"rich chestnut\\" horse with a small white star standing 15.3 hands high, bred by his owner, Isaac Sadler (1784‚Äì1860), a livery stable owner who bred horses at Northleach in Gloucestershire. Sadler trained the colt himself at Stockbridge in Hampshire. He had previously trained his horses at Aldworth but relocated in 1832 to take advantage of the superior gallops at the Hampshire venue. Dangerous was sired by Tramp, who won several important races in 1813 and 1814 and went on to become a very successful stallion, siring important winners including St. Giles (Epsom Derby) and Barefoot (St Leger). Dangerous was one of several good foals produced by the mare Defiance, including Delight, Defence, Design and others, all beginning with the letter \\"D\\". Racing career 1832: two-year-old season Dangerous made his first racecourse appearance at Ascot in June. He started at odds of 5/2 and finished second of the three runners in a Sweepstakes to a filly named Minima. At Stockbridge Racecourse later that month he started odds-on favourite for Sweepstakes but was easily beaten by Glaucus, who went on to be one of the season's leading colts. On his final start of the season he was unplaced behind Trepidation in a half-mile race at Warwick on 5 September. 1833: three-year-old season Dangerous was not mentioned among the Derby contenders in the early part of the year and his participation in the race was only announced a day or two before the event, making him very much a \\"dark horse\\". At Epsom on 23 May, Dangerous was offered at odds of 25/1 and 30/1 for the Derby in a field of twenty-five runners, with Glaucus starting the 3/1 favourite. According to the Court Journal the crowds were the largest in memory, with hundreds of carriages, thousands of mounted spectators and an \\"innumerable phalanx\\" of pedestrians. The start of the race was delayed by \\"shameful confusion\\" as mounted officials struggled to clear the course of spectators and their carriages. Ridden by Jem Chapple, Dangerous was restrained at the back of the field in the early stages as Catalan, another of the outsiders set a very strong pace from Forester. Many of the runners were soon struggling, but Chapple was able to bring Dangerous through the field to join the leading group as the horses approached the turn into the straight. Two furlongs from the finish, Dangerous moved past Catalan closely followed by Connoisseur who was his only serious challenger. Dangerous appeared to be \\"full of running\\" and pulled ahead to win \\"with scarcely any trouble\\", by a length from Connoisseur, with Revenge finishing strongly to take third. Apart from the first six horses, most of the other runners were either tailed-off or pulled-up before the finish. A correspondent for the Sportsman's Cabinet took this as evidence that many of the jockeys had ridden with no intention of winning. The same writer, however, claimed that the race was run at a slow pace, whereas most other sources report that the opposite was true, with the American Turf Register and Sporting Magazine describing the race as \\"the fastest Derby on record\\". In addition to the prize money of ¬£3,725, Sadler was reported to have won \\"a large sum in bets\\". Later that season Dangerous claimed two more prizes without having to run in a competitive race. No other horses opposed him and he was allowed to walk over in a Sweepstakes at Stockbridge on 27 July and a similar race at Winchester. The colt had actually sustained an injury after the Derby and would have been unable to take part in a serious race, but his trainer managed to keep his condition secret, enabling to collect both races without being tested. His injury problems made it impossible to keep Dangerous in training and he was retired at the end of the season. Assessment Some commentators acknowledged that Dangerous was the best horse on the day at Epsom and might have gone to greater success if he had stayed sound. He was described elsewhere as \\"one of the worst Derby winners\\" and it was rumoured that many of the more fancied horses had been \\"made safe\\"‚Äì prevented from winning by either bribery, drugs or deliberate injury. Stud career Dangerous began his stud career in England in 1834. A year later he was sold to representatives of the French government and exported to France, but made no mark as a sire. He was sold in 1846 and disappears from the French breeding records.

All 6 turbines are expected to be commissionned between May 2019 ang August 2020. The pumped-storage power plant will operate by using two reservoirs to generate power, an upper and a lower. During periods of high energy demand, water is released from the upper reservoir and sent to the power station to generate electricity. After power generation, the water is discharged into the lower reservoir. When energy demand is low, such as at night, water is pumped back up to the upper reservoir as stored energy. The process repeats as needed and the pump-generators serve the dual-role of both pumping and generating electricity.

Life Withenoc was the son of Caradoc de La Boussac, a nobleman with estates near Dol in Brittany. He first appears in the records as an adult in 1055. H. Guillotel (1976), in Droit priv√© et Institutions r√©gionales : √©tudes historiques offertes √† Jean Yver, Publication Univ. Rouen Havre, p.362 He married a daughter of the Archbishop of Dol, and had a younger brother, Baderon, and a son, Ratier (or Raterius), who both became monks. Following the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, William fitzOsbern was appointed Earl of Hereford, and established the first castle at Monmouth, overlooking the rivers Wye and Monnow at the southernmost tip of the area then known as Archenfield in the Welsh Marches. William fitzOsbern was killed in battle in 1071, and his son Roger was disgraced in 1075. King William then gave the lordship of Monmouth to Withenoc. It has been suggested that Bretons who supported the Normans in their conquest were given responsibility for areas in the borders of Wales because, at that time, the two Brythonic languages of Breton and Welsh were sufficiently mutually comprehensible to allow communication with the Welsh people to take place. Michael A. Faletra, Introduction, in The history of the kings of Britain by Geoffrey of Monmouth, Broadview Press, 2008, , p.10 One of Withenoc's first acts at Monmouth was to found a Benedictine priory in the town. In so doing, he called upon William of Dol - perhaps a relative - who had been appointed in 1070 as abbot of Saint Florent at Saumur. This was a great abbey on the banks of the Loire, which was destroyed in the sixteenth century. William sent a prior and monks to inaugurate the new priory at Monmouth, and, in turn, the priory and its endowments were granted to the abbey of Saint Florent. This arrangement continued until the fourteenth century, with the priors of Monmouth coming from Saumur, and part of its revenue, as an alien priory, being sent back to France. The founding charter of the priory has been transliterated as follows: Charles Heath, Historical and descriptive accounts of the ancient and present state of the town of Monmouth...., 1804 > \\"Wihenoc de Monmouth, to all men, his friends and neighbours, to all the > faithful sons of the holy mother church, as well present as future, wishes > health. Be it known unto you that I, Wihenoc, being moved by divine impulse, > the advice of God, and my soldiers and vassals requiring that from me, for > the honour of God, and the holy Virgin at St. Florentius, for the health of > my soul, and my parents, have built a church in my castle of Monmouth, and > have granted it for ever to St. Florentius de Salmure, from whence I have > invited monks to inhabit the said church; and that there they may live, > regularly serving God, I have granted unto them certain possessions, as well > in lands as in churches and tenths, viz. the church of St. Cadoc near my > castle, in my manor, where first the aforesaid monks, before the church of > Monmouth was finished, some time inhabited: the church of St. Wingatoll; the > church of Bockeville, the church of Llangradoc, the church of Welch Bicknor, > the church of Eililde Hopa (Long Hope), with the chapel of Hently, the > church of Toberton, the church of Stretton, with the chapel of Hasperton, > and three carucates of land near the castle of Monmouth, and one carucate in > Llancadock, and one carucate in Suentona, and two parts of all the tythes of > my manor, as well as in my own possessions, as in the possession of my > vassals, and the tenths of all mills, and the tenths of all my taxes. I > confirm these donations under my present writing, to be by them to be > possessed for ever. Witness my brother Baderon, &c.;\\" After about seven years at Monmouth, Withenoc gave up his secular responsibilities in 1082 and retired, as a monk, to the abbey at Saumur. He was succeeded as lord of Monmouth by his brother's son, William fitzBaderon. Withenoc returned to visit Monmouth in 1101, when the priory which he had established was formally consecrated. It has been suggested that he may have been related to Geoffrey of Monmouth, who was born in the town in about 1100, the son of another Breton nobleman, Arthur, but there is no confirmation of this.

A lighthouse was first established on 4 June 1817 to guide ships into Cork Harbour. The original tower was deemed too small and in 1835 was replaced by the larger present tower which is 49 feet high with a diameter of 12 feet. Light The original light apparatus consisted of ten Argand oil lamps and ten catoptric reflectors. In 1876 the optic was changed to a Second Order Fresnel lens, which is still in use. The lighthouse was converted to electric in 1970. The character of the light was occulting 20s (on for 15 seconds and off for 5 seconds). This was altered on 15 August 1993 to Fl WR 3s (one white and red flash every three seconds). From April 1978 the light has also been exhibited in conditions of poor visibility while the fog signal was sounding. Roche's Point has red sectors built into the main light to mark navigational hazards approaching the harbour such as the Daunt Rock near Robert's Cove and the Cow and Calf rocks just below the lighthouse. The sectors are as follows: * Red: shore-292¬∞ * White: 292¬∞-016¬∞ (84¬∞) * Red: 016¬∞-033¬∞ (17¬∞) * White: 033¬∞-159¬∞ (126¬∞) * Red: 159¬∞-shore The part of the light that is seen from land is unintensified so as not to disturb those on shore. The light at full intensity (facing sea) has a range of 20 nautical miles for the white light (37.04 km) and 17 nautical miles for the red sector (31.5 km). The light is 30 meters above high water and continues to be exhibited by day in periods of poor visibility and at night. The lighthouse, compound walls and adjacent buildings are painted white for daytime conspicuousness. The Roche's Point lighthouse was automated in 1995. Apart from the engine house and adjacent building, all the other buildings were sold at public auction. On 26 July 2017 Irish Lights issued a Notice to Mariners that on 18 October the current electric bulb within the Fresnel Lens would be changed to a LED bulb created by the General Lighthouse Authorities. Due to storms Opheilia, Brian and Caroline in Ireland, this had been postponed. On Monday 26 February 2018 the new LED bulb developed by R&RNAV; was installed at Roche's Point. The LED bulb uses significantly less electricity for almost the same visual range and has a life of about 10 years. The new bulb was placed into the centre of the second order Fresnel lens to maintain the long range of the light. This retention of the lens contrasts with the approach at some lighthouses where traditional lenes have been removed and replaced with new LED apparatus. Fog signals A bell was established at Roche's Point in 1864 to warn mariners in poor visibility. This was replaced by a siren fog signal on 1 December 1898. The fog signal changed again in 1949 when a diaphone was installed with a character of one two-second blast every thirty seconds. In 1995 when the lighthouse was automated an electric fog signal (ELG 300-04) replaced the diaphone. This electric fog signal was connected to a fog detector which activated the fog signal if visibility fell below three nautical miles. The electric fog signal had a range of four nautical miles. On 11 January 2011 the Commissioners of Irish Lights, despite much opposition, discontinued all Irish fog signals. This brought an end to a long era of fog signaling at Roche's Point. Lighthouse Keeper William Jervis James was the lighthouse keeper from 29/10/1934 to 17/08/1936. Jim Power was the last keeper before its automation and he is now the lighthouse attendant. On 4 June 2017 (marking the 200 anniversary since the lighthouse's establishment on 4 June 1817), there was an open day at the lighthouse, with 1,500 visitors given the chance to climb the lighthouse to the balcony. Former lighthouse keepers were present for the open day.

Biography She was born in Chicago, Illinois but moved to San Francisco, California with her parents at a young age. She began acting at the age of 7, appearing on stage in many child roles and later won the Women's National Shakespeare Contest for her role as Juliet in a production of Romeo and Juliet. She also took up modeling and was named \\"Miss San Francisco\\" and \\"Miss California\\" in 1939. She was a top-five runner-up to Patricia Donnelly in the \\"Miss America 1939\\" competition. She made her feature film debut in Casanova in Burlesque (1944) and adopted her stage name, Margia Dean. Although never under contract to a studio, most of the films, some 16 in all, she made were for the producer Robert L. Lippert. Her first leading role was in Shep Come Home (1948) and roles followed in Red Desert (1949), FBI Girl (1951), The Lonesome Trail (1955), Villa!! (1958) and Seven Women from Hell (1961). Dean starred in a 1958 western, Ambush at Cimarron Pass, that featured Clint Eastwood in one of his earliest film roles. She also portrayed a trapeze artist in the 1961 circus tale The Big Show, which starred Esther Williams and Robert Vaughn. Her association with Lippert had led to her being cast in The Quatermass Xperiment (1955), the first Hammer horror film. Frustrated that her roles were predominantly in B movies, she eventually retired from acting following her marriage in 1965 to her second husband, architect Felipe Alvarez. Her final film was Moro Witch Doctor (1964). She briefly became involved in movie production, producing The Long Rope (1961) with Hugh Marlowe as well as a number of television pilots. She has since been vice-president of a real estate firm and has worked in costume design and interior decoration.

Ostick originally played for Widnes St Marie's before turning professional with Widnes. After making his way in the club's academy, Ostick d√©buted for the 'Chemics' in 2008 and made seven substitute appearances. Later in his first season Michael enjoyed a loan spell with Barrow that brought a further five games and the first two tries of his professional career (against Hunslet and London Skolars). The following season saw Ostick make 27 appearances for Widnes, including twenty starts and he was consistently one of the top performers. It was a surprise to many when a contract offer was withdrawn and he was released. Michael then agreed an offer from Rochdale Hornets. A seven game stint came to an end when Halifax enquired after his services and Ostick was on the move again. It proved controversial as Michael played in a Challenge Cup tie against Swinton in Round Four for Halifax having already represented Rochdale in Round Three. As a result Halifax were disqualified from the competition. Ostick played in the Qualifying Semi-Final at Featherstone Rovers in 2010 but missed out on selection to the Grand Final against the same team and watched on as a Bob Beswick inspired Halifax edged Rovers in extra-time. Injuries restricted his appearances for Halifax during the 2011 season, at the end of which he was released to join Leigh. Michael also works for a company called SWITCH alongside other professional rugby star Mick Nanyn operating out of the Leigh Sports Village where they help to promote motivation and a feeling of accomplishment in people who have been struggling to find work.

Early life Born in 1964, Hirose was an outstanding student in his early years. In 1983, Hirose was admitted by Waseda University and chose applied physics as his major. In 1987, Hirose graduated from Waseda University as the best student in his grade and entered the Graduate School of Waseda University with a research topic on high-temperature superconductivity. Working with his supervisor, he published a paper in July 1987. His supervisor said Hirose was a gifted scientist. At the same time, Hirose began to wonder if the knowledge he learned in the university could help the society. Joining Aum Shinrikyo and leading secret assault rifle production In 1988, Hirose read books written by Shoko Asahara by accident. He was attracted by Asahara and began to contact with Asahara. Per Asahara's request, in 1989, after graduating from graduate school and get his master's degree, Hirose declined a job offered by NEC and joined Aum Shinrikyo, becoming an important person in this group. In the early 1990s, he produced around 1,000 assault rifles based on AK-74. It's reported that Hirose once went to Russia to test assault rifles produced by him. Tokyo subway gas attack, arrest, trial and execution In 1995, Hirose took part in the Tokyo subway sarin attack. He was assigned to release the sarin in the train A777 on Marunouchi Line (). Hirose was arrested in the same year. In 2000, he was sentenced to death. In 2006, his appeal was dismissed. On July 26, 2018, Hirose was executed by hanging in the Tokyo Detention House.

Connivance to the reader should not be established ... on the basis of specialistic interest nor by formal flatteries; contents only can ground it ... The essential is that the reader should get from the description of contents a clear idea of what the book is and of the reasons of its importance, those which have induced us to prefer it to others¬ª.L'Indice dei libri del mese, n. 1, 1984, p. 3. Translation from the original Italian ¬´L'essenziale √® che il primo momento, cio√® l'esposizione del contenuto, abbia la centralit√† che gli spetta.

L'essenziale √® che attraverso l'esposizione il lettore acquisisca una chiara idea di quel che il libro √® e delle ragioni della sua importanza, ragioni che hanno fatto s√¨ che lo scegliessimo a differenza di altri¬ª In its twenty-eight years of existence, L'Indice has always remained faithful to this program.As remarked by several Italian columnists on the occasion of the successful fund-raising campaign launched by L'Indice in 2011: see articles from La Repubblica (October 6th, 2011), La Stampa (October 6th, 2011), Il Quotidiano della Calabria (September 24th, 2011), Il Giornale (July 4th, 2011). It has documented the Italian book production through reviews and notices, along with surveys, columns, interviews and articles of different sorts. Each of its editors has left his own mark on the review: Gian Giacomo Migone (1984‚Äì90) and Cesare Cases (1990‚Äì1994) have contributed to specify the original project, whose recognizable physiognomy is indissolubly associated with Tullio Pericoli's portraits and graphics, as well as with Franco Matticchio's drawings. Alberto Papuzzi (1994‚Äì1999) brought special attention to the relationship between cinema and literature/essays. Under Luca Rastello's (2000‚Äì2001) guidance, L'Indice inaugurated a new column, \\"Segnali\\" (Signals), focusing on cultural and political changes, as well as knotty issues in the society we live in. Mimmo C√†ndito (2001-) has enriched L'Indice with ‚ÄúVillaggio globale‚Äù (Global Village), hosting correspondents who write about books production in Europe and worldwide.

L'Indice channel on YouTube provides videos of such debates, as well as interviews with authors and speakers. The website of the Italian radio station Radio Radicale collects radio recordings of some of such events.  The European Dimension: \\"Liber\\"  In 1989, Gian Giacomo Migone, then editor of L'Indice, and Pierre Bourdieu launched the idea of a European literary and cultural journal to be published with identical contents in several European countries.Edwin McDowell, Literary Journal Is Planned in 4 Languages, The New York Times, June 6th, 1989; see also an article appeared on the Italian newspaper La Repubblica on May 27th, 1989. Starting from apparently national, country-specific interventions, the journal aimed at emphasizing the inherent unity of the European culture in a critical historical moment of the integration process, addressing specialists and the wider public at the same time. Along with L'Indice, The Times Literary Supplement, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Le Monde and El Pa√≠s sponsored the project. A 24-pages quarterly multinational literary journal called ‚ÄúLiber. Revue europ√©enne des livres‚Äù (‚ÄúLiber. European Review of Books‚Äù) ‚Äì deliberately playing upon the ambiguity intrinsic to the Latin root, which means both ‚Äúbook‚Äù and ‚Äúfree‚Äù ‚Äì was therefore published in the biennium 1989-90 (its first issue was presented at the Frankfurt Book Fair of October 1989), with a combined circulation of over one million.On the history and importance of Liber, see Peter Collier, ‚ÄúLiber: Liberty and Literature‚Äù, French Cultural Studies, Vol. 4 (12), 1993: 291-300. The editor was Pierre Bourdieu. Jeremy Treglown (then editor of The Times Literary Supplement), Frank Schirrmarcher (Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung) and Thomas Ferenczi (Le Monde) joined Migone and Bourdieu in the editorial board. After five editions, ‚ÄúLiber‚Äù became a supplement of Bourdieu‚Äôs publication Actes de la recherche en sciences sociales.Michael Grenfell, Pierre Bourdieu Agent Provocateur.

Life  ≈Ωu≈æemberk Castle He was a descendant of the elder line of the Auersperg family from Carniola. His parents were Dietrich II of Auersperg and Sidonia Gall von Gallenstein. Johann Weikhard held several positions at the Austrian court. From 1640, he was Obersthofmeister (Lord Chamberlain) and teacher of Ferdinand IV, who was King of the Romans at the time. In 1641 he was sent to The Hague and later he took part in peace negotiations at Osnabr√ºck, which ultimately ended the Thirty Years‚Äô War with the Peace of Westphalia (1648).Britannica, The Editors of Encyclopaedia. ‚ÄúJohann Weikhart, Prince Von Auersperg.‚Äù Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Inc., 9 Nov. 2018, www.britannica.com/biography/Johann-Weikhart- Prince-von-Auersperg. In 1653, Emperor Ferdinand III raised him to Imperial Prince and in 1654, in his capacity as King of Bohemia, enfeofed him with the Duchy of M√ºnsterberg and the City of Frankenstein. He then styled himself Duke of M√ºnsterberg.Herbert Schmidt: Der Silbererzbergbau in der Grafschaft Glatz und im F√ºrstentum M√ºnsterberg-Oels. Von den mittelalterlichen Anf√§ngen bis zum Niedergang, Tectum-Verlag, Marburg, 2003, , p. 18 He held great political influence during the first decade of the rule of Emperor Leopold I. As prime minister of Austria (1665-1669), he concluded a secret treaty with France on 19 January 1668 about the division of the Spanish monarchy and worked towards a Catholic triple alliance between Austria, France and Spain. He was, however, suspected of having had secret talks with king Louis XIV of France, who was alleged to have promised him a post as Cardinal and was suddenly relieved of his duties on 10 December 1669 and banished from the court. He was sentenced to death, however, this sentence was never effectuated. He lived the rest of his life on his estates in Carniola. In 1673, he inherited the Lordships of Gottschee and ≈Ωu≈æemberk from his elder brother Wolf Engelbrecht, Count of Auersperg.  Marriage  Johann Weikhard married Countess Marie Katharine of Losenstein (1635‚Äì1691). They had three sons and five daughters.
