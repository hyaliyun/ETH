A left-handed batsman and occasional left-arm spin bowler born in Wimbledon, Aworth played for Surrey's Second XI from 1971 before appearing for Cambridge against the MCC in 1972 and making his first-class debut for them against Warwickshire in 1973. In July 1974 he was selected for Surrey's First XI and debuted against Lancashire. He would play twenty-eight County Championship matches for Surrey, as well as eighteen one day games in the John Player League and Benson and Hedges Cup. He scored 67 in the semi-final of the 1976 Benson & Hedges Cup. For Cambridge he made thirty-one appearances in total. Across his first-class career, he scored 2,552 runs including three centuries. His professional career ended in 1976 with matches against the British Army. Playing career Aworth, who was born in Wimbledon, played for Wimbledon Cricket Club through the 1960s. He was a \\"valuable asset\\" at the club, as was his father who also played there. =Surrey Second XI= Aworth began his professional playing career with Surrey's Second XI on 4 August 1971 with his debut game against Sussex's own Second XI. Played at a cricket ground in Horsham, the match saw Sussex declare at 205/2, and though Surrey made 160 and 138, none of the batsmen's scores are recorded. He then played several matches for Surrey's U-25 team, beginning with a game against the Sussex U-25 team on 4 May 1972. Several of these games, against Essex, Middlesex and Middlesex took place in May and June that year. He also made 25 and 17 against the Kent Second XI in July, and he captained the Surrey Colts against the Scottish Cricket Union Colts in August. Several Second XI games followed against Middlesex, Hampshire and Glamorgan. =Cambridge= In 1973 Aworth's father John died. At the start of the 1973 cricket season when he had gone up to St Catharine's College, Cambridge from Tiffin School, and he was selected for the First XI cricket team to play in the University matches, beginning with Warwickshire on 21 April. Batting at three, he scored 25 and 10. He would play eleven University matches that season, scoring 379 runs at 18.95 with a best of 45. In April 1974 the season started with University matches against Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire as well as three Benson and Hedges games. The last of these was against Surrey, with Aworth scoring three. He made 97 against Warwickshire on 4 May, and 56 against both Gloucestershire on 8 May and Kent on 5 June. He also scored 77 against the touring Indian cricket team. These scores led to a call up to the First XI for Surrey in mid-July. =Surrey= Aworth's debut for Surrey on 13 July against Lancashire saw him out for 25 in his only innings as the match ended as a rain-affected draw. He made 19 and 17 in his next game against Gloucestershire, and opened the batting in a one-day game against Lancashire, scoring 27. In all first-class cricket that year, he played seventeen games, scoring 767 runs at 28.40, and he fared poorly in one day cricket with only 59 runs from six games. The following season Aworth returned to Cambridge to play University Matches through April and May. He scored 51 against Northamptonshire on 30 April, and 56 against Nottinghamshire on 14 May. He returned to Surrey for the summer, and scored 115 opening the batting against Middlesex, his maiden County Championship century. This was followed by knocks of 43 against Essex, 55 against Worcestershire, and 63 against Sussex. He was still moving around the batting order for Surrey in one day matches, sometimes opening the batting and then batting at number three or four in later games. He continued to struggle in the shorter format, playing 12 games but scoring only 172 runs at an average of 14.33. He nevertheless continued to enjoy a richer return in first-class cricket, adding two further centuries for Cambridge to his season tally. He scored over 1,000 first-class runs for the season, ending it with 1,057 runs at an average of 31.08, with seven half- centuries as well as his hundreds. He continued to find the one day game challenging in 1976, however. He would only managed 161 runs across seven matches, and he did not feature in Surrey's campaign to win the Benson and Hedges Cup until the semi-final stage. Nevertheless, he registered his career- best one day score, 67, against Kent in that semi-final. Kent were victorious, however, thanks to a century by Mike Denness. In the four-day game, he scored a half-century against a touring West Indies cricket team later that month. He passed 2,500 first-class runs against Essex on 3 July, but overall he could not recapture his form of the previous season, scoring only 349 from ten matches at 20.52. He played his final first-class game of the season on 10 July against Kent. He returned to the Second XI to face the Army in August, scoring 52.

It unites different scientific disciplines, such as physics, biology, mathematics, medical science, psychology, computer science, engineering and philosophy in the endeavor to understand how the brain functions. The close combination of neurobiological experiments with theoretical models and computer simulations allows scientists of the Bernstein Network to pursue innovative approaches with regard to one of the most complex structures nature has created in the course of evolution: the natural brain. The network started in 2004 with a funding initiative of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) to develop and interconnect research structures in computational neuroscience throughout Germany and to promote the transfer of theoretical insight into clinical and technical applications. It is named after the German physiologist and biophysicist Julius Bernstein (1839-1917). His \\"membrane hypothesis\\" provided the first biophysical explanation of how nerve cells transmit and process information via electrical currents. Generating a mathematical description, he also paved the way to simulate neural brain processes in the computer. Today, the Bernstein Network consists of more than 200 research groups worldwide.  History  In 2004, the Bernstein Network started off as the \\"Nationales Bernstein Netzwerk Computational Neuroscience\\" (NNCN)) as a funding initiative of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). The aim of the initiative was the long-term establishment of the research discipline Computational Neuroscience in Germany.Overview of the Bernstein Network by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research As part of the high-tech strategy of the German government, the Bernstein Network has been supported with a total of about 170 million euros until now. The network includes over 200 research groups at more than 25 locations nationwide. The participating research groups were located at universities and non-university research institutes (Fraunhofer, Helmholtz, Leibniz and Max Planck institutes). Using a BMBF initial financing, 22 new professorships in the area of Computational Neuroscience were established at German universities within the framework of the Bernstein Network, which were cnsoblidated by the federal states.Overview of the structure on the website of the Bernstein NetworkVideo about the Bernstein Network on the German neuroscience information portal www.dasGehirn.info (in German) Scientific members of the network were involved in study programs and courses and collaborated with numerous industry partners to develop specific biomedical or technological applications (e.g. brain computer interface, retinal implant, cochlear implant, prosthesis, advanced driver-assistance systems, neuromorphic chips). They also worked (and still do) on new diagnostic methods, therapeutic approaches, or tools for neurological or psychiatric disorders in collaboration with clinical researchers (e.g. epilepsy, tinnitus, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke, depression, schizophrenia).  Structure  Six Bernstein Centers (in Berlin, Freiburg, G√∂ttingen, Heidelberg-Mannheim, Munich and T√ºbingen) form the basic structure of the Bernstein Network.Information on the Bernstein Centers on the website of the Bernstein Network As additional local structural elements, five Bernstein groups have been established (in Bochum, Bremen, Heidelberg, Jena, and Magdeburg).Information on the Bernstein groups on the website of the Bernstein Network Eleven Bernstein Collaborations link the Bernstein Centers with diverse research groups widely distributed over Germany.Information about Bernstein Collaborations on the website of the Bernstein Network Since 2006, the BMBF has annually allocated the Bernstein Award to an outstanding young scientist in the research field of Computational Neuroscience.Overview of the Bernstein Award on the website of Bernstein network The award is endowed with up to 1,25 million euros over five years, and allows to establish an independent junior research group at a German research institution. Since 2008 and 2009, respectively, the Bernstein Network comprehends two research foci, which explore the first steps towards applications. The Bernstein Focus: Neurotechnology includes 4 local collaborative projects (in Berlin, G√∂ttingen, Frankfurt and Freiburg-T√ºbingen);Information on the Bernstein Focus Neurotechnology on the website of the Bernstein Network the Bernstein Focus: Neuronal Basis of Learning comprises eight collaborative projects.Information on the Bernstein Focus Learning on the website of the Bernstein Network  Integration into the international research landscape  The German INCF Node (G-Node) connects the Bernstein Network with the international network of the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility.

It is a single-story masonry structure, built out of red brick, with a gabled slate roof and granite trim. Stylistically it has a mix of Late Victorian elements, with Gothic-arched windows and roof gables with Stick style woodwork. The interior retains most of its original finishes on the main floor; the basement was modernized as an expansion in 1970s, and a major addition repeated the original's details in 2012-13. The town's first library was founded in 1823, and was a private library open by subscription. The town made a short-lived attempt to establish a public library in 1868, which was abandoned in 1872 with the books auctioned off. In 1883, Judge Josiah Minot and Colonel Solomon Sleeper, both natives of Bristol, offered the town the land and funding for a building, as well as further support for the acquisition of a collection. This offer was accepted by the town, and this building was completed in 1885, designed and built by a local contractor, Ebenezer Hutchinson.

It tells the story of a Bantam soldier who serves in the regular Army in World War I, finds another way to serve. Synopsis The protagonist Billy \\"Stick\\" Stirling comes from a middle-class family which falls on hard times when their day-dreaming father abandons them. He grows up in Glasgow with his mother and ends up in trouble for a minor burglary. His experience toughens him and he employs his intelligence to rise above his diminutive stature to become a ruthless operator in the snooker halls of Glasgow. A lethal confrontation leaves Billy with a family blood vengeance. In a Glasgow caf√©, he meets a bearded, older stranger who is acquainted with his mother. The stranger advises him to join the Army Bantam Regiment (which accepted soldiers of small stature) to escape his troubles. Billy has little choice and enlists. During his training in England, he meets his true love and has to leave her behind. She is already married to an active-duty soldier and becomes pregnant. He is posted to the front line and applies his survival skills to good effect. He survives with bravery until his blood vengeance catches up with him in the trenches. He survives, but is seriously injured. He is invalided out of the Army and returns to Glasgow to overcome his injury and rebuild his life. The love he left finds him in Glasgow and surprises him. Billy settles down with a happy wife and family as a respected Scottish businessman. Conception 2014 was the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of World War I. The author's inspiration came from his interest and knowledge of military history. The Bantam regiments are largely an untold story of men who were smaller than the Army regulation height and rejected to fight in World War I. The author decided to use a fictional narrative to explore details of the bantam soldiers, who are often missed in historical documents that refer to the bantam regiments. Many beings of diminutive size were involved in brawls - especially in bars usually initiated by taunts of their height and stature. The author uses original songs from the Bantam soldiers to paint a historically accurate life of being a small soldier in the trenches. The 'Wee Fellas' is a Scottish dialect phrase meaning the small men. The Bantam regiments originated in Cheshire. Scottish dialect is used throughout the text reflecting the language of Glasgow. Publication The novel is published in paperback and Kindle format. Reception The Scottish press carried articles in 2014 Song lyrics A bantam soldiers song used in the book. \\"When the bantam roosters crow, You'll find the enemy lying low, Though we're not much in height, Boy, how can we fight Just count on the chickens to give them a licking....

James Andrew McCauley (1822-1896) was a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church and served as President of Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania from 1872 to 1888. Early life Rev. James Andrew McCauley, c.1865 James Andrew McCauley was born on October 7, 1822, in Cecil County, Maryland, to Daniel and Elizabeth McCauley. His early education was lacking, but he acquired the English rudiments and had a great fondness for books. His family removed to Baltimore, and at the age of 17, he worked in a mercantile house. After two years, he took a preparatory course at the classical academy of the scholar Rev. John H. Dashiell in Baltimore, Maryland, before entering Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, as a freshman in September 1844. He was elected to the Union Philosophical Society and he graduated from Dickinson College with highest honors in 1847. For the next two years he was a private tutor for one of the oldest families in Maryland. During college, McCauley decided the Christian ministry was his destiny vocation, and in 1850 he was admitted to the ministry of the Methodist Episcopal Church at the session of the Baltimore Conference. At the session, that body decided to establish a secondary school of high grade for women, and McCauley was assigned the responsibility of inaugurating and conducting the enterprise. Shortly following this, he married Rachel Moore Lightner on July 8, 1851, with whom he had a daughter, Fanny. The secondary school for women was a notable success, but at the end of four years McCauley relinquished the trust on account of impaired health. After brief rest he entered the pastorate, and for eighteen years had some of the most important charges in the city of Baltimore and Washington. In 1867, McCauley was awarded a Doctor of Divinity degree (D.D.) from his alma mater Dickinson College, where he served as a Trustee from 1869 to 1872. McCauley was residing in Washington and presiding elder of the district, when called to the presidency of Dickinson College in 1872.James Terry White, \\"The National Cyclopedia of American Biography\\", Volume VI, (1896), 430-431. Dickinson College Dr. James Andrew McCauley served as President of Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, from 1872 to 1888. In 1872, Dr. McCauley accepted the position as the fourteenth President of Dickinson College, remaining as such for the next sixteen years, until 1888. At the time McCauley assumed the role of President, Dickinson had declined during the Civil War and patronage and income had waned. Buildings were unsightly from want of repair, and the feeling of distress was causing many to despond with regard to the future. But McCauley faced the difficulties with determination and during his tenure increased endowments, built new facilities, enhanced curricula and enlarged faculty. In September 1872, McCauley authorized the founding of the Dickinsonian, the College newspaper still in production. McCauley undertook an expansion of the campus that was unprecedented in the life of the institution in curricula, faculty and facilities. McCauley is also credited with admitting Zatae Leola (Longsdorff) Straw, the first female graduate of Dickinson College.Zatae Leola (Longsdorff) Straw, M.D. was a strong, outspoken woman who experienced many \\"firsts\\" in her life. She was a trend-setter and role-model for other women of her age. The daughter of a physician, she was born in 1866 in Pennsylvania, and died in 1955 in Manchester, New Hampshire. She was the first female graduate of Dickinson College in 1887. While at Dickinson, she was the first woman to win the Pierson Oratorial prize. http://www.cowhampshireblog.com/2008/03/19/manchester-new-hampshire-physician- civil-leader-and-politician-zatae-l-longsdorff-straw-1866-1955/ Carlisle Indian School In 1879, Dr. McCauley began an association between Dickinson College and the Carlisle Indian School that lasted almost forty years. In 1879, Dr. McCauley began an association between Dickinson College and the Carlisle Indian School that continued almost forty years. The Indian School was less than two miles from the campus of Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. The long association began upon the opening of the Indian School at Carlisle Barracks when Dr. McCauley led the first worship service. It was Mrs. Pratt, wife of Superintendent Captain Richard Henry Pratt, who had initiated the contact between the Indian School and Dickinson. Upon Pratt's absence one Sunday, Mrs. Pratt wrote to President McCauley and requested his aid as a minister which he graciously accepted. The relationship did not stop there, with Captain Pratt noting that \\"from that time forward Dr. McCauley became an advisor and most valued friend to the school\\" and \\"we had the advantage of contacting and contending with our distinguished neighbor, Dickinson College, with its more than a century of success in developing strong and eminent men to fill the highest places in our national life.\\" Richard Henry Pratt, \\"Battlefield and Classroom: Four Decades with the American Indian, 1867-1904\\", ed. Robert M. Utley (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1964), 241, 316. Thereafter, Dr. McCauley helped Pratt to develop a Board of Trustees and a Board of Visitors composed of different heads of leading national educational institutions and wealthy donors. The Indian school was only partly supported by government funds and was heavily dependent upon private philanthropy. Dickinson College professors served as chaplains and special faculty to the Indian School. Professor Charles Francis Himes, Dr. George Edward Reed, Stephen Baird and Joshua Lippincott fostered the relationship between the institutions through religious services, advisory meetings, lectures and commencement speeches.http://wiki.dickinson.edu/index.php?title=Influence_from_the_Faculty_at_Dickinson&action;=edit The presence of Native Americans on campus generated great enthusiasm among Dickinson students, and they volunteered services, observed teaching methods and participated in events. The October 24, 1896 Dickinsonian \\"On the Campus\\" section tells of the new volunteer Sunday School teachers from the Dickinson chapter of the YMCA. It further declares that those who work with Indian boys \\"enjoy a rare privilege.\\" In addition, at the time of annual Indian School commencement, it was traditional for a half day holiday to be given so Dickinson students could attend the \\"very interesting exercises.\\" Dickinson College also provided Carlisle Indian School students with access to the Dickinson Preparatory School (\\"Conway Hall\\") and college level education.http://wiki.dickinson.edu/index.php/History_of_Conway_Hall Later years In 1883, Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania, awarded him a Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) In 1888, at the age of 66, McCauley resigned as President of Dickinson College and returned to the pastorate. He later combined his preaching with a professorship of theology and Hebrew at Morgan College, now Morgan State University, in Baltimore, Maryland. Reverend James Andrew McCauley died on December 12, 1896, in Baltimore, Maryland, at the age of 77. McCauley Memorial Room On June 6, 1925, the McCauley Memorial Room in Old West at Dickinson College was dedicated in his memory, the gift of one of his students, Lemuel T. Appold, class of 1882. The room was intended to serve the students as a recreation and study room, but also became the site for several decades of meetings of the faculty with the president of the College.http://archives.dickinson.edu/people/james-andrew-mccauley-1822-1896.

Life  Gregory was born in the late 8th century at Irenopolis in the Isaurian Dekapolis, whence his sobriquet. Francis Dvornik placed his birth between 780 and 790, while Cyril Mango regarded the year 797 as a terminus ante quem for his birth. His parents were Sergios and Maria, and he had at least one brother, whose name is not known. A later relative of the family was the early 10th-century Patriarch of Constantinople, Euthymius. According to his hagiography, he began his elementary schooling at age eight, but fled his home to the mountains when his parents wanted to marry him (ca. 815/6). There he encountered the former bishop of Irenopolis, who had been forced to abandon his see due to his opposition to the renewed adoption of Iconoclasm. After receiving his blessing, and on the advice of his mother, he entered the monastery where his brother was already a monk. Soon, however, he fell out with his pro-iconoclast abbot, and abandoned the monastery for that of his maternal uncle, Symeon. He remained at his uncle's monastery for 14 years, after which he asked permission to retire to a cave as a hermit (ca. 830). There he reportedly experienced a vision of the divine light, as well as an appearance by a woman who miraculously cured him of sexual desire by means of some sort of operation, a possible allusion to Gregory being a eunuch. In ca. 832/3, after receiving a \\"divine command\\", he began his wanderings across the Byzantine world. He went first to Ephesus, whence he took ship for Prokonnesos, Ainos and Christoupolis. From there he journeyed overland to Thessalonica and Corinth. From Corinth he took again ship to Rome via Rhegion and Naples. Gregory remained in a cell in Rome for three months, before continuing his journey to Syracuse in Sicily, where he again spent time in isolated contemplation in a tower in the harbour. From Sicily he returned to Thessalonica via Otranto, where he was mistaken for an Arab spy and mistreated (ca. 834). At Thessalonica he taught several pupils, including Joseph the Hymnographer. A few years later, possibly ca. 836/7, he went on‚Äîaccompanied by Joseph, according to the latter's hagiography‚Äîto Constantinople, where he stayed at the Antypas Church or the Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus, and visited the monastic community of Mount Olympus in Bithynia. His last years were marked by illness, first epilepsy and then from hydropsy. He died on a 20 November in the year 842 or, according to different interpretations, 841 or perhaps earlier still. In ca. 850, his remains were transferred to a monastery founded by Joseph the Hymnographer near the grave of John Chrysostomos in the Church of the Holy Apostles.  Hagiography and veneration  The hagiography describing his life is attributed to the contemporary monk and writer Ignatios the Deacon, but the authorship is disputed. Although he lived through the second period of the Byzantine Iconoclasm, and is recorded as an advocate of the iconophile view, Gregory was not persecuted. As a saint, he was chiefly remembered as a miracle-worker, whence his surname ŒΩŒ≠ŒøœÇ Œ∏Œ±œÖŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÖœÅŒ≥œåœÇ, \\"the New Miracle-Worker\\". The only extant writing of Gregory himself is a sermon regarding the‚Äîlikely historical‚Äîconversion of a Muslim to Christianity. As a historical work, his hagiography is a poor source about contemporary events, but \\"provides much evidence on administrative and legal practice\\" in contemporary Byzantium. Images of Gregory are rare, and he is depicted \\"as a monk with a trim round white beard\\". His feast day in the Eastern Orthodox Church is on November 20.

Since 2013 he has been a Research Professor of Transcultural Medieval History at the Institut d‚ÄôEstudis Medievals (IEM) of the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB). In the academic year 2014/2015 he was Visiting Professor at the √âcole Pratique des Hautes √âtudes, Paris. In the academic year 2015/2016 he was Visiting Fellow at the Medieval Institute of the University of Notre Dame, Indiana. In 2016, he accepted the prestigious position of a Senior Research Professor of ICREA (Instituci√≥ Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avan√ßats, English: Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies), Barcelona.

Since Summer 2020 he has been an elected member of the Academia Europaea.  PhD and thesis of habilitation  Tischler wrote his PhD on the production, transmission, reception and edition of Einhart's Vita Karoli in the Middle Ages and Modern Times. His habilitation thesis deals with the biblical legacy of the Augustinian abbey of St. Victor in Paris, a centre of scholastic learning with Europe-wide influence from the 12th to the 15th centuries.  Research fields and publications  Tischler has published in various languages (Catalan, English, French, German, Italian and Spanish) on the dissemination and use of Ostrogothic, Visigothic and Carolingian biographical, historiographical, juridical and philosophical texts and their effects on religious, social and political identity building, on the role of the Jews‚Äô, Christians‚Äô and Muslims‚Äô sacred and polemical texts from comparative intra- and transcultural standpoints and on central aspects of the intellectual history of individual scholars and religious orders in the Early, High and Late Middle Ages. He is a specialist of worldwide renown on the tradition of Carolingian culture in the Middle Ages. His more recent research interests are focused on the role of Carolingian culture in processes of identity building in the peripheries of post-Carolingian Europe (e.g. in Septimania and Catalonia), on the interrelationship between the medieval edition of biblical manuscripts and historiographical writing in transcultural societies, and on the transfer and transformation of scholasticism in European centres and peripheries of learning (e.g. in Franconia, Saxonia, Catalonia and Arag√≥n). Tischler's scholarly agenda revolves around developing codicological, palaeographical and philological studies within transcultural history, following methodologically his academic grandfather Bernhard Bischoff and his academic father , the establishment of codicologically and philologically grounded Transcultural Medieval Studies on the Iberian Peninsula, the Mediterranean World and beyond, and the development of a new master narrative that accommodates medieval collective religious memories conflicting with each other on the basis of Jan Assmann's and Aleida Assmann's concept of cultural memory and Johannes Fried's model of \\"historische Memorik\\", in order to historically anchoring Europe's current religious and cultural plurality in a global world order.  Projects  Tischler is just finishing a comprehensive monograph on the more or less unknown transfer of early scholastic learning from Northern France to the North-Eastern peripheries of the Holy Roman Empire in the 12th and 13th centuries. In addition, he is writing the first part of a trilogy of the history of Christian-Muslim encounters and entanglements in the medieval Iberian Peninsula between the 8th and 15th centuries. In March 2014, he has been installed as the official editor of the new critical edition of Einhart's Vita Karoli, which will be published by the Monumenta Germaniae Historica in Munich.

She was the founder of several orphanages and charity schools and a great advocate for empowering girls particularly from disadvantaged and refugee backgrounds. She also founded the Young Women's Muslim Association, dedicated to the same purpose and was a tireless worker for the support of Palestinian political prisoners. Throughout her life she was a great believer that in the highly fragmented Palestinian political scene there was no limit to what could be achieved if one allowed others to take the credit. Born in Wadi Hunein and raised in what was reportedly the largest country house in Palestine, Nuzha was introduced to politics early when her father, Yaqub al-Ghusayn, the first Palestinian leader to be exiled by the British in 1936. She subsequently saw her country house fire bombed by Jewish terrorist organisations during the troubles. She married Anwar Bey Nusseibeh in 1942 who was also involved in politics with her father. She was possessed with a high degree of personal physical courage. When her husband's second amputation (the result of a wound sustained in the 1948 war) failed and she was told of a British miracle drug available on the black market called penicillin, she drove with her husband's law clerk from Beirut to Jerusalem (147 miles) under heavy shelling in the final stages of the 1948 war, gathered some Persian carpets and silverware from her home (seeing it for the last time) and drove back to Beirut, sold her possessions and bought the penicillin that saved her husband. This same personal courage was demonstrated when she organised one of the first nationalist Palestinian demonstrations against King Hussain's administration after Sharon's raid on Samou village in 1966. In the meantime, along with Hind Husseini and Amal Sahhar she helped establish several orphanages and charity schools for refugee girls as well as campaigning for women's rights and creating women's institutes. After the fall of Jerusalem in 1967 she organised the first civilian protest against Israeli occupation, made up entirely of women, which was then followed by several protest sit-ins and hunger strikes that attracted media attention to the Palestinian plight. She also organised the erection of monuments to mark the graves of fallen Arab soldiers in that conflict, against direct military orders to the contrary. These grave markers were subsequently removed by the Israeli military and she increasingly became the target of the attention of the Israeli security who often picked her up for questioning in the early hours of the morning. Nonetheless, she worked tirelessly to support Palestinian political prisoners, organising the delivery of food an clothing parcels to them and helping rehabilitate them once released from Israeli military prisons. By the mid 1970s she had moved on to rehabilitating Palestinian common criminals by channelling their energies towards political activism, thus launching the first Palestinian acting troupe that staged the first Palestinian political play in the YMCA theatre in Jerusalem in the midst of the 1976 troubles to much Palestinian acclaim, but which was shut down by the Israeli censors after one night. With advancing age she dedicated herself increasingly to her women's organisations and charities, notably the YWMA which she established in 1975. A lifelong left-leaning populist she combined charity work with economic empowerment as a means of political liberation for the poor, particularly women. Despite the fact that her marriage was an arranged one and that she occupied the opposite political spectrum to her husband, they formed an effective political couple in occupied Jerusalem. She is survived by her children: Munira; Saida; Zaki; Sari; Hatem and Saker. Her funeral on 22 December 2013 in the Noble Sanctuary in Jerusalem was reported to be the largest funeral Jerusalem had seen since that of her husband who died in 1986. She was made a Knight of Jerusalem in 2010 in recognition of her lifelong dedication to Jerusalem.

The dynastic political clans of Haryana are often criticised for the infamous self-serving politics of the Aaya Ram Gaya Ram turncoats who notoriously engage in the frequent party switching, political horse trading, unholy political alliances, political corruption, political cronyism, nepotistic-dynastic rule which serves their own clan more than it serves their voters and people of Haryana they are ought to serve.In the land of fence-sitters, Millennium Post.How 5 families over 3 generations have controlled Haryana‚Äôs politics from day one, The Print,-29 Apr 2019.

There is significant evidence that these political dynasties use their political dominance over their respective regions to enrich themselves, using methods such as graft or outright bribery of legislators. Even relatively richer provinces could not become truly richer due to the dynastic politics. =Dynasties' conflict-of-interest creates corruption = Since the political dynasties hold significant economic power and their interests are overrepresented due to dynastic politics, it leads to the conflicts of interests and corruption. , 120 (22%) of India's 542 parliament members were accused of various crimes under India's First Information Report procedure. Many of the biggest scandals have involved high level government officials, including Cabinet Ministers and Chief Ministers, such as the 2010 Commonwealth Games scam (), the Adarsh Housing Society scam, the Coal Mining Scam (), the Mining Scandal and the Cash for Vote scams. The industries most vulnerable to corruption as: government-run social development projects, infrastructure development & real estate projects, mining, aerospace & defence, and Power & Utilities (2013 EY and 2011 KPMG). India ranked at 78th place out of 180 in the 2018 Corruption Perception Index and more than 50% of Indians had at some point or another paid a bribe to a public official to get a job done (Transparency International, 2008). The negative impact of dynasties on the economy and wealth of province can be explained by the \\"Carnegie Effect\\" named after the industrialist Andrew Carnegie who donated all his wealth for philanthropy to non-family members, because he believed the dynasts have less incentive of working hard if they are assured of inherited power, connections and wealth. Political dynasties prefer status quo and develop self-serving interests largely different from the interests of voters they were ought to be serving. Dynastic candidates, being almost exclusively from the upper classes, are naturally biased towards defending their own vested interests. =Misuse of state resources by dynasties for self- promotion= In a blatant act of self-promotion by misusing state institutes, the Bhupinder Singh Hooda led Congress, the most prolific dynastic party of India and Haryana, introduced a chapter titled \\"Haryana Ke Gaurav\\" (Pride of Haryana) in the curriculum of class V to teach students about the political dynasties in a glorified light i.e. highlighted only the positive aspects of dynast leaders related to top 5 prolific dynasties of the state, e.g. Devi Lal and Bansi Lal, Chotu Ram and Ranbir Singh Hooda, etc.Changes in Textbooks From next academic session: Hooda, Lal out; Tilak, Bhagat Singh in, Indian Express, 16 May 2016. Based on the recommendations by a committee that had members of NCERT and SCERT in 2016 this chapter was removed by the BJP government led by the Chief Minister Manohar Lal. It was replaced by a new chapter titled \\"gaurav Gatha\\" (Glorious Legends), which replaced the dynast leaders with the freedom fighters non-dynast leaders of national strature, including the greats such as Bhagat Singh, Vallabhbhai Patel, Lala Lajpat Rai and Lokmanya Tilak to name a few. To reinforce their political image and lineage to gain unfair \\"instant recognition\\" for multiple generations, dynasts engage in wastage of government resources and taxpayer's money, for example erecting numerous statues of the dynast leaders, naming multiple institutes and schemes after the same dynastic leaders of own clan, etc.; this money could have been better spent on the welfare of poor and the development of the state. To reverse and prevent this, there have been demands for the \\"anti-dynasty laws\\" and the \\"anti-dynasties pro-martyrs institution naming policies\\" to specifically exclude the dynasts and politicians, and to include the martyrs and the non- political prominent achievers in the specific area. To keep the rivals out of power and to prevent the rise of emerging challengers, the political dynasties often misuse state agencies, police police, vigilance bureau, false cases with planted evidence to persecute and harass their rivals in each district and village in a psychopathic manner.Modi-Shah‚Äôs BJP has taken India‚Äôs politics of vendetta to a new level, The Print, 21 Aug 2019. =Dynasties prevent the rise of talented non-dynasts = Dynastic politicians tend to be generally less capable compared to non-dynastic politicians, because of their reliance on dynastic connections rather than academic and professional competence for their position.Daniele, Gianmarco, and Benny Geys. \\"Born in the Purple: Political Dynasties and Politicians' Human Capital.\\" June 1, 2014. Accessed September 29, 2015. Unethical practices of Nepotism and cronyism have negative consequences because the truly qualified and talented people have to face injustices and it eventually leads to corruption and brain drains which creates the social discrimination. Research has found that the dynast members of parliament (MPs) are less like to have served at the grassroots politics, such as panchayat elections, than the non-dynastic MPs. Political dynasties collude to maintain the status quo, by preventing the non-dynastic better- skilled more-capable challengers/candidates being elected to the power. This in turn leads to the bureaucratic inefficiencies and underdevelopment, the lack of accountability and transparency in governance, and the resistance to adoption of new progressive-transformative ideas needed for the faster-paced development. =Sustaining and perpetuating the dynasties= Rise of political dynasties caused by the creation of family-controlled self-serving despotic non-democratic parties in democracy which breed nepotistic parasitic patron- psychophants hegemony. Dynasties sustain and perpetuate their power by the collaboration of competing dynasties aimed at maintaining their mutual hegemony and preventing the rise of others as new political challengers. The collaborating dynasties do so by building strong friendly and family ties outside the politics (usually inter-marrying across rival parties) to sustain each other, while keeping the facade of being the political adversaries. =Keeping the bastards honest= \\"Keep the bastards honest\\" (KTBH) is a popular political slogan in which the \\"bastards\\" refer to the major parties and/or politicians in general. To \\"keep the bastards honest\\" means \\"to hold a government to their promises\\" and \\"to look at both sides and choose the best.\\"Why voting for an independent is usually a complete waste of time, Sydney Morning Herald, 25 Feb 2018. In political sense it also means, an individual activist, civil society, NGOs or a smaller party holding accountable both the party in power as well as the major opposition parties, i.e. blind support of or alliance with none, but proactively offering the issue based support or opposition in the larger interest of the nation and society. One can not keep the bastards honest when they themselves are not honest or if they themselves are a bigger bastard than the entities they are trying to hold accountable, e.g. have views to the extreme side of either party.Can the Greens keep the bastards honest?, abc news, 14 Apr 2015. This slogan was coined by the Australian Democrats leader Don Chipp as his party's aim, which became a long-lived slogan.Cathy Madden, Research Paper, \\"Australian Democrats: the passing of an era\\", p. 2 and note 6, 27 March 2009; Retrieved 1 September 2013 To \\"Keep the bastards honest\\" is not a cover for or a form of frequent floor crossing, party switching, political horse trading or altering own ideology; it is a form of the political transparency and the conscience voting in line with the pre-established and pre-stated ideology. =Decline and demolition of dynasties= Parties go in decline with the death of the chief patron, internal squabbling for power among the members of controlling-family, rise of new non-dynastic charismatic leaders, anti-dynasty disgust among the voters with the increased literacy rate in the country, rising aspirations of the politically aware non-dynastic masses and civil society. Dynasties can be reduced and eliminated by implementing the anti- dynasty laws, stringent conflict of interest laws, stringent laws for the transparency in governance and party operations, mandatory intra-party democracy law as a precondition for maintaining the ongoing registration of the party, laws limiting the number of terms for the elected representatives and party officials, laws limiting the number of simultaneous candidates from the same families, laws to enforce a cooling period between the generations of dynasties for the entry into politics, developing grassroot leadership, institutionalised mechanism for the progression of grassroot leaders into state and national politics e.g. mandatory for MLA and MP to have served at panchayat or municipal level, strengthening the institutionalised role of the civil society in the enforcing the accountability and transparency in governance.Kanchan Chandra, 2016, Democratic Dynasties: State, Party and Family in Contemporary Indian Politics, page 263-onward.

In the 19th century, Devi Lal's grandfather Teja Ram Sihag (belonging to the 'Sihag' clan of Jats, but that surname is generally not used) came from Bikaner in Rajasthan and settled in Teja Khera village of Sirsa district. Teja Ram had three sons: Deva Ram, Asha Ram and Hukam Ram. Asharam had two sons, Lekhram and Tara Chand. Lekhram had two sons, Sahib Ram and Devi Lal. Due to Devi Lal, the obscure farming family became a political dynasty. Sahib Ram was the first politician from the family to be elected as MLA in 1938, under British rule. Fourteen years later, in 1952, Devi Lal followed in his footsteps, by becoming MLA.Om Prakash Chautala's ancestors came from Rajasthan, Times of India, 25 Jan 2013. Devi Lal had four sons, namely Partap Singh, Om Prakash Chautala, Ranjit Singh and Jagdish Chander. Partap Singh was MLA in the 1960s,In Chautala, villagers say family feud no surprise, Indian Express, 15 Nov 2018. Ranjit Singh was a Congress MP, Om Prakash Chautala became Chief Minister, and Jagdish died young, before he could join politics. Om Prakash Chautala has two sons, Ajay Singh Chautala and Abhay Singh Chautala. Both have been MLA and MP. Devi Lal's numerous grandsons, greatgrandsons and other family members are also in politics, such as Aditya Devilal, Dushyant Chautala and his brother Digvijay Chautala as well as their cousin Arjun Chautala. This clan, once dominant at the state level and now in decline due to divisions and internal family squabbling in the large clan, is struggling to revive their statewide hold while still retaining some pockets of influence in Hisar and Sirsa area. *Sahib Ram Sihag, Devi Lal's elder brother, first politician from the family, Congress MLA from Hisar in 1938 and 1947.Bahu Naina broke glass ceiling of Chautala family politics, Indian Express, 24 Jan 2019. :*Ganpat Ram, son of Sahib Ram ::*Kamalvir Singh, grandson of Sahib Ram and son of Ganpat Ram.

Lyn Miles (born August 5, 1944) is an American bio-cultural anthropologist and animal rights advocate. Miles is known for a 1970s experiment in which a baby orangutan named Chantek was videotaped during sign language acquisition. She was teaching sign language providing a full human experience in the immersive-participant-observation way, the same way human babies are taught during infancy. Life Miles was raised by her brother and has two other non-biological brothers. In 1978, she earned her PhD in anthropology from the University of Connecticut. Since 1993, she has lived in Atlanta, Georgia in order to be able to visit Chantek after he was transferred to the Yerkes National Primate Research Center and was sharing the responsibility for Chantek with her colleague Ann Southcombe who for seven years kept visiting Chantek. Work On the Chattanooga university campus, Miles had equipped a trailer home for Chantek, who had a full human experience during the experiment. She is currently a UC Foundation Professor of Anthropology at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, teaching courses that include physical anthropology, ape language, and linguistic anthropology.

As Prefect of Rh√¥ne he acquiesced in brutal reprisals in 1817 against former supporters of Bonaparte. He was an elected deputy from 1820 to 1822, then was made a peer of France. He served as Minister of the Navy (1824‚Äì29) and as Minister of Finance (1829‚Äì30). Chabrol resigned before the July Revolution of 1830, unwilling to remain associated with the increasingly repressive government, but remained a supporter of the Bourbon monarchy. Family Chabrol came from a notable bourgeois family from Auvergne. His great grandfather Jacques Chabrol (1649-1732) was a Protestant who converted to Catholicism in 1682 and was king's advocate in Riom. His grandfather Guillaume Michel de Chabrol (1714-1792) was king's counsel in Riom, a jurist and author of works on the customs and history of Auvergne. He made a large fortune and became an extensive landowner. He was knighted by Louis XV in 1767 and made a Counselor of State in 1782. His father Gaspard-Claude-Fran√ßois de Chabrol (1740-1816) served as an officer in the Dragoons, then joined the judiciary. His mother was Madelaine-Daisy Vissaguet. They married in 1766. Early career Christophe Andr√© Jean de Chabrol de Crouzol was born in Riom, Puy-de-D√¥me, on 16 November 1771, the second son of five sons and one daughter. He was destined to become a priest, and was raised in the congregation of the Oratorians. His father became involved in politics, and in 1789 was elected a deputy representing the nobility of Auvergne Third Estate in the Estates General, voting with the right and against the constitution of 1791. During the French Revolution Christophe de Chabrol refused to take the oath on the civil constitution of the clergy, and left the priesthood. His father also became a suspect during the Terror, and the family was imprisoned. They were not released until 1795. The titular king Louis XVIII made Gaspard de Chabrol a hereditary count. On 25 Thermidor Year XI (August 1803) Christophe de Chabrol became an auditor of the Council of State. On 11 August 1808 he was made a Knight of the Empire. In 1809 he was appointed Master of Requests (ma√Ætre des requ√™tes). He was sent to Tuscany as a member of the commission for liquidating the debts of that country. He was promoted Count of the Empire on 9 March 1810. In March 1811 he was appointed President of the Chamber at the imperial court in Paris. On 16 August 1811 he was appointed Quartermaster General of the Illyrian Provinces. In August 1813 Chabrol returned to Paris when the Austrian army advanced on Ljubljana. Bourbon Restoration In 1814 Chabrol supported the first Bourbon Restoration. He was appointed to the Finance section of the Council of State on 5 July 1814, and then to the prefecture of the Rh√¥ne on 22 November 1814. When he heard of the return of Napoleon from Elba, Chabrol tried to place Lyon in a state of defense. Seeing that resistance was futile, he left the city when Napoleon entered and joined the Count of Artois. He returned to Lyon after the Battle of Waterloo on 17 July 1815 and resumed his duties as prefect after the Austrians commanded by Ferdinand, Count of Bubna, had occupied the city. In 1817 Chabrol was caught up in the reactionary zeal of General Simon Canuel. He failed to stop the excesses that followed. He accepted the alleged conspiracy of 22 October 1816 which gave the pretext for installing the guillotine permanently and recalled the worst days of the Terror. On 5 September 1817 King Louis XVIII told General Marmont to restore peace. Canuel was dismissed and Chabrol recalled. Chabrol was appointed Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of the Interior on 24 September 1817. Chabrol left the ministry when √âlie, duc Decazes, replaced Joseph Lain√© as minister. On 16 July 1820 he resumed his duties at the Council of State. On 13 November 1820 he was elected deputy for the department of Puy-de-D√¥me. He sat with the government majority. On 23 January 1821 he was appointed head of the Directorate General of Registration and Estates. He was reelected on 10 October 1821. On 23 December 1823 he was made a peer of France. Minister Tomb of Christophe de Chabrol de Crouzol at Pasli√®res Chabrol was appointed Minister of the Navy in the Ministry of Joseph de Vill√®le on 4 August 1824. Although attacked for incompetence by the opposition journals, his term of office was marked by several achievements including formation of the Admiralty Board, restoration of maritime prefectures, creation of a naval academy, resumption of shipbuilding and the application of French law to the colonies. Chabrol was more moderate than his colleagues and did not approve of the dismissal of the National Guard. When the Vill√®le ministry fell, Chabrol was the only minister to retain his position in the Ministry of Jean-Baptiste de Martignac. However, when the Chamber of Deputies passed a motion that described the actions of the former Vill√®le ministry as \\"deplorable\\", Chabrol resigned, leaving office on 2 March 1828. Chabrol returned to office on 7 August 1829 as Minister of Finance in the Ministry of Jules de Polignac at the urgent request of King Charles X, although he did not conceal his misgivings about the composition of the cabinet. He was able to raise a loan of 80 million francs, establish new financial regulations that saved 6 million francs, and provide a reserve of 60 million francs for public works. He resigned on 18 May 1830, concerned that the next elections would bring in a majority hostile to the repressive measures of the king and Jules de Polignac. Chabrol took his seat in the Chamber of Peers. In the debates he fought the motions to exile Charles X and his family, and opposed the Bonaparte family. Christophe de Chabrol de Crouzol died at the Ch√¢teau de Chabannes, Pasli√®res, Puy-de-D√¥me, on 7 October 1836, aged 64. Bibliography Chabrol was the author of various reports as a deputy, peer or minister.

It is a Pennsylvania steel through truss bridge, built by the Boston Bridge Works in 1928. The bridge consists of a single span with a clear span of 352' and an overall length of 354'10\\". The roadbed is 20'7\\" wide, with a vertical clearance of 14'7\\". The bridge is approximately 25' above the river. The western (Vermont) abutment is made of split granite quarried from nearby Fairlee Mountain, while the eastern abutment is an early concrete construction built in 1908 by John Storrs for an earlier bridge. The bridge underwent a major renovation in 1993 which included the addition of a sidewalk (under which utilities were laid) and replacement of much of the bridge decking. The bridge was built in the aftermath of major rain and flooding in 1927 along the Connecticut River, which washed away several bridges and caused significant damage in Vermont. The Piermont Bridge was the longest bridge built after this flooding, replacing a c. 1875 two-span Town lattice truss bridge. The center pier of the older bridge was knocked down to the water line and is still visible. The eastern abutment, built in 1908 in a relatively early use of structural concrete, needed to be strengthened to accommodate the increased weight of the new steel bridge. This was accomplished by adding new concrete to the land side of the abutment, preserving the earlier work. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. It is owned by the states of New Hampshire (90%) and Vermont (10%).

She has been consulted by police forces and industry in almost 300 investigations in several countries and has been instrumental in solving several high-profile crimes, including the killing of Sarah Payne, Millie Dowler, the cold case of Christopher Laverack, the Soham murders, and the Ipswich serial murders. Early life and education Wiltshire was born in 1942 in the coal-mining valleys of Monmouthshire, South Wales. Her schooling was interrupted from the age of seven when she sustained serious burns in a domestic accident and then repeated chest infections which caused permanent damage to her lungs. She spent her convalescence reading encyclopaedias. After working as a medical laboratory technician, she moved on to a career in the business world and then studied botany at King's College London. She lectured there for several years in microbial and general ecology before taking up a post at the Institute of Archaeology at University College London. She was later responsible for setting up a Masters' course in Forensic Archaeological Science which ran successfully and continued after she left UCL. High-profile cases As a forensic scientist in the Soham murder inquiry, Wiltshire's analysis of soil and plant evidence from clothing, footwear, and a vehicle, yielded trace evidence that linked Ian Huntley to the place where the victims (Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells) were found. Observation and experimentation of plant growth at the deposition site enabled her to estimate the time that the girls had been placed in the ditch very accurately. Her evidence was important in the conviction of Ian Huntley. In the 2007 Christopher Laverack murder case, three decades after the nine-year-old's murder, Wiltshire linked the unusual pollen and other plant matter on the victim's clothing, along with the ornamental brick used to keep him submerged after death, with that found on the property of his uncle, Melvyn Read, thus providing substantial evidence to implicate Read. The investigation, spanning three decades, was Humberside Police's longest-running unsolved murder case, and was solved in 2012.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-19115272  Other activities  Wiltshire is an Independent Councillor on Mole Valley District Council, along with her husband, David Hawksworth.

Pressure overload refers to the pathological state of cardiac muscle in which it has to contract while experiencing an excessive afterload. Pressure overload may affect any of the four chambers of the heart, though the term is most commonly applied to one of the two ventricles. Chronic pressure overload leads to concentric hypertrophy of the cardiac muscle, which can in turn lead to heart failure, myocardial ischaemia or, in extreme cases, outflow obstruction. Causes Any obstruction to the outflow of one of the chambers of the heart can lead to pressure overload. =Left ventricular pressure overload= *Aortic stenosis *Hypertension *Coarctation of the aorta =Right ventricular pressure overload= *Pulmonary stenosis *Pulmonary hypertension Signs and symptoms A forceful apex beat indicates left ventricular pressure overload, while a right ventricular heave suggests right ventricular pressure overload. Other signs provide evidence for specific causes of pressure overload. Hypertension is diagnosed by sphygmomanometry. A narrow pulse pressure is a sign of aortic stenosis. The chest x-ray may show pulmonary hyperaemia in the case of pulmonary hypertension, and pulmonary oligemia in pulmonary stenosis. Pulmonary hypertension is also associated with chronic lung disease. Coarctation of the aorta presents with a significant difference in blood pressure between the upper and lower limbs, a systolic murmur or radiofemoral delay. Treatment Treatment will depend on the underlying cause.

Based in Espoo, Finland, it was established in 2014 following the acquisition of Nokia's Devices and Services division by Microsoft in a deal valued at ‚Ç¨5.4 billion, which was completed in April 2014. Nokia's then-CEO, Stephen Elop, joined Microsoft as president of its Devices division following the acquisition, and the acquisition was part of Steve Ballmer's strategy to turn Microsoft into a \\"devices and services\\" company. Under a 10-year licensing agreement, Microsoft Mobile held rights to sell feature phones running the S30+ platform under the Nokia brand. Originally Microsoft had established a major partnership with Nokia in 2011, in which the company exclusively produced smartphones using the Windows Phone platform, and promoted Microsoft services on its feature phone products (including Bing search). Microsoft also licensed Nokia Maps data for its own mapping services. While Nokia's resultant Lumia range had the largest market share out of all Windows Phone vendors, Nokia's overall market share was falling rapidly due to competition from other major vendors, resulting in a dire financial situation. In September 2013, Microsoft announced its acquisition of Nokia's devices and services businesses, which closed with the formation of a Finnish subsidiary, Microsoft Mobile. On smartphones, the Nokia name was phased out in favour of Microsoft branding on future Lumia products. While the Lumia range continued to be successful, especially with low- and mid-range devices targeting emerging markets, sales of both Microsoft-manufactured smartphones and feature phones began to see major declines, due primarily to the rapidly-deflating market share of Windows Phone. In 2015, Microsoft took a US$7.8 billion write- down on the Nokia purchase, and announced layoffs of 7,800 employees, primarily within Microsoft's phone business. In May 2016, Microsoft abandoned its mobile business, selling the Nokia feature phone line and trademark rights to the Finnish startup HMD Global, and announcing that it planned to cut up to 1,350 positions in Finland and focus on offering its productivity services on competing mobile platforms. In 2017, Microsoft executive Joe Belfiore revealed that Microsoft had ceased the development of new Windows phones and new features for Windows 10 Mobile, citing the losses in market share and lack of app development.  History  A Microsoft Kin device from 2010, Microsoft's first foray in mobile phone hardware With the acquisition of Nokia's devices and services division, Microsoft re-entered the smartphone market. In Microsoft's previous attempt, Microsoft Kin, a result of the acquisition of Danger, Inc., had been poorly received. = 2011‚Äì2013: Partnership between Microsoft and Nokia = Nokia Lumia 800, Nokia's first device running Windows Phone. In February 2011, Nokia CEO Stephen Elop and Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer jointly announced a major business partnership between the two companies, which would see Nokia adopt Windows Phone as the primary platform for its future smartphones, replacing both Symbian and MeeGo. The deal also included the use of Bing as the search engine on Nokia devices, and the integration of Nokia Maps into Microsoft's own mapping services. Nokia announced that it would still release one device running the MeeGo platform in 2011, but that it would devote fewer resources to future development of the platform, and would phase out Symbian entirely. Aligning with Microsoft had been considered a possibility by analysts, due to Elop's prior employment with the company. As Nokia was the largest mobile phone and smartphone manufacturer worldwide at the time, it was suggested the alliance would help Windows Phone, but from the beginning of 2011, until 2013, Nokia fell from #1 to #10 in smartphone sales. In June 2011, Nokia was overtaken by Apple as the world's biggest smartphone maker by volume. In Q2 2011, amid falling sales, Nokia posted a loss of ‚Ç¨368 million, after having realized a profit of ‚Ç¨227 million in Q2 2010. In September 2011, Nokia announced it would cut another 3,500 jobs worldwide, including the closure of its Cluj factory in Romania, after having cut as many as 7,000 the previous April. In August 2011 Chris Weber, head of Nokia's subsidiary in the U.S., stated that \\"The reality is if we are not successful with Windows Phone, it doesn't matter what we do [elsewhere]. He further added, North America is a priority for Nokia [‚Ä¶] because it is a key market for Microsoft. On 26 October 2011, Nokia unveiled its first Windows Phone 7-based devices, the high-end Lumia 800 and the mid-range Lumia 710, at its Nokia World conference. After this announcement, Nokia's share price fell about 14%, its biggest drop since July 2009. Nokia's smartphone sales, which had been increasing, collapsed. Market share of Symbian, Windows Mobile and Windows Phone 7 among US smartphone owners from Q1 2011 to Q2 2012 according to Nielsen Company. Nokia reported sales \\"well above 1 million\\" of its Lumia line in 2011, 2 million sales for the first quarter of 2012, and 4 million for the second quarter of 2012, when Nokia sold only 600,000 smartphones (Symbian and Windows Phone 7) in North America. By comparison, Nokia had sold more than 30 million Symbian devices worldwide in Q4 2010 and the Nokia N8 alone had sold almost 4 million in its first quarter. In Q2 2012, 26 million iPhones and 105 million Android phones shipped, compared to only 6.8 million devices with Symbian and 5.4 million with Windows Phone. In announcing an alliance with Groupon, Elop declared, \\"The competition... is not with other device manufacturers, it's with Google.\\" In June 2012, Nokia chairman Risto Siilasmaa told journalists that Nokia had a contingency plan in the event that Windows Phone failed, but did not specify what it was. On 8 February 2012, Nokia announced 4,000 layoffs at smartphone manufacturing plants in Europe by the end of 2012, to move assembly closer to component suppliers in Asia. On 14 June 2012, Nokia announced 10,000 layoffs globally by the end of 2013 and that it would shut production and research sites in Finland, Germany, and Canada, in line with continuing losses and the stock price falling to its lowest point since 1996. In total, Nokia laid off 24,500 employees by the end of 2013. On 18 June 2012, Moody's downgraded Nokia's bond rating to junk status. Nokia's CEO admitted that the company's inability to foresee rapid changes in the mobile phone industry was one of the major reasons for the problems. On 4 May 2012, a group of Nokia investors filed a class action against the company, as a result of disappointing sales. On 22 August 2012, it was reported that a group of Finnish Nokia investors were considering gathering signatures for the removal of Elop as CEO. In December 2012, to cut costs during a period of falling revenues, Nokia announced that it would be selling its headquarters, Nokia House, for ‚Ç¨170 million, and leasing the use of it back long-term. In January 2013, Nokia reported sales of 6.6 million smartphones for Q4 2012, consisting of 2.2 million Symbian and 4.4 million Lumia devices (Windows Phone 7 and 8). In North America, only 700,000 mobile phones were sold, including smartphones. In May 2013, Nokia released the Asha platform for its low-end smartphone devices. The Verge commented that this might have been recognition on the part of Nokia that Windows Phones weren't selling at the bottom end of the smartphone market fast enough and that they might be \\"hedging their commitment\\" to the Windows Phone platform. In the same month, Nokia announced its partnership with the world's largest cellular operator, China Mobile, to offer Nokia's new Windows-based phone, the Lumia 920, as the Lumia 920T, an exclusive Chinese variant. The partnership was a bid by Nokia to connect with China Mobile's 700 million-person customer base. Following the second quarter of 2013, Nokia reported an operating loss of ‚Ç¨115 million (¬£98.8 million), with revenues falling 24% to ‚Ç¨5.7 billion, despite Lumia's sales figures exceeding those of BlackBerry's handsets during the same period. Over the nine-quarters prior to the second quarter of 2013, Nokia sustained ‚Ç¨4.1 billion worth of operating losses. The company experienced particular problems in both China and the U.S.; in the former, Nokia's handset revenues were the lowest since 2002, while in the U.S., \\"Nokia continues to show no signs of recovery in the US market. High investments, high expectations, low results.\\" In July 2013, Nokia announced that Lumia sales were 7.4 million for the second quarter of the year ‚Äì a record high, but Windows Phones in general still lacked momentum and lacked global market share, although scoring progressively better than other competing mobile platforms such as BlackBerry. In June 2013, despite Nokia's falling commitment to the Windows Phone platform, Nokia's share of that market was a dominant 83.3% of all such phones sold; and by October 2013, Nokia's Lumia line held over a 90% market share of all Windows Phones in use. A part of the reason Nokia couldn't make a profit was that their low priced Nokia Lumia 520 dominated the market while high-end models barely sold. = 2013‚Äì2014: Acquisition of Nokia's mobile phone business = On 2 September 2013, Microsoft announced that it would acquire Nokia's mobile device business in a deal worth ‚Ç¨3.79 billion, along with another ‚Ç¨1.65 billion to license Nokia's portfolio of patents for 10 years; a deal totaling over ‚Ç¨5.4 billion. Steve Ballmer considered the purchase to be a \\"bold step into the future\\" for both companies, primarily as a result of its recent collaboration. It was also part of Ballmer's long-term vision of transforming Microsoft into a \\"devices and services\\" company. Pending regulatory approval, the acquisition was originally expected to close in early 2014. In an interview published in Helsingin Sanomat, former Nokia executive Anssi Vanjoki commented that the Microsoft deal was \\"inevitable\\" due to the \\"failed strategy\\" of Stephen Elop. In an Helsingin Sanomat interview from 2018, Nokia chairman Risto Siilasmaa revealed that Microsoft were also in talks to purchase HTC, another Windows Phone vendor, before they opted to purchase the Nokia business. In March 2014, it was announced that the acquisition of Nokia's mobile phone business would not be completed by the end of March as expected, but instead was delayed until April of that year due to problems with regulators in Asia.DELAYED: Microsoft Won't Close Its $7.2 Billion Buy Of Nokia Until April, Business Insider, 24 March 2014 The acquisition of Nokia's mobile phone business by Microsoft was closed on 25 April 2014 for \\"slightly more\\" than the originally stated ‚Ç¨5.44 billion. Nokia's mobile phone assets became a part of Microsoft Mobile, a new subsidiary of Microsoft based in Finland. While Microsoft licensed the Nokia brand under a 10-year agreement, Nokia agreed not to use its name on smartphones and to be subject to a non- compete clause preventing it from producing any mobile devices under the Nokia name through 31 December 2015. Microsoft acquired the Asha and Lumia brands as part of the deal, a license to use the Nokia name, as well as the Nokia PureView, ClearBlack, Surge, Mural, and Symbian-related trademarks. Further, the deal included the acquisition of 8,500 design-related patents by Microsoft, and license on 30,000 \\"utility\\" patents on a non-exclusive basis for 10 years. As part of the deal, a number of Nokia executives joined Microsoft: Stephen Elop became the head of Microsoft's devices team (which oversees products such as Xbox and Surface); Risto Siilasmaa replaced Elop as interim CEO, before the appointment of Rajeev Suri. On 17 July 2014, it was reported that a major round of layoffs, totaling over 18,000 across the entire company, would occur at Microsoft over the following year. The majority of these layoffs were related to the integration of Nokia's former staff into Microsoft, in an effort to reduce redundancy. It was also reported that Microsoft had ended future development of Nokia's Asha, Series 40, and X lines, in favor of focusing exclusively on Windows Phone. Shortly after the acquisition, Microsoft discontinued Nokia's smartwatch prototype, codenamed \\"Moonraker\\", dropping it in favour of the Microsoft Band. = 2014‚Äì2017: As a subsidiary of Microsoft, rebranding from Nokia to Microsoft, divestment and closure =  2014  Microsoft Lumia 535, the first Microsoft branded Lumia device Rebranding started in 2014. In March 2014, Nokia Mail and Nokia Chat were closed, offering migration services to Microsoft's Outlook.com and Skype until April 2015. All Nokia accounts were closed on 25 April 2015. Most of Nokia's social media sites were rebranded as Microsoft Lumia rather than Microsoft Mobile, to emphasize their focus on Windows Phone as opposed to other Nokia mobile phones. Windows Phone social network pages were rebranded as well, Nokia Conversations being rebranded as Lumia Conversations, and NokNok.tv as Lumia Conversations UK. The rebranding was not entirely consistent, as the Nokia Army, launched in 2012, became the Spartan Nation. The support site for legacy phones, accessories, as well as other Nokia- branded devices and services, Nokia Discussions, was renamed the Microsoft Mobile Community. In July 2014, it was reported by evleaks that Microsoft was attempting to license the Nokia name in a co-branding scheme, which would have seen future devices branded as \\"Nokia by Microsoft\\". After the acquisition of Nokia's mobile device business by Microsoft, several Lumia devices were unveiled by Microsoft Mobile in September 2014 that still carried the Nokia name, including the Lumia 830 and Lumia 735. Nokia's mobile applications retained by Microsoft were rebranded as \\"Lumia\\". In September 2014, Microsoft announced Windows 10 operating system, a common platform for smartphones, tablets, laptops and Xbox. It was made available for their Lumia line of smartphones.Announcing Windows 10 Due to the position of Microsoft Lumia devices being first-party hardware by Microsoft, Lumia handsets were the first to receive the Windows Insider preview. In October 2014, Microsoft announced that future Lumia devices would be branded with the \\"Microsoft\\" name and logo rather than \\"Nokia\\". In November 2014, Microsoft announced its first self branded phone, Microsoft Lumia 535. In November 2014 The Lumia Beta Apps division launched the Lumia Cinemagraph Beta which migrated content from Nokia's website to Microsoft OneDrive and subsequently implemented this feature in Lumia Cinemagraph. Previously cinemagraphs used to be synchronized via the Nokia Memories site, the change was made in relation to migrating all content from Nokia's sites to Microsoft's services. In December 2014, Microsoft discontinued the Nokia Sync service, which used Nokia's account service to synchronize contacts and general phone information, in favour of other offerings such as Microsoft OneDrive, which uses Microsoft accounts as part of the transition from Nokia accounts to Microsoft accounts.  2015‚Äì2017  A Microsoft Authorised Reseller Store in Hanoi, Vietnam Microsoft Mobile office building in Hervanta, Tampere, Finland To compete in developing markets, Microsoft launched various low- and mid-range devices‚Äîsuch as the Lumia 430 Dual SIM, 532, 435, 640, 640 XL, and 540 Dual SIM‚Äîto boost Windows Phone sales and increase market share. In Q2 2015, Lumia sold 10.5 million devices, compared to 8.2 million during the same quarter in the prior year. As a consequence of the Microsoft Lumia 535 being as popular as its predecessor, the Nokia Lumia 520, in key markets such as India and Brazil, Microsoft would not concentrate on releasing a high end Microsoft Lumia device until the launch of Windows 10. In Q2 2015, feature phone sales declined year- over-year, with a total of 40 million being sold for a total revenue of $2.28 billion, and a gross margin of $330 million (14%), being significantly lower than previous years due to a global decline in the demand for feature phones in favour of smartphones. In Q3 2015, Lumia sales increased 6.5% over the previous year, a total of 8.6 million Lumia handsets being sold (an 18% increase). But with declining sales of 25.7 million non-Lumia phones, Q3 2015 showed a decline overall. Despite the increased Lumia sales, costs exceeded sales revenue by $4 million, and Microsoft posted a loss of 12 cents per phone sold. In February 2015, Microsoft stated that most Lumia devices would be able to upgrade from Windows Phone 8.1 to Windows 10 Mobile. Joe Belfiore said that Microsoft was \\"working on\\" a limited version of 10 for low-end devices with 512 MB of RAM, citing the Nokia Lumia 520, which at the time represented 24.5% of all Windows Phone devices sold. On 28 April 2015, Microsoft opened the first Microsoft Priority Reseller Store, in the Indian city of Gurgaon, Haryana, as a move to rebrand all their Nokia stores worldwide. At the time Microsoft had 15,684 retail outlets and 324 Nokia Care centres. In addition to selling phones, the stores would also offer Surface and Xbox devices. Of India's 8,872 stores only 441 would become priority resellers, while the rest would be rebranded as Microsoft Mobile Reseller stores. On 3 June 2015, Microsoft announced the new Nokia Series 30+ powered Nokia 105 and Nokia 105 Dual SIM devices, which would be primarily marketed to business and travelling users, first-time mobile telephone owners, and as \\"a back up device\\" for smartphone owners. In Q4 2015, Microsoft managed to sell only 19.4 million feature phones, compared to 30.3 million in the prior year. In June 2015, Microsoft took over naming rights to Nokia Theatre L.A. Live, a 7,100 seat concert hall in Los Angeles, renaming it the Microsoft Theatre, supplying and installing new AV equipment, and renovating public spaces. L.A. Live's 40,000-square-foot outdoor plaza would be known as Microsoft Square; and Club Nokia, a 2,300 seat venue in the Plaza, would also be renamed. On 8 July 2015, Microsoft announced a planned restructuring of Microsoft Mobile, including a $7.6 billion write down on the acquisition of Nokia, planned layoffs of up to 7,800 jobs, and a plan to downsize its first-party smartphone business, releasing fewer devices per year and pulling out of underperforming markets. New Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella stated that the company planned to have a \\"more effective and focused phone portfolio\\", and aimed to \\"create a vibrant Windows ecosystem including our first-party device family.\\" In October 2015, Microsoft announced the first Lumia devices running on Windows 10 Mobile, the Lumia 950, 950 XL, and 550, the first two being high-end devices, the latter a budget phone. In February 2016, the Lumia 650, which runs on Windows 10 Mobile, was launched. It was primarily targeted towards mid-range consumers.Microsoft Lumia 650 launched at $199: Here are the top specs In April 2016, it was revealed that 2.3 million Lumia devices were sold in the previous quarter, a major drop compared to 2015. The rapidly falling sales, coupled with Windows Phone market share dropping below 1%, led to Microsoft announcing on 23 May the \\"streamlining\\" of the business. It would lay off \\"up to 1,850 jobs worldwide\\", with up to 1,350 of those in Finland. The company also wrote off US$900 million from the Nokia acquisition. Microsoft planned to complete most of these job cuts by the end of 2016, with the rest being completed by July 2017. The company stated that it would continue to develop Windows 10 Mobile, support existing Lumia and future third-party devices (implicating that it would no longer produce new Lumia models), and \\"embrace other mobile platforms with our productivity services\\". The same month, Microsoft sold its Nokia feature phone business to HMD Global, a Finnish startup backed by former Nokia executives. The Foxconn subsidiary FIH Mobile acquired a factory in Vietnam, as well as other distribution and manufacturing assets, from Microsoft Mobile as well. HMD and FIH announced that they would collaborate on developing and manufacturing new devices under the Nokia trademark (having reached a new 10-year license for the brand, and the Android-based Nokia 6 smartphone as its first device), with input from Nokia on design and incorporation of its technologies. In October 2017, Microsoft executive Joe Belfiore revealed that Microsoft would no longer develop new phone hardware, and that Windows 10 Mobile would only receive maintenance releases and patches from then on, citing its low market share and Microsoft's abandonment of its mobile business.  Hardware products  = Lumia = Lumia 950 Lumia was a line of touchscreen smartphones and, previously, tablet computers, introduced in November 2011. All Lumia mobile telephones run on the Windows Phone operating system. The only Lumia tablet Lumia 2520, running Windows RT, was introduced in November 2013 and has been discontinued.Is Windows RT dead? Microsoft stops making Nokia Lumia 2520 ITworld The Lumia is Microsoft's flagship phone portfolio. In October 2014, Microsoft officially announced that it would phase out the Nokia brand in its promotion and production of Lumia smartphones, and that future Lumia models would be branded solely with the name and logo of Microsoft. In November 2014, Microsoft announced its first self-branded phone, Microsoft Lumia 535. Rebranding the Lumia line from \\"Nokia\\" to \\"Microsoft\\" did not affect sales, though some critics believed that the change might influence consumers' decisions due to Nokia being an established phone brand, compared to Microsoft. In October 2015, Microsoft announced the first Lumia devices running on Windows 10 Mobile platform, the Lumia 950, Lumia 950 XL, and Lumia 550. In addition. Microsoft stated that most Lumia devices would be able to upgrade from Windows Phone 8/8.1 to Windows 10, from December 2015. In October 2017, Microsoft executive Joe Belfiore revealed that Microsoft would no longer develop new phone hardware, and that Windows 10 Mobile would only receive maintenance releases and patches from then on, citing its low market share and Microsoft's abandonment of its mobile business. For its Microsoft Lumia series Microsoft Mobile created such exclusive content as the Lumia imaging apps (that make use of the PureView technology on higher end Lumia devices) and new software was often tested through the Lumia Beta Apps. = Nokia X = The Nokia X In mid- September 2013, a media report revealed that Nokia tested the Android operating system on both its Lumia and Asha hardware. On 11 December 2013, a report showed that development of the Asha-like device, codenamed \\"Normandy\\", was continuing, despite the finalisation of Nokia's acquisition by Microsoft.This is Nokia's Android phone In February 2014, in Barcelona, Spain, the Nokia X family was unveiled at Mobile World Congress. These devices, which were aimed towards emerging markets, run a modified version of Android known as Nokia X Software Platform, which was aligned towards Microsoft services and did not use Google Play Store. In a company memo released in July 2014, it was announced that, as part of cutbacks, Microsoft would end the Asha, Series 40, and X range entirely, in favor of solely producing and encouraging the use of Windows Phone products. = Asha = Nokia Asha 501 The Asha series consisted of feature phones and low-end smartphones targeted mainly at emerging markets. The series has a mixture of full-touchscreen, \\"touch and type\\", QWERTY, and traditional T9-keypad devices. Originally, the Asha devices ran on Nokia's veteran operating system Series 40. Nokia later created the Asha platform as a result of their acquisition of Smarterphone. In May 2013, the Asha 501 became the first device running under the new OS, and all new Ashas since have been running on the new Asha platform.Rigg, Jamie, \\"Nokia unveils the touchscreen Asha 501 with new software platform, we go hands-on (video)\\", Engadget, 9 May 2013 During the July 2014 job cuts and restructuring at Microsoft, these device lines were moved to \\"maintenance mode\\", and would be discontinued, along with Nokia X and Series 40, in favour of solely producing Windows Phone products. = Series 40 = Nokia 6300 Series 40, or S40, was a software platform and user interface (UI) on Nokia's broad range of mid-tier feature phones, as well as on some of the Vertu line of luxury phones. It was one of the world's most widely used mobile phone platforms. On 25 January 2012, Nokia announced that the company had sold over 1.5 billion Series 40 devices. Although S40 has more features than the Series 30 platform, it was not used for smartphones, where Nokia primarily used Windows Phone and, until 2012, Symbian. However, in 2012 and 2013, several Series 40 phones from the Asha line, such as the 308, 309, and 311, were advertised as \\"smartphones\\" although they did not support smartphone features like multitasking or a full-fledged HTML browser. In July 2014, it was announced that Microsoft would discontinue Series 40. = Series 30+ = The Nokia 215, which runs on the Series 30+ platform. Series 30+ is a software platform and user interface that was used by Microsoft Mobile for its entry-level mobile devices.Tung, Liam, \\"Microsoft's new Nokia 130 arrives for $25\\", ZDNet, 11 August 2014 The first Series 30+ device was the Nokia 130,Trenholm, Rich, \\"Nokia 130 lasts more than a month costs 19 Euros\\", CNet, 11 August 2014Rickn√§s, Mikael, \\"Microsoft still believes in basic phones, launches Nokia 130 for $25\\", PCWorld, 11 August 2014 which had basic features such as a flashlight, FM radio, USB charging, video playback from microSD cards, and Bluetooth and USB connectivity, but no internet access. The Nokia 215, released in 2014, allowed users to browse the internet with Bing and MSN Weather and came pre-installed with Opera Mini. In June 2015, Microsoft further expanded the line of Nokia-branded feature phones with the Nokia 105 aimed specifically at developing nations, and named after an earlier model with the same target audience, but marketed also towards present smartphone owners, being \\"perfect for those looking to own their first mobile phone or for those needing a reliable back-up phone for travel and fun.\\" In the third quarter of 2015, the Nokia 222 was released. It featured a larger, 2.4-inch screen.Nokia 222 launched In December 2015, the Nokia 230 was the last Nokia phone from Microsoft. It had an aluminium body, a 2 megapixel front-facing camera, and a dedicated selfie camera key.Nokia 230 Series 30+ still lives today as part of HMD Global. Nokia 100 = Series 30 = Series 30, or S30, was a software platform and user interface created by Nokia for its entry-level mobile devices. S30 phones are not capable of running Java apps. By mid 2014, Microsoft discontinued S30 for its Nokia-branded mobile devices. = Mobile accessories = Besides phones Microsoft Mobile also produces mobile-phone accessories such as the Bluetooth enabled Treasure Tags. In newer devices Microsoft has bundled the Swedish company Coloud's headsets as opposed to first-party hardware. In late 2014, Microsoft launched a portable battery charger called Microsoft Portable Power, succeeded by Microsoft Portable Dual Chargers.  Treasure Tag  Treasure Tag, originally Nokia Treasure Tag, is an NFC and Bluetooth enabled keychain companion to Lumia devices. When Treasure Tags are attached to small valuables, such as keys or wallets, the Lumia device can show a map to help locate them. Treasure Tag Mini, originally Nokia Treasure Tag Mini, was launched by Microsoft in 2014 as a successor to the original Treasure Tag. It added support for iOS and Android (including Nokia X devices). Compared to the original, the Treasure Tag Mini comes in fewer colours, has shorter battery life, lacks NFC capabilities, and has no notification tones.  Corporate affairs  = Corporate governance = When Nokia's devices and services group entered Microsoft's workforce, former Nokia CEO Stephen Elop became the new head of Microsoft Devices, which includes other hardware such as the Surface and Xbox. Elop was joined by Nokia executives Jo Harlow (smart devices), Juha Putkiranta (operations), Timo Toikkanen (feature phones), and Chris Weber (sales and marketing), who gained similar positions at Microsoft. Microsoft Devices retained most of Nokia's groups, including the hardware and studios teams, while software teams were merged with Microsoft's respective teams. The transition worked without much complication, as Elop had previously reorganised Nokia's structure to be similar to Microsoft's. Many former Nokia executives have joined other projects at Microsoft, an example being Pasi Saarikko who became Principal Hardware Engineering Manager at the Microsoft HoloLens project. On 17 June 2015, as part of a reorganisation, Microsoft announced that former Nokia executives Stephen Elop, and Jo Harlow would be leaving the company. As part of the structural reorganisation of Microsoft the Devices and Studios group was merged with the Operating Systems group to form the new Windows and Devices group, which is headed by Terry Myerson. Other than Microsoft Lumia, this new engineering group includes Microsoft hardware divisions such as Surface, Band, HoloLens, and Xbox, as well as the Windows operating system. = Headquarters = Microsoft Mobile's former head office Microsoft Mobile's head office was Microsoft Talo in Keilaniemi, Espoo, Finland. The building was previously named Nokia House, and was part of Microsoft's acquisition of Nokia's device business, becoming Microsoft Mobile's headquarters in April 2014 and receiving its new name. It is now occupied by both Microsoft Finland and Tieto.

GSA member schools share and implement sustainability best practices and promote connections between schools, communities, and the environments that sustain them. GSA does this by creating peer-to-peer forums, exchanging resources, offering original programs and curriculum, and connecting youth to nature. The sustainability coordinators that participate in the network are composed of faculty, staff, students, administrators, and other school decision makers. History The GSA was formed in October 2007 as a result of Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg‚Äôs PlaNYC and related challenge to all NYC facilities to reduce carbon emissions by 30% by 2050, with support from the NYC Mayor's Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability, New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), Clinton Climate Initiative (CCI), Consolidated Edison, National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS) and National Business Officers Association (NBOA). The Allen- Stevenson School in NYC hosted the first GSA planning session that convened schools to address climate change and \\"what schools can do about it\\", and review the GSA Commitment. With additional guidance from the American College & University Presidents' Climate Commitment (ACUPCC), Second Nature and AASHE, the GSA primary and secondary school climate commitment was further refined. In November 2007, with a signatory group of 40 schools, the GSA was launched to the public at the US Green Building Council annual GreenBuild Conference when President Bill Clinton highlighted the GSA in his keynote speech. It is currently listed as one of the organizations committed to the Climate Education and Literacy Initiative launched by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) Green Schools Alliance today The 501c3 nonprofit organization connects more than 9,000 schools, districts, and organizations worldwide, representing more than 5 million students in 48 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and 88 countries. Schools are participating individually or and as entire school districts to share sustainability best practices and reduce their environmental footprint. In January 2016, 21 school districts formed the Green Schools Alliance District Collaborativewhich will harness the collective power of schools to support greener, more efficient solutions. These districts will build and share best practices, leverage their combined purchasing power to increase access to sustainable alternatives, promote market transformation, and influence policy decisions. Charter members of the District Collaborative affect the lives of 3.6 million children in 5,726 schools with more than 550 million square feet of building area. Membership to the GSA's online community is free. Schools and districts can also pledge the Sustainability Leadership where principals, heads of school, and superintendents pledge to take action in these areas: Reduce Our Climate & Ecological Impact, Educate & Engage Our Community, and Transform Our Culture. Programs GSA programs integrate education and action and aggregate and quantify progress. Using the building and campus as a teaching tool, students work alongside faculty and staff on projects from recycling, weatherizing, conducting energy audits, changing lights and replacing old boilers to improving science and technology education, restoring wetlands and planting green roofs. Best practices ripple outward from schools to families, to the workplace.

She was 23 years old at the time of her death, which had occurred after enduring several weeks of extreme neglect and both physical and sexual abuse. New developments in the case emerged after her body was exhumed on October 16, 2013, including isotope analysis. In November 2019, authorities announced that she was successfully identified after two decades. Additionally, a suspect remains in police custody for her murder. Both the victim's and the accused murderer's name were released on November 8, 2019. Johnson's murder received national attention both preceding and following her identification. Discovery of the body Johnson's body was discovered within the first rows of a cornfield on July 21, 1999, by a father and daughter walking their dogs. The location was along 92nd Street in Raymond, Wisconsin. Her death had occurred within one day prior to the discovery of her body. Johnson's injuries were apparent and her right arm was bent \\"unnaturally\\" behind her. Because it had rained on the night her body was dumped, little evidence of the perpetrator was found, although she was placed at the scene about 12 hours prior, before precipitation occurred. The witness stated the body had not been at the location the day before. Based on marks on her body, she appeared to have been dragged 25 feet from the roadside. She wore a man's shirt, gray in color, with a floral design on the front. After contacting the shirt's manufacturer, it was learned that this type of shirt was first sold in 1984. She was also wearing black sweatpants. No additional clothing was found, including footwear. Examination During the autopsy, multiple injuries were observed across her body, and it was determined she had endured several weeks of neglect in addition to long-term physical abuse. She was malnourished and suffered from an untreated infection in her left elbow. The abuse increased in severity in the days immediately prior to her death, and she had also been sexually assaulted. Potential chemical burns were identified on 25% of her body and road rash was also observed. Her nose was broken, as were several of her ribs, although some of the latter injuries occurred after death. A \\"cauliflower ear\\" deformity may have been caused by the recent increase of abuse she suffered, either from beating or being pulled. Sharp-force trauma was also evident on the same ear. Additionally, the examination suggested she may have been a cognitively disabled individual. It was believed that she was most likely 18 to 35 years old. Her front incisors protruded from her mouth, and decay was present on many teeth, some of which were missing. Her curly hair was reddish-brown, collar-length, and appeared to have blond highlights. Johnson's eye color was difficult to discern, but listed as brown, green, or hazel. There were two earrings in each of her ears. Additionally, there was evidence she may have worn glasses, despite their absence from the crime scene. Investigation Facial reconstruction of the victim, based upon morgue photographs. Over 50 people attended Johnson's funeral on October 27, 1999 after the autopsy and other examinations were completed. She was interred at Holy Family Cemetery in Caledonia, Wisconsin. Her gravestone read \\"Daughter: Jane Doe\\", along with the dates of discovery and burial, with the phrase \\"Gone, but not forgotten\\". Multiple reconstructions were created of her face to assist with visual identification of the body. In 2012, a revised reconstruction was created by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, replacing their original. Another version of this facial composite exists, which depicts a differing facial rendition of how she may have appeared in life. Police theorized that she was an international visitor, a runaway child or was estranged from her family. In 2011, investigators followed a potential lead that the victim may have been Aundria Bowman (born Alexis Badger), who disappeared from her adoptive parents' house in Hamilton, Michigan on March 11, 1989. DNA profiling, via her mother Cathy, demonstrated that they were not the same person. Additional missing persons such as Tina D'Ambrosio and Karen Wells were ruled out. Some believed that this case could be linked to the murder of Mary Kate Chamizo (n√©e Sunderlin), a previously unidentified victim who was discovered in Lake County, Illinois. Chamizo was also found malnourished, had poor dentition and had been beaten to death. Three were arrested in that case; one was convicted. All three were later cleared due to new evidence. Her remains were exhumed on October 16, 2013, for further study and transported to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where her body had previously been examined in 1999. Authorities hoped that by studying the isotopic makeup of her bones, they would be able to tell where she had lived prior to her death. An anthropologist from Tennessee was employed to conduct the tests. Although the murder remained unsolved at the time, investigators stated they hoped that the case will eventually come to a close. A press conference in 2013 explained they had uncovered more clues. It was announced on July 19, 2015, that the examination of her remains had been completed and that they would be reburied on the 16th anniversary of Johnson's discovery. Authorities stated they had indeed uncovered new leads from the exhumation, but they declined to state any details. On October 20, 2016, it was announced that chemical isotope testing performed by the Smithsonian on a sample of her hair and bone suggested she was potentially from or spent several years of her life in Alaska, Montana or portions of southern Canada. Authorities did not comment on what testing the results were from, whether recent with hair or history from bone. Additionally, it was revealed the victim or her murderer(s) were possibly from southeastern New England, such as New Hampshire and New Jersey. The police department planned on seeking forensic genetic genealogy organizations to identify potential relatives of the victim.  Identification and arrest of Linda La Roche Mugshot of Linda La Roche, taken in Lee County, Florida after her arrest. On November 7, 2019, the Racine County Sheriff's Office announced that Sheriff Christopher Schmaling would hold a media briefing the following day to release information about Racine County Jane Doe's identity and the name of the individual in custody for her death. The announcement stated that \\"both the victim and the individual in custody have substantial ties to a northwestern Chicago suburb.\\" On November 8, 2019, Racine County authorities identified the victim, through DNA comparison, as Peggy Lynn Johnson, 23, of McHenry, Illinois. Her accused killer was identified as a 63-year-old nurse, Linda Sue La Roche. La Roche owned her own nursing practice, established in 1997, which provided health care to at least two Illinois correctional facilities, without displaying any questionable or inadequate behavior. Johnson was never reported missing, although an aunt placed a personal ad in a December 1999 issue of Northwest Herald requesting Johnson contact her. La Roche was arrested on November 5, 2019, in Cape Coral, Florida, where she resided since 2013. The warrant was listed as $1 million. She reportedly confessed to killing someone during her stay in Illinois to various individuals, one of whom alerted police on September 23, 2019. According to a criminal complaint, La Roche was charged with first-degree intentional homicide and concealment of a corpse. Authorities state the maximum penalty would be life in prison. At the time she was charged with murdering Peggy Johnson, she was facing legal proceedings after causing a vehicle accident while intoxicated. Johnson was reportedly last seen by classmates at a 1994 homecoming dance in Harvard, Illinois. The victim and her accused killer first encountered each other in 1994 at a medical clinic Johnson worked at. She became homeless at age 18 after her mother's death; her brother and father had previously died. Johnson agreed to serve as a housekeeper for La Roche in exchange for room and board. The emotional and physical abuse against Johnson took place over a significant period of time before her death, presumably since moving into the residence. As indicated by the autopsy, she was subjected to a poor living environment and was not well- nourished. Instances of La Roche's abuse toward Johnson were confirmed by her children, one of which the victim confided in after being asked about a bruise to the face. Despite friends and classmates of Johnson describing her as mild- mannered and \\"quiet,\\" the suspect claimed the victim repeatedly stole from the residence, including medication, and invited males over without permission. La Roche's now-ex-husband stated he had come home in July 1999 to find Johnson lying unresponsive, which the suspect claimed resulted from an overdose. La Roche admitted to having stored medication in the cellar of their residence, where Johnson was allegedly forced to sleep, and that she witnessed seeing Johnson \\"faint\\" after emptying pill containers in their bathroom sink. Johnson allegedly expired after being taken outside for better air quality. La Roche instructed her then-husband to take their children away for an outing so she could dispose of the body. Paramedics were not called and La Roche did not provide medical assistance to the victim, despite her occupation as a nurse. The autopsy of Johnson's body disputed the alleged overdose, as toxicology tests proved negative. La Roche informed her husband upon his return that the victim regained consciousness, after which she gave two different accounts of leaving Johnson with her grandmother or abandoning her, unharmed, along a roadway in Wisconsin. Johnson's grandmother denied ever meeting members of the La Roche family, let alone seeing Johnson on the day in question. Police explained they planned to exhume Johnson's body once again, and re-inter her next to her mother in Belvidere, Illinois.

Plot The main characters in this \\"novel of fantasy\\" are eleven people who live in the same apartment building and the guest of one of them. The twelve are ordinary, middle-class people (including Protestants, Catholics, and atheists) who appear to be arrested, all at one time, by the police, and loaded onto a bus without any explanation. They drive through a mostly deserted town, seeing occasional groups of people following men with banners, while trumpet music sounds. The twelve are led to a railroad station where they get to wait in a waiting room on one of the platforms. They are entertained by a friendly waiter and informed that this is Judgment Day, and that they are held separate from the other travelers (all those who died after the year 1600) because they haven't died yet. The head waiter of the waiting room is a brutal man called Leenders, but he spends much of his time outside, while inside the waiter serves water from a pitcher which turns into wine the moment it is poured into a glass. The youngest of the company, Wim Kwets, who suffers of consumption, is reunited with his dog, which had died two years before. As the twelve discuss whether the events are real or not, whether they believe in God or not, whether they think that they will indeed be judged or not, they also begin to confess and discuss their sins. All the while souls outside are being led to the trains that will take them to the place of judgment; a special train with the Archangel Michael has already passed. One of them, a gay actor called Haack, leaves momentarily and discovers that platform 500 is filled with monsters. He is also confronted with his past‚Äîin a reenactment of the gravedigger scene from Hamlet, he is given the skull of a young actress who committed suicide because he led her to believe he loved her. When they are finally forced to leave, the monsters from 500 having been unleashed, they end up attending a grotesque parody of Christ in judgment. Leenders, now turned Satan, offers them a quick death if they will renounce God‚Äîif they deny, they are to be tortured for eternity. He explains that his armies have taken command and that everything is now Hell, God having been cast out to some remote corner of the universe. They refuse his offer, \\"whether from fear or real conviction\\", and escape. They find themselves outside, in the city, and walk home through a landscape full of signs of the apocalypse, still pondering their sins. Back at the apartment building they meet the waiter again, now clearly a Christ figure, who explains that God and existence are vast but imperfect and that humans need to accept themselves in all their imperfections. As he turns to leave he takes the dog with him, but young Wim, the dog's owner, wants to keep the animal; the waiter confers with Haack and in the end takes the dog as well as the boy with him. Reception and commentary By the time of its publication, just after World War II, Vestdijk had already acquired the status of \\"grand old man\\" of Dutch literature. A contemporary review by critic Adriaan Morri√´n noted that many of Vestdijk's readers would have been confused or disappointed by the novel, which they could have read as \\"a dream, a publicity stunt, or a tremendous joke\\". Turner Cassity, in a review of contemporary Dutch poetry published in Poetry, connects the novel to a poem of Vestdijk's, \\"The Dead Swans\\", in which dead and living swans inhabit the same pond: \\"The presentation of death as merely a form of life with its appetites darkened is chilling. It is the same fantasy which Vestdijk puts forward in his novel De kellner en de levenden\\". T. W. L. Scheltema, in a review in Books Abroad, called it a \\"well-balanced narrative\\", and said, \\"with this novel the author has achieved a place among the world's significant contemporary authors\\".

His works covered urban scenes, landscapes and figure painting and he was a founder member of the Senefelder Club. Life and work Woman's Work:On the Railway - Engine and Carriage Cleaners (c. 1917) (Art.IWM ART 161764) Hartrick was born in Bangalore, the son of an officer in the British Army. The family moved to Scotland when Hartrick was two years old. His father died shortly afterwards and in due course his mother married Charles Blatherwick, a doctor and keen amateur watercolourist who had been involved in the establishment of the Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour. After attending Fettes College, Hartrick studied medicine at Edinburgh University before studying art at the Slade School of Art in London and then at both the Academie Julian and the Atelier Cormon in Paris. Hartrick spent the summer of 1886 at Pont-Aven with Paul Gauguin. In Paris he had become friends with Vincent van Gogh and Toulouse-Lautrec and exhibited a work at the Paris Salon in 1887. Hartrick drew and painted Gauguin, van Gogh and Toulouse-Lautrec during his time in France. Hartrick returned to Scotland and for a while settled in Glasgow, where he came to know the Glasgow Boys, before he moved to London. There he began work as a book illustrator and as an illustrator with The Graphic in 1890, then with the Pall Mall Magazine in 1893. Hartrick became a prolific magazine artist and also provided illustrations for the magazine Black and White, for the Daily Chronicle, The Ludgate Monthly and Pall Mall Budget. Also in 1890, Hartrick joined the New English Art Club. From 1895 until 1907, he exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy. In 1896 he married the painter Lily Blatherwick, the daughter of Charles Blatherwick from his first marriage. The couple settled in Tresham in Gloucestershire, from where they both pursued their artistic careers; they both had works shown at the Continental Gallery in 1901. Hatrick and his wife later redecorated the small church in Tresham and she is buried in the graveyard there. Hartrick moved to London, where he taught drawing at the Camberwell School of Art from 1908 to 1914 and later at the Central School of Art, where he taught lithography until 1929. At Camberwell he taught David Jones. In 1909 Hartrick was among the founding members of the Senefelder Club and later became a Vice-President of the club. In 1910 Hartrick was elected an associate member of the Royal Watercolour Society and became a full member in 1920. Eventually Hartrick had over 200 works shown at the Royal Watercolour Society and he also exhibited at the Venice Biennale on three occasions. His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics. A series of his works showing rural characters, entitled Cotswold Types was acquired by the British Museum. During the First World War, Hartrick contributed works to the British War Memorials Committee collection of artworks. In 1917 Hartrick produced six lithographs on Women's Work for the War Propaganda Bureau's Britain's Efforts and Ideals portfolio of images which were exhibited in Britain and abroad and were also sold as prints to raise money for the war effort. During the war he also produced a series of twelve lithographs under the title London in Wartime. At the start of the Second World War, he was among the first to offer his services to the War Artists' Advisory Committee. In 1940 he was the first artist commissioned to record the work of the Women's Land Army, the same subject he had covered in World War One. Prints of his work were sold in at the National Gallery during the war and featured in the Britain at War exhibition that opened at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in May 1941. During the war, Hatrick also painted scenes near his former home at Tresham in Gloustershire for the Recording Britain scheme. The Arts Council organized a memorial exhibition for Hartrick in 1951.

It was founded by S. Anand and D. Ravikumar in 2003. The first book it published was Ambedkar: Autobiographical Notes priced at Rs 40 (about $1 at that time). Since then it has published acclaimed fiction, non-fiction, graphic novels and poetry anthologies. From 2009 onwards, Navayana broadened its publishing outlook to include social issues other than caste because ‚Äòthe struggle against caste cannot happen in isolation from other struggles for justice and equality‚Äô as a statement on the website reads.http://navayana.org In Pali, the word \\"navayana\\" means \\"new vehicle\\". B. R. Ambedkar used the word in 1956 to describe the branch of Buddhism that wouldn't be mired in the Hinayana- Mahayana divide, but would help dalits gain equality in India.http://www.firstpost.com/living/im-an-anti-caste-junkie-meet-s-anand- the-man-behind-navayana-publishing-house-737357.html  The Navayana logo  The logo of the publishing house is an ink sketch of two buffaloes kissing. The publisher S. Anand explains that the iconography comes from an excerpt from Aravind Malagatti‚Äôs autobiography in Kannada, Government Brahmana. It is a story about how the ideology of caste does not allow a dalit-owned she- buffalo in heat to mate with a he-buffalo owned by a landlord. For the cover art of the April 2003 issue of The Dalit, a journal run by the Dalit Media Network, Chennai, Anand approached the artist Chandru (G. Chandrasekaran) with this story. The logo is a close-up of the artist‚Äôs interpretation.  Founders  = S. Anand = Anand has worked as a journalist with Deccan Chronicle, Indian Express, The Hindu and Outlook. At the time of the launch of Navayana, he was working for Outlook in Chennai. In 2007, he left his day job as a journalist and turned full-time to publishing. Today, he is the publisher of Navayana Publishing Pvt Ltd based in New Delhi. = D. Ravikumar = Ravikumar is an activist in the civil rights movement in Tamil Nadu. At the time of the launch of Navayana, he was a bank employee. In 2006, he turned full-time to politics and became a member of the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi, and was elected to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly.  Annual Lectures  Navayana hosted its first annual lecture where the Slovenian Marxist philosopher, Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek, spoke in New Delhi, Kochi and Hyderabad to packed audiences. = 2011 = The American feminist thinker and former Black Panther, Angela Yvonne Davis, delivered lectures in New Delhi and Pune. = 2015 = The aboriginal writer from Australia, Ali Cobby Eckermann, delivered the lectures in New Delhi and in Kolkata.  Controversies  After the release of \\"The Doctor and The Saint\\" by Navayana, several anti-caste activists rejected her introduction to the book. They argued that Arundhati Roy had misrepresented Ambedkar's views on eugenics, tribal issues, capitalism, among other issues, for marketing purposes. At the time, Dalit Camera released interviews on their YouTube channel and an open letter to Arundhati Roy, clarifying rumours that threats from Dalit activists had been the reason for the stalling of a book launch in Hyderabad. In the letter, they make it clear that activists had only been prepared with several questions for Roy, and also attach the list of questions for her. Both the letter by Dalit Camera and Roy's response have been published in Hatred in the Belly. In 2014, Ambedkar Age Collective (published by The Shared Mirror publishing house) released the book Hatred In The Belly critiquing the introduction to \\"The Doctor and the Saint\\" by Arundhati Roy. The title of the book is from a Telugu phrase that the poet Joopaku Subhadra uses in his essay, \\"Ka dapulo kasi\\". In this collection of essays & speeches by various Dalit activists and scholars, the authors write a scathing critique of how the introduction does not do justice to the seminal book that is Annihilation of Caste. Ambedkar Age Collective writes about the book that it will \\"unfurl before you a critical tapestry dissecting the hegemonic brahminic discourse which works towards delegitimizing the radical legacy of Ambedkarite thought\\". The larger criticism against the book and Navayana was that they did not consult experts of anti-caste narratives in writing the introduction to Annihilation of Caste, and questioned Roy's claim to expertise on the matter. The various authors included in the book are: Bojja Tharakam, Adv. Dr. Suresh Mane, Anoop Kumar, U. Sambashiva Rao, Sunny Kapicadu, K. K. Baburaj, Joopaka Subhadra, Dr. K.

Early life Born in Abingdon-on- Thames in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), Fuller went to London at age 14, as apprentice to a writing master. He went into business on his own, in that trade, in Fenchurch Street; and then set up a writing school in Lothbury. He had his son trained in accounts, and placed in a bank; he then joined his son in banking. Banker The London bank William Fuller & Son was founded \\"at the sign of the Artichoke\\", later 24 Lombard Street, around 1769. At the end of the century the firm's style was Fuller & Chatteris. It eventually failed in 1841, when it was known as Whitmore, Wells and Whitmore.Frederick George Hilton Price, A Handbook of London Bankers, with some account of their predecessors the early goldsmiths (1890), p. 176; archive.org. Religious views and charitable activities Fuller was in the congregation of Samuel Pike, who became a Sandemanian. Fuller, however, opposed the influence of Robert Sandeman, and campaigned against it, in a 1759 pamphlet Reflections on an Epistolary Correspondence between S.P. and R.S.. Controversy ensued, but Pike was expelled by his congregation. By the end of his life, Fuller was considered a rigid Calvinist. Fuller donated an estimated ¬£60,000 to numerous causes, over the course of his life, in particular giving support to nonconformism.Wales and the Congregational Fund Board: \\"A beauty-spot of ecclesiastical history\\", Transactions of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion (1978), p. 164 He was involved in the King's Head Society, and by eight annual major donations sustained the Congregational Fund Board.The Congregational Fund Board 1695-1995: Can these bones live?, Y Cofiadur - Rhif 59a (1995), p. 18.

Fuller founded six almshouses in Hoxton in 1794, and six more just before his death. Family and legacy Fuller married Bethia Wellingham from St Paul's Walden in 1734, before his move to Lothbury. At his death in March 1800, he left ¬£600,000. His son Thomas had died a bachelor in 1796 and his youngest daughter Esther, wife of Joshua Ellis, in January 1800. In 1803 his second daughter Mary died, followed by the eldest Sarah in 1810, neither having married. His whole fortune then passed to his only grandchild Bethia Ellis (1781‚Äì1865), who in December 1800 had married Ebenezer Maitland.historyofparliamentonline.org, Fuller Maitland (formerly Maitland), Ebenezer (1780-1858), of Park Place; Shinfield Park, Berks.; Stansted Mountfitchet, Essex and 11 Bryanston Square, Mdx.

Raised after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, on 1 September 1966, as the 65th Cavalry, its designation was changed to 65th Armoured Regiment in August 1967. The first CO was Lt Col K.K. Kaul. Initially equipped with Sherman Mk IV and Mk V tanks, it was later equipped with Vijayantas. The President of India Late Shri Fakhru-ud-din Ali Ahmed presented a guidon to the regiment on 11 November 1976. Operations The regiment was part of 1st Armoured Division during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 and was located in the general area of Muktesar and Malaut but did not see any action. 65th Armoured Regiment was one of the first regiments in the Army to be equipped with T-72 tanks. Along-with its new tanks, it proceeded to Sri Lanka during Operation Pawan. It was one of the first units to reach Sri Lanka, arriving in Jaffna in October 1987, and was amongst the last to de-induct, returning to India in March 1990. The regiment performed a wide variety of roles including clearing road-blocks, keeping railways and roads open, ambushes and raids. The regiment lost an officer, one JCO and 15 soldiers killed, and nine soldiers wounded. A troop of tanks of \\"A\\" Squadron of the Regiment was the first to be airlifted to Jaffna and they participated in the battle of the Jaffna University along with 72 & 115 Infantry Brigades under 54 Infantry Division. This action culminated in the subsequent relief of Jaffna Fort. The troop eas later augmented by the complete squadron. It was during this action that the Regiment earned its first gallantry awards in combat, One VrC and One SM (Posthumous) It has since actively participated in OP Rakshak II (J&K; CI Ops (1996) as also in OP PARAKRAM (2002). Reconnaissance squadron On 1 April 1970, 93rd (Independent) Reconnaissance Squadron was raised with AMX-13 tanks and was placed n the order of battle of 1st Armoured Division during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971. The Squadron saw action in the Punjab theatre during the 1971 Indo-Pak war. Subsequently, it was located in Malerkotla and re-equipped with the Vijyanta tanks. In 1979, this squadron along-with two others, 90th & 92nd of the Poona Horse & 18th Cavalry respectively, was merged to form 90 Armoured Regiment. Cap badge The cap badge at the time of raising was the generic Armoured Corps badge and shoulder title comprised the letters \\"65C\\" in brass. The regiment was in the process of designing a badge which comprised crossed lances with pennons, and the numerals \\"65\\" at the crossing, with the regimental motto on a scroll along the base of the lances. It was the first-ever armoured regiment of Indian origin to adopt the scarlet backing of the cap badge and scarlet shoulder flashes. Also, it was the first unit where NCO's sported scarlet chevrons of rank against the traditional white. Just then, an order was issued by Army Headquarters that all newly raised regiments would no longer use the terms \\"Cavalry\\" or \\"Lancers\\", but instead be called \\"Armoured Regiments\\". The 65th was the first to take up the new designation. Accordingly, the cap badge was amended to include a small scroll below the numbers with the script \\"ARMD REGT\\" inscribed, which was barely visible. The more visible lower scroll carries the regimental motto, \\"Maan Ya Mrityu\\".

He was blacklisted in the 1950s, and was indicted for contempt of Congress but subsequently acquitted. Early life and career Tyne, born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, began his acting career under the name Buddy Yarus. He used that name when appearing in the 1945 war film Objective Burma!, and in the Laurel and Hardy film The Dancing Masters (1943). As \\"George Tyne\\" he appeared in A Walk in the Sun, Sands of Iwo Jima and Thieves Highway. Tyne also appeared on Broadway in a number of roles, including the hit 1954 play Lunatics and Lovers. Congressional testimony and prosecution Tyne was blacklisted from the movies in 1951 and from television in 1952, after his name was publicized in congressional committee hearings into alleged Communist infiltration of the entertainment industry. In August 1955, the House Un- American Activities Committee held hearings in New York City to probe alleged Communist infiltration of Broadway, radio and television. Tyne was one of seven witnesses who refused to answer questions about whether they had been members of the Communist Party. Six cited their right to avoid self- incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, but Tyne simply refused to answer. In his testimony, Tyne called actor Lee J. Cobb a \\"stool pigeon\\" for naming him as part of a \\"Communist group\\" in Hollywood in 1943. Tyne refused to say whether he knew Cobb, and said, \\"I think the privilege offered by the fifth amendment is wonderful for those who wish to take advantage of it, but I'm not standing on it.\\" Tyne refused to identify a Communist Party card, shown to him by the committee counsel, which was made out to \\"Buddy\\" Yarus. Tyne said, \\"All these questions are an invasion of any personal and private ideas and associations.\\" In July 1956, Tyne was one of seven witnesses, including playwright Arthur Miller, who were cited for contempt of Congress of Congress by the House of Representatives. The other six included stage actress Sarah Cunninghan, her husband John Randolph, and actors Lou Polan and Stanley Prager. In March 1957, Tyne was one of three entertainers who were indicted by a federal grand jury in New York for refusing to answer HUAC questions during its August 1955 hearings. The others were Pete Seeger and Elliot Sullivan. All were charged with contempt of Congress. Tyne was acquitted in 1961 on technical grounds. Later life and career Prior to his blacklisting, Tyne's last movie role was in the 1951 war film Decision Before Dawn. During the period of his blacklisting he worked mainly as a stage actor. He appeared in supporting roles in the 1954 off- Broadway revival of Threepenny Opera, the 1954 comedy Lunatics and Lovers, and Romanoff and Juliet (1957). In the 1960s, Tyne began appearing in small roles on television and in the movies. He also began work as a television director. Tyne directed episodes of The Love Boat, The Paul Lynde Show, M*A*S*H* and the 1979 TV series Friends. He returned to acting, in small roles, in TV shows and movies in the 1960s. His last film role was a bit part in the 1984 film, The Lonely Guy. In the early 1990s, he taught directing courses at the California Institute of the Arts.

History Under the Naval Defence Act 1889, HMS Latona was laid down on 22 August 1889. Built by Vickers at their Naval Construction Yard, Barrow-in-Furness Latona was launched on 22 May 1890 and completed in April 1891. Latona was present at the Naval Review at Spithead on 26 June 1897 in celebration of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. She served in the West Indies under Captain Baynes, and returned to Portsmouth from Bermuda on 27 January 1900, with the paid-off crew of HMS Indefatigable. During the tour she had encountered the barque Oxford in distress, and brought the crew of 16 to safety as the ship was leaking. She paid off at Portsmouth on 8 February 1900. On 27 June 1900 Latona was ordered to be specially commissioned for a naval mobilization, to take place in July. In August 1902 Latona was refit to become depot (supply) ship for submarines at Portsmouth, with the crew of the boats living on board her, and she was commissioned as such on 14 October 1902 by Captain Reginald Bacon, the Inspecting Captain of Submarines. She was recommissioned at Chatham on 1 June 1908, then converted to minelayer in 1910. In mid-1913, Latona was active with the Minelayer Squadron of the Second Fleet.The Navy List (July, 1913), p. 338. Between 1‚Äì7 January 1916 she laid mines between Cape Alanguli and Apostula Island. Between 13‚Äì14 December 1916 officers from ship were involved in an incident with aircraft coming from Kum- Kale. HMS Latona was paid off on 23 December 1918 at Malta. In 1919 HMS Latona was placed on harbour duties. She was sold on 22 December 1920.

The most important stop along the way is Salzwedel. History Renovated Salzwedel station Uelzen station in Uelzen The Stendal‚ÄìUelzen line was originally opened in 1873 as part of a direct connection from Berlin to the naval base at Wilhelmshaven by the Magdeburg‚ÄìHalberstadt Railway Company (MHE) and was opened as part of the so-called America Line. In 1945, the line was cut by the Inner German border. West of the border a temporary terminus was created at Nienbergen as the former station in the Lower Saxon town of Bergen an der Dumme was 1,200 meters east of the Iron Curtain. The second track was removed in two phases in 1946 and the 1980s: first, the section from Wieren to Nienbergen was singled, then the second track was also removed between Wieren and Uelzen. In the Soviet Zone, which became East Germany in 1949, trains initially ran between Stendal and Bergen. Border security measures were imposed between Salzwedel and Bergen on 7 October 1951 as Bergen station was only 1,200 meters from the border. Between Stendal and Salzwedel one of the two tracks was dismantled because the track material was supposedly needed for the construction of the Berlin outer ring. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1990, the rebuilding of the Stendal‚ÄìSalzwedel‚ÄìUelzen connection was added to the list of German Unity Transport Projects (Verkehrsprojekte Deutsche Einheit). The old line was completely rebuilt and established in 1999 as a single-track, electrified mainline railway and restored to operation. Part of the second track was also restored. The whole project took several years to complete. The 17.5 km long section between Brunau and district road 1005 in Klein Gartz now has two tracks and there is also an approximately one kilometre long passing loop west of the former Kl√§den station; the current Kl√§den station is now located further to the east on a single-track section. In addition, during the implementation of the German Unity Transport Project, all loading sidings near the line were dismantled and connecting sidings were reduced so that local freight movements are no longer possible on this line. The originally planned complete reconstruction of the line as a two-track line has not yet been realised. (brochure) Current situation In the 2010/11 timetable, the Regional-Express service RE 20 runs between Uelzen and Stendal every two hours and the Regionalbahn service RB 32 runs every two hours between Salzwedel and Stendal. Both services are operated by DB Regio. The RE services are operated with double-deck coaches mostly hauled by class 114 locomotives and the RB services are partly operated with class 425 EMUs. On Friday, an Intercity service is operated from Hamburg via L√ºneburg, Uelzen and Stendal to Berlin, returning on Sunday. Until 13 December 2014, a train pair operated daily as a EuroCity on the Hamburg‚ÄìBerlin‚ÄìWroc≈Çaw route. Since April 2014, an InterRegio-Express has been operating the route from Berlin and Hamburg. During disruptions to long-distance traffic between Hamburg and Berlin services often also detour over the line via Wittenberg. As part of a program to upgrade links between seaports and the hinterland, a second track was built from December 2012 to November 2013 in the Uelzen district of Veer√üen to the east of the Stendal‚ÄìUelzen line, so that traffic coming from the direction of Stendal could run to the north without crossing the Hanover‚ÄìHamburg line. Future  The existing two-track section for crossing and overhauling between Brunau-Packebusch and Rademin, which is around 17.5 kilometre long, is to be extended to the east and west. This applies to the sections between Hohenwulsch and Brunaupark-Packebusch and between Rademin and Salzwedel. This involves a total of 22 km of additional second track at an estimated cost of about ‚Ç¨57 million. The reason given for the project is to increase the capacity for freight and to improve the performance of regional traffic. In July 2013, Deutsche Bahn put the project out to tender. The estimated value of the contract, including overhead electrification, is ‚Ç¨22 million, which is to be carried out between June 2014 and March 2016.

The anchor stores are JCPenney and C-A-L Ranch. There is 1 vacant anchor store that was once Herberger's. The mall is owned by Namdar Realty Group.  History  The mall was in planning as early as 1972, when the Logan City Commission refused to rezone land for the mall, leading to the developers bringing a lawsuit against the commission. Plans re-emerged in 1974, with developers John Price Associates announcing it as a 300,000 square foot mall to include 3 department store anchors, a supermarket, a bank, and \\"dozens\\" of small businesses, with an opening date sometime in 1976. Construction had begun by 1975, with anchors JCPenney, ZCMI, and Ernst-Malmo (later specified as Ernst Home Center) announced at this time. An opening of late July 1976 was announced by February that year, with additional tenants including Logan Savings and Loan, Karmelkorn, Kinney Shoes, and J.B.'s Big Boy. A 14-year-old girl was shot in the chest on the mall property on July 19, 1976, before recovering. The Ernst Home Center opened for business before the mall on July 20, 1976. The mall proper opened on July 29, 1976, with anchors Ernst Home Center (37,000 sq ft), ZCMI (61,000 sq ft), and JCPenney (47,000 sq ft) along with a supermarket, a drug store, a First Security Bank, and an outparcel 3-screen Mann Theatre. In 1988, the Bon Marche (formerly Ernst Home Center) at the mall was bought by and converted to Lamonts. The Cache Valley 3 Theatre was converted to a Carmike Cinemas in 1995. ZCMI was sold to The May Department Stores Company in 1999, with the store at the mall being sold to Dillard's in 2001. Lamonts closed in 2000, and later became a Dillard's Home Store. The Cache Valley 3 Theatre was converted to its final operator, Westates Theatres, in February 2002, before closing on October 18, 2007. In January 2013 it was announced that both Dillard's locations would close, citing under-performance. Herberger's opened at the mall in early 2014, their first location in Utah, in the former Dillard's space. C-A-L Ranch opened at the mall in the former Dillard's Home Store space in 2015. The mall was sold from Rouse Properties to Namdar Realty Group in December 2017. Herberger's closed at the mall in 2018, in a round of 42 store closures prior to bankruptcy later that year. In 2019, the former Cache Valley Mall 3 Theatres building underwent heavy renovations to become two restaurants and an event center, with a projected opening date of Spring 2020. On June 4, 2020, JCPenney announced that it would be closing in October 2020 as part of a plan to close 154 stores nationwide which will leave C-A-L Ranch as the only anchor left.

Politics Balwantrao never intended to be solely a lawyer, and hence he entered the Indian independence movement and became active in politics. He imbibed the aspiration of freedom in the minds of the people and awoke them to fight against the British raj. He accepted the leadership of Lokmanya Balgangadhar Tilak and admired him to be his political leader and guru. He always called Lokmanya Tilak as Bhagawan Tilak. He propagated the ideology of Lokmanya Tilak and called on the people to accept his principles of Swadeshi, Bycot, Swarajya and National Education.

In the year 1917, Dr. Annie Besant started the Home Rule League Movement in India. Balwantrao actively supported this movement and propagated the ideology of this movement in Chandrapur and Vidharbha. After the sad demise of Lokmanya Tilak, Mahatma Gandhi took the political charge of the freedom movement and unanimously decided to launch the Non - cooperative movement in India against British rule. Balwantrao Deshmukh supported the same and along with some other lawyers of Chandrapur, boycotted the Court for about 1 year. In the Year 1919-20 Balwantrao was Unanimously selected as president C.P. and Berar Congress Committee. During his tenure he held four sessions of providential committee at distinct places.

In July 2019, Brookfield sold the mall to Arizona-based Three Rivers Village, LLC. The mall has three anchors: JCPenney, Sportsman's Warehouse, and Regal Cinemas. Its original main anchors were The Bon Marche (which became Macy's; closed 2017), JCPenney, Sears (closed 2013), and Emporium (closed 2001). The Kelso Public Library moved its main branch to the mall in 2011. The mall also has several freestanding businesses: Safeway (originally TOP Food & Drug), Target (opened 1990), and Pier 1 Imports. There are also several freestanding restaurants: Red Lobster, Izzy's Pizza, Panera Bread, and Fiesta Bonita Mexican Restaurant. Regal Cinemas operated a freestanding theater until January 2015, when it relocated into the main mall. History While the mall opened to great fanfare in 1987, bringing a variety of new stores to the area, as well as the relocation of Sears, JCPenney, and The Bon Marche from nearby downtown Longview, Washington, the mall began to struggle in the early 2000s, starting with the closure of the Emporium chain. A few tenants, such as a used car showroom, a seasonal Halloween store, and a church, occupied the former Emporium for brief periods of time until 2014. The decline in foot traffic prompted many smaller retailers to close, and some chains present in the mall such as Radio Shack, Sam Goody, and KB Toys, were also closed as those chains struggled. The food court also dwindled down to a couple of local tenants. Sears announced late in 2012 that they would close their store in the mall in January 2013, which further reduced foot traffic. Among the businesses that left after Sears closed were Big 5 Sporting Goods, Fred Meyer Jewelers, and Mr. Formal. Chuck E. Cheese's also closed their location inside the mall on April 7, 2014. Macy's announced in January 2017 that the Kelso location is one of 68 stores that would be closing. The store closed in March 2017. As of February 2018, there were no tenants open in the food court, and the food court remained vacant until March 2020. Sportsman's Warehouse opened in the former Emporium store in July 2014. The former Sears store has been demolished, and Regal Cinemas has constructed a new theater on the former Sears site, which replaced the mall's freestanding theater, as well as the Triangle Cinemas in nearby Longview. The new theater opened in January 2015. The mall's management announced in September 2014 that Planet Fitness will be moving into the former Chuck E. Cheese's site with additional space. Planet Fitness held its grand opening in January 2015. Panera Bread built a new, freestanding location which opened in December 2017. A local business called The Coffee Court opened in the mall's food court in March 2020. This is the first food court tenant in over two years. In popular culture An episode of the Food Network show Food Court Wars was filmed in the mall. The episode titled \\"Gaufre Gourmet vs. Pressed\\" originally aired on March 30, 2014. The winner of the contest received one year of free rent in the food court, and Gaufre Gourmet opened for business in April 2014. However, citing a lack of foot traffic, Gaufre Gourmet closed in September 2014, and the owners have since opened a restaurant in Portland, Oregon.

He served under Napoleon and under the Bourbon Restoration. In 1830 he was briefly Minister of Public Works on the eve of the July Revolution. Early years Guillaume-Antoine-Beno√Æt Capelle was born on 9 September 1775 in Salles-Curan, then in Rouergue and today in Aveyron, to a family of judges. From his youth he was an enthusiastic supporter of the French Revolution. At the age of 15 he represented the district of Millau in the 14 July 1790 F√™te de la F√©d√©ration. At the age of 18 he was appointed a lieutenant in the 2nd grenadier battalion of the Pyr√©n√©es- Orientales. He served in that grade until 1794, when he was dismissed as a federalist and returned to Millau. Capelle was briefly an itinerant actor, before marrying and becoming the commander of the National Guard of Millau. After the coup of 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799) he was sent as a delegate to Paris by his fellow citizens to congratulate the consular government. With the sponsorship of Jean-Antoine Chaptal he entered the Ministry of Interior in 1800. First Empire  Capelle was appointed Secretary General of the department of Alpes-Maritimes at the end of 1800, then of the Department of Stura in 1805. On 25 February 1808 he was appointed prefect of the department of the Mediterranean with its capital in Livorno. This was a difficult position. The prefecture bordered the states of the Elisa Bonaparte, the Princess of Lucca and Piombino, who was extremely jealous of his authority. Capelle was able to obtain the favor of the princess, and the most perfect understanding existed between them. This intimacy with his sister displeased the Emperor, who moved Capelle to the position of prefect of Geneva on 30 November 1810. Capelle did not find it easy to get the citizens to accept him. Allied troops arrived at the undefended city of Geneva at the end of 1813 and forced it to surrender. Napoleon had Capelle thrown in prison despite his being exonerated by a commission of inquiry. Bourbon Restoration After the first Bourbon Restoration, on 10 June 1814 Capelle accepted the position of Prefect of Ain from King Louis XVIII. The Count of Artois gave him the Officer's Cross of the Legion of Honor. When Napoleon returned, Capelle went to Ghent during the Hundred Days. He returned to France with the second Restoration. He was made prefect of Doubs, and soon after was appointed councilor of state. In 1822 he was made Secretary General of the Ministry of the Interior. In 1828 he was appointed prefect of Seine-et-Oise. On 19 May 1830 Capelle joined the Ministry of Jules de Polignac as head of the newly created Ministry of Public Works. His first task was to prepare for new elections after the 16 May 1830 dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies. On 25 July 1830 Capelle signed the reactionary July Ordinances. Three days later, when the July Revolution broke out, he fled with his colleagues and took refuge in England. He was tried in absentia before the Court of Peers and sentenced to life imprisonment, confiscation of property and the loss of all his titles. In 1836 Capelle received a Royal pardon and returned to France where he lived in retirement. He died on 25 October 1843 in Montpellier, H√©rault.

Overview GenePeeks simulates the combination of genetic sequences of two people and predicts potential diseases and inherited disorders to find good recipient matches for sperm donors. By simulating the process of reproduction with the two DNA sequences, the company's software (called Matchright) forms a hypothetical child genome to determine the likelihood of the resulting child developing one of around 600 conditions. The technology is currently aimed at sperm banks; the first users will be at two fertility clinics in the United States, one of which is Manhattan Cryobank in New York City. The software creates around 10,000 virtual genomes for each donor-recipient pair, and typically rules out 10-15% of donors as bad matches for the recipient. Currently it only searches for single gene genetic conditions, but the company plan to expand the software to look for multiple gene diseases like diabetes and heart disease. Concern has been raised as to whether the software would allow \\"designer babies\\", but the company say that they are not intending to use the system for non-medical purposes. History GenePeeks was established by Anne Morriss and Lee Silver. Silver is a genetics professor at Princeton University whose work is focused on reproduction and development. Morriss was motivated to start the service in part by her own experience of starting a family; her son received an inherited disorder (MCADD) after being conceived with sperm from a donor. The two started GenePeeks after being introduced by a mutual friend. In January 2014 the company was issued a patent for their algorithms to simulate genetic interactions. In 2018, Anne Morriss had left the company and the company website has since been taken down.

Orbital and rotational energy are dissipated as heat in the crust of the moon. Io has a similar mass and size as the Moon, but Io is the most geologically active body in the Solar System. This is caused by the heating mechanism of Io. The major heating source of Earth and its moon is radioactive heating, but the heating source on Io is tidal heating. As Jupiter is very massive, the side of Io nearest to Jupiter has a slightly larger gravitational pull than the opposite side. This difference in gravitational forces cause distortion of Io‚Äôs shape. Differently from the Earth‚Äôs only moon, Jupiter has two other large moons (Europa and Ganymede) that are in an orbital resonance with it. Io is the innermost of this set of resonant moons, and their interactions maintain its orbit in an eccentric (elliptical) state. The varying distance between Jupiter and Io continually changes the degree of distortion of Io's shape and flexes its interior, frictionally heating it. The friction-induced heating drives strong volcanic activities on the surface of Io. Although there is general agreement that the cause of the heat as manifested in Io's many volcanoes is tidal heating from the pull of gravity from Jupiter and its moon Europa, the volcanoes are not in the positions predicted with tidal heating. They are shifted 30 to 60 degrees to the East.http://spaceref.com/jupiter/underground-magma-ocean-could-explain-ios- misplaced-volcanoes.html A study published in 2015, explains the eastern shift by an ocean of molten rock under the surface. The movement of this magma would generate extra heat. Liquids, especially if they are sticky (or viscous), can produce heat through friction. The team who wrote the paper believe that the subsurface ocean is a mixture of molten and solid rock. When the molten rock flows, it may swirl and rub against the surrounding rock, thus generating heat.Tyler, R. W. Henning C. Hamilton. 2015. TIDAL HEATING IN A MAGMA OCEAN WITHIN JUPITER'S MOON Io. The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series Other moons in the Solar System undergo tidal heating, and they too may have more heat generated by this process, including heat from the movement of water. This ability to generate heat in a subsurface ocean increases the chance of life on bodies like Europa and Enceladus.http://www.space.com/30530-jupiter- moon-io-magma-volcano-mystery.htmlhttp://astrobiology.com/2015/09/cassini- finds-global-ocean-in-saturns-moon- enceladus.htmlhttps://blu181.mail.live.com/?tid=cm6cO1qwVc5RGKGgAjfeSbng2&fid;=flinbox  References   External links  * Tidal Heating tutorial Io (moon) ","title":"Tidal heating of Io"},{"id":"42508262","text":"Salvatore Gaffiero (8 March 1828 - 8 December 1906) was a Maltese prelate who served as Auxiliary Bishop of Malta from 1899 until his death in 1906.

He was born in Chicago, Illinois and spent most of his life in the city. Originally a lawyer, DeWolf founded a successful real estate company in 1894. In 1901, he was named the president of the Kellogg Switchboard & Supply Company. His seven-year tenure featured a stock controversy that reached the Illinois Supreme Court and a large strike. DeWolf was passionate about the arts, amassing a collection of Anders Zorn works that he donated to the Art Institute of Chicago. DeWolf was an etcher himself, and some of his works were showcased at the Art Institute. A room there was named the DeWolf Gallery of American Landscapes in his honor. DeWolf was also a trustee at the Pasadena Art Institute. Biography Among the Redwoods, an oil painting by DeWolf in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago. Wallace Leroy DeWolf was born on February 24, 1854 in Chicago, Illinois. He was the son of Calvin DeWolf, a prominent lawyer and secretary of the Illinois chapter of the American Anti- Slavery Society. Wallace DeWolf attended Union College of Law at the University of Chicago, graduating with a Bachelor of Laws in 1876. He was admitted to the bar by the Supreme Court of Illinois. DeWolf opened a law office with his father in Chicago. DeWolf married Mary R. Huntington in Stuttgart, Germany in 1890. Her father was a clerk for the Supreme Court of the United States in Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1894, DeWolf founded W. L. DeWolf & Co., specializing in real estate. The company focused on warehousing and manufacturing. In 1901, DeWolf was named the president of the Kellogg Switchboard & Supply Company, succeeding his brother-in-law Milo G. Kellogg. DeWolf's tenure at Kellogg was marred by controversy. He secretly attempted to sell company stock to Western Electric, a competing telecommunications company. Milo Kellogg, who had left the company due to his failing health, sued to stop the sale of his stock. The Supreme Court of Illinois sided with Kellogg in Brown v. Cragg and Dunbar v. American Telephone and Telegraph. DeWolf maintained the presidency, however. In 1903, the company became embroiled in a labor dispute, leading to a strike by the Brass Molder's Union Local 83 and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. DeWolf ended the strike by firing ninety percent of the company workforce. Howard Van Doren Shaw designed a house for DeWolf in Lake Forest, Illinois in 1904, completed a year later. DeWolf maintained the presidency at the company until 1908. Art was a lifelong passion for DeWolf. His etching and painting works were exhibited at art galleries, including the Art Institute of Chicago. Chicago mayor Carter Harrison, Jr. named DeWolf to the Commission for Encouragement of Local Art. In 1913, DeWolf donated a collection of 143 etchings by Anders Zorn to the Art Institute. He was the subject of a September 1919 article in the Fine Arts Journal. Thanks to his donations, the Art Institute named one of its rooms the DeWolf Gallery of American Landscapes. DeWolf was a member of the Chicago Society of Etchers and Art Institute of Chicago, and was a trustee of the Pasadena Art Institute in Pasadena, California. He was also the director of the Illinois chapter of the National Audubon Society, vice president of the Union League Club of Chicago, and was a member of the Chicago Historical Society.

Horses are asked to navigate an obstacle course with guidance from a human handler on the ground. At lower levels, the horse may be guided with a lead rope but at higher levels the horse works without a lead and in some cases, without a halter. There also are competition levels where horses compete in the \\"wild\\" ‚Äî outside of an enclosed arena, and competitions where horses are not judged live but rather via video sent in by their handlers. Any equine of any size may compete in agility, including miniature horses, donkeys, mules and draft horses. In live competition, handlers are required to wear an equestrian helmet and cannot use whips or sticks. The horse is only allowed, at most, to wear a halter, lead rope and may wear leg protection such as splint boots. The lead rope must be loose and the handler cannot pull on it but must remain within a designated position with their horse. Competition usually consists of a course of eight or more obstacles. Examples of obstacles may include tunnels, jumps, a seesaw, passing through a curtain, weaving between poles or cones, passing through or over poles, branches, gates, hoops, water, or tarps; entering a trailer; rolling a ball, backing between two poles, stepping onto an object, standing still, carrying a light load, crossing a bridge, navigating a small maze or labyrinth, crossing over an A-frame, and so on.

Ryder defeated The Haas Brothers (Charlie and Russ Haas) at JAPW's \\"Night Of The Barbwire 2\\" in Newark, New Jersey. On May 8, Yar lost to Rik Ratchet (with Donnie B. and The Master) for an NWA New Jersey show in Blackwood, New Jersey; his opponent used brass knuckles to score a pinfall. On May 20, 1998, in one of their last JAPW appearances, Wolf and Yar wrestled The Skyscrapers (Mega and Slugger) to a double-countout in Bayonne, New Jersey. Three days later, The Lost Boys and Karetaker lost a 6-man tag team match to Bad Attitude I, Lord Zieg, and Bobby Blake for a World Wrestling Stars Alliance show in Bordentown, New Jersey.DiMuzio, Michael J. \\"Arena Reports: New Jersey - World Wrestling Stars Alliance at the Derby Fire House.\\" Pro Wrestling Illustrated.

On July 19, 2008, Wolf defeated Das Ubermachin #1 via disqualification at the DWF's \\"Stars Stripes & Wrestle IV\\". His former tag team partner Yar unexpectedly came out at the end of the bout and together they challenged Das Ubermachin in a match for the DWF Tag Team Championship, which they won later that night. The Lost Boys made their first title defense against KJ Hellfire and Rockin' Rebel at Pro Wrestling Unplugged's \\"Family Reunion\\" a week later. Wolf and Yar won the match when their opponents were disqualified for using fireballs. That summer, Devastation Wrestling Federation merged with American Wrestlers Fund Raisers, Loco Wrestling and Pro Wrestling Unplugged to form a \\"pro wrestling conglomerate\\" known as WrestleReality. The group signed a national syndication deal via internet television website TVByDemand.com, the parent company running Loco Wrestling, which was to begin airing shows in 85 cities later that year. On August 9, The Lost Boys wrestled on Loco Wrestling's first-ever show, \\"Loco Invasion\\", against AWFR Tag Team Champions X'ed (Warlock and Slayer) in an impromptu title bout. Outside interference from The Latin Connection (Downtown Raphael, El Monstro and D-Crazed) near the end of the match initially saw The Lost Boys awarded the AWFR titles. The decision was quickly reversed, however, on the orders of DC Lurie and the team was forced to return the belts. The Lost Boys, accompanied by Doc Diamond, faced The Latin Connection (D'crazed and Monstro) weeks later at WrestleReality's Clementon Amusement Park show where they fought to a double-disqualification. A rematch was held at The Flyers Skate Zone in Voorhees, New Jersey on September 27, 2008.

He spent 16 years in prison for the murder of his third wife Annette. His crime was dramatized in the TV movie Bloodlines, with Bouwer being portrayed by Mark Mitchinson. His son from a previous marriage was also convicted of an unrelated murder in 2003. His first wife was also convicted of helping their son cover up his crime. Early life Bouwer was born in 1950. He married his third wife Annette in 1981 and migrated to New Zealand with her and their children in 1997. He left South Africa shortly after being declared an \\"impaired\\" doctor by the South African Health Professions Council due to a pethidine addiction. He claimed he was a member of the African National Congress (ANC) and had been imprisoned for resisting apartheid, though these claims were later revealed to be untrue. After moving to New Zealand, he became the head of psychological medicine at Dunedin Hospital. Murder Bouwer drugged his wife to simulate the symptoms of a tumour. He used a combination of sedatives and hypoglycaemia-inducing drugs obtained with forged prescriptions. Annette was subjected to months of medical tests, including an operation. She was declared dead on 5 January 2000. Police investigation Dr. Andrew Bowers, who had treated Annette, refused to sign her death certificate without a post-mortem. Bouwer objected to a post-mortem but was overruled. He claimed that his wife was Jewish and therefore had to be buried within 48 hours of dying, but her funeral was conducted in an Anglican church. The Vicar was puzzled by Bouwer's behaviour and stated that the house seemed to have been disinfected. Significant levels of sedatives and insulin were found in her blood, and a further investigation showed they had been obtained via 11 forged prescriptions. Bouwer claimed he was suffering from cancer and depression and had obtained the drugs to commit suicide. The police found a string of email inquiries he had sent to hypoglycaemia experts, claiming he was a forensic psychiatrist. In particular he asked how likely an insulin injection was to be determined as the cause of death. The police established that Bouwer was having a relationship with Dr. Anne Walshe. Within weeks of their relationship beginning, he began obtaining the forged prescriptions. Walshe was not suspected of being involved in (or even being aware of) Bouwer's activities. Walshe claims she did not sleep with Bouwer until after Annette died, and believes he is innocent, stating, \\"He did not murder his wife and he is not a cold, calculating murderer. He's a very gentle man.\\" His children, likewise, assert their belief that their mother committed suicide. Trial The prosecution argued that Bouwer killed his wife to obtain her life insurance and presented over 150 witnesses. His sister-in-law revealed that he claimed New Zealand was an ideal place to commit the perfect murder. Bouwer claimed he had undergone treatment for cancer in a South African hospital; however the doctors he had claimed had operated on him testified that they had never met him. It was revealed also that Bouwer had told students that injecting someone between the toes with insulin was the perfect way to commit a murder. On 19 November 2001, the jury took less than two hours to find him guilty (at the time, one of the fastest murder verdicts in years) and he was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 13 years. The sentence was increased to 15 years following an appeal by the crown. Bouwer's appeal was denied. He has since been described as a psychopath. Release On 18 September 2015, Bouwer was refused parole, and consequently had to serve at least another year. At his parole hearing, Bouwer changed his original defence, stating that his wife's death was assisted suicide, and that he had been advised against using this defence at his trial. Though he indicated his intention to apply for parole again the following year, his lawyer stated that his ill health prevented it. In late 2016, he petitioned Craig Foss, requesting that Foss intervene and cancel his deportation order, but Foss refused. In 2017, Bouwer was paroled and deported to South Africa.

It is native to South Africa and Eswatini, where it occurs in well-watered situations from coastal elevations to 1,250 m. The leafy, evergreen trees have rounded crowns and usually grow between 6 and 10 m tall, but regularly taller in forest. Range In South Africa they occur from the Eastern Cape to Limpopo. In Swaziland it is present in the western uplands, and in the Lebombo regions. They occur in coastal, scarp and mistbelt forests, rock outcrops, escarpments, riparian fringes, or in woodland. Bole and branches The bole is up to 1 m in diameter in forest. The bark of a young tree is smooth and brown, but becomes darker and rough with age. The branches have a rough texture and retain leaf scars. They exude a sticky milky sap when broken. Foliage The trees often carry some strikingly yellow or red leaves, especially in winter or on new growth. The simple leaves resemble Mango leaves, and have a scattered, alternate or subopposite arrangement. They measure up to 15 by 3 cm, and are paler below than above. They are glabrous and leathery in texture, and linear-oblong to narrowly elliptic in shape. The leaf margins may be frilled or wavy and are tightly rolled under. The primary, lateral veins have a straight and parallel arrangement. They terminate on, and often fork near the leaf margin. There are up to 40 veins a side, which are prominently raised below. They are light in colour, contrasting with the dark, glossy upper surfaces. Flowers The flowers are small (¬±4 mm in diameter) and are carried in axillary or terminal panicles. They are greenish-white (male) or pink to red, and appear in early spring (August to October). The ovary is ovoid and the calyx is saucer-shaped. The floral parts are in fives, but female flowers have three styles. Fruit The indehiscent fruit which appear from October to December, are smooth, fleshy drupes that mature to a pale mauve colour in autumn. Each contains a single seed. (cf. Ozoroa) Species interactions and uses Various forest mammals and birds feed on the fruit while on the tree, or after they are dropped, while the bark and foliage are browsed by Black rhino. The fine- grained wood has been used for furniture, planks and fence posts, but is not considered very durable. The ground up bark, though somewhat poisonous, is used as \\"red\\" muti (Zulu: uMuthi-embomvu). The sticky milky sap has been used a glue, for instance to fix assegai blades to their handles, or as a depilatory. The species can be cultivated from fresh seed and does well in gardens. They are useful as specimen trees or screening plants, and grow relatively fast, up to 80 cm a year. Though it thrives in warm, moist regions, it is also tolerant of drought and slight frost.

She began her career at the Homer G. Phillips Hospital, and later worked at the Saint Louis Children‚Äôs Hospital. She started her own private practice and was a faculty member at the Washington University School of Medicine. Her earliest work included decreasing infant mortality in Homer G. Phillips Hospital. Her private practice was notable for educating teens on proper sexual health. Additionally, she was one of the first doctors to address patient health as care for the patient and their support systems. Personal life Nash was born on August 8, 1921, to Homer Erwin Nash and Marie Antoinette Graves Nash. Her father, Homer Erwin Nash, returned from World War I and started a medical practiced called Herndon Building in 1910. Helen was the third of six children in the family, and they were raised in Atlanta. Homer and Marie's first child died when Homer was away at war. The baby died of dehydration from gastroenteritis, a disease later cured by Hartmann's solution. Helen Nash eventually met Dr. Hartmann. Both Nash's father and grandfather, Antoine Graves Nash, practiced medicine. Antoine sold his house to fund Helen's education for her medical degree. She married James B. Abernathy on August 1, 1964.  Educational degrees  Nash received her Bachelor's degree from Spelman College in 1941. She received her medical degree from Meharry Medical College in 1945. She made the honor roll in her first semester at Meharry Medical College and was one of only four women in her graduating class. She then began an internship at Homer G. Phillips Hospital. It was segregated at the time, and was the only hospital in St. Louis open to African-American doctors. She also completed her pediatric residency at Homer G. Phillips Hospital and became chief resident with the help of her mentor, Dr. Park J. White. She and White worked to improve the overall hygiene and equipment quality at the hospital, which reduced the infant mortality rate. For instance, they managed to implement more incubators and handwashing facilities.  Career  In 1949, Nash opened her own medical practice in St. Louis. She was known for her generosity and openness and saw mostly poor patients. She educated teens on sex in her \\"Sex Room,\\" which became a well- known feature of her practice. That same year, she became the first African American woman to join the staff at St. Louis Children's Hospital. She became president of the staff in 1977, a position she held until 1979. Also in 1949, Nash became the first African American woman to join the Washington University School of Medicine staff, where she served as a professor of clinical pediatrics. She retired as a professor in 1993, and went on to serve as the school's dean of minority affairs from 1994-1996. In 1953, Nash joined the American Academy of Pediatrics, Health and Welfare Council of Metropolitan St. Louis, and the Committee of the State Welfare Department of Missouri. Helen Nash interned at the pediatric ward, before desegregation. She directed many changes to basic hygiene of the patients as well as broke racial divides between the black and white hospitals.  Awards, honors, and distinctions  Nash accumulated a plethora of awards during her career, including a Doctor of Human Letters from Webster University in 1992 and a Lifetime Achievement Award in Health Care by St.Louis American Foundation in 1996. In addition to healthcare, Nash often visited the Missouri Botanical Garden during her internship years and became a member of the Garden's Board of Trustees in 1991. Nash was granted honorary lifetime memberships to two separate medical societies: the St. Louis Medical Society in 1975, and Medical Women's Society in 1991. In 1994, the NAACP magazine Crisis awarded Nash the Women's Medal of Honor.  Legacy  Nash's legacy is carried out through the Dr. Helen E. Nash Academic Achievement Award, which The Washington University School of Medicine has given out every year since 1996. In addition, in 2014, the St. Louis Children's Hospital began offering an internship to young woman of color in Nash's honor.

Early life Ross was born at the village of Meldorff in Schleswig-Holstein. He was the son of Johan Ross and Anna Stockhouf. His father was a painter and taught him the trade. He was first mentioned in 1721 when he listed as a journeyman in G√∂theborgs Arts and Painters - Embete. It also documents that he was a journeyman in his office in Hamburg. After his request for membership in the Gothenburg guild was refused, he traveled to Stockholm to continue his painting in 1730. Career Ross had several assignments in the Gothenburg region during the 1730s, and in 1730 he was doing extensive material rings and decorative works of Lundby main church (Stora Lundby kyrka). The church belongs to the Stora Lundby parish in the Diocese of Gothenburg and is situated on the outskirts of Gr√•bo in Lerum Municipality, V√§stra G√∂taland County, Sweden. In 1732, he appeared in Askim, and √ñrgryte in 1736 he painted window frames and barge boards. The colleagues in Gothenburg saw his independent intrusion into town with anxiety and irritability, and in 1737 invited Ross to join the ministry under the regulations of the guilds. He was named a \\"Painter in Gothenburg\\" on July 9, 1737 by resolution of the Royal Majesty and Reich H√∂glofl Commerce Collegium, and was alderman in the Gothenburg painters guild from 1744 to 1767, after which he took leave. Personal life Ross married Helena Sibuelen in June 1751. His son Johan Ross the younger (1723-1767) became a master painter in Gothenburg. He was also the father of church painter Maria Ross Carowsky (1723-1793) who in 1744 married the church painter Michael Carowsky (1707-1745). His granddaughter Christina Elisabeth Carowsky (1745-1797) was a Swedish artist. He was also the brother of Ditloff Ross (1706-1764), a church painter in Bor√•s. Works A number of works by Ross have been lost including church paintings at Landvetter (1732), Askim (1734), Partille (1753) and Backa (1759). Preserved art included altarpieces at the Church of √ñstad (√ñstads kyrka) and √ñjared chapel (√ñjareds kapell) both dating from 1729. The ceiling paintings in √ñrgryte old church (√ñrgryte gamla kyrka) likely made around 1740 by Ross and his son-in-law journeyman Michael Carowsky, who assisted in the painting of the church. The church belonging to the √ñrgryte parish in the Diocese of Gothenburg and is situated in the district of B√∂ in Gothenburg Municipality. Michael Carowsky became master painter in Gothenburg in 1742. Ross, however, was the one who was asked to perform \\"painting throughout himlingen, bleachers and seats\\" for 400 daler silver. The ceiling in the medieval S√§ve Church (S√§ve kyrka) was covered with twelve large rectangular paintings, where the six eastern painted for the church extension in 1737 were probably by John Ross. The church is located on Hisingen island and belongs to the parish of Tuve-S√§ve. A bust in the Museum of Gothenburg is believed to be a self-portrait of Ross. Collection Ross was also an art collector. His estate inventory from 1749 was about 100 paintings and a collection of 700 prints, with names such as Peter Paul Rubens and Rembrandt occur. Many of the fabrics were probably Ross' own works, but most appear to have been acquired through purchase, exchange or inheritance. The collection allowed Ross excellent opportunities to study various designs, compositions, techniques and color selection.

He played college football at the University of Georgia. Thompson graduated from Westover Comprehensive High School in Albany, Georgia, where he earned All-USA Defensive Player of the Year honors by USA Today. While he was in high school, scouts compared him to All-Pro defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh. High school career A native of Albany, Georgia, Thompson attended Westover Comprehensive High School where he was coached by Octavia Jones and former NFL defensive lineman Jeff Hunter. In his junior season, Thompson recorded 83 tackles (38 for loss) and 12 sacks, helping Westover to a third-round GHSA 4A playoff berth and its first region title in school history. He was named Junior of the Year by recruiting service Rivals.com. In his senior season, Thompson tallied 84 tackles, including 36 tackles for loss and four sacks, one interception and one forced fumble. He was named the Class 4A Defensive Player of the Year by The Atlanta Journal- Constitution, as well as National Defensive Player of the Year by USA Today. Unanimously regarded as one of the top recruits across all positions, Thompson was heavily recruited by elite NCAA Division I football programs, including Alabama, Florida State, Louisiana State, Michigan State, Auburn, and Southern California. His first offer came from Georgia while he was still a sophomore. When he verbally committed to Georgia over Auburn and Alabama in August 2014, he cited Georgia's early recruiting effort as one of the reasons: ‚ÄúGeorgia, they were my first offer. They were the first coaches that came down to see me and showed me the most love.‚Äù He signed a National Letter of Intent on February 4, 2015. College career Starting his college career with ‚Äústardom widely expected,‚Äù Thompson was projected as a space-eater in the mold of former Florida State nose tackle Timmy Jernigan, whom Georgia's defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt coached in 2013. Thompson played mostly in the second half during the first four games of the 2015 season, where he recorded 7 total tackles including a half a sack. On October 3, 2015, Thompson, listed as a defensive end, made his first start for the Bulldogs in a week 5 loss to the #13 Alabama Crimson Tide, where he recorded four total tackles. Thompson finished his true freshman year with 25 tackles (8 of which were solo), 2.5 tackles for a loss, and half a sack. Pro Football Focus listed him as the best true freshman on the interior defensive line, along with Missouri's Terry Beckner. In January 2018, Thompson declared his intent to forgo his senior year at Georgia and enter the 2018 NFL Draft. Professional career =Cleveland Browns= After going undrafted in the 2018 NFL Draft, Thompson signed a free agent deal with the Cleveland Browns. He was waived on July 30, 2018. =Arizona Hotshots= Thompson was signed by the Arizona Hotshots of the Alliance of American Football on January 18, 2019. He made the final roster on January 30, 2019.

It is a group of international companies that provides services and manufactures equipment to predict, measure, assess, and mitigate underwater sound. JASCO provides services on projects worldwide, operating out of 6 locations internationally, to the oil and gas, marine construction, energy, renewable energy, fisheries, maritime transport and defence sectors. The head office is located in Halifax, NS Canada. JASCO employs acousticians, bioacousticians, physicists, marine mammal scientists, engineers, technologists, and project managers.  Services  = Underwater Sound Monitoring = The firm deploys calibrated sound recorders to measure underwater sound levels. Projects may be long-term, wide-area acoustic monitoring programs or short-term measurements of industrial sources or marine vessels. The data collected are then analysed to determine the acoustic signature of the sound sources, characterize the ambient noise conditions at the measurement site, or detect and identify marine mammal vocalizations. JASCO measures underwater anthropogenic noise from many sources, including: * Pile driving * Seismic survey operations * Marine vessels * Construction (offshore and nearshore) * High-frequency sonar such as side-scan sonar, multibeam sonar, and echosounders = Predictive Modelling Studies = The firm also conducts numerical modelling studies to predict the underwater sound field of noise sources, which are often required for environmental impact assessments of industrial projects. The large sound levels produced by activities such as pile driving and seismic surveys can disturb and even injure marine mammals and fish. The results of underwater acoustic modelling are commonly expressed as safety radii (or exclusion zone radii) that are used by marine mammal observers during operations to ensure animals are not exposed to harmful levels of noise. Results are also provided as contour maps of the sound levels around the noise source. These maps can be used to assess or mitigate the impacts of the noise on marine mammals, fish, and other aquatic wildlife. JASCO also performs modelling of aquatic species‚Äô movement and behaviour, exposing simulated marine animals (called animats) to 3-D modelled sound fields. Unique movement and behaviour parameters are determined for each species from animal behaviour studies to simulate how the animals behave and move within the environment. The acoustic exposure of each animat is determined and compared to the regulated exposure criteria to predict potential environmental impacts of an acoustic source.  Products  = OceanObserver acquisition and processing system = The OceanObserver is an underwater acoustic data recorder that also does onboard processing, meaning that it can process the sound data to, for example, detect marine mammal vocalizations so that the information can be telemetered to shore via undersea cable, Wi-Fi, VHF radio, satellite, etc. That way the raw acoustic data, which can be very large, need not be transmitted (and often cannot be transmitted due to bandwidth restrictions). The OceanObserver is used in numerous applications including robotic vehicles (e.g. underwater gliders), spar buoys, real-time monitoring buoys, research buoys, and cabled underwater observatories to transmit acoustic detections and measurements to shore in near real-time. Applications include: * Real-time pile driving monitoring: sending peak sound pressure levels to shore to ensure regulated threshold levels are not exceeded. * Marine mammal detection and avoidance: Detecting and localizing marine mammals over vast areas to allow alerting nearby vessels or operations to prevent collision or disturbance. For example, locating North Atlantic right whales in the Gulf of St Lawrence to enable temporary closures of affected areas. * Quantifying and mitigating vessel noise: Semi-permanent seabed monitoring stations, connected to shore by undersea cable, sending vessel sound source measurements to determine how to reduce impacts from vessel underwater noise pollution. = AMAR G4 underwater sound recorder = Two AMAR G4s being deployed near Kitimat, BC, each with a hydrophone surrounded by a yellow shroud to reduce flow-induced noise over the hydrophone The successor of the AMAR G3, the AMAR G4 (Autonomous Multichannel Acoustic Recorder Generation 4) is an underwater acoustic and oceanographic data recorder with 10 TB of removable SD memory cards and Wi-Fi communications. It consists of recording electronics housed inside a watertight pressure housing. The AMAR can be connected to up to 4 hydrophones sampled at 24-bit resolution at rates up to 512 kHz Up to 7 oceanographic sensors (e.g., dissolved oxygen, salinity, acidity, temperature) can be connected, allowing the system to be used as a mini ocean observatory. It can include a chip-scale atomic clock to allow precise timing and synchronization of multiple AMARs. Four models are available, spanning water depth ratings of 250 to 6700 m. External battery pack housings are available for deployment lifetimes of up to a year. = AMAR G3 underwater sound recorder = The AMAR G3 (Autonomous Multichannel Acoustic Recorder Generation 3) is an underwater acoustic and oceanographic data recorder. It consists of recording electronics housed inside a watertight pressure housing. The AMAR can be connected to up to 8 hydrophones sampled at 24-bit resolution at rates up to 128 kHz, and another high-frequency hydrophone sampled at 16-bit resolution at rates up to 687.5 kHz. Oceanographic sensors (e.g., dissolved oxygen, salinity, acidity, temperature) can also be connected, allowing the system to be used as a mini ocean observatory. Several AMARs were used on the Strait of Georgia branch of the VENUS ocean observatory, providing publicly available underwater sound recordings.

Three years later, in January 2010, he became director of the group. Persson contributed to its rebranding from a UK think tank opposing UK involvement in further EU integration to a European think tank advocating liberal EU wide reforms. To do so Persson recruited a pan-EU staff and co-founded and joining the advisory board of Open Europe Berlin (launched 2012). He has written and published on a broad range of issues including the eurozone crisis, institutional reform, EU budget, financial regulation, trade policy, German politics and Britain's position in Europe.

In 2012, however, Rennie noted that Open Europe had by then fallen in with the Europhile consensus saying \\"the hostility of earlier reports\\" was \\"muted\\" under Open Europe's then director, Mats Persson, and that the group had \\"worked to shake off an early reputation as a partisan campaign group, which concentrated exclusively on negative aspects of the European project\\". He credited the group for eschewing \\"the nationalism of many eurosceptic groups\\" and defending the concept of freedom of movement, but added that the organisation \\"remains as much a campaign group as think tank.\\" After Persson's departure to work for No.10, Open Europe decided not to support David Cameron's campaign to stay in the EU, adopting instead a neutral stance in the 2016 EU referendum in the UK. = UK Government = Persson was recruited in 2015 as special adviser to UK Prime Minister David Cameron. In this role he advocated David Cameron's EU reform program and the UK's EU membership prior to the referendum on the UK's continuing membership of the EU.

The family moved to Akron, Ohio when the girls were nine. Edward and his new wife homeschooled the twins until they entered Buchtel College (now known as the University of Akron). Education and career Along with her sister, Edith earned a Bachelor of Philosophy from Buchtel in 1892. She then went on to Cornell University, and wrote her Master of Science thesis on white blood cells in 1893. From 1894 to 1899, Claypole served as a professor of physiology and histology at Wellesley College, and also headed the zoology department for two years. In 1899, she started work in the medical department at Cornell where she stayed until 1901 when she moved to Pasadena to be near her stepmother, who was ill. In 1904, Claypole received her M.D. from the University of California. She specialized in pathology, practicing in Pasadena and Los Angeles for eight years. In January 1912, Dr. Claypole began volunteer work with the department of pathology at the University of California, Berkeley, working under Dr. Frederick Parker Gay, and was later appointed as Research Associate. Death On a request from Dr. William Osler, Dr. Claypole was working on an immunization for typhoid (needed for the armies of World War I).

The restored interior is dominated by a fine ‚Äòrood screen‚Äô (see Derwen), its top rail intricately carved with trailing foliage and its lower panels with ‚Äòcandle-flame‚Äô motifs. These date to about 1538, the date once inscribed in the big east window above the altar. The window now displays fragments of its original stained glass, including heads of men and angels and (in the topmost left-hand light) the nail-pierced feet of a crucified Christ. The roof is also late medieval, as may be the massive dug-out chest hewn from a single tree trunk. Later treasures include the pulpit of 1695 and an elaborate wooden chandelier with beast-head decoration, dated 1725. Church open by arrangement. Please see Church notice board.

They are situated near the ancient city of Zeila. The Zeila Archipelago is made of six small islands all of which are low-lying and have sandy beaches. The largest of these islands are Sacadin and Aibat, which are six and nine miles off the coast of Zeila, respectively. There is also a lighthouse at Aibat. Etymology The name for the archipelago comes from the Somali Sultan Sa'ad ad-Din II who was killed by Emperor Yeshaq I of Abyssinia on the main island in 1415. Along with his name, there many different spelling for the island such as Sa'ad ed Din, Sa'ad-ed-din, and Sa'ad-ad-Din. The archpeliogo is also known as the Zeila Archipelago and the Sa'ad ad-Din group. Environment The Sa'ad ad-Din Islands are well known for their splendid coral reefs similar to those found on the southern coast of Oman. These reefs are the most diverse and well formed coral reefs on the coast of the Gulf of Aden and possibly the largest in the region. From provincial counts, ninety- nine different species of coral from forty-three different generas have been found on the islands. There are also a hundred and thirty-two different species of coral fish found around the archipelago. Many of these species include those also found in the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and the Indian Ocean. The island of Sa'ad ad-Din and Aibat (called Ceebaad in Somali) both are sites of major bird colonies. On the island of Sa'ad ad-Din alone, there were more than 100,000 breeding pairs recorded. Following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and other NGO worked with local authorizes to establish protected areas and monitor fishers on the islands. Demographics The archipelago currently has no permanent residents and is uninhabited, though it is still occasionally visited by tourists, local fishermen, and those who wish to honor Sa'ad ad-Din II.

Early life Zelda K. Norldinger was born in South Carolina in 1932 to parents Joseph and Alice Kingoff. She moved to Richmond Virginia in 1947. She graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School in 1950 and Marjorie Webster Jr. College in 1952. After attending the Sally Thomkins School of Practical Nursing, Nordlinger graduated in 1984 from Virginia Commonwealth University with a Bachelor of Arts degree. Career Zelda Kingoff Nordlinger, influenced by Betty Friedan's influential book, The Feminine Mystique, launched into efforts which would organize and empower women in the Richmond area in the late 1960s. Nordlinger hoped to congregate with local women to discuss women's concerns, goals, and experiences by forming a discussion group. Nordlinger plastered flyers in local establishments including the YMCA to gain support and awareness for this effort, forming the Women's Rights of Richmond, VA. This group of women, including women's activist Mary Holt Woolfork Carlton, would eventually become the founding members of the Richmond Chapter of the National Organization for Women. (NOW is a nationwide women's activist organization which focuses on attaining equality for women by ending discriminatory policies which restrict women's rights, including female reproductive rights, vocational and financial opportunities, political representation and status, and societal stigmatization.) With the addition of new women from the ERA in 1974, this chapter changed for the better. This new group of women worked on procedure and organization and became a success. The combination of these two groups of women led Richmond's NOW chapter to work towards higher goals and a broader movement for women. Zelda actively led and participated in NOW's activist efforts; predominantly in the fight for reproductive rights, legislative protection for victims of rape, sexual discrimination, the desegregation of local establishments, and the desegregation of employment ads in Richmond periodicals. Her advocacy on behalf of women grew throughout the next three decades, gaining her notoriety and the opportunity to become more involved in the movement. She served a position on the National Organization of Women's legislative task force on rape, the State Board, and eventually became the State Coordinator for the group in 1975. She also collaborated with groups including the Virginia League for Planned Parenthood, the Virginia Foundation for Women, the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Women's Lobby of Virginia. Nordlinger was also involved in the National Women's Political Caucus. She lobbied the Virginia State Assembly for abortion and rape reform laws as well as for the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment throughout her career. Controversial activism Zelda Nordlinger spent a great amount of her later life organizing and participating in women's advocacy via protests, letter writing, speeches, lobbying, marches, and debates. One of Nordlinger's most notable and controversial accomplishments was her participation in a strike on August 26, 1970, carried out in conjunction with The National Women's Strike for Equality Day. On this day, Nordlinger along with three other female activists organized a sit-in protest at the local Thalhimers Department Store, with the goal of integrating of the male-only Thalhimers Soup Bar. Another one of Nordlinger's protests revolved around the sexual discrimination within employment ads in Richmond area periodicals. In this effort, Nordlinger handed out flyers and brochures decrying the discriminatory policies of these businesses, right outside the Richmond Times-Dispatch and News Leader Buildings. On October 12, 1971, Nordlinger provoked further controversy by speaking to the Fort Lee Officer's Wives Club about women's liberation at Camp Pickett. Nordlinger was asked to speak by the Program Chairman of the club, but her perceived radical views on the state of the military and domestic labor were met with a fury of objection. Individuals picketed her appearance, demonstrating their displeasure with having a feminist figure sharing her views. Among the protesters was Ruth Shuey, a journalist for a news periodical in Hopewell, who denounced Nordlinger's speech, stating, \\"Women's Liberation was set back ten years Tuesday, when Zelda K. Nordlinger of the National Organization for Women tangled with officers' wives at Fort Lee.\\" Despite this public denouncement of her words, T.E. Ross, the Program Chair whom had invited Nordlinger to speak, thanked Nordlinger in a subsequent letter writing, \\"You woke many a stagnant mind and brought on a new surge of awareness to us.\\" Legacy Zelda Kingoff Nordlinger was an influential figure in women's rights advocacy in Richmond, and she achieved many successes. Nordlinger was responsible for catalyzing the first rape reform laws under Bill Axselle in Virginia, through her successful lobbying and revisions of state statutes in the 1970s. Her efforts resulted in improved protection for rape victims during trials, including the creation of a hotline and a task force tasked with staying with individuals during their trials, making the legislative process less daunting for victims of rape. Throughout her career, Nordlinger kept a collection of advocacy newsletters, photographs, pamphlets, letters, thoughts, journals, press-releases, and other items related to her activism. This collection of over five-hundred personal articles was left to educational institutions throughout the region including Virginia Commonwealth University, the College of William and Mary, and The Library of Virginia. This contribution created the opportunity for the public to explore significant primary accounts of an influential leader in Richmond's history as well as the evolution of the Women's Rights Movement as a whole. In an interview conducted through Virginia Commonwealth University a year before her death, Nordlinger expressed her sentiments regarding the future of the movement, \\"I have an enduring faith that the evolution of this whole civilization all over the world has become part and parcel of the future for women and I don't see much hope that men are going to continue in the roles of war-makers. I see women taking a very vital part in calling the signals and I see a only good future for humankind as a result because I think the female influence is what's going to take us into the future.\\" Publications Zelda wrote \\"A Decade of Change for Women, Where Do We Go From Here,\\" which was based on the many accomplishment of women over the decade from 1970 to 1980. Some of these accomplishments include: in 1970: The United States Senate holds the first Equal Rights Amendment hearing since 1956. In 1971: New York City bans sex discrimination in public accommodations. In 1972: Sally Priesand is ordained at the first female rabbi. In 1973: the Supreme Court legalized abortion. In 1974: the Supreme Court outlaws mandatory maternity leave for teachers, and women being admitted into the Merchant Marine Academy. In 1975: The Supreme Court outlaws automatic exclusion of women from jury duty. In 1976: NASA accepted Women for astronaut training for the first time. In 1978: More women than men enter college for the first time in American History. And in 1979: the Supreme Court ruled that a minor has the constitutional right to have an abortion.

Jackson, 641 F.2d 934 (D.C. Cir. 1981), was a D.C. Circuit opinion, written by Judge Skelly Wright, that held that workplace sexual harassment could constitute employment discrimination under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Facts Sandra Bundy was hired at the District of Columbia Department of Corrections (DCDC) in 1970 and was promoted several times, becoming a vocational rehabilitation specialist who helped find jobs for ex-offenders. From 1972 onward she was sexually harassed by a number of fellow employees and supervisors, including Delbert Jackson, who later became the director of the DCDC. Bundy's supervisors regularly questioned her about her sexual proclivities and invited her back to their apartments or to motels. When she complained to her supervisors' superior, he told her that \\"any man in his right mind would want to rape you\\" and then propositioned her himself. Afterwards, Bundy's supervisors began to criticize her for taking too much time off and poor work performance, though she had never received such criticisms before her attempt to complain. Bundy sought help from the Equal Employment Opportunity officers at the DCDC, but they only cautioned her against bringing unwarranted complaints. However, Bundy filed an informal and then a formal complaint. When no action was taken, Bundy filed suit in 1977 in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Judgment The District Court found that sexual harassment was standard operating procedure at the DCDC, but held that Bundy's rights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had not been violated. Title VII prohibits discrimination (on the basis of sex or certain other characteristics) with respect to \\"compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.\\". The District Court held that, despite Bundy's allegations, her promotions had not been delayed or denied due to her rejections of her supervisors' unwanted sexual advances. On appeal, Judge Wright's opinion for the court agreed with Bundy that \\"'conditions of employment' include the psychological and emotional work environment.\\"Bundy, 641 F.2d at 944. Wright relied on analogies to racial discrimination cases such as Rogers v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a Fifth Circuit case in which a Hispanic employee sued her employer, a firm of opticians, for creating a discriminatory and offensive work environment by giving discriminatory service to its Hispanic clients. Wright agreed with that case's conclusion that Title VII should be construed broadly to extend beyond discrimination in hiring, firing, and promoting; sexual harassment, like racial harassment, can poison the atmosphere of employment and thereby violate Title VII. If this were not the case, Wright pointed out, \\"an employer could sexually harass a female employee with impunity by carefully stopping short of firing the employee or taking any other tangible actions against her in response to her resistance.\\"Bundy, 641 F.2d at 945. The case was remanded to the District Court with instructions to order the director of the DCDC \\"to ensure that complaints of sexual harassment receive thorough and effective treatment within the formal process the agency has already established.\\"Bundy, 641 F.2d at 948. On Bundy's claims for back pay and a promotion she had been denied, Wright's opinion held that the District Court had failed to properly allocate the burden of proof. Wright established a formula as follows: > To establish a prima facie case of illegal denial of promotion in > retaliation against the plaintiff's refusal of sexual advances by her > supervisors, the plaintiff must show (1) that she was a victim of a pattern > or practice of sexual harassment attributable to her employer (Bundy has, of > course, already shown this); and (2) that she applied for and was denied a > promotion for which she was technically eligible and of which she had a > reasonable expectation. If the prima facie case is made out, the employer > then must bear the burden of showing, by clear and convincing evidence, that > he had legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for denying the claimant the > promotion. Significance With Bundy v. Jackson, the D.C. Circuit became the first federal appeals court to hold that workplace sexual harassment was employment discrimination and a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Five years later the Supreme Court agreed with this holding in Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson.

During the late 1930s and early 1940s, military maneuvers increased worldwide and sexual hygiene and conduct became major problems for the troops. Soldiers and sailors on assignment overseas were often lonely, had time to spare, got homesick, or were just looking for female companionship. This resulted in many men having multiple sex partners, and as a result, became a major health concern. During the Great War, venereal diseases (V.D.) had caused the United States Army to lose 18,000 servicemen per day. Although by 1944 this number had been reduced 30-fold, there were still around 606 servicemen incapacitated daily. This drop in numbers was partly because of the Army's effort to raise awareness about the dangers faced by servicemen through poor sexual hygiene, and also because of the important developments in medicine. In late 1943 a case of gonorrhea required a hospital treatment of 30 days, and curing syphilis remained a 6-month ordeal. By mid-1944, the average case of gonorrhea was reduced to 5 days, and in many cases the patient remained on duty while being treated. Education Soldiers and sailors were taught to either abstain from sex or commit to a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who had tested negative for venereal disease. However, latex condoms were encouraged for every sexual encounter. =Posters= upright To raise awareness about practicing safe sex amongst its recruits, the U.S. Government produced a series of posters which were displayed in Army barracks, hospitals, and railway stations. Many of the posters were straightforward like the awareness posters of today. The Selective Service discovered that almost fifteen percent of those who were eligible for the draft were already infected with a venereal disease, sparking an intense anti-venereal disease campaign across America. Red-light districts were shut down, and American cities sought new laws which would criminalize prostitution to protect young men from contracting a venereal infection. =Pamphlets= The U.S. Government produced a number of pamphlets which were issued to troops educating them about the importance of good sexual health. One of these pamphlets was \\"Sex Hygiene and Venereal Disease\\", printed August 1, 1940 by the U.S. Government Printing Office. There were also 1942 and 1943 editions. The pamphlet was to be furnished to each recruit upon enlistment. The booklet not only offered information to soldiers about avoiding V.D., but also what to do if they became infected. The pamphlet provided sufficient information about various diseases to allow troops to diagnose diseases and infections without visiting the Pro-Station. The following is the Summary which is offered by the pamphlet: :1. Manhood comes from healthy sex organs. :2. It is not necessary to have sexual intercourse in order to keep strong and well. :3. Disease may ruin the sex organs and deprive a man of his health and happiness. :4. You have a fine healthy body now. Keep it that way. :5. Venereal diseases come from sex relations or intimate contact with a diseased person. They are very serious. Gonorrhea and syphilis are two of the worst. :6. Most prostitutes have venereal disease. :7. Guard against venereal disease by staying away from \\"easy\\" women. Don't gamble your health away. :8. If you do not have self-control then do not fail to take safety measures. :9. If you get diseased, report at once to your commanding officer. Time is most important. :10. Will power and self-control help to keep a man‚Äôs body and mind healthy. :11. A healthy body and a healthy mind lead to happiness. Many commanding officers told their men \\"just because you have the desire is no reason why you must give in to it. Sex relations in the military should be kept for marriage.\\" The Army and Navy wanted to make a dramatic statement to scare lower ranking personnel by saying: \\"Between people who aren't married they often lead to shame, sorrow and diseases. The public knows this so well that laws forbid sex relations between persons not married to each other. Good morals limit these sex relations to marriage\\". =Training films= Sex Hygiene, US Army training film, directed by John Ford By 1941 many of the sex education materials had been created by the Public Health Service. Hollywood produced motion picture films that showed men exactly how to play safe and what to do if they caught syphilis or gonorrhea. Later on these films were made available for wider distribution by the nation's various state and local health departments. Wet dreams and masturbation In the 1940s personnel were taught that a wet dream is when the sex gland fills up with sperm and overflows while a man is asleep. This may happen several times a month or only once or twice in several months. Many medical officers taught their personnel that a wet dream is normal for men and that they needed to take extra precautions against doctors that may try to mislead them into buying their fake cures. During World War II, masturbation was defined as having the same effect on the body as a wet dream. \\"Although a childish habit, it does no real harm and does not lead to insanity. If you have this unfortunate habit, try to control it as a matter of pride.\\" Venereal diseases In World War II venereal disease was a serious problem for the US Army and Navy. In some hospitals one out of eight men had contracted some form of venereal disease. Two of the worst venereal diseases known to the Medical Department during the Second World War were gonorrhea and syphilis. Consequently the majority of treatment and awareness programs had great emphasis on these two infections in particular. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that can cause long-term complications and/or death if not treated correctly. Symptoms in adults are divided into stages. These stages are primary, secondary, latent, and late syphilis. Syphilis has been called \\"the great imitator\\" because it has so many possible symptoms, many of which look like symptoms from other diseases. The painless syphilis sore that the soldier or sailor would get after they were first infected can be confused for an ingrown hair, zipper cut, or other seemingly harmless bump. The non- itchy body rash that develops during the second stage of syphilis can show up on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, all over the body, or in just a few places. Men can be infected with syphilis and have very mild symptoms or none at all.[6] Also called the \\"clap\\" or \\"drip,\\" gonorrhea is a contagious disease transmitted most often through sexual contact with an infected person. It can also be spread by contact with infected bodily fluids, so both men and women are susceptible. The infection spreads most often among people who have many sex partners.[7] During the war, medics were generally supplied with prophylactic kits in bulk, designed to allow a man to perform treatment on himself if he feared he had sex with an infected woman. The individual packet contained a tube containing 5 grams of ointment (30% calomel + 15% sulfathiazole), a direction sheet explaining how to apply the ointment, a soap impregnated cloth and cleansing tissue. Sometimes the men were issued condoms (usually three to a pack) and sometimes they were given Sulfonamide (sulfa drugs) or other pills to carry \\"just in case.\\" The U.S. Military highly encouraged the men to use condoms during sexual intercourse, concerned that servicemen would bring home diseases and infect their wives. Government training films urged soldiers, \\"Don't forget - put it on before you put it in.\\"[3] Prevalence of disease The military struggled greatly with determining the true rates of venereal disease among the troops. According to the U.S. Army Medical Department's Office of Medical History, many soldiers already had V.D. before enlisting, but were counted as a new infection when they were treated by medical personnel, increasing the officially recorded rate of V.D. Additionally, some soldiers were transferred between hospitals during treatment, but were counted as a new infection when they arrived at the new hospital, further increasing the V.D. rate. The V.D. rate was artificially lowered by medical staff who treated patients without recording it. This was done mostly at the request of the troops, who feared punishment for contracting V.D. Throughout the war, officers had a noticeably lower recorded rate of V.D. The Army believes that this was because officers were able to get medical treatment from Army medical personnel, and then pressure them into not recording the incident. Despite these issues, the Army concluded that the lowest rates of V.D. occurred in 1943, then rose throughout 1944 and 1945, and again increased markedly after the cessation of hostilities. Despite the raise in V.D. throughout the war, personnel noneffectiveness due to V.D. decreased, likely due to better treatment. Women's health World War II also saw the creation of women‚Äôs military corps. For the first time, women were able to serve their country, though not in a combat capacity, without serving as a nurse or laundress. In the Women's Army Corps, women were enlisted and commissioned as soldiers and officers in much the same way that the Army enlisted and commissioned men. Women serving in the Armed Forces, however, were absent from venereal disease poster artwork during the World War II era. Government input Rabbit, in sailor's suit, running in direction of sign pointing to Prophylactic Station (\\"pro\\"), 1945, 'U.S. Government Printing Office) The first American Forces stationed in Northern Ireland (USANIF) and in the British Isles (USAFBI) received special attention from the Medical Department. The units were directed, in cooperation with local authorities, to establish the first off-base Prophylactic Stations and trace the contacts of servicemen who became infected. American units were warned to keep everything as tactful as possible, and to use general terms such as U.S. Army Aid Station, instead of Prophylactic Station. Despite the measures taken, v.d. spread among the troops, and even with rapid and effective treatment, including the use of sulfa drugs and penicillin, the cost to the Army was heavy due to lost time from duty, diversion of medical resources, and political and social tensions between American Forces and their British hosts. This also occurred in France, after the liberation of Paris, and to some extent in Germany, although this country was by then militarily defeated and occupied. V.D. control officers were appointed and special recreation programs were introduced in close cooperation with the Red Cross and Special Services. Sexual education was emphasized and line officers, surgeons, and chaplains gave lectures. Laws In 1940, the military, the Public Health Service, and the American Social Hygiene Association, a private organization, agreed to cooperate in creating a plan \\"to defend the armed and industrial forces from venereal disease.\\" The May Act, which was passed in 1941, enables the Justice department to override local authorities and directly police areas that presented a threat to the safety of either military or industrial workers. The Lanham Act, which was also passed in 1941, specifically provided the funds for hospitals where carriers of venereal disease could be quarantined until they had been cured. The Comstock laws effectively made any form of contraception illegal in the United States, punishable as a misdemeanor with a six-month minimum prison sentence. Titled the Eight ‚Äì Point Agreement, this plan called for an expansion of the service's existing campaign to control venereal diseases. This gave the Army, Navy, Public Health Service, and ASHA developed and implemented aggressive measures to track the spread of venereal disease, to encourage the infected to seek medical care, to provide treatment to those who were infected, to repress prostitution, and finally, to promote sex education to arrest the further spread of disease.Postscript Cumberland Evening Times, November 1941 Another Enemy to be fought Brownsville Herald, December 13, 1941; Venereal; Dallas Morning News January 1944, \\"State Venereal Disease Control is Highly Praise in New Book\\". Discrimination =Gay men= During World War II social bias on the increase in authority of psychiatric and scientific logic, the military chose to exclude homosexuals from the military because homosexuality was considered a mental illness, and it was believed that homosexuals would hurt the productivity of the armed forces. The military used an unreliable screening process through military psychiatrists in determining if an individual was homosexual or not. Some psychiatrists did not enforce their screening, which let homosexuals into the military. Others simply lied to psychiatrists about their sexual orientation and were able to get into the armed forces. Anti-homosexual policies were useless and homosexuals were very much part of the military. Homosexuality was a crime according to the military and punishable by prison. Because military prisons already held more than capacity, a new discharge system was used instead, which essentially kicked out homosexuals from the armed service. Using mental illness as an excuse, the military was able to justify discharging homosexual GIs from the military. =Lesbians= The formation of the Women‚Äôs Army Corps provided a place for lesbian women within an otherwise wholly male institution. Rumors of difficult enrollment screenings for gay men deterred very few lesbians. Because of women's marginal status in the military before World War II, neither the Army nor the Navy had developed policies or procedures concerning lesbian enrollment in the armed services (p. 28). Even on the home front, criminal law generally ignored lesbians and women were rarely prosecuted in court for engaging in sex acts with other women. At the onset of the war, psychiatrists and military officers reflected this history of invisibility and issued no policies or procedures for screening out lesbians (p. 28). The pressure to meet unfilled personnel quotas was also a significant force in keeping recruiting officers and examiners from prying into the sexual lives of women volunteers (p. 29). During entrance exams, female masculinity, unlike male effeminacy, was not considered to be a disqualifying defect, reflecting the military‚Äôs need for women who could perform traditional male jobs. The Women's Army Corps represented a pivotal turn in cultural understandings around gender and sexuality. As the culture of the 1940s grew increasingly anxious about women's sexuality as a result of the shift in public or private spheres, and homosexuality in particular, the formation of the WAC sparked a storm of public speculation and concern of the potential breakdown of heterosexual norms and sexual morality.p. 68 Historically, women had been most visibly associated with the military as prostitutes. The general public expressed fear that, in forming the WAC, the military was trying to create an organized coalition of prostitutes to service male GIsp. 66. Print media of the World War II era supported a dual effort to maintain a sense of \\"normalcy\\" through prescriptions of control and containment of women's sexuality, within and outside of the military, while simultaneously \\"normalizing\\" the drafting of women into the armed services.Hartmann, Susan. \\"Women, War, and the Limits of Change.\\" National Forum 74 (1995): 15-18. (p.113) The media both responded to and reinforced emergent cultural and political perceptions of a threat to the existing social structure. The response of Women‚Äôs Army Corps Director Colonel Oveta Culp Hobby was to challenge this by characterizing female soldiers as chaste and asexual (p. 66). Like advertising and other media elements, military propaganda emphasized traditional female qualities and roles. For example, a magazine article featuring the WAC declared, \\"You'll like this girl. She does a man's work‚Ä¶servicing airplanes, but she hasn't lost any of her feminine sweetness or charm\\" (p. 17). =African Americans= In segregated America, African Americans disproportionately lived in poverty. Compared with whites, the majority of African American military personnel had limited to no access to education opportunities, good wages, or health care, all factors that were crucial in protecting Americans from venereal disease and ensuring treatment for the infected. By the 1940s these problems had created a situation in which ‚Äúsexually transmitted diseases were nationally known as special problems of the black people.\\" As America continued to be segregated even though African, Asian, and Native American soldiers fought for democracy abroad, federal funds were desperately needed simply to ensure that sex education programs could reach those who needed them. Both immediately before and during the war, these federal funds transformed the battle against sexual ignorance and the problems caused by this ignorance throughout the United States, but especially in the South by ensuring that all races and classes received some form of sex education. =Women= \\"She may look clean - but\\" In the United States, World War II-era venereal disease posters depicting women were created for an overwhelmingly male, military audience. These posters warned men in the Armed Forces away from civilian women, depicting women as the primary carriers and spreaders of venereal diseases. These sentiments were mirrored in the civilian populations as young civilian women were criminalized for engaging in sexual activities. Worse yet this view did little to protect women who engaged in extramarital intercourse. But because many of these women worked in essential military industries, this approach also threatened the morale of the war effort.

Located on a former quarry site, the urban-style, sustainable, transit-oriented village is organized around a community park that cascades down the terraced property. Civita development plans call for 60 to 70 acres of parks and open space, 4,780 residences (including approximately 478 affordable units), an approximately 480,000-square-foot retail center, and 420,000 square feet for an office/business campus. The Civita project is budgeted at $2 billion and being developed by Sudberry Properties, in partnership with the Grant family, which has operated the former quarry since 1937.  Location  Civita is located just north of Friars Road between SR 163 and I-805 in San Diego‚Äôs Mission Valley, which was the site of the first Spanish settlement in California, established in 1769. Mission Valley is named for Mission San Diego de Alcal√°, the first California Mission. Civita is located about 7 mi (5 km) from downtown San Diego and San Diego International Airport. = Geography = The Civita property is located in a former quarry north of the San Diego River. The property slopes down toward the river. The Civita plan calls for development on a series of terraces. Each terrace contains housing and a level footpath leading to a central park.\\\\-  History  During the first half of the twentieth century, Mission Valley was a largely undeveloped expanse of dairy farms and agricultural operations. In the early 1900s, Franklin and Alta Grant purchased land along the San Diego River, hoping to find oil. Instead, they discovered rock and the family mined the quarry for about 70 years. The Grants' grandchildren decided to turn the family property into a walkable village. They partnered with Sudberry Properties, a longtime San Diego developer. After nine years of planning, a plan to develop the Quarry Falls community (now called Civita) was approved by the San Diego City Council by a vote of 7-1. More than 130 people attended the meeting. Supporters, including representatives from environmental and smart-growth groups, outnumbered opponents 4-to-1. In 2010, the developers broke ground on Civita and the first homes were occupied in 2011.  Land planning  The 230-acre Civita project is one of the largest examples of ‚Äúurban infill,‚Äù which is the development of vacant or underused city sites, in the U.S. Civita development plans call for 60 to 70 acres of parks and open space, 4,780 residences (including approximately 478 affordable units), an approximately 480,000-square-foot retail center, and 420,000 square feet for an office/business campus. The $2 billion project embraces San Diego‚Äôs ‚ÄúCity of Villages‚Äù concept ‚Äì compact, pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods that are located within walking distance of public transit and other needs. The Civita master plan was designed by local architect and planner Gordon Carrier, a principal at Carrier Johnson + Culture. Carrier‚Äôs plan will ultimately create a high-density urban village organized around a network of parks and open space, with housing, retail, office, and civic components linked by pedestrian trails, walkable streets, and bike paths. Carrier commented that the goal of the Civita design is to create a ‚Äúreal‚Äù neighborhood that ‚Äúcombines topography, walkability and the ability to live, work and play in the same place‚Ä¶[T]he design makes it convenient for residents to walk or ride bicycles rather than use cars, by locating shopping, parks and recreation facilities within walking distance of their homes.‚Äù ‚ÄúCivita serves as a perfect model for the future growth of the region,‚Äù said Brian Schoenfisch, a senior planner for the city of San Diego.  Sustainability  = Green building practices = Sudberry Properties, the developer of Civita, incorporated numerous green building practices in the Civita design. For example, more street trees have been planted than were required by the city of San Diego. Sudberry also specified low-energy LED lights for traffic signals and street lighting. Sudberry‚Äôs Civita master plan also encourages people to walk by rearranging the sloping site in a series of terraces, each containing housing and level footpaths to and from the central park and stream, which are expected to experience heavy use. In 2012, Sudberry Properties entered into an agreement with San Diego Gas & Electric to create a ‚ÄúSmart Energy Community‚Äù for Civita. The agreement specifies potential installation of new smart grid technologies that will make Civita more sustainable and energy efficient. The technologies include solar panels, electric vehicle charging stations, fuel cell generation, battery storage, and enhanced energy management tools for residents. They are expected to help residents and businesses conserve electricity, preserve the environment, and establish Civita as a model for future low-carbon communities. = Homes and commercial buildings = Energy-conservation and sustainability are high priority goals for Civita‚Äôs home and commercial building designs. Homebuilders are required specify Energy Star appliances and exceed California‚Äôs Title 24 energy requirements by 15 percent. The first apartment neighborhood in Civita, Circa 37, exceeded the Title 24 requirements, achieving energy efficiency of almost 20 percent. For Circa 37, Sudberry Properties made extensive use of energy-efficient lighting, windows and HVAC systems, a 145 kW solar array that powers 80 percent of the common area electricity consumption, and ‚Äúcool roofs‚Äù that minimize heat transfer. Storm water runoff from residential areas in Civita and parts of Serra Mesa are primarily directed to a unique bioswale system in Civita‚Äôs central park. The bioswale, which has the appearance of a natural streambed, will remove silt and pollution from the runoff through natural biofiltration and reestablish plant and animal habitats. = Ride sharing = In 2013, Civita launched a ride-sharing program that featured a fleet of smart electric drive vehicles through car2go. Currently, six public electric car charging stations are onsite, and more are scheduled to come online as development progresses. = Awards = In 2009, Civita achieved a Stage 1 Gold rating for the U.S. Green Building Council‚Äôs 2009 LEED-ND (Neighborhood Development) pilot and received the California Governor‚Äôs Environmental and Economic Leadership Award. In 2010, Civita was designated as a California Catalyst Community by the California Department of Housing and Community Development to support innovation and test sustainable strategies that reflect the interdependence of environmental, economic, and community health.  Civita Park  In 2013, following hundreds of public meetings and 10 years of planning, the San Diego Parks and Recreation Board approved the design of Civita‚Äôs central park, Civita Park. Construction of the park began in 2014 and was completed in 2015. Civita Park slopes down the former quarry property in a series of mesas that provide residents with defined areas to exercise, relax, gather, or play.

He was Minister of Public Education and Religious Affairs in the Ministry of Jules de Polignac during the last months of the Bourbon Restoration. Early years Martial C√¥me Annibal Perp√©tue Magloire de Guernon-Ranville came from the Guernon family, one of the oldest of the Norman nobility. They acquired the fief of Ranville in 1751, adding that name to their family name. Martial de Guernon- Ranville was born in Caen, Calvados, on 2 May 1787. Under Louis XVI his father was an officer in the \\"black musketeers\\", the musketeers of the military household of the King of France. In 1806 Martial de Guernon-Ranville enlisted in the skirmishers of the Imperial Guard, but was discharged due to myopia. He studied law, and was admitted to the bar in Caen. Guernon-Ranville greeted the first Bourbon Restoration with enthusiasm. During the Hundred Days when Napoleon returned from exile he joined a company of young volunteers who wanted to fight the \\"usurper\\", but instead was sent to Ghent with his company to guard Louis XVIII. In 1820 he was appointed President of the Court of Bayeux. He became Advocate General at Colmar in 1822 and then was Attorney General in Limoges (1824), Grenoble (1826) and Lyon (1829). In his installation speech in this last position he clearly declared himself to be a counter-revolutionary. Minister On 18 November 1829 Guernon-Ranville was appointed Minister for Ecclesiastical Affairs and Public Instruction and Grand Master of the University in the Polignac cabinet. His ordinance of 14 February 1830 showed his wish to improve the quality of primary education by giving credits to the communes, creating training schools for teachers and increasing their salaries. On 2 March 1830 he was elected deputy for Maine-et-Loire as replacement for Fran√ßois-R√©gis de La Bourdonnaye, who had been made a Peer of France. With growing unrest among the deputies, he was against the dissolution of the chamber and against extreme measures. He was reelected on 19 July 1830. He reluctantly signed the reactionary Ordinances on 25 July 1830 that inadvertently caused the July Revolution. Later career Ch√¢teau de Guernon- Ranville Guernon-Ranville left office with the rest of the cabinet on 29 July 1830. After the departure of the royal family, he went to Tours and was arrested at the gates of this city and taken to the Ch√¢teau de Vincennes on the night of August 25‚Äì26. At the trial of Charles X's ministers before the Court of Peers he was defended by Adolphe Cr√©mieux. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and jailed in the Ch√¢teau de Ham. Guernon-Ranville was released on 23 November 1836 when a collective pardon was granted at the instigation of Mol√© ministry, and retired to the Chateau de Guernon-Ranville. The Chateau de Guernon-Ranville had been built at some time in the 18th century, and stayed in the family for almost two centuries. Guernon Ranville altered the chateau considerably. He stayed away from politics but actively participated in the cultural life of Caen as a member of the Academy of Sciences, Arts and Letters from 1841, the Horticultural Society and the Society of Agriculture and Commerce. He died on 30 November 1866 in the Chateau de Guernon-Ranville in the village of Ranville, Calvados. Bibliography Works by Guernon-Ranville include:  * The detailed diary that he kept during his ministry is the most useful surviving guide to the way in which Charles X and his government were thinking in the months that led up to the revolution of 1830.

The song's music video was released on June 12, 2012.  Background The song originated from Joshua Cain, who brought the song to the band late in the recording process, but struggled to expand the idea into what he wanted. The song came together gradually, much like the recording process for Go. The band's bass guitarist, Matthew Taylor, regarding the recording process, says that \\"there's always a certain point for me, and I think Josh too, during recording, we start to sift through every idea we have.\\" Taylor sent Cain a mock keyboard part he had written for \\"True Romance\\", and both decided at the last minute that the track should be recorded and considered for the album. However, drums for the entire album had already been recorded and the group's drummer, Tony Thaxton, was to be leaving town on a plane the very next day. That next morning, two hours before Thaxton's flight, he came into the studio and tracked drums for \\"True Romance\\". Jesse Johnson, the group's keyboard player, acknowledges the absurdity of the task they were putting before Thaxton by saying, \\"You gotta go play another song, that you haven't really heard, and don't know how it goes, and haven't written a part, but go do it. And you have an hour\\". Regarding the meaning of the song, the lead vocalist, Justin Pierre, said \\"'True Romance' is a love song about two people who seemingly don't have much in common except their love for the time they share in the bedroom. In my experience, opposites do attract. And if you can get over the superficialities, you often find you have more in common than you initially thought. Perhaps you even find love.\\" Music video The song's music video, directed by Cain's brother Jesse Caine, is a one shot clip that involved \\"upwards of 30 people behind the scenes, running up and down the street, stopping traffic, moving cars, running around.\\" The video features adult film star Kleio Valentien. The clip took 15 takes to perfect. \\"Growing up in the 1990s, with guys like Spike Jonze always doing these one-take video, it's just always been fun to watch,\\" said Pierre. \\"If you do it well, no one notices how much work goes into it.\\"  Personnel  ;Motion City Soundtrack *Justin Pierre ‚Äì lead vocals, guitar *Joshua Cain ‚Äì guitar, vocals *Jesse Johnson ‚Äì Moog, keyboard *Matt Taylor ‚Äì bass guitar, percussion *Tony Thaxton ‚Äì drums Production *Ed Ackerson ‚Äì producer References External links * Motion City Soundtrack songs 2012 singles 2012 songs Epitaph Records singles ","title":"True Romance (Motion City Soundtrack song)"},{"id":"42509548","text":"PETROU\\\\Man is an American fashion label with European aesthetics and ethnic influences.

His regiment returned to England in the following year; in 1770 he was appointed to the majority, and in 1775 to the lieutenant-colonelcy of that distinguished corps. His zealous attention to all his duties, as commanding officer of the 11th Dragoons, was rewarded in 1781 with the rank of colonel; in 1790, with that of major-general; He was sent by Horse Guards to command the Army Corps of the Irish Midlands with the rank of lieutenant-general based at Castle Martin, County Kildare. During May 1798 he was involved in many rebel encounters around Kilcullen, during the United Irishmen's rebellion when as many as 1,000 of the enemy were under arms. They were beaten at Turnpike Hill, but the British, and Dundas in particular had a nasty initial shock on 23‚Äì24 May at Ballymore. He arranged surrender terms with the rebels who had now amassed on Knockaulin Hill. General Lake, commander-in-chief of British troops in Ireland, then arrived to assist the surrender. He insisted the rebels came down to the avenue of Castlemartin House to surrender (which they refused) and would not be bound by the term ending free quartering on the populace. To avert a breakdown Dundas took it upon himself to go up Knockaulin Hill with two dragoons and the rebel negotiators to take surrender of arms on 27th May, Whit-Monday, ensuring the rebel surrender on humane terms. =Battle of Courtrai= Ralph Dundas was appointed to replace Edward Mansel as commanding officer of The Blues and The Royals, encamped west of Tournai.

The French infantry settled on the village of Willems, and although the French cavalry tried to go to their aid, they were cut off. British artillery bombarded the small French squares, which broke. The British cavalry pursued them over the boggy plain killing 2000 French, taking 400 prisoners, and 14 guns. The British casualties were very light. Early in the battle, Dundas ordered a detachment to capture artillery at the village of Basisieux.

It was a severe defeat for the order which lost its master and several komturs.  Battle  In March 1287, around 1,400 Semigallians attacked the crusader stronghold at Ik≈°ƒ∑ile and plundered nearby lands. Almost immediately after the attack, the master of the Livonian Order, Willekin von Endorp, decided to invade Semigallia in revenge. The crusader army consisted of knights of the Order, units of citizens of Riga, and an unknown number of allied Livonians and Latgalians. The crusader army lost its track and wandered for a few days through forests and marshes in Semigallia. Finally, on 26 March, they made camp near the Garoza river. However, the crusaders were followed by Semigallian scouts, so the location of their camp soon became known to the main Semigallian forces. The next morning, the Semigallian army attacked the crusaders. At first, the battle went with varying success, but slowly the Semigallians gained the initiative and managed to besiege the crusaders' forces. Many of the knights were killed and many more, including a large number of allies, were taken prisoner. The Rhymed chronicle claims that only a few knights managed get back to Riga. Among the casualties were the master of the Livonian Order, Willekin von Endorp, and the Semigallian commander (sources do not mention his name).

Personal History Born in 1917, Crockford was married to W. Hamilton Crockford III and had one daughter and one son and four grandchildren.Virginia Crockford papers, https://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaxtf/view?docId=vcu-cab/vircu00047.xml She had two brothers. Virginia Crockford was a member of the Richmond School Board from 1962 to 1972, and was the Chairman from 1968 to 1972. She was president of the Richmond and the State PTA's, the League of Women Voters, the Central Virginia Health System's Agency, a member of the Virginia Health Planning Agency, a founder of the Volunteers and Juvenile Courts Project, a trustee of the VCU School of Social Work, and active in many other civic, educational and health related organizations in the city, state and nationally.Virginia Crockford‚Äôs obituary on Virginia Obituary and Death Notice Archive (http://www.genlookups.com/va/webbbs_config.pl/read/100) Bringing Sex Education to Virginia Public Schools Before 1954, there were no official State regulations or policies on sex education as a separate aspect of the Virginia public school curriculum. Teachers were not certified for the purpose of offering sex education instruction, nor were there courses in sex education as such approved or offered in Virginia. Instruction on sex education was covered in related courses such as biology or health education.Committee Report on Sex Education in the Public Schools to the Governor and General Assembly of Virginia, Senate Document No. 3. p.2. 1970 At the August 1954 meeting of the Virginia State Board of Education, the Board adopted a regulation requiring public schools and libraries to obtain Board approval before using or circulating any materials related to sex education. Two months later, the Board amended the regulation to specify that textbooks, film and audio visual aid materials, books and pamphlets all required prior approval by the Board. Localities could decide on using sex education materials in their curriculum and could still cover such materials in biology or health courses. In 1963, as increasing interest in teaching sex education generated more requests for Board approval of teaching materials, the Department of Education issued a new 3-step review process. Local school officials would forward materials they had approved to the Department of Education which would decide whether or not to forward the material to the Textbook and Curriculum Committee of the State Board of Education. The Board's decision would then be reported to the local school district. The State followed this procedure for 16 years until 1970 when ‚Äúgrowing public interest in this topic was reflected in the introduction of several bills during the 1970 General Assembly to curtail or regulate sex education in the public schools.‚Äù At its August 1970 meeting, the State Board of Education adopted new regulations, procedures and formal guidelines for sex education in Virginia public schools. One of the most important changes specifies that ‚Äúany instructional program involving sex education should be developed with considerable citizen, parent-teacher association and parental review of the materials to be used and of the type of program to be offered.‚ÄùCommittee Report on Sex Education in the Public Schools to the Governor and General Assembly of Virginia, Senate Document No. 3. p.5. 1970 It also addressed certification standards for teachers of family life and sex education. During this time of considerable progress in advancing sex education as a valuable part of public education, Crockford was serving as Chairman of the Richmond School Board, and although no specifics of her contributions to the effort appear in readily available publications, Richmond public schools did expand and improve sex and family life education offered to its students during her tenure. During this time 15 counties and 12 cities in Virginia had established courses in family life and sex education.SIECUS, Virginia Education Association Position on Family Life and Sex Education p.1 Also, as president of the Richmond and the State PTA's, Crockford led local and state efforts to promote the position of the National Congress of Parents and Teachers on sex education in public schools: ‚ÄúOver and over again the PTA has expressed the belief that sound education about sexuality is basic if children are to understand human development, cope with the stresses and pressures of adolescence in modern America, and become adults capable of successful marriage and responsible parenthood.‚ÄùElizabeth Hundryson, The PTA Magazine, p.20. May 1969 Crockford and many school officials and school board members and others pushing for a sound sex education program in schools faced strong opposition from many right-wing conservative groups. In September, 1968, The Christian Crusade launched a direct mail campaign against family life and sex education. The John Birch Society strongly supported the attack and launched many of its own attacks via various media.SIECUS, A Brief History of the Current Campaign Against Sex Education. pp. 1-2 Crockford and others contended that much of the controversy stemmed from sensationalism and misinformation. Supporting Desegregation of Richmond Schools Crockford was not only a strong proponent of sex education in public schools, she was also an outspoken advocate of desegregation in Richmond schools. She even received death threats for her views. Crockford is credited as a contributor to the book The Color of Their Skin: Education and Race in Richmond Virginia, 1954-89 by Robert A. Pratt.

It is a non-profit NGO, a cultural and linguistic initiative aimed at expanding the everyday use of the Belarusian language, which alongside Russian is one of the two official languages of Belarus. The lessons are held in the gallery of modern art ¬´–é¬ª. The initiative has caught on and has been acclaimed by other regional cities that support the endeavour locally ‚Äì now the courses can be also found in Baranaviƒçy, Hrodna, Babrujsk, Niasvi≈æ, Brest, Maladzieƒçna, Mahilio≈≠, Viciebsk and Homel. The undertaking has also expanded outside Belarus and has an affiliate group in Krak√≥w. Mova Nanova in Minsk has been set up and is hosted by Alesia Litvinouskaja, a linguist, and Gleb Labadzenka, a journalist. The course gathers about 300 students weekly and is attended by people of different background and all walks of life from Belarusian-speaking physicians and software engineers to architects and singers, to writers and actors, to historians and students, to kids and senior citizens. The distinct feature and integral part of each class is special guests. Normally, they are public figures and famous people promoting the Belarusian language and culture, and who see this linguistic environment as an intrinsic part of their daily life. The course is informal by nature, and the teaching process is not governed by strict academic rules. The lessons are divided into different topics like fashion, medicine, relatives, etc., and are split up into several sections ‚Äì vocabulary, grammar, interesting facts, historical or cultural edutainment section, and more.

The regular attendees of the course see this practice as an inseparable step toward strengthening their national identity. Currently regardless of the official status of Belarusian as one of the state languages, its use is mainly restricted to academic and scientific circles, and a range of media channels. Whereas Russian remains the dominant language in public life, among official authorities and on the governmental level as well as in the sphere of education, where the use of Belarusian is equivalent to that of a foreign language. According to the latest census of 2009, around 53% of the population of Belarus consider the Belarusian language to be their mother tongue, however, only about 23% of the respondents say they speak it at home. The language is labelled as vulnerable by UNESCO, which is reflected on its Atlas of the World‚Äôs Languages in Danger. Being brought up in a predominantly Russian linguistic environment, many Belarusian people still experience linguistic interference when they try to speak Belarusian and find it difficult to switch to this language and achieve fluency in an everyday conversation. One of the common reasons that impedes wider adoption of Belarusian beyond the passive utilization in reading and listening is said to be lack of confidence about the level of proficiency that in fluent speech often results in a mixture of both Russian and Belarusian. This blend is often informally called ‚Äútrasianka‚Äù. Therefore, one of the primary aims of the Mova Nanova course is to help those who are aspiring to speak Belarusian regain and develop confidence about using the language in a daily conversation, refresh their existing knowledge, and instill curiosity about further learning of the Belarusian language, culture and history. In Minsk The language courses Mova Nanova first started in Minsk, and now are hosted there by the philologist Alesia Litvinouskaja and the journalist Gleb Labadzenka. The first year of the course numbered 21 lesson, and concluded with a first-year graduation party where special guests such as the music band Handmade and musicians Lavon Volski and Pavel Arakelian were invited. The topics of the first season were Greetings and Wishes, Knights and Battles, Paganism, Medicine, Verbal Tussle and Strong Language, Relatives, Birds, Cinema, Fashion, Humour and Jokes, City and Urbanism, Education, Easter and its Traditions, Theater, Information Technologies and Computer Literacy, Man and Law, Flora, Disabilities and Special Abilities, Fairy Tales. The lessons were visited by many famous Belarusian public figures and cultural personalities, among which were the Handmade band, the members of the knight club \\"Givojt\\" Juras Uscinoviƒç and Uladzimir Liƒçko, Uladzimir Arlo≈≠, Vital Gurko≈≠, Aleh Chamenka, the Sumarok band, the Rahis band, Alaksandr Vinƒçe≈≠ski, the Bosae Sonca band, Ales Kamocki, Viktar ≈†a≈Çkeviƒç, Hanna Chitryk, the band Vuraj, Sa≈°a Varlama≈≠, Andrej Chadanoviƒç, Lavon Volski, the Shuma band, Viaƒçasla≈≠ Rakicki, Mika≈Çaj Pinigin, Zmicer Vajciu≈°keviƒç, Kasia Kamockaja.

The topic was greetings and forms of address. The students discussed the original Belarusian names, and the vocabulary on the topic ‚ÄúRelatives‚Äù was introduced. Then there was reading of several articles from Na≈°a Niva (one of the oldest Belarusian periodicals), dated to the early 20th century. The lesson was concluded with a creative task that required the attendees to finish famous Belarusian proverbs and sayings in their own way. The event was supported by the organizers of the civil campaign ‚ÄúBudzma Belarusami‚Äù. The students received Budzma-branded souvenirs and books from the Union of Belarusian writers. =Hrodna= The introductory presentation of the first lesson in Hrodna on March 14, 2014, gathered more than 100 people.

The presentation was delivered again by the founders of the course ‚ÄúMova Nanova‚Äù Gleb Labadzenka and Alesia Litvinouskaja. Alesia immediately won the hearts of the audience by saying that she was the granddaughter of the renowned Apanas Cychun. While the rest of the students enthusiastically responded to the zeal and witty jokes of Gleb. From the beginning of the presentation the hosts set laid-back and friendly atmosphere that lasted during the two hours of the lesson. The founders of Mova Nanova spoke about the key concept of these courses and demonstrated a few examples of lessons that could be used as the building blocks for the course in the affiliate group in Hrodna. Then a practical followed. The students were divided into groups and again had to finish Belarusian proverbs and sayings. At the end of the presentation the hosts of Mova Nanova in Hrodna were introduced to the audience.

Its main role is to supervise and regulate the entities that make up the Mexican financial system, in order to ensure its stability and proper operation, and to maintain and promote the healthy and balanced development of the financial system as a whole, in protecting the interests of the public. The Chairman since December 2012 is economist Jaime Gonzalez Aguad√© . History and Evolution The need for a regulatory agency of the Mexican financial institutions came together with the creation of the Mexican financial system in the late nineteenth century. The first response to this need was reflected in the Speaking specifically of Mexican financial institutions, the first response to this need was reflected in the Ley General de Instituciones de Cr√©dito, which gave the SHCP responsibility for oversight of the credit system in Mexico. The SHCP appointed auditors to each bank for the purposes of monitoring; however, this created an atmosphere of irresponsibility and inefficiency that led in 1889 to the creation of the so- called \\"Section of Supervision\\" within SHCP, which centralized the functions of monitoring and intervention. Five years later, the Section of Supervision would become an independent agency of the SHCP with the name of Inspector General of Institutions and Insurance Companies; it was renamed Regulatory and Inspection Commission of Credit Institutions in 1915. Finally, the National Banking Commission (CNB) was born on December 24, 1924, as the only watchdog of Mexican banking institutions, with full operational freedom and independence from the SHCP. Due to the evolution of the financial sector operations in Mexico, during the 1950s reform to Ley Federal de Instituciones de Finanzas was executed, which establishes the obligation of the CNB to inspect and monitor surety companies, after which the CNB became the Comisi√≥n Nacional Bancaria y de Seguros (National Commission for Banking and Insurance (1989)). CNBS was split in December of the same year, into CNB and Comisi√≥n Nacional Bancaria de Seguros y Finanzas(National Banking Commission of Insurance and Finance) (Reforma a la Ley Reglamentaria del Servicio P√∫blico de Banca y Cr√©dito) . On April 16, 1946, the Official Gazette announced the creation of the Comision Nacional de Valores (National Securities Commission)(CNV) as an autonomous body whose main function is to approve the offering of securities within the Mexican legal framework and approval / veto of registration to the stock exchanges and the securities to the public offering of traded registered securities. This would lead to the establishment of the Securities Market Law in 1975. Thanks to the Ley de Mercado de Valores (Law of the Stock Market), greater order within the stock market was achieved through the application of auditing and generating new regulations. The LMV gave the market more efficient and simplicity, especially in control of supply, demand and operations; it also allowed greater security, faster transactions, regulation of activities of intermediaries and finally the creation of the Instituto para el Dep√≥sito de Valores (Institute for Deposit of Securities) ( Individual ) (officially SD Individual, SA de CV).Section \\"Antecedentes\\" on Indeval web page (Checked Jan 14, 2014) During 2008 and 2009, the CNBV undertook a process of internal restructuring, approving the Reglamento Interior de la CNBV 2009 (Internal Rules of CNBV 2009) and published in the Official Gazette on August 12, 2009. Currently, monitoring is the main function of the CNBV; it monitors the formation and financial transactions carried out by financial groups, combats organized crime, strengthen measures to ensure that financial institutions implement preventive control mechanisms and audit verifies compliance with legal and administrative requirements, streamlines the information requirements of the Mexican banking system, and investigates breaches of regulations.

Bond experienced the Fraud Squad, the Flying Squad, the Murder Squad, and became the first commander of the newly formed Bomb Squad (later the Anti-Terrorist Branch, now merged into Counter Terrorism Command). His notable achievements in the bomb squad were negotiating the rise of The Angry Brigade, eventually jailing several members. The other major event he negotiated as commander with the Bomb Squad was the Balcombe Street siege, in which two people were taken hostage by four Irish Republican Army members, who demanded a plane to Ireland. Bond, answering the demands, refused saying that the police \\"are not going to make any deals\\". The gunmen surrendered, the event a success for police with no casualties on either side.  Early life  Ernest Radcliffe Bond was born on 1 March 1919 in Barrow-in-Furness, where he lived in a \\"close-knit community\\" at 58 John Street. His father, William Edward Bond, was a shipyard worker, and his mother was Annie Elizabeth Bond n√©e Radcliffe. Bond was an apprentice French polisher after he left school.  Military career  Bond joined the British Army on 16 September 1935, entering the 2nd battalion of the Scots Guards. His objective was to fight in any short engagement that he could, and then to become a police officer. He was sent to Palestine to help with the Arab Revolt. However, his plan was scuppered by the outbreak of World War II, and he stayed with his battalion, serving first in Norway as a sergeant. After a short time in No. 8 (Guards) Commando, where he served in a group of units under Robert Laycock's command fighting in the Middle East in 1941, by that time Bond had been promoted to the rank of sergeant. The unit was disbanded, and he journeyed to North Africa with his original battalion in the Scots Guards, fighting in the Eighth Army. In 1941, still in North Africa, Bond joined \\"L\\" Detachment in the Special Service Brigade, which became David Stirling's Special Air Service. Bond was part of a parachute training mission in Kabrit, Egypt, against the airfields of Gazala and Tmimi. The conditions were \\"atrocious\\", and his aeroplane crashed in desert. He became a prisoner of war for the remainder of the conflict. He was reported to have spent four years in jail in his military career.  Police career  When Bond was released from his imprisonment by the Axis, he was demobilised in 1946 and entered the Metropolitan Police with the warrant number 128434, realising his pre-war ambition. He was 'on the beat' for 2 years, working in Lambeth with 'M' division. His division became 'E' division, patrolling Holborn, when he decided to enter the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in 1948. He experienced another promotion in 1957, to become a Detective Sergeant; \\"he began to develop a reputation for his discerning skill as a detective.\\" Bond rapidly experienced both the Fraud Squad and the Flying Squad; and in 1963 joined the Murder Squad at the rank of Detective Inspector. Bond joined the Bomb Squad, newly formed in January 1971 due to concern over The Angry Brigade. Bond became the unit's first commander on 23 June 1971, being promoted to that position in 1969. The unit served at Tintagel House, and Bond's name was theoretically meant to be kept secret and he should be called 'Commander X', so that he was not bombed, but journalists have since claimed to have known his name within days of his appointment. The press lauded Commander X as a \\"mystery supremo to hunt down the Angry Brigade.\\" The Angry Brigade was a new political group; \\"a small group [around 200] of leftwing radicals and anarchists,\\" who claimed responsibility for about 20 small bombings which began on 20 November 1970, with the bombing of a BBC van. At its formation, the Bomb Squad comprised around 30 men, one third from CID, the rest from Special Branch. The Angry Brigade's decline came in 1971, when various conspirators were arrested. At the 1971‚Äì72 trial, the nine conspirators were denied bail at Clerkenwell Court after Bond opposed the move, and the judge, J Purcell, \\"remanded all nine in custody for a week.\\" There were concerns that the police had \\"over-reached themselves.\\" The Angry Brigade member John Barker later said that \\"the police framed a guilty man,\\" and Bond was called an \\"old-fashioned plod\\" by a defendant. He told the Purcell that \\"I am quite certain that, sooner or later, we would have had somebody killed.\\" Due to his success, in 1972 he was awarded the Queen's Police Medal and promoted to Deputy Assistant Commissioner (Operations). The Irish Republican Army (IRA) also had a bombing campaign ongoing, and in December 1975 Bond \\"saturated\\" the centre of London with plainclothes police officers. Four IRA members took two people hostage in Balcombe Street, following a police chase which involved a shoot out on 7 December. The terrorists called the police, in a call which was routed to Bond; who refused their demands of a plane to fly to Ireland, proclaiming that > \\"They are not going anywhere and they are not getting any plane to Ireland. > We are not going to make any deals at all.\\" The gunmen gave up on 12 December, their surrender sparking fears of reprisals, after what Bond called a \\"rather humiliating episode,\\" Bond \\"masterminded\\" the operation to regain the hostages. He retired the following year, in 1976, and received the Order of the British Empire in the New Year's honours list. Upon his retirement in February 1976, he had served in the police for 30 years, full of \\"exemplary conduct.\\" In his time, Bond received 12 Commissioner's Commendations and 7 for \\"courage, diligence and determination in the course of investigations.\\"  Personal life  Bond married the 23-year-old Mabel Phoebe Isabell n√©e Laming on 29 October 1939, the daughter of a dock worker, Alfred Thomas Laming. They had two sons and two daughters together, who all survived both Ernest and Mabel. When Bond had retired, he indulged his interests in decorating and gardening, and remained a Freemason. Mabel died in 1992, and on 20 November 2003, Ernest died of prostate cancer in Welling; in his home.

It is part of a ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù organisational structure that includes Embrace, a 501(c)(3) non-profit, and Embrace Innovations, a for- profit social enterprise. Embrace‚Äôs first product is an infant warmer to regulate the temperature of vulnerable low-birth-weight and premature infants, that would give premature infants a better chance at survival. A baby born two weeks premature lacks the ability to regulate its own body temperature. The child will likely die if not transferred to an incubator within an hour. With the Embrace Warmer, which is a specially designed polymer blanket, that vital time span becomes 4 hours. The Embrace infant warmers are estimated to have helped over 50,000 babies to date, largely in India, with pilots being conducted in 10 countries. History Embrace was founded in 2008 by Jane Chen, Linus Liang, Naganand Murty and Rahul Panicker. The four founders met as graduate students at Stanford University in a Design for Extreme Affordability course, where they were challenged to design an infant incubator that would cost 1% the price of traditional incubators (about $20,000 in the US). On a 2007 fact-finding trip to Nepal and India, the team realised their design would have to take into account the infrastructural challenges in developing countries, including unreliable power and limited skills of healthcare staff. An initial prototype was developed resembling a baby sleeping bag with a removable, heatable wax insert that prevented hypothermia in premature and low-birth-weight babies, which took into account the limitations of the developing country environment. With initial funding from Stanford BASES Social E-Challenge and Echoing Green, Embrace was registered as a 501(c)(3) non-profit in 2008. In 2009, the team moved to Bangalore, India to further refine their prototypes and explore their intended market. Clinical trials began in 2010. In January 2012, Embrace announced a new hybrid organisational structure. A separate for-profit social enterprise, Embrace Innovations, was spun out of the Embrace 501(c)(3) organisation to handle product design, manufacturing, and sales/distribution, primarily to governments and private clinics in emerging markets. Products The company has developed two versions of the Embrace infant warmer: Embrace Nest, and Embrace Care. The infant warmers are composed of three components: an infant-sized sleeping bag or baby interface, a pouch of phase change material (PCM), and a heater. The pouch, when warmed in the heater and placed into a compartment of the sleeping bag, maintains the World Health Organisation recommended temperature of 37 ¬∞C for a period of up to 8 hours. The product was designed to complement skin-to- skin care. The Embrace Nest, meant for use in hospitals, needs intermittent electricity. It can be used for transportation, in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), or in a maternity ward. The Embrace Care works with no electricity, periodically using hot water, and is intuitive enough to be used by a healthcare worker or a village mother. Embrace has received an ISO 13485 certification for their operations, and obtained a CE mark for their first product, Embrace Nest, meeting international regulatory standards. Compared to traditional incubators and radiant warmers that can cost up to $20,000 and $3,000 respectively, the Embrace infant warmers are priced at $300 (in India). The company is further developing other innovative healthcare products in maternal and child health for developing countries. In 2012, Embrace (nonprofit) began prototyping new program models to integrate the warmer with education on hypothermia and newborn health. In conjunction with its infant warmers, Embrace incorporated side-by-side training to mothers, families, and health care workers on the impact of hypothermia, providing hands-on training on the infant warmer as well as Kangaroo Mother Care, and addressing the root causes of low birth weight and other critical maternal and child health issues. Hybrid Structure While Embrace initially registered as a 501(c)(3) organisation in 2008, a separate organisation, Embrace Innovations, was spun out in 2012 as a for-profit social enterprise focused on the design, manufacturing, and commercial sales of Embrace products. In addition, Embrace Innovations also adopted R&D; responsibilities. The for-profit side manages distribution and sales channels to reach the ‚Äúbottom of the pyramid‚Äù communities that can afford to pay for Embrace products. For each warmer sold, the for-profit arm pays a royalty to the nonprofit, which owns the intellectual property. In turn, Embrace 501(c)(3) organisation sets up partnerships with NGOs and government entities in under-resourced, impoverished communities and distributes infant warmers for free to clinics and hospitals that have limited access to modern technology. This combined approach \\"allows [Embrace] to divide and conquer, to reach a broader range of demographics and areas\\". The for-profit structure was created in order to facilitate the manufacture and distribution of products at scale, as well as to access capital funds needed for these activities. Embrace Innovations closed a Series-A funding round in 2011, with investments from Vinod Khosla‚Äôs Impact Fund and Capricorn Investment Group. =Impact and Expansion= The first Embrace infant warmer was delivered to Little Flower Hospital in Bangalore, India in April 2011, marking the launch of pilot programs in India. In late 2011, Embrace partnered with the American Refugee Committee and Banadir Hospital in Mogadishu, Somalia to implement the first pilot program in Africa. The Embrace Nest was formally introduced to the wider market at the end of 2011. Since 2011, Embrace has built multiple distribution and sales channels, including a global partnership with GE Healthcare. Embrace Innovations has focused its distribution efforts largely in India today, and is currently being adopted in 10 states across India. By 2013, Embrace (nonprofit) had launched 22 programs in 10 countries on 3 continents. Local staff of both Embrace and partner organisations have also provided intensive side-by-side education on hypothermia and newborn health to over 5,000 mothers, family members and health care workers. Awards and Accolades Embrace and its founders have received numerous awards and recognition, including being profiled in The Economist, Wall Street Journal, TED, Time, Forbes, and Fast Company.

The union was dominated by communists, and was suppressed by the government in 1945. Foundation In August 1944 diplomatic relations were established between Iraq and the Soviet Union. The government issued a permit for the railway workers to form a union of their own on September 7, 1944. The founding conference of the union was held in November 1944. Some ten thousand workers took part in the event. Ali Shukr, a Central Committee member of the Iraqi Communist Party, was elected chairman of the Railway Workers Union. April 1945 strike Between April 15 and 30, 1945 the railway workers organized a major strike. The strike erupted in Baghdad, but spread to other cities. The Railway Workers Union had demanded a 30 to 40% salary increase, a demand that was rejected by the British-managed Railways Directorate. The strike was met with heavy-handed repression from the authorities. Seeking to quash the strike the Interior Ministry and the Railways Directorate threatened to replace Iraqi workers with Indian labourers and cut the water supply to the workers' living quarters in Bagdhad. These moves prompted solidarity actions and the spread to the strike to Samawah on April 16, Basra on April 18 and Mosul on April 19. The members of the strike committee were arrested. The Railway Workers Union was banned. However, the strike continued. In the end the Railway Directorate agreed to a 20-30% salary hike. Aftermath of the 1945 strike Unrest amongst the railway workers would continue for another 3 years, with more strikes. The 1945 railway workers strike also inspired other groups, such as port and oil workers, to launch strike actions.

Maura was born in Argentina. We are Catalonia. Country of Conviv√®ncia.\\" Conviv√®ncia is the public policy on social coexistence in Catalonia, Spain; government projects, departments and ordinances promote the principle broadly. Originally, conviv√®ncia was presented as a policy to integrate immigrant populations and build social cohesion following the divisive Spanish Civil War and dictatorship. Today, conviv√®ncia can encompass conflict mediation, policing, civic participation, language policy, public education, civility, public celebrations and the promotion of neighborhood-based initiatives.Projecte de conviv√®ncia.

Pla per a la conviv√®ncia de Vilanova i la Geltr√∫, As the dominant paradigm of social coexistence, conviv√®ncia is the frequent subject of political, scholarly, media and popular discourse. Unlike the cognate Castilian term, convivencia, which refers to an imagined Medieval Iberian past, the Catalan word and policy emerged in the late 1970s and refers to contemporary social life and recent history.Utopian virtues: Muslim neighbors, ritual sociality, and the politics of conviv√®ncia.

Origin and development of Conviv√®ncia  Many Catalan municipal governments include social service divisions dedicated to fostering conviv√®ncia. This Muslim barber has named his shop with the Catalan word for \\"Friendship.\\" This may express the Islamic value of neighborliness, often linked to conviv√®ncia by Muslims in Catalonia. Conviv√®ncia (literally \\"to live together\\")Alberti, Santiago. Diccionari de la Llengua Catalana. Barcelona: Alberti, Editor S.L. is a Catalan term, distinct from the Castilian term, convivencia, the latter primarily referring to the historical and disputed coexistence of Jews, Muslims and Christians in Medieval Iberia.Glick, Thomas F. 1992. Convivencia: An introductory note. In Convivencia: Jews, Muslims and Christians in Medieval Spain, edited by V. Mann, T. Glick and J. Dodds. New York: George Braziller, Inc. 1-10. It was first popularized in reference to contemporary phenomena by former Catalan President Jordi Pujol, in the early years of the return to democracy following the dictatorship of Francisco Franco (1939‚Äì75). As Pujol employed the term, conviv√®ncia signified tolerance and linguistic accommodation between native born Catalans and the Castilian-speaking \\"new Catalans\\" or \\"other Catalans\\" who had migrated from Southern Spain in such numbers as to constitute roughly half of the population of Catalonia.Pujol, Jordi. 1976.

Els altres Catalans. Barcelona: Edicions 62. In subsequent decades, the term became the dominant frame of shared social existence in Catalonia and no longer carried a passive sense of mere tolerance but rather the active engagement of relations between neighbors and of the full expression of cultural pluralism in which there is public space for all traditionsRovira Pascual, Conrad. 2007. Des del minaret. Diari de Vilanova, March 16, p.15. Conviv√®ncia overlaps semantically with the concept of civility (civisme) to the extent that both may refer to mutual respect in the shared use of public space yet there is an important distinction. Civisme is often understood as a top-down, legislative imposition of universal norms over the population whereas conviv√®ncia (while also sometimes being legislated) is perceived as a bottom-up, neighbor-to-neighbor process whereby residents work out solutions to conflicts among themselves.Su√±√©, Ramon. 2006a.

This sense of conflict as productive is an important feature of conviv√®ncia. A municipal plan defines it this way: > \\"We can define conviv√®ncia in the broadest sense of the concept, to live in > the company of others with whom we interact with empathy, sharing, > communication, and the regulation of conflict. One should bear in mind that > when people live together, conflicts arise: this need not be seen as a > problem but rather as an impetus to change. From this definition we > understand conviv√®ncia (active relations between neighbors), in > contradistinction to coexistence (minimal, passively produced relations > between neighbors), and to hostility.\\"  Conviv√®ncia vs multiculturalism: implications for citizenship  In other parts of Europe, or in the US, the mixed societies that result from immigration are often discussed in terms of multiculturalism. The term multiculturalism is predicated on the existence of distinct, sometimes static cultural identities and often provoke debate regarding the conception of human rights as universal or particular to a cultural group.Kymlicka, Will. 1995. The Rights of Minority Cultures. Oxford: Oxford University Press. The rights of these cultural others often hinge on the question of their citizenship. While equivalents for all of these concepts exist in Catalonia, they are not the dominant nor even the legally significant ideas. Catalan law does not acknowledge citizens but rather neighbors (ve√Øns) through the principle of ve√Ønatge administratiu (neighborhood jurisdiction) established by municipal registration (l'empadronament) regardless of citizenship.Padr√≥ municipal d'habitants - Viquip√®dia, l'enciclop√®dia lliure Citizenship is an abstract concept; one may be a citizen of one place yet reside in another but a person can only be a neighbor in one determinant place at a time. Both concepts conviv√®ncia and neighbor emphasize concrete local specificity over disembodied abstraction. And while conviv√®ncia encompasses the relations between natives and newcomers, it also concerns the relations between people of shared origins, therefore de-emphasizing cultural differences.Codi Civil de Catalunya Following these principles, in most Catalan communities, the preferred term for immigrant is \\"nouvingut\\" (newcomer) suggesting the language of hospitality rather than that of social or legal policy. It should be understood that these differences do not guarantee better or different social outcomes for immigrants but rather that these concepts form part of the way Catalans understand their own society in distinct ways.  Conviv√®ncia and Islam  Half of Spain's Muslim population resides in Catalonia providing challenges and opportunities for the application of conviv√®ncia.l'Institut d'Estad√≠stica de Catalunya. 2006. Residents estrangers 2006.Manyer i Farr√©, Josep. 1992. Quan l'Islam truca a la porta: per a una aproximaci√≥ cultural als musulmans de Catalunya. 1 ed. Barcelona: Fundaci√≥ Serveis de Cultura Popular: Editorial Alta Fulla. Catalonia's Muslim leaders, from the imams of local mosques, to Catalonia's first Muslim member of parliament who has published a trilingual book on the subject, have framed conviv√®ncia as consonant with Qu'ranic teachings, or as part of Islamic tradition itself. While tensions between Muslims and non-Muslim communities exist in Catalonia as elsewhere, conviv√®ncia supplies a common frame of shared values as a starting point for dialogue. This is in stark contrast to other parts of Europe where such conflicts may be framed as the \\"clash of civilizations,\\" or the alleged fundamental incompatibility between Islam and secular modernity.The Clash of Ignorance The Nation  References  Public policy by country Public policy ","title":"Conviv√®ncia"},{"id":"42509802","title":"Claudia Michelsen"},{"id":"42509805","text":"Wesleyan Society may refer to: * Wesleyan Assurance Society * Wesleyan Philosophical Society * Fundamental Wesleyan Society See also * Wesley Historical Society ","title":"Wesleyan Society"},{"id":"42509880","text":"The Sauer S 1800 is a family of German four-stroke aircraft engines, certified according to JAR 22-H (CS-22 subpart H), Sauer Flugmotorenbau GmbHCS-22, CS-22 Design and development The engine is based on the Volkswagen air-cooled engine, extensively modified for aircraft use and all the parts are custom made.

During the Wars of the Roses, the dynastic struggle between the rival York and Lancaster branches of the English royal family, Trevers, like most of the Anglo-Irish gentry, supported the Yorkist cause. In 1460 he accompanied Richard, Duke of York to England when York unsuccessfully claimed the English Crown. In 1461, following the Yorkist triumph, Trevers was appointed Master of the Rolls in Ireland by Richard's son, King Edward IV: the office was granted first to Patrick Cogley, but Cogley quickly exchanged it for the more lucrative office of Clerk of the Crown and Hanaper. In 1465 Trevers was entrusted with raising men for the defence of Dublin. He died in 1468.

He managed the Oshawa Generals from 1937 to 1953, and built the team which won seven consecutive OHA championships, and three Memorial Cups. He is the namesake of both the Matt Leyden Trophy, and the Leyden Trophy. Career Leyden was born 1904, and was the first of three boys to parents Robert and Margaret Leyden. He immigrated with his family to Oshawa, Ontario from Hawick, Scotland in 1914 at age 10. Leyden managed the Oshawa Majors from 1928 to 1937, and the Oshawa Generals from 1937 to 1953. Leyden established the Generals dynasty from 1937 to 1944, winning seven consecutive J. Ross Robertson Cups under his leadership. The Generals also won three Memorial Cups, in 1939, 1940, and 1944. As of the 2017 Memorial Cup, Leyden remains one of only three general managers to assemble three Memorial Cup winning teams; the others are Warren Rychel of the Windsor Spitfires, and Bob Brown of the Kamloops Blazers. Leyden was also involved with men's box lacrosse. He managed the Oshawa team to the 1929 Mann Cup title, and was an active member of Oshawa Green Gaels from 1964 to 1971. Leyden served on the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association executive, while he was president of the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) from 1965 to 1967. He was succeeded by Jack Devine as OHA president. Leyden died December 23, 1975, in Oshawa. He was interred at Mount Lawn Cemetery in Whitby, Ontario. He was regarded by Hap Emms as a close friend, an honorable person, and someone who should have been enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame. Honours Leyden's gravestone in Mount Lawn Cemetery in Whitby, Ontario Leyden received the Ontario Hockey Association gold stick award for dedication and service to the sport in 1956, and was made a lifetime member in 1972. The Ontario Hockey League has awarded Matt Leyden Trophy annually since 1972, for the OHL Coach of the Year. In 1973, Leyden received the CAHA Order of Merit. In 1975, the Ontario Hockey League split into east and west division, creating the Leyden division for the eastern teams. The Leyden Trophy was awarded to the winner of the Leyden division until 1994‚Äì95, when the league realigned into three divisions. It is now awarded to the regular season champion of the East division. Oshawa Minor Hockey introduced the Matt Leyden Memorial Award in 1976, as the organization's outstanding player award.

Six of his games attained first-class status, and in these he took 17 wickets and scored 61 runs. Born in Ormskirk, in Lancashire, he was a gentlemen cricketer who played for the Gentlemen of England and various representative teams. Emigrating to Canada, he served in the armed forces during World War I, and was killed in Placaut Wood, France aged 30. Playing career The son of Reverend Henry Frederick Spencer Adams and Ethel Emma Louisa Reid, Adams lived in Congresbury, Somerset in his early years, as recorded in the 1891 census. He lost his mother in 1900. Educated at St. Lawrence College, Ramsgate, he was captain of the First XI there for both cricket, rugby and hockey. While attending Queens College, at Cambridge University, he played a Seniors Match at the invitation of Robert Baily to face an XI created by Charles Lucas. The match, billed as CE Lucas' XI v REH Baily's XI, began on 4 May 1908. Adams, a batsman and bowler of unknown handedness, batted last, scoring four, and took three wickets at the cost of 33 runs. He scored four more in his second innings, and went wickless off three overs as his side took a 61-run victory. Adams went on to make his first-class debut on 25 May against Lancashire. He went wicketless, but managed to score 21 in his seconds innings. Cambridge suffered a 171-run defeat. Cambridge then played a representative XI led by Gerry Weigall, where he took 1/66 in a straightforward victory. Adams did not play another recorded match until May 1910, where he appeared an exhibition game, Etceteras v Perambulators. Adams featured in the latter team, and took a five wicket haul. On 30 May he faced Kent, taking 3/52, and on 6 June he took 2/66 against the Free Foresters. He took his career-best 6/86 against Sussex on 20 June, with three more wickets in the second innings, but went wicketless against the Marylebone Cricket Club a week later in a rain-affected game. On 27 June he made his final first-class appearance, Gentlemen of England v Cambridge University. Playing for the Gentlemen, he took 2/96 and 2/32, and made a pair with the bat ‚Äì two scores of zero. He is recorded as living in Broadstairs in Kent in the 1911 census. He moved to Canada and married Emilie Anderson d'Auquier in 1913, residing near Winnipeg, playing with \\"some success\\" at Winnipeg Cricket Club, according to Wisden. He took part in two games against a touring Australian side in 1913, taking one wicket in the first and 3/62 in the second. Military career Adams enlisted in the armed forces and served in The Rifle Brigade, rising to the rank of lieutenant. Part of the 1st Battalion of the Rifles, he was killed in France in 1918.

Attestation With Nehesy, Nebsenre and Merdjefare, Sekheperenre is one of only four undisputed pharaohs of the 14th Dynasty to have left any attestation beyond the Turin canon, a king list compiled in the early Ramesside period. Indeed, Sekheperenre is attested by a single scarab seal bearing his name. The seal, donated by A. S. Hunt and of unknown provenance, is currently in the Ashmolean Museum. Chronological position Sekheperenre's relative position in the 14th Dynasty is somewhat secured by the Turin canon, which mentions him in column 9, line 16 (Gardiner entry 8.16).Alan Gardiner, editor. Royal Canon of Turin. Griffith Institute, 1959. (Reprint 1988. ) According to the latest reading of the king list by Ryholt, Sekheperenre reigned 2 months and 1 to 5 days. In the previous authoritative study of the Turin canon, Alan Gardiner had read Sekheperenre's reign length as 2 years, but Ryholt established that the number of years attributed to Sekheperenre by the canon was nil. Sekheperenre was preceded by a king whose name is partially lost \\"[...]re\\" and succeeded by Djedkherewre. The seal has a coil pattern, common in the twelfth to fourteenth dynasties and seal typology may be used to provide supporting evidence for the position and dating of Sekheperenre. At the opposite, Sekheperenre's absolute chronological position is debated. According to Egyptologists Kim Ryholt and Darrell Baker, Sekheperenre was the twenty-second king of the 14th dynasty. Ryholt's reconstruction of the early 14th Dynasty is controversial however and other specialists, such as Manfred Bietak and J√ºrgen von Beckerath, believe that the dynasty started shortly before Nehesy c. 1710 BC rather than c. 1805 BC as proposed by Ryholt.

Set in London, the series follows DS Jack Weston, DC Charlie Steele and their senior DI Martha Bellamy of Greater London Police while they investigate different types of cases including murder, attempted murder, missing people, drug overdose, child abuse and sex crime. Most of the show's dialogue is improvised in order to make it seem natural. The actors have a detailed story document and perform from there. The show is filmed within the former London Electricity Building on Cambridge Heath Road, London. The building doubles as Brownall House which features in ITV's comedy series The Job Lot.  Overview  Suspects is set in a London police station. DS Jack Weston, DC Charlie Steele and DI Martha Bellamy investigate murder cases, missing person's reports, drug overdoses etc. Within every episode a crime is solved in a documentary style. For the second series the concept of the series was changed, so that cases are not resolved in a single episode. The actors don't have a script. The plot is described roughly, and actors improvise the dialogue and their reactions. Through this production style the series should be more realistic and investigative. The series hardly deals with the private lives of the investigators, it is about the police work. An episode is shot within two and a half days, which means that one scene is filmed within only 18 minutes. The main cast prepared for the series by taking a police workshop with a retired police officer for several weeks. They learned interview techniques, police terminologies and general day-to-day lingo.

This technique relies on the fact that solid objects have natural frequencies at which they vibrate when mechanically excited. The natural frequency depends on the elasticity, size, and shape of the object‚ÄîRUS exploits this property of solids to determine the elastic tensor of the material. The great advantage of this technique is that the entire elastic tensor is obtained from a single crystal sample in a single rapid measurement. At lower or more general frequencies, this method is known as acoustic resonance spectroscopy.  History  Interest in elastic properties made its entrance with 17th century philosophers, but the real theory of elasticity, indicating that the elastic constants of a material could be obtained by measuring sound velocities in that material, was summarized only two hundred of years later. In 1964, D. B. Frasier and R. C. LeCraw used the solution calculated in 1880 by G. Lam√® and H. Lamb to solve the forward problem, and then inverted it graphically, in what may be the first RUS measurement. Nevertheless, we had to wait the participation of geophysics community, interested in determining the earth's interior structure, to solve also the inverse problem: in 1970 three geophysicists improved the previous method and introduced the term resonant sphere technique (RST). Excited by the encouraging results achieved with lunar samples, one of them gave one of his students the task of extending the method for use with cube shaped samples. This method, now known as the rectangular parallelepiped resonance (RPR) method, was further extended by I. Ohno in 1976. Finally, at the end of eighties, A. Migliori and J. Maynard expanded the limits of the technique in terms of loading and low-level electronic measurements, and with W. Visscher brought the computer algorithms to their current state, introducing the final term resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS).  Theory  Firstly solve the problem of calculating the natural frequencies in terms of sample dimensions, mass, and a set of hypothetical elastic constants (the forward problem). Then apply a nonlinear inversion algorithm to find the elastic constants from the measured natural frequencies (the inverse problem). = Lagrangian minimization = All RUS measurements are performed on samples that are free vibrators. Because a complete analytical solution for the free vibrations of solids does not exist, one must rely on approximations. Finite element methods base on balancing the forces on a differential volume element and calculating its response. Energy minimization methods, on the other hand, determine the minimum energy, and thus the equilibrium configuration for the object. Among the energy minimization techniques, the Lagrangian minimization is the most used in the RUS analyses because of its advantage in speed (an order of magnitude smaller than the finite-element methods). The procedure begins with an object of volume V, bounded by its free surface S. The Lagrangian is given by L =\\\\int_V ( KE - PE ) dV (1) where KE is the kinetic energy density KE =\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{i} \\\\rho \\\\omega^2 u_i^2 (2) and PE is the potential energy density PE =\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{i,j,k,l} c_{i,j,k,l} \\\\frac{du_i}{dx_j} \\\\frac{du_k}{dx_l} (3) Fig. 1: Computer-generated illustrations of some normal modes of vibrations for a rectangular parallelepiped sample. Here, u_i is the ith component of the displacement vector, œâ is the angular frequency from harmonic time dependence, c_{i,j,k,l} is a component of the elastic tensor, and œÅ is the density. Subscripts i, j, etc., refer to Cartesian coordinate directions. To find the minimum of the Lagrangian, calculate the differential of L as a function of u, the arbitrary variation of u in V and on S. This gives: \\\\delta L =\\\\int_V \\\\Bigl\\\\\\\\{ \\\\sum_i \\\\Bigl[ \\\\rho \\\\omega^2 u_i - \\\\sum_{j,k,l} c_{i,j,k,l} \\\\frac{\\\\delta^2 u_k}{\\\\delta x_j \\\\delta x_l} \\\\Bigr] \\\\delta u_i \\\\Bigr\\\\\\\\} dV - \\\\int_S \\\\Bigl\\\\\\\\{ \\\\sum_i \\\\Bigl[ \\\\sum_{j,k,l} \\\\vec n c_{i,j,k,l} \\\\frac{\\\\delta u_k}{\\\\delta x_l} \\\\Bigr] du_i \\\\Bigr\\\\\\\\} dS (4) Because u_i is arbitrary in V and on S, both terms in square brackets must be zero. Setting the first term equal to zero yields the elastic wave equation. The second square bracketed term is an expression of free surface boundary conditions; \\\\vec n is the unit vector normal to S. For a free body (as we assume it), the latter term sums to zero and can be ignored. Thus the set of u_i that satisfies the previously mentioned conditions are those displacements that correspond to œâ being a normal mode frequency of the system. This suggests that the normal vibrations of an object (Fig. 1) may be calculated by applying a variational method (in our case the Rayleigh-Ritz variational method, explained in the next paragraph) to determine both the normal mode frequencies and the description of the physical oscillations. To quote Visscher, getting both equations from the basic Lagrangian is \\"a mathematical fortuity that may have occurred during a lapse in Murphy's vigilance\\". = Rayleigh-Ritz variational method = The actuation of this approach requires the expansion of the u_i in a set of basis functions appropriate to the geometry of the body, substituting that expression into Eq. (1) and reducing the problem to that of diagonalizing a N√óN matrix (eigenvalue problem). The stationary points of the Lagrangian are found by solving the eigenvalue problem resulting from Eq. (4), that is, \\\\omega^2 E a = \\\\Gamma a (5) where a are the approximations to the motion expanded in a complete basis set, E comes from the kinetic energy term, and Œì comes from the elastic energy term. The order of the matrices is ~10^3 for good approximations. Equation (5) determines the resonance frequencies from the elastic moduli. = The inverse problem = The inverse problem of deducing the elastic constants from a measured spectrum of mechanical resonances has no analytical solution, so it needs to be solved by computational methods. For the indirect method, a starting resonant frequency spectrum, f_n^{cal} (n=1,2,...) is calculated using estimated values for the elastic constants and the known sample dimensions and density. The difference between the calculated and measured resonance frequency spectrum, f_n^{mea} (n=1,2,...) is quantified by a figure of merit function, F =\\\\sum_n w_n (f_n^{cal} - f_n^{mea})^2 (6) where w_n (n=1,2,...) are weight coefficients reflecting the confidence on individual resonance measurements. Then, a minimization of the function F is sought by regressing the values of all the elastic constants using computer software developed for this process.  Measurements  Fig. 2: Schematic of the two transducer resonant ultrasound spectroscopy set up. The most common method for detecting the mechanical resonant spectrum is illustrated in Fig. 2, where a small parallelepiped-shaped sample is lightly held between two piezoelectric transducers. One transducer is used to generate an elastic wave of constant amplitude and varying frequency, whereas the other is used to detect the sample's resonance. As a frequency range is swept, a sequence of resonance peaks is recorded. The position of these peaks occurs at the natural frequencies f_n (from which the elastic constants are determined) and the quality factor Q (a measure of how narrow the resonance is) provides information about the dissipation of elastic energy. The presence of several transducers is needed to minimize the loading of the sample, in order to have the best possible match between the resonance frequencies and the natural ones. This results in a measurement accuracy on the order of 10%, whereas the measurement precision of frequency is always on the order of a few parts per million. Unlike in a conventional ultrasonic measure, in a method that resonates the sample a strong coupling between the transducer and the sample is not required, because the sample behaves as a natural amplifier. Rather, keeping at minimum the couple between them, you get a good approximation to free surface boundary conditions and tend to preserve the Q, too. For variable-temperature measurements the sample is held between the ends of two buffer rods that link the sample to the transducers (Fig. 3) because the transducers must be kept at room temperature. In terms of pressure, on the contrary, there is a limit of only a few bars, because the application of higher pressures leads to dampening of the resonances of the sample. = Samples = RUS can be applied to a great range of samples sizes, with a minimum in the order or a few hundred micrometers, but for the measurement of mineral elasticity it is used on samples typically between 1 mm and 1 cm in size. The sample, either a fully dense polycrystalline aggregate or a single crystal, is machined in to a regular shape. Theoretically any sample shape can be used, but you obtain a substantial saving in computational time using rectangular parallelepiped resonators (RPR), spherical or cylindrical ones (less time savings with cylinders). Fig. 3: The sample assembly for a RUS variable-temperature measurement. Since the accuracy of the measure depends strictly on the accuracy in the sample preparation, several precautions are taken: RPRs are prepared with the edges parallel to crystallographic directions; for cylinders only the axis can be matched to sample symmetry. RUS is rarely used for samples of lower symmetry, and for isotropic samples, alignment is irrelevant. For the higher symmetries, it is convenient to have different lengths edges to prevent a redundant resonance. Measurements on single crystals require orientation of the sample crystallographic axes with the edges of the RPR, to neglect the orientation computation and deal only with elastic moduli. Polycrystalline samples should ideally be fully dense, free of cracks and without preferential orientation of the grains. Single crystal samples must be free of internal defects such as twin walls. The surfaces of all samples must be polished flat and opposite faces should be parallel. Once prepared, the density must be measured accurately as it scales the entire set of elastic moduli. = Transducers = Unlike all other ultrasonic techniques, RUS ultrasonic transducers are designed to make dry point contact with the sample. This is due to the requirement for free surface boundary conditions for the computation of elastic moduli from frequencies. For RPRs this requires a very light touch between the sample's corners and the transducers. Corners are used because they provide elastically weak coupling, reducing loading, and because they are never vibrational node points. Sufficiently weak contact ensures no transduced correction is required.  Applications  As a versatile tool for characterizing elastic properties of solid materials, RUS has found applications in a variety of fields. In geosciences one of the most important applications is related to the determination of seismic velocities in the Earth's interior. In a recent work, for example, the elastic constants of hydrous forsterite were measured up to 14.1 GPa at ambient temperature. This study showed that aggregate bulk and shear moduli of hydrous forsterite increase with pressure at a greater rate than those of the corresponding anhydrous phase. This implies that at ambient conditions VP and VS of hydrous forsterite are slower than those of anhydrous one; conversely, with increasing pressure, and consequently depth, VP and VS of hydrous forsterite exceed those of anhydrous one. In addition hydration decreases the VP/VS ratio of forsterite, the maximum compressional wave azimuthal anisotropy and the maximum shear wave splitting. These data help us to constrain Earth's mantle composition and distinguish regions of hydrogen enrichment from regions of high temperature or partial melt.

It was initially projected to shorten the railway line connecting Ankara with Istanbul. Background The construction of Aya≈ü Tunnel was planned in 1943 as part of a higher-speed rail service project. The -long tunnel would enable to shorten the distance of between Istanbul and Ankara about to . The travel time would reduce from seven-and-half hours to two-and-half hours. After 33-years of suspension, the project came into force in 1976 when groundbreaking took place in presence of Prime Minister S√ºleyman Demirel on the western entrance at Aya≈ü side of the mountain. The next year in 1977, Deputy Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan initiated the digging work at the tunnel's opposite entrance in the east near Erkeksu village. At that time, it was announced that the construction of the -long tunnel would be completed in seven years. During the time after the 1980 military coup, the construction works at the tunnel did not progress as expected although it was taken several times in consideration by the government. Prime Minister Turgut √ñzal, who came into power following the 1983 general election, was a pro-highway and an anti-railway politician. So, he stopped the building of the railway tunnel for a long time. In the meantime, the construction of the Istanbul‚ÄìAnkara motorway began. After completion of the motorway, discussions flamed about the railway systems that led to the remembrance of the Aya≈ü Tunnel. In 1987, it was decided to update the studies of the Aya≈ü Tunnel Project. Bidding consortiums from France, Germany, Italy, United Kingdom and Belgium submitted tenders proposing project's realization by financing through foreign loan instead of unattractive build-operate- transfer method. The tunnel project resumed when S√ºleyman Demirel became prime minister again in 1991. The construction works accelerated with government's funding, however these efforts did not suffice to complete the -long tunnel. The tunnel could be bored in a length of until the Justice and Development Party (AKP) took over the government following the 2002 general election. At that time, the total expenditures amounted to 701 million. The Minister of Transport, Maritime and Communication Binali Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m stopped the high-speed rail project of Istanbul-Ankara and hence the Aya≈ü Tunnel construction. The entrance to the tunnel was closed, and ashes were dumped in pile in front of the tunnel's both entrances. For the water management of the groundwater that seeped into the tunnel, 200‚Äì300 thousand had to be spent annually. The total cost for the tunnel's maintenance amounted to 2.9 million between 2001 and 2012. Current state In 2010, the Department of Railways, Harbors and Airports (DLH) of the ministry undertook studies on the high-speed rail project between Ankara and Aya≈ü, the -long section of the initial Ankara‚ÄìIstanbul railway line project, which had come to standstill. That project had already undergone a revision to a line between Ankara and Arifiye only. The new project envisaged the rehabilitation of the railway line section suitable for a speed of . The budget for the extra works was given with around 150 million. The opening of the line was seen as important for the development of tourism in the region, and for an economic transportation of one-million tons of trona mineral annually from √áayƒ±rhan mine. The study found out that the railway infrastructure between √áayƒ±rhan and Sincan did not meet the standard requirements of high-speed rail. It appeared that the cross section of the tunnel was insufficient to withstand the aerodynamic pressure of the high-speed rail even though the other railway infrastructure would have been improved. The ministry announced in February 2013 that studies are being conducted for the resume of boring work for the remaining section of the tunnel. With the realization of the tunnel project and opening of the railway line, a railway station will be built in Beypazarƒ± town. Technical details Nurol Construction began the construction of the tunnel in 1976. In 2012, the same company took over the project's realization. When completed, the Aya≈ü Tunnel will be Turkey's longest railway tunnel with its length of . The lined inner diameter of the tunnel is . Its cross section is horseshoe shaped. The tunnel's -long section is constructed by cut-and-cover method while for the main part of the New Austrian Tunnelling method was applied.

The organization was founded by a group of Jewish members of the Iraqi Communist Party in 1945. Foundation The petition to found the Anti-Zionist League was signed by eight individuals from Baghdad on September 12, 1945. The government approved the petition on March 16, 1946. Whilst the Communist Party was illegal at the time and the National Liberation Party (considered a front organization for the Communist Party) had been refused legal registration, the Iraqi government allowed the Anti-Zionist League to operate as a legal organization. The reason is said to have been that the government hoped to use the organization to represent Iraqi Jews towards the Anglo-American Commission of Inquiry on Palestine. Political line The Anti-Zionist League sought to propagate amongst the Iraqi population to avoid confounding Jews with Zionism, as a measure to confront \\"communal hatred\\". Zionism was, according to the organization, a colonialist phenomenon. The Anti-Zionist League called for a fully independent Palestine, an Arab democratic government, end to land transfers to Zionists and prohibition of Zionist migration. According to the Anti-Zionist League British and U.S. imperialism was responsible for the rise in sectarian violence and nationalism. Leadership Amongst the founders of the organization were Yahuda Siddiq (Central Committee member of the Communist Party) and Masru Qattan and Yusuf Zalluf. Yusuf Zhilkha headed the organization. Zakki Basim, a non-Jew, acted as the liaison between the organization and the Central Committee of the Communist Party. Membership The organization was dominated by young Jewish communists. Jewish members of the Communist Party were required by the party to join the organization (those who didn't could be accused of Zionist leanings). The membership of the Anti- Zionist League was, however, not exclusively Jewish and communist. There were also some Christian and Muslim members, and some of its members were Progressive Nationalists. Al-'Usbah It published a daily newspaper al-'Usbah (ÿßŸÑÿπÿµÿ®ÿ©, 'The League'), which had a circulation of 6,000 copies. Activities During its three months of legal existence, the Anti-Zionist League organized twenty-two public meetings. In Baghdad up to 5,000 people could take part some of these meetings. Two public meetings were held in Basra, with thousands of participants. Ban Al-'Usbah was banned in June 1946, shortly after its foundation. The organization was declared illegal by the Iraqi government in July 1946. Members of the organization were arrested and charged with the crime of Zionism.

It publishes Northern Gardener, a bi-monthly magazine that is the only U.S. publication devoted exclusively to gardening in Hardiness Zones 3-5. Its \\"Garden-in-a-Box\\" program provides raised bed garden boxes, along with soil and vegetable plants, to low-income families and schoolchildren in the greater Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota area and elsewhere in Minnesota. \\"Minnesota Green\\" is a MSHS program that coordinates donations of plant material from growers, garden centers, and individuals to public space and community gardens. MSHS offers classes year-round on gardening subjects. MSHS currently has 10,000 members and subscribers to its publication. History MSHS was founded in 1866 as the Minnesota Fruit Growers Association during a meeting of orchard owners at the Minnesota State Fair held in Rochester, Minnesota. The original purpose of this group was to share information on how to successfully grow apples and other fruit in Minnesota. In 1868, the name of the organization was changed to the Minnesota Horticultural Society, and in 1872 the Society took over management of the horticulture department at the Minnesota State Fair. In 1873, the Society incorporated under the general statutes of the state of Minnesota as the Minnesota State Horticultural Society. That same year, the Minnesota legislature approved an act that provided funds to produce and distribute 2000 copies of the MSHS annual reports from 1866-1873, and further provided an appropriation for distribution of future annual reports to members. In 1894, the Society began publishing its transactions in a monthly magazine called The Minnesota Horticulturist.W.H. Alderman, Development of Horticulture on the Northern Great Plains, Institute of Agriculture-University of Minnesota 1962 In 1878, MSHS secured passage of a legislative act establishing the Minnesota Fruit Farm, an experiment station in Minnetonka, MN designed for breeding new varieties of hardy fruits adapted to Minnesota‚Äôs climate. This was the first tax-supported fruit breeding station in the U.S. The station‚Äôs superintendent was Peter Gideon, creator of the Wealthy apple. In 1883, the Society established its own system of experiment stations for growing seedlings and testing new varieties of fruit trees, with various stations created throughout Minnesota. In 1919 the Society moved its headquarters from Minneapolis to the St. Paul campus of the University of Minnesota.W.H.

Under a Defined Contribution Health Plan the employee is responsible for researching and purchasing his or her own insurance policy. Defined contribution health plans are an alternative to traditional employer-sponsored group health insurance plans. A defined contribution health plan by itself is not a health insurance plan, but rather a health benefits strategy. Employer contributions can be made on a tax-free basis when offered under a qualifying plan such as a Section 105 Medial Reimbursement Plan. History Similar to a defined contribution plan used by employers to contribute to their employees' retirement savings, defined contribution health plans allow employers to avoid uncertainty by fixing future obligations. Defined Contribution Health Plans have in recent years become a viable method for offering benefits as individual health insurance plans have become more widely available under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). Industry experts expect that in the coming decade there will be a shift to defined contribution health benefits plans, similar to the recent shift in retirement plans from defined benefit to defined contribution. Advantages * Expense Management: Employers can set and predict employee health benefit costs * Administration Time: Employer setup and administration is generally handled by a third party, minimizing the use of employer resources * Employee Choice: Employees are able to choose an individual plan that offers the level of coverage and network that they prefer References External links *Health Insurance Comparison Healthcare in the United States Health insurance Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ","title":"Defined contribution health benefits"},{"id":"42510220","text":"Pumpkin dessert may refer to: *Pumpkin pie *Kabak tatlisi, a Turkish cuisine dish made with pumpkin *Filh√≥s, a traditional Christmas dessert in Portugal often made with pumpkin *Zuccotto (\\"little pumpkin\\"), an Italian cuisine dessert made using a pumpkin shaped mold ","title":"Pumpkin dessert"},{"id":"42510233","title":"2014‚Äì15 Memphis Tigers men's basketball team"},{"id":"42510239","text":"Benjam√≠n Gallegos Soto (22 April 1960 ‚Äì 27 November 2018) was a Mexican politician affiliated with the National Action Party.

He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on June 26, 2008, and took the oath of office as NCUA Chairman on July 29, 2008. Fryzel served as NCUA Chairman for just over a year before assuming his seat as one of three voting members on the NCUA Board. Serving as the agency liaison to the National Association of State Credit Union Supervisors (NASCUS), a professional regulators' association promoting the safety and soundness of state-charted credit unions, Board Member Fryzel worked with the association to keep state supervisors abreast of changing rules and policies at NCUA and to continue the strong working relationship between NCUA and state regulators. Having served as Director of the Illinois Department of Financial Institutions, whose responsibility included the regulation of state chartered credit unions, Fryzel utilized his understanding of the importance of state credit unions supervisors to work with NCUA to ensure an open line of communication existed between all parties and facilitate the sharing of best practices that would ensure effective regulation and supervision for the credit union industry.NASCUS Stateline, \\"NASCUS Shaping Comments on Proposed Additional NCUA Corporate Regulations.\\" 2010 http://nascus.org/publications/stateline/Stateline-Q4-2010.pdf During his time on the NCUA Board, Fryzel encouraged a move toward less government and reduced regulations for credit unions across the country.

It was released in the United Kingdom on June 9, 2014 by Capitol Records as the second single from the record. The song was written and produced by Ariel Rechtshaid and Justin Raisen, with additional songwriting provided by Ferreira, Daniel Nigro, and Jordan Benik. \\"I Blame Myself\\" is a synth-pop song, in which Ferreira acknowledges that she is responsible for her public image. Contemporary music critics commended \\"I Blame Myself\\" in their reviews of Night Time, My Time, and placed particular praise on its production. An accompanying music video for the track was filmed in Compton, California and directed by Grant Singer; it was premiered through Ssense on April 16, 2014. It depicts Ferreira as a gang leader, who is called in to settle a conflict between rivaling groups. She has performed the track on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in April 2014. Background \\"I Blame Myself\\" was co-written by Ariel Rechtshaid (pictured), who additionally assisted with the songwriting and production of each track on Night Time, My Time. In February 2014, it was reported that \\"Boys\\" would be serviced as the second single from Night Time, My Time, following its lead single \\"You're Not the One\\" which had been premiered in September 2013. However, Capitol Records instead released the song as a free digital download in the United Kingdom on March 1, preceding the launch of Night Time, My Time in the country. \\"I Blame Myself\\" was confirmed as the official second single from the record in April, while Ferreira was filming its accompanying music video. \\"I Blame Myself\\" was written and produced by Ariel Rechtshaid and Justin Raisen, with additional songwriting provided by Ferreira, Daniel Nigro, and Jordan Benik. Rechtshaid and Raisen additionally collaborated for the drums. Individually, Rechshaid contributed vocal production, while Raisen was responsible for recording, Pro Tools engineering, additional vocals, synthesizers, and mixing. Mereki Beach provided additional vocals for the track, while Jeremiah Raisen assisted during its production. Ferreira commented that she had co-written the track during summer 2013; she sings \\"10 years old without a voice / I feel like nothing's really changed / Now I'm just a little older\\" during the second verse, which she revealed was inspired by a two-year period in which she did not speak because she felt like she had had nothing to offer. Composition Drawing from synth-pop music, \\"I Blame Myself\\" incorporates minimalist production elements with styles commonly seen in new wave music. Distinguished as the \\"poppiest\\" track from Night Time, My Time, its lyrics see Ferreira accepting that her behavior contributes to the public image she is given by the media; during the chorus, she states \\"I just want you to realize I blame myself for my reputation.\\" \\"I Blame Myself\\" was assumed to have been inspired by the \\"anthemic pop fizz\\" from her breakthrough single \\"Everything Is Embarrassing\\" from her second extended play Ghost (2012). Jenn Pelly from Pitchfork implied that \\"I Blame Myself\\" referenced the struggles Ferreira faced while creating her long-delayed debut studio album; Pelly suggested that the track was inspired by her frequent conflicts with her record label during production of the project, and added that it \\"lays out the emotional core\\" of her process. Jillian Mapes from the same publication assumed that Ferreira crafted the song in response to being labeled a \\"socialite [and] Forever 21 model\\" and receiving criticism after her drug arrest in September 2013, which she expected would highlight that her side projects \\"have nothing to do with the kind of songs Ferreira writes these days\\". \\"I Blame Myself\\", in addition to the tracks \\"24 Hours\\" and \\"Love in Stereo\\", blend \\"tenderized vocal hooks [and] chiming synth melodies\\", which reminded Lauren Martin from Fact of 1980s music. With his similar observation, Dan Keenan from Impact noted that the \\"chiming synths\\" that Martin recognized developed into the \\"undeniably cathartic\\" refrain. Critical reception \\"I Blame Myself\\" received generally favorable reviews from contemporary music critics. Writing for The A.V. Club, Annie Zaleski called the track the \\"most stunning song\\" from Night Time, My Time; she commended Ferreira's \\"confident\\" vocal delivery and the \\"strident tone\\" of the recording, which Zaleski felt was \\"deeply affecting.\\" Dan Keenan from Impact felt that its lyrics showcased that pop music is not always equivalent with insincerity. Writing for Pitchfork, Carrie Battan felt that \\"I Blame Myself\\" sounded like \\"an uptempo beast\\" that deserved to be successful. Jordan Sargent from Spin felt that \\"I Blame Myself\\" positively exemplified a \\"darkness\\" among the stand-out tracks from the record, which he credited to having her adolescence \\"drained away by airplane flights, photo shoots, and useless recording sessions\\". The New York Times Jon Caramanica was unsure why Ferreira \\"[painted] such a dark picture of herself\\" with the lyrics, and felt that the self-punishment was unnecessary given the strength of \\"I Blame Myself\\" and Night Time, My Time overall. John Preston from Polari believed that the track was a worthy substitute for fans that \\"mourn the overall departure\\" of the mainstream pop sound of Ferreira's 2010 single \\"One\\", and raved that it was an example of \\"airy and gleaming brilliance\\". Two critics from Pitchfork reviewed \\"I Blame Myself\\" separately from Night Time, My Time. Jenn Pelly ranked the track as the twelfth-best song released in 2013. She spoke favorably of its lyrical content, commending the chorus lyrics \\"How could you know what it feels like to fight the hounds of hell?\\" and \\"You think you know me so well\\" for painting Ferreira as an exemplar for \\"bullied high school weirdos\\", and appreciating that the lines \\"I know it's not your fault / That you don't understand / I blame myself\\" for acknowledging her own wrongdoings with the intention of starting anew. Jillian Mapes complimented the \\"bluntness\\" that was delivered throughout the song, and suggested that the track had \\"anthem potential\\". She praised the verses for verbalizing self-confidence issues that are often associated with young women, with particular acclaim being placed on the lines \\"I‚Äôm just a face without a choice / Trust you‚Äôd never like to guess what I think above the shoulders.\\" She concluded her review by noting that the song should be recognized as a \\"declaration of force [and] a song about the power of vulnerability\\" rather than confusing it for an \\"admission of weakness\\". Music video Ferreira (center) performing with African American background dancers in the music video for \\"I Blame Myself\\". An accompanying music video for \\"I Blame Myself\\" was filmed in Compton, California and directed by Grant Singer. During an interview with Idolator, Ferreira commented that \\"I can't really give too many details about it yet, but I shot it in L.A. with Grant Singer, who does all my other videos. And my family‚Äôs in it.\\" A 15-second preview of the project was released on April 14, 2014, while the final product was premiered through the online retailer Ssense on April 16, 2014. It was the first of several \\"shoppable\\" music videos released through the retailer, in partnership with London magazine System. The clip was inspired by the visuals for 1990s hip hop music and the catalog of Michael Jackson, which Ferreira revealed \\"inspire me and played a big part of my childhood.\\" The video depicts an ongoing conflict between gangs, which Ferreira attempts to remedy upon her arrival; she is eventually taken in for questioning by law enforcement, although she resists her arrest and later escapes from jail. She commented that its concept was inspired by real events, and elaborated that \\"people always ask me questions about certain things, and it's kind of like my response.\\" Jeremy Gordon from Pitchfork interpreted Ferreira's commentary to be referencing her arrest in September 2013, in which she was charged with possession of ecstasy. Ferreira was criticized on social media networks for allegedly objectifying African American people in the music video, with whom she was seen dancing with during several scenes interspersed throughout the clip. On her Facebook account, Ferreira commented that \\"I never have and never will look at any human being as a prop\\" and criticized false assumptions of the \\"rich little white girl exploiting the black people and the ghetto\\". Live performances Having appeared as the musical guest that evening, Ferreira performed \\"I Blame Myself\\" on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on April 5, 2014. She was dressed in a sequined blazer, a white shirt, black shorts, a black tie, and sunglasses. Ferreira stood in place while singing the track; the onstage visuals consisted of several blue and red strobe lights. Having taken place before the music video was made publicly available, she revealed that the visuals for the song had been filmed and would be released shortly.

Star Paving Company, 51 Cal. 2d 409 (1958), was a California Supreme Court case in which the court held that a party who has detrimentally relied on an offer that is revoked prior to acceptance may assert promissory estoppel to recover damages. Background William A. Drennan, a general contractor, had gotten a bid from Star Paving, a subcontractor for a construction job and had included Star Paving's bid number in his total bid. Drennan won the contract to build the Monte Vista Elementary School for the Lancaster School District based on that bid. Subsequently, Star Paving contacted him to say that its initial bid had been approximately $7000 short, and that it would not be able to complete the project for the amount of money it had previously specified. After finding an alternative subcontractor to complete the job, Drennan sued Star Paving for the difference between its bid and the cost. Opinion of the Court Judge Roger J. Traynor, writing for the California Supreme Court, held that the plaintiff's reliance on defendant's bid, as well as defendant's failure to indicate that the bid was revocable before acceptance, meant that defendant was responsible for providing the service at the price initially specified. Impact In contracts courses this case is often contrasted with James Baird Co. v. Gimbel Bros., a 1933 case with similar facts from the Second Circuit decided by Judge Learned Hand. Hand held that an offeror was free to revoke the offer prior to acceptance; twenty- five years later, when the doctrine of promissory estoppel had found wider acceptance, Traynor held that the offer was irrevocable once the offeree had relied upon it.

Regents of the University of California60 Cal.2d 92, 383 P.2d 441 (1963) was a leading case in California that established a persuasive six- factor test that helps guide courts to decide when a contract relates to the \\"public interest.\\" Specifically, California courts had a history of holding exculpatory liability waivers within contracts to be valid only if they did not involve the \\"public interest.\\" This case history arose in relation to Cal. Civ. Code ¬ß1668, a statute that states \\"All contracts which have for their object, directly or indirectly, to exempt anyone from responsibility for his own fraud, or willful injury to the person or property of another, or violation of law, whether willful or negligent, are against the policy of the law.\\" Cal. Civ. Code ¬ß 1668. At the time, it was difficult to gauge exactly what the courts meant by interpreting this statute to apply fervently to contracts \\"in the public interest.\\" Tunkl helped clarify this, though there is still a debate as to how many of the six factors must be met, or whether certain factors should be read to be subservient to others. According to Tunkl, the six factors that determine, in the instance, whether a contract relates to the public interest are: (1) It concerns a business of a type generally thought suitable for public regulation. (2) The party seeking exculpation is engaged in performing a service of great importance to the public, which is often a matter of practical necessity for some members of the public. (3) The party holds himself out as willing to perform this service for any member of the public who seeks it, or at least for any member coming within certain established standards. (4) As a result of the essential nature of the service, in the economic setting of the transaction, the party invoking exculpation possesses a decisive advantage of bargaining strength against any member of the public who seeks his services. (5) In exercising a superior bargaining power the party confronts the public with a standardized adhesion contract of exculpation, and makes no provision whereby a purchaser may pay additional reasonable fees and obtain protection against negligence. (6) Finally, as a result of the transaction, the person or property of the purchaser is placed under the control of the seller, subject to the risk of carelessness by the seller or his agents. If a contract both meets these factors and includes liability waivers, it may be held to be invalid and unenforceable as a matter of law and policy. Facts The University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center, a research and education hospital, admitted Hugo Tunkl for treatment of a condition related to a particular condition under study at the time. As a condition of being admitted for treatment, the hospital required that Tunkl sign a contract that included the following provision: \\"RELEASE: The hospital is a nonprofit, charitable institution. In consideration of the hospital and allied services to be rendered and the rates charged therefor, the patient or his legal representative agrees to and hereby releases The Regents of the University of California, and the hospital from any and all liability for the negligent or wrongful acts or omissions of its employees, if the hospital has used due care in selecting its employees.\\" Tunkl signed and was admitted for treatment. He later brought suit against the Medical Center to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have resulted from the negligence of two of his treating physicians. Mr. Tunkl died after the suit was brought, and his wife, as the executrix of his estate, was substituted as plaintiff in the action. Legal issue When a contract including a broad release from future negligence liability is imposed as a condition for treatment at a charitable hospital, is the contract void as a matter of public policy, such that an action may be brought against the hospital for malpractice or personal injury resulting from treatment? Holding Yes. Public policy dictates that certain waivers are void as a matter of public policy if they relate to the public interest. The policy behind this law is straightforward, even though its application to various circumstances has been up for debate. The policy in most states, including California, is that every party entering into a contract must do so at his or her own risk, as each party is assumed to be entering the contract voluntarily and receiving due consideration as part of the bargain. Here, the court recognizes that there are some instances where a person may enter a contract less-than-voluntarily, or without receiving adequate consideration: situations in which that person needs an essential service such as medical care. The court relates this to the public interest because it is a service of a type that \\"each member of the public, presently or potentially, may find essential to him,\\" which raises the possibility that \\"he faces, despite his economic inability to do so, the prospect of a compulsory assumption of the risk of another's negligence.\\" In other words, when someone needs a service, they find themselves being forced to shoulder another person's risks at their own expense, i.e. by waiving doctors from negligence liability as was done here. The Tunkl court states that this is somewhat unfair, and thus although \\"The public policy of this state has been, in substance, to posit the risk of negligence upon the actor; in instances in which this policy has been abandoned, it has generally been to allow or require that the risk shift to another party better or equally able to bear it, not to shift the risk to the weak bargainer.\\" Tunkl stands for the notion that a person should not be forced to shoulder certain contractual risks, especially if those risks are of the kind that the rest of the general \\"public\\" will likely face at some point in their lives.

In the following rounds, Inter beat in order: Monaco (4‚Äì1 aggregate), Partizan Beograd (4‚Äì1) and Borussia Dortmund (4‚Äì2). In the final, Inter faced off with Real Madrid who had defeated Milan (qualified as the reigning champion) in the quarter-finals. Some key men of the Spanish side, like Puskas and Di Stefano, were about to turn 40 years old but had still wishes to win. Near the end of the first half, Sandro Mazzola scored with a shot from 25 metres. During the second half, Milani scored the goal to go up by two after Vicente's mistake. Felo marked the only point for Real Madrid, before Mazzola signed the final 3‚Äì1. Inter won the trophy in its first attempt, conquering - at the same time - its first European honour. Four days later, Inter ended the domestic league equal with Bologna at 54 points.

Life  He was the son of Bernhard Hessemer, the Baurat (building commissioner) of Hesse. He spent several years at the local Gymnasium, but did not graduate, following instead his father's wishes that he join the Grand Ducal Artillery. In military school, he showed a special interest in mathematics. He later spent two years at the University of Gie√üen, studying science and philosophy. In 1817, he was a participant in the \\"Wartburg Festival\\". His cousins Adolf Ludwig, Karl and Paul Follen were among the movement's leaders. He began writing while at Gei√üen, producing mostly poems at first. When he returned to Darmstadt, he took up the study of architecture. After completing his training in 1827, he embarked on a two-year study trip to Italy. While in Rome, he learned that he had been accepted as a teacher at the St√§delschule in Frankfurt, but was allowed to extend his study trip with a visit to Egypt. He returned with hundreds of drawings of Arabic art and architecture and took up his duties in August 1830. A year later, he became a member of the Masonic Lodge. In 1838, he refused an offer from the Dresden University of Technology and remained at the St√§delschule for the rest of his life.

The house and demesne were dominant features in the rural landscape of Ireland, throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Location often reflected the distribution of better land, and this is evidenced in mid-Cork, where many of these houses were situated along the valley of the River Lee and its tributaries. The Archaeological Inventory of County Cork describes it as an abandoned two-storey country house, depicted as rectangular on the 1841 surveyed OS map, but later remodelled and enlarged by the addition of bows to side elevations and rear hipped-roof projections. An entrance front existed of three bays, with side-lights and sash windows. A roofless farm building was located to the north-west. Clonmoyle House was once a Colthurst family residence. Lewis (1837) describes the parish of Aghabologue as containing numerous large and elegant houses, to include 'Clonmoyle, the seat of C. Colthurst, Esq.' Agriculture was said to have locally improved by the exertions of Mr. Colthurst and other proprietors, who introduced a system of irrigation, drainage, and a culture of green crops. The tithe applotment book for the townland of Clonmoyle East records 'Charles Colthurst, Esq.' as occupying 36 acres. Colthurst was the son of John Colthurst and Jane Bowen. The Ordnance Survey name book c. 1840 refers to a demesne on the southern side of Clonmoyle East, containing Clonmoyle House and Cottage, interspersed with trees, some plantation and ornamental ground. It is described as a fine house with good 'offices', being the residence of Chas. Colthurst Esq., and with the River Dripsey bounding the property to the east and south. Clonmoyle House and its demesne are depicted on the 1841 surveyed OS Map, to include a fish pond, weir, waterfall and wooden bridge. By the mid-nineteenth century, the Primary Valuation of Ireland (Griffith's Valuation) records Jonathan Bruce as occupier of Clonmoyle, comprising c. 37 acres and described as a 'house, offices, gate lodge and land', with the lessor being Charles Colthurst. During the second half of the nineteenth century, the house was occupied by Henry Leader, builder of nearby Leader's Aqueduct, and whose exploits were said to include a local furze mill for the fattening of pigs. Leader possessed some 2418 acres in County Cork during the 1870s. The 1901 surveyed OS Map depicts a remodelled Clonmoyle House and surrounding demesne, to include a gate lodge, pond and boat house. The Irish Tourist Association survey of 1944 confirms Clonmoyle House as the residence of Mrs Young, who 'also owned nearby Clonmoyle Flour Mill'. The house was thought to have been erected some 150 years previously. It was described as having an excellently constructed interior, wide staircase and with the moulding of its doors and window shutters being a noticeable feature. Today, the house is in a ruinous condition and its surroundings neglected. The former fish pond and features appear infilled and the southern end is occupied by now vacant industrial premises and surrounds.

The topic covers a variety of concerns from education to equal opportunity in terms of employment and wages. Legislation In response to the concerns, the government has implemented various legislation, especially concerning gender discrimination, both institutional and personal, in the workplace; the Sex Discrimination Act of 1975 protects individuals from being discriminated against in employment, vocational training, education, the provision and sale of goods, facilities and services, premises and the exercise of public functions due to their sex/gender; this was amended by the Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002. The Equal Pay Act of 1970 mandates equal pay for equal work regardless of an individual's sex/gender, and the Sex Discrimination (Gender Reassignment) Regulations 1999 also protect the rights of individuals who intend to undergo, are undergoing, or have undergone sex reassignment. These Regulations pertain to pay and treatment in employment, self-employment and vocational training. The Equality Acts of 2006 and 2010 served to codify and combine all equality enactments within Great Britain, and provide comparable protections across all equality strands. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is a non-departmental public body which has responsibility for the promotion and enforcement of equality and non-discrimination laws in England, Scotland and Wales, while the Government Equalities Office is a government department charged with promoting and improving gender equality within the UK government itself, responsible for leading the Discrimination Law Review, and providing advice on all other forms of equality to other UK government departments. The GEO was formerly known as the Women and Equality Unit. Issues =Culture= It has increasingly been observedKnowles, in Kristina Nelson, Narcissism in High Fidelity (2004) p. 19 that a pervasive 'lad culture' has developed in the U.K., described as an ironic, self- conscious method for young males to adopt \\"an anti-intellectual position, scorning sensitivity and caring in favour of drinking, violence, and a pre- feminist and racist attitude to women as both sex objects and creatures from another species\\".Knowles, in Kristina Nelson, Narcissism in High Fidelity (2004) p. 19 In April 2014, the UN special rapporteur on violence against women similarly concluded that Britain has a \\"boys' club sexist culture\\". The culture has attracted wide criticism from feminist circles; Germaine Greer critiques it in her 2000 book The Whole Woman, while Kira Cochrane asserts that \\"it's a dark world that Loaded and the lad culture has bequeathed us\\".Kira Cochrane, \\"The dark world of lads' mags\\". Newstatesman.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-16. Commentators believe that lad culture has affected politics and decreased the ability of women to participate, and studies of industries such as the architecture profession found that lad culture had a negative impact on women completing their professional education. In April 2012, British feminist writer Laura Bates founded the Everyday Sexism Project, a website and social media presence whose aim is to document everyday examples of sexism as reported by contributors; the submissions are then collated by a small group of volunteers led by Emer O'Toole, a researcher at Royal Holloway, University of London. By April 2013 the site had collected 25,000 entries from 15 countries.Bates, Laura. \\"The Everyday Sexism Project: a year of shouting back\\", The Guardian, 16 April 2013. =Media= Various U.K. media institutions have been labelled problematic with regards to sexism and gender discrimination - most notably being the Page 3 feature found in the British tabloid newspaper The Sun, which once consisted of a large photograph of a topless female glamour model usually published on the newspaper's third page. In August 2012, the No More Page 3 campaign emerged, sparking widespread discussion and receiving heavy support from Green MP Caroline Lucas and cross- party support from over 140 other MPs. A YouGov survey in October 2012 found differences in attitude toward Page 3 among readers of different newspapers; 61% of Sun readers wished to retain the feature, while 24 percent said that the newspaper should stop showing Page 3 women. However, only 4% of Guardian readers said The Sun should keep Page 3, while 86% said it should be abolished. The poll also found wide differences by gender, with 48% of men overall saying that Page 3 should be retained, but just 17% of women taking that position. =Employment= The U.K. has a persistent gender pay gap, the most significant factors associated with which are part-time work, education, the size of the firm from which the sample is taken, and occupational segregation (women are under-represented in managerial and high-paying professional occupations.) When comparing full-time roles, men in the U.K. tend to work slightly longer hours than women in full-time employment. Depending on the age bracket and percentile of hours worked men in full-time employment work between 1.35% and 17.94% more hours than women in full-time employment.Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, 2013 Provisional Results http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference- tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-328216 Even when taking the differences in hours worked into account, a pay gap still exists in the U.K., and typically increases with age and earnings percentile.A Look At The Gender Pay Gap By Age And Earning Power http://www.octopus-hr.co.uk/hrmoz/article/the-gender-pay- gap-by-age-and-earning-power.aspx#sthash.IL6IGoYj.dpuf =Education= Inequality in the context of education has greater implications in terms of future employment. Elements of the school curriculum still advocate certain gender-specific practices. Boys lag behind girls at important educational milestones. At Key Stage 2 girls outperform boys. The proportion of students achieving level 4 and above in reading, writing and maths, in 2015, in England, was 77% boys compared to 83% girls. The gap is wider for students who receive a free school meal. House of Commons Library International Men's Day Briefing Girls outperform boys in headline GCSE results. In state-funded schools, the gap in those achieving 5+ grades a*-C including English and maths is around 10 percentage points. Young women are more likely to enrol at university. In 2016 the gender gap in favour of women was the highest on record. \\"In England, young women are 36% more likely to apply to university and when both sexes are from disadvantaged backgrounds young women are 58% more likely to apply.\\" Currently, sex education is not compulsory in the U.K., and in England and Wales, the optional curriculum focuses mainly on biological areas such as the reproductive system, foetal development, and the physical changes of adolescence, while information about contraception and safe sex is discretionaryEducation Act 1996 and discussion about relationships and gender roles is often neglected.Britain: Sex Education Under Fire UNESCO Courier;Jul/Aug2000, Vol. 53 Issue 7/8, pp. 17-18 In April 2014, Bates remarked that \\"better sex and relationships education in schools is desperately needed\\" to teach areas around \\"healthy relationships, consent, respect and sexual abuse\\" in response to tackling everyday sexism earlier in life.

Throughout the 2000s, Sadala grew into an elephant poaching kingpin in northeastern Congo, particularly in and around the Okapi Wildlife Reserve. He was arrested on at least two occasions by ICCN park rangers. In 2011, styled Morgan, he initiated the militant group \\"Mai Mai Lumumba\\" while it was commonly known as \\"Mai Mai Morgan\\". Morgan and his rebels were accused of committing the most severe crimes, such as cannibalism, rape, kidnapping and murder. Their most high-profile attacks included a siege of Epulu village, the headquarters of the Okapi Wildlife Reserve early on the morning of June 24, 2012. Morgan occupied Epulu until the afternoon of June 25, 2012 before vanishing back into the forest. In the wake of this attack, 7 people were killed, while the entire captive population of okapi in Epulu's breeding center were also shot and killed by the rebels. FARDC soldiers arrived and looted the village. Morgan enjoyed support from FARDC units in Bafwasende and Kisangani https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2015/19. In January 2013, Morgan occupied the large town of Mambasa for several hours before finally being repelled by the Congolese army. Morgan and his poaching and rebellious associates fought a bloody war, which focused mostly on occupying territory in the Ituri forest. On April 12, 2014, Morgan turned himself in to a local chief at Badengaido claiming that his followers and wives were suffering in the forest. While FARDC forces arranged for his extradition to Bunia, a gun battle erupted on April 14, 2014, the events of which are not well understood. The Congolese army were attacked with armed weapons, and as he was escaping from the gun battle, Morgan was shot in the legs and died from blood loss. The Congolese government continues to pursue loyalists to this faction, which is led by a Mbuti pygmy named Manu, and would turn themselves in after the death of Morgan.

Life Her parents were Baron Gabriel Stierncrona (1669-1723) and Antoinetta Maria Amija (1687-1721). She married Count Fredrik Gyllenborg (1698-1759), courtier and a leading member of the Hats (party), on the 27 April 1729. She had nine children during her marriage. As was still a custom in the Swedish aristocracy of the time, she kept her original name after marriage. Her education is unknown, but it is clear that she had a wide knowledge within Christianity and politics. Both her own family and that of her spouse were very wealthy. The first of her published works were the political work En swensks tankar √∂fwer den 22 Junii 1756 (The Thoughts of a Swede regarding the events of the 22 June 1756). The subjects were the recent failed attempt of Queen Louisa Ulrika to stage a coup d'√©tat to overthrow the parliament and the political system of the age of liberty and reintroduce absolute monarchy (Coup of 1756). In it she defended the current system against royal dictatorship with religious quotations. In parallel, her daughter Anna Antoinetta Gyllenborg also wrote a known political work Den k√§ra fr√§ndens sk√•l (1755). Though her published works were formally anonymously published, she was well known to be the writer. Except for her published work, she has become known for the unpublished work R√•d till mina barn (Advice to My Children), 274 pages of advice to her surviving children to how they should live their lives, written in 1760-1763. During the later years of her spouse, his political career had begun to decline, which caused severe economical difficulties as he had abused his position in politics by mixing his private economy with that of the state during adventurous business projects and taken considerable loans which he was not able to repay. When he died in 1759, Elisabeth Stierncrona retired to the estate Uttersberg and was left with great debts which the estate could not repay. She tried to save her own dowry and the inheritance of her children. She failed and she was accused of creating false accounts and she was declared bankrupt in 1766.

Shaw describes the play as a religious tract in dramatic form.Violet M. Broad & C. Lewis Broad Dictionary to the Plays and Novels of Bernard Shaw, A. & C. Black, London, 1929, p.81. In 1909 Shaw jousted with governmental censorship, as personified by The Examiner Of Plays, an agency acting under the auspices of the Lord Chamberlain. The outcome, unsatisfactory to Shaw, is reviewed minutely in the Preface to this play, which had been refused a license to perform because of statements made by the protagonist about God, which were thought to violate the blasphemy law in force at the time. Characters *Babsy *Lottie *Hannah *Jessie *Emma *Elder Daniels *Blanco Posnet *Strapper Kemp *Euphemia \\"Feemy\\" Evans *Sheriff Kemp *Foreman of jury *Nestor *Waggoner Joe *The Woman  Plot summary The play is set in the American West. Blanco Posnet, a local drunk and reprobate, is brought before the court accused of stealing a horse belonging to the Sheriff. He had been found walking along a road out of town after having left his brother's house in the early hours of the morning. The same night the horse had gone missing from his brother's stable. His accusers assume he has sold or concealed the horse. Blanco says they can't convict him without evidence that he ever had the horse. He also says he was owed some jewellery belonging to his mother, which had been bequeathed to him, but his brother had refused to hand it over. Even if he did take the horse he did so as payment for the debt his brother owed. Unfortunately he was unaware that the horse was merely being stabled by his brother, but belonged to the Sheriff. His brother, a reformed drunkard who is now a church Deacon, lectures Blanco on morality and judgement, but Blanco ridicules his brother's view of God. Feemy, the local prostitute, is called to witness. She says that she saw Blanco riding off on the horse. Blanco says that her word cannot be trusted, as she is a woman of low character and she admits was drunk at the time; in any case she has a grudge against him because - unlike members of the jury he can name - he had no interest in her services. The jury are outraged and strongly inclined to convict Blanco. At this point news arrives that the horse has been found. A woman had used it to take her sick child to the nearest doctor. The woman is brought to the court. She says she was given the horse by a man who was about to pass her on it on the road as she was carrying her dying child. She had pleaded with the man to allow her to take the horse. The judge asks her to name the man, but she absolutely denies that Blanco was the man who gave her the horse. She says that the man who did give it to her evidently did so in the knowledge that on foot he would probably be caught and could be hanged. It is clear to everyone that Blanco gave her the horse, but she cannot bring herself to name him if it will mean his conviction and inevitable hanging. Feemy takes the stand again and says she was lying about having seen Blanco. She never saw him on the horse. Blanco is released. He offers to marry Feemy in thanks for what she did, but she rejects him. Blanco says he'll buy drinks for everyone in the saloon and offers to shake Feemy's hand. She accepts. Production and censorship The play was originally to have been performed in one of Herbert Beerbohm Tree's After Noon Theatre productions at His Majesty's Theatre. However, the censor demanded changes to the text because the statements made by Blanco Posnet about God were thought to contravene the Blasphemy law. Shaw refused to alter the text, insisting that the views expressed were absolutely central to meaning of the play. The Theatres Act 1843 only applied to the vicinities of London, Oxbridge, and royal residences, and not at all in Ireland. Shaw suggested that the play could be performed at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin. The play was accepted. Despite pressure from the Dublin Castle administration to stop the production, it went ahead. Shaw refused to make any of the changes requested by the censor, but did make two changes in the play at the suggestion of Lady Gregory, as he believed they were improvements, but they had nothing to do with the issues raised by the censorship. The Abbey players' first public performance was in Liverpool on 10 April 1909. Its Dublin premiere on 25 August 1909 played to \\"a packed house\\", including James Joyce, who was reviewing it for the Trieste newspaper Piccolo della sera (and was \\"mightily unimpressed\\" by it).Robert Welch, The Abbey Theatre, 1899-1999: Form and Pressure, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1999, p.51. W. B. Yeats had been keen to put on the play to emphasise that culture in Ireland could be more liberal-minded than England. Before the first performance he gave a speech saying, The Abbey production transferred to London for two private performances (which were legal) at the Aldwych Theatre on 5 and 6 December 1909 under the auspices of the Incorporated Stage Society. The play was later performed to the general public at the recently founded, amateur, People's Theatre, Newcastle upon Tyne (than called the Clarion Dramatic Society), in September 1911, and again in April 1912, when it formed part of a double-bill with Shaw's How He Lied to Her Husband. This play marked the beginning of a long association between Shaw and the People's Theatre, where several more productions of it took place between March 1913 and June 1930, with a final revival in January 1951. Meaning Shaw claimed that \\"this little play is really a religious tract in dramatic form\\", the plot being less important than the debate about morality and divinity that occurs between the characters. He was using the folksy language and quirky insights of his principal character to explore his version of the Nietzschean concept that modern morality must move \\"beyond good and evil\\". Shaw took the view that God is a process of continual self-overcoming: \\"if I could conceive a god as deliberately creating something less than himself, I should class him as a cad. If he were simply satisfied with himself, I should class him as a lazy coxcomb. My god must continually strive to surpass himself.\\" When he heard that Leo Tolstoy had shown an interest in the ideas expressed in the play, he wrote a letter to him explaining his views further: Shaw's friend and biographer Archibald Henderson summarises the meaning of the play as follows: Henderson, who was American, found Shaw's attempts to depict the West unconvincing to the point of absurdity, \\"To an American, familiar with the scenes and conditions described, the superficial pseudo-realism of the play is grotesque in its unreality\\", but the central idea was effective ‚Äî the attempt to represent an original idea of God forming in the mind of a \\"crude\\" person at the edge of civilisation: \\"It is a study of the sudden impact of the idea of a primitive God upon the mind of a crude cowboy\\". James Joyce in his review for Il Piccolo della sera said he agreed with Shaw's own subtitle, the play was \\"a sermon in crude melodrama...the art is too poor to make it convincing as drama\\". He thought Shaw was showing himself up as bombastic sermoniser. Shaw had a gloriously \\"profane and unruly past. Fabianism, vegetarianism, prohibitionism, music, painting, drama--all the progressive movements in art and politics--have had him as champion. And now, perhaps some divine finger has touched his brain, and he, in the guise of Blanco Posnet, is shewn up\\".James Joyce, \\" Bernard Shaw's Battle with the Censor (1909)\\" as quoted in Martha Fodaski Black, Shaw and Joyce: The Last Word in Stolentelling, University Press of Florida, Gainesville, FL., 1995, p.322 References 1909 plays Plays by George Bernard Shaw Plays about British prostitution Plays set in the United States Censorship in the arts ","title":"The Shewing-Up of Blanco Posnet"},{"id":"42510956","text":"Kerans v.

State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 463 U.S. 29 (1983), is a United States Supreme Court decision concerning regulations requiring passive restraints in cars. In it, the Court struck down an order by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration rescinding regulations that required either airbags or automatic seat belts in new cars.. It held that the same arbitrary and capricious standard for reviewing agency actions applied to rescind regulations as that to enact regulations. It also held that the rescission of the rule requiring some sort of passive restraint was arbitrary and capricious because it failed to consider the alternative of requiring all cars to have airbags. Finally, it held that the agency had too quickly dismissed the safety benefits of automatic seat belts. The case is noteworthy not only for its effects on car safety but also in clarifying the Court's approach to reviewing agency actions under the Administrative Procedure Act.  Background  The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 directs the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to issue safety standards that \\"shall be practicable, shall meet the need for motor vehicle safety, and shall be stated in objective terms.\\". The resulting regulations went through a tumultuous history, with over 60 rulemaking notices having been amended, rescinded, reimposed, and then re-rescinded. The original rulemaking simply mandated seat belts. However, that soon proved to be ineffective, as more than half of people never wore their seat belt during that time period.463 U.S. at 54, n.19. The NHTSA proposed using passive restraint systems, devices that would protect drivers even if drivers took no action other than that necessary to drive the car. The two main proposed mechanisms were automatic seat belts and airbags. In 1969, the NHTSA proposed a standard requiring installation of some kind of passive restraint for drivers,34 Fed. Reg. 11,148-01 which was later amended to include all front seat passengers.37 Fed. Reg. 3911 The regulations adopted required passive restraints for vehicles built after 1975 and allowed those built between 1973 and 1975 to use a system in which the car would start only if the seatbelt was in use. This \\"ignition interlock\\" option proved unpopular and resulted in Congress passing the Motor Vehicle and Schoolbus Safety Amendments of 1974, which disallowed ignition interlocks and required restraint systems other than seat belts to be approved by congressional resolution before going into effect.. In 1976, the optional alternatives were extended indefinitely by Secretary of Transportation William Coleman, and the passive restraint requirement suspended because of expected public resistance. They were then reinstated by Coleman's successor, Brock Adams, and then they were re-rescinded by his successor, Andrew Lewis. The last rescission is the action that the Supreme Court reviewed.463 U.S. at 34-38. The NHTSA justified the rescission by saying that there was no longer sufficient evidence for the efficacy of the regulations. That was because of not a change in judgment about the technology but a change in car manufacturers' plans. Whereas the NHTSA originally estimated that 40% of new cars would have automatic seat belts, it turned out that 99% of cars would use them. In addition, they were going to use a detachable type of automatic seat belt, which could easily be detached, when they would operate like normal seat belts. The NHTSA also worried that the change would be expensive and sour the public's view towards safety regulations, as it would be seen as a wasteful, imposing example of bureaucratic overreach.463 U.S. at 38-39. Though the DC Circuit found that rescinding a rule has \\"parallels\\" to failing to act and agency's failure to act was subject to only \\"very narrow\\" review, thus suggesting a narrow review in the case of rescission, it still vacated the rescission partially because of congressional action in response to NHTSA regulations, which it saw as heightening the standard of review. It gave the following reasons for vacating the rescission: there was insufficient evidence to sustain the conclusion that it could not predict an increase in seat belt usage and \\"only a well-justified refusal to seek more evidence could render rescission non-arbitrary,\\"680 F.2d at 232. the NHTSA had inadequately considered the possibility of requiring nondetachable automatic seat belts, and it had inadequately considered the possibility of requiring airbags.  Decision  Justice White, writing for the majority, disagreed with the DC Circuit and held that the scope of judicial review is the same for rescission as it is for enacting regulations in the first place. The Supreme Court explicitly rejected the view that it should treat rescission the same as a refusal to regulate in the first place: \\"The Motor Vehicle Safety Act expressly equates orders 'revoking' and 'establishing' safety standards; neither that Act nor the APA suggests that revocations are to be treated as refusals to promulgate standards.\\"463 U.S. at 41. It also rejected the view that the congressional action, after the enactment of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, had affected the standard of review even if it could inform the Court's interpretation of the statute.463 U.S. at 45. However, the Court agreed with the DC Circuit that the rescission was arbitrary and capricious for failing to consider the possibility of requiring airbags. Although agencies need not consider every possible alternative, requiring air bags was an obvious option since that was part of the original regulations. The fact that the car companies, which \\"waged the regulatory equivalent of war\\" against airbags, would try to evade the regulations was not a reason to repeal them.463 U.S. at 49.

Created by editor-plotter Stan Lee, writer Ernest Hart, and artist Dick Ayers, the character first appeared in Strange Tales #111 (August 1963). Publication history The character made his official debut in Strange Tales #111 (August 1963). The plot was developed by editor Stan Lee and the story was written by Ernest Hart, under the pen name H. Huntley, with illustrations by Dick Ayers. Asbestos Man did not reappear in the comics for many years until 2011's Fear Itself storyline. Fictional character biography Dr. Orson Karloff is \\"the world's foremost analytical chemist\\". He invents a chemical capable of melting metals, among other things, which he thinks he can use to steal money from banks like Fort Knox. However, he is not swift or stealthy and is almost caught by the police during one of his burgling attempts. Realizing that he is not skillful enough, Karloff adopts the supervillain handle of Asbestos Man and retreats to an obscure castle, where he hones his powers and one day challenges Human Torch to a showdown. The Torch nonchalantly agrees. However, it is Asbestos Man who ultimately wins, having created a flame-resistant armor out of \\"super- asbestos\\" (a combination of iron, calcium and chrysotile), rendering Storm's powers useless. Asbestos Man decides to spare the Torch, having already made a mockery of him. Asbestos Man's triumph over the Torch becomes big news. Ralph Baker, otherwise known as the \\"King of the Underworld\\", becomes aware of the villain and ropes him in to help carry out a bank heist. A humiliated Human Torch returns to settle scores with Asbestos Man, after being encouraged by his fellow Fantastic Four members. At the bank, the Human Torch absorbs all oxygen present. Asbestos Man is forced to surrender and he is promptly hauled to prison. During the Fear Itself storyline, Asbestos Man is revealed to have developed cancer due to the toxicity of his super-asbestos suit and is now living in an oxygen tank. He makes clear his desire to return to life as a villain, but is persuaded not to by the Great Lakes Avengers. Years later, the Human Torch mentioned that Asbestos Man had died.Fantastic Four Vol. 5 #1 Powers and abilities Asbestos Man possesses a superhuman ability to analyze chemistry. His superhuman analytic chemistry enabled him to develop a super solvent and \\"super-asbestos\\". His \\"super-asbestos\\" armor is high in toxicity and is also resistant to heat. Additionally, his iron shield can block out flames and his metal net is capable of energy manipulation. He holds a Ph.D in analytical chemistry. Cultural significance At the time of Asbestos Man's creation, many were ignorant about the dangers of asbestos. The California Asbestos Legal Center paid tribute to Asbestos Man in May 2012, writing in its entry on the Mesothelioma Lawyer Blog that he, alongside a similar villainess Asbestos Lady, was \\"a lasting reminder of the significant cover-up perpetrated by the asbestos industry regarding the danger associated with asbestos exposure\\". Filip Mundt of the Karolinska Institute also cited Asbestos Man and Asbestos Lady as examples of asbestos being considered a \\"miracle fibre\\" at times in the 20th century.

The character was created by plotter Stan Lee, writer Robert Bernstein and artist Jack Kirby. He first appeared in Strange Tales #108 (1963). Publication history The Painter's premiere in Strange Tales #108 (May 1963) was a collaboration between editor and story-plotter Stan Lee, script-writer Robert Bernstein, and story-artist Jack Kirby, with inking done by Dick Ayers and Terry Szenics in charge of lettering. The story is republished in Human Torch #8 (November 1975). The character is re-imagined by Pierce Askegren in his 1996 work The Ultimate Super-Villains, edited by Lee and published by Byron Preiss. Fictional character biography =Origins= Manhattan-based Wilhelm van Vile, an aspiring painter, attempts to pass off counterfeit paintings as the real deal. However, he makes many obvious mistakes when producing these fake works (such as coloring the boy in The Blue Boy green). Van Vile is promptly sent to jail. =1960s= After being released, van Vile embarks on a cash- counterfeiting career but he once again does not heed major details. Johnny Storm easily spots his mistakes and throws him back into prison. Tunneling through a crevice in his prison cell's flooring, he finds an underground sanctuary, in which are mystical paints left behind by extraterrestrials. Van Vile discovers that whatever he creates with these paints will come to life. Forming an alliance with a number of small-time criminals, including Scar Tobin, van Vile adopts the nom de guerre of The Painter of 1000 Perils, or The Painter in short. He then exploits his new-found powers to exact revenge against Johnny Storm. Storm initially struggles to match the Painter's attacks. However, he later outsmarts the Painter by producing a double of himself, which the villain assumes is the real one. The real Storm takes the opportunity to destroy the Painter's magical paints. =Return and death= The Painter regains his supervillain abilities some time later and comes under the influence of a multitude of insects which inhabit his body. Using unspecified means, he takes over the wills of Bora and Spark and sends them to antagonise Spider-Man and Johnny Storm respectively. Collaboratively, he, Spark and Bora comprise \\"Avant Guard\\", a supervillain team. When they lose and the situation goes stale, the Painter turns the two mutants into portraits and apparently kills himself by means of bodily explosion. =Resurrection= Somehow the Painter is revived (or it could be presumed that it was a double who died previously), and he is seen imprisoned in a supervillain detainment facility, among numerous other foes who go against Spider-Man after being freed from their cells. Dressing up as Morlun, the Painter is swiftly defeated without much challenge. Powers and abilities Strictly speaking, the Painter does not possess any superpowers, although he is a considerably skilled artist; he has cited himself as the \\"greatest painter on Earth\\". It is his enchanted paints that allow him to paint inanimate matter to life. These creations can be erased from existence if he desires so. On top of that, the paints grant him superhuman speed when painting. Other versions =The Ultimate Super-Villains = Having spent many years behind bars, the Pierce Askegren version of the Painter decides to turn over a new leaf and finds a job as a professional illustrator. He is confronted by an aged Scar Tobin, who demands that the Painter surrender his sorcerous paints. The Painter does not relent and fights back with many of his doubles. It is later revealed that the Painter has not forsaken his criminal life, but instead has been keeping a low profile.

The short, informal service typically includes communion or prayer, singing, and age-appropriate Biblical stories, followed by a snack and hot beverages, play time, and informal conversation. The service may be led by the vicar, or, more often, by a layperson, or Mothers Union volunteer. The mothers may lead the service themselves. Women in the priesthood may have gotten their first experience leading religious services with such forms of worship. History Pram services have been conducted in Anglican and Methodist churches for at least thirty years, since the 1980s. Today, non-denominational Christian churches may also hold pram services. In 2014, it was called a \\"Messy Church and Pram Service\\". It is sometimes referred to as a 'toddler service'. Setting The chapter house of St Robert's Church, Pannal, at which a pram service is conducted. A pram service is often held on a weekday morning, but may be held mid-afternoon (2:00 or 2:15 p.m.), with sufficient time for the children's guardians to pick up older children after the end of the school day. While it can be held in the church, the informal service can also be conducted in the chapter house the chancel, church house, or community center. A popular \\"how-to\\" guide to children's programming advises that when running a monthly pram service, make it as simple and in familiar circumstances as possible, to draw in parents who might \\"not feel at ease in a church.\\" The purposes of the service are to provide an opportunity for adults to meet others, as well as catechism and new friends for the children. Some parents just use the chance to get away from housekeeping for an hour. The cost is usually free; however, the church may ask for a small donation. The service can be used for evangelism of younger people.

It was the focus of ongoing harassment from the ABC Department because homosexual activity, including serving alcohol to gay people, was illegal and would result in arrest. Introduction Richmond, Virginia in recent years has been known to be a youthful and open-minded city. However, things were not always as free for some of the city's citizens. From the 1940s till the late 1970s Richmond had an underground culture that thrived beneath vigilant eyes. The gay community had to build its own society in order to catch up on news, socialize, and hook up. The Block was known as a particular area in downtown Richmond where the gay community thrived at night. The establishments in this area had to deal with constant harassment from the ABC Department because serving and participating in any sort of gay activity would result in arrest. Geography In the 1940s the Block started off being bounded by First, Franklin, Main, and Foushee streets. As the community grew, the Block expanded to Grace Street.Beth Marschak and Alex Lorch, Lesbian and Gay Richmond (Arcadia Publishing), 57. The community had to move frequently to avoid pressure from local authorities. This area was also known for its hustlers and prostitution, but the police were more concerned with finding people participating in homosexual acts.Marschak and Lorch, Richmond, 57. Alcohol and Beverage Control issues In the late 1960s a couple of well-known bars, Renee's and Rathskeller, were shut down by the ABC department for serving any homosexuals. The regulations used to persecute the gays are as follows: \\\\- Section 4-37 states in part \\"‚Ä¶ a bar's license may be suspended or revoked if the bar has become a meeting place and rendezvous for users of narcotics, drunks, homosexuals, prostitutes, pimps, panderers, gamblers or habitual law violators‚Ä¶\\" \\\\- Section 4 ‚Äì 98 \\"‚Ä¶forbids a licensee from employing any person who has the general reputation as a prostitute, homosexual, panderer, gambler, habitual law violator, person of ill repute, user of or peddler of narcotics, or person who drinks to excess or a \\"B-girl.\\" \\"Developing Identity: A Prelude to Activism.\\" When ABC closed down Renee's the ABC board heard a testimony from one of their agents that they witnessed \\"men wearing makeup, embracing and kissing in the caf√©.\\" Marschak and Lorch, Richmond, 33. Such a statement resulted in the bar having their beer and wine license revoked on March 13, 1969. These regulations were maintained until 1993 when the anti-gay provisions were removed when the Virginia General Assembly revised the state ABC code. Cruising around the Block Broad Street Station and the USO were one of the first and biggest settings for gay cruising in the 1940s and 1950s. Broad Street Station was located on West Broad and the USO on the northeast corner of Eighth and East Broad Street.Marschak and Lorch, Richmond, 25. Both of these locations were teeming with service men on leave or heading to another assignment. Bob Swisher, a notable gay writer in Richmond, wrote an article for Our Community Press talking to a serviceman under a pseudonym. His article explains the type of things that went on at these stations from a first hand experience: \\"Mark Kerkorian (a pseudonym) recalled the military personnel were \\"ready for anything\\" if they hadn't picked up a girl by 11 or 12 at night and that there were lots of places to take them like the basement of the hotel across Broad Street from the USO, or the men's room in the hotel or an alley behind the Colonial Theater.\\" The activity at these establishments laid the foundation for what was later known as the \\"Block.\\" Bars on the Block =Marroni's= Marroni's Restaurant was opened in 1947 by E. Louis Marroni in the Capitol Hotel. The Capitol Hotel was located at 206 North Eighth Street. Marroni's was one of the most popular gay bars in the city until it had to close in 1962.Marschak and Lorch, Richmond, 26. =Eton's= Eton's was located at 938 West Grace Street. William A. Rotella opened Eton's in 1962 following Marroni's closing. It was one block away from Richmond Professional Institute, which became VCU in 1968.Marschak and Lorch, Richmond, 32. Eton's became the new hot spot for the underground gay society after Marroni's. VCU had actually banned its students from attending and held a strong stance against homosexuality.Markle (2013) From Stonewall to Richmond. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5o5iXrscaA The school officials alerted the ABC board about a gay bar being so close to campus. After investigation the board charged Rotella with eight different charges. The charges varied from serving beer to gays and minors to being a meeting place for homosexuals. On March 31, 1967, the ABC board revoked Eton's liquor license and it closed. Until 2016, the VCU police department was housed where Eton's used to be. =Renee's= Renee's was another popular gay bar that took the place of Marroni's in the Capitol Hotel. Robert Gene Baldwin opened his restaurant in 1963. Like all the gay bars in the area, the ABC was constantly trying to shut it down. After ABC agents reported seeing \\"men wearing makeup, embracing and kissing in the caf√©\\" Baldwin had his liquor license taken away and was forced to close for serving gays in March 1969. =Rathskeller's= Rathskeller's was one of the gay bars situated outside the usual Block. Robert Gene Baldwin also owned this establishment, which was located at 3526 West Cary Street, and it faced a similar demise at the hands of the ABC board. Following Renee's shutdown, Rathskeller's was also closed the same month for serving gays. The shutdown of both bars resulted in the first open protest against anti-gay action in Richmond.Marschak and Lorch, Richmond, 34. Leo Joseph Koury Leo Joseph Koury (July 14, 1934 - June 17, 1991) was a notorious figure in the Block community due to his monopoly on exploiting the gay community. He realized that he could drastically over charge the gay patrons to be in a place they could socialize comfortably, considering that in a straight bars they could legally be denied service because of their sexuality, or presumed sexuality. However, Koury's monopoly ended in October 1978 when a grand jury charged him with murder, racketeering, and other offenses that occurred at several gay bars.Marschak and Lorch, Richmond, 50. Before he was properly arrested Koury left Richmond to go on the run from the police. In 1979 the FBI added him to their Ten Most Wanted List and he was profiled again in 1991 by America's Most Wanted. Koury was never properly arrested because police learned that he had died while on the run to California. =The Dialtone= Koury opened a new gay bar in the same location called the Dialtone in 1975. Dialtone was unique for a gay bar at the time because each table had phones for patrons to introduce themselves to each other from different tables.\\"Gay Dating in the 50s and 60s ‚Äì 'The Block,' Nicki's, and Organized Crime\\" Koury sold the bar in 1976 to James Locklan Hilliard Jr, who renamed the restaurant J.Danhill Restaurant in September of that year. =Smitty's= Smitty's was another fan bar that extended the Block. From 1954 until 1959 Smitty's was located on 310 South Sheppard Street and was the primary hangout for women's softball teams.Marschak and Lorch, Richmond, 49. Koury added Smitty's to the list of gay bars he ran in the early 1960s. He referred to himself as the \\"godfather of the gay community.\\" He changed the name to Leo's and continued to welcome to crowd regulars from Smitty's. By the 1970s his bar had turned into more of a gay men's bar and eatery. In 1976, Koury had relinquished the bar into the hands of a relative who renamed it the Male Box. =The Male Box= The Male Box made headlines when in 1977 a co-conspirator of Koury fired a shotgun into a crowd killing Albert Thomas and injuring two others. The shooting was seen as a way to regain control of his business. The incident sparked fear into the gay community because many assumed it was a violent homophobic hate crime. Present day Life in Richmond, Virginia is substantially different from how it was before the 1980s. As more activism and support grew for the gay community, more establishments to serve them popped up. The gay community is no longer suppressed and limited to a one-block radius. Any adult of any orientation can go to a bar and order a beverage without being exploited, turned away, or arrested. Beth Marschak, Guy Kinman, and Bob Jones, who are major LGBT activists in Richmond, were interviewed by a local gay news source to talk about how much things have changed. Marschak and Jones commented on how there are only four outright gay bars currently, but that this was progress because strictly gay-only bars are not necessary for the community to socialize anymore. Jones was quoted by saying, \\"all these young people, lots of single women. I didn't notice any gay people. But now you just wouldn't know.\\" References * \\"Developing Identity: A Prelude to Activism.\\" Out History. http://www.outhistory.org/exhibits/show/rainbow- richmond/developing-identity * From Stonewall to Richmond.

History The United States Numbered Highway System (U.S. Highway System) was originally approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) with assistance by the United States Department of Agriculture Joint Board on Interstate Highways on November 11, 1926. The Arizona State Highway Department (ASHD) formally recognized the U.S. Highways on September 9, 1927, during the establishment of the Arizona State Highway System. When the U.S. Highways within Arizona were first being planned, the proposed routes consisted of U.S. Route 60 (US 60) from Topock to Lupton, US 70 from Holbrook to New Mexico, US 80 from Yuma to New Mexico, US 89 from Flagstaff to Utah, US 91 from Nevada to Utah through the Arizona Strip, US 180 from Florence Junction to New Mexico, US 280 from Ash Fork to Phoenix and US 380 from Tucson to Nogales. When the system was commissioned however, noticeable changes had been made. US 60 had been renumbered to US 66 and US 280 and US 380 became a southern extension of US 89\\\\. This also meant US 89 shared a long concurrency with US 80 between Phoenix and Tucson, as well as a wrong-way concurrency with US 66 between Flagstaff and Ash Fork. In 1931, US 70 became the first U.S. Highway to be decommissioned in Arizona. It was replaced by US 60 between Springerville and New Mexico, and by a newly commissioned highway designated US 260 between Holbrook and Springerville. US 60 had also been established over other existing state highways from Ehrenberg to Springerville, creating a concurrency with US 80 and US 89 between Phoenix and Florence Junction. US 70 was given a new routing between Clovis and El Paso, Texas via Alamogordo, New Mexico. US 180 was re-designated as part of a new extension of US 70 through Arizona in 1935. US 70 also ran entirely concurrent with US 60 from Ehrenberg to Globe. 1935 was also the year US 466 and US 93 were extended southeast from Nevada to Kingman, by way of the recently completed Boulder Dam (now Hoover Dam). Both US 93 and US 466 were entirely concurrent with each other in Arizona. By 1939, US 666 had been extended south into Arizona, at a terminus with US 80 in Douglas. US 666 was concurrent with US 66 between Lupton and Sanders, US 260 from St. Johns to Alpine and US 70 between San Jose and Safford. By this time, US 260 had also been extended southeast to New Mexico. In 1941, an alternate route of US 89 known as US 89A had been established over former State Route 79 (SR 79) between Prescott and Flagstaff, via Jerome and Sedona. Following the end of the Second World War, traffic had greatly increased on the U.S. Highway System throughout the country, resulting in an increase of traffic accidents and rough road conditions. These factors would contribute to the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, which established the Interstate and Defense Highway System (which are often referred to as \\"Interstates\\" for short) was established. This new network of nationwide freeways was slated to replace the heaviest traveled U.S. Highways and state highways in the country. Five Interstates were planned in Arizona to supplant or bypass existing U.S. Highways. US 60 between Ehrenberg and Phoenix was to be replaced by the western section of the newly planned Interstate 10 (I-10), I-8 and the eastern section of I-10 were to bypass or replace the entirety of US 80, I-40 was to replace the entirety of US 66, I-17 and I-19 were to replace parts of US 89 and I-15 was to replace all of US 91\\\\. Construction of the Interstate Highway system was well underway by 1957. Despite the introduction of the Interstates, attention was still paid to designating new U.S. Highways or altering the routes of existing examples. In 1959, US 89 between Utah and Bitter Springs was moved onto a new route through Page over the Glen Canyon Dam. The older route between Utah and Bitter Springs became a northern extension of US 89A. In 1960, the southern section of SR 95 between Quartzsite and San Luis was re-designated as an extension of US 95\\\\. The remainder of US 95 in Arizona was concurrent with US 60 (future I-10) between Ehrenberg and Quartzsite. By 1963, US 260 had been decommissioned and made into a western extension of US 180\\\\. US 180 was also extended over US 66 from Holbrook to Flagstaff and replaced SR 164 between Flagstaff and Valle. In 1965, sections of SR 64 and SR 364 between US 89 and Four Corners were designated as part of the new US 164\\\\. US 164 was also concurrent with US 89 between former SR 64 and US 66 in Flagstaff.

The role was originated by actress Cynthia Watros, who debuted in the role on November 15, 2013. In 2014, following her booking a pilot on MTV, the role was immediately recast with Daytime Emmy Award winner Cady McClain, who debuted in the role on April 16, 2014. On May 29, 2015, McClain made her final appearance as Kelly. Originally introduced as a grief support group member in a group attended by Billy Abbott (Billy Miller, David Tom, Burgess Jenkins) and Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle), she soon becomes involved in an affair with Billy, and reveals a mysterious connection with Dr. Ben \\"Stitch\\" Rayburn (Sean Carrigan), later revealed to be her brother.  Casting and creation  Watros credited her casting in the role to executive producer Jill Farren Phelps, with whom she previously worked on Guiding Light. In September 2013, Entertainment Weekly broke news that former Guiding Light and Lost actress Cynthia Watros had joined the cast of The Young and the Restless in the recurring role of \\"Kelly\\". Watros' arrival was said to have \\"profound influence\\" on several of the characters connected to the canvas. Soap Opera Digest confirmed Watros' debut for sometime in November 2013. Entertainment Weekly further confirmed that Kelly was a former school teacher whose son was killed in a hit-and-run car accident, and that she'd interact with Billy Abbott (Billy Miller), whose character recently lost his own child on-screen, and that they would meet in a support group for grieving parents. They further confirmed her first airdate as November 15, 2013. Watros attributed her casting in the role to executive producer Jill Farren Phelps, with whom she previously worked with during her time on Guiding Light. She complimented, \\"She‚Äôs a perfect combination of someone who knows what she‚Äôs doing, and she‚Äôs a strong woman.\\" Upon accepting the role, Watros knew there was a potential for her to vacate, due to her also being involved in a potential pilot series for MTV. In January 2014, The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that Watros' pilot Finding Carter had been ordered into a full series by MTV. Immediately following, it was reported a casting call for the role of \\"Molly\\" was put out by The Young and the Restless, which a character description that closely described the character of Kelly, causing alarm that Watros may vacate the role. In February 2014, it was confirmed that Watros would depart the series in order to pursue the pilot full-time. In her place, CBS hired former All My Children and As the World Turns actress Cady McClain into the role of Kelly. TV Guide further confirmed that the immediate recasting of the role would likely be due to the potential, romantic pairing with Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman). TV Guide further reported that Watros will last tape on March 14, and will last air on April 16, 2014. McClain began shooting on March 26, and made her on-screen debut on April 24, 2014. In an interview with On Air, On Soaps with Michael Fairman, McClain spoke on the process of gaining the role of Kelly. She revealed, \\"I got an email from Y&R; casting director, Judy Blye Wilson asking me to send a reel of my work over for the possibility that they may need to recast Cynthia Watros, because it looked like her pilot was going to get picked up. Luckily, Jon Lindstrom had just helped me make a beautiful reel of some of my soap and film work. We sent that over, and then it was quiet for awhile. I know they were looking at a lot of actresses, who of course, wanted to be on Y&R;, but I stayed in the running. Then, I sent in another reel of my work from All My Children last year, and I was still in the running (laughs), and then I got the phone call and an offer, and that was pretty much it!\\" During her first day of work (March 20), McClain worked alongside Bergman, David Tom and Kristoff St. John. McClain further clarified her first airdate to be April 16, 2014, six days earlier than originally reported. In an interview with Michael Logan of TV Guide magazine, McClain spoke on the pressures of replacing Watros, stating, \\"There's much more pressure being an instant replacement. Boom! Usually when this happens on a soap there's a break of a few months or at least weeks. And Cynthia was mind-bogglingly good and really made her mark with some award- worthy work. So I'm like, 'Oh, s‚Äît!' But I'm bringing my A game and hoping the fans will accept me.\\" Following continued speculation, McClain confirmed her exit in the June 15, 2015 issue of Soap Opera Digest. She made her final appearance on May 29, 2015.  Character development  Prior to Kelly's arrival, it was unveiled that she is a recently divorced mother, who also lost her son in a tragic accident. She soon strikes up a close friendship with Billy Abbott (Billy Miller). Her past is later developed when she runs into an old friend, Dr. Ben \\"Stitch\\" Rayburn, which whom she continues to taunt a secret from his own past. With the casting of McClain in the role, she was asked if she'd channel some of the \\"bitch\\" from her portrayal of Rosanna during her first-run on As the World Turns. McClain commented, \\"It‚Äôs so much fun to be a ‚Äúbitch‚Äù! At first, it was hard to be so mean. But then I was like, ‚ÄúThis is so great.‚Äù (Laughs) I have this whole new idea of the character of Kelly in my head. I have this feeling Kelly has this edge to her, but it‚Äôs not an edge like a bitch. It‚Äôs kind of like raw ambition.\\" McClain also commented on Kelly having \\"self hate\\" and being a \\"complex character\\", as she tries to put the pieces of the character together for herself.  Storylines  Kelly first appears in Genoa City at a grief support group, telling the story about how her son, Sam, died after being struck by a car, leading it to the end of her marriage to her husband, Dean. She meets Billy (Billy Miller) and Victoria Abbott (Amelia Heinle), who are grieving over the loss of Billy's daughter, Delia Abbott (Sophie Pollono). Billy and Kelly continue to meet and discuss their grief outside of the group, as Billy finds Victoria hard to talk to. Victoria is shown to be jealous of their relationship as she can't give Billy the support he needs. Billy and Kelly later have an affair leaving them guilt- ridden. Kelly is also revealed to know Dr. Ben \\"Stitch\\" Rayburn (Sean Carrigan) and that he is hiding something about who he really is. She is befriended by Lily Winters (Christel Khalil) while working on a fundraising event for a foundation in Delia's name. At the event, she mistakes Billy's brother Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) for her blind date Lily set her up with; Kelly and the attendees are later held in a hostage situation, which leads to the revelation of Kelly's affair to Billy (David Tom). Kelly is then shunned by a majority of Genoa City after the fundraising event for her involvement with Billy. She meets Jack again, where he offers her money to go somewhere far away from Billy, in which she is deeply insulted and rejects his offer. After resigning from GC Cares, Lily hires her at Jabot Cosmetics. Jack then attempts to rectify his mistake, and takes Kelly out on a dinner date, much to the displeasure of Jack's family members, in particularly Billy. As their relationship begins to blossom, Jack and Kelly agree to break things off because of Jack's love for Phyllis Summers, and Phyllis' daughter, Summer Newman (Hunter King); Summer, however, agrees to ease up, which allows the pair to be together. Kelly's connection with Stitch begins to play a part in her relationship with Jack, and when confronted about their closeness, Kelly reveals that she is Stitch's sister, and that she was the cause for his marriage ending to Jenna Kieran (Stephanie Lemelin). In September 2014, Kelly and Stitch's mother, Maureen (Meredith Baxter) arrives in Genoa City, much to their surprise.  Reception  \\"In these first scenes, it reminded us of just how great an actress Watros is,\\" Michael Fairman of On Air, On Soaps exclaimed of Cynthia Watros' first episode with the series. For her portrayal of Kelly, Watros received a pre-nomination for the 41st Daytime Emmy Awards in the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. Concerning news of Cady McClain's casting in the role, Michael Fairman remarked, \\"Enter the talented and ever popular, McClain!\\" Recounting her time with Watros, co-star Amelia Heinle, who portrays Victoria Newman, remarked: \\"I love Cynthia Watros! She has been doing such a great job. I did not realize how great she is, but she is really good. She is my kind of actress, and she would have been a great cast member to add to the show.\\" She also spoke about the incoming of McClain in the role, stating, \\"[...] but I know Cady McClain. She‚Äôs a great actress too, and a sweetheart! I think we worked briefly together on All My Children.\\" In the March 31, 2014 issue of Soap Opera Digest, columnist Mara Levinsky applauded and thanked The Young and the Restless for hiring McClain into the role. She remarked, \\"With only four shows left, casting directors and execs should be turning their eyes to performers like them.\\" She further called the departure of Watros as a \\"blow\\" to the series, but that it was \\"softened\\" with McClain's arrival into the role.

The acting seldom rises above the level of that found in religious instructional shorts for very small children.

While no records indicate this surname purchasing land in Manatee County, in the earliest years of settlement some homesteaders never established legal claim over their land, and therefore a record may not exist.

The botanical garden in Bradenton, Florida is known as the Palma Sola Botanical Garden. History Palma Sola (originally known as The Village Of Palma Sola) was first settled in 1868 by James Warner, a Springfield, Massachusetts nationally known gunsmith. The site of the town was most likely chosen due to the fact it was close to the mouth of the Manatee River which is a very deep river. He built his house on the Manatee River in which would now be Palma Sola. He died about one year later and left the rest of his family there and one of his sons Warburton S. Warner. Palma Sola was laid out in 1884. The town was called Palma Sola because of a lone palm tree that guided boats to the town from the Manatee River. Early settlers were J.A Felts, J.B. Rogers, A.T. Williams, John Flowers and Asa Pillsbury. The town was even the largest town in Manatee County until the turn of the century. ere was even a promotional pamphlet to promote the town and it says: \\"the youngest and largest town in Florida...made of largely New England people, where no liquor is sold.\\" The small town built a sawmill in 1884 and produced about $32,000 worth of Lumber. The town started to decline after the sawmill had burned down. The town was also known for the Palma Sola Hotel and general store which was known as the biggest general store between Cedar Key and Key West. Palma Sola was a popular vacation spot and the hotel was often booked with visitors on boat from Tampa and ones on Trains from Jacksonville. The community received its name from a large palm tree which stood on nearby Snead Island. The town was a sleepy town until a bridge was built to the \\"new\\" Palma Sola on Perico Island. A post office called Palma Sola was established in 1881, during the town's heyday. and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1953. Today most of Palma Sola is considered a residential neighborhood of Bradenton although not in the city limits.  Demographics  As of the first census for the town in 1880 it had a population of 962.

The shed remained in use under the successor companies London and North Eastern Railway and British Railways, being significantly modified in the mid 1950s; steam locomotive use at the shed ended in the 1960s. Until the train was selected as a maintenance depot for the new AT300 fleet, the depot was used for diesel locomotive maintenance in the early 20th century. Site history =Doncaster Carr locomotive shed (1876‚Äì2014)= By the 1850s the Great Northern Railway (GNR) had constructed a railway line to Doncaster; in the 1870s the railway facilities at Doncaster were undergoing enlargement, involving the reconstruction of the station, and the move of the locomotive servicing facilities to a site at Doncaster Carr suitable for accommodating around 100 engines. The engine shed was opened on 27 March 1876 with approximately 80 engines brought from the former shed.Doncaster Carr Sheds, LNER Magazine 1927, p.387 \\"Cenotaph\\" automated coaling and sanding stage, The 12 road engine shed was located in primarily agricultural land north of the GNR main line, approximately south-east of the town centre, and well outside the urban extent of the town.Ordnance Survey. 1:10560. 1893‚Äì4 By 1900 the area included extensive sidings along the main line, as well as large wagon repair works to the south-east, south of the main line, and an additional smaller engine shed to the north-east of the main shed.Ordnance Survey. 1:10560. 1893‚Äì4, 1904, 1938, 1956, 1966 By the late 1920s the shed had an associated \\"Cenotaph\\" mechanical coaling plant amongst its facilities.Doncaster Carr Sheds, LNER Magazine 1927, p.388 The shed (then Doncaster Carr Motive Power Depot) was partially reconstructed in the mid 1950s, and the roof replaced. Under British Rail the facility had shed code 36A. By the 1950s the shed was allocated around 170‚Äì180 locomotives, and had sub-sheds at Mexborough (see Mexborough shed), Frodingham, Barnsley and Retford. Steam locomotives were withdrawn from the shed by 1966. Land in the area remained predominantly in railway use through the second half of the 20th century. The land to the north was developed as sidings ('Doncaster Wood Yard sidings') by the 1970s.Ordnance Survey. 1:10000. 1972, 1984, 1992 In 2005 the depot (Doncaster Carr TMD/WRD) was operated by DB Schenker Rail (UK) as a light maintenance depot. =Doncaster Carr IEP depot (2014‚Äì)= In 2009 Hitachi became preferred bidder for the Intercity Express Programme (IEP); a program aiming to procurement mainline high-speed intercity trainsets from the Hitachi A-train family; in 2012 contracts were signed for the first phase of the project, for trains for the Great Western Main Line (GWML), with agreement reached on a second phase for replacement trains for the East Coast Main Line (ECML) ‚Äì as part of the contract Hitachi was required to build a maintenance depot at Doncaster. It was also announced that Doncaster Carr would maintain the new fleets for TransPennine Express and Hull Trains, as these were also announced to be a part of the AT300 product too.

The brief history of Manavista began when Kimball C. Atwood (1853-1934) purchased 265 acres of land that was situated a mile east of the city of Palmetto on the north side of the Manatee River in 1892. The grove consisted of about 96 rows of grapefruit trees. Atwood had an estate across the river in the town of Manatee. The winters of 1894 and 1895 were particularly severe and devastated the citrus industry in the state, driving the citrus belt further southward. It wasn't until 1897 that Atwood was able to procure new trees from the Reasoners, who owned and operated a plant nursery, had recently received them in stock. Grapefruit varieties included Duncan, Royal, and Walter. A post office was opened on May 12, 1898 with the name \\"Manavista\\" attached. The first postmaster under its supervision was Lewis C. Randall. Meanwhile, the grove had bounced back from the two consecutive freezes and by 1915 it was producing 80,000 boxes of grapefruit, 1,200 of which were handled daily. It experienced its peak year in 1927 when 160,000 boxes of grapefruit were processed. The Atwood grove's fame spread to outside the United States. The American ambassador to the United Kingdom regularly purchased crates and the grove's fruit was served to officials in the royal household. The grove also shipped a complimentary crate of fruit to King George V of the United Kingdom (1865-1936) annually until the King's death. In 1934, Kimball Atwood died, and the grove closed soon afterward. The property remained in the possession of the Atwood family until 1968, when it was sold to Simens-Allis, who built a new plant. Eventually, the plant closed and in 2012, Feld Entertainment purchased the property and set up their new headquarters there.

Two horsepower hay burner, with Capt. Horace McElfresh and son. A team boat, horse boat, or horse ferry, is a watercraft powered by horses or mules, generally using a treadmill, which serves as a horse engine. Team boats were popular as ferries in the United States from the mid 1810s to the 1850s.  Types  The first documented horse-powered boat in the United States was built on the Delaware River in 1791 by John Fitch. Lower Market Place, McCallum's Wharf, Quebec, Quebec, July 4, 1829. There are three types of team boats. In one, four or five horses are placed in each side of the boat in a circular treadwheel, and the paddle wheels, arranged like the side wheel steamboat of later days were turned by means of cogs and gearing connected with other cogs on the shaft of the paddle wheels. The horses were hitched to strong timbers and by a forward movement of the feet caused the treadwheel upon which they stood to revolve and thus operate the gear wheels. Another type of team boat uses a \\"horse whim,\\" a type of horse mill. It has a large revolving wheel in the middle, and a center post known as a \\"whim\\" (or horse capstan). The horses, which are attached to the horse whim, walk around in a circle, causing the wheel or capstan to revolve, which in turn rotates gears that rotate the paddles, or bucket wheels. The team boat of this style consisted of two complete hulls, united by a deck or bridge, but separated far enough apart to allow the paddle wheel to be set between them. They are sharp at both ends, and can be propelled backward or forward with equal ease. A third design for team boats was invented in 1819, by Barnabas Langdon. Langdon's turntable design permitted the horses to walk straight ahead instead of in circles. \\"Langdon placed a rotating turntable slightly below the level of the boat's deck; horses stood atop the turntable through large slots in the deck and drove the wheel backward by walking in place. This design eased the burden on the horses, freed up valuable deck space, and allowed the ferry to be built atop one hull.\\" One description of a turntable type team boat using six horses says, \\"The treadmills, on either side, were each trod by three horses always facing in the same direction. To reverse the paddlewheels it was only necessary to stop the horses a minute, and withdraw a drop pin that would reverse the gearing.\\"  The Experiment  Experiment, 1808 horse paddle-boat The Experiment, built sometime around 1807-1810, was an early horse-powered ferry boat. It was a twelve-ton three- mast boat drawing a few feet of water, about 100 feet long by 20 feet beam. Its driving mechanism, an in-water screw, was invented by David Grieve in 1801. The boat was constructed by David Wilkinson (some sources give his name as Varnum) in 1807 to 1810, depending on the source. p. 31 Mr. Varnum Wilkinson, now living (1859), built \\" The Experiment,\\" he thinks in 1809 or 1810. It was propelled by a \\"goose-foot paddle\\" large mechanical screw propeller in the water (instead of a paddle wheel at water surface). The new technology devised by Grieve and Wilkinson was powered by eight horses on a treadmill. The horse boat technology to propel the boat upstream was originally invented by David Grieve and granted a patent February 24, 1801 in the patent category of \\"Boats to ascend rivers\\". The complete recorded patent was lost in the 1836 U.S. Patent Office fire. The novel idea of propelling vessels upstream by the use of a large mechanical screw in the water is now referred to as Ericsson‚Äôs propeller.  Commercial service and ferries  One of the first documented team boats in commercial service in the United States began running a Manhattan-Brooklyn route in 1814. Carrying vehicles, horses, and two hundred humans on a typical run, it could take anywhere from eight to eighteen minutes to finish the East River crossing. Team boats continued to serve New York City until 1824. Team boat ferries were very popular. First, they were thought to be cheaper to operate than any other type of ferry boat, and second, they did not incur fees under the Fulton-Livingston patents monopoly. In ferry service, horses could be stabled on land, and there was no need to feed them on the boat, because the work was intermittent. There were cases in which team boats replaced steam boats for reasons of economy. In 1812, two steam boats designed by Robert Fulton were placed in use in New York, for the Paulus Hook Ferry from the foot of Cortlandt Street, and on the Hoboken Ferry from the foot of Barclay Street. The Juliana, running from Barclay Street, was withdrawn from service, as announced, in favor of the more convenient horse boat. It is almost certain, however, that this retrograde step was taken because of the monopoly enjoyed by Mssrs. Fulton and Livingston for the navigation of the waters of New York State by steam. In 1816, a steamboat company running ferry service between Halifax, Nova Scotia and Dartmouth had the law amended to permit the use of team boats instead. In August 1816, the team boat Moses Rogers in Newburgh, New York began service to Fishkill, New York, carrying wagons, coaches, carriages, horses, and passengers. In 1817, the Union Team Boat ran between Long Bridge at Georgetown and Alexandria, Virginia. In 1821, William Dyer built a team boat serving Portsmouth, Virginia on the Elizabeth River. In 1838, Tremaine's Team Boat, using three horses, operated a ferry service at Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Team boats with eight horses operated on the Ohio River at Cincinnati in 1819, and at Charleston, South Carolina, on the Ashley River in 1818 and 1827. The team boat crossing the Ohio could accommodate a stagecoach driving aboard. Attempts were made with moderate success to ascend the Ohio and Mississippi with teams of horses on board. In 1824 the team boat Genius of Georgia operated on the Savannah River, under Captain William Bird, carrying a cargo of sundries. An 1820 report by the South Carolina Department of Public Works described a five-man boat powered by eight mules; it carried 300 bales of cotton 250 miles in fifteen days at a cost of just $116.25. However, for through traffic, the team boats never passed the experimental stage. The South Ferry horse ferry operating at Albany, New York in 1827 was replaced by a steamboat in 1828. The North Ferry horse ferry at Albany operated from 1831-1841. The team boats on the Delaware River serving Camden, New Jersey stopped for an hour at lunch time to feed the horses. The Ridgeway was a double team boat, propelled by nine horses walking around a circle. She ran from the foot of Cooper Street. There was also a team boat named the Washington; she ran from Market Street, Camden, to Market Street, Philadelphia. Other team boats followed in succession, namely the Phoenix, Constitution, Moses Lancaster, and Independence. The Cooper's Ferry Daybook, 1819-1824, documenting Camden's Point Pleasant Teamboat, survives to this day. Horse powered ferries have also been documented in Wisconsin and New Hampshire. A shipwreck discovered in 1983 in Lake Champlain, the Burlington Bay Horse Ferry, is an example of a turntable team-boat. It served on one of approximately five horse ferry crossings operating on Lake Champlain from about 1820 to 1850. They reached their peak in the 1830s and 1840s, before their 1850s replacement by steamboats. In the 1880s, in New Haven, Missouri and Waverly, Missouri, the Tilda Clara and General Harrison ferries across the Missouri River were powered by four horse teams.Photos of horse ferries, The Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County A ferry powered by horses and mules operated on the Mississippi River at St. Mary, Missouri as recently as 1910.

He lost his post in the July Revolution of 1830, and spent the next six years in prison. Early years Jean Claude Balthazar Victor de Chantelauze was born in Montbrison, Loire, on 10 November 1787. He became known after the first Bourbon Restoration in 1814 by a very liberal brochure on the draft constitution that the conservative senate had to submit to King Louis XVIII. He was then appointed deputy prosecutor in Montbrison. He made a point of resigning during the Hundred Days when Napoleon returned from exile. After the second Restoration this earned him the position of Advocate-General at the court of Lyon on 25 October 1815. He was awarded the cross of the Legion of Honor in 1821. He was appointed Attorney General first at the court of Douai on 21 July 1826, and three months later at the court of Riom. Political career On 17 November 1827 Chantelauze was elected as a deputy for the Loire (Montbrison). There were some difficulties about the election and he did not enter the chamber until 11 February 1828. At the opening session of 1830 Chantelauze was supported by the government in a bid to become President of the Chamber, winning 116 votes. In the secret committee of 15 March 1830 he protested against the proposed hostile address to the government. When Jean Joseph Antoine de Courvoisier resigned, King Charles X offered the Ministry of Justice to Chantelauze, who accepted on 19 May 1830 after much hesitation. Chantelauze was reelected on 23 June 1830. He signed the reactionary July Ordinances on 25 July 1830 without speaking for or against them. Later years During the July Revolution that erupted on 26‚Äì29 July 1830, Chantelauze accompanied the king to Rambouillet, and after the abdication retired to the Tours region. He was arrested and taken to Tours, where he pleaded immunity as a deputy without success. He was jailed, and on 25 August 1830 was taken to the Ch√¢teau de Vincennes. He was tried in front of the Chamber of Peers on 15 December 1830, and on 21 December 1830 was sentenced to life imprisonment, as were Pierre-Denis, Comte de Peyronnet and Martial de Guernon-Ranville. Chantelauze was imprisoned in the Ch√¢teau de Ham. He was released in 1836 when a collective pardon was granted at the instigation of Mol√© ministry. After this he lived in deep retirement. He died in the Ch√¢teau de Beauplan, Pierrelatte, Dr√¥me, on 11 August 1859, aged 71.

The Lithuanians were entrenched in two large bunkers and refused to surrender. After three days of fighting, both bunkers were destroyed with heavy casualties on both sides. As Red Army continued to advance towards Nazi Germany, Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union. The Lithuanians fled the forceful conscription into the Red Army and hid in the forests. A particularly large group, known as the Tiger Detachment (, organized themselves in the Labanoras Forest. A platoon, commanded by Antanas Krinickas, built a large Margis Bunker with trenches south of the Kiauneli≈°kis village in fall 1944. Another bunker, named after Kaunas, was built by men commanded by Apolinaras Jurƒçys in winter 1945. In March 1945, Soviet NKVD sent troops and stribai (members of destruction battalions) from ≈†venƒçionys, ≈†venƒçionƒóliai, Salduti≈°kis to destroy the Kaunas Bunker. The partisans successfully held off initial Soviet attacks, but soon their camp and bunker was surrounded. Majority of the partisans from the Kaunas Bunker managed to break through the Soviet encirclement and escape leaving only seven men behind. When partisans from Margis Bunker came to assistance, the Soviets learned about the existence of the second camp and surrounded it as well. Partisans from Margis Bunker did not attempt to break through and escape the assault. Fierce exchange of fire continued into the second day, when Soviet forces were unexpectedly attacked by 300 men from the Tiger Detachment. Conflicting accounts claim the partisans inside the bunkers believed that it was a clever ruse intended to bring them out of hiding and into an ambush or that the reinforcements believed they were too late and thus did not press further. Either way, the men from the Tiger Detachment retreated leaving the partisans in the bunkers to defend themselves. The seven men inside the Kaunas Bunker started running out of ammunition. Preferring death to being captured by the Soviets, they decided to use the last grenade to kill themselves. Six men were killed by the blast, while the seventh survived. The men inside Margis Bunker continued to resist. The Soviets would toss in grenades, but the partisans would grab them and toss them back to the Russians. The Soviets then brought anti-tank grenades and mortars. The heavy fire effectively buried the bunker preventing ventilation and suffocating everyone inside. On March 14, NKVD brought residents of nearby villages to deal with the bodies. Witnesses counted 300 Soviet bodies. It is known that four Russian officers, including a colonel, were buried in ≈†venƒçionys.

History  Waterbury was a planned company town by the James L. Waterbury Company of Chicago and Minneapolis located within a large citrus development in eastern Manatee County. The development was first proposed in 1914 by James L. Waterbury, a recent transplant to Bradenton. The Waterbury property was originally six square miles just south of the Manatee River, half to the north and half to the south of the intersecting East and West Coast Railroad (today location of State Road 70). The project required over 10,000 acres in the Manatee River valley to be drained. The southern half of the development was to be a town known as Pomelo Park and the northern half was to be the town of Waterbury. In 1918, the beginnings of the grapefruit farm were planted. The town of Waterbury was platted in 1920. It was intended to have 192 building sites over one square mile located in the heart of the grapefruit trees. The Waterbury project gained notoriety locally because the company used dynamite to clear the many pine trees on the land, which was a novel process for its time. By 1922, 650 acres of trees had been planted. A lodge and administrative office for the grapefruit operation had also been built. In 1923, James Waterbury sold his company to Rudolph Haas of Springfield. At that time, the Waterbury grapefruit development was home to over 700 acres of groves, as well as office buildings, laborer housing, stables, and packing houses. The recession that hit Florida in 1926 severely damaged the citrus industry and the Waterbury Grapefruit Company went out of business. In the 1930s, the property was acquired by the State of Florida as part of the Murphy Act. In 1967, the Hunsader family of Wisconsin purchased the land that was platted for the proposed town of Waterbury and developed a tomato farm there. Today the planned site for the town is still part of the Hunsader Farms property, but no original buildings remain.

History  The town of Verna was a small community from 1915 to 1930 built from a stop located on the East and West Coast Railroad which ran from Bradenton in Manatee County to Arcadia in Desoto County. Today its location is marked by the intersection of what is now State Road 70, Verna Bethany Road, and Verna Road. The community was established in 1915 on the former Posey Farm and was originally called St. Claire. Early advertisements for the railroad use this name. However, the name was changed a year later by John Posey, owner of the land and future clerk of the city. He named the community after his daughter, Verna Posey. The post office was established there in February 1916. In 1915 the land deed for the St. Claire School was approved by the Manatee County School Board and by 1918 Verna School opened under teacher Lois Bond. By 1923 there were 16 homes in Verna. By 1925, there was a grocery store owned by F.E. Albritton, garage, post office, hotel, restaurant, train depot, and gas station in the town. The Verna Methodist Episcopal Church was erected in 1926. During the real estate boom of the 1920s, expansion was planned. John Posey and business partner Frank Golden, along with other Bradenton developers such as C.H. Ballard platted new communities adjacent to the town. Subdivisions including Verna Heights, La Verna, and Verna Courts were advertised in newspapers from Tampa to Miami. However, these projects did not come to fruition due to a major economic depression which began in Florida in 1926. In June 1925, the town of Verna was incorporated, but it was not long-lived. In 1927, Florida State Legislature ordered the city to be abolished, which was completed in 1929. The Verna Post Office closed in January 1930 and the school closed at the end of that spring.

The road once stretched from Mendota to Wabasha and was planned in the earliest years of Minnesota Territory before Minnesota became a state. This particular fragment of road, which spans the Cannon River bottomlands, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. It was listed as part of a statewide survey that identified historic fragments of the military wagon roads built between 1850 and 1861. The survey found that a road fragment could be considered historic if it was unpaved, that it is \\"long enough to evoke a sense of destination\\" where an observer at one end could not see the other end, and that the setting of the road had not been intruded upon with recent buildings or roads. When Minnesota became a territory in 1849, Henry Hastings Sibley lobbied the United States Congress for aid for building roads. Congress had supported road building in other territories, and they approved the Minnesota request for the purposes of defense, for benefit of the settlers, and to increase the value of the public lands to be sold to settlers. The Minnesota Road Act of July 1850 appropriated $40,000 to construct four military wagon roads and to survey a fifth. Of that, $5,000 was allocated for a road from Mendota to Wabasha, on the west bank of the Mississippi River. The Mendota to Wabasha road was surveyed and marked by the Corps of Topographical Engineers in 1851 and 1853, but work on the section at the Cannon River did not begin until after 1854, when money was available to build a causeway and a main bridge across the river bottoms. Captain James H. Simpson contracted with Thomas J. Frazier in December 1854 to build a truss bridge, which was finished by September 1855. Simpson also contracted with the firm of Mason and Whipple to build the causeway and a couple smaller bridges, but they were unable to complete the contract. C.R. Read, of Reads Landing, was therefore brought in to finish the job, which was done by the end of 1856. The main Cannon River bridge was damaged by flooding in 1856, and the 1857 federal appropriation only provided $2,000 for repairs, although Captain George Thom insisted that repairs would cost $3,000. The Goodhue County Commissioners repaired the bridge. There were no further federal appropriations after 1857, and the military road program came to an end four years later. Burnside Township and the county assumed maintenance of the road at that point. In 1898 the Minnesota Constitution was amended so the state could fund road construction and other internal improvements. The Minnesota Legislature passed a bill allowing county boards to designate state roads and receive tax funding. The section of road crossing the Cannon River, known as Cannon Bottom Road, was designated State Road 3. With tax revenue available, the county constructed new bridges in 1911 and 1915, and they regraded and graveled the road in 1919. In 1920, a constitutional amendment established a state trunk highway system, and State Road 3 became Trunk Highway 3. A new bridge over the Cannon River was built in 1921. The Minnesota Highway Commissioner found fault with the road's alignment, though, so a completely new alignment was constructed to the west in 1931. This section of road, now part of U.S. Highway 61, shortened the distance by and is still in use today. The old road reverted to the jurisdiction of Burnside Township, which was subsequently annexed by the city of Red Wing in 1971. The section listed on the National Register begins at a junction with Collischan Road on the north river bank. It runs to the southeast, away from the bluffs, and crosses the Cannon River on the 1921 concrete-girder bridge. The National Register-listed section then continues for on a causeway, with two bridges measuring about each, built in 1911 and 1915. The listed section ends at an intersection with the Cannon Valley Trail, formerly the Chicago Great Western Railroad, and then continues on as Cannon Bottom Road, a signed city street. As of 2015 the northern, 1915 bridge has been removed.

First described in 2014, it is known from two extinct species. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that this eye arrangement is the ancestral condition for harvestmen, placing Tetrophthalmi and Cyphophthalmi in a basal position within Opiliones. Classification history In the early 1980s, a tiny fossil was extracted from the Montceau-les-Mines Lagerst√§tte deposit in Eastern France. The fossil went unstudied for more than 30 years before paleontologist Russell Garwood used X-ray computed tomography (CT scans) to investigate the fossil. In 2014, a team led by Garwood identified the specimen as a novel species, Hastocularis argus, named for the 100-eyed giant Argus Panoptes in Greek mythology.http://m.csmonitor.com/Science/2014/0411/Ancient-four-eyed-wonder- resolves-daddy-longleg-mystery According to their analysis, the specimen died, and was rapidly buried approximately 305 million years ago. Before it decayed, its body was surrounded by the mineral siderite, which formed a protective concretion. The specimen subsequently decayed, leaving a void showing a detailed outline of the creature. The CT scan revealed that H. argus had two sets of eyes - one set mounted on the ocularium in the middle of head and one set on its side on the stink glands. Performing comparative analysis on 158 morphological features, Garwood's team determined H. argus was closely related to Eophalangium sheari. The two species were not, however, as closely related to the 270 other species of harvestmen studied. The team determined H. argus and E. sheari shared three features ‚Äì two pairs of eyes, an open gonostome (a part of the reproductive system), and external male genitalia ‚Äì which distinguish them from all other harvestmen. Thus, the two species were classified into a new suborder, Tetrophthalmi. Hastocularis argus and the new suborder Tetrophthalmi help explain how arachnid eyes developed. The classification also helps clarify when side-eyed and fore-head eyed harvestmen split into distinct clades. Phylogeny Phylogenetic analysis of Opiliones In Garwood et al.s phylogenetic tree, the basal Opiliones split into the \\"Phalangida\\" and stem Cyphophthalmi. The Cyphophthalmi stem then diversified into Cyphophthalmi proper and Tetrophthalmi, while the Phalangida split into Laniatores and the \\"Palpatores\\". Finally, the Palpatores diversified into Eupnoi and Dyspnoi. The analysis moves the divergence of the extant suborders from the Devonian Period to the Carboniferous. The opiliones' own divergence is dated to 414 million years ago, and arachnids are estimated to have originated during the late Cambrian to early Ordivician. Genetic analysis performed on a modern Phalangium opilio specimen found a suppressed gene that, if active, would generate a second pair of eyes at the lateral location, providing independent evidence that four eyes is the ancestral condition. Garwood et al. also argue that a Carboniferous harvestmen diversification is more consistent with changes observed in other terrestrial arthropods, which have been linked to high oxygen levels during that period. Another recent phylogeny recovered Hastocularis as an early banching opilionid in the harvestman tree, along with the Cyphophthalmi. Eophalangium, the other genus in Garwood et al.'s Tetrophthalmi was recovered in a polytomy with the remaining oplionids, however.

The United States Department of the Interior murals in Washington D.C., The Homestead and The Oklahoma Land Rush, were painted with oil and tempera on canvas Czestochowski 126. and installed November 1938 by John Steuart Curry. Created during the Great Depression, the murals are the product of President Franklin D. Roosevelt‚Äôs New Deal. The two murals depict events of the time period, the Homestead Acts and the Oklahoma Land Run of 1889. Early sketches of figures and ideas are held by archives located at the Marianna Kistler Beach Museum of Art at Kansas State University. The Homestead This mural is nine foot by 19 feet eight inch. It represents a homestead with the typical features that make up its ideal of blessed peace, happiness, and potential prosperity of ensuring rural life. The Homestead features a mother and her daughter paring potatoes near a small garden for the family meal. A young son holds the fence posts while his father drives them into the ground. An older sister drives the wagon full of spikes while she also cares for the youngest child. Each member of the family is actively working and contributing its energies to the productive whole.Czestochowski 38. Near the bottom left of the mural, roosters, chicks, and chickens peck and feed near the foreground garden as bountiful reminders of their capacity to provide this frontier family with eggs.Czestochowski 39. The Oklahoma Land Rush Just two inches taller than its partner painting, this nine feet two inch by 19 feet eight inch Junker 65 mural represents another historical event from the time period. The Oklahoma Land Rush depicts the Westward Migration in the representation of that famous day‚Äîtwelve o'clock noon on April 22, 1889‚Äîwhen the Oklahoma Territory was opened to homestead settlement and over twenty thousand prospective settlers rushed into the new land to stake their claims. Anxious but looking forward to eventual security, an 1889 pioneer mother, sunbonnet intact, is of greatest importance to the far left foreground of Curry's westward-moving mural. Perched on a broken-down wagon, she clutches her small son while waving and calling out to her certificate-holding husband, who, astride their rearing horse, is to ride on to claim a new farm site. His hellbent competition includes a cyclist riding a high, \\"ordinary\\" safety bicycle from the 1880s and an overweight, overdressed lady in a rocking chair. She rolls back in an open wagon driven frantically by her balding husband, and, if nothing else, lends comic relief to balance the anxious sincerity of the mother on the ground. John Steuart Curry's Oklahoma Land Rush repeated an important theme of the time: history told through the actions of common people. By emphasizing the rush of figures across the land, Curry shared his concern with capturing the energy and vigor of American pioneers. =Kansas State Capital murals= Tragic Prelude, mural by John Steuart Curry, in the Kansas State Capitol One of Curry's most famous works are the murals designed for the Kansas State Capitol, in Topeka, Kansas. In June 1937, newspaper editors raised money to commission John Steuart Curry (who was the most famous artist in Kansas) to paint murals in the statehouse. Curry's design was divided into three themes: first the Settlement of Kansas, which depicted the conquistadors and the Plainsmen; second the Life of a Homesteader, which would depict John Brown; and third, Pastoral Prosperity which would include scenes of modern Kansas. Curry wanted to be free to express his own ideas regarding the murals: \\"I have my own ideas about telling the story of pioneers coming into Kansas. I want to paint this war with nature and I want to paint the things I feel as a native Kansan.\\"Kendall, M. Sue. Rethinking Regionalism: John Steuart Curry and the Kansas Mural Controversy. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1986 Political controversy stalled the completion of the murals. Expensive Italian marble slabs covered the spot in the rotunda where the eight panels depicting scenes from the Life of the Kansas Homesteader were to be painted. The legislative committee refused to move them from the wall to make way for Curry's mural. However, behind the refusal were two real issues with Curry's paintings, the first being that Curry's factual details were incorrect. For instance, \\"they criticized the tails of his animals calling them not natural-like.\\" In Curry's opinion, those problems could be easily fixed. However, with the next issue the committee had an even stronger objection; and that was the image of Kansan abolitionist John Brown, in front of a crowd of people and a tornado. In particular, the committee objected to the blood on John Brown's hands, the prairie fires, and tornadoes. These inclusions were thought by some to show the state in a negative light because Brown, who was executed in 1859 for treason (leading an abolitionist raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia), was considered by some to be a traitor and a murderer. Curry tried to explain that while the blood on Brown's hands was not literal, his acts caused bloodshed, and that the tornado was a symbol of the abolitionist's passion. However, the people of Kansas saw its inclusion as a negative statement about bad weather.KSHS \\"Curry's Statehouse Studies\\" Kansas State Historical Society In his presentation to the people, Curry expressed that he wanted to get into his pictures the irony that is the Kansas people; not a soft, soppy presentation.Dennis, James M. Renegade Regionalists: The Modern Independence of Grant Wood, Thomas Hart Benton, and John Steuart Curry. Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press, 1998. When rejected, Curry in anger left the finished murals unsigned at his death in 1946. Since Curry's death, his murals have come to be regarded as on par with similar works done by his contemporary Thomas Hart Benton.

He noted his interest in studying with Harvey Dunn who Curry said was ‚Äúmaking the illustrators of today.\\" In 1920, Curry met Dunn, and while he did not become one of Dunn‚Äôs students the established artist became a mentor, helping Curry further his illustration education and career. Curry began publishing illustrations in 1921 and continued through 1926 when he took a hiatus from illustration, writing ‚ÄúCame to NY to be an illustrator. Was not a brilliant success. Went to Paris and learned something from M. Schoukhareff of the Russian Academy. Learned something, also, from the Louvre and have been trying since to carry out my ideas of how an American should paint.\\" In 1940 John Curry returned to making illustrations for books and other media, and he contributed to this field until his death in 1946. His last illustrations can be found in John Brown‚Äôs Body: A Poem by Stephen Vincent Ben√©t, published by Limited Editions Club in 1948. My Friend Flicka was originally written as just a short story by Mary O‚ÄôHara while she was living on a ranch in Wyoming. It was later requested by the Lippincott Publishing Company of New York that she make it into a novel. It was published in 1941 and John Steuart Curry contributed fifteen drawings for the illustrations. They were rendered in mostly ink with some pencil and conte crayon. He did one picture with watercolor for the title page of the book. =Book Illustrations= *Cooper, James Fenimore. The Prairie. New York: Limited Editions Club, 1940. *O‚ÄôHara, Mary. My Friend Flicka.

This campaign associated Luckies with the down-home, folksy look of regional art. The American Tobacco Company did not capitalize on the war or use military themes when advertising for their cigarettes. Curry only made two Lucky Strike tobacco ads: *\\"Grading a Pile of Tobacco After Curing\\"- The first Lucky Strike ad features a woman wearing a headscarf sorting tobacco leaves.Life Magazine,1942. *\\"Grading the Lighter Leaf\\"- This ad depicts a farmer sorting and examining tobacco leaves inside a barn. There are four original primary sketches of ideas and the layouts for these Lucky Strike ads in the archives located at the Marianna Kistler Beach Museum of Art at Kansas State University. =Hoover and the Flood= On May 6, 1940, LIFE magazine released Hoover and the Flood: A painting for LIFE, by John Steuart Curry. This editorial was the sixth of eight commissioned installments for LIFE Magazine's American History Series that featured modern American history paintings. John Steuart Curry's Hoover and the Flood painting is an oil on panel and measures 37¬Ω by 63 inches. The painting is currently located at The Morris Museum of Art in Augusta, GA. Curry's LIFE Magazine commission was solely for the reproduction rights to the painting. Since the magazine never intended to purchase Curry's painting there has been little success finding documentation regarding the financial aspects of the commission. Curry's Hoover and the Flood was created to celebrate the humanitarian and relief efforts of Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover before his presidential election in 1928. Curry's painting demonstrates many of the major scenes and events that were associated during the Mississippi Flood of 1927 such as flood waters, National Guardsmen, the Red Cross relief, refugees, stranded farm animals, praying African Americans and a Mississippi riverboat. John Steuart Curry's work often supported the mentalities of the African American population that were common during the first half of the twentieth century. Hoover and the Flood references several of Curry's previous artworks. His use of a centrally positioned African American male figure appears in other works including Freeing of the Slaves (1936), The Fugitive (1924-1936), and Mississippi Noah (1932). War art Important pieces of war art include: *Our Good Earth, 1942, oil on hardboard, Chazen Museum of Art, University of Wisconsin *Farm is a Battleground, Too, 1943, World War II war bond poster, original at Figge Art Museum, Davenport, IA http://www.figgeartmuseum.org/getdoc/afec690e-2d9b-4aad- bd5a-f7d1a880e7cc/C.aspx?page=10 *The Surgeon, ca. 1945, cont√© crayon on paper, War Department commission, Camp Barkeley, TX, US Army medical training, ca. 1945 =Background= The government used posters to advertise as technique during the First World War. The posters bridged a gap between the government and the people by using direct and simple messages. The government‚Äôs plan of advertising via posters was to stir the nation into action by engaging its people‚Äôs hearts and minds. Quite simply, the posters were meant to inform, influence and guide Americans‚Äô behavior toward a certain political ideology. Because these posters were to be a part of the urban environment, they could be placed anywhere. Moreover, artists were told to use objects that could stand for a whole, like a flag signifying a nation or a bomb meaning war, so that they would not require any text on the poster. No poster text was deemed a more effective and efficient technique of advertising. Specifically, posters were to ‚Äútell the truth‚Äù because they engaged all Americans and fostered a social movement among Americans. Sympathetic and realistic representations of the common soldier encouraged American nationalism, such that the common lives of persons were made to be heroic during the war. Two different schools of art did work during this time: Regionalists and Social Realist. Both groups of art had vastly different views, but they did share the common idea of the championing the common man. Therefore, if either group was to make art to persuade people it needed to be done in this manner. Although he openly opposed the possibility of a Second World War, John Steuart Curry's political opinions are not known explicitly. His opinions were a mystery even to his wife. In an interview when asked what Curry's political views were, she told the interviewer that her husband read The Progressive. Matthew Biagell once wrote that \\"subject matter of an important group of paintings[...]as well as statements that he made, suggest strongly that his interests lay in a liberalism of one sort or another.\\" His opinions of military involvement in Europe were believed to be in step with the majority of Americans at this time. \\"Isolationism may have been most pronounced in the landlocked Midwest, but Americans of both sexes, of all ages, religions, and political persuasions, from all ethnic groups and all religions, shared in the postwar years a feeling of apathy toward Europe, not to mention the rest of the wretchedly quarrelsome world, that bordered on disgust.\\" Curry was frustrated by the possibility of war. He saw the war only as a setback in the progress the nation had made since that last world war, and thus ending the progress made in the world of art. Curry warned that the entrance into another world war would kill the renaissance that he had seen reborn after the WWI: \\"After the First World War there began a splendid resurgence in Art in America, and we are in the midst of this movement now-- but war will kill it before it can reach its flowering.\\" Curry had shown his dread of the coming war through his painting The Light of the World which depicted onlookers gazing at a coming storm. It wasn't until after the attack on Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941, which caused the shift in American opinion, that inspired a change in Curry's support of the war. Curry was faced with the dilemma on how to make his work matter. He had the desire to reach a broader audience of people, and for the first time in Curry's career, he expressed a desire to utilize his talents in support of American troops. In 1942, he finished his first work in support of a war. Sponsored by Abbott Laboratories Junker 236 to produce government sanctioned war propaganda, Curry finished his first work in support of any war effort. He submitted an oil titled Our Good Earth to be used in publications. =Our Good Earth= Our Good Earth is a painting and war poster by Curry that highlights the symbolic importance of the heartland to the American war effort. When commissioned to do war art, Reeves Lewenthal, director of Associated American Artists gallery, tried suggesting possible subjects for John Steuart Curry's new sponsorship: \\"Perhaps you can do a heroic figure of a soldier guarding over or fighting for the preservation of all those benefits and advantages we enjoy in our democracy; or perhaps, could be fighting for the preservation of our peaceful, fertile farmlands, can be effectively portrayed in the background; or, perhaps, shadows of out former hero soldiers can drift into the distance behind this forceful foreground figure.... Then again, you might do a nurse-or a flyer-or a marine-or a sailor-in some symbolic composition.\\" Junker 236-237 But Curry had other ideas when he responded with: \\"...it seems very doubtful whether it is strategic or desirable to use fear as the motive in picturing to them the needs of the war program. Our people are patriotic. Thousands of our young men are volunteering before they are drafted. Bond sales are at a high level. Our people expect to win the war and are prepared to pay any price that may be necessary. They do not need to be threatened by some fear complex in order to do their best. They are responding to incentives that are on a much higher plane and more effective than fear.\\" Junker 237 Instead, Curry fell into step with his typical subject matter and painted an agricultural subject. Our Good Earth shows a farmer standing in his field of wheat, flanked on either side by children as wind gusts through the scene. The state of the man, his children, and the bountiful crop register the plenty that the farm is experiencing despite the war overseas. The farmer's face shows his concern for the times ahead, but it does not indicate any intention to depart from his land or his family for the war overseas. Typical of a Curry work, the weather alludes to the underlying stress of the war. As the family stands in the field, a gust of wind rips through the scene trying to uproot the children and disrupt the crops-just as the war threatens the farmer's land and family. When the work was published as a war bond poster the caption \\"Our Good Earth...Keep It Ours\\" was added, inspiring the onlooker to do their part by buying war bonds to \\"Make Every Market Day, Bond Day.\\" Later, the work was used as the cover for a war bond pamphlet. In addition to the \\"Keep It Ours\\" caption, \\"Long May It Wave\\" was placed at the bottom of the pamphlet, referencing the \\"amber waves of grain\\" of the song \\"America the beautiful\\" and the second stanza of the \\"Star Spangled Banner\\". =The Farm Is a Battleground, Too= In October 1942, shortly after he finished Our Good Earth, Curry received an official request from the Office of War Information to make another poster. He was asked to have the poster completed by November 5 of that year. Based upon The Writers‚Äô War Board‚Äôs directive, Curry was to convey that if America lost the war to the Nazis, then the farmers of the nation would become enslaved. Curry, however, argued that the idea to be expressed was a correct assumption of how life was in rural America. He is quoted in a letter to his dealer, Reeves Lewenthal, as saying, ‚ÄúFarmers are exerting all-out effort and working 70 and 80 hours a week. There is no problem as we see it out here in getting farmers to work as hard as they can, for they are doing exactly this.‚Äù Curry then requested that the board consider developing a more positive rural theme and offered to help think of one, too. In doing so, Curry came up with an idea from a sketch he had used in a previous mural idea for the Wisconsin State Fair called, Wisconsin Agriculture Leads to Victory. He believed such a representation would be a better and more positive idea for a poster. Lewenthal agreed. Thus, in The Farm Is a Battleground, Too, he depicts a gigantic farmer who resembles the one in Our Good Earth. He is holding a pitchfork and is standing before two soldiers. He is visually connecting the activities of the farmer to those on the war front. In the background, Curry was shown a tractor and tank, both mobile, and therefore representative of the war and their respective missions. Because he wanted to keep his work as authentic as possible, Curry rejected any ideas that might go against the realities of the farmers‚Äô work. For example, one idea that was suggested by Lewenthal was that the pitchfork be held in the same advancing motion as the soldiers‚Äô guns. Curry objected and said that farming is a skilled profession. Having the pitchfork in such a way would seem strange and wrong. =Combat Art= In 1942 the Corps of Engineers established a War Art Unit, to include both military and civilian artists, in an effort to reveal the realities of war to the nation. Artist for the program were recruited in joint effort by the Associated American Artists organization and the War Department established art committee. Unfortunately a little over six months into the program Congress cut the funds for the art project and the military artists were reassigned to other duties. Some however, continued to produce art through their military career. Additional efforts to document the war came from major companies with a history in supporting both soldiers and artists such as Abbott Laboratories. From 1942-45, Abbott Laboratories helped produce seven different combat art projects. One such project Abbott supported in collaboration with the Surgeon General‚Äôs Office, and focused on producing medical related art. For this they commissioned well-known artists such as Peter Blume, Joseph Hirsch, and John Steuart Curry. John Steuart Curry started his commission in early 1944 at Camp BarkeleyJames M. Myers, CAMP BARKELEY, Handbook of Texas Online (http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qbc02), Uploaded on June 12, 2010. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. eleven miles southwest of Abilene, Texas. During his stay there, he committed himself to becoming one of the soldiers. He wore a uniform, ate, and went on bivouacs with the soldiers. Curry spent most of his time sketching training battalion units during bivouac problems, as well as following teams through their levels of field medical evacuation. He also commonly sketched the soldiers as they maneuvered their way through obstacle and infiltration courses and demonstrations in the ‚ÄúNazi Village,‚Äù and strafing. While at the camp, Curry produced nearly a hundred sketches covering virtually all training exercises, a crayon portrait of Lieut. Col. Edward A. Zimmerman, and even a large oil portrait of Brig. Gen. Roy C. Heflebower, the commanding general of the medical replacement training center. In John Steurt Curry and Curry Family Papers, Smithsonian Archives of American Art.

The book was published in 2008 by Seal Press, with a revised edition released in 2017. Content The book is split up into multiple chapters that each deal with a different period of history. =An Introduction to Transgender Terms and Concepts= This first chapter, however, is an overview of the topic of gender identity and outlines Stryker's definition of common terms and concepts used throughout the work. This chapter also deals with the current arguments and discussions about transgender people. Multiple reviewers noted that Stryker's definition of transgender, as stated in the book as \\"people who move away from the gender they were assigned at birth, people who cross over (trans-) the boundaries constructed by their culture to define and contain their gender\\" forms a historical discussion that allows for a \\"history sensitive to a wide range of identities and experiences\\". =A Hundred Years of Transgender History= The second chapter discusses how the idea of transgender was pathologized from the 1850s through the 1950s by the medical community and how any type of gender nonconformity was treated as an illness. At the same time, the chapter discusses how the earliest forms of the transgender movement began and groups and organizations began to form. During this period, the ideas of sexuality and gender, homosexuality and transgender specifically, were not as clearly defined and often were assumed to be synonymous or at least closely related. Efforts to clearly differentiate gender into its own subject were seen through the actions of people like Magnus Hirschfeld and groups like the self described androgynes that made up the Cercle Hermaphroditos. These social and medical discussions helped to advance the visibility of transgender identity and to bring it into the public sphere. In later decades, groups and publications made by Virginia Prince would also raise the idea of cross- dressing and its relation to other gender subjects. =Transgender Liberation= The third chapter chronicles grassroots organizing of transgender people, and how clashes with police and other regulators led to civil rights protests and riots in the United States, from the 1950s through the early 1970s. Among these events were the Stonewall riots, a demand for equal service at Dewey's Coffee Shop in Philadelphia, a small scale riot at Cooper's Donuts, and the Compton's Cafeteria riot in San Francisco. The riot at Compton's Cafeteria is the earliest documented, large-scale riot by transgender people in the United States. =The Difficult Decades= The fourth chapter analyzes the backlash against the transgender movement, especially within the feminist and LGB movements through the 1970s and 1980s. This backlash came along with the push by transgender groups to have transgender identity listed under the medical diagnostic literature as a curable disorder called Gender Identity Disorder. The coalescence of the transgender community behind this resulted in the formation of several organizations comprising solely female-to-male people, which began to achieve larger mainstream visibility during the period. At the same time, the chapter discusses the effects of the spread of AIDS among the transgender community, especially among persons of color. =The Current Wave= The fifth and final chapter examines the increasing visibility of transgender people from the 1990s through the present, improvements in medical technologies and health resources for transgender people, and acknowledgement of the complexities and subjectivity of gender. Critical reception Clare Tebbutt reviewed Transgender History for Women's History Review, and called the book an \\"important [addition] to US queer history\\", and praised the depth of Stryker's research. In a review for the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Round Table, a division of the American Library Association, Morgan Gwenwald called the book a \\"comprehensive overview of American transgender history from the mid-twentieth century to the present\\", that would be an \\"important addition to any gender studies, gay/lesbian studies or women‚Äôs studies collection.\\" Reese C. Kelly, writing for GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies, described the book as an \\"engaging introduction to transgender history and activism\\" that is able to remain accessible to a wide public audience, even though its length of less than 200 pages ensures that it cannot be considered the \\"definitive text\\" on the subject. Kelly also approved of the extensive background and resources the book gives to its readers, namely a \\"theoretically informed analysis, a reader's guide to steer discussion and research, and a sizeable list of sources and additional resources\\". In a review for the journal Archivaria, Carrie Schmidt said that the book was a \\"well-researched, highly detailed, yet inherently complicated recounting of the history of the transgender movement in the United States\\" and that it was \\"informative without being dry, provided that the reader has an interest in feminism, gender, sexuality, [and] social issues\\". Polare magazine's Tracie O'Keefe noted that while Transgender History is a \\"very digestible volume\\" that acts as a \\"pocket-sized read of American trans history for those who are not academics because it reads so easily\\", it is also \\"an academic reference because it is well referenced\\". O'Keefe also stated their disappointment that the history of transgender identities in Native American culture was not explored in the book. Transgender History was recommended highly by Choice magazine reviewer K. Gedge, who added that the \\"sources, suggested readings, reader's guide, many short profiles of activists, publications, organizations, films, and Web sites\\" included in the book all encouraged readers to \\"research the topic more fully\\".

After completing his bachelor's and master's degrees at University of Cambridge in 2009, Maynard obtained his D.Phil. from University of Oxford at Balliol College in 2013 under the supervision of Roger Heath-Brown. For the 2013‚Äì2014 year, Maynard was a CRM-ISM postdoctoral researcher at the University of Montreal. In 2017, he was appointed Research Professor at Oxford.  Work  In November 2013, Maynard gave a different proof of Yitang Zhang's theorem that there are bounded gaps between primes, and resolved a longstanding conjecture by showing that for any m there are infinitely many intervals of bounded length containing m prime numbers. This work can be seen as progress on the Hardy‚ÄìLittlewood m-tuples conjecture as it establishes that \\"a positive proportion of admissible m-tuples satisfy the prime m-tuples conjecture for every m.\\" Maynard's approach yielded the upper bound :\\\\liminf_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\left(p_{n+1}-p_n\\\\right)\\\\leq 600, which improved significantly upon the best existing bounds due to the Polymath8 project. (In other words, he showed that there are infinitely many prime gaps with size of at most 600.) Subsequently, Polymath8b was created, whose collaborative efforts have reduced the gap size to 246. On 14 April 2014, one year after Zhang's announcement, according to the Polymath project wiki, N had been reduced to 246. Further, assuming the Elliott‚ÄìHalberstam conjecture and, separately, its generalised form, the Polymath project wiki states that N has been reduced to 12 and 6, respectively. In August 2014, Maynard (independently of Ford, Green, Konyagin and Tao) resolved a longstanding conjecture of Erd≈ës on large gaps between primes, and received the largest Erd≈ës prize ($10,000) ever offered. In 2014, he was awarded the SASTRA Ramanujan Prize.. In 2015, he was awarded a Whitehead prize and in 2016 an EMS Prize. In 2016, he showed that, for any given decimal digit, there are infinitely many prime numbers that do not have that digit in their decimal expansion.Maynard, J.: Invent. math.

History  The community of Rye was named after Erasmus Rye, a Virginian who moved to Manatee County while fighting in the Third Seminole War. The Rye community began as a fort which served as protected housing for a small group of militia and their families. The mounted militia helped to capture Native Americans as part of the war effort. After the Third Seminole War, some of the militia's families remained at Rye, establishing orange groves and cattle ranching. The largest homestead belonged to the John Greene Williams family. After his marriage to Mary Williams, Erasmus Rye took over the Williams homestead and became the largest landowner in that area. The developing Rye community was difficult to reach by road, but its residents were well known for their ability to navigate the Manatee River. For a period, Rye was the point of passage for residents in west Manatee County to cross the Manatee River while traveling to the county seat at Pine Level. In 1879 the first bridge across the Manatee River was built in Rye. In 1882, Sam Mitchell, a cattle rancher from Tampa, moved to Rye with plans to develop a subdivision. He opened the community's first store. He applied for the community's Post Office to be named Mitchellville, which was rejected by the Postal Service due to the name having been used elsewhere in Florida. The area briefly became unofficially known as Mitchellville, but officially reverted to Rye by 1884. 1940 US Census enumeration district map showing Rye. By 1897, the population had grown to 72 families, which allowed a second store to open. At its peak, the community was home to a post office, sawmill, gristmill, school, and stores. However, as land transportation developed with the introduction of the railroad and automobiles to Manatee County in the early 20th century, river transportation further decreased, leaving Rye increasingly isolated. On Jan. 3, 1929, the post office was closed and Rye's township was dissolved. In 1988, the last remaining wooden structures which were the original Rye Home and its detached kitchen area were destroyed in a fire. The Rye Family Cemetery can still be found at Rye Preserve.

History  Elwood Park is a neighborhood located at what was a 1500-acre farming community near Oneco on the Braden River. The area was named for J. Elwood Moore, a Sarasota banker and developer of the area who established the New Home Development Company in the mid-1910s. The New Home Development Company advertised the agricultural tracts in the Midwest to Northerners willing to cultivate the land and Moore provided the training and supplies needed. By 1918, several farms had been established at the site and a shell road was laid to connect Elwood Park to the nearest town of Manatee. By 1921, the Elwood Park settlement was home to 50 people. In 1923, Carl Haselton purchased the property from Elwood Moore with plans to expand the agricultural tracts available there as well as develop a large subdivision known as Elwood Park Manor. A new schoolhouse and sawmill were built by Haselton to attract residents. However, the development of the neighborhood, which included plans for an amusement park and lavish amenities, was hampered by the Florida real estate bust in 1927. 1940 US Census enumeration district map of Manatee County showing the location of Elwood Park. Although still largely rural and home to a few smaller farms and plant nurseries, Elwood Park had experienced independent residential development since the 1950s, but the former subdivision plans were never brought to fruition.

The film stars Ethan Hawke and Emma Watson, with David Thewlis, Lothaire Bluteau, Dale Dickey, David Dencik, Peter MacNeill, Devon Bostick, and Aaron Ashmore in supporting roles. The film had its world premiere at the San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival on September 18, 2015. It was released in the United States on October 9, 2015, by The Weinstein Company. The film received mostly negative reviews from critics. Plot The film takes place in Minnesota, in 1990. Detective Bruce Kenner (Ethan Hawke) investigates the case of John Gray (David Dencik), who admits to sexually abusing his 17-year-old daughter Angela (Emma Watson) but has no recollection of the abuse. They seek the help of Professor Kenneth Raines (David Thewlis) to use recovered-memory therapy on John Gray to retrieve his memories, and come to suspect that their colleague Detective George Nesbitt (Aaron Ashmore) is involved. They detain him but fail to find evidence against him. Detectives suspect a satanic cult is involved because of Angela's testimony, in which Angela says that she was abused by people in masks and someone took pictures of it. Bruce and Kenneth meet Angela's estranged brother Roy Gray (Devon Bostick) to inquire about why he left the house. Using the regression technique on him, he recalls hooded figures entering his room while he was young. Bruce and Kenneth suspect Roy's grandmother, Rose Gray (Dale Dickey), has some involvement but find nothing after a search of her house. Meanwhile, Bruce begins having nightmares involving satanic rituals. Angela tells him that the cult is out to kill her as she has shown her demonic mark to him and that he is in danger as well. She tells him that her mother received miscellaneous calls and saw strange figures staring at her in the street before she met with an accident. Bruce starts to experience the same things and his nightmares increase in intensity. Rose jumps from the window of her house after seeing ghostly figures, injuring herself. Bruce meets Angela in the church's cemetery to reassure her and after an emotional outburst, she kisses him. Shocked, Bruce leaves her there and returns to his home. He sees a soup advertisement on the street and recognizes the woman in it as the one he sees in his nightmares. He concludes that his imagination has run away with him. He tells Kenneth that all these past memories are induced by therapy and the whole situation is just the result of mass hysteria. Though the professor is initially resistant to the idea, he too comes to suspect that these memories were not real. Bruce is attacked by two hooded figures who finally reveal themselves as George and their colleague, Farrell (Aaron Abrams). George was seeking revenge after Bruce detained him as a child molester and ruined his career. Bruce offers to forget the whole situation if George tells him everything he knows. After George reveals things, Bruce confronts Angela about her abuse and she insists she told the truth. Finally Bruce concludes that she was fabricating everything from the beginning as she wanted to escape from her family, whom she thinks are responsible for her mother's death. She wanted to elope with George, as they had a sexual relationship for some time, but he refused to elope with a minor. Angela accused her father in order to escape the house. When Bruce confronts her, she tells him that no one is going to believe him, especially if she tells them that they kissed in the cemetery. Bruce tells John everything but John decides to take the blame and pleads guilty in order to rescue Angela and hopes that she will forgive him one day for being a bad father. The film ends with a statement that many cases like this were reported before the satanic abuse hysteria faded.

Flanked by Bradenton to the north and Oneco to the south, Cedar Hammock was a hardwood hammock which became a popular location for truck farming in the early 20th century.  History  Many residents of Bradenton maintained farms in Cedar Hammock. One of a few named hammocks in the area, Cedar Hammock was about 6,000 acres but only partially farm-able due to large areas of wetland. The hammock was home to several farms which grew onions, cabbage, potatoes, and other produce. Until 1906 when a drain was dug to Ware‚Äôs Creek, much of the area was water-logged by several feet. The Cedar Hammock area did not start to experience large residential growth until the late 1940s as trailer parks began to open on former farmland along the Tamiami Trail. In 1950, the Cedar Hammock Civic Association was founded by residents to promote improvement of the area. In 1952, the association and area residents waged and won a battle against the city over Bradenton developing a garbage dump in Cedar Hammock.

Overview In 1923 or 1924, a mill was built at Willow by the McGowin-Foshee Lumber Company from Alabama. The company leased 54,000 acres of land for logging. James I. Robbins, Bruce Robbins and James A. Robbins bought it in 1926. The Robbinses also bought 40,000 acres of woodlands that ran south to where State Road 70 is today. The area is believed to have included a sawmill, turpentine still, a planer mill, a dry kiln, Robbins family home, general store (known as the commissary), 75 to 80 worker houses with garden plots, a house of prostitution located on the Little Manatee River, Snowden's filling station, a post office constructed in 1889, a railroad depot with a water tower and a church, school and juke joint located in the black section of town. There was a narrow gauge railroad which had 3 engines, a service car and about 30 logging cars equipped with no brakes. At its height, as much as 50,000 board feet a day was cut. There were around 250 workers. They were paid in scrips (small round tokens) that were to be spent in the commissary and were also accepted in the house of prostitution. Willow was separated into white and black sections. The white section was the south end and the black section was the north end. The black children went to the school in Willow and the white children went to school north in the town of Wimauma. The town failed with the onset of the Great Depression as the price of lumber dropped and the business moved to Tampa in 1937. The business's steam engine from its sawmill is on display at the Robbins Manufacturing Co., located in Tampa on Nebraska Avenue. A railroad single truss bridge crossing the Little Manatee River built in 1913 by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad Company remains, as do bare foundations of some of the old buildings. The railroad bridge needs a significant amount of repair before it can be used again and some of the rails leading to it on the south side have been removed, so that trains can not currently travel across it. On the north side of the railroad bridge, at about Saffold Road, all of the rails have been removed from the rest of this route north to Durant. This abandonment occurred in 1986. At Willow, there is a railroad spur that leads east off of the mainline to a Florida Power & Light Company plant. CSX Transportation provides current rail service to the plant. , the Florida Railroad Museum was expanding its facilities in Willow where restoration and repair work is conducted. There is a new railroad depot now at Willow built by the Florida Railroad Museum. The Museum has put a fence around the depot and its maintenance facilities at Willow and has installed security cameras. On weekends, some of the museum‚Äôs volunteers who live in other distant towns will stay overnight in Willow in the restored passenger car sleepers on Friday and Saturday nights so they can work at the museum for the entire weekend.

The school's vice principal, Kang Min-kyu, who had been rescued from the ferry, died by suicide a few days after the disaster.

Post-war, he worked for MI6 (until 1947) and then, presumably, for the CIA. Buchardt was never prosecuted, being one of the agents of more sinister reputation used by the West after the war. Studies and 1930s Of Baltic German origin, Buchardt studied at the German Gymnasium in Riga, Latvia and law at the University of Berlin and University of Jena. His thesis was titled \\"The Rights of National Minorities in Latvia and Its International Importance and Administration\\". He joined the SA in October 1933, but left the following year, finding it to be too plebeian.Walters, Chapter 7, pp. 235-239 Having completed his studies, Buchardt returned to Riga, where he tried to organize a national German-Baltic movement under the leadership of Erhard Kroeger. Buchardt funded and contributed to the pro-Nazi newspaper Rigaschen Rundschau, which was closed by the Latvian authorities in May 1934 because it had too many connections with Nazi Germany. This plunged Buchardt into financial difficulties, so he became a lawyer for a marketing company in Germany, and then the economics head of the Baltic Institute. SS career While working at the University of K√∂nigsberg, he met Franz Six, the future leader of Vorkommando Moskau. On Six's advice, Buchardt was recruited by the Sicherheitsdienst (SD, the SS intelligence service), working under Six's command. He studied the topography and economy of the Soviet Union, and the distribution of Jews who lived there. By the late 1930s, he held a prestigious position at the Wannsee Institut, the German center for studies of the Soviet Union. By the time of the invasion of Poland, the 30-year-old Buchardt was an Obersturmf√ºhrer and the head of a small group of German-Baltic SS officers deployed to the Port of Gdynia to loot its archives, museums and libraries. The following year, he was assigned to the Office for the Resettlement of Poles and Jews in Pozna≈Ñ, where he classified the level of \\"Germanicness\\" of various sectors of the Polish population on a scale of 1 to 5. In 1940, Buchardt was promoted to head of the SD in Lublin, where he worked under Odilo Globocnik and began participating directly in the Holocaust. Buchardt carried out similar work in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ in February 1941, this time reporting directly to the Reich Security Main Office. On the eve of Operation Barbarossa (June 1941), Buchardt was recalled and, in order to have \\"blood experience\\" rather than merely be a \\"desk scholar\\", he was assigned to Vorkommando Moskau of Einsatzgruppe B. He served as the liaison officer between Franz Six and the head of Einsatzgruppe B, Arthur Nebe. Following the start of the offensive against Moscow in October 1941, he was promoted to head of Vorkommando Moskau the following month. When the Red Army repelled the assault against Moscow, Buchardt was posted back to ≈Å√≥d≈∫ in January 1942, where he continued his work as head of the local SD. From January to September 1942, he supervised the deportation of about 80,000 Jews and Romanis to Che≈Çmno extermination camp. In February 1943, Buchardt succeeded as commander of Einsatzkommando 9 of Einsatzgruppe B. He was in charge of murder actions near Vitebsk. Buchardt's unit was likely responsible for tens of thousands of victims. Buchardt was awarded the Iron Cross First Class and the War Merit Cross. In June 1944, he was promoted to Obersturmbannf√ºhrer. Posted to Berlin, Buchardt now headed Amt III B 2 of the RSHA, which specialized in racial and ethnic matters. He was under the command of Otto Ohlendorf, who headed Amt III. From December 1944, Buchardt also headed Sonderkommando Ost, which gathered intelligence on Russian personnel living in German territory, including members of General Andrey Vlasov's collaborationist Russian Liberation Army. After the war With defeat imminent by April 1945, the head, Otto Ohlendorf, had set up an SD underground movement called Bundschuh (Tied Shoe), named after the Bundschuh movement. The Bundschuh was to serve as a Europe-wide information network of \\"high-grade\\" agents that could be used by sabotage and terrorist organizations as they waged a guerrilla war against the Allies. Ohlendorf appointed Buchardt as leader of the southeastern sector of the network, and he was sent to Karlsbad. However, the events of the war moved too quickly for the Bundschuh plotters, and Buchardt had to retreat 200 miles to the Austrian-German border. Shortly after the war, he was captured by American troops and transferred to the British, who held him at the POW camp in Rimini. During his detention, Buchardt produced a document entitled \\"The Handling of the Russian Problem during the Period of the Nazi Regime in Germany\\", which detailed his espionage activities in Eastern Europe and emphasized the importance of native collaborators in SS operations. The document, which laid the groundwork for MI6 operations in Eastern Europe, allowed Buchardt to escape justice and be employed by MI6. In 1947, MI6 dropped Buchardt, who then offered his services to the United States. Presumably, according to Guy Walters (2009), the United States accepted. A March 1950 report by the U.S. Counterintelligence Corps (CIC) noted that Buchardt \\"may be presently employed by an American intelligence agency\\", presumably the CIA. The CIC report was created to warn United States European Command (EUCOM) of a possible trial being brought against Buchardt by the Bavarian Land Indemnity Office. Buchardt was never brought to trial for any of his crimes. Friedrich Buchardt can be regarded as the most murderous Nazi employed by the Allies after the war. He lived out most of his days in Heidelberg and died quietly in Nu√übach on 20 December 1982.This article incorporates information from the corresponding article in the French Wikipedia Bibliography * Matthias Schr√∂der: Deutschbaltische SS-F√ºhrer und Andrej Vlasov 1942-1945: ‚ÄûRu√üland kann nur von Russen besiegt werden‚Äú: Erhard Kroeger, Friedrich Buchardt und die ‚ÄûRussische Befreiungsarmee‚Äú.

His historical reference works were considered 'of inestimable value in Canadian studies'. Canadian professor of political economy Harold Innis (1894 ‚Äì 1952) was influenced by a maxim of the then McMaster University professor Wallace, 'that the economic interpretation of history is not the only interpretation but is the deepest interpretation'. __TOC__ Professional contributions Dr Wallace was educated at Toronto and Oxford (Master of Arts) universities, and taught history (1906 ‚Äì 1920) at the universities of Western Ontario, McMaster and Toronto. In 1920 he became an assistant librarian, then in 1923, the librarian at the University of Toronto until his retirement in 1954 with title Chief Librarian. It is given Wallace in total wrote over thirty books and hundreds of articles. The works were not without its critics. Laura Secord is considered a heroine of the War of 1812, a war between the United States of America and Great Britain in Upper Canada (1812 ‚Äì 1814). Wallace's 1932 study downplayed the importance of her contributions in that war and resulted in great debate: of those contributions, the emerging professional historian, and subsequent interpretive gender bias by historians.In The Encyclopedia of the War of 1812 as reviewed by Stickney, discusses Wallace's error and its occasional resurfacing in literature. Laura Secord's warning to the British resulted in an ambush of US military and their defeat at Beaver Dams on 24 June 1813. It was not until the 1960s that John Moir discovered two accounts from Lieutenant Fitzgibbon that proved Secord's claim of meeting prior to Fitzgibbon's Indian scouts being deployed and forewarning of the attack. This information was not found by Wallace in 1932. Source: Stickney (citation below). Wallace was the founder and first editor (1920 ‚Äì 1930) of the Canadian Historical Review, editor (1923 ‚Äì 1943), president (1943 ‚Äì 1948), and honorary president (1963 ‚Äì 1970) of the Champlain Society, honorary editor (1937 ‚Äì 1945) of the Royal Society of Canada, and a long-standing member of the Bibliographical Society of Canada. One of Wallace's long-term interests was the history of the famous North West Company and its partners, whose careers he investigated in minute detail. The \\"Biographical Dictionary of the Nor'Westers\\", published as part of his Documents Relating to the North West Company (1934), is full of evidence of the extensive correspondence he carried on with descendants of the partners, trying to locate new letters, journals and account books. Although articles in the Dictionary of Canadian Biography have expanded knowledge of some of the Company's partners, Wallace's work remains a fundamental source. One of his most important discoveries, near the end of his active career, was the correspondence of the Company's partner √Üneas Cameron, then in the possession of descendants in Scotland and now at the Hudson's Bay Company Archives in Winnipeg. This collection of manuscripts was a key source for Elaine A. Mitchell's Fort Temiskaming and the Fur Trade (1977, University of Toronto Press). =Writings= Wallace was the author or editor of many noted printed materials, including: * Review of historical publications relating to Canada (1908, Volume 12) * The United Empire Loyalists: A chronicle of the Great Migration (1914) * The Family Compact: A chronicle of the Rebellion in Upper Canada (1915), Glasgow, Brook, Toronto, 172 pages, relating to the small group of men exercising political, economic and judicial power in pre- confederation Ontario * The Patriotes of '37: a chronicle of the Lower Canadian rebellion (1916), original written by Alfred D.

(n√©e Kilborn) Stewart) were married in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on Thursday, 28 June 1883. Stewart's Scottish-born father was a Baptist pastor and teacher in Ontario. The Reverend William George Wallace MA DD was part of the officers of the inaugural general council in Toronto in June 1925 for the United Church. Their son William Stewart Wallace was born on Monday, 23 June 1884 in Georgetown. Aged 29, on 24 October 1913 in Ontario, Wallace married Isabel Dora Graeme Robertson (b. 27 October 1883, Toronto), the daughter of James Alexander and Julia Delmage (n√©e Carry) Robertson. They had two children, Marcia and Ian.

In September 2010 she was indicted for giving false mammogram results for as many as 1,289 women, 10 of which later were reported to have breast cancer. During the process, at least two women died. According to Rabb Wilkerson, she entered the data herself. Trial During the trial, one of the victims accused Rapraeger of giving her a negative result in December 2009. Two months later, she discovered that she had breast cancer. Rachael's defense attorney, Floyd Buford, have argued that the court had only one copy of the negative mammograms, which might make his defense harder. During the same trial another woman, named Miriam Mizell, said that she had to do chemotherapy twice as a result of her initial misdiagnosis; the diagnosis Rapraeger said was negative. Conviction Rapraeger was initially pleaded not guilty, but then was convicted by Judge Katherine Lumsden of 10 counts of reckless conduct and 10 count of computer fraud because at least 10 women under her care had breast cancer. The judge set her free on $50,000 bail and then scheduled a second court date for April 2014. Currently she serves a year of probation and 160 days in federal detention center.

With e-commerce on the rise, consumers will have the ability to choose whatever brands they want, and with consumer trends moving more towards purchasing products from socially responsible companies, the profit margins could experience substantial changes. For instance, The Social Responsibility Journal recently performed a research study concerning consumers' perception of companies who participate in corporate social responsibility. The results were as follows: \\"consumers perceived greater benefit and value in the offer of the socially responsible firm, and were showed to be willing to pay 10 percent more for its product, judging this price differential as being fair.\\" Simply stated, consumers were willing to pay additional money for a product, if the product was produced by a \\"socially responsible company\\". This example of change in consumer preference helps to confirm the economic benefit CSR implementation will bring to companies who instate it. Concerns Due to the aforementioned changing economic environment and the modified consumer purchasing habits, implementation of CSR appears to extremely beneficial to any company. Yet for many executives, the question of CSR implementation raises concerns. Milton Friedman brings to mind a valid argument, saying, by implementing CSR, \\"the corporate executive would be spending someone else's money for a general social interest. Insofar as his actions in accord with his \\"social responsibility\\" reduce returns to stockholders, he is spending their money. Insofar as his actions raise the price to customers, he is spending the customers' money.

History Henry Bardolph (ca.1854 ‚Äì 22 June 1933) and Mary Bardolph (n√©e Taggart) had five sons, and lived at Manly, New South Wales, where they ran a refreshment room or wine bar. They moved to Victoria, where two sons (Donald Francis Bardolph and Harold Travers Bardolph) died of pneumonic influenza within a few days of each other in the epidemic of 1919, aged 31 and 28 respectively. The family moved to Adelaide around 1919; Henry set up in business as building contractor, notably responsible for the Unley Oval grandstand. Their youngest son, (Clement Patrick) Charles Bardolph, died in Adelaide in September 1926 aged 29 years. Doug worked as a journalist and proprietor of the Unley News. He edited and published the South Australian Worker from 1930 to 1933; his brother Ken Bardolph published the Labor Weekly from 1931 to 1934. Both were members of the Labor Party and high-profile operators in the Union movement. After a series of unsworn allegations of collusion and vote buying at a preselection ballot, a three-man committee of enquiry (Sampson, Burgess and Grealy) had both brothers sacked from the A.L.P. They, with other disaffected unionists, founded a South Australian chapter of the Lang Labor Party, with Doug as President. A nice summary of the rivalry within the A.L.P. At a time of high and rising unemployment among the working classes, and dissatisfaction with both established political parties, the Lang message found ready acceptance. At the 1933 election, Lang Labor candidates Doug Bardolph, Bob Dale (who joined Lang Labor while a member for Sturt) and Tom Howard won all three seats in the multi-member Adelaide electorate. Other seats they contested were Port Adelaide, West Torrens and Legislative Council District No. 1. The A.L.P. applied to the Court of Disputed Returns to have the Adelaide election results overturned on various grounds, but failed. In June 1934 the three South Australian Labor parties (A.L.P., Parliamentary Labor Party and Lang Labor) achieved a degree of unity, one of the prices of which was the re-admission of all expelled members, and Doug rejoined, but was disenfranchised in August 1935 when he refused to pay the amount of \\"sustentation fee\\" (a levy on A.L.P. parliamentarians) demanded of him. At the 1938 election, Doug, as a \\"Labor\\" candidate, independent of the A.L.P., contested and won the seat of Adelaide, which had become a single-member electorate. He was one of 14 of 39 lower house MPs at the election to be elected as an independent, which as a grouping won 40 percent of the primary vote, more than either of the major parties. Tom Stott was the de facto leader of the independent caucus within parliament. At the 1944 election he, again as an independent \\"Labor\\"Bardolph always listed as \\"Labor\\" not \\"Independent Labor\\", though that label has frequently been applied to him. candidate, received the largest number of primary votes on 43.5 percent, but the A.L.P. candidate R. A. Dale on 37.2 percent won after Communist Alf Watt's preferences were distributed from their 19.4 percent vote, a South Australian Communist record. He stood for the same seat at the 1947 and 1950 elections, but received progressively lower support. He died of cancer in Croydon the following year.

Biography Born in Burdusaci, BacƒÉu County, his mother Catinca MotƒÉ»ô (n√©e Chiriac) was the daughter of »òtefanache Chiriac, a local official of Greek origin from the nearby village of Ursa. Her husband, the postelnic Dumitrache MotƒÉ»ô, died sixteen years before Zeletin's birth. The latter's father is unknown (one possibility is the local mayor and well-off landowner Neculache BrƒÉescu), and he remained sensitive to the fact of his illegitimate birth, adopting a pseudonym (after the Zeletin River that passes through Burdusaci) to distance himself from his mother's husband. He grew up in a peasant family of the bourgeoisie, which he would later analyze in his work. Mihai Sorin RƒÉdulescu, \\"O carte despre »òtefan Zeletin\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 39/2002 He attended Codreanu High School in B√¢rlad and the theological seminary in Roman. His tertiary studies took place at the University of Ia»ôi (1906), of Berlin (1907‚Äì1908), Paris (1909‚Äì1910), Leipzig (1910), Berlin (1910‚Äì1911) and Erlangen (1911). After taking his doctorate from the latter university in 1912, on the subject of idealism in contemporary English philosophy and advised by Richard Falckenberg,Constandache, p.289 he returned to Romania and taught German at Codreanu. He started publishing soon after, with Evanghelia naturii (\\"The Gospel of Nature\\") coming out at Ia»ôi in 1915, and Din »õara mƒÉgarilor (\\"From the Country of the Donkeys\\") appearing in 1916. An allegorical work about a population of \\"donkeys\\" that borders the Bulgarians, it drew an angry response from Nicolae Iorga, who signed his review \\"someone who is not a donkey\\"; others praised the pamphlet for its insightful analysis of Romanian society.Ersoy, p.199 One scope of the work was to ridicule Romanian pretensions over Southern Dobruja, which the country had gained as a result of the Second Balkan War. George Ungureanu, \\"Problema Cadrilaterului - Diferendum territorial »ôi repere imagologice (1913-1940)\\", Restituiri, 3/2007 He moved to the national capital Bucharest in 1920, continuing to work as a German teacher, at Mihai Viteazul High School. His most important volume of sociology, Burghezia rom√¢nƒÉ (\\"The Romanian Bourgeoisie\\"), was published in 1925. Two years later, he became a philosophy professor at the University of Ia»ôi. His last book, Nirvana (1928), deals with his understanding of philosophy as correlated with poetry, with philosophy's influence on his outlook and its being a source of inspiration for him. The work revisited themes found in the earlier Evanghelia naturii.Constandache, p.290 A sympathizer of the National Liberal Party, with leading member VintilƒÉ BrƒÉtianu a backer of his theories, Zeletin nevertheless joined the People's Party. He carried on a correspondence with several prominent intellectuals, including Iorga, Vasile Bogrea, Garabet IbrƒÉileanu, Gheorghe I. BrƒÉtianu, Nicolae Bagdasar, and his close friend Cezar Papacostea. He became gravely ill in 1930 and died four years later. He was buried in Bucharest's Sf√¢nta Vineri Cemetery by his brother Dimitrie MotƒÉ»ô, aided by Papacostea and Bagdasar. He never married and had no children.Zeletin, p.47 A popular theorist of neoliberalism in the 1930s and 1940s, his ideas were shunned after the onset of the Communist regime in 1947. His works again began to see publication as part of anthologies in the 1970s, when his work on social development theory was re-evaluated. Following the 1989 fall of communism, his work reappeared in proper form and his ideas reentered debates about political ideology and national identity.Ersoy, p.198 Work Intellectual debates in interwar Romania were dominated by \\"traditionalists\\", who argued that the country should look to its past for its road to development; and \\"Europeanists\\", who said the industrialized and urbanized West pointed the economic and social way forward. Among the latter camp, while Eugen Lovinescu wrote about the transformative power of ideas, Zeletin focused on the importance of economics in Burghezia rom√¢nƒÉ.Hitchins 2013, p.10 There, he argued that the 1829 Treaty of Adrianople had loosened the Danubian Principalities from the constricting influence of long Ottoman domination, producing the fundamental economic changes that gave rise to modern Romania.Hitchins 2014, p.162 He pointed out how, following the 1859 Union of the Principalities, massive Western investment had led to the emergence of a bourgeois middle class composed of boyars who had turned to trade, and of a capitalist economy. Moreover, he argued that continued industrialization and adoption of European technology, guided by this class, were necessary for Romania to avoid retrenchment.Deletant, p.88-89 He drew on the theories of Werner Sombart, who posited that foreigners bring capitalism to countries embarking on a course of modernization, which at a later stage rebel against perceived foreign domination.Petreu, p.193 Zeletin placed early-1920s Romania at this second stage, thus explaining the \\"nationalism of reaction\\" that was \\"xenophobic, in particular anti-Semitic\\", directed against the country's Jewish community.Petreu, p.194 Prophetically, he suggested that Romanians would \\"attempt to emancipate themselves from foreign patronage, in order to live on their own strength\\"; he died before the worst of the country's xenophobic and anti-Semitic reaction had displayed itself.Petreu, p.194-95 He saw the liberal forms the country had adopted as being not artificial, but well-adapted to his society's current stage of development. Adopting a semi-Marxist discourse, Zeletin held that modern capitalism was a \\"historical necessity\\" both unavoidable and not subject to criticism.Mishkova and Daskalov, p.44 By contrast, he viewed traditional Romanian culture as reactionary.Mishkova and Daskalov, p.45 Among Burghezia rom√¢nƒÉ's admirers were IbrƒÉileanu, Tudor Vianu, Alexandru Claudian and Constantin Noica. In Neoliberalismul (1927), he proposed a scientific definition of neoliberalism, enumerated its effects and identified the impediments to its gaining political currency in Romania-- popular prejudice on the one hand, and on the other, doctrines such as Junimism, nationalism, Poporanism and socialism. Constantin RƒÉdulescu-Motru, Nae Ionescu, Virgil Madgearu and Nicolae Ro»ôu accused him of holding materialist, Marxist or socialist views.

It is located on Parrish Street. It was home to Mechanics and Farmers Bank and North Carolina Mutual. History During a time period when disenfranchising blacks and openly violating their rights was common, the black populations of Durham were making strides in business that challenged the legitimacy of white supremacy. Black owned business in Durham can be traced back to the efforts of two African American entrepreneurs: John Merrick and Charles Spaulding. This duo provided the leadership and initiative necessary for the beginnings of Black Wall Street. Though able to increase African American wealth, Black Wall Street did not distribute this new found wealth equally within Durham‚Äôs Black community, Hayti. The region also promoted basic social restructuring for blacks, but did not contribute to desegregation efforts. Memorial sign of Black Wall Street in Durham Downtown =Historical context= The southern United States were left in tumult in the few decades of Reconstruction following the Civil War. During the late 1800s, most of these southern regions were rebuilding infrastructure damaged by war. Racial tensions were at an all- time high, due to the recent emancipation of all black slaves, and the new economic and social competition they represented in many whites‚Äô eyes. But though these African Americans had been freed, their quality of life saw little improvement. Estimates from government officials say almost 85% of blacks were living below the poverty line during the late 1800s. Automatically placed at the bottom of the social ladder, blacks were denied virtually all rights afforded to whites. Major figures The emergence of John Merrick changed the identity of black business men. Merrick was able to reach prominence in his community through his longstanding friendship with Washington Duke. Originally a barber by profession, Merrick gained enough money through income and loans to open North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance, which was later expanded with the efforts of Charles Spaulding. Serving as the president of North Carolina Mutual starting in 1923, Spaulding enjoyed the reputation as America‚Äôs leading black businessman. In 1900, when Spaulding became general manager, NC Mutual was on the brink of failure. By 1910 the company was titled as \\"the world's largest Negro business.\\" Spaulding and two of the original founders, John Merrick and Dr. Aaron M. Moore (Spaulding's uncle), were heralded in the Afro-American community as the \\"Triumvirate,\\" the epitome of Booker T. Washington's \\"black captains of industry.\\" By channeling their success to providing employment for fellow African Americans, these pioneering figures of Black Wall Street stimulated its economic expansion. =Location= Black Wall Street was a four block district on Parrish Street nicknamed in reference to the district of New York City. Although the term ‚ÄúBlack Wall Street‚Äù did not become prevalent until the late fifties, its identity as an economic powerhouse for blacks was apparent since the late 1800s. Numerous other cities in the south had similar black economic centers, including Tulsa. Parrish Street bordered the Hayti community, Durham‚Äôs main African American residential region. The two areas together served as the center of black life in Durham. Emergence Clashes between white and black communities throughout the south during this time period were practically routine occurrences, but this was generally not the case in Durham. In his visit to Durham, Booker T. Washington said ‚ÄúOf all the southern cities I have visited I found here the sanest attitude of the white people toward the blacks.‚Äù Relationship with white population The progress of the black business sphere was directly linked to the tolerance and helpfulness of certain elite whites in the area, namely Julian Carr, Washington Duke, and James Duke. This key factor is what differentiated Durham‚Äôs racial community from a number of other prominent southern cities. This help from the white populace came in two forms: direct capital investment and racial tolerance. That said, Julian Carr was a known white supremacist who encouraged violence against black people, supporting the Wilmington Massacre of 1898. The first form, investment, was the key reason as to how Black Wall Street came to be. Merrick‚Äôs original insurance company was partially funded by his long standing friend Washington Duke and white capitalist, Julian Carr. At the time, these ventures were recorded as the largest investment by a white man in a black enterprise. White bankers even aided in the organization of the first Negro bank. By bridging the gap between post-Civil War to current African Americans, white industrialists paved a path for blacks to continue expanding Black Wall Street. =Duke family= The Duke family was actively involved in funding a number of the enterprises on Black Wall Street. Seen as the quintessential southern business men, the Dukes were a highly revered family that made a fortune from establishing Durham as the tobacco capital of the world. Often cited as one of the key advantages for Durham‚Äôs black business sphere, the positive relationship between this white elite family and black entrepreneurs allowed direct capital to flow from the white economic sphere to the African American sphere. This openly positive attitude towards the black community, stemmed from Washington Duke‚Äôs original opposition to slavery during the Civil War. Frequently characterized by local historians, as ‚Äúphilanthropic, accommodating, and welcoming,‚Äù Washington Duke believed that economic progress should not be marred by skin color. Often found directly giving personal advice to Merrick and Spaulding, the Dukes did not isolate themselves from the black half of the city unlike other contemporary industrial moguls. James B. Duke once quoted about the status of Durham: ‚ÄúDurham, as a city, must be holistically judged for its economic merit. This means we musn‚Äôt let our colored neighbors fall into economic depression.‚Äù It was also evident that the level of business on Black Wall Street was insignificant in comparison to the Duke Tobacco industry. Therefore, the Dukes saw the aid to Black Wall Street as no threat to their industrial dominance of Durham. =Tension with white middle and working classes= Though racial tolerance and direct capital investment were prevalent amongst the highest ranking whites of Durham, the typical white citizen exhibited the stereotypical distaste for African Americans and provided little help in the progression of Black Wall Street. Labor working whites saw the increased employment of black workers as a threat to their own job security. The Dukes tripled black employment in their tobacco factories during the turn of the century, which angered a number of white workers who occasionally were even seen protesting against this increase in black employment. Though both Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. DuBois said that Durham‚Äôs white population was highly tolerant, this was not always the case. Envious of the rapid economic development, lower class whites occasionally attacked stores on Black Wall Street. The most famous of these attacks was cited on March 2, 1902 when a group of whites burned down an office owned by North Carolina Mutual. Blacks in southern communities including Durham did not see independent business as a solution to rising in the ranks of the social hierarchy. However a few blacks in Durham took the route of free enterprise instead of manual labor. This deterministic attitude was partially due to the strong leadership of the community under John Merrick. He once addressed the Hayti region, ‚ÄúI do think we [black community] have done well and I think we could have done better. Now let us make better use of the years we have left, as we have the past to look back over and see mistakes.‚Äù The positivity in terms of leadership allowed Black Wall Street to surpass most expectations. =Mechanics and Farmers Bank= Few options were available for blacks to safely place money deposits and earn interest, considering whites often barred blacks from using their banks. Taking the initiative to solve this predicament, the founders of M&F; Bank, Richard Fitzgerald and James Shepard, established the first African American bank. M&F; Bank grew to be more than simply a depository for African American wealth, but became a major source of loans for blacks. M&F; allowed Black Wall Street to become self-reliant in terms of funding and allowed for a direct increase in the number of institutions and organizations. Within twenty years of the bank‚Äôs founding in 1907, the number of black owned businesses in Durham tripled and the bank itself has been a profitable institution every year since its opening, even during the depressions. Economic growth The area saw a steady increase of population, wealth, and diversity of occupation. By 1890 the number of colored people in Durham was 1,858 or 33.8% of the total population. The year 1910 exhibited an increase of over 200% in the total population and the African American population was approximately 38% of the total. It is clear that whites were not impeding the development of this population, in light of their own endeavors. The numbers based on wealth were even more staggering. The total valuation of black property in the county was $8,696 in 1890. By 1920, this valuation skyrocketed to an astounding $4,298,067. Even after accounting for inflation, the level of growth for Black Wall Street was incredible. Booker T. Washington, mentioned in his commentary of Durham the level of vocational diversity. He wrote that he had ‚Äúnever seen in a city of this size so many prosperous blacksmiths, wheelwrights, cotton mill operatives, and tobacco factory owners among the Negros.‚Äù It is important to acknowledge the fact that these aforementioned statistics reflect gross numbers, and realistically much of the wealth was shared among a select few black business elite, not the entire population. Most blacks in Durham, due to financial limitations, were still working in the Duke Tobacco factories or as agricultural laborers after emancipation. The few that were able to enter business had personal connections such as in the case of Merrick. Even within the business owners‚Äô sector of the black population, few reached the economic status of Merrick, Spaulding, or Fitzgerald. A majority of African American business owners realistically operated small stores specialized in certain goods that frequently did not result in huge successes. In an official business census in 1905, it was estimated that over 75% of revenue from Black Wall Street came from North Carolina Mutual and M&F; Bank. Therefore, Durham represented a unique setting for its select few black business owners, but this was not the case for the average African American. Social strata Black Wall Street had a considerable effect on social progression. During the late 1800s the first Jim Crow laws were established, which mandated racial segregation in all public facilities in Southern United States. By 1890 the ‚Äúseparate but equal‚Äù clause had become quite common throughout the south. Black Wall Street indirectly maintained this concept. Black social strata in Durham was shifting rapidly during the late 1800s. The self-made African American businessman yielded high status and ‚Äúsuffered little condescension‚Äù from the older, white oriented business class. By the start of the 1900s increasing segregation and urbanization encouraged the rise of a black business class. This threatened to reorder the African American status system that had been determined by antebellum forces. Fortunately for Durham, the lack of an entrenched antebellum social order, allowed this social change to come about with little upheaval. Higher ranking blacks like Merrick were considered upper class and ‚Äúnew rich.‚Äù However, as previously mentioned this social change did not involve the desegregation of whites and blacks. Instead two distinct social structures were apparent due to the presence of Black Wall Street. The presence of an expanding urban area that offered industrial opportunity allowed for the formation of a black middle class. The only true interaction that occurred between the two distinct social hierarchies occurred at the highest ranks, such as in the case of Merrick with the Dukes and Julian Carr. Legacy By the end of World War II, the success of African American businesses gave Durham the title as ‚ÄúCapital of the Black Middle Class.‚Äù However, the 1960s urban renewal removed much of Hayti and Durham‚Äôs Black Wall Street. This urban sprawl coupled with a heated Civil Rights movements from the 1940s to 1970s began the first real desegregation of black and white business districts. By the late 1900s the Census Bureau reported the city‚Äôs population as 39.8% black and 59.8% white. North Carolina Mutual remained the largest and oldest African American life insurance company. The legacy of these original businesses is still prevalent in current Durham institutions. Durham‚Äôs downtown, once neglected for sprawl, is quickly becoming the city‚Äôs most popular destination. Today, historic Parrish Street, is at the center of downtown revitalization. The Parrish Street Project was recently formed as an initiative of the City of Durham to honor the history of Black Wall Street and spur economic revitalization along a central downtown corridor.

The 2014 budget was the first delivered by the Abbott Government, since the Coalition's victory in the 2013 Australian federal election. Treasurer Joe Hockey presented the budget to the House of Representatives on 13 May 2014.BUDGET SPEECH 2014‚Äë15 The budget featured significant changes to address a perceived deficit crisis. This included a proposed dramatic downsizing of government bureaucracy, and contained significant changes to welfare, new initiatives for a medical research fund and spending on roads. A budget surplus exceeding 1% of GDP was not expected until 2023. The austere budget faced widespread criticism and was overwhelmingly rejected by the Australian public as reflected in all opinion polls after its release. Opposition to \\"unfair\\" budget measures came from the opposition and cross-bench, pensioners, economists, the union movement, students and welfare, community and disability groups with some taking to the streets in protest. The budget included changes which were contrary to pre- election commitments and promises made by the Liberals in opposition. Critics argue that every one of the following pre-election commitments made by Tony Abbott were broken in the first budget: \\"No cuts to education, no cuts to health, no change to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS.\\"Tony Abbott promises no cuts to education, health and other areas on the eve of the 2013 federal election: ABC 12 August 2014 Echos of the \\"dead and buried\\" Fightback! policy package from the 1993 election occurred with proposals to defer unemployment benefits for six months for under 30s and the removal of GP bulk billing. Most proposals have since been shelved, dumped or modified. National Commission of Audit The Abbott Government commissioned a National Commission of Audit in October 2013 to recommend measures to reduce government spending. The Commission made 86 recommendations, including a slowing of increases in the age pension, an increase in the retirement age to 70 by 2035 and the inclusion of the family home in new means testing from 2027. These Commission's recommendations were adopted in the budget.ABC news Other controversial recommendations include copayments of Medicare bulk billing, besides other. Forecasts Before the budget's release Treasurer Joe Hockey signalled the budget would contain widespread spending cuts in response to what he described as an unsustainable growth in government expenditure. =Deficit = In August 2013, in a budget update before the forthcoming federal election, the Australian Treasurer under the Second Rudd Government forecast a $30.1 billion deficit for 2013/14. In December 2013, the Australian Treasurer under the Abbott Government forecast a $47 billion deficit for the same period, due to the new government's decision not to implement savings and revenue measures put forward by the Rudd Government before the election, and an unexpected injection of $8 billion into the Reserve Bank. The four-year forward estimates project a difference of $68 billion. More than half of that difference has been attributed to lower government revenue from taxation. A surplus was projected for 2023/24. The budget forecast a deficit for 2014/15 of $29.8 billion. Revenue =Taxation= The budget introduced a \\"deficit levy\\" of 2% on personal incomes over $180,000, which was expected to raise around $2.5 billion a year over its duration. Legislation to impose the levy, called the Temporary Budget Repair Levy, was assented to on 25 June 2014, and commenced on 1 July 2014 and will apply for three years.ATO: Temporary Budget Repair Levy The corporate tax rate will decrease by 1.5% from 1 July 2015 to 28.5%. The National Commission of Audit recommended that the Family Tax Benefit Part B be abolished. It will now be means tested to a new threshold of $100,000. Families will cease being eligible for the payment when their youngest child turns six. The indexation of the federal fuel excise was reintroduced. The adjustment will be made twice a year and is expected to raise $3.7 billion in its first four years. Indexation had been abandoned in 2001. The change took effect on 10 November 2014, increasing the base rate to 38.6 from 38.14¬¢ per litre. Expenditure In April 2014, Joe Hockey made it clear the budget would see a significant tightening of federal government expenditure which would be felt by all sectors of the community. More than three-quarters of the savings in the 2014 budget were the result of cuts to government spending. =General government= A number of federal government services and approvals will increase in price and new fees will apply including some provided by Austrade and Geoscience Australia. Funding for foreign aid is being frozen leading to a saving of $7.6 billion over five years. Federal politicians and public servants will have their salary frozen for one year. Post retirement benefits for federal politicians are being reigned in. This includes limitations on travel expenses, staffing arrangements and working entitlements. 3,000 positions within the Australian Tax Office will be lost with thousands of staff retrenched from other major federal departments. The Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency and the Australian Water Commission are to be abolished. 76 government agencies will be abolished a small number merged or privatised. These cutbacks are expected to save $500 million over four years. The budget for the CSIRO was reduced by $146.8 million over four years. =Social security and welfare= The Newstart Allowance for those seeking work will not be available to people under the age of 25. The unemployed under the age of 30 would not qualify for any payment for six months, after which the Work for the Dole program would be required. If after another six months there is no employment, the six-month cycle of off/on payment starts again. The Schoolkids bonus is to be abolished. A Paid Parental Leave scheme is being introduced. The Seniors Health Card will not be eligible to retired couples with more than $1.4 million in assets. The indexation for pensions will be lowered from 2017 onwards, after it is linked to inflation rather than male average earnings. New funding for the National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS) ceased on 1 July 2014 with funding for tenanted NRAS properties continuing. The First Home Saver Accounts scheme will be abolished leading to savings of $134.3 million. Documents revealed in 2018 showed that the government was considering a social security measure for this budget which would cut off income support entirely for people under 30. =Infrastructure, transport and energy= The budget allocated significant funding for road infrastructure in western Sydney, including for the WestConnex motorway and for roads to Badgerys Creek Airport as well as significant funding for Melbourne's East West Link. There was also funding for two major road projects in South East Queensland ‚Äì the final section of the upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway and the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing The budget reduced government support for renewable energy and climate change-related programs. =Education= The budget proposed to cut $4.7 billion of funding from higher education over four years. On average, the Commonwealth's contribution to the funding of university degrees was to be cut by 20%. From 2016, the interest rate charged on HECS debts, which had been linked to the consumer price index was to be charged at the same rate as government long-term borrowings. HECS debts would have to be repaid once an individual's income reaches $50,638. Universities were to be able to set their own fees for courses under a new deregulated fee system. Modelling conducted by Universities Australia indicates that the fee to study at an Australian university will on average double in cost. $245.3 million was to be spent on continuing the school chaplaincy program over four years. =Defence= Before the budget was released the Abbott Government announced Australia's biggest ever military purchase of 58 Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II which are to be delivered in 2018. =Health= A controversial $7 co-payment to see a bulk billing doctor, receive x-rays and get a blood test was proposed to save $3.4 billion over five years, however $5 of it will go toward medical research. All 61 Medicare Locals‚Äîorganisations established to plan and fund extra health services‚Äîare going to close. The Senate blocked passage of the medical co-payment, but approved the establishment of the Medical Research Future Fund in August 2015, with funding to be found through reduced health spending and the Health and Hospitals Fund, until a balance of $20bn is reached in 2020.Medical Research Future Fund finally gets Senate approval; The Australian; 13 August 2015 =Community services and culture= Funding for the ABC and SBS is being cut by 1% leading to costs savings of $43.5 million. This is despite repeated comments by the Abbott Government that funding to the ABC would not be cut, which Abbott later said he regretted. The ABC's contract to operate the Australia Network was cancelled after its first year of a 10-year contract. The Australia Council for the Arts had its funding cut by around $30 million. Screen Australia is losing $38 million over four years. More than 150 programs, grants and activities designed to assist Indigenous Australians are being replaced by five broad-based programs with cuts to funding of $534 million aimed at reducing duplication and waste. The next three years of funding to the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples has been cancelled. Money was allocated to a school truancy officer program, extra police in remote communities and Indigenous teenage sexual health programs. Rural communities are expected to benefit from the introduction of the Green Army. The Green Army aims to provide training and experience in the environmental and heritage conservation fields for the unemployed aged 17‚Äì24 years. Funding for community Landcare grants has been reduced and replaced by the establishment of the National Landcare Program. =Science= Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is to see its budget cut by $AU114 million, forcing the closure of two historic radio telescopes. Opposition and crossbench response Opposition leader Bill Shorten has expressed fierce opposition to the doctor co-payments, changes to the pension age and unemployment benefits as well as cuts to state funding and the fuel excise. Both the ALP and the Australian Greens opposed the move to a deregulated fee structure for university degrees on the basis that the quality of education will likely shift towards a person's capacity to pay. Jenny Macklin criticised changes to welfare for the unemployed saying that \\"The Prime Minister has completely deserted young Australians looking for work\\". Clive Palmer dismissed the government's stated concern over sovereign debt claiming the budget was \\"based on lies\\". Senator Nick Xenophon described the budget as \\"mean, nasty and dumb\\". Independent MP Andrew Wilkie implored the opposition and crossbench MPs to go so far as to block supply in his opposition to the budget. Following the second rejection of the budget measures by the Senate, Abbott has been challenged by Opposition Leader Bill Shorten and Clive Palmer to act upon a double dissolution trigger and request Governor-General Peter Cosgrove to dissolve both houses of Parliament or bring in a mini-budget. Critical reception Protestors at 18 May 2014 anti-budget march in Melbourne.Zielinski, Caroline: \\"10,000 gather in the CBD to protest budget cuts\\", in The Age, 19 May 2014 Even before the budget was delivered the Reserve Bank of Australia warned that a tightening of fiscal policy combined with a decline in resources construction projects would lead to an increase in the unemployment rate. Economist Ben Phillips described the budget as \\"very regressive overall\\". Economist Chris Richardson described the budget as the toughest since 1997. Welfare, community and disability groups rallied heavily against the budget.Fair go gone with welfare budget cuts: SBS 13 May 2014 It was criticised because it places a higher burden on low income earners compared to the more wealthy. Analysis by ACOSS revealed the budget will hit low and middle-income households the hardest. Further analysis by the Treasury indicated that the budget would have disproportionately negative impact on low income households compared to wealthier ones. Chief Executive of the Council on the Ageing Ian Yates criticised changes to pension index arrangements claiming they would result in more pensioners falling below the poverty line. ACOSS was also highly critical of the cessation of payments for the first six months to unemployed people under 30. David Gonski criticised plans to limit school funding to CPI increases rather than a needs based funding model after 2017. The Australian Education Union criticised funding for chaplains in school saying the money could be spent on students with disabilities. One of the strongest criticisms of the budget is that it breaks numerous pre-election promises. In response to a loss in funding for hospitals and schools, premiers and chief ministers attended an emergency meeting in Sydney to discuss their response. Post-budget polls revealed a large decline in support for the government, with the opposition opening up various leads on the primary and two-party vote, better prime minister, and net satisfaction ratings.

She was born in Chatham, Kent. She was never married; \\"Mrs\\" was an honorific given to nannies and cooks as a courtesy. One of her early jobs was for the family of Thompson Phillips, a clergyman in Cumberland, where she brought up Ella Phillips for 12 years. She went into service with the Churchill family at the beginning of 1875, a month after Winston's birth. Later she was responsible for his younger brother Jack as well. Lord Randolph Churchill and Jennie Jerome Churchill were very active in society but emotionally distant, even neglectful, of their son. Young Winston became very close with his nanny and addressed her as \\"Woom,\\" the nearest he could get to saying \\"Woman.\\" Churchill wrote in his autobiography, My Early Life : \\"I loved my mother dearly - but at a distance. My nurse was my confidante. Mrs Everest it was who looked after me and tended all my wants. It was to her I poured out all my many troubles.\\" She remained with the family until 1893, when she was let go. Churchill biographer William Manchester wrote that her firing was handled abruptly and poorly, given her long and devoted service to the family. She then returned to the Thomson Phillips family - he was by then an archdeacon in Barrow-in-Furness - and lived there for about a year. Her final home was with her sister, 15 Crouch Hill in Finsbury Park, North London. Everest died there of peritonitis on 3 July 1895. Churchill telegraphed the Venerable Thompson Phillips, and the two men attended the funeral service together (although her other charge, Ella, did not). Churchill wrote, \\"[Phillips] had a long memory for faithful service.\\" Churchill paid for Everest's headstone in the City of London Cemetery and Crematorium, Newham, Greater London. His son, Randolph, wrote, \\"For many years afterwards he paid an annual sum to the local florist for the upkeep of the grave.\\" Inspection of the headstone shows the wording ‚Äúby Winston Spencer Churchill‚Äù at the base with \\"Jack Spencer Churchill\\" reported to be below that wording.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6380566/elizabeth-ann-everest References  Other articles  * Churchill by Roy Jenkins * The Last Lion: Winston Spencer Churchill by William Manchester * Young Winston, a film featuring Churchill and Mrs. Everest 1830s births 1895 deaths Nannies Deaths from peritonitis People from Chatham, Kent Winston Churchill English domestic workers ","title":"Elizabeth Everest"},{"id":"42512706","text":"Michael Webster is a Canadian clinical psychologist and former Canadian Football League player for the Montreal Alouettes and BC Lions, and Grey Cup champion.

Function The sperm- specific protein Izumo, named for a Japanese shrine dedicated to marriage, is essential for sperm-egg plasma membrane binding and fusion.

The Miss World beauty pageant, which was controversial in Nigeria, was relocated to London after bloody clashes between Muslims and Christians, caused by what some Muslims deemed to be a \\"blasphemous\\" article in the Christian newspaper ThisDay about the event. The Miss World riots were part of the Sharia conflict in Nigeria, that started in 1999 when several predominantly Islamic states in Northern Nigeria decided to introduce Sharia law.  Background  Because the 2001 contest was won by the Nigerian Agbani Darego, Miss World 2002 would take place in (and be aired from) the Nigerian capital Abuja. In the run-up to the pageant there were many controversies, like the fact that it coincided with the Muslim holy month of ramadan, and the whole beauty contest was perceived by many conservative Muslims and also Christians to be unchaste. The organisation conceded to the first complaint by moving the event from the end of November to 7 December, but did not act on the second complaint. In several places, especially in the mostly Muslim North, peaceful protests were held against conducting Miss World in Nigeria. Feminists argued the pageant was too sexist because it merely considered women's beauty and paid no attention to intelligence and character; the organisation conceded to them by altering the swimsuit parade to a photo shoot. However, conservative Islamic groups turned even more strongly against the Miss World organisation when it took a stand in the case of the Nigerian woman Amina Lawal. Amina had been condemned to death by stoning by a regional Islamic court because of alleged adultery. First, Miss C√¥te d'Ivoire Yannick Az√©bian and Miss Norway Kathrine S√∏rland indicated at the end of August 2002 that they would boycott the beauty contest; other Misses expressed their doubts as well. Miss Belgium, Denmark, France and Spain too decided to stay away, Miss Holland ignored calls to do so; the chairman of the Miss Holland opined: \\"Then you are actually giving the people in the North what they want. They are stopping an event which is 'perverse' in their eyes and are just continuing their ridiculous legislation.\\" Other Misses also found that exactly by showing up in Abuja they could make a statement against conservative beliefs about women. Civil rights activists eventually were able to persuade the Miss World organisation as a whole to plead for the release of Amina Lawal to the Nigerian federal authorities, eventually convincing them to promise that the stoning would not be permitted.  Riots  After this, a column appeared in the Lagos-based Christian newspaper ThisDay on Saturday 16 November,Full original ThisDay column: in which journalist Isioma Daniel wrote that the Islamic prophet Muhammad would probably have approved of the Miss World competition: 'The Muslims thought it was immoral to bring ninety- two women to Nigeria and ask them to revel in vanity. What would Mohammed think? In all honesty, he would probably have chosen a wife from one of them.' This sparked outrage among some Muslims, and from 20 till 23 November the city of Kaduna was the stage of bloody riots between Muslims and Christians.Human Rights Watch, \\"Leave Everything to God\\", p. 9. Two years earlier, Kaduna had already seen violent Christian-Muslim clashes. Many inhabitants had a strong sense of injustice because none of the perpetrators had been prosecuted afterwards. Moreover, the riots had caused Christians and Muslims to concentrate and isolate themselves in separate districts. The ThisDay incident caused latent tensions in the religiously-divided city to erupt. *Already in the evening of 16 November, prominent Muslims angrily spread the message via fax and SMS. The Lagos office of ThisDay was inundated with telephone calls from furious Muslims; the editor told Daniel that she was to blame, and on Monday 18 November she was stripped of all her responsibilities. *On Tuesday 19 November, the newspaper published a retraction on its front page and apologised, but to no avail. *On Wednesday morning of 20 November, the ThisDay office in Kaduna was sacked and burned to the ground by \\"four busloads\\" of Muslim fanatics, while another group raided the offices of other newspapers elsewhere, picking out the copies of ThisDay and lighting them in public, according to an employee of the local opinion magazine Weekly Trust, who suspected an organisation to be behind the attacks. The local office chief of ThisDay went in hiding. Also churches were assaulted by Muslims. Daniel immediately quit her job at ThisDay when she heard about it, and stayed at home in the midst of death threats and worried colleagues, relatives and friends. *On Thursday 21 November, armed rioters attacked shouting Allahu akbar! (\\"God is great\\") and No Tazarene! (\\"No beauty contest\\") and killing Christians, storming and looting Christian houses, companies and churches and burning them down. Groups of Muslim youths built barricades with burning car tyres, passers-by in Christian neighbourhoods were attacked by them, drivers were pulled out of their vehicles and murdered on the spot with machetes and axes. Eyewitnesses reported that the attackers were between the ages of 12 and 26, armed with machetes, cutlasses, butcher's knives, sticks and guns, their faces painted unrecognisably with charcoal; they appeared not to be from the neighbourhood. Many local Hausa Muslims let Christians hide in their homes, or claimed that a Christian house belonged to them to prevent the attackers from lighting it on fire; there were however also some who told the attackers where the Christians lived. The attackers also slaughtered two Muslims students (who fiercely denied being Christians) by accident because they wore T-shirts rather than traditional Islamic clothing. The riot police did little to nothing to stop the riots. That day, 50 people were killed and 300 wounded according to early estimates. Additionally, there were many burnt out cars and destroyed buildings. The Sultan of Sokoto called for calm and peace on national television, but the federal Minister for Abuja burst into tears in front of the cameras, crying that Daniel has blasphemed the prophet. *On Friday 22 November, Christian groups took revenge and killed Muslims and set fire to Muslim homes, companies and mosques. At a road block, Christians in their twenties were stopping traffic. They asked people to recite John 3:16\\"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\\" (NIV) to check who were Christians; Muslims were murdered. Christians from surrounding villages joined the counter-attacks against Muslim districts, several Muslims were killed and burned in the streets. A group of 500 Christian youths tried to assault a Muslim neighbourhood, but they were stopped by the military. The Christian vengeances led to new reprisals by Muslims after the Friday prayer. In the afternoon, the riots spread to Abuja, where Muslim youths set fire to cars. The police were quick to respond however, and there were no deaths. The Miss World organisation, that had already been preparing the event in Abuja for three weeks, decided in the evening of 22 November to move it to London instead, because fears had arisen for the safety of the participants, who themselves had indicated they would rather stay, even after hearing about the tens of manslaughters, to not give in to the pressure of the fundamentalists. Daniel fled to neighbouring Benin. *On Saturday 23 November, the clashes were finally quelled by security forces, who also killed tens of people in the process of restoring order. On 26 November, Islamic clerics from Zamfara State issued a fatwa against the journalist Isioma Daniel for insulting the prophet. The fatwa constituted a death sentence, and all Muslims worldwide were called on to murder her. In a statement that was later broadcast on local radio, the deputy governor Mamuda Aliyu Shinkafi of Zamfara declared: \\"Like Salman Rushdie, the blood of Isioma Daniel can be shed. It is binding on all Muslims wherever they are to consider the killing of the writer as a religious duty.\\" The federal government of Nigeria rejected the fatwa, and it was declared null and void by the relevant Saudi Arabian authorities.  Aftermath  The Kaduna riots claimed the lives of about 250 people, mostly men and boys; 20,000 to 30,000 people lost their homes. More than 1,000 people were arrested on suspicion of inciting or partaking in the violence. The Committee to Protect Journalists and Amnesty International eventually helped Daniel to go in exile in Europe, because it was too dangerous for her to return to Nigeria. Among those killed were the parents of Nigerian footballer and international, Victor Moses, who fled the country as a result. Amina Lawal, who was very thankful to the Misses for their concern about her fate, but who had spoken out against a boycott (just before the riots broke out), was eventually acquitted on 25 September 2003. Upon the pageant's return to England, many of the boycotting contestants chose to attend, including Miss Norway, Kathrine S√∏rland, who was ironically tipped in the last few days as the number one favourite for the crown she had previously boycotted.Telegraph.co.uk ‚Äì Don't boycott Nigeria's Miss World contest, begs mother facing stoningTelegraph.co.uk ‚Äì Contestants threaten Miss World boycott over stoning The competition was eventually won by the Turkish Azra Akin; she was the second and at present last Miss World from a Muslim-majority country (the first being the Egyptian Antigone Costanda in 1954).

History  = First Formation = The division was formed at Balashov in the Volga Military District in July 1940, under the command of Kombrig Vasily Rakovsky. Just before the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the June 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union, the division became part of the 63rd Rifle Corps. After the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the division and its corps were sent to the front, joining the 21st Army of the Reserve of the High Command (Stavka reserve). From 28 June, the 167th fought in defense of positions between Rogachev and Zhlobin. During the Battle of Smolensk the division repulsed German attempts to cross the Dnieper. Launching a counterattack, it advanced to the line of the Drut River and remained there until 12 August, when it was withdrawn to the army reserve. Relocated to the area of Dovsk, the division defended the latter as part of the 67th Rifle Corps, fighting in encirclement from 13 August. Due to its loss of contact with the 67th Rifle Corps, the 167th returned to the control of the 63rd Rifle Corps from 14 August. In the encirclement, Rakovsky decided to destroy heavy weapons and ordered the division to escape in groups. He led a group of 25 others out of the encirclement with their weapons in the sector of the 155th Rifle Division of the Bryansk Front on 18 September; about 2,500 men of the division escaped the encirclement. The units that escaped encirclement were disbanded and their men used to reinforce other units. = Second Formation = On 16 December 1941, the 438th Rifle Division was formed in the Ural Military District. On 23 January 1942, it became the 167th Rifle Division (Second Formation). The division was recreated at Ssucho Lug in February 1942 and fought near Bryansk and at Kursk. The division fought in the Battle of the Dnieper. Division personnel Major Fyodor Bruy, Junior lieutenant Alexander Bondarev, Sergeant major Arkady Chepelev, Senior sergeant Alexey Gabrusev, Sergeant Andrian Zhuravlev and Private Dmitry Yemelyanov, among others, were awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union for their actions during the battle.warheroes.ru The division fought in the Carpathians and in Hungary. The division was with the 1st Guards Army of the 4th Ukrainian Front in May 1945. The division ended the war with the honorifics \\"Sumy-Kiev Twice Red Banner\\". Postwar, the division moved to Chortkov with the 107th Rifle Corps, part of the 38th Army in the Carpathian Military District. The division and its corps were disbanded in May 1946.

An AXE agent is murdered while investigating a Greek tourist agency, Golden Islands Promotions, which has been responsible for sponsoring large numbers of US visa applications. AXE chief, David Hawk, sends Nick Carter to Greece to investigate further. Posing as archaeologist, Prof Andrew Harding, Carter establishes contact with Golden Islands Promotion. Then posing as a merchant seaman, Thomas Evans, Carter contacts Leonidas, an old World War II Greek resistance fighter. Carter learns that Golden Islands Promotions has a training camp on the island of Baos in the Cyclades. Carter is followed and attacked by members of the Sons of Prometheus ‚Äì a secret terrorist organization ‚Äì who think ‚ÄúEvans‚Äù is spying on them. Carter (as Prof. Harding) attends a function organized by Golden Islands Promotions where American guests are introduced to young men and women seeking sponsors for their visa applications to the US. Carter discovers that many of the candidates have close relatives in communist countries. As part of their training, the candidates are compelled to take various technical courses. Carter suspects that they are unwittingly being taught the tradecraft of espionage and will be coerced into spying against the US later by threats made against their families. Carter meets Princess Electra ‚Äì girlfriend of Papadorus ‚Äì the billionaire owner of Golden Islands Promotions. She suspects Carter is investigating the activities of Golden Islands and sends thugs to murder him at his hotel. Carter kills the thugs and makes his way to the training camp on Baos assisted by Leonidas. With Leonidas, Carter confirms the camp has been established to train spies and discovers a large cache of weapons and military vehicles. Carter and Leonidas destroy the camp, the arms depots and the island's dock. Carter and Leonidas are hunted down and trapped in mountain caves. Leonidas is killed and Carter is captured. He is interrogated by Ian McAffery ‚Äì a British mercenary ‚Äì hired by Papadorus. McAffery is ordered to bring Carter by seaplane to Papadorus' yacht sailing in the Aegean. Carter kills McAffery whilst in flight using Pierre his poison gas pellet and assumes McAffery's identity. Carter (disguised as McAffery) attends a meeting with Papadorus, General Lin and Gorgas. Papadorus' shipping line is bankrupt and is currently bankrolled by the Chinese government as an efficient means of moving Chinese spies around the world. Gorgas and the Sons of Prometheus are also bankrolled by the Chinese and are planning a coup d'etat to topple the Greek government. Despite losing much of their arms and supplies in the Baos raid Gorgas demands to launch his coup in the morning ‚Äì starting with the destruction of the Parthenon. Gorgas leaves the meeting. Papadorus and General Lin grow weary of Gorgas' demands and intend to have him assassinated. Carter is unmasked as an AXE agent when General Lin exposes Carter's distinctive tattoo. Held captive in a cellar, Carter overhears how Papadorus and Princess Electra will escape from Lin's hold over them. They will kidnap rich patrons attending a play given by the Golden Islands Promotions recruits imprison them on Papadorus' yacht and ransom them off to their families to obtain enough funds to live comfortably in South America. Carter is taken to a nearby Temple of Poseidon on the coast where he is tied to a pole in a rock pool to be drowned when the tide comes in. As he waits he is attacked by a giant octopus. Carter kills the octopus by biting its head. He escapes and makes his way to the Theater of Sophocles ‚Äì an ancient amphitheatre carved into the hillside outside Athens where the play is to be performed. Posing as a member of the Greek chorus, Carter foils the kidnap attempt and chases Princess Electra into the nearby countryside. He kills her and her body falls off the cliff into the sea. Carter and Shorty (an ally from Interpol) go to the docks in Piraeus and find Papadorus' yacht almost ready to sail. Shorty watches the ship while Carter goes to the Parthenon ‚Äì expecting Gorgas to keep his promise to blow it up. Gorgas has rigged the Parthenon with plastic explosive and has tied Carter's girlfriend, Xenia, to one of the temple‚Äôs columns. Carter kills Gorgas and rescues Xenia. Papadorus and General Lin do not wait for Princess Electra to return with the hostages and set sail for Albania. Carter, Shorty, Xenia and a US sailor give chase in an experimental US navy hydrofoil. They are fired upon and Shorty is killed. Carter destroys the yacht with depth charge. There are no survivors from the yacht. Carter returns to Piraeus and goes on a sailing vacation with Xenia.

He is best known for the book On the Conditions and Possibilities of Helen Clark Taking Me as Her Young Lover and the theatrical adaptations of his work.Coleman, Ewan (2012) \\"Good but only in parts\\" Dominion Post, 5 October First published in 2005, On the Conditions and Possibilities of Helen Clark Taking Me as Her Young Lover, received favourable reviews in New ZealandSomerset, Guy (2005) \\"Review\\" Dominion Post, August and international press. The book, often shortened to OTC&POHCTMAHYL;, asked why Helen Clark, the Prime Minister at the time would want a young lover and then why the young lover would be Meros. The book is a work of metafiction as it concludes that the greatest likelihood of Meros being taken as a young lover would be if he wrote a book on the conditions and possibilities of being taken as a young lover. The Guardian described it as 'decidedly lascivious' and the NZ Listener called it a 'mock philosophical treatise' before praising it as 'the underground publishing hit of the decade'. The book was reissued and adapted into a play of the same name in 2007,Laurie Atkinson (2008) Slick, wicked poke at politics, Dominion Post(reprint in Theatreview.co.nz), 17 January touring nationally and was nominated for theatrical performance of the year. For his role as Meros, Arthur Meek was awarded the most promising male newcomer of 2008 at the Chapman Tripp Awards. In 2015, the book was once again adapted into a play that substitutes Hillary Clinton for Helen Clark. In 2007 Stephens released Richard Meros salutes the Southern Man, a pastoral account of the cultural persona of a male from the south of New Zealand's South Island. This was adapted by the same team that made on the conditions and possibilities of Helen Clark taking me as her Young Lover and toured to positive reviews winning best touring production at the Dunedin Theatre Awards. The book was reissued for the theatrical tour with an introduction by Duncan Sarkies. In 2008, Stephens released Beggars and Choosers: The Complete Written Correspondence Between Creative New Zealand and Richard Meros volume one which was followed with a second volume titled $30 Meat Pack in 2012.Matthews, Phillip (2013) 'Pair of Cryptic Private Jokes' Dominion Post 2 February When Privatising Parts was released in 2011, it was viewed by New Zealand media as a follow up to on the conditions and possibilities of Helen Clark taking me as her Young Lover. This book argued that if the new Prime Minister John Key did not want to lose office he would have to learn the lesson that Helen Clark did not. Meros argues that it was not his reasoning that was ineffective in the first book, but that love, itself was inefficient. He proposed that the government first nationalise love through a State Owned Enterprise and secondly privatise it.Burgess, Malcolm (2011) 'Small and Cheekily Formed' Dominion Post, 11 May. This book toured New Zealand and Australia in 2012 and 2013, through a new collaboration with Heleyni Pratley (actor/screenwriter) and Eleanor Bishop (director). Stephens has released five other books under the Meros pseudonym since 2014 through Lawrence & Gibson in New Zealand, including novels and a textbook, though none have achieved the success of On the conditions and possibilities of Helen Clark taking me as her Young Lover. He has also written for a wide range of publications in New Zealand from current affairs magazine NZ Listener and daily newspaper the Dominion Post to arts publications White Fungus and Letting Space, literary magazine Hue & Cry, and for the group Political Organisation Aotearoa. In 2015, Meros was a recipient of Eleanor Catton's Horoeka Grant. In response he wrote the essay 'New Bourgeoizealand'http://horoekareading.com/new-bourgeoizealand-by-richard- meros/ on a politics of lack and abundance in New Zealand. Pseudonym Meros is a pseudonym used by Murdoch Stephens, as well as appearing as a character in another of his novels, released under the name Nestor Notabilis.

As Guderian's 2nd Panzer group started its wheel from Smolensk to the south on 8 August, 2nd Army, on its right flank, was slow to join in because of poor weather, ammunition shortages, and the hesitancy of General Weichs, its Army commander.Glantz, David M.

On 12 August the 2nd Army finally launched its attack south-east of Bobrusk. It broke through the defenses of the Soviet 21st Army, and in three days fighting, encircled the bulk of the soviet 63rd Rifle corps, in a pocket at Zhlobin. Lacking in mobile units, the 112th division, still part of XII Army Corps, formed the eastern pincer of the attack; breaking through successive defensive lines and eventually linking up with 267th Infantry division coming from the other way, near the village of Ljuschowskaja and the Saltanovka railway station, on the Zhlobin - Gomel rail line. Stretching a thin barrier across the Soviet Corps escape route, the 112th Division spent the next 3 days fending off repeated, and increasingly desperate escape attempts. By 20 August General Feldt‚Äôs 1st Cavalry Division had captured Gormel, and 2nd army tallied its accomplishments, totalling 78,000 prisoners, 700 guns, and 144 tanks; many of these from the Shobin pocket. The Soviet machine gunner covers attacking infantry near Tula, in November 1941 By the tail end of October the encirclement battles around Briansk were over, the 112th crossed the Oka river south of Belev, inching its way forward slowly through the mud.

The long eastern flank of 2 panzer group was a problem, and Generaloberst Guderian shifted the 112th division as part of the LIII corps to his right to shore up the protection thereW.V. Madeja, Russo-German War, Autumn 1941, p35-39 The division, redeploying to the region south of Tula, met forces from the Soviet 13th Army near Teploye, who were attempting to drive on Tula from the east and disrupt the German armoured thrust towards Moscow. The Soviets using the superior mobility of their cavalry units, delayed the LIII corps mission so much that Guderian had to reinforce it with tanks, artillery and flak, a move which slowed the whole advance of the Panzer Grupe. With the aid of the reinforcements, the 112th infantry division drove the 13th Army forces off to the east and advanced towards Stalinogorsk. Here it was attacked by newly arrived Siberian 239th Rifle Division, supported by tanks, suffered a severe reverse, and showed 'signs of panic'. General Heinz Guderian, Panzer leader, p248 Unprepared for the winter conditions, each infantry regiment had already lost 500 men to frostbite, and in the severe cold, machine guns often failed to fire. The division was now very weak and unable to advance further. On 2 November 1942 the division was disbanded. The remaining infantry were amalgamated and formed into the 112 divisional group (a regimental equivalent) and along with support elements from the division were used to build Corps Detachment B.

His top accomplishments include six consecutive gold medals in the International Olympiad in Informatics as well as the world championship in the 2013 and 2015 International Collegiate Programming Contest World Finals. As of December 2018, Gennady is the highest-rated programmer at CodeChef, Topcoder, AtCoder and HackerRank.  Biography Korotkevich was born in Gomel (Homiel), southeastern Belarus. His parents, Vladimir and Lyudmila Korotkevich, are programmers in the mathematics department at Francysk Skaryna Homiel State University. At age 6, he became interested in his parents' work. When he was 8, his father designed a children's game he could use to learn programming. His mother consulted departmental colleague Mikhail Dolinsky, who gave Korotkevich a small book to read. Dolinsky, one of the top computer science teachers in Belarus, recalled, \\"A month went by, and then another one ... No news from Gena. Then suddenly Lyudmila comes by and brings me a programming notebook: when summer and football were over, her son sat at the computer. As a second-grader at a national competition, he took second place, which gained him an automatic entry into a technical university without taking any entrance exams. Somehow he solved the problem of a body immersed in water. At that time, Gena didn't even know about Archimedes' principle of buoyancy.\\" Korotkevich first gained global attention when he qualified for the 2006 International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) at the age of 11, a world record by a large margin. He took the silver medal at his first IOI event and received gold medals from 2007 to 2012. To date, he is the most successful competitor in IOI's history. At the 2009 IOI in Plovdiv, the then 14-year-old Korotkevich said of his success, \\"I try various [strategies], and one of them is the right one. I am no genius. I am simply good at it.\\" He said he spent no more than three to four hours each day at the computer, and his preferred hobbies are football and table tennis. In the fall of 2012, he moved to Russia to attend ITMO University. In the summer of 2013, he helped ITMO defeat Shanghai Jiao Tong University and the University of Tokyo to win the 37th International Collegiate Programming Contest World Finals, held in St. Petersburg. He also won the annual Google Code Jam from 2014 to 2020. In a 2014 interview, Korotkevich said he was unsure of his career plans after graduation. \\"What happens next is yet to be decided,\\" he said. \\"I don't have any concrete or long-term plans. I've only finished my sophomore year at university. For me, it's important to get an education first and then decide about working. Maybe I'll go into science. But again, I really have not decided yet.\\" In a 2017 interview, Korotkevich said \\"I've gotten job offers from Google and Yandex several times, but didn't take them... I am getting a Masters in Computer Science at ITMO, afterward I think that's what I'll do. \\" In 2019, Korokevich was a PhD student at ITMO.

It includes several previously released songs re-recorded as acoustic versions, as well as six new acoustic tracks. Although the band released their critically acclaimed Southside Double-Wide: Acoustic Live in 2004, Time Travelers & Bonfires is their first acoustic studio album. The album sold around 15,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release to debut at position No. 19 on The Billboard 200 chart. Writing and production On November 22, 2013, Sevendust partnered with PledgeMusic for a direct-to-fan campaign to help fund the creation of 'Time Travelers & Bonfires' and was set to last 130 days. It is said they reached their goal over the course of the first weekend. Therefore, the band reconvened at Architekt Studios in Butler, New Jersey, where they recorded their ninth studio album, to work on six brand new songs which had been written and recorded for the acoustic album and re-recorded some of their previous released songs and fan-selected cuts from their catalog included \\"Black\\", \\"Gone\\", \\"Denial\\", \\"Karma\\", \\"Trust\\" and \\"Crucified\\" in the sounds of acoustics. Lead singer Lajon Witherspoon stated that the band decided to do an acoustic studio album after the strong positive reaction Southside Double-Wide received from their fanbase. Also Morgan Rose explained that the band looked into utilizing PledgeMusic upon the suggestion of their band manager, and pursued it because it allowed for close communication and feedback from the fanbase. Time Travelers & Bonfires is the follow-up to Sevendust's ninth studio album, Black Out the Sun, which debuted at #1 on Billboard's \\"Top Hard Music Albums' chart. Touring Following the release of album, Sevendust started 'An Evening With Sevendust' acoustic tour, which was kicked off in Athens, Georgia at the Georgia Theatre on April 1, 2014. It's their first acoustic tour since 2004, when they were touring in support of their fourth album, Seasons. Also the band recently announced that they planned for a second leg to 'An Evening With' acoustic trek which is starting in St. Louis on May 27 and goes through June 28, ending in Kent, Connecticut. According to Clint Lowery, the two legs will cover most of the areas of the United States. Sevendust also have added dates for the final leg of acoustic tour. Dates began on November 4 and ran through November 26th, 2014. Reception The album received generally favorable reviews from music critics. Gregory Heaney from Allmusic gave the album three out of five stars, describing it as \\"Time Travelers & Bonfires gives fans of the band a clearer look at the emotional core that lives at the heart of Sevendust's music, further stressing the importance of singer Lajon Witherspoon's vocal performances.\\" The About.com review gave the album three and a half out of five stars, praised lead singer voice, saying that \\"Witherspoon is the focus on all the songs and especially so on Come Down. He is always been a controlled modulator of the melody, a vocalist who gets it right and never leaves a bad aftertaste.\\" Thomas Woroniak from Rock Revolt Magazine, stated \\"Time Travelers & Bonfires shines with energy throughout the twelve tracks...This is a must have for any Sevendust fan of old and the acoustic format potentially opens their music to a wider demographic...just as intense as any of their previous studio releases.\\" The album was Revolver's album of the week upon its release. Singles \\"Black\\" is the album's first single, which is already getting spins on Octane (Sirius XM) channel, is currently available on iTunes and other digital outlets.

The Treatise is regarded as the first significant Chinese work on the West and one of China's initial responses to the Anglo-Chinese First Opium War (18391842). Eventually stretching to one hundred juan, or scrolls, the treatise contains numerous maps and much geographical detail covering both the western and eastern hemispheres. Wei's book also garnered significant interest in Japan and helped mould the country's foreign policy with respect to the West.  Background  During his term in Canton (now Guangzhou) as Special Imperial Commissioner, Lin Zexu observed the might of British naval power and the inadequacies of the Chinese coastal defence system at first hand. Along with other intellectuals of the time, Lin's objective was \\"to determine the source and nature of Western power in Asia and to discover Western objectives in East Asia.\\" The commissioner hired four Chinese translators who had been trained by missionaries to assist with the task of obtaining and translating appropriate western texts. One of them, Liang Jinde (), an assistant to missionary Elijah Coleman Bridgman, provided copies of The Chinese Repository and other works. Lin also purchased a copy of the 1834 Encyclopedia of Geography by Hugh Murray from the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, which Liang translated to become the draft for Lin's own Geography of the Four Continents (). However, before the book could be published, the First Opium War broke out in 1839 and the project was shelved. When the war ended in 1842, Lin's exile to the remote northwestern city of Yili meant that he passed his draft manuscript to Wei Yuan with a request that he complete it. Lin's contributions to the treatise proved so important that Karl G√ºtzlaff mistakenly attributed the work to him in his September 1847 review for the Chinese Repository.  Content  As well as mapping various countries, Wei's objective was to provide as complete a picture as possible of the advantages they possessed in shipbuilding techniques and weapons production so that these \\"might be turned to use for subduing them.\\" Wei completed his investigations of western penetration into East Asia in 1841, and in the Treatise proposed the construction of a shipyard and arsenal at Canton and the employment of foreign engineers to teach marine navigation and weapons operation \\"pioneer ideas in the military history of modern China\\".  Structure and editions  > \\"[It] divides the whole into eighteen parts, which are set forth in > classical and somewhat obscure language. The 1st section enjoins the > necessity of taking advantage of barbarian power and inventions, to resist > the barbarians and to be on a proper footing with them. This may be said to > be the grand object of the book, which then proceeds to give a geographical > and historical account of all the nations in Europe, Asia, Africa and > America. The closing chapters direct attention to the superiority of > barbarians in their method of circulating news, ship-building, and gunnery; > and are filled with woodcuts representing things and processes &c.; Amongst > barbarians, the English occupy a prominent place.\\" ::::: ‚ÄîThe Chinese > Repository Volume XIX January‚ÄìDecember, 1850; p. 135 The first edition of the Illustrated Treatise on the Maritime Kingdoms, comprising 50 juan or scrolls, was published on January3 1843. This was followed in 1847 with a reorganised and slightly longer version running to 60 juan, while the third and final edition of 100 juan appeared in 1852. As the editions progressed, each in turn featured new maps and geographical information regarding the West, using material that became available after the First Opium War.  Impact  Map of England from the H«éigu√≥t√∫zh√¨ Although on publication the Treatise received scant attention in China, in the longer term, Wei and his contemporaries helped change the Chinese view of the outside world not only through the dissemination of new material but also by starting to change the view that China was the \\"center of civilization\\" or \\"center of the world\\" (\\"Middle Kingdom\\"). \\"...dissolve the Sinocentric view by showing that China was in reality not the 'Middle Kingdom'\\" Wei's work was also to have a later impact on Japanese foreign policy. In 1862, samurai Takasugi Shinsaku, from the ruling Japanese Tokugawa shogunate, visited Shanghai on board the trade ship Senzaimaru. Japan had been forced open by US Commodore Matthew C. Perry less than a decade earlier and the purpose of the mission was to establish how China had fared following the country's defeat in the Second Opium War (18561860). Takasugi was aware of the forward thinking exhibited by those such as Wei on the new threats posed by Western \\"barbarians\\" and later recorded in his diary: \\"The philosophy of the Chinese people stands poles apart from the correct path for China's future development. They are infatuated with lofty words unrelated to reality.\\" Sinologist Joshua Fogel concludes that when Takasugi found out \\"that the writings of Wei Yuan were out of print in China and that the Chinese were not forcefully preparing to drive the foreigners out of their country, rather than derive from this a long analysis of the failures of the Chinese people, he extracted lessons for the future of Japan\\". Similarly, after reading the Treatise, scholar and political reformer Yokoi Sh≈çnan became convinced that Japan should embark on a \\"cautious, gradual and realistic opening of its borders to the Western world\\" and thereby avoid the mistake China had made in engaging in the First Opium War. Takasugi would later emerge as a leader of the 1868 Meiji Restoration which presaged the emergence of Japan as a modernised nation at the beginning of the 20th century. Yoshida Sh≈çin, influential Japanese intellectual and Meiji reformer, said Wei's Treatise had \\"made a big impact in our country\\".

The war was caused by unwarranted and undeserved maltreatment from the then King of Nnewi who would always compel the young men and women of the neighbouring communities to take particular days that they would go and work for him, and which they were to go with their foods and water, as there were no provisions for any refreshment made by the king, who never rewarded, entertained nor appreciated the labourers in anyway. Hence, the then newly emerged Ukpor king determined never to tolerate but to put a perpetual end to such an inhumane act; and consequently issued an order condemning and prohibiting that. This infuriated the king of Nnewi, that he pronounced a war against those neighbouring communities for their act which he term 'rebellious'; and they began the war with their nearest community which is the present-day Ukpor, which preparedly had already united and strategized with the nine villages that made up the Ekweteghete, being the general name of the nine villages that were subjected to the unrewarded compulsory labour. It was in celebration of this victory which Ukpor recorded in the War of Agbaja that the then king (Eze Obiukwu) decided to kill a cow for the people and call for merriment; and other villages which shared in the victory 'hit their chests' and determined that they would also bring their own cows, all of which were then sampled and hauled round the village square, with a view to knowing which village came with the biggest cow. These cows were thereafter killed and used for merriment which was then named 'Asara', coming from the Igbo word 'Saraka' which implies merriment.

When the Committee was replaced by the Imperial Munitions Board in December 1915, he was appointed as one of its members, and continued to serve as such until 1919. In 1915 he was appointed by the Canadian Government to chair a Commission to inquire into the feasibility of refining zinc and copper in Canada, and he also conducted an inquiry into what coke oven capacity existed in Canada for the production of toluol (a key component of trinitrotoluene). He was Chairman of the Inventions Committee in Canada. He was appointed an Honorary Lieutenant-Colonel of the Canadian Militia in 1915, and became an Honorary Colonel in 1916, on his appointment as Consulting Technical Ordnance Adviser to the Department of Militia and Defence.
