It was established on September 27, 1962, making it the oldest tertiary education institution in East Kalimantan. With more than 35,000 students, Universitas Mulawarman is the university with the most students in Kalimantan. Its main campus is in Gunung Kelua, while other campuses are in Pahlawan Road, Banggeris Street and Flores Street of Samarinda. History The name Mulawarman was taken from the king Mulawarman Nala Dewa of the Kutai Kingdom in 4th century, historically the earliest kingdom in Indonesia, located in East Kalimantan. Beginnings On June 6, 1962 the Governor of East Kalimantan Province, Aji Pangeran Tumenggung Pranoto, founded Perguruan Tinggi Mulawarman (Mulawarman College), located in Samarinda.Governor of East Kalimantan Decree Number 15/PPK/KDH/1962 Then the Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture approved the establishment as Universitas Mulawarman on September 28, 1962Ministry of Education and Culture Decree Number 130/1962 and officially confirmed by the President on April 23, 1963.Presidential Decree Number 65/1963 The date of September 27, 1962 was set as the date of the founding of the Universitas Mulawarman. At first the Universitas Mulawarman had four faculties: Faculty of State and Trade Administration, Faculty of Agriculture, Faculty of Forestry and Faculty of Mining in Balikpapan. Only the Faculty of State and Trade Administration could be started at the opening in 1962, the Faculty of Agriculture followed in 1964. In 1966, the Faculty of State and Trade Administration was split into the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences and Faculty of Economics. 1970s-1980s Due to difficulty to find teaching staff, the Faculty of Mining, in Balikpapan, was closed in 1970. In 1978, the Samarinda Teaching and Education Sciences Institute was integrated into Universitas Mulawarman as the Faculty of Teaching and Education Sciences on March 20.Ministry of Education and Culture, Directorate General of Higher Education Decree Number 181/D/E/1978 Thus since September 7, 1982, there were five faculties in Universitas Mulawarman:Presidential Decree Number 66/1982 Faculty of Agriculture, Faculty of Economics, Faculty of Forestry, Faculty of Teaching and Education Sciences, and Faculty of Social and Political Sciences.

A lattice in the Euclidean plane. In musical tuning, a lattice \\"is a way of modeling the tuning relationships of a just intonation system. It is an array of points in a periodic multidimensional pattern. Each point on the lattice corresponds to a ratio (i.e., a pitch, or an interval with respect to some other point on the lattice). The lattice can be two-, three-, or n-dimensional, with each dimension corresponding to a different prime-number partial .\\"Gilmore, Bob (2006). \\"Introduction\\", p.xviii, \\"Maximum Clarity\\" and Other Writings on Music, edited by Bob Gilmore. Urbana: University of Illinois Press. . When listed in a spreadsheet a lattice may be referred to as a tuning table. The points in a lattice represent pitch classes (or pitches if octaves are represented), and the connectors in a lattice represent the intervals between them. The connecting lines in a lattice display intervals as vectors, so that a line of the same length and angle always has the same intervalic relationship between the points it connects, no matter where it occurs in the lattice. Repeatedly adding the same vector (repeatedly stacking the same interval) moves you further in the same direction. Lattices in just intonation (limited to intervals comprising primes, their powers, and their products) are theoretically infinite (because no power of any prime equals any power of another prime). However, lattices are sometimes also used to notate limited subsets that are particularly interesting (such as an Eikosany illustrated further below or the various ways to extract particular scale shapes from a larger lattice). Examples of musical lattices include the Tonnetz of Euler (1739) and Hugo Riemann and the tuning systems of Ben Johnston. Musical intervals in just intonation are related to those in equal tuning by Adriaan Fokker's Fokker periodicity blocks. Many multi-dimensional higher-limit tunings have been mapped by Erv Wilson. The limit is the highest prime number used in the ratios that define the intervals used by a tuning. Thus Pythagorean tuning, which uses only the perfect fifth (3/2) and octave (2/1) and their multiples (powers of 2 and 3), is represented through a two- dimensional lattice (or, given octave equivalence, a single dimension), while standard (5-limit) just intonation, which adds the use of the just major third (5/4), may be represented through a three-dimensional lattice though \\"a twelve-note 'chromatic' scale may be represented as a two-dimensional (3,5) projection plane within the three-dimensional (2,3,5) space needed to map the scale. (Octave equivalents would appear on an axis at right angles to the other two, but this arrangement is not really necessary graphically.)\\".

This template can be used with any 6 ratios Erv Wilson has made significant headway with developing lattices than can represent higher limit harmonics, meaning more than 2 dimensions, while displaying them in 2 dimensions. Here is a template he used to generate what he called an \\"Euler\\" lattice after where he drew his inspiration. Each prime harmonic (each vector representing a ratio of 1/n or n/1 where n is a prime) has a unique spacing, avoiding clashes even when generating lattices of multidimensional, harmonically based structure. Wilson would commonly use 10-squares-to-the-inch graph paper. That way, he had room to notate both ratios and often the scale degree, which explains why he didn't use a template where all the numbers where divided by 2. The scale degree always followed a period or dot to separate it from the ratios.

Early in 1532 he became chancellor of the diocese of Worcester through the intercession of Edmund Bonner with Thomas Cromwell.

In 1534 Cromwell suspected Bagard of disloyalty to the cause of the Reformation, and Bagard replied to the accusation in a long letter asserting his anxiety \\"to tender the king's pleasure\\".

Melbourne's suburban railway network consists of 16 electrified lines, the central City Loop subway, and 200 stations, with a total length of 372 km of electrified lines. The network is primarily at ground level, with a number of level crossings, and tracks shared with freight trains and V/Line regional services. Tram operations are also covered by the Rail Safety Act. Trams are a major form of public transport in Melbourne which is home to the largest tram network in the world, (following the dismantling of much of Saint Petersburg's tramway tracks early in the 21st century). Melbourne's network consists of of track, 500 trams,Yarra Trams Facts & Figures 28 routes, and 1,813 tram stops.TramTracker News Release The Rail Safety Act 2006 is a law enacted by the Parliament of the State of Victoria, Australia, and is the prime statute regulating the safety of rail operations in Victoria. The Act was developed as part of the Transport Legislation Review conducted by the Department of Transport between 2004 and 2010 and is aimed at preventing deaths and injuries arising from rail operations. The Act was the State's first dedicated statute on the subject and replaced provisions in the former Transport Act 1983.This Act is now known under the title Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983. The Act forms part of the transport policy and legislation framework in Victoria set by the Transport Integration Act 2010,Transport Integration Act 2010 - see paragraph (m) in the definition of \\"transport legislation\\" in section 3. and its provisions are subject to the overarching transport system vision, transport system objectives and decision making principles set out in the Transport Integration Act. The Act was passed in early 2006 and commenced on 1 August of that year. The Act also established Victoria's first independent transport safety regulator, the Director, Public Transport Safety. In 2010 the statutory office of Director, Public Transport Safety was replaced by the Director, Transport Safety. Though functionally independent, the Director is part of the Department of Transport and reports to the relevant Ministers.Transport Integration Act 2010, section 194. The responsible Minister for the Act is the Minister for Public Transport, currently Jacinta Allan.  Outline  The stated purpose of the Act is \\"...to provide for safe rail operations in Victoria\\".Rail Safety Act 2006, section 1. The objects of the Act center on the safety of rail operations, management of safety risks, continuous improvement in rail safety management, public confidence in the safety of rail transport and appropriate stakeholder involvement.Rail Safety Act 2006, section 11(1). The Act also contains a number of overarching policy principles relating to shared responsibility, accountability for managing safety risks, integrated risk management, enforcement, transparency, consistency and stakeholder involvement.Rail Safety Act 2006, Part 2. The Act establishes a regulatory scheme with the following key elements: * a number of performance based safety duties applying to a broad range of parties who can affect rail safety outcomesRail Safety Act 2006, Part 3. * an accreditation scheme concentrating on key rail industry operational partiesRail Safety Act 2006, Part 5. * a requirement that rail operators have a safety management system in placeRail Safety Act 2006, Division 4 of Part 3. * a broad range of sanctions and penaltiesThe Rail Safety Act 2006 amended the then Transport Act 1983 in respect of these matters. The Transport Act has since been renamed the Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983. See Part 7 of that Act. * cost benefit protections against excessive action by the regulator against industry participantsCost benefit protections were positioned as a key balancing element in the Rail Safety Act scheme and a guard against a \\"feral\\" regulator or a \\"gold plated\\" safety approach to safety requirements. The Rail Safety Act initially amended the Transport Act 1983 to include the protections. The protections have since been transferred to the Transport Integration Act 2010 - see section 175. * alcohol and drug controls on rail safety workersRail Safety Act, Part 6. * provision for the making of codes of practice to give guidance to regulated rail industry parties.Rail Safety Act 2006, Part 8. The Act also established the State's first dedicated public transport safety regulator - the Director, Public Transport Safety - which was created as an independent statutory office.Note, this office has since been abolished. The office was subsumed within a broader transport safety office - the Director, Transport Safety - on 1 July 2010 by operation of provisions in the Transport Integration Act 2010. See, for example, section 171. The former office had jurisdiction over rail and bus safety matters only. The new independent transport safety office combines those functions with marine safety responsibilities previously regulated by the Director of Marine Safety under the Marine Act 1988.  Parts  V/Line Corporation in regional Victoria such as this Vlocity train captured operating near Lara are also regulated by the Rail Safety Act. The Act is divided into ten parts: # Preliminary # Principles of Rail Safety # Rail Safety Duties and Other Safety Requirements # Protection and Control of Rail Operations # Accreditation of Rail Infrastructure and Rolling Stock Operations # Alcohol and Other Drug Controls for Rail Safety Workers # Review of Decisions # Codes of Practice # General # Other Amendments to Acts, Savings and Transitional  Coverage  The Act regulates the safety compliance of most rail transport in Victoria including heavy and light rail systems, public and private sidings, tramways and tourist and heritage rail operations.Rail Safety Act 2006, see the definition of \\"railway\\" in section 3. The main railways regulated by the Act include the Melbourne heavy rail system, the Melbourne tram and light rail network, Victoria's regional standard and broad gauge rail networks and regional tourist and heritage railways. Railways excluded from coverage under the Act include railways in mines, amusement and theme park railways and slipways.Rail Safety Act 2006, section 6.  Duties  Colac is a railway station in the town of Colac in regional Victoria. The station is serviced by V/Line passenger trains on the Warrnambool railway line. V/Line has responsibilities under the Rail Safety Act for the safety of its rail operations on this line and the other lines which form parts of its operation. Part 3 of the Act sets out a number of performance based safety duties which are required to be observed by designated rail industry participants including: * rail infrastructure managersRail Safety Act 2006, section 20. (including persons in charge of rail tracks) * rolling stock operatorsRail Safety Act 2006, section 21. * rail contractorsRail Safety Act 2006, section 22. * labour-hire entitiesRail Safety Act 2006, section 23. * rail safety workers. \\"Rail contractor\\" is defined broadly by the Act to include a range of persons including those involved in design, construction, manufacture, supply, installation, maintenance, repair and modification who knows or ought reasonably to know that things were to be used as rail infrastructure or rolling stock.Rail Safety Act 2006, section 22(1). The typical formulation of a safety duty specifies that persons in this category must ensure the safety of things for which they are responsible \\"so far as is reasonably practicable\\"Rail Safety Act 2006 - see, for example, section 22(2) which specifies the duty of rolling stock operators although the formulation varies according to the party. Rail infrastructure managers and rolling stock operators, for example, are also required to provide or maintain systems of rail safety work that are, so far as is reasonably practicable, safe.Rail Safety Act 2006 - see, for example, section 22(1) in relation to rolling stock operators. Penalties for breach of the safety duties are substantial and vary among natural person and body corporate offenders. The framework of safety duties in the Act seeks to give practical effect to the so-called \\"chain of responsibility\\" concept in the rail safety sector.The chain of responsibility concept emanated from the heavy vehicle sector in Australia. The concept has since spread in Victoria to the rail safety, bus safety, marine safety, taxi and accident towing sectors. That concept seeks to identify the parties who are in a sufficient position of control over risks, in this case to safety, and to allocate responsibility by law accordingly.  Accreditation scheme  Two key parties responsible for the direct operation of railways in Victoria, rail infrastructure managers and rolling stock operators, are not permitted to operate under the Act unless they are granted accreditation by the regulator.Rail Safety Act 2006 - see sections 36 and 37. The purpose of accreditation is to attest to an operator's competence and capacity to manage the risks to safety associated with their rail operations.Rail Safety Act 2006, section 35. Matters applicants are required to demonstrate under the scheme are that their safety management system complies with the Act, that they have sufficient financial capacity or insurance to meet potential accident liabilities, and other matters.Rail Safety Act 2006, section 38.  Safety management systems  Caulfield station in Melbourne, showing signalling and overhead wiring. Certain rail operators, that is infrastructure managers and rolling stock operators,Rail Safety Act 2006, section 3, definition of \\"rail operator\\". are required to have a safety management system (SMS) to ensure the safe management of their rail operations.Rail Safety Act 2006, Division 4 of Part 3. See in particular, section 27. A safety management system must be documented and \\"...provide a comprehensive and integrated management system...\\" setting out all risks and control measures.Rail Safety Act 2006, section 25. In essence, the SMS is the key safety plan for those parties who have ground level operational responsibilities in the rail sector.  Compliance  Compliance-related provisions to support the Rail Safety Act scheme were not included in that Act and instead were included in the then Transport Act 1983 (since renamed, the Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983).Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983, Part 7. The compliance support scheme centres on provisions enabling the appointment of authorised officers, conferral of coercive powers and a range of administrative and court-based sanctions. The key elements are: * appointment of officers transport safety officersTransport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983, subdivision 2 of Division 4B of Part 7. * powers relating to entry to railway premises, inspection, securing sites, use of force and seizure of thingsTransport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983, subdivisions 4, 7 and 8 of Division 4B of Part 7. * powers to search, enter and require production of documents and information and to require name and address detailsTransport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983, subdivision 5 of Division 4B of Part 7. * sanctions and penalties such as improvement notices, prohibition notices and infringement noticesTransport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983, subdivisions 9 to 11A of Division 4B of Part 7. * powers to initiate prosecutions, receive safety undertakings and impose commercial benefits penalty orders, supervisory intervention orders, exclusion orders and adverse publicity orders.Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983, Division 6 of Part 7.  Responsible regulator  The Director, Transport Safety, who operates as Transport Safety Victoria, is the responsible regulator for the application and enforcement of the Act, and the regulation of safety performance of the rail sector in Victoria. The office was created by the Transport Integration Act 2010.Transport Integration Act 2010, section 171. It commenced on 1 July 2010 and subsumed the former office of the Director, Public Transport Safety within a broader transport safety office. The Director is part of the Department of Transport, but is functionally independent of the Department and responsible Ministers, except in limited circumstances.Transport Integration Act 2010, section 191 (the Minister may compel the Director to investigate a particular matter) and 193(2). The Director reports to the relevant Ministers.  Development  The Rail Safety Act requires certain rail industry workers to have a zero blood alcohol content and to be unimpaired by particular drugs when they undertake rail safety-sensitive tasks such as driving trains or trams, operating signals, etc. Workers are subject to testing for these substances including by breath analysis equipment. Severe penalties apply if workers breach the requirements of the Act.  Regulatory scheme  The development of the proposal for the Act was managed by the former Department of Infrastructure in VictoriaThe successor to the Department of Infrastructure in rail safety and other areas is the Department of Transport. as part of its Transport Legislation Review project. The Department released an issues paper outlining the broad policy outline for rail safety scheme legislation in May 2004.The paper was titled \\"Improving Rail Safety in Victoria: issues paper for a review of the rail safety regulatory framework\\" and was released on 24 May 2004. The paper outlined a series of concerns about the former rail safety regulation framework in Victoria including concerns about safety trends and outcomesImproving Rail Safety in Victoria, Department of Infrastructure, May 2004, Parts B. and comparisons with schemes in overseas jurisdictions.Improving Rail Safety in Victoria, Department of Infrastructure, May 2004, Parts C, D and E. Comments on the issues paper were requested from industry parties and other interested stakeholders. Comments received from industry, government and other stakeholders resulted in the refinement of the proposal and changes to its design.For example, the Department's initial proposal for a \\"safety case\\" proposal was not pursued in the legislation presented to the Victorian Parliament.  Governance scheme  The proposal for a new public transport regulator was developed separately but concurrently with the development of the rail safety regulatory scheme. The Department commissioned a further review which led to a detailed report on the subject.Review of the Role and Accountability Arrangements for Public Transport and Marine Safety Regulation in Victoria, TFG International Pty Ltd, November 2004. The review examined governance arrangements for safety regulation in the public transport sector drawing on Australian and overseas models. Recommendations were made aimed at improving the governance, accountability and methodology of the then public transport regulator which at that time obtained its powers to regulate safety through delegation from the Secretary of the Department of Infrastructure.Transport Act 1983. Particular concerns were expressed about the lack of independence of the regulator function and the perceived lack of clarity about its charter and accountabilities as well as conflict of interest concerns.Review of the Role and Accountability Arrangements for Public Transport and Marine Safety Regulation in Victoria, TFG International Pty Ltd, November 2004 - see findings relating to terms of reference 3 for the review, page 5. Ultimately, the review recommended the creation of an independent statutory office with a clearer charter and accountability arrangements.Review of the Role and Accountability Arrangements for Public Transport and Marine Safety Regulation in Victoria, TFG International Pty Ltd, November 2004 - see findings relating to terms of reference 4 for the review, pages 5-6. The governance review also examined the case for merging the public transport regulator with the then Victorian marine safety regulator, the Director of Marine Safety.This office was established under the Marine Act 1988. While not recommended at that time, the review found that integration of the functions could be examined in two to three years time once the public transport regulatory schemes had been settled and further examination of marine safety regulation had occurred. The Victorian Government ultimately pursued the full integration of its public transport and marine safety regulators five years later as part of its Transport Integration Act proposal.Transport Integration Act 2010, section 171 and related amendments to the Marine Act 1988. Ultimately, the proposals for both a new rail safety regulation scheme and new public transport safety governance arrangements were presented to the Victorian Parliament as proposed legislation in early October 2005.  Parliamentary approval  The tram Stop outside Federation Square in Melbourne. The regulatory scheme in the Rail Safety Act applies to the activities of rail operators and other parties in relation to these facilities as well as to the safety of rails, rolling stock, signals etc.  Introduction  The Rail Safety Act was introduced into the lower house of the Victorian Parliament, the Victorian Legislative Assembly, as the Rail Safety Bill. The Bill was introduced at the same time as the Transport Legislation (Safety Investigations) Bill, a proposal to establish an independent public transport and marine safety investigator in Victoria, and the Bills were debated together.This process is available under Victorian Parliamentary procedure and the Bills become known as cognate Bills. The responsible Minister for both Bill proposals was the then Minister for Transport, Peter Batchelor. The Minister moved the second reading of the Rail Safety Bill on 6 October 2005 and set the context for the Bill in his speech in support as follows: ::\\"This Bill heralds a new era in rail safety in Victoria. While Victoria has a proud rail safety record over the 150 years of rail operations in the State, new enhanced rail safety regulation and public transport governance is essential in order to maintain our current high safety levels and to generate continuous safety improvements in the future. ::Government and transport operators must remain vigilant about rail safety performance. Together, we need to seek further safety improvements in an industry where, as international and interstate experiences show, incidents have the potential for serious consequences for life and limb. This is a particular issue for Victoria where the responsibility for the delivery and operation of passenger and freight rail services has been largely devolved to private operators and away from direct Government control. ::Victoria's challenge, and more broadly the challenge for the nation, is to learn from the safety regulation improvements in other jurisdictions and industries and to adopt best practice regulation that facilitates better hazard identification and risk management -- activities aimed at preventing incidents, and at mitigating their consequences if ever they do occur. With these considerations in mind, it has been a key objective of the Government to develop a contemporary best practice rail safety regime for the State.\\"Parliament of Victoria, Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 6 October 2005.  Debate, criticism and amendments  The Bill which became the Rail Safety Act was considered by the Victorian Parliament between early October 2005 and late March 2006. The Rail Safety Act policy framework was later adopted nationally and has now been replicated in laws passed by the legislatures in all Australian States and the Northern Territory. The Rail Safety Bill was the subject of a reasoned amendment moved by the then Opposition shadow Transport Minister Terry Mulder on 1 March 2006 in the Legislative Assembly. The amendment sought to defer the Parliament's consideration of the Bill pending the approval of a national model Rail Safety Bill which had adopted the Victorian policy framework but which was being developed on a later timetable by the National Transport Commission.See National Context below. The text of the reasoned amendment moved by Mr Mulder was 'this house refuses to read this Bill a second time until a final resolution has been reached by all States in relation to the National Transport Commission's draft Rail Safety Bill and that further discussion has been entered into via invitation from the Federal Government to simplify regulation for rail operators in all States'. Parliament of Victoria, Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 1 March 2006. Mulder stated: ::\\"The National Transport Commission has developed a model Bill for rail safety throughout Australia and is still in the process of consulting with industry groups and State Governments. Victoria has jumped the gun and decided to go it alone. As indicated in the second-reading speeches, the Government proposes to tidy up the legislation as it moves forward.\\"Parliament of Victoria, Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 1 March 2006. ::\\"In reality the rail industry is looking for and wants a single regulator. It wants simplification and regulations which are uniform across all States. As I have said, the Minister was not prepared to do that. I understand that the Victorian Government has agreed to follow several provisions of the model Bill. But there are other parts of the model Bill that the minister has not seen fit to follow. This has all the hallmarks of the Victorian Government trying to take the agenda away from the National Transport Commission, putting in place a process and trying to drive the agenda from that point forward.\\" In response, the Minister observed that: ::(Members) have spoken on a landmark piece of legislation which sees Victoria leading and not following. We are leading the way in national rail safety reform. We are achieving objectives that many State Transport Ministers have been attempting to achieve along with their national colleagues. .... This is an important piece of legislation because the Rail Safety Bill will become the model legislation for all other Australian jurisdictions.\\"Parliament of Victoria, Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 1 March 2006. The Government moved a series of amendments to the Bill during the latter stages of its passage in the Legislative Assembly largely to give effect to national alignment matters agreed between the Department of Infrastructure and the National Transport Commission.  Passage, assent and commencement  The Rail Safety Bill was passed by the Legislative Assembly on 1 March 2006 and was introduced into the Victorian Legislative Council on 2 March 2006.Parliament of Victoria, Hansard, Legislative Council, 2 March 2006. Second reading was moved in the Council on 28 March and the Bill was ultimately passed without further amendment on 29 March 2006.Parliament of Victoria, Hansard, Legislative Council, 28 and 29 March 2006 The Rail Safety Bill received Royal Assent on 4 April 2006 to become the Rail Safety Act 2006.See www.legislation.vic.gov.au, Parliamentary Documents, archive for 2006 Bills of the Victorian Parliament. The Act was ultimately proclaimed to commence on 1 August 2006. The Rail Safety Regulations 2006 which were required to support the operation of the Act also operated from the same date thereby formally commencing the new rail safety regulation scheme.  Amendments to the Act  The Act has been subject to some significant amendments since it was passed in 2006. These include requirements on rail infrastructure managers and road managers since 1 July 2010 to enter into \\"safety interface agreements\\".Rail Safety Act 2006, Division 2 of Part 4. The scheme pursues the identification and management of risks to safety at road/rail crossings, particularly level crossings, as one means of improving safety outcomes at those locations.  National impact  This Pacific National cement train operating at Geelong in regional Victoria provides an example of a rail activity conducted by a national operator in Victoria which is regulated by the Rail Safety Act.  2006 Model Bill  The development and passage of the Rail Safety Act in Victoria in March 2006 was followed by policy and legislation developments at the national level. In June 2006, the Australian Transport Council approved a model Rail Safety Bill for adoption in law by the States and the Northern Territory. The regulatory framework in the national model Bill adopted the scheme set out in the Victorian Act. Accordingly, the Victorian legislation satisfied the core national scheme requirements and required small changes only to be compatible with the national draft. Adoption of the model national Bill was gradual. The national proposal was subsequently adopted by legislation in South Australia (in 2007), New South Wales (2008) and Tasmania (2009) and eventually in Western Australia (2010), the Northern Territory (2010) and Queensland (2010). Once it was clear that a majority of other jurisdictions had implemented the new framework, the Victorian Rail Safety Act was amended to acknowledge that the Victorian statute forms part of the nationally consistent rail safety schemeSection 11A of the Rail Safety Act 2006 provides that \\"(I) it is the intention of Parliament that this Act form part of a nationally consistent scheme that regulates and promotes the maintenance of, and continuous improvement in, rail safety.\\"  2008 centralisation proposal  A further national proposal emerged in 2008 at the instigation of the Rudd Government. This followed soon after the approval of the national model Rail Safety Bill and before most States and the Northern Territory were able to embed the model Bill into their local laws. The Australian Transport Council and the Council of Australian Governments are pursuing a centralisation proposal (sometimes called the \\"single national rail safety regulator\\") to establish a safety regulator for all rail operations in Australia including interstate railways and domestic state and territory urban systems (heavy rail, light rail and tram) and shortlines.see www.coag.gov.au The proposal forms part of a \\"seamless national economy\\" proposal being pursued by the Commonwealth GovernmentSww www.coag.gov.au. and COAG. The proposal envisages the establishment of an applied laws scheme and a central rail safety regulation bureaucracy for Australia located in Adelaide in South Australia and the abolition of the current rail safety regulators in the States and the Northern Territory.See COAG and ATC communiques since 2008. Negotiations are currently underway between the Commonwealth and States and Territories on this centralisation proposal. Final approval and adoption of legislation and other arrangements is still to occur. There has been both support for and opposition to the full centralised regulatory proposal since it was first raised.  Support  \\"The Overland\\" operating at Moorabool near Geelong in Victoria. The Overland is a passenger train between Melbourne, Victoria and Adelaide, South Australia. Operated by private company, Great Southern Rail, the train operates between the Melbourne terminal of Southern Cross, and Adelaide Parklands Terminal in Adelaide, and covers 828 kilometres between capitals.]. When in Victoria, the train operates under the Victorian Rail Safety Act and in South Australia under the companion South Australian Act of the same name. Coordinated regulatory activity is ensured by the regulators of each State and by the Rail Safety Regulators' Panel. The original centralisation concept has been supported by interstate rail interests and jurisdictions such as Tasmania, Queensland, South Australia, the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory. Those parties have argued that having separate rail safety regulators in each jurisdiction is inefficient and costly for the rail industry, particularly cross border operators, and also for Governments.See the submissions by these jurisdictions in response to the regulatory impact statement released in late 2008 in respect of the centralisation proposal. Supporters of the proposal have also asserted that Australia‚Äôs regulatory system for rail needs to be modernised to reflect a national approach to transport policy planning and to support the safe, efficient and sustainable growth of the railway industry. It has also been suggested that the establishment of a national rail safety administration will \\"...deliver better rail safety outcomes for Australia, as it will draw on a national pool of knowledge and resources\\".See National Transport Commission website as of July 2011. Advocates of the project have also suggested that the cost savings that might accrue as a result of more centralised rail safety laws and bureaucracy will result in better safety results because rail operators will use any monetary savings to improve their safety systems.Statements made by National Transport Commission staff and industry advocates during National Rail Safety Regulator Public Information Forums throughout Australia during July 2011. In addition, smaller jurisdictions generally see the rail safety regulation function as expensive and wish to shift costs to the Commonwealth Government. Concerns have also been expressed about the progress of harmonisation across Australia, including since the approval of the national model Rail Safety Bill.  Criticism  Tourist and heritage railway operations in Victoria are also regulated by the Rail Safety Act. This picture shows locomotive 12A on the Monbulk Creek trestle bridge near Belgrave just outside Melbourne. The train is operating as part of the famous Puffing Billy tourist railway. The centralised regulator proposal has been opposed at times by New South Wales, Victoria and the Western Australian rail safety regulator who have pointed to a lack of quantitative or qualitative evidence of impacts of the current jurisdiction-based national system on operator costs, particularly in light of the predominance of intrastate urban rail movements in Australia over interstate movements.See submissions made by jurisdictions into the centralised regulator concept. These jurisdictions have also pointed to the good performance of rail safety regulation in Australia in recent years which has seen long-term trends point to reductions in deaths and injuries from rail operations. Agreement has already been reached to excise the Melbourne tram system from the national proposal; however Victoria and New South Wales in particular have indicated ongoing difficulties with ceding safety control over the large Melbourne and Sydney suburban rail systems to an entity located in Adelaide. Some jurisdictions and stakeholders have contrasted the more decentralised regulatory position in other large rail federations, particularly the European Union and Canada, where countries and provinces retain strong local control of rail safety regulation and administration, especially in relation to urban and metro systems. Some concerns raised in this context have reflected on the lack of subsidiarity consideration evident in the national proposal. Concerns have also been expressed about the single mode aspect of the national centralisational proposal which would remove rail safety regulation from the New South Wales and Victorian regulators. Critics argue that the national proposal militates against the contemporary integrated transport directions evident in these larger jurisdictions in recent years.Victoria, for example, enacted a Transport Integration Act in 2010 which pursues a policy and organisational direction which contrasts sharply with the national rail safety regulation centralisation proposal. New South Wales too passed legislation in 2010 which conferred additional safety responsibilities on its multi-modal safety transport safety regulator. These directions have seen transport safety regulators becoming increasingly multi modal and covering modes such as rail, tram, bus and maritime in the one agency as a way of sharing safety expertise, reducing duplication and minimising opportunities for regulatory capture. The national proposal would reverse this modern trend and create a single rail safety regulator. Some stakeholders have criticised the safety credibility of the centralisation proposal, observing that the proposal is more directed at economic benefits rather than safety improvements and that, as a result, it has the potential to increase rail safety risks. Several stakeholders have also raised the prospect of any new regulator becoming subject to regulatory capture.For example, see the submission by Public Transport Victoria in response to the regulatory impact statement released in late 2008 in respect of the centralisation proposal.  Current directions  The centralisation proposal remains unresolved although the current proposal suggests a start up date of 1 January 2013 for a new systemSee communiques at www.coag.gov.au and outcomes from the Australian Transport Council. which is still in evolution. Recent developments suggest that a centralised regulator will be established to take over the rail safety regulation functions of a majority of jurisdictions but that the most populous jurisdictions such as New South Wales and Victoria and potentially other large rail States such as Queensland and Western Australia may retain a local regulatory presence under service level agreements. Jurisdictions which choose to operate under service level agreements may do so through their existing regulators operating in conjunction with the Adelaide-based national regulation bureaucracy and under centrally determined policy and operational directions.

It is located within the boundaries of Gernrode, a part of Quedlinburg.  History  In 1320 Count Henry of Stolberg bought the fortified manor house of Erichsberg, together with other goods and chattels, from Heineke of Hoym and Bertholdus II of Arnswald, known as Geylvus (today Geilfuss/ Geilfu√ü). The castle had first been mentioned in the 12th century and was probably built to protect a trading route. In order to protect his new possessions, he enfeoffed it, along with Wolfsberg Castle which he had purchased at the same time, in 1325 to the Bishop of Halberstadt. Count Henry of Stolberg left Erichsberg to his cousin, Hermann, who based mercenaries in the houses at Erichsberg that had ravaged Thuringian Land, especially the Counts of Hohnstein from Sondershausen. Whereupon in 1346 Margrave Frederick together with the citizens of Erfurt, M√ºhlhausen and Nordhausen marched on the castle, took the Count of Stolberg prisoner and destroyed the site. The Erichsberg could not be rebuilt and its ruins were transferred to the Stolberg Amt of B√§renrode. Of the former castle, a few small remnants of the walls and short sections of the old ramparts and moat are still visible.

The term is in common use with two distinct meanings, the choice of which is influenced by the size and global reach of the organisation and the historical and geographic context. Further to this, the term is also used in reference to various technical (legal) definitions specific to corporate governance legislation in individual countries. Thus, a director can be any of: * A person appointed to act as the most senior manager of the company itself (Managing Director) or of a key function (Finance Director, Operations Director, etc.), in which case the title is analogous to and replaces the \\"C-Suite\\" titles, this might be considered as the british english meaning of the word. * A person from a group of managers who leads or supervises a particular area of a company, which might be considered to be the american english meaning of the word. * A person holding a \\"directorship\\" in a legal sense, who has specific legal duties and responsibilities for management of the company which they have been appointed to the board of. Within companies that use this term in the latter (american english) sense it would be normal to have directors spread throughout different business functions or roles (e.g. director of human resources). In such a case, the director usually reports directly to a vice president or to the CEO directly in order to let them know the progress of the organization. Large organizations may also have \\"assistant\\" or \\"deputy\\" directors. In this context, Director commonly refers to the lowest level of executive in an organization, but many large companies use the title of associate director more frequently. When used by a firm who uses the title director in the british english sense, being termed as an \\"executive director\\" would generally imply that the holder is appointed to the board of directors in a legal sense, and holds significant responsibility and/or a financial stake in the business. By contrast in the american english context \\"executive director\\" is roughly equivalent to vice president or senior director in some businesses. Such companies may also have \\"regional\\" and/or \\"area directors\\", with regional director titles tending to be used by companies that are organized by location and have their departments under that, indicating near total responsibility for the operations for their particular country. Corporate titles Corporate titles (commonly known as business titles) are titles given to individuals within a business depending on the role they have and which also portray the duties and responsibilities within that specific role. The larger the business, the more titles that are present, such as CEO, COO and executive directors. Those that have higher roles within a company such as the elite positions are often referred to as \\"chief\\" and those that have lower roles within the company are employees that simply carry out day-to-day tasks. There are many titles within a company such as executive director, managing director, company director and chairman. The corporate structure consists of four key areas: * Board of directors- oversees a department and maintains full operational responsibilities area is next to the C-level executives in the corporate jobs hierarchy. They oversee daily tasks of the business or the company. * Employees- This role is ranked at the bottom of the structure. Employees work on daily tasks and objectives either in a group or individually aiming for that common goal.  Structuring a board of directors  Depending upon the size of an organization or a company, the number of directors can vary. Start-up companies can have a single director, which is the minimum for a private limited company according to the law. However, as organizations and businesses expand, the number of directors can increase because more tasks and responsibilities become present. For example, if the company expands and has more than one department, such as finance, sales, marketing, production and IT, then the business may form a board of directors, with each director overseeing a department and maintaining full responsibility within that department. A board of directors ensures that a clearly outlined structure is in place which will help the business to work much more efficiently. Larger businesses and organizations will form a clear board structure as the following: Chairman - This particular role within the company is often a non executive role that also has the task of overseeing the entire business or organization. Managing Director - A managing director is employed by the business, often by the chairman. Other roles include running the business and producing salaries. The managing director manages the board of directors and oversees the performance of the business, thus reporting back to the chairman. Executive Directors - A group of executive directors who each play a significant role within the company. They maintain full responsibility over their respective departments such as Finance, Marketing and Sales. Each director manages their department ensuring that tasks and objectives are being met. Executive directors also sit on the board. Non-executive directors - These advise the business by proposing different forms of strategy and also decide remuneration of the executive directors. Having a clear structure within the business has a positive impact on the employees and it also helps to organize the business. By having a team of executive directors, employees can report to their executive directors if a problem or an issue occurs. Managing director A managing director oversees the performance of the company as a whole and then has the duty to report back to the chairman or board of directors. The chairman or board of directors may set daily and weekly targets, which should be met by the employees that are working within their respective departments. The managing director also has the role to report their progress so the board can evaluate it to see if targets have been achieved. Roles include * Maintaining the overall performance of the company and in particular the departments within. * Producing and planning strategic operating plans and objectives for the long-term future. Also ensuring all short term targets have been achieved. * Keeping in regular contact with the board of directors or chairman and to maintain a positive relationship.  Executive director  An executive director within a company or an organization is usually from the board of directors and oversees a specific department within the organization such as Marketing, Finance, Production and IT. The Executive Director must ensure that all employees within his/her department are achieving the objectives which have been set and must also make daily decisions within the department. Roles include * Overseeing their specific department such as Finance, Marketing or Manufacturing. * Maintaining the role of a specified decision maker within the department. * Analyzing and evaluating the efficiency of day to day tasks within the departments and ensuring all objectives are being met.  Company director  A company director is one of the employees within a group of managers who maintains a prolific role within an organization and usually has the higher role within an organization. This is mainly because they decide on how to control the business and also make the final and key decisions.  Roles include  The company director(s) is mainly responsible for: * Ensuring the company's strategic objectives and plans which have been set are being met. * Analyzing and monitoring the progress of its employees towards achieving the objectives and targets set. * Appointing or hiring senior managers for certain departments such as Finance and Marketing.  Finance director  A finance director oversees and maintains full responsibility of the business's finance department. He/she is also responsible in ensuring that the chief executive and the board receive the flow of the financial information. Other responsibilities include producing annual accounts, maintaining control of complete transactions, setting out financial targets and budgets for the business and also managing the companies policies. The finance director may also report to the managing director.

He was also a topographical draftsman whose views were widely disseminated through prints.Anton Mirou, A river landscape with elegant figures on a path, a village on the far bank at Sotheby's Life Extensive Landscape with the Rest on the Flight into Egypt Anton Mirou was born in Antwerp where he was baptized on 4 May 1578 in the Cathedral of Our Lady. His family must have been Protestant as they left Antwerp in 1586 after the Fall of Antwerp. The family moved to Frankenthal where a younger brother was born. Mirou made in 1602 a declaration in Frankenthal that he was 24 years of age.Anton Mirou at the Netherlands Institute for Art History On stylistic grounds it is believed that he trained in Frankenthal under the prominent Flemish landscape Gillis van Coninxloo who resided there from 1588 to 1595. Another Flemish painter active in Germany called Hendrik Gijsmans was possibly also his teacher. He married in 1602 in Frankenthal with Susanneke Jaspersdr. van Conincxloo. According to an unknown source, he returned to Antwerp in 1620, where he possibly died. He must have died after 1621 and before 8 April 1627 as on the latter date his wife is mentioned as widow. Work He painted landscapes and is considered a member of the school of Frankenthal. The school of Frankenthal included the painters Gillis van Coninxloo, Pieter Schoubroeck, and Hendrik van der Borcht the elder and the latter's son.School of Frankenthal at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Artists of the school of Frankenthal at the Netherlands Institute for Art History River landscape with elegant figures on a path A majority of Miro's landscape are distinguished from those of his contemporaries by the presence of richly dressed figures that populate the woody paths. These figures often seem ill matched with their surroundings. In the River landscape with elegant figures on a path (at Sotheby's on 3 July 2013, London, lot 6) a magnificently dressed young lady is serenaded by a lute-playing gentleman while they stroll on a path along which there are several beggars. His early landscapes were influenced by his presumed master Gillis van Coninxloo. These landscapes depict abundant trees or shrubs, craggy mountains, waterfalls and rock formations and complex paths. After circa 1614 Mirou seems to have undergone the influence of another artist of Flemish descent active in Frankenthal called Pieter Schoubroeck. Mirou started from that time to paint village landscapes populated with many figures. Landscape with water mill, castle and buildings Mirou had a strong interest in topographical drawings. A series of 26 his views of Bad Schwalbach were turned into prints by Matthias Merian and published in an album entitled Novae quaedem ac paganae regiunculae circa acidulas Swalbacenses delineatae per Antonium Mirulem in aes vero incisae per Mathae Merianem (Some new and rural village views around the sour springs of Schwalbach, drawn by Anton Mirou but cut in copper by Matthias Merian, 1620) (Hollstein, xiv, nos 1‚Äì26).

The mine is a simple gallery throughout, gradually increasing in width. The general direction is along the young stem in the internodes in its long axis. On reaching a node where the large expanded base of the leaf-stalk closely embraces the greater part of the stem the mine follows the obstruction on a varying distance, eventually turning down into the next internode or retracing its way back in its old internode, turning again in a similar manner on reaching the other extremity. In this way the internodes become more or less occupied by long galleries, while at the nodes the mine may enlarge and envelop the stem. Blind branches are rarely found. The mine may at times become somewhat tortuous, and in places more or less expanded owing to several parts intercommunicating. As a general rule but one internode will be occupied by any one mine, though sometimes a mine may extend into two. Where two mines are occupying the rather small area offered by a single internode, their galleries may intermingle indiscriminately without any attempt at mutual avoidance. The colour of the mine is white at first, later white or a very pale brown. The frass is scanty, and in the earlier portions of the mine occupies a narrow central line in the gallery.

Release Greenhide was screened throughout most of Queensland without the use of a distribution agency. Charles and Elsa Chauvel personally transported prints of the film from town to town, and tried to convince theatre owners to replace booked American films with a local alternative. Prior to each screening, Elsa would provide a dramatic monologue and introduction. In Brisbane and Sydney, Greenhide screened through distributor Hoyts, and broke records in Brisbane. However the movie struggled to find distribution in country areas and the Southern cities. In 1927 it was reported the film still had to earn ‚Ç§6,030 to recoup all its costs, due in part to the large portion of box office earnings taken by distributors and exhibitors. This caused Australian Film Productions to go into voluntary liquidation in 1929. Later the liquidator left Brisbane and copies of the film were abandoned in a building and caught fire.

It is known from New Zealand.Global Taxonomic Database of Gracillariidae (Lepidoptera) Mine The wingspan is about 10 mm for females and 8 mm for males. The larvae feed on Nothopanax arboreum. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine is a simple gallery, white in colour, on the upper surface of the leaf. It increases in width very gradually. The larva on hatching burrows immediately into the leaf, and heads in a more or less of a straight line till the margin or midrib of the leaf is encountered, after which this obstacle is closely followed. Its course invariably takes it close around the greater portion or entire margin of the leaf, closely following the digitations and any incursions made by other insects, and also along one or both of the sides of the midrib, this forming a barrier only in its basal three-quarters. The gallery then follows a more or less tortuous course within these boundaries. If the leaf is large it will rarely cross earlier parts of its own track, and will wander in a vermiform manner along one half of the leaf, generally that half opposite the one on which the egg was laid. In smaller leaves, almost the entire upper surface will be mined in a very complicated manner, but there is never any tendency to blotch formation. Loops may be thrown out from the straight central portion of the gallery against the midrib, but never blind branches. The frass is black, very finely granular, and is irregularly distributed. As a rule it is deposited at the margins of the mine, alternately on either side in the early parts, but later is arranged in close curved lines, convex forwards, transversely across the gallery. In the final stages it tends to become somewhat fluid in character.

All of the available data is presented in a yearly fashion, and whenever possible dating back to 1960. Pordata was organized by the Francisco Manuel dos Santos Foundation,FFMS - Funda√ß√£o Francisco Manuel dos Santos created in 2009 by Alexandre Soares dos Santos and his family. FFMS, is presided by Prof. Ant√≥nio Barreto and set its main objective in promoting study, knowledge, information and public debate. When released to the public on February 23, 2010 under the direction of Prof. Maria Jo√£o Valente Rosa, Pordata included only contents about Portugal, nationally. On November 3, the Foundation, launches an extension of its database to the new Pordata Europe. It now includes not only data about Portugal, but also about the European Union, Schengen Area, United States and Japan. About Pordata Created by the Francisco Manuel dos Santos Foundation (FFMS) on February 23, 2010, Contemporary Portugal Database Pordata is a public service, free of charge of unlimited use. Pordata allows the user a fast access to the numbers of the Portuguese reality, spread out across different themes as diverse as population, justice, education, health, environment, among several others. All presented in a chronologic evolution starting, whenever possible in 1960. About 40 official sources in Pordata Portugal, and more than 20 in Pordata Europe are responsible for the rigorous and exempt treatment of the published numbers. With more than 70.000 series available, Pordata allows the analysis of different themes in the same search enviorement. Here, the user is able to use a vast set of both visualization tools (such as graphs and tables) and editing ones (%, variations, etc.). Directed by Professor Maria Jo√£o Valente Rosa, the project Pordata is the result of a sequence of studies coordinated and put to motion by Ant√≥nio Barreto in the Social Sciences Institute of Lisbon University dating back to the late 90s. FFMS believes that side by side with the rapid development of information and communication technologies, the general interest in statistics as suffered a significant growth in the last few years, putting it in a vital position inside the process of analyzing and knowing nowadays societies. According to Maria Jo√£o Valente Rosa, Pordata ‚Äúis trying to answer the needs of credible information, so many times disperse and with complex access, to a public as wider as possible‚Äù. Furthermore: ‚ÄúThis is a project destined to everybody, a real public service, thought out to a vast number of users that share in the interest of a deeper knowledge about Portugal, with trust, rigor and easy access.‚Äù.Pordata apresenta√ß√£o - Maria Jo√£o Valente Rosa After its original release Pordata had a second development stage, with the new European database. New themes and different approaches are scheduled to complete the already existing ones, such as the database expansion to the Portuguese regions and municipalities. Pordata Europe On November 3, 2010, FFMS released to the general public a new database, with the same characteristics, still inside the Pordata environment. The new database includes not only data about Portugal itself, as it did so far, but also allows access to new data about all the countries in the European Union and the Schengen Area. Also, in several tables, the user can find series about both the United States and Japan. Now it is possible to compare the evolution of different indicators not only about Portugal but from all around Europe as well. All of the editing and visualization tools are the same as before. This way, the software not only allows the Portuguese users to an easier and faster method of their national data analysis, as long as the information crosscheck with its European framing, but it also enables other users to search for information about their own countries.

They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine is a simple gallery, more or less straight in its direction. It is made entirely in the upper surface of the leaf. The mine starts in a more or less oblique direction till it reaches the midrib or margin of the leaf. It follows the margin till it reaches the end of the leaf, and it then either turns back alongside its former track or continues back along the barrier on the other half of the leaf. It never crosses the midrib except in its upper part. On the margin of the leaf the mine closely follows all the irregularities of the outline, and extends into the bases of the serrations of the leaf. Portions of the earlier mine may be enveloped by the later broader gallery. The colour of the mine is light green in fresh mines. Margins of the mine are fairly regular and white. The frass is almost fluid in nature, and occupies a fairly broad brown band in the centre of the early gallery, but in the wider part is dark green or black, and often forms an unbroken line on one side of the gallery.

He served as Economy Minister under President Eduard Shevardnadze from November 2001-November 2003. By 2004 Mze (meaning ‚ÄòSun‚Äô) was one of Georgia's leading channels, broadcasting a variety of content including popular political talk shows. However, over the course of the next few years Chkhartishvili sold all his shares in the company and it became the focus of concern for opposition politicians and independent commentators who suggested Mze was coming under pressure from the Georgian government for failing to keep in line politically. It eventually became wholly owned by Rustavi 2, another leading television company, and moved to broadcasting a programme of entertainment without any news coverage.http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=18619 Mze TV Suspends News, Civil Georgia, Tbilisi, 26 June 2008 Transfer of shares in Mze In July 2004 Georgian newspaper Rezonansi (Resonance) reported that Chkhartishvili sold shares in MZE to a fellow Georgian MP and ally of president Mikheil Saakashvili, David Bezhuashvili because he (Chkhartishvili) had fallen out of favour with Saakashvili's government and was trying to avoid arrest for financial abuses.http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&tx;_ttnews%5btt_news%5d=26679 Article in Rezonansi from July 26, 2004 cited in an article by Zaal Anjaparidze ‚ÄòGeorgian Media Shackled after Rose Revolution‚Äô in the Jamestown Foundation‚Äôs Eurasia Daily Monitor, July 28, 2004.

This was denied by the then Parliamentary Chairperson, Nino Burjanadze, who said she believed that the broadcasters had cancelled the programmes in question in order to ‚Äòlaunch new projects‚Äô.http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=6192 ‚ÄòOpposition concerned over freedom of speech‚Äô www.civil.ge, Tbilisi, 9 January 2004 In July 2005 Mze announced it would take its daily political talk show Archevanis Zgvarze (On the Edge of Choice) off air. It was reported that Irakli Imnaishvili, the show's anchor, announced on air on July 6 that his show would go out for the last time on July 8. Apparently this move came days after a key government member, Giga Bokeria, criticised Mze's coverage of civil unrest in Tbilisi, criticism which led opposition parliamentarians to accuse the government of putting pressure on independent media, which was in turn denied by the government. Mze put the withdrawal of the political talk show down to planned changes in broadcasting schedules. But the same report also said that On the Edge of Choice had been temporarily cancelled earlier that year after experts invited on to the programme failed to corroborate the official explanation for the death of Prime Minister Zurab Zhvania.http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=10305 ‚ÄòAuthorities accused as TV station takes talk-show off air‚Äô www.civil.ge, 7 July 2005 In 2008 it was announced that Mze would cease broadcasting news programmes due to a planned reorganization.http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=18619 Mze TV Suspends News, Civil Georgia, 26 June 2006 Commentary on Mze from Georgian and international watchdogs and the US Department of State In its 2005 Country Report (Georgia) on Human Rights Practices the US Department of State said that government pressure on the media had been reported. It noted Mze's cancellation of On the Edge of Choice and observed that the programme was often critical of the government. The cancellation, it said, ‚Äòoccurred shortly after an influential parliamentarian appeared on the show and criticized comments made by the program host.

It discussed the unexpected February cancellation of Mze's ‚Äòhighly rated‚Äô political talk show, ‚ÄòNight Mzera‚Äô hosted by Inga Grigolia. It disputed the claims of a Mze representative that the cancellation was temporary, saying that Grigolia had already quit the channel.

It was proposed by Barbara A. Carper, a professor at the College of Nursing at Texas Woman's University, in 1978.Melanie Jasper (2003), Beginning reflective practice. Nelson Thornes, ; pp. 93‚Äì95 The typology identifies four fundamental \\"patterns of knowing\\": ;Empirical: Factual knowledge from science, or other external sources, that can be empirically verified. ;Personal: Knowledge and attitudes derived from personal self-understanding and empathy, including imagining one's self in the patient's position. ;Ethical: Attitudes and knowledge derived from an ethical framework, including an awareness of moral questions and choices. ;Aesthetic: Awareness of the immediate situation, seated in immediate practical action; including awareness of the patient and their circumstances as uniquely individual, and of the combined wholeness of the situation. (Aesthetic in this sense is used to mean \\"relating to the here and now\\", from the Greek Œ±·º∞œÉŒ∏Œ¨ŒΩŒøŒºŒ±Œπ (aisthanomai), meaning \\"I perceive, feel, sense\\";Aesthetic, Online Etymology Dictionary the reference is not to the consideration of beauty, art and taste). The emphasis on different ways of knowing is presented as a tool for generating clearer and more complete thinking and learning about experiences, and broader self-integration of classroom education. As such it helped crystallize Johns' (1995) framework for reflective investigation to develop reflective practice. The typology has been seen as leading a reaction against over-emphasis on just empirically derived knowledge, so called \\"scientific nursing\\", by emphasising that attitudes and actions that are perhaps more personal and more intuitive are centrally important too, and equally fit for discussion.

It is the sequel to 2009's 'Splosion Man. The game takes place directly after Splosion Man. In the celebration of 'Splosion Man's capture the scientists accidentally create Ms. Splosion Man. The gameplay draws most of its core elements from its predecessor, but adds new gameplay mechanics such as jump pads and riding on rails. The game was generally very well received by critics. Aggregate websites GameRankings and Metacritic report scores in the 85% range. Individual scores ranged from a 60% approval to multiple perfect scores. Critics generally felt that the game was a great expansion and improvement over the original. The game's humor was also lauded. Criticisms included long load times between levels and increased difficulty over the original Splosion Man. The game sold over 70,000 units as of year-end 2011. On November 14, 2018, Ms. Splosion Man was announced for the Nintendo Switch, and released on November 22. Gameplay Ms. Splosion Man is the sequel to the 2009 video game 'Splosion Man. For the first time in the series the title character can venture outside the laboratory where they were created. Ms. Splosion Man shares much of the same gameplay with its predecessor, 'Splosion Man. The character is made entirely of explosive material. The aim of the game is to \\"splode\\" through a series of levels consisting of puzzles, traps, and enemies. A splode is effectively a jump, and can also be used to kill enemies, such as scientists and robots, demolish walls, detonate explosive barrels or trigger other effects. Various new gameplay elements have been added to Ms. Splosion Man, including energy rails on which the protagonist can ride, and cannons that toss her in specific directions, some of which can be controlled by the player. The game features both single-player and multiplayer cooperative campaigns, each including levels set in the outside world. Also new to the game is a mode known as 2 Girls 1 Controller, which enables a single player to play through the cooperative campaign controlling both Ms. Splosion Man and 'Splosion Man simultaneously. In response to player feedback about the first game's difficulty, Ms. Splosion Man contains an overworld that clearly marks each level's difficulty and allows players to skip more difficult levels if they so choose. Twisted Pixel CEO Micheal Wilford stated that the overworld map was inspired by Super Mario World, and that it contains similar secrets such as secret exits. Synopsis Following from where 'Splosion Man left off, 'Splosion Man is finally captured by Big Science. As the scientists celebrate in their lab, one scientist inadvertently spills a bottle of liquid onto some electrical wiring. This causes a surge of energy to flow to a nearby experimentation platform where a yellow bow is falling. As the bow touches the platform the surge of energy is released, and Ms. Splosion Man is created. For the first time in the series the character will escape the fictional Big Science facilities and venture out into the world. Development Ms. Splosion Man was announced December 3, 2010 via a press release and teaser trailer. \\"I think with Splosion Man a follow up was something we really wanted to do, and that is why you never saw DLC for that game. We could have churned out new levels, but we wouldn't have had the time to add in new gameplay puzzles or cool new character stuff. But we didn't just want to do Splosion Man 2, it had to be something a little more interesting. That is why we decided to do MSM,\\" stated Josh Bear of Twisted Pixel Games. The team chose a female variation on 'Splosion Man as an homage to Ms. Pac- Man, which, according to Bear, the game pays homage to. Bear continued by explaining that as Ms. Pac-Man was an improvement on Pac-Man so Ms. Splosion Man is meant to be an advancement on Splosion Man. He stated the goal was to ensure that the game \\"stands out on its own as a much bigger and better game overall, not to be confused as an over-priced DLC pack which I think a lot of retail \\"sequels\\" can be a lot of the time.\\" The game runs on Twisted Pixel's BEARD engine, which has been used to power all of their titles. Twisted Pixel stated that their desire was to keep the game character driven. CEO Micheal Wilford stated \\"Everything is character based. The thing that matters to us is that hopefully there's a memorable character that makes you laugh, cause no one makes games like that anymore. One of the ways in which they do this is with pop culture references. For example, if the controller is kept idle long enough Ms. Splosion Man will do the Macarena, a popular dance from the 1990s. Additionally the character will quote movies and other references as the player navigates through levels. Ms. Splosion Man ran a beta testing session in June 2011. Ten thousand signup slots opened to players on May 24, 2011. The beta slots filled in three days. Additional codes were distributed during E3 2011 on the show floor and via the official Twisted Pixel Games Twitter account as well as programmer Mike Henry's Twitter account. The game was shown at PAX East 2011 as well as E3 2011. The game was released on July 13, 2011, nearly two years after Splosion Man. On April 6, 2012, Twisted Pixel Games announced that Ms. Splosion Man is coming for Steam, Games for Windows ‚Äì Live, iOS and Windows Phone. Reception Ms. Splosion Man received generally strong reviews, some with critical acclaim. Aggregate scores were strong, with Metacritic reporting 82/100. GameRankings reports a similar aggregate score of 83.92%. Individual scores ranged from a 60% approval to a perfect score. The lowest score came from Giant Bomb's Brad Shoemaker who gave the game 3/5 stars. It sold over 70,000 units in its first calendar year. Multiple critics gave the game a perfect score, including Richard Mitchell of Joystiq, Ray Barnholt of 1UP.com, and Terry Terrones of GamePro. Richard Mitchell of Joystiq stated that Twisted Pixel Games put in a lot of love into this sequel that is packed with new mechanics, level designs and he stated it was his favorite ending of a video game. He stated that \\"Ms. Splosion Man. excels over its predecessor in every way.\\" Daemon Hatfield of IGN also gave the game high marks. He stated in the review that the game was \\"another excellent, thrilling platformer from the insane team at Twisted Pixel.\\" He added that the game was much more challenging than the first installment, but that it was also more creative, adding new gameplay elements and spots of humor. Hatfield said \\"there is more creativity packed into one Ms. Splosion Man level than many other games can muster in their entirety\\". 1UP.com's Ray Barnholt awarded the title an A rating and praised the single and multiplayer modes. Nick Chester of Destructoid called it a step up from Splosion Man. He noted that fans of the first will enjoy the game. \\"If you enjoyed the developer's first incendiary platformer, you've got no excuse not to go pink for Ms. Splosion Man.\\" Official Xbox Magazines Tyler Cocke praised the wonderful levels, excellent humor and charm but criticized the long load times between levels and menus. Terry Terrones of GamePro praised the vast amount of content for the asking price. He stated it had \\"a ton of great content to choose from, from concept art to videos and more.\\" GameSpot's Carolyn Petit lauded the game's level design and cooperative mode. She felt it had many funny moments and extras, as well as great replay value. She criticized some of the visuals and puzzles that hinder some moments. Brad Shoemaker from Giant Bomb expressed some disappointment in the game \\"Given all the improvements and additions and craziness, though, it's a little disappointing that I didn't enjoy playing this sequel as much as the first one.\\" His criticisms included the amount of time it takes for Ms. Splosion Man to reach her full speed, and the lack of air control. In addition, he felt the game required a certain amount of \\"guesswork\\" to get through some levels, and that players have been put off by the trial-and-error segments present within the game.

She posted a lifetime average of .227, including 489 hits, 37 triples and eight home runs while scoring 317 runs. Though mainly a singles hitter, she was a productive force at the plate, driving in 216 runs, averaging over 43 per season and produced a personal-best 55 RBI in 1943. The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL) was introduced in the spring of 1943, featuring young women with both athletic ability and feminine appeal. Hundreds of girls were eager to play in the new league, and 280 were invited to final tryouts at Wrigley Field in Chicago, Illinois. Of those, sixty were selected as the first women to play on the first four teams: the Kenosha Comets, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox. Each team had fifteen players, a manager, a business manager and a female chaperone. Most AAGPBL games were played at night, including the All-Star game of the inaugural season on July 1, 1943, which also was the first contest played under artificial illumination at Wrigley Field. The game was played between two teams composed of Belles and Comets players against Blue Sox and Peaches players.SABR Project ‚Äî Doris Sams biography by Jim Sargent Stefani entered the league in 1943 with the South Bend Blue Sox, playing for them five years before joining the Rockford Peaches (1948).

In the 19th century, the ceremony could last up to sixteen days (Padahaaru Rojula Panduga). In modern times, it can last two or more days, depending on the family's financial and social status. The wedding ceremonies depend on the caste of the bride and groom. The pelli or wedding is considered the strongest of social bonds, and is said to spiritually merge two souls opening the doors to gruhastaashramam (household life). There is a Telugu saying that \\"Marriage is supposed to be a family union and not an individual formality.\\" Telugu marriage is sanctified by seven pledges made by the bride and groom and begins when the bride and groom have completed seven revolutions around a sacred fire. Symbolic gestures and rituals surround the ceremony and ensure that the bride and groom are united in the presence of Panchabhutaalu ‚Äîfive essential elements for life, namely: Bhumi (earth), Akaasham (sky), Agni (fire), Neeru (water) and Vaayuvu (air). The ceremony is held under a Ka·∏∑yƒÅ·πáa Ma·πá·∏çapa·πÉ or wedding pavilion decorated with fresh flowers. The NƒÅdasvaram (also called the Shehnai in North India) is an Indian musical instrument that traditionally accompanies most Telugu weddings. Each element in the ceremony is connected and is given special importance. Historically, the groom would ride an elephant to the bride's home where the wedding is supposed to take place. This practice is called Gajaarohana. Today this tradition is declining. Some marriage ceremonies are held in a temple in the presence of god, but most are conducted outside because of the number of people in attendance. After every ceremony, they serve food to all the guests, which is also the main part of the culture of offering food to anyone who comes on an auspicious day. It is also a tradition to eat ice cream or sweets after dinner because it is considered auspicious. All the rituals conducted throughout the Telugu wedding ceremony hold religious significance. The decorations mostly consist of rich colourful flowers and mango leaves. Families renovate their houses and invite all the guests going to each of their houses by the use of kumkuma (colourful, decorative powder).  Pre- wedding customs  The rich and varied cultural heritage of Telugu speaking people is reflected in the ceremonies conducted there. Almost all festivals are celebrated with religious observances, holding supreme importance in the lives of the state's residents. ; Ni≈õchitƒÅrtham (‡∞®‡∞ø‡∞∂‡±ç‡∞ö‡∞ø‡∞§‡∞æ‡∞∞‡±ç‡∞•‡∞Ç) : Ni≈õchitƒÅrtham means engagement. The two families meet to perform rituals to make the engagement official. A muh≈´rta·πÉ (auspicious date & time) for the wedding is decided based on horoscopes. The Telugu people generally avoid the months or a time period where Aashaadham, Bhadrapadam and Shunya maasam occurs, because they are considered inauspicious for the ceremonies. The couple is then blessed by elders of both families, and is given gifts including jewelry and clothing by their new family. During this ceremony, the bride's future mother- in-law presents her with clothes, gold and also silverware, formally ending the engagement (Ni≈õchitƒÅrtham).http://oiss.rice.edu/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&ItemID;=854 ; SnƒÅtaka·πÉ (‡∞∏‡±ç‡∞®‡∞æ‡∞§‡∞ï‡∞Ç) :SnƒÅtaka·πÉ means \\"graduation\\" or \\"Bath Graduate\\" or \\"Post graduation\\". It is usually performed before householder responsibilities are handed over to the groom. SnƒÅtaka·πÉ ritual takes place at the bridegroom‚Äôs residence before the muh≈´rta·πÉ. As a part of this custom, the groom is asked to wear a silver thread on his body. The ritual is conducted a few hours prior to the wedding. ; KƒÅ≈õƒ´ YƒÅtra (‡∞ï‡∞æ‡∞∂‡±Ä ‡∞Ø‡∞æ‡∞§‡±ç‡∞∞) : Traditionally, after SnƒÅtaka·πÉ, the groom will be eligible for higher studies and eligible to go to Kashi and study further or become Sanyasi. However, as a pre-wedding ceremony, the groom pretends to go to Kashi and says that he has discarded the worldly pleasures (such as marriage, relations and properties) and is no longer interested in leading a family life. He will then be stopped by the brother (cousin) of the bride, who persuades him to assume the responsibility of a household.  Wedding customs  The rituals conducted by the Telugu speaking people during the ceremonious occasion of the wedding are different from those conducted in neighboring southern states of India. In Andhra Pradesh, the Telugu people follow their own traditions while conducting a wedding. The bride's maternal uncle and her brother play a prominent role at the time of her marriage. Unlike other South Indian weddings, the muh≈´rta·πÉ in Telugu weddings do not take place in the morning, but close to midnight. Telugu Brahmins' wedding customs differ from the wedding customs of the other Telugu communities. In addition to the rituals mentioned below, their weddings start with rituals common in South Indian Brahmin weddings like Punyahavachanam, Ni≈õchitƒÅrtham, Matrukapujanam, etc. ; Ma·πÖga·∏∑a SnƒÅna·πÉ (‡∞Æ‡∞ô‡±ç‡∞ó‡∞≥‡∞∏‡±ç‡∞®‡∞æ‡∞®‡∞Ç): As a part of Ma·πÖga·∏∑a SnƒÅna·πÉ custom, the bride and groom are required to take an auspicious bath on the wedding day. The aim is to purify them and make them prepared to perform sacred rites. This bath is called Abhyangana SnƒÅnam ; Bridal Makeup :In this ceremony at the bride and groom's respective houses, all the relatives and well-wishers gather and they smear them with turmeric paste (Nalugu - which is a mixture of flours and turmeric powder) and oils. This is done to cleanse their skin, so that it radiates a natural glow after they bathe. This is where the actual ceremony begins. They are given a new set of clothing to wear and are blessed that everything goes by well in the preparation. The bride is told not to go out of town until the actual wedding ceremony. ; Aarti or HƒÅrati (‡∞π‡∞æ‡∞∞‡∞§‡∞ø): Oil is applied to the bride and groom at their respective houses. Thereafter, the family members get together to perform Aarti. They pray for the bride and groom to be granted the wisdom to lead their lives happily. ; Ganƒì≈õa and Gauri P≈´ja (‡∞ó‡∞£‡±á‡∞∂ ‡∞™‡±Ç‡∞ú ; ‡∞ó‡±å‡∞∞‡±Ä ‡∞™‡±Ç‡∞ú): Before the wedding ceremony, the groom attends the Ganesha and Gowri pooja, which is conducted at the ma·πá·∏çapa·πÉ. And the bride does the Gauri P≈´ja at the house with all her family members and relatives attending before going to the ceremony. It is during this time that Pravara a ritual of changing the Bride's gotram (clan) from her paternal gotram to that of the Groom is performed. Elderly couples from both families are required to attend and witness the Pravara while the bride is performing Gauri P≈´ja. ; KanyƒÅdƒÅna·πÉ (‡∞ï‡∞®‡±ç‡∞Ø‡∞æ‡∞¶‡∞æ‡∞®‡∞Ç): KanyƒÅdƒÅna·πÉ is the ceremony in which the girl's family hands over their daughter's responsibility to the groom. During the ceremony, the bride sits in a bamboo basket. Her maternal uncle brings her to the ma·πá·∏çapa·πÉ. Until the completion of the KanyƒÅdƒÅna·πÉ, the bride and groom are not allowed to look at each other and are separated by a curtain that is placed between them, as a partition. Thereafter, the bride's parents wash the groom's feet, as a gesture of respect because on the day of wedding the bride groom is considered as \\"Lord Vishnu Svar≈´pa·πÉ\\" or the incarnation of lord Vishnu who has come to marry their daughter who is considered as \\"Devi Lakshmi\\". The groom is made to chant \\"Dharmƒìca Arthƒìca Kamƒìcha Mokshƒìca NƒÅti CarƒÅmi\\" three times and assure the bride's father three times that he will remain her companion in joy and sorrow forever. ; Pa·πáigraha·πáa·πÉ (‡∞™‡∞æ‡∞£‡∞ø‡∞ó‡±ç‡∞∞‡∞π‡∞£‡∞Ç): This means \\"holding hands\\". The groom holds the hand of the bride. The Mantras is spoken: \\"The Devas have offered you to me in order that I may live the life of a householder (Gruhasta); we shall not part from each other.\\" ; Jƒ´lakarra Bella·πÉ and Madhuparka·πÉ (‡∞ú‡±Ä‡∞≤‡∞ï‡∞∞‡±ç‡∞∞‡∞æ‡∞¨‡±Ü‡∞≤‡±ç‡∞≤‡∞Ç ; ‡∞Æ‡∞ß‡±Å‡∞™‡∞∞‡±ç‡∞ï‡∞Ç): The priest recites the ≈õloka·πÉs from the Vedas. Then the couple is asked to place a paste made from cumin seeds and jaggery on each other‚Äôs head. This custom is referred to as Jƒ´lakarra-Bellamu. This ceremony is observed to communicate that the married couple's relationship is unbreakable and they are inseparable. This is the actual muh≈´rta·πÉ time. The ritual (Pravara) of changing bride's gotram is once performed again on the marriage dais in the presence of the groom and everyone attending the ceremony. Henceforth, the bride no longer belongs to the father's gotra, but now belongs to the groom's. As a part ofMadhuparka·πÉ ritual, the bride dresses up in a white sari with a red border. The groom wears a white dhoti with a red border. White symbolizes purity and red represents strength. ;Sumanga·∏∑i (‡∞∏‡±Å‡∞Æ‡∞Ç‡∞ó‡∞≥‡∞ø): Ten married women (Sumanga·∏∑i) accompany the bride. Six of the ten women hold plates containing sacred rice (a mixture of rice and turmeric powder), while the rest of them hold small lit lamps on their respective plates. Rice represents abundance, while the lit lamps symbolize light. ;Ma·πÖga·∏∑as≈´tra DhƒÅra·πáa Ma·πÖga·∏∑as≈´tra DhƒÅra·πáa means tying Ma·πÖga·∏∑as≈´tra·πÉ (holy thread). In order to perform the ritual, the partition between the bride and groom is removed. Then the groom ties the two strings of Ma·πÖga·∏∑as≈´tra·πÉ, each with a golden disc, around the bride's neck. The Ma·πÖga·∏∑as≈´tra·πÉ represents the physical, mental and spiritual union of the couple. In the Telugu wedding, the groom ties three knots of Ma·πÖga·∏∑as≈´tra·πÉ. ;Akshitalu (‡∞Ö‡∞ï‡±ç‡∞∑‡∞ø‡∞Ç‡∞§‡∞≤‡±Å): In the Akshitalu or Tala·πÉbrƒÅlu ceremony, the bride and groom exchange garlands. Married people witnessing this occasion come forward to bless the couple, by sprinkling flower petals and rice coated with turmeric powder. ;Saptapadi (‡∞∏‡∞™‡±ç‡∞§‡∞™‡∞¶‡∞ø): As a part of the Saptapadi rituals, the groom and bride walk seven steps together around the fire, while taking their oaths of caring, protecting, understanding, loving and guiding each other. Only in a Telugu Brahmin marriage the pallu (edge of the sari) of the bride's sari is tied to one end of the groom's scarf (Kan·∏çuva). ;SthƒÅlƒ´pƒÅka·πÉ (‡∞∏‡±ç‡∞•‡∞æ‡∞≤‡±Ä‡∞™‡∞æ‡∞ï‡∞Ç): SthƒÅlƒ´pƒÅka·πÉ is a ritual where in the groom adorns the feet of the bride with silver toe rings. It is also believed that the man bends to the woman in order to claim her as his. Also in order to ward-off the evil eye, the bride is adorned by a string of black beads during the ceremony. These beads, along with the silver toe rings, symbolize that she is a married woman. After this, a kun·∏ça (decorated silver or terra-cotta vessel) full of water is placed in front of the couple, and a ring is put in it. The groom puts his right hand in and the bride puts her left hand in and they fish for the ring. They do this three times and whoever wins more often is supposed to be the dominant one in the marriage. This is a time of fun, because water splashes everywhere and there are chants and shouts of support for both sides. Also, the bride is made to cook (a namesake meal) on the sacred flame of the Agnih≈çtra·πÉ, symbolizing she is now responsible for taking care of the health of her husband and family. ;Arundhati Nakshatram (‡∞Ö‡∞∞‡±Å‡∞Ç‡∞ß‡∞§‡∞ø ‡∞®‡∞ï‡±ç‡∞∑‡∞§‡±ç‡∞∞‡∞Ç):Arundhati Nakshatram is a ritual where bride and groom are shown the stars representing Arundhati and Vasistha. These stars represent the perfect couple complementing each other. Mizar and Alcor are two stars forming a double star that can be seen with the naked eye in the handle of the Big Dipper (or the Plough) asterism in the constellation of Ursa Major. Mizar is the second star from the end of the Big Dipper's handle, and Alcor its faint companion. Alcor is recognized as Arundhadi. ;Appagintalu (‡∞Ö‡∞™‡±ç‡∞™‡∞ó‡∞ø‡∞Ç‡∞§‡∞≤‡±Å): Appagintalu takes place at the end of the wedding. This is when the bride is traditionally handed off to the groom and his family. Post-wedding customs ; GrÃ•uhapravƒì≈õam (‡∞ó‡±É‡∞π‡∞™‡±ç‡∞∞‡∞µ‡±á‡∞∂‡∞Ç) :After the culmination of the wedding ceremony, the bride is formally taken to the groom‚Äôs house. This is called GrÃ•hapravƒì≈õam of the bride. As she steps into her new home, she is welcomed by the groom‚Äôs family members, including his mother and closest relatives. The uniting of Ma·πÖga·∏∑as≈´tra·πÉ takes place after a fortnight. :In karanam caste, the consummation takes place depending on tidhi, usually after a gap of one day. Havan puja is performed before the time fixed for physical consummation of the marriage. ; SatyanƒÅrƒÅya·πáa Vratam (‡∞∏‡∞§‡±ç‡∞Ø‡∞®‡∞æ‡∞∞‡∞æ‡∞Ø‡∞£ ‡∞µ‡±ç‡∞∞‡∞§‡∞Ç) : Satyam means \\"truth\\" and Narayana means \\"the highest being\\" so SatyanƒÅrƒÅya·πáa means \\"The highest being who is an embodiment of Truth\\". The SatyanƒÅrƒÅya·πáa Vratam is very popular in Andhra Pradesh India. SatyanƒÅrƒÅya·πáa Vratam is performed by bride and groom after GrÃ•hapravƒì≈õam in the groom's residence. This p≈´ja (ritual) is first mentioned in the Skanda Purana, Reva Kan·∏ça by S≈´ta MahƒÅmuni to the rÃ•shis in the Naimishara·πáya (ancient forest). The details are part of the Katha (\\"story\\") that is usually read after the p≈´ja. The SatyanƒÅrƒÅya·πáa p≈´ja/vratam can be performed on any day except on the new moon. ;Uniting the Ma·πÖga·∏∑as≈´tra·πÉ :GrÃ•uhapravƒì≈õam is followed by a ceremony, wherein the Ma·πÖga·∏∑as≈´tra·πÉ is united. As a customary, the Telugu speaking people unite the two Ma·πÖga·∏∑as≈´tra·πÉs (which was tied by the groom around the bride‚Äôs neck), on a common thread. This ritual is done sixteen days after the wedding. This ritual can be performed by either the groom or an elderly member of the family. A few black or golden beads are slipped between the two 'plates' of the Ma·πÖga·∏∑as≈´tra·πÉ, so that they do not clash with each other. The unison of Ma·πÖga·∏∑as≈´tra·πÉ signifies the harmony between the two families. After the ceremony is over, the bride takes a bath and wears a new sari.

Foundation The Diet of Torda (1557) established three schools in the former monasteries of Kolozsv√°r (Cluj-Napoca), Marosv√°s√°rhely (T√¢rgu Mure≈ü) and Nagyv√°rad (Oradea). Queen Isabella, regent for the infant John Sigismund, granted the school in Kolozsv√°r the annual sum of 100 forints. The then Lutheran Ferenc D√°vid was appointed rector but shortly afterwards he converted to Calvinism (1564‚Äì1567) and then Anti‚Äìtrinitarianism, and from 1568 Unitarianism. His son-in-law Johann Sommer was moderator of the Academy. In the next generation Gy√∂rgy Enyedi was moderator of the Academy. Habsburg Rule When Transylvania fell under Habsburg rule the Diploma Leopoldinum (1690) granted the rights of all four Christian denominations,(Which ones? This should be more specific.) and a process of re-catholisation followed. The building which had been used 1557‚Äì1693 for the Unitarian High School was returned to the Jesuits. The school moved to four buildings on the Town Square, nearby St. Michael‚Äôs Church which remained in Unitarian hands. However on 6 May 1697 most of Cluj-Napoca was destroyed in major fire - including the School. The school's rector was sent to the Netherlands to raise funds from Unitarian and Arminian supporters. Following the defeat of Francis II R√°k√≥czi, the Catholic church finally regained possession of St. Michael‚Äôs Church, and in 1718 the recently rebuilt school buildings on the square. The school relocated to what is today 21 December St. Andrzej Wiszowaty Jr., great-great grandson of Fausto Sozzini, taught at the college 1726-1740, during the period in the 1730s when the Unitarian Church was reorganized and strengthened by Mih√°ly Lombard de Szent√°brah√°m. 19th century The school was rebuilt in baroque style in 1801, home today to the Healthcare School. A second house was added in 1887, giving the school 55 rooms. From 1850 the school had an average of 400 students, 200 of whom lodged in the dormitories, and 25 professors. Prominent Hungarian-speaking Unitarian alumni of the 19th century included S√°muel Brassai, poets Mih√°ly Szentiv√°ni and J√°nos Kriza, historians Elek Jakab and L√°szl√≥ K≈ëv√°ri, chemist √Åron Berde and the writer Domokos Gyallai. Modern history The present building next to the Unitarian Church, constructed in 1901, is the largest school building in Cluj-Napoca. Between 1950‚Äì1993 the school was renamed as the S√°muel Brassai School. In 1993 it was reopened and renamed in 2003 after John II Sigismund Z√°polya, the first prince of the Principality of Transylvania.

In November 2013, following a cabinet reshuffle by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Kluzik-Rostkowska was appointed to head the Ministry of National Education. Early life Joanna Kluzik-Rostkowska was born on 14 December 1963 in Katowice, Poland. She graduated from the University of Warsaw with an M.A. in Journalism and Political Science. In 1989, she joined Tygodnik Solidarno≈õƒá, becoming a member of the paper's political section before moving on to Express Wieczorny, becoming editor of the newspaper and garnering the attention of Lech Kaczy≈Ñski, who was then chief of the Presidential Chancellery. In 1996, Kluzik-Rostkowska joined the ranks of Wprost, becoming a political correspondent. She would later join the journal Nowe Pa≈Ñstwo in 2000, followed by the ladies weekly Przyjaci√≥≈Çka between 2001 and 2004.

It was opened in 1965 and was known as Cowley Centre until 1989. It is the largest enclosed shopping centre in Oxford. Development and construction A shopping centre in central Cowley was first proposed in the late 1950s. By 1959, the proposal had received strong endorsement from Oxford City Council, and an embargo on new shopping developments along the nearby Cowley Road was enforced. The development was opposed by William Beveridge, who felt that Cowley was the wrong location for the centre. Construction of the development, by now known as Cowley Centre, began in 1960. Its design was inspired by new town centres and North American shopping malls. The shopping centre designed by the Oxford City Architects E. G. Chandler and Douglas Murray. Between Towns Road was realigned when Cowley Centre was built. Opening and subsequent history Cowley Centre was opened in May 1965 by Richard Crossman, then Minister of Housing and Local Government. The opening ceremony was attended by over 300 people. In 1970, the Sainsbury's store at the northern end of the centre was extended, requiring the demolition of a local pub, which was rebuilt around twenty yards away. The Sainsbury's store later closed and was replaced by branches of Wilkinson and Iceland. The centre was renamed to Templars Square in 1989, and celebrated its 20th year under the name with a series of events in August 2009. In January 2014 part of the centre's glass roof was damaged in a storm.Oxford's Templars Square shopping centre glass roof smashes BBC News, 26 January 2014 Facilities As of August 2009, Templars Square has 63 retailers, making it the largest shopping centre in Oxford. This number had decreased from 85 in 2002, partly because of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010; one of the largest stores, Woolworth's, closed in December 2009. However, overall trade at the centre was largely unaffected by the recession. The Woolworth's site has since been taken over by 99p Stores. As of June 2010, the centre's occupancy rate is 96%. Templars Square has a six-storey car park. This opened in 1964, a year before the shopping centre. In July 2009 the top deck of the car park was temporarily closed after three people died by falling from it. The centre is located adjacent to the Templars Retail Park, which was legally restricted to non-food sales to avoid competition with the centre. In December 2010 a proposal was announced to relax the restriction and open a new supermarket at the site, which was opposed by the centre's management. This has since changed with a Sainsbury's superstore opening in this retail park.  Future development  In 2012 New River bought the centre and soon revealed redevelopment plans. Plans for redevelopment of the centre including 200 homes, shops, two restaurants and a hotel received planning permission in July 2017 however, as of October 2020 no redevelopment has taken place and there is currently no scheduled start date for this.

Opened in 1851, the station forms part of the Venice‚ÄìUdine railway, and is also a junction of three branch lines, to Montebelluna (and from there to Belluno and Calalzo along the Calalzo-Padova railway), Vicenza and Portogruaro, respectively. Although Treviso Centrale is currently the only railway station in Treviso, it is so named to distinguish it from the two other railway facilities within the comune boundaries: Treviso Porta Santi Quaranta (a goods yard) and the marshalling yard at Treviso Scalo Motta (i.e. Treviso Scalo junction to Motta). Treviso Centrale is currently owned by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). The commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services to and from the station are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Features Services inside the station include ticketing, a waiting area, shops, offices, and the headquarters of the Railway Police. Eight tracks run through the station. As they are all equipped with platforms, they can all be used for passenger service. The platforms are connected by two subways. One of them connects the historic district of San Zeno, the platforms and the passenger building, and ends on the other side of the ring road opposite the passenger building. The other subway, to the west of the first one, connects the platforms with the parking station. Treviso Centrale is also equipped with a locomotive shed and some stabling facilities for passenger rolling stock that is not in use. There are two goods yards. One is located just beyond the station towards Udine (Treviso Scalo Motta), without crossing loops but with various sidings and a small office building. The second yard re-uses the freight yard and the warehouse of the former Treviso Porta Santi Quaranta railway station (now incorporated into Treviso Centrale). Although the goods service is rather modest compared to the past, it is still in operation. Rail traffic at the station is handled with an ACEI type control console with tabulation of train paths and routes. Train services The station is served by the following services: *High speed services (Frecciargento) Udine - Treviso - Venice - Padua - Bologna - Florence - Rome *High speed services (Frecciabianca) Udine - Treviso - Venice - Padua - Verona - Milan *High speed services (Frecciabianca) Udine - Treviso - Vicenza - Verona - Milan *Intercity services (EuroCity) Vienna - Klagenfurt - Villach - Udine - Treviso - Venice *Night train (CityNightLine) Munich - Tarvisio - Udine - Treviso - Venice *Night train (EuroNight) Vienna - Linz - Salzburg - Villach - Udine - Treviso - Venice *Night train (Intercity Notte) Trieste - Udine - Venice - Padua - Bologna - Rome *Express services (Regionale Veloce) Trieste - Gorizia - Udine - Treviso - Venice *Regional services (Treno regionale) Trieste - Gorizia - Udine - Treviso - Venice *Regional services (Treno regionale) Vicenza - Citadella - Castelfranco Veneto - Treviso *Regional services (Treno regionale) Padua - Castelfranco Veneto - Treviso *Local services (Treno regionale) Treviso - Portogruaro *Local services (Treno regionale) (Belluno -) Montebelluna - Treviso Passenger and train movements All trains transiting through Treviso Centrale stop there, on their way to various parts of Italy. The main destinations are Venice, Trieste, Udine, Vicenza, Portogruaro and Milan. There are a few trains in international service to Austria or Germany. With about 7 million passenger movements each year, Treviso Centrale is one of the busiest in the Veneto in terms of passenger movements.

The valley is in the east of the New Mexico Bootheel region and borders Chihuahua state, Mexico. Hachita, New Mexico lies in the valley's northeast, where New Mexico State Road 9 traverses east-west across much of southern New Mexico. The large, and extensive north-south Playas Valley borders to the west on the other side of the west perimeter mountain ranges. The Hachita Valley lies in the northwest of the Chihuahuan Desert, with the southeast of the valley draining southeast into desert regions of northern Chihuahua. The Hachita Valley is created because of the three surrounding mountainous regions; the north is more bajada-like, and extends north to foothills of higher elevation mountain regions, transitioning to the Continental Divide of the Americas. The valley is located in Hidalgo County, but the extreme north drains from north of Hachita in south Grant County. Description Hachita Valley is a north-south valley in its north region of about 20 miNew Mexico Atlas & Gazetteer, DeLorme, c. 2009, p. 52-53. in length; the south turns abruptly southeastwards for 15 mi to exit into the Chihuahuan Desert lower elevations in northern Chihuahua. The Apache Hills are the large section of the hills in the east and northeast causing the valley's curvature. A major central wash follows the valley's southeast; the north has no major wash, and instead drainages are towards a central bajada landform region. The northern bajada extends north past Hachita, NM on the east and Old Hachita, NM on the west. The southeasterly excursion of the valley is caused by the bordering Big Hatchet Mountains on the southwest, which trend southeast; the valley narrows here, between the Apache Hills northeast, to between 5 and 7 miNew Mexico Atlas & Gazetteer, p. 52-53. wide. In the northwest where the valley widens, the Little Hatchet Mountains lie on the west perimeter. The site of Old Hachita is on the Little Burro's northeast; Playas, NM lies on the northwest. Twelvemile Wells is near the valley's center, and is just north of where the southeast valley excursion starts, near the beginning of the southeast washes. In the northeast of the Big Hatchet Mountains, bordering the southwest valley lies the Big Hatchet Mountains Wilderness Study Area. Access New Mexico State Road 81 traverses the north section of the valley from Hachita, and goes southwest to the Playas Valley through Hachita Gap, between the Little and Big Hatchet Mountains.

Life Pollert's talen was discovered by his brother, who in his adulthood financed his singing lessons with Francis Pivoda and Moritz Wallerstein. His study did not last long; he was engaged in Olomouc in the season 1898‚Äì1899, following which he was recommended to the National Theatre and immediately accepted. Pollert's voice was strong and granular, extremely resonant, with an extraordinary range, its color gradually cultivated into a soft and velvety tone. He was regarded as particularly suited to comedic roles, which he played realistically, with a tendency to naturalism.Deyl, cit. d.; N√°rodn√≠ divadlo a jeho p≈ôedch≈Ødci, s. 385 aj. His debut was in the dramatic opera Byl jednou jeden kr√°l. Following this, successful performances followed in such operas as Dalibor, Tannh√§user, Rusalka and The Bartered Bride. He gradually gained fame for his performance in comic roles.Kopeck√Ω, Posp√≠≈°il, cit. d., s. 106 After the retirement of prominent bassist Vaclav Kliment, Pollert took his place at the center of the stage, representing a total of 221 roles in more than 5,000 performances.ƒåeskoslovensk√Ω hudebn√≠ slovn√≠k Besides performing in operatic roles, he was involved in the production of several ballets and starred in the comic operetta, The Mikado. He directed 12 operas himself. He founded and led an organization for soloists of the National Theatre, and from 1920 to 1922, was director of opera and theater at the ≈†vandovo Arena in Prague. In 1927, he was awarded the State Prize for excellent work in the National Theatre. Pollert died in Prague of a heart attack in 1935 just before his scheduled appearance in the role of Boniface in Bed≈ôich Smetana's The Secret. He is buried at the Vinohrady cemetery. The National Theatre features a bust of Pollert, created by sculptor Charles Dvorak. Notable performances He focused particularly on roles by Czech composers, particularly those by Smetana. He sang Kecal in The Bartered Bride in Warsaw, Bucharest, Vienna and many places in Bohemia. He developed the character in detail, not only singing but acting, with special emphasis on gesture, facial expressions and body positioning. Critics praised both his forceful comic and accurate vocal performance.Kopeck√Ω, Posp√≠≈°il, cit. d., s. 107 He performed this role at the anniversary of the opera at the National Theatre. His performance as Kecal was recorded in 1933 (where he was conducted by Otakar Ostrcil) and preserved twice on film: in a silent version of 1913 (directed by Max Urban) and one with sound of 1933 (film director, Svatopluk Innemann; theater director, Jaroslav Kvapil).

The Monitor was launched in December 2010 in London and Cancun to coincide with the UN Cancun Summit on climate change (COP-16). Developed by DARA and the Climate Vulnerable Forum, the report is meant to serve as a new tool to assess global vulnerability to various effects of climate change within different nations. The report distills leading science and research for a clearer explanation of how and where populations are being affected by climate change today (2010) and in the near future (2030), while pointing to key actions that reduce these impacts. DARA and the Climate Vulnerable Forum launched the 2nd edition of the Climate Vulnerability Monitor on 26 September 2012 at the Asia Society, New York. Objectives The Climate Vulnerability Monitor attempts to demonstrate how each country is vulnerable to climate change (due to health reasons, extreme weather patterns, economic factors, land loss from expanding deserts or rising sea levels). It lists over 50 measures that the authors claim are readily available to limit virtually all harm caused by climate change. Approach The Climate Vulnerability Monitor reportedly takes a new approach to assessing the climate vulnerability of the world and its regions, countries and communities. The Monitor looks at pre-existing characteristics of society that are affected by climate change and maps the level of vulnerability and expected impact as implied by the effect that real or projected changes in the climate. The analysis is built around 4 \\"impact areas\\", and 5 \\"levels of vulnerability\\", focusing on the years 2010 and 2030. According to the report, the estimated figures of impacts are yielded from the Monitor‚Äôs specific methodology and represent additional impacts due to climate change. They give a \\"snapshot\\" of what is expected to already be taking place and what might occur in the near future. According to the authors, the Monitor represents just one possible way of measuring climate vulnerability that they expect can be improved upon. 4 Climate Impact Areas Addressed *Health Impact - additional mortality from climate-sensitive diseases *Weather Disasters - additional mortality and damage in storms, floods and wildfires *Habitat Loss - additional loss of human habitat to rising sea levels, desertification *Economic Stress - extra losses in the primary/agricultural sectors of the economy and key natural resources 5 Climate Vulnerability Factors *Acute (most vulnerable category) *Severe *High *Moderate *Low (least vulnerable category) Findings  Climate Vulnerability Monitor 2010 Mohamed Nasheed, President of the Maldives, at the presentation of the Climate Vulnerability Monitor in London, December 3, 2010 The report claims that climate change fuelled by human activities is already interfering with the climate, leading to effects that are dangerous for people and the planet. According to the report, the rate of change and effects of heat, wind, rain, deserts, sea level, and other impacts result in 350,000 deaths per year. The report states that the effects of climate change could contribute to the deaths of 5 million people by 2020 and cause as many as 1 million deaths per year by 2030 if global warming isn't slowed. Heat, wind, and water shortages put pressure on the habitat of approximately 2.5 million people. Storms, floods, and wildfires are estimated to leave an additional $5 billion in damage each year, while rising seas cost 1% of GDP to the lowest-income countries ‚Äì 4% in the Pacific ‚Äì with 65 billion dollars annually lost from the world economy. The report further states that most impacts are highly concentrated on children and the poor with the majority of the death toll is concentrated on children living in Sub-Saharan Africa or South Asia, and that gradual, not sudden, impacts from climate change causes more than 90% of all damage. Over 80% of people at risk from climate-caused desertification reside in high-growth emerging economies such as China and India. The report also states that half of the economic impacts of climate change are felt in industrialized countries. However, developing countries suffer much greater relative stresses to their economies, mainly due to larger, less robust agricultural sectors. Just 15 countries are considered acutely vulnerable to climate change today, collectively suffering nearly half of all climate impacts. Recognized fragile states or failed states like Afghanistan, Haiti, Myanmar, Sierra Leone, and Somalia are among the worst affected. An average of just 24 countries are assessed as having the most severe factor of vulnerability for each main impact area of health, extreme weather, habitat loss, and economic stress. In every case, some two thirds of the total global impact falls on just 10 countries. The report states that 20 more years of inaction could lead to nearly 1 million climate- related deaths each year by 2030. The number of acutely vulnerable countries could more than triple over that period. Economic costs could increase to $100 billion of stress on the world‚Äôs coastlines, $150 billion worth of primary- sector and natural resource losses, and $10 billion in storm, flood, and wildfire damages‚Äîa third of a trillion dollar annual economic crisis. History DARA and the Climate Vulnerable Forum created the Climate Vulnerability Monitor to advance understanding of the growing negative effects of climate change on society and to identify a variety of key options to meet this new challenge. The Climate Vulnerable Forum is a global partnership of leaders of countries most vulnerable to climate change actively seeking a firm and urgent resolution to the growing climate crisis. It was founded by President Mohamed Nasheed of the Maldives and first met in November 2009. The Declaration of the Climate Vulnerable Forum adopted then expressed alarm at the rate of changes and danger witnessed around the planet due to the effects of anthropogenic global warming and called for urgent international cooperation to tackle the challenge. The countries include Bangladesh, Barbados, Bhutan, Kiribati, Ghana, Kenya, Nepal, Rwanda, Tanzania, Vietnam and Maldives. DARA is an international organization based in Madrid, Spain, and founded in 2003 by Silvia Hidalgo. According to its website, the organization aims to improve the quality and effectiveness of aid for vulnerable populations suffering from conflict, disasters, and climate change.

Originally published in Italian as Regola delli cinque ordini d'architettura, it has been fully or partially translated in English with different titles, including Canon of the Five Orders of Architecture; Rules of the Five Orders of Architecture; Vignola: an elementary treatise on architecture comprising the complete study of the five orders, with indication of their shadows and the first principles of construction; The Five Orders of Architecture according to Giacomo Barozzio of Vignola, to Which are Added the Greek Orders; and The five orders of architecture, the casting of shadows and the first principles of construction based on the system of Vignola. Contents The book tackles the five orders, Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and composite in separate sections, each subdivided in five parts on the colonnade, arcade, arcade with pedestal, individual pedestals, and entablatures and capitals. Following those 25 sections were some less related parts on cornices and other elements. Written during the 1550s, it was published in 1562, and was soon considered the most practical work for the application of the five orders. Apart from the introduction, the book existed solely of 32 annotated plates, with views from the Pantheon illustrating the Corinthian order and the Theatre of Marcellus for the Doric order. Later editions had more illustrations. Author Vignola was an Italian Renaissance architect, assisting Michelangelo during his work on the St. Peter's Basilica. He was one of the architects of the Palazzo Farnese and the Church of the Gesu. Following the examples of the Classical Roman work of Vitruvius and the five books of the by Sebastiano Serlio published from 1537, Vignola started writing an architecture rule book on the classical orders. His work was more practical than the preceding two books which were more philosophical in nature. Editions and translations For centuries it has been reprinted, translated, and used as an inspiration, e.g. for William Robert Ware's main work The American Vignola of 1904. By 1700, it had been reprinted fifteen times in Italian, and translated into Dutch, English, French, German, Russian and Spanish. By the end of the twentieth century, more than 250 editions of the book had been published, making it \\"the most widely used architectural textbook of all up to the nineteenth century [...] forming one of the universal bases of courses of architecture\\".

In Fiscal Year 2010, Gwinnett Medical Center cared for approximately 400,000 inpatients, outpatients, emergency patients, and newborns. GMC has more than 4,200 employees and has a medical staff of 800 affiliated physicians. In August 2019, Northside Hospital and the Gwinnett Health System merged. Gwinnett Medical Center is now a part of the Northside Hospital system. History Joan Glancy Memorial Hospital Olin Burnette was six years old when he died in 1941. He was one of six children of a dairyman who worked for Dick Hull, manager of the Irvindale Farms Dairy just outside Duluth, Georgia. Hull was married to Nora, daughter of General and Mrs. A.R. Glancy. Devastated by Olin's death, the Hulls began a community campaign to establish a clinic in Duluth, which had no physician. The townspeople, mostly cotton farmers, contributed $450 toward the clinic. Nora was so touched by their effort that she wrote a letter to her parents about the campaign. The Glancys, who lived in Pontiac, Michigan, knew the pain of losing a child. Only 17 years earlier, their youngest daughter, Joan, had died of pneumonia at age 4. Nora's letter touched their hearts, so they sent a check for $500, with the promise that every year, on Joan's birthday, they‚Äôd send another check in her memory. Heard Summerour, the town postmaster, inspired an epiphany in the Glancys when he asked if they could name the new clinic The Joan Glancy Memorial Clinic. The Glancys realized that this little clinic‚Äîin a hardscrabble hamlet in Georgia‚Äîwas the perfect way to create a living memorial to their daughter that would serve many families for years to come. The Joan Glancy Memorial Clinic opened in 1941 in a three-room frame cottage on the school grounds. From the first day, the clinic was inundated with patients, so General Glancy issued a challenge to the people of Duluth: Provide land and a well, and he would build them a hospital. In 1944, the Joan Glancy Memorial Hospital opened. Button Gwinnett Hospital When county leaders established the Hospital Authority of Gwinnett County in 1957, the county's population had grown to about 30,000, but there were only 44 hospital beds available‚Äî27 at Joan Glancy Memorial Hospital and 17 at Hutchins Memorial Hospital, which opened in Buford in 1948. The newly chartered Authority devised a plan to build a hospital system consisting of three hospitals of 70 to 75 beds each and one large, central hospital with 200 beds. The Authority's first facility, Button Gwinnett Hospital, was constructed under a grant by the federal Hill-Burton Act. The hospital, which was located on the former county prison camp site on Scenic Highway in Lawrenceville, Georgia, began operations in 1959 with 35 beds and was expanded to 74 beds in 1966. Buford General Hospital In 1966, Gwinnett Hospital System's capacity increased again with the completion of the 40-bed Buford General Hospital. Shortly after Buford General opened, Hutchins Memorial closed after 18 years of service. Gwinnett Medical Center-Lawrenceville With a three-hospital system in place, the Hospital Authority watched as each facility quickly reached and exceeded capacity. The steady stream of new residents into Gwinnett County created a significant need for new hospital capacity. Expansion at all three hospitals was the only way to stay in line with the constantly increasing demand, so the Authority members set in motion a wave of renovation and expansion that continues today. By early 1969, Authority members and hospital leaders made a strong push for the central hospital, but the plans were put on hold in the mid 1970s, when President Richard Nixon vetoed the Medical Construction and Modernization Act, cutting off the federal hospital construction funding. When the funding resumed again in 1976, the Authority gave a unanimous go-ahead for construction of a $30 million, 250-bed central hospital in Gwinnett County. After several architectural designs and challenges with funding and site location, the reconfigured, 190-bed Gwinnett Medical Center (now Northside Hospital Gwinnett) opened in 1984, offering all general, medical, surgical and diagnostic services and 24-hour emergency room coverage. Button Gwinnett Hospital continued operation until the opening of the Gwinnett Medical Center in December 1984. SummitRidge In 1983, Buford General was converted to an alcohol and drug rehabilitation facility. These services were transferred to the newly opened SummitRidge facility in 1993. SummitRidge, located in Lawrenceville, opened as a 76-bed behavioral health inpatient facility in the former building that housed Button Gwinnett Hospital. In 2008, SummitRidge was sold by Gwinnett Hospital System. SummitRidge continues to provide behavioral health inpatient services to Gwinnett and the surrounding communities under ownership unrelated to the Gwinnett Hospital System or the Hospital Authority of Gwinnett County. Gwinnett Women's Pavilion In 1991, the Gwinnett Women's Pavilion was opened to provide maternity and newborn services. It was the first hospital for women in the metro Atlanta area. The building houses a labor and delivery suite, mother/baby unit, high-risk pregnancy unit, and a Level III neonatal intensive care unit. Gwinnett Extended Care Center In 1997, the Gwinnett Extended Care Center (GECC) opened. The GECC provides care for patients that are well enough to no longer need inpatient hospital care, but not well enough to return to independent living or traditional nursing home care. Gwinnett Medical Center-Duluth Northside Hospital Duluth In 2006, Joan Glancy Memorial Hospital's replacement facility opened as Gwinnett Medical Center- Duluth (now Northside Hospital Duluth). The new 111-bed facility transferred most acute care and emergency services to the new location on Pleasant Hill Road within close proximity of the Joan Glancy property. The facility which formerly housed Joan Glancy Memorial Hospital continues to operate as a 30-bed inpatient physical rehabilitation program with additional services that include diabetes & nutrition education and a sleep lab. This location has been renamed the Northside Gwinnett Joan Glancy Campus. Famous patients Larry Flynt was initially stabilized and treated at Button Gwinnett Hospital after he was shot in downtown Lawrenceville during a trial.Time magazine- \\"Nation: The Bloody Fall of a Hustler\\" Movies Two Hollywood productions were filmed at Gwinnett Medical Center facilities.

At , it is the city's fourth largest building in terms of floor area . It was the largest building until 1963 when the MetLife Building opened. The World Trade Center (which opened in 1970‚Äì71) and 55 Water Street , which opened in 1972, were also larger but the World Trade Center was destroyed in 2001. When the One World Trade Center opened in 2014, 111 became the city's fourth largest building. The building, which has been owned by Google since 2010, is one of the largest technology-owned office buildings in the world. It is also larger than Apple Park, Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California. Port Authority Commerce Building/Union Inland Terminal #1 The building was designed by Lusby Simpson of Abbott, Merkt & Co. and completed in 1932., p. 183. The building had a multipurpose design when it opened in 1932 with the first floor and basement designated as \\"Union Inland Terminal #1\\" which was to be used to transport goods by truck to and from railroad lines and/or shipping piers. The building included four freight elevators that could carry fully loaded 20 ton trucks. The second floor was the Commerce section designed for exhibitions and the upper floors were designed for manufacturing. The Union Inland Terminal was built by the Port Authority to be a warehouse/union station to handle less- than-carload (LCL) shipments, consolidating the shipping functions of the Hudson River piers two blocks west of the building, the eight trunk railroads that operated a block west of the building and truck operations (an inland terminal by definition is a warehouse that is not immediately next to railroad lines/piers but is nearby and is used to relieve congestion at the transfer points). At its peak in the 1930s the Port Authority said it was handling more than half of the LCL freight operations south of 59th Street in Manhattan with more than 8,000 tons of goods passing through it each month. On one day alone in 1937 it was reported that 650 trucks had used the facility. The railroads involved were the Pennsylvania Railroad; Lehigh Valley Railroad; Baltimore & Ohio; Erie Railroad; Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad; Central Railroad of New Jersey; New York Central Railroad; New York, New Haven & Hartford. Because of the warehouse mission of the building it was able to avoid some of the setback rules that greatly reduced the buildable space available for the skyscrapers that mark the Manhattan skyline. As a result, the 15-story building with most of its floors larger than the size of two football fields has more available rentable square footage than the 102-story Empire State Building which has . The construction occurred at a time of a massive projects built to deal with what at the time was street level freight railroad traffic on Manhattan's west side. Other projects in the neighborhood in the era included construction of the High Line and Starrett-Lehigh Building. Port Authority Building The initial plan had called for more inland freight operations to be erected in Manhattan. However the freight transportation changed and freight railroads played a dwindling importance in Manhattan. By 1947 its initial mission was pretty much abandoned and it became the Port Authority Building which remained the Port Authority's headquarters until the opening of the World Trade Center in 1970. Transition to the digital age The massive building served a dwindling warehouse/backoffice outpost until 1998 when Taconic Investment Partners acquired it. Taconic began marketing it as a location to be used as a carrier hotel for the new booming internet business. This was coupled with the fashionable rise of the Chelsea neighborhood that surrounded it. Google The Ninth Avenue fa√ßade featuring the old Google corporate logo In 2010, Google, which had previously leased space in the building, contracted to purchase the entire building, in a deal reported to be worth around $1.9 billion. The building's meet-me room in its carrier hotel was once the biggest in the city (the other big meet-me room is at 60 Hudson Street). 111 8th Avenue is adjacent to trunk dark fiber lines stretching from Hudson Street and continuing up Ninth Avenue. That line at the time was owned by Lexent Metro Connect. There was speculation at the time of the acquisition that Google would use its strategic location to launch a Google Fiber operation in New York City. The Google Fiber plan never came to pass and Google has denied it has any plans to bring it to New York City anytime in the near future, although in 2013 it did begin offering free Wi-Fi to its Chelsea neighbors. The Lexent dark fiber line has been acquired by Lightower Fiber Networks. In 2013 the first class of the newly created Cornell NYC Tech school began classes in the building, in space donated by Google. Classes continued in the building until the school moved to its new location on Roosevelt Island in 2017.\\"Cornell Tech Campus Opens on Roosevelt Island\\" (Sept 12, 2017) Despite the massive size of the acquisition, Google has still found itself having to rent space elsewhere because it has been unable to break the leases with some of its tenants, including Nike, Deutsch Inc., and Bank of New York. After years of renting additional space across the street in the Chelsea Market, Google purchased that building in 2018.\\"Furthering our New York investment\\" (March 20, 2018) Notable tenants * Atlantic Theater Company * DigitalOcean See also * 1932 in architecture * 60 Hudson Street * List of buildings, sites, and monuments in New York City References External links * Category:Art Deco architecture in Manhattan Category:Data centers Category:Eighth Avenue (Manhattan) Category:Industrial buildings and structures in Manhattan Category:Internet in the United States Category:Office buildings completed in 1932 Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Manhattan Category:Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Category:Telecommunications buildings in the United States Category:Warehouses in the United States Category:1932 establishments in New York (state) Category:Google acquisitions ","title":"111 Eighth Avenue"},{"id":"29871286","text":"Acrocercops tricirrha is a moth of the family Gracillariidae.

Sir Francis was one of the founding members of the Royal Aero Club and one of the founders of naval aviation and amateur flying. Early life McClean was born on 1 February 1876, the son of astronomer Frank McClean, and was educated at Charterhouse before the Royal Indian Engineering College at Cooper's Hill. His grandfather John Robinson McClean, also a civil engineer, came from Belfast. McClean worked as a civil engineer in the Indian Public Works Department from 1898 to 1902 when he left to focus on aviation matters. Interest in astronomy Through is father's influence, McClean was an enthusiastic amateur astronomer and especially interested in solar eclipses. He was a volunteer assistant on the 30 August 1905 solar eclipse expedition to Palma, Majorca. McClean organized 2 astronomical expeditions: one to Flint Island for the 3 January 1908 solar eclipse and the other to Port Davey for the 9 May 1910 solar eclipse; however, bad weather thwarted observations in both expeditions. He also accompanied the expedition organized by Sir Norman Lockyer to Vava'u for the 28 April 1911 solar eclipse. McClean made generous gifts to the Lockyer Observatory. Aviator Frank McClean, caricatured 1909 His first flying experience was in 1907 in a balloon race in Berlin and in December 1908 he flew with Wilbur Wright at Le Mans. At the start of 1909 he began a co- operation with the Short Brothers to develop heavier-than-air aviation in Britain. McLean owned the ground on which the aerodromes at Leysdown and then Eastchurch were built. He was awarded Royal Aero Club Aviators Certificate Number. 21 after flying a Short S.27 biplane at Royal Naval Air Station Eastchurch on 20 September 1910. Between 1909 and 1914 he owned sixteen different aircraft, all but one built by Short Brothers.Barnes, C.H., Shorts Aircraft Since 1900 London: Putnam 1967, p.498. In February 1911 he offered to let both the Admiralty and War Office use the aircraft and airfield at Eastchurch to teach naval and military personnel to fly heavier-than-air machines. Although the War Office had declined, the Admiralty accepted and started to train the first naval aviators. McClean was also a pioneer in aerial photography: with the help of Hugh Spottiswoode he took some acclaimed photographs of the wreck of the SS Oceana SS Oceana sank on 16 March 1912 in collision with the Pisagua, which was towed into Dover. just off the coast at Eastbourne. In August 1912 he flew a floatplane between the upper and lower parts of Tower Bridge and underneath London Bridge. In 1914 he made a flight following the course of the Nile between Alexandria and Khartoum in a specially built four-seater aircraft, the Short S.80 The Nile. Beset by mechanical problems, the flight took from 2 January until 22 March. Upon the outbreak of the First World War in August he was commissioned in the Royal Naval Air Service and carried out patrols in the English Channel before becoming chief instructor at Eastchurch. He transferred to the Royal Air Force when it was formed in 1918 but resigned his commission in 1919. McLean was a founder member of the Aero Club of Great Britain (later the Royal Aero Club) and was Chairman in 1923-24 and again from 1941-44. McClean served as High Sheriff of Oxfordshire for 1932/33. Family and later life McClean married Aileen Wale in 1918 and they had two daughters. Their elder daughter, Frances, married Sir Arthur Eliott of Stobs, 11th Bt, and their younger daughter, Iona, married Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington. In 1932, Sir Francis was appointed High Sheriff of Oxfordshire. He died on 11 August 1955 in London after a long illness. His name is listed on a memorial on the Isle of Sheppey commemorating thirteen pioneer aviators. The family of Sir Francis McClean have loaned his papers to the Fleet Air Arm Museum.

Working with Rezolution Pictures, Diamond has directed the documentary films Reel Injun, The Last Explorer, One More River, Heavy Metal: A Mining Disaster in Northern Quebec and Cree Spoken Here, along with three seasons of DAB IYIYUU, a series for the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network about Cree elders. In the 2008 docudrama The Last Explorer, Diamond explored the story of his great-uncle George Elson, a Cree guide who helped to map Labrador as part of an ill-fated 1903 expedition with Leonidas Hubbard and Dillon Wallace, and a return voyage in 1905 with Hubbard's widow Mina Hubbard. As of April 2011, Diamond is developing a project with Inuit filmmaker Zacharias Kunuk about the 18th-century conflict between Cree and Inuit, which lasted almost a century. Reel Injun Reel Injun was inspired by Diamond's own experiences as a child in Waskaganish, where he and other Native children would play cowboys and Indians after local screenings of Westerns in their remote community. Diamond remembers that although the children were in fact \\"Indians,\\" they all wanted to be the cowboys. Afterwards, when he was old enough to move south to study, he would be questioned by non-Native people about whether his people lived in teepees and rode horses, causing Diamond to realize that their preconceptions about Native people were also derived from movies. These stereotypes motivated him to help America see the true identity of what a Native American was. Awards Diamond received the award for Best Direction in a Documentary Program at the 2010 Gemini Awards for Reel Injun. It also earned him a 2011 Peabody Award.

It was the last of Stephenson's 0-2-2 locomotives in the style of Rocket, but it introduced several innovations. It was the first locomotive to have the Stephenson type firebox incorporated in the boiler, and having a smokebox the full diameter of the boiler, it therefore had the first true 'locomotive' boiler. It also had plate frames, a proper tender, and the cylinders set at a relatively low angle to the horizontal, giving smoother running. The pace of development of locomotive design at the time can be seen by comparing this engine with Stephenson's Planet, produced later the same year. 1894 lithograph illustration depicting Northumbrian  References  Category:Early steam locomotives Category:Steam locomotives of Great Britain Category:0-2-2 locomotives Category:Locomotive boilers Category:Robert Stephenson and Company locomotives ","title":"Northumbrian (locomotive)"},{"id":"29871475","text":"Friedemann Layer (30 October 1941 ‚Äì 3 November 2019) was an Austrian conductor.

CPT can be provided in individual and group treatment formats. The theory behind CPT conceptualizes PTSD as a disorder of non- recovery, in which a sufferer's beliefs about the causes and consequences of traumatic events produce strong negative emotions, which prevent accurate processing of the traumatic memory and the emotions resulting from the events. Because the emotions are often overwhelmingly negative and difficult to cope with, PTSD sufferers can block the natural recovery process by using avoidance of traumatic triggers as a strategy to function in day-to-day living. Unfortunately, this limits their opportunities to process the traumatic experience and gain a more adaptive understanding of it. CPT incorporates trauma-specific cognitive techniques to help individuals with PTSD more accurately appraise these \\"stuck points\\" and progress toward recovery. History Development of CPT began in 1988 with work by Patricia Resick. Initial randomized controlled trials for treatment of PTSD were conducted by Candice M. Monson. Phases of treatment The primary focus of the treatment is to help the client understand and reconceptualize their traumatic event in a way that reduces its ongoing negative effects on their current life. Decreasing avoidance of the trauma is crucial to this, since it is necessary for the client to examine and evaluate their meta-emotions and beliefs generated by the trauma. The first phase consists of education regarding PTSD, thoughts, and emotions. The therapist seeks to develop rapport with, and gain the co-operation of, the client by establishing a common understanding of the client's problems and outlining the cognitive theory of PTSD development and maintenance. The therapist asks the client to write an impact statement to establish a current baseline of the client's understanding of why the event occurred and the impact that it has had on their beliefs about themselves, others, and the world. This phase focuses on identifying automatic thoughts and increasing awareness of the relationship between a person's thoughts and feelings. A specific focus is on teaching the client to identify maladaptive beliefs (\\"stuck points\\") that interfere with recovery from traumatic experiences. The next phase involves formal processing of the trauma. The therapist asks the client to write a detailed account of their worst traumatic experience, which the client then reads to the therapist in session. This is intended to break the pattern of avoidance and enable emotional processing to take place, with the ultimate goal being for the client to clarify and modify their cognitive distortions. Clinicians often use Socratic questioning to gently prompt the client, based on the idea that the client's own arrival at new cognitions about their trauma, as opposed to unquestioning acceptance of the clinician's interpretations, which is critical to recovery. Alternatively, CPT can be conducted without the use of written accounts (in a variant known as CPT-Cognitive, or CPT-C), which some clinicians have found to be equally effective and perhaps more efficient. This alternative method relies almost entirely on Socratic dialogue between the therapist and client. The final phase of treatment focuses on helping the client reinforce the skills they learned in the previous phase, with the intent that they can use those skills to further identify, evaluate, and modify their beliefs concerning their traumatic events. The intent is to allow the clients to exit treatment with the confidence and ability to use adaptive coping strategies in their post- treatment lives. This phase focuses on five conceptual areas that traumatic experiences most frequently cause damage to:Owens, G.P. & Chard, K.M. (2001).

Clients practice recognizing how their traumatic experiences resulted in over-generalized beliefs, as well as the impact of these beliefs on current functioning and quality of life. Therapy elements Four essential parts *Educating the patient about the specific post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and the way the treatment will help them. *Informing the patient about their thoughts and feelings. *Imparting lessons to the patient to help them develop skills to challenge or question their own thoughts. *Helping the patient to recognise changes in their beliefs that happened after going through the traumatic event.

(1695‚Äì1774), was an English Minorite friar and noted Catholic spiritual writer of the 18th century. Life Baker served as the Procurator and Definitor of his Order, and was twice elected Minister Provincial of the English province of the Order of Friars Minor, first in 1761 and again in 1770. He appears to have been attached to the chapel of the Sardinian Embassy on Lincoln's Inn Fields in London. He certainly attended at the execution of the Scottish Catholic nobleman, Lord Lovat, on Tower Hill on 9 April 1747. Baker's works were mostly guides for meditation for the proper reception of the Blessed Sacrament and on the liturgical seasons of the Church year. His reputation as a writer suffered in latter years. He was one of several religious authors who developed a series of books to allow Catholics who were isolated from the celebration of the Eucharist to meditate on its focus in keeping with the liturgical year of the Catholic Church. Baker encouraged the reception of the Blessed Sacrament by the laity as often as possible but recognized that, due to the lack of Catholic clergy in Britain in that era, this could be sporadic at best. His works provided the faithful with models for worship on the various Sundays through which they could participate in the liturgical life of the universal Church. His writings also proved popular for isolated Catholics on the American frontier. An evaluation of Baker's work in the 19th century described it as \\"remarkable for unction, solidity, and moderation\\". Baker died in London on 16 March 1774.

superheroes serving as the title characters and the protagonists of the Kick-Ass series, published by Marvel Comics under the company‚Äôs imprint Icon Comics, and by Image Comics. The duo was created by artist John Romita Jr. and writer Mark Millar. Prior to The Dave Lizewski Years series, Dave Lizewski is a high school student and comic book fan whose dreams inspire him to become a real-life superhero, going by the name \\"Kick-Ass\\", with no superpowers or training of any kind, while prior to The New Girl series, Patience Lee is an Afghanistan war veteran and single mother who dons the Kick-Ass costume and mantle to steal money from various crime bosses for her family. The Dave Lizewski version of Kick-Ass appeared in the feature film adaptations Kick-Ass and Kick-Ass 2 portrayed by Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Fictional character biography Dave Lizewski Dave Lizewski is a simple ordinary New York City high school student. His mother dies of a brain aneurysm and Dave serves as an anchor to reality for his loving single father. Dave takes an interest in comic books, which give him the idea to become a real-life superhero. He purchases a suit and mask, which he wears under his normal clothing, and he begins his own personal training before attempting to fight crime. His first attempt fails, with disastrous results as Dave is hospitalized following being stabbed and being hit by a car. Dave lies to his father, claiming he was mugged. He undergoes intense physical rehabilitation, including four operations. He is released weeks later, with metal plates all over his body and with his nerve endings having delayed reactions to pain, making him almost immune to conventional beatings. In spite of considering giving up crime-fighting, he soon returns to the streets. Kick-Ass rescues a man from a beating and fights off the thugs. An onlooker records the incident and uploads it on YouTube, turning Lizewski into an overnight sensation, given the name Kick-Ass. Kick-Ass becomes an inspiration for hundreds of people, most of whom are content to simply make web pages and costumes, but some of whom actually go out and effectively fight crime. Kick-Ass encounters two other crime-fighting heroes who call themselves Hit-Girl and Big Daddy, whose level of professionalism intimidates Kick-Ass and also serves to remind him just how serious crime-fighting can be. He retires from crime-fighting for a little while until he becomes aware of another hero, who calls himself Red Mist, who has become a sensation, even stealing all the credit for being the first-ever superhero. Kick-Ass subsequently leaves retirement, initially to challenge Red Mist, but instead, they team up. As they drive off they come across a burning building. Kick-Ass overhears a woman saying that her \\"baby\\" is still inside. Kick-Ass bravely enters the building with Red-Mist to rescue the baby, only to find out it is a cat called \\"Baby\\"; they rescue it and return it to its owner. Red Mist, however, turns out to be the son of mob boss John Genovese which leads to Big Daddy's death and the torture of Kick-Ass at the hands of various gangsters. Before long, Kick-Ass is rescued by Hit-Girl and the two get their revenge on John Genovese, together bringing down his entire organization. Kick-Ass shoots John Genovese's genitals off with a gun through a pure fluke, giving Hit-Girl an open opportunity to kill John Genovese with a cleaver. After the loss of Mindy's father, Dave drops her off at her mother's house. Dave returns home to find his father having sex with his teacher (whose boyfriend Hit-Girl had killed) on the couch. Hit-Girl subsequently takes on Kick-Ass as her crime- fighting partner, training him and using him to hunt criminals together with her. She also gets him to teach her how to be a normal kid, and get along with other girls somewhat older than herself.Kick-Ass: The Dave Lizewski Years Book Two Dave returns to training and fighting crime in New York City and is now being trained by Hit-Girl. Kick-Ass joins a new superhero team calling themselves Justice Forever, which includes his friends Marty and Todd, and his new crime-fighting ally, \\"Doctor Gravity\\". Led by the repentant born-again Christian \\"Colonel Stars\\", the group launches a campaign against the local crime families of the city. He now works frequently on gang-busting with his new-found team, as well as his long-time friend Marty as \\"Battle Guy\\", sharing inside crime-fighting jokes with him during his school life. He and the team break into a bar and apprehend a gang. Dave goes home to see that his dad has found his Kick-Ass costume and isn't happy about it. They argue about him being a hero, which leads Dave to storm out of the house. The massacre leads the police (led by Detective Vic Gigante, who secretly works for the Motherfucker as a mob informant) to scapegoat the super-heroes for the deaths. All known heroes are rounded up and put into police custody, including the members of Justice Forever. Kick-Ass avoids arrest due to his father, who discovers his son's super-hero alter ego, much to his horror. Despite his disapproval, Kick-Ass's father turns himself in to the authorities to save his son from arrest. Shortly after, he is attacked by mob henchmen of the Motherfucker, who kill him as part of the villain's campaign to torment his rival. The Motherfucker then attacks the funeral, detonating a bomb in Kick- Ass's father's coffin and has gunmen open fire upon the crowd of mourners, including Hit-Girl and her family. In response, Hit-Girl springs into action to kill the henchmen who kidnap Kick-Ass in the confusion. Kick-Ass and Hit- Girl team up as they raid the Motherfucker's lair and find out that the villain plans a second massacre in Times Square. Blowing up every single comic shop in New York (along with Kick-Ass's apartment), the Motherfucker seeks to create a distraction to ensure the police will not be around to keep the Motherfucker and his group from slaughtering every person in Times Square. Using social media, Kick-Ass alerts all of the heroes still free to meet with him in Times Square to fight the Motherfucker's minions. The Motherfucker starts his killing spree, only to be stopped by the army of heroes backing up Kick-Ass. As the police arrive on scene unable to tell the heroes from members of the Motherfucker's group, they proceed to arrest all the remaining masked combatants, allowing Motherfucker to escape. Kick-Ass chases after him and after a rooftop fight, Motherfucker falls to the ground, mortally wounded. Reluctantly, Kick-Ass summons help but gets accused of attempting to kill his rival.Kick-Ass: The Dave Lizewski Years Book Three Dave graduates from high school and continues his life as a superhero in his battle against organized crime. As he plans to break Mindy out of prison, he asks Justice Forever for assistance, but they refuse to help. After a fight with a gang of criminals, Dave meets a woman named Valerie and starts dating her. At a party to celebrate Chris' release, Kick-Ass arranges to get the members of Justice Forever to help him raid the party and send a warning to the mob. The plan fails when Kick-Ass' friends flee in the face of mob retaliation. Elsewhere, Mindy confides to her psychiatrist that she has circumvented the prison's security so as to allow her to wander around and kill problematic inmates at night. Furthermore, she talks about how her father created his false backstory in order to manipulate her into continuing her career as Hit-Girl. Mindy also meets her mother, who is proud of her actions as Hit-Girl. Gigante and three disguised cops rob Rocco, intending to make a fortune and leave New York. In response, Rocco orders the killing of everyone found in a mask, resulting in the deaths of four Justice Forever members and the kidnapping of Dave's roommate Todd. Later Kick-Ass rescues Mindy from a cop working for Rocco, brutally killing him. Dave goes to rescue Todd in Big Daddy's monster truck. Dave is briefly overpowered by the thugs holding Todd, but ends up electrocuting them all. Dave decides to abandon his superhero identity, instead of joining the police and remaining with Valerie. Marcus is cleared of all charges thanks to Gigante's testimony and has rooted out the remaining corrupt elements from the force. Dave never sees Mindy again, though he does hear of her further exploits across the world and the emergence of genuine superhumans.Kick-Ass: The Dave Lizewski Years Book Four Patience Lee Patience Lee is an Afghanistan war veteran who returns to find her husband has left her and run up large debts. She decides to steal cash from the people ruining the neighborhood, pay off her debts and give half away. She dons the Kick-Ass costume and allows herself to be caught. Once inside she uses her combat skills to take down the gangsters, and forces the boss at gunpoint to hand over all the money; after said boss sends gangsters after Patience's family, she kills them and the boss before taking over his operations as a new crime boss under the \\"Kick-Ass\\" name.Kick-Ass: The New Girl Book One (September 2018)Kick-Ass: The New Girl Book TwoKick-Ass: The New Girl Book ThreeKick-Ass: The New Girl Book Four Skills and abilities Dave Lizewski After his first unsuccessful attempt at superheroes ends in being beaten, mugged and hit by a moving car, he has several metal plates and braces surgically implanted within his body during the course of his hospitalization and recovery. This, along with the nerve damage he suffers during the event, provides him with the ability to be almost immune to pain, giving him an edge while fighting. His only weapons are his twin batons that are wrapped in green electrical tape. In the sixth issue of Kick-Ass 2, he upgraded his twin batons by adding barbed wire around them. In the film version of Kick-Ass, he becomes adept at handling firearms. Due to not having fighting experiences in his life, he receives hand-to-hand combat training from Hit-Girl. Patience Lee Family Dave Lizewski At the start of the first comic series, Dave‚Äôs mother, Alice Lizewski, died of a brain aneurysm when Dave was 14. Dave lives with his father, James Lizewski, after his mother died. Dave and his father had a very strong, close relationship. He is fully aware of his secret in Kick-Ass 2. He is beaten to death and hanged by Chris Genovese (aka The Motherfucker, formerly Red Mist) while in prison after he tells the police that he is Kick-Ass. Patience Lee Patience was originally married to Frankie Lee. However, they divorce after he abandons her once she returns from her Army tour in Afghanistan, leaving her to be a single mother to their children, son, Jordan \\"Jordy,\\" and daughter, Grace. When Patience takes over the criminal empire of one of the gangsters she defeated, she starts being blackmailed by her ex-brother-in-law, Maurice. The names of her parents are never given, but she does have a sister named Edwina. In other media Films The Dave Lizewski incarnation of character appears in the 2010 film adaptation Kick-Ass, and the 2013 sequel Kick-Ass 2. Aaron Johnson, who plays the character, says that Kick-Ass is a \\"sensitive guy\\" who lost his mother and is a \\"nobody\\" at school, so he creates his superhero identity \\"as this whole different persona.\\" Johnson said that Dave is \\"a kid who‚Äôs got the guts to go out there and do something different.\\"Wallace, Lewis. \\"Hit Girl‚Äôs Revenge: The Kick-Ass Kids Are All Right.\\" Wired. 16 April 2010. 1. Retrieved 25 January 2011. In preparation for the role, Johnson received fitness and stunt training, and did a couple of weeks of doing fight choreography. He also requires a dialect coach for the American accent to suit the character. In 2018, Mark Millar said that he'd like to see Tessa Thompson portray the Patience Lee incarnation of the character in a prospective third Kick-Ass film, Thompson stating that she was \\"highly interested\\" in the role. Video games Kick-Ass (Dave Lizewski) appears as a playable character in Kick-Ass: The Game and Kick-Ass 2: The Game, each respectively based on the two films. Toys In 2010 Mezco released Kick-Ass figures based on the first film and followed-up with new figures released in 2013 by Neca.

Associated with the Institute of Pharmacology of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Krak√≥w, at which he was a Professor, Head of the Department of Biochemistry (1976‚Äì2006), Deputy Director for Science Affairs (1994‚Äì2002) and Vice Chairman of the Scientific Council (2003‚Äì2017), he published more than 240 original research papers. He first gained recognition for an early hypothesis of the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs, suggesting in 1975 together with Fridolin Sulser that downregulation of beta- adrenergic receptors is responsible for their effects.Sulser F., Vetulani J.: Action of various antidepressant treatments reduces reactivity of noradrenergic cyclic AMP generating system in limbic forebrain, \\"Nature\\", 257, 1975. At the time, Vetulani was a Research Associate Professor at the Vanderbilt University (1973‚Äì1975). In 1983, he received Anna-Monika Prize for research on the mechanisms of the electroconvulsive therapy. Beside depression, his scientific interests included memory, addiction and neurodegeneration. He was active in the field of popular science and became a recognizable science communicator in Poland. He headed the popular science magazine Wszech≈õwiat as its editor-in-chief (1981‚Äì2002), and was known for his popular lectures that gathered large audiences on various occasions. Since 2010 he ran a blog and social media channels, and authored several popular science books, some of which became bestsellers. In the Polish People's Republic, he was active in the democratic opposition and became a member of the Solidarity in 1980. Declaring as an atheist, he kept a close and sympathetic connection with Pope John Paul II for several decades. In 2002 he unsuccessfully ran for the presidency of Krak√≥w. Throughout his life, he engaged in several cultural and social initiatives. In his twenties, he was an announcer at Piwnica pod Baranami cabaret (1954‚Äì1961), and in his seventies he became a performer in the live magazine GadajƒÖcy Pies (The Talking Dog, 2010‚Äì2015). He publicly argued for the legalization of marijuana and wide depenalization of drugs for adult users, severely criticizing repressive drug policy of Poland and other countries. An honorary fellow of Indian Academy of Neurosciences and Oxford Neurological Society, honorary doctor of the Medical University of Silesia and the Medical University of ≈Å√≥d≈∫, he received numerous awards and state distinctions, including the Knight's Cross of Polonia Restituta.  Biography   1936‚Äì1952: Early years and rebellion Jerzy with his mother 250px He was born on January 21, 1936 at the private gynecological hospital at Garncarska Street in Krak√≥w, Poland as the son of Adam Vetulani, Professor and head of the Department of Church Law at the Jagiellonian University, and Irena Latinik, a biologist and daughter of Polish Army general Franciszek Latinik. In 1938 his younger brother Jan was born. The family occupied an apartment on the ground floor of the house of professors of the Jagiellonian University at Plac Inwalid√≥w, employing a maid, cook and Olga Rutter, a child educator. As Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, Adam Vetulani took part in the defense war. With his unit, he went to Romania and then to France, where he also fought on the front. Eventually he was interned in Switzerland, where he spent the rest of the war organizing school camps for Polish soldiers. The correspondence sent to the occupied Poland was signed by the Fraulein Kupfer alias. After the German army entered Cracow, Irena Vetulani and her sons had to leave the apartment. They were given forty- eight hours to move, with the possibility of keeping movable property. They moved to the premises at Garncarska Street 4, where J√≥zefa Onitsch, the wife of General Zygmunt Zieli≈Ñski, gave them refuge. The family was supported by Adam Vetulani's brother, Tadeusz, who has been living in Cracow during the war. Thanks to her good knowledge of German, Irena took up her job as a translator in the spirit monopoly. Jerzy and Jan remained in war years under the care of the mother who raised both sons \\"in a patriotic sense of honor\\". Every Sunday at home there was a \\"mystery\\" and the family used to sing Polish, Catholic religious song Bo≈ºe, co≈õ Polskƒô. In his childhood, Jerzy was a religious boy; he even served as an altar boy at St. Mary's Basilica. Vetulani recalled the war years as interesting, full of fascinating activity and exploring the surrounding world, undermining the collective, martyrological picture of despair and misery. Together with his younger brother and friend from the tenement house, Andrzej Mirocki, they founded an insect gatherer club. For the most spectacular and precious part of their collection, they recognized a diverse collection of butterflies. Mother never let children witness one of the street executions. Jerzy began his education in 1942 and immediately entered the second class of secret sets led by Mrs. Iwiczowa, as he was already able to read and write. From 1948 he attended the Henryk Sienkiewicz High School in Cracow, and then, after his liquidation, Bart≈Çomiej Nowodworski High School, where he passed matura in 1952, obtaining a certificate with a distinction for best pupils. Already as a teenager, Vetulani has completely walked away from religion. He described himself from a young age as \\"a rebel who did a lot of things in spite of his parents.\\" At the age of twelve he enrolled in the Union of Polish Youth. He was removed from the organization as a result of a typo in the school newspaper article. In the text he mistakenly and unconsciously, instead of \\"the basis of socialism\\" (podstawy socjalizmu), he wrote \\"the washers of socialism\\" (podsrawy socjalizmu). Later he also joined the Atheists and Freethought Club. He belonged to the Revolutionary Youth Union, a formation of idealistic communists who were striving for reform of Polish communist system that they considered defective.  1952‚Äì1973: Studies, cabaret, Institute of Pharmacology  Vetulani in the 1960s In 1952 he began his studies in biology at the Jagiellonian University (specializing in animal physiology), which he completed in 1957, defending his thesis on the effects of ascorbic acid on rabbit blood. In March 1956, he began a volunteer internshipat at the Department of Pharmacology of the Polish Academy of Sciences (later renamed the Institute of Pharmacology), where he has been working since, until the end of his life. Janusz Supniewski was head of the Department at that time. In 1957, after obtaining master's degree, Vetulani was hired as an assistant. Later, also at the Jagiellonian University, he studied chemistry (specializing in theoretical chemistry). He graduated in 1963. As an exchange student he spent seven weeks in Swansea, where he worked at the British Iron and Steel Research Association. He rented a room at a senior Welsh marriage and studied English intensively; every day he bought an edition of Daily Mirror and underlined unknown words, that he later learned. He was one of the founders and permanent regulars of the Piwnica pod Baranami cabaret. In the mid 1950s, together with a group of friends: Edmund Jarosz, Bronis≈Çaw Chromy and Lala SkƒÖpska, he took part in the demolition of the basement at Palace Pod Baranami, which soon became room for the cabaret. In 1958, when Piotr Skrzynecki left for Paris, Vetulani temporarily replaced him as a conference caller. It was in Piwnica that he met his future wife, Maria PajƒÖk, whose appearance at the time he compared to Marina Vlady's. They married on 8 July 1963. Soon after that their sons Marek and Tomasz were born, respectively in 1964 and 1965. They also have four grandchildren. In 1955‚Äì1962 he acted as a speaker at the Cracow Student Film Discussion Club. Vetulani admitted that \\"it was a good thing because \\"it taught him to speak short, interesting and fast\\". In 1972 he was a scientific consultant for the film Illumination directed by Krzysztof Zanussi. After the death of his brother, who drowned during a canoeing on the Dunajec River in 1965, he mobilized to begin work on his Ph.D. dissertation. He obtained Ph.D. degree in natural sciences in 1966 from Ludwik Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy of the Polish Academy of Sciences upon dissertation The action of isoxazole and pyrazole derivatives on the metabolism of the animal system prepared under the direction of Professor J√≥zef Hano. In the same year went to Great Britain for one year Riker scholarship. In the UK he worked on mastering spectrofluorimetric methods at the University of Cambridge under the direction of Arnold Burgen. During his stay in Cambridge, he encountered Bo≈ºena Puchalska and Juliusz Hibner. After returning to Poland he started work in the field of psychopharmacology under the direction of Jerzy Maj. 1973‚Äì1989: In the orbit of world science. Opposition  After submitting a habilitation dissertation, he left to the United States for almost two years. There, he worked from 1973 to 1975 as Research Associate Professor at the Vanderbilt University. He gained international recognition after the discovery in 1975, with Fridolin Sulser, of Œ≤-downregulation by chronic administration of antidepressants and the formulation of Œ≤-downregulation hypothesis as a mechanism of action of antidepressants. The work on this subject, published by Vetulani and Sulser in Nature, became citation classic, receiving 580 vocations by 2007. After his mother's death, he and his family decided to return to Poland. Vetulani received his habilitation degree in 1976 (upon work Neuroleptics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors and dopamine beta-hydroxylase inhibitors: their actions and synergies), an associate professor in 1983, and a professor in 1989. In 1976, he was appointed Head of the Department of Biochemistry at Institute of Pharmacology. In the 1970s he translated several short stories by Ursula le Guin for magazine Przekr√≥j. In Przekr√≥j he also published short articles on his stay in the United States. Back in the 1960s he was offered regular work in Przekr√≥j by its long-time editor-in-chief Marian Eile, but refused due to lack of possibility to combine scientific career with a full-time job as a columnist in a weekly. Since 1978 he has regularly collaborated with the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR, National Research Council) in Rome. On behalf of the Institute of Pharmacology of the Polish Academy of Sciences he was a coordinator of the joint research program of his home Institute with the Istituto di Biology Cellulare and Neurobiology (IBCN). When visiting Rome, he usually received an audience with John Paul II, who was a student of his father and friend of the family. In 1983 Vetulani received International Anna-Monika Prize (2nd class) for his research on the mechanism of electroconvulsion. In years 1981‚Äì2002 he was the editor-in-chief of Wszech≈õwiat, one of the oldest Polish popular science magazines. He was also the editor-in-chief of the Polish Journal of Pharmacology and Pharmacy (1993‚Äì1996). He obtained the title of Associate Professor in 1983 and the title of full Professor in 1989. From 1980 he was an activist in the Solidarity movement. He was a member of the Solidarity Work Committee to the Department and Branches of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Krak√≥w and was the 56th member of the Coordinating Commission for Science. In 1987‚Äì1989 he was a member of the Solidarity's Board of the Ma≈Çopolska Region, at the end of that period, from 1989‚Äì1990 he was a member of the Presidium of the Board. He mainly dealt with programming matters and advised organization's authorities in the region. In the work for Solidarity he took advantage of the position of the editor-in-chief of a scientific magazine; during the martial law he smuggled a letter from Solidarity's region authorities from Poland to Vatican, where he passed it to pope John Paul II. He thought this smuggling was possible only because he wasn't searched, as a person at such an important position, and accompanied in his travel to Italy then by Mieczys≈Çaw Czuma, editor-in-chief of Przekr√≥j.  1989‚Äì2006: Late career and social activity  Vetulani was a member of Solidarity Citizens' Committee (1989‚Äì1990) and Krak√≥w Solidarity Club (1994‚Äì1995). Between 1992 and 1998 he was a member of the Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharmacologicum. In 1999‚Äì2001 he was the President of the Polish Neuroscience Society. He also introduced Polish term for neurofibrillary tangles, which he called splƒÖtki neurofibrylarne. In 1991 he was appointed a correspondent member of the Polish Academy of Learning. He was appointed a full member in 1996. He regularly held meetings of the Scientific Cafe at the Polish Academy of Learning at S≈Çawkowska Street 17, as the opening and moderator of the discussions. He was a Member of the Board of the Krak√≥w Society of Friends of Fine Arts (2001‚Äì2017) and a member of the chapter of the Laurel of Krak√≥w Award (also 2001‚Äì2017). He was a member of the Board of the Society for the Advancement and Promotion of Science and member of the Warsaw Scientific Society and the European Dana Alliance for the Brain (EDAB). In 2002 he was appointed Vice-Chairman of the Scientific Council of the Insitiute of Pharmacology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. In 2002 he was a founding member of the Forum for Ma≈Çopolska Association and ran unsuccessfully for the presidency of the city of Krak√≥w, obtaining 2375 votes (1.19%) in the first round of elections. In 2008 he was elected a correspondent member of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Over the years, he held various functions in the Academy's structures. He was the Secretary of the Committee of Physiological Sciences (1978‚Äì1981), Chair of the Neurobiology Committee (2007‚Äì2011), a member of the Scientific Council of the Institute of Experimental Biology (1993‚Äì2007) and the Institute of Experimental and Clinical Medicine (2003‚Äì2007) of the Polish Academy of Sciences.  2006‚Äì2017: Towards popular science  Vetulani giving a lecture, 2013 In 2006, Vetulani left the position of Head of the Department of Biochemistry of the Institute of Pharmacology of the Polish Academy of Sciences and devoted himself to a large degree to popular science. In this field he was active already in the 1960s when he published short texts in Wszech≈õwiat, as a rule signing articles with his own name or with pseudonym J. Latini. After 2000 he became known for his popular science lectures, which focused on themes connected with the functioning of human brain and the relationship between neuroscience and various social and cultural aspects. In 1999 he was a lecturer during the Cracow Brain Days, and since 2000 he has performed every year at the Cracow Brain Week organized as a part of World Brain Awareness Week. Since June 2010 Vetulani ran a blog titled Piƒôkno neurobiologii (The Beauty of Neuroscience) on WordPress. There, he published articles on discoveries in the fields of neuroscience and psychopharmacology and comments on the curiosities of the human brain and, additionally, various cultural and social matters. The direct cause of the founding of the site was the removal of Vetulani's column in Wprost magazine by the newly elected editor-in-chief Tomasz Lis. As the main motivator for blogging Vetulani has pointed the desire to share his own knowledge with others. In a 2011 interview he said, \\"Soon, what's in my brain will kick the bucket, so I have to try to pass on to others as much as I can.\\". He chose this form of sharing his texts because of the ability to reach wide group of readers, as well as because of the independence and freedom of content and deadlines. Since December 2011, he has also run a channel on YouTube, on which has published videos and records of his lectures. Vetulani published several popular articles on the topic of neuroscience, he has often given interviews for various magazines and appeared in the radio and television, becoming, especially in the last decade of his life, a celebrity in science. After 1989 Vetulani politically sympathized with the center and the left. He has publicly supported specific candidats for public offices. In the 2010 presidential election in both rounds he supported Bronis≈Çaw Komorowski and in the parliamentary election a year later J√≥zef Lassota. In 2014 European Parliament election he supported Jan Hartman, expressing at the same time his solidarity with R√≥≈ºa Thun. Prior to the first round of presidential election in 2015, he supported Janusz Palikot. In the same year, in the parliamentary election he again supperted Lassota's candidature, congratulating him after obtaining a seat in the Sejm. In the 2000s he lectured regularly at several colleges in Krak√≥w. He was a Professor of the Ma≈Çopolska Higher Vocational School of J. Dietl in Krak√≥w, where he taught classes in cosmetology and dietetics (neurobiological aspect) and the School of Medicine in English at the Jagiellonian University Collegium Medicum. He also lectured at the Faculty of Applied Psychology at the Jagiellonian University and at the Pontifical University of John Paul II. In 2010 he performed in a lip dub created by the community of Jagiellonian University. He appeared in its opening sequence as a grandfather of a little girl, the main character in the clip. Also from 2010 Vetulani regularly appeared on the stage of the talking magazine GadajƒÖcy Pies (The Talking Dog), of which he became one of the main attractions and recognizable signs over time. One of the showrunners, Maciej Piotr Prus, described Vetulani as \\"the star of the first magnitude\\", adding that all participants were always waiting for his speeches. Vetulani compared the atmosphere of The Talking Dog to the ambience present in the beginnings of Piwnica pod Baranami. In his short presentations, the scientist used obscene humor and vulgarity, which some considered to be a violation of good taste, but most of the audience was enthusiastic to this kind of performance. In 2013 Vetulani performed and was the executive producer of the short film Hydrophobia, a mockumentary that ridiculed social phobias and premiered also at The Talking Dog. He co-created the performance Dreams Music directed by Czet Minkus, where he performed alongside Jan Peszek and Agata Zubel; the show was presented on December 19, 2013 in the Ma≈Çopolska Garden of Art (MOS). In 2010 and 2015 Vetulani performed with Leszek D≈Çugosz with a concert program Rozumie m√≥j (Oh, My Mind), in which poetry sung by D≈Çugosz was exchanged with Vetulani's neuroscience commentary. On December 31, 2014 he was appointed a member of the Program Board of the Station in Rome of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Since 2014, he has been supporting auctions of the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity; he devoted for auctions signed books and the opportunity to meet him at coffee or dinner. In 2015 and 2017 he was in the Honorary Committee of the Parada R√≥wno≈õci (Equality Parade, pride parade held in Warsaw). Following the rule of Law and Justice party in Poland he sharply criticized their reforms, expressing his support for some of the actions undertaken by the Committee for the Defence of Democracy; he participated in the protest against taking over public media by the ruling party in January 2016, saying that although he found some parts of the protest \\"rather of primitive character\\", he \\"had the fantastic atmosphere of the event: in spite of the January chill ‚Äì the crowds of old and young full of energy, each step you meet a friend (...). The event had both high civic and social value\\". Invited by students, he participated in the protest on the Main Market Square in Krak√≥w in January 2017. He also supported Black Protest, what he manifested by simply wearing black clothes. In November 2016, an exhibition of photographs by Adam Golc from Vetulani's eightieth birthday party, that Vetulani organized in his home hosting at once around one hundred and eighty people, was opened at the Galeria Olympia. During Vetulani's party, Golec portrayed the guests in a specially prepared mini-studio, on the background painted by Iwona Siwek-Front.  Accident and death  On March 2, 2017, in the evening, Vetulani, who was at the age of 81, was hit by an automobile at the pedestrian crossing receiving serious injuries. Vetulani was walking home from his regular place of work, the Institute of Pharmacology of the Polish Academy of Sciences, taking a route he knew very well. Directly after the accident he was put into a pharmacological coma, and his condition was determined as severe but stable. He was being treated at the Emergency Medicine Rescue and Disaster Center at the Szpital Uniwersytecki (University Hospital) in Krak√≥w, under the supervision of the team of Professor Jerzy Wordliczek. Vetulani's health, however, did not improve and he died in the hospital on April 6, 2017. He was buried on April 18, 2017 in the Avenue of the Meritorious at the Rakowicki Cemetery in Krak√≥w. Aleksander Janicki, visual artist and Vetulani's friend was the master of the ceremony which was carried out in a secular rite. Among the speakers at the funeral were Mayor of Krak√≥w Jacek Majchrowski, president of the Polish Academy of Learning Andrzej Bia≈Ças, Member of the Sejm J√≥zef Lassota, and also friends and family of the late scientist. His wife Maria Vetulani died few months later, on September 21, 2017.  Views  As crucial in shaping his worldview, Vetulani pointed The Naked Ape by English zoologist Desmond Morris. He first came across Morris's work in Cambridge in 1967 and said: \\"Thanks to this book for the first time I saw that you could approach a man like a normal animal species. (...) I realized at that time how ridiculous is a man who, as an animal instead of on all fours, is walking on two legs. How funny we look, hairless almost all over the body. (...) I also got rid of the belief in the superuniqueness of Homo sapiens\\". Vetulani defined the source of happiness and fulfillment of life, considered from the perspective of biology, as the immortalization of one's own genes by passing them on to the next generations. He often referred to Theodosius Dobzhansky's well-known quotation and the title of one of Dobzhansky's works: Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution. Vetulani was close to the philosophy of utilitarianism of John Stuart Mill; he said: \\"Moral is what serves to increase the happiness of mankind. There is only one problem ‚Äì unfortunately we have no way of summing up that happiness\\". He was a fan of fantasy and science fiction literature, and especially of authors such as Ursula K. Le Guin, Isaac Asimov, J. R. R. Tolkien and George R. R. Martin. As his motto he adopted a phrase from Asimov's Foundation: \\"May your moral sense never lead you to make a wrong decision\\".

Delaval was born in Paris, France to opera singers Henri Larriv√©e and Marie-Jeanne Larriv√©e Lemiere. She had one sister, Agathe-Elisabeth- Henriette, who was given violin lessons while Adelaide focused on the harp. Both girls were students of Jean-Baptiste Krumpholtz. When their parents separated in 1767, the girls provided for their guardian and aunt, Elisabeth- Henriette Larriv√©e, by touring through French provinces in concerts. Adelaide married Pierre Delaval on August 3, 1790, in Lyon. They moved with Agathe to London during the French Revolution. She was employed by Johann Peter Salomon for concerts at Hanover Square in London in 1790 and played for the first Haydn concert in 1792. She was also employed by the Ashleys for concerts in Convent Gardens in 1796. Her works have been edited for publication by harpist Jessica Suchy-Pilalis.

It conducts research and teaching activities related to physics at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The School of Physics offers bachelor's degrees in Physics or Applied Physics. A core of technical courses gives a strong background in mathematics and the physical principles of mechanics, electricity and magnetism, thermodynamics, and quantum theory. The School of Physics also offers programs of study leading to certificates in Applied Optics; Atomic, Molecular, and Chemical Physics; and in Computer Bases Instrumentation. History The Physics Department was one of the eight original departments created, when Georgia Tech opened in 1888. The first chair of the department was Isaac S. Hopkins, who also became Georgia Tech's first president. At the outset, Georgia Tech closely modeled itself after the Worcester \\"Free School\\" in Worcester, Massachusetts (now the Worcester Polytechnic Institute) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. The curricula of such schools emphasized primarily an amalgamation of undergraduate physics education with engineering. In the 1920s and 1930s the physics department, under the directorship of J. B. Edwards, was closely tied to applied research connected with public and private companies. During the latter decades of the twentieth century, the groups specialized in applied, interdisciplinary, and pure research. The applied and interdisciplinary centers include the Center for Nonlinear Science (CNS), which consists of thirteen core members and ten associate members. In addition, the center hosts visiting faculty. There is also the Center for Relativistic Astrophysics, which consists of ten core members working on problems including gravitational waves. The Howey-Physics Building, home to physics and calculus, was named after Joseph H. Howey. The building, which he played such an important role in designing, was dedicated and named the Joseph H. Howey physics building on September 17, 1976. Joseph Howey served as Director of the School of Physics at Georgia Tech for 28 years (1935‚Äì1963). The School of Physics's administrative offices, as well as those of most of its faculty and graduate students, are located in the Howey-Physics Building on the main campus. Degrees offered The School of Physics offers a bachelor's degree in both pure and Applied Physics plus both master's and doctoral degrees in several fields. These degrees are technically granted by the School's parent organization, the Georgia Tech College of Sciences, and often awarded in conjunction with other academic units within Georgia Tech. The graduate program was initiated under Joseph Howey's leadership and the undergraduate program grew in stature to become one of the larger departments in the United States. Howey remained at the helm of the School of Physics for 28 years. Doctoral degree * Ph.D. in Philosophy of physics Master's degree * M.S. in Physics Bachelor's degrees * B.S. in Physics * B.S. in Applied Physics Research The graduate curriculum in the School of Physics provides the background and training needed to conduct research. Completion of the Ph.D. program in Physics requires completion of course work, participation in seminars and Special Problems, acceptance into Ph.D. candidacy, and thesis research. Every faculty member of the School of Physics earned a Ph.D. degree and completed post-doctoral research positions prior to embarking on his or her independent academic careers. In addition, each member of the faculty teaches at both the undergraduate and graduate level. Several faculty members are involved with CETL (Georgia Tech‚Äôs Center for Enhancement of Teaching and Learning) and CEISMIC (Georgia Tech‚Äôs Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics and Computing). CETL offers courses that teach the graduate students how to teach. CEISMIC operates over 20 programs from K-12 students and/or teachers, partnering in the process with many of the Georgia public school systems and prominent educational agencies. These two centers are available to students.

He is portrayed by Brian Benben. History Sheldon's father was a surgeon. He originally wanted to be a surgeon but switched to psychiatry during his intern year.Private Practice: Season 3, Episode 16 \\"Fear of Flying\\" Dr. Sheldon Wallace is a board-certified psychiatrist with extensive training in general adult and adolescent psychotherapy as well as diagnostic evaluation. Dr. Wallace trained at Stanford Medical School but also spent time serving in the National Guard, where he honed his darts skills. Storylines Season 2 In season 2 of Private Practice, Sheldon is hired by Charlotte King as the psychiatrist for Pacific Wellcare where he meets and starts up a relationship with fellow psychiatrist Violet Turner. Sheldon initially had problems in his relationship with Violet in the bedroom because he feels inadequate, but he later works them out. When Violet gets pregnant, Sheldon tells her he loves her and proposes to her, despite not knowing who the father is. Violet doesn't answer straight away, and Pete instead tells Violet he should have fought for her and loves her, and she chooses Pete over Sheldon. Ultimately, Pete lets it slip that Violet has chosen him. Sheldon sadly but gracefully steps aside. Season 3 In Season 3 of Private Practice, Sheldon is among the group blaming himself for what has happened to Violet, and he and Pete get into a fight. Later, Sheldon requests a paternity to test on Violet's son, Lucas, and the tests reveal Pete to be the father and Sheldon once again gracefully backs away. Throughout the season Sheldon struggles to find his place in the practice and ultimately pursues a relationship with Charlotte who is still in love with Cooper. The two grow even closer but Charlotte's heart is clearly with Cooper. In the season finale he professes his love for Charlotte and is heartbroken when she gets engaged to Cooper. Season 4 In Season 4 of Private Practice, Sheldon continues to be the resident \\"therapist\\" to all his friends and colleagues. Amelia Shepherd makes sexual advances on him based on what both Charlotte and Violet have to say about their past sexual experiences with him and they tell Amelia that Sheldon plays hard to get. Early in the season he inadvertently discovers the identity of the man who raped Charlotte; he had interviewed the man, Lee McHenry, the night she was attacked and he had her blood on him. He later confronts McHenry, telling him he knows that McHenry will rape again. He starts an affair with a writer who gave Violet's new book a bad review despite the warning from Cooper that the affair is going to jeopardise his friendship with Violet. Season 5 During this season Sheldon finds himself trying to help Pete after his heart attack and Violet after she is reinstated and allowed to practice medicine. The one person he can't help is Amelia, as he is firmly against her helping her friend commit physician-assisted suicide. After Amelia's friend kills herself, Amelia goes on a drug binge and begins using with her boyfriend, and later fianc√©. During an intervention, Sheldon constantly tries to reason and talk with Amelia who tells him she will never love him. After Amelia checks into rehab, she and Sheldon talk and visit one another and seem to be on track for resuming their friendship. Season 6 Sheldon is treating a patient that has thoughts of the sexual nature toward little girls. One night, this man is at the hospital the same night a little girl goes missing. Sheldon immediately thinks it is this man and runs to the room he is in to find him still in there and apologizes right away but the patient does not want to see Sheldon anymore. That same night Sheldon runs into a woman at the vending machine. Her candy got stuck, he tries to hit it loose with no avail, so he puts in money to get it to go out for her. Eventually this patient goes to see Sheldon again, saying he is getting better and has a lady friend named Alyssa. Sheldon thinks it's the little girl that went missing but has no proof. As the sessions go on, things seem to be going wrong with ‚ÄúAlyssa‚Äù and Sheldon goes to the cops saying he knows he's breaking protocol but he thinks his patient has the missing girl. The cops say they cannot go on a hunch. Sheldon has another session and confronts him. Then he has cops come to put him in a psychiatric hold saying he threatened to hurt himself. Sheldon then tells the cops that his patient confessed to having the little girl. The cops and Sheldon go to the house and the little girl is indeed in the basement alive. While all that was going on, Sheldon finds out he has prostate cancer. He begins going to radiation everyday. The woman from the vending machine, whose name is Miranda, is going to radiation right before him each day as well. They connect instantly but Miranda only wants to exchange pleasantries because she has terminal cancer. Eventually, their connection can't keep them apart and they fall for one another. One day Miranda falls and is rushed to the hospital. She has a seizure. Her cancer is getting worse. She signs herself out of the hospital against medical advice. Sheldon is upset at her for this. She tells Sheldon to leave. She says please do this for me and go! He won't so she walks away. He goes to work, talks with Sam and Jake, admits he is madly in love and quits. Sheldon then goes to find Miranda. He tells her he will be with her until the very last moment and that he loves her. He says he is not walking away and she asks what they will do with the rest of her life? He says anything since he quit his job. We then see them at an exotic location as they hold hands laying together on the beach.

It was formerly called the Tabeguache. Tabeguache Ouray (Ute leader) The Tabeguache (Taveewach,Taviwach, and Taviwac), or ‚ÄúPeople of Sun Mountain,‚Äù was the largest of the ten nomadic bands of the Ute and part of the Northern Ute People. They lived in river valleys of the Gunnison River and Uncompahgre River between the Parianuche to the north and the Weeminuche to the south. They traveled seasonally. Like other Ute, they were hunters who followed and hunted buffalo, deer, and elk. They moved their camp about every month, and created a link to Mother Earth at each camp by constructing a medicine wheel at the center of camp. The Tabeguache believed that the Pikes Peak region is their home. Their name for Pikes Peak is Tavakiev, meaning sun mountain. Living a nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle, summers were spent in the Pikes Peak area mountains, which was considered by other tribes to be the domain of the Utes. Pikes Peak was a sacred ceremonial area for the Tabeguache Utes, or people of Sun Mountain, including their Sundance grounds and culturally scarred Ponderosa Pines that were used for different purposes, including prayer, burial, peeled-bark medicine, and arborglyphs or message trees. Some of the trees are 800 years old. An endowment was established by the Pikes Peak Historical Society in 2001 to help members of the Ute Nation to return to their homelands around Pikes Peak.

In the fall they would travel Ute Pass and visit the springs where they \\"made offerings to the spirits of the springs for good health and good hunting\\". There were about ten mineral springs, called manitou for the \\"breath of the Great Spirit Manitou\\" believed to have created the bubbles, or \\"effervescence\\", in the spring water. The springs were considered sacred grounds where Native Americans drank and soaked in the mineral water to replenish and heal themselves.

From Ute Pass, Utes journeyed eastward to hunt buffalo. They spent winters in mountain valleys where they were protected from the weather. The North and Middle Parks of present-day Colorado were among favored hunting grounds, due to the abundance of game. John Wesley Powell lived with the Northern Ute People in 1868-69 and he observed: :\\"[the Ute] will never ask to what nation or tribe or body of people another Indian belongs but to ‚Äòwhat land do you belong and how are you land named?‚Äô Thus the very name of the Indian is his title deed to his home and thus it is that these Indians have contended so fiercely for the possession of the soil‚Ä¶His national pride and patriotism, his peace with other tribes, his home and livelihood for his family, all his interests, everything that is dear to him is associated with his country.\\" Mechanoluminescence An Uncompahgre Ute Buffalo rawhide ceremonial rattle filled with quartz crystals.

In 1907, he joined the Italian Liberal Party and in 1913 he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the constituency of his native Val Brembana. In 1919, he was re-elected to the lower house as undersecretary of Economy and was then named minister of Minister of Industry and Commerce in the first Bonomi Cabinet. Belotti took this post for about seven months and after the collapse of the government, he resigned from his post like all the ministers of the Cabinet. After the March on Rome, Belotti briefly supported Benito Mussolini because, like many Italians, he believed in Mussolini the strong man was the only person able to defeat the socialists. From 1923, Belotti opposed fascism and didn't participate in the election of 1924 because his party, the Liberal Party, supported the fascists. In 1930, he was arrested for 20 days for his anti-fascist activities and then deported for some months to Cava dei Tirreni. After that Belotti retired from politics but in 1943 he was forced to flee to Switzerland in order to escape from the Italian Social Republic. He died in exile in 1944.

Along with Carol Shaw (creator of 3-D Tic- Tac-Toe and River Raid), Meninsky was one of three female engineers at Atari, Inc. to develop video game cartridges. She later became an intellectual property lawyer. Background Meninsky's mother was a programmer and Carla learned programming in high school, but she switched from mathematics to neuropsychology and brain modelling at Stanford University. Given her artistic bent, Meninsky was particularly interested in vision and eventually veered back toward programming and a lifelong dream of creating animation tools. She began her college career at Stanford studying math but eventually switched to psychology because it sounded more exciting. She learned basic Fortran in high school from her mother, who was a programmer, and through this built an interest in computer animation. Atari, Inc. Meninsky joined Atari after graduating from Stanford University with a degree in psychology. For the Atari 2600 she wrote the 1980 racing game Dodge 'Em (similar to the 1979 Head On coin-op from Sega), a 1981 port of Atari's Warlords, and the 2600 version of Star Raiders (originally designed by Doug Neubauer for the Atari 8-bit family). She later worked on a port of Tempest that was never released, but prototypes exist. Law practice Meninsky worked for Electronic Arts (EA) and other game publishers and eventually started her own successful contract programming company. In the course of writing contracts and seeing intellectual property rights being ignored by some companies, she became interested in intellectual property law. Meninsky graduated from George Washington University Law School and now practices intellectual property law. As an EPIC Public Interest Opportunities Program Fellow, Meninsky testified before the U.S. Senate in 2002.

History English currency was in disarray in the late 17th century. Hand struck silver coins from prior to 1662 had been clipped around the edges and thus their value (weight) reduced so that they were no longer a viable tender, especially abroad. Since the machine-struck silver coins produced by the Royal Mint in the Tower of London after 1662 were protected from clipping by an engraved, decorated and milled edge, they were instead forged, both by casting from counterfeit moulds and by die stamping from counterfeit dies.BBC Radio 4, Book of the Week, Sept 2009, Newton And The Counterfeiter by Thomas Levenson By 1696 forged coins constituted approximately 10% of the nation's currency. The currency also had a third problem: its value as silver bullion in Paris and Amsterdam was greater than the face value in London, and thus vast quantities of coins were melted and shipped abroad -- an arbitrage market. New Acts of Parliament were passed in order to create the Bank of England and protect national monetary security. The situation caused William Lowndes of the Treasury to ask the warden of the Royal Mint, Isaac Newton, for help. Branch mints were established at Bristol, Chester, Exeter, Norwich, and York to assist with the work of recoinage. Between 1696 and 1700 the value of silver struck was ¬£5,106,019 (¬£ in 2015) compared to ¬£3,302,193 (¬£ in 2015) coined in the preceding 35 years. Old coin was taken back by weight rather than face value. On 10 June 1696 a Proclamation was issued, > requiring all Receivers and Collectors of the Publick Taxes to take hammer'd > Silver Money at five shillings and eight Pence an Ounce.Thomas Salmon, The > Chronological Historian, London 1723, p. 220, 224 Financial results  The recoinage was not a financial success. Production tailed off by 1698. It had proved impossible to maintain a system based on gold and silver because of the variation in the bullion values of each metal. In practice this usually meant that silver was worth more melted down into bullion.The Great Recoinage of 1696-1699, Li, Ming-Hsun, London 1963 England eventually committed itself to a gold standard. The only way to maintain silver as coin was to reduce the silver content so that the coin's nominal value was more than the bullion of the same weight. This did not happen until the Great Recoinage of 1816.

Life Duchambge (Montet) was born in Martinique,Herbert Schneider: \\"Duchambge, (Charlotte-Antoinette-) Pauline\\", in: Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart (MGG), biographical part, vol. 5 (Kassel: B√§renreiter, 2001), cc. 1492‚Äì1495. the daughter of a noble family. She was taken to Paris, where she received a convent education and studied the piano from composer and author Jean-Baptiste Desormery, son of the famous comic opera actor and composer L√©opold-Bastien Desormery. Pauline left the convent in 1792 and married Baron Duchambge in 1796. In 1798 at the age of 20, she lost both her parents and with them the family fortune. Soon afterwards she was divorced. It was after these events that Duchambge's musical education began in earnest. She studied harmony and composition with Daniel Auber and Luigi Cherubini (who wrote several compositions for her) as well as piano and composition with Jan Ladislav Dussek. In 1815, Duchambge met the French poet and novelist, Marceline Desbordes-Valmore beginning a lifelong friendship and collaboration. Their friendship is documented by a lengthy correspondence and a number of songs by Duchambge on Debordes-Valmore's texts including L'Adieu tout bas, La Fianc√©e del marin, Je pense √† lui, La Jeune Ch√¢telaine, R√™ve du mousse, La Sinc√®re, and La Valse et l'automne. Duchambge also composed music to texts and romances of other female authors such as Mme Amble Tastu and Mme Emile De Girardin. Pauline Duchambge wrote over three hundred romances, a very popular genre in the nineteenth century. Auber deposited three hundred of Duchambge's songs in the library of the Paris Conservatoire. Eleven of Duchambge's individual songs and albums of songs were published between 1827 and 1841 by some of the leading Parisian publishers including Meissonnier, Jacques-Joseph Frey, A. Petibon, and Pleyel. Her works reached a German audience through the Berlin publisher Maurice Schlesinger and the Schott firm in Mainz. In addition to songs, Duchambge wrote a few piano pieces. Duchambge had a difficult life, struggling with poverty, delicate health, and the disenchantments of love; her music expresses her emotions. She commented: \\"Love, it is life! but a life full of troubles, illusions, deceptions, repentance, discouragements‚Ä¶. \\" thumb thumb Musical Style Some of Duchambge's songs have been published in the twentieth century in Les Greniers et la guitare de Marceline (1931) and in an anthology of songs (1988). Duchambge's romances were very popular during the first years of the Restoration. She was admired by many poets of her day, setting poems of the leading Romantics including Fran√ßois-Ren√© Chateaubriand and Victor Hugo, and dramatists Casimir Delavigne, Alfred de Vigny, and Eug√®ne Scribe. She also set texts by women such as Mme. Amable Tastu and Mme. √âmile de Girardin. Duchambge chose texts that were often pastoral and expressed love sentiments typical of the early-nineteenth century. The music is strophic and usually without refrains. The simple diatonic melodies have a range of a ninth. Her melodies are often ornamented with grace notes and some accents, and there are a few dynamic markings. Duchambge was sensitive to the words and reflects different moods within a verse. According to F√©tis, the lyric melodies are remarkable for \\"a sweet sensibility and elegance of form.\\" The harmony has an interesting variety of chords, containing modulations and secondary dominants. Duchambge uses major and minor modes in the same song to reflect changing moods. The piano accompaniments use ostinatos, arpeggios, and solid chords. The voice may begin in the first measure, or an introduction may set the mood of the song and establish the tonality. The final four measures of the accompaniment often serve as an interlude to the next verse as well as a coda to the final verse. Detailed aspects The poem La Jalouse (The Jealous One) was first published in Desbordes-Valmore's collection Papillon (1834) under the title La Fuite (The Escape), also in Pauvres Fleurs (1839). The poem has three stanzas of \\"huitains\\" (eight lines). The rhyme scheme of the stanzas is A-B-A-B C-D- C-D. The agitated introduction in C minor, with sixteenth-note triplets, establishes the mood. In the first phrase (bars 5‚Äì12), setting a sad, somber text, the melody begins in a narrow range, harmonised with a C minor broken chord. The melody glides up the scale on \\"glissant,\\" and the phrase ends in E flat major. In verse three, these ascending notes triumphantly proclaim \\"I am the ungrateful one!\\" In the following unstable section (bars 13‚Äì18) in the minor dominant, the melody leaps up and down large intervals, portraying bouncing footsteps (verse 1) and turmoil (verse 2). The melody moves up a seventh to F, harmonised with a dominant-seventh chord, as the text commands \\"Ne fuis pas encore\\" (Do not flee yet). The melody descends, as the words say there is more to be told. One (\\"I am the ungrateful\\") is repeated in an Andantino section (bars 18‚Äì23), set triumphantly in C major with a disjunct line and joyous triplets, leading to a C-minor interlude (bars 23‚Äì26) that sets the mood for the following verse. For verses 2 and 3, Duchambge makes slight adjustments in the rhythm to set the words appropriately. Le Jardin de ma fen√™tre (The Garden by my Window) describes a flower garden and hedgerow in April, and a sailor returning home. The poet, Desbordes-Valmore, loved flowers and decorated the balconies and windows of her apartments with flowers. The poem has four stanzas, huitains, and the rhyme scheme is A-B-A-B C-D-C-D. The first half of the poem (bars 1‚Äì16), beginning without introduction, is set simply with tonic and dominant chords in A flat major. The melody is mostly stepwise, setting a peaceful scene of nature in each verse: the flower garden by the window, the evening swallow returning, the lamp lit for the returning sailor. The middle section (bars 17‚Äì24) is unstable with complex harmonies, leading to a return to the tonic. The melodic line in bars 25‚Äì31 ascends by a fifth, then moves gradually to the tonic as the words describe unsteady plants, a trembling hedgerow (or heart), and a flickering flame. The final melodic line is disjunct, accompanied by a series of secondary dominants, before landing on the tonic. The text reflects on two plants that are separated (representing two people), questions the significance of the returning swallow, and describes the lamp and flowers set out as a beacon for the sailor. The final four bars, serving as an interlude to the following verse, are stable with dominant and tonic chords over a tonic pedal. A new rhythmic figure in sixteenth notes is introduced, giving the song a pleasant motion. Adieu tout (Farewell All), another poem by Desbordes-Valmore, has three stanzas of quatrains in an A-B-B-A rhyme scheme with a two-line refrain. Duchambge's setting begins with an agitated section in F minor with tonic, dominant, and diminished broken chords over a dominant pedal (bars 1‚Äì8). The melody descends stepwise through the minor scale, recalling the sweet memory of love, then leaps up an octave, proclaiming the separation. The three verses are set in F major, with complex harmonies using the submediant, secondary dominants, and diminished chords. The melodic line begins simply with an undulating major third, then ascends a sixth before descending in the D harmonic minor scale. The melody then rises stepwise to E as verses 2 and 3 speak of going to heaven, then descends to the tonic. The final four bars, leading back to the F minor opening, have scales in contrary motion and reaffirm the F-major tonic.\\"Duchambge, Pauline\\", Mugi.com. Musik und Gender im Internet, n.d.

Career Neon Hearts were Wolverhampton's first punk band that had a short lived existence from 1977 to 1981 at the height of the punk movement. The band was founded in the summer of 1977 by Steve Heart when he quit Birmingham-based Suburban Studs after being told a sax player was inappropriate in a punk band. The initial line up included Steve, his cousin, a bass player called Paul Raven, a drummer friend of Paul's, Keith Allen, and Martin Ratcliffe, a guitarist friend of Keith's. After a few weeks rehearsing, the band went into Lee Sound Studios to arrange a demo recording session. They soon came across a solo singer playing local pubs and clubs doing his own songs and a few Bowie covers. Tony Deary (later Tone Dial) joined the band after a couple of meetings and the band (now five members) was complete. After much debate the band decided to call themselves Neon Hearts. After the first sessions at Ginger Studios two songs, 'Regulations' and 'Venus Eccentric' were chosen to become a double A-sided single released on 1 December 1977 on the band's own label, Neon Hearts Records. The first pressing of the single was released in an oversized 8\\" sleeve due to a printing error. Throughout this period record company interest increased, but was narrowed down to two main candidatesThe band signed to Satril, a satellite company of WEA, in May 1978. From day one problems occurred Satril attempting to get the band to move into a more 'funky' direction and submit material to the Eurovision song contest. Being optimistic, Neon Hearts felt things would improve however, things worsened and they ended up trying to make the best of a bad job. The first demos for Satril were recorded at PYE Studios in London on 6 June 1978 under the supervision of A&R; manager Paul Jenkins. The band wanted to release 'Popular Music' as their Satril debut, but they were overruled by the label that chose 'Answers', which was released late July 1978. The single was given no promotion by Satril so the band self-promoted it by gigging. Satril agreed to release 'Popular Music' as the second single. In preparation for promoting the album the band appeared on Look! Hear!, a TV music show that was screened on BBC Midlands, in January 1980. They performed the new single \\"Popular Music\\" and \\"Synchronisation\\", a song that was never recorded elsewhere. Neon Hearts Mk II The band recorded a John Peel Session on 21 March at the Maida Vale Studios in London. The tracks were \\"Roll-On Deodorant\\", \\"Rings of Confidence\\", a re-working of \\"Body Language\\" and \\"The Other Great Sex Pros (Airborne Hormones)\\". Neon Hearts Mk III and Silhouette Theatre In late 1980 Steve and Tony decided to reform Neon Hearts. The same year, Tony released an EP, You Keep Coming Round, with a new band, Silhouette Theatre. The material was strong but inadequate distribution and airplay meant it achieved little commercial success. Dial subsequently joined Birmingham group Fashion for a period. Final Chapter By chance the five band members met up in August 2002 and ended up recording two new songs written by Tony, \\"Retrograde\\" and \\"Heart of Darkness\\". This was the last time the band played together due to the tragic death of bass player Paul Raven in October 2007. Paul had become a highly influential musician best known for his work in the seminal punk/goth/metal/electronic group Killing Joke. He later played in the alternative rock/industrial rock bands Prong & Ministry. Tony Dial later changed his name to Vael Deary and is now writing songs towards entertaining an audience. Vael won't do the retro thing with the Neon Hearts. He's busy playing to unsuspecting audiences across the UK. Re-releases A compilation CD called Ball & Chain was released by Overground records in 1997. This included alternate versions of songs on the Popular Music album, the John Peel session and a number of other previously unreleased recordings. Based on the success of this CD Overground re-released The Popular Music album in CD format in 2002. Neon Japan In November 2011 a nine-track Neon Hearts Tribute CD was released in Japan on the Simply Thrilling label. The project was the brainchild of record producer and promoter Miles Wood, who is based in the Far East and picked up on the band's popularity in Japan. In an interview with Junk Archive Miles recalled, \\"The idea came to me after Nervous Hearts (a side project of The Fadeaways) played a cover of \\"Answers\\" at a show I organised in Yokohama. I knew there were some Neon Hearts fans in Japan and among those were a few musicians in bands that I worked with. So I mentioned the idea to Nervous Hearts‚Äô vocalist if they would be interested in recording \\"Answers\\" for a Neon Hearts tribute EP or album; he said yes, and thought it was a good idea so I started asking other bands. My first question was always \\"Do you know and like Neon Hearts?\\" and I got some excited responses. Sometimes I would mention the idea to someone in passing and was surprised to hear them say \\"I love Neon Hearts!\\" and so I would immediately invite them on board.\\" Miles continues how he then decided to get the original band to endorse and support the idea. \\"Luckily with the world as it is today I was able to do so from the opposite side of the globe. I told them of my idea, and asked if they would also like to come on board and mix and master the album. They gave me the green light and also accepted the offer. There was some discussion of a possible Neon Hearts Japanese Tour to coincide, but ultimately it has come down to Keith and Martin travelling to Japan for the album release gigs and playing with the bands on their respective cover versions and a few Neon Hearts classics as well. I‚Äôm not unhappy with this as I didn‚Äôt want them to be seen as some kind of \\"cabaret act\\" as some of the reformed 70‚Ä≤s punk bands are in danger of being. To me, it‚Äôs important that while there‚Äôs an obvious element of nostalgia involved, it remains very much contemporary.\\" The cover is an 8-inch cardboard sleeve in homage to the unique-size \\"Regulations\\" one. The front design is, of course, adapted from that, while the back design reference one commonly found on the back of ‚Äòsukejan‚Äô ‚Äì Japanese souvenir jackets initially popular with US military personnel in the 1950s.

Those in poverty have a higher chance of experiencing the ill-effects climate change due to increased exposure and vulnerability. Vulnerability represents the degree to which a system is susceptible to, or unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change including climate variability and extremes. Climate change's health, economic impacts, and human rights impacts exacerbate existing environmental inequities. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth National Climate Assessment Report found that low-income individuals and communities are more exposed to environmental hazards and pollution and have a harder time recovering from the impacts of climate change. For example, it takes longer for low-income communities to rebuild after natural disasters. According to the United Nations Development Programme, developing countries suffer 99% of the casualties attributable to climate change. Climate change raises some climate ethics issues, as the least 50 developed countries of the world account for an imbalanced 1% contribution to the worldwide emissions of greenhouse gasses which are theorized to be attributable to global warming. Climate justice and distributive justice questions are central to climate change policy options. Many of the policy tools often employed to solve environmental problems, such as cost-benefit analysis, usually do not adequately deal with these issues because they often ignore questions of just distribution and the effects on human rights. Connection to poverty The cycle of poverty exacerbates the potential negative impacts of climate change. This phenomenon is defined when poor families become trapped in poverty for at least three generations and when they have limited or no access to resources and are disadvantaged in means of breaking the cycle. While in rich countries, coping with climate change has largely been a matter of adjusting thermostats, dealing with longer, hotter summers, and observing seasonal shifts; for those in poverty, weather-related disasters, a bad harvest, or even a family member falling ill can provide crippling economic shocks.United Nations Development Programme. 2006. \\"Human Development Report: Beyond Scarcity: Power, Poverty, and the Global Water Crisis.\\" New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006. (pp. 25‚Äì199). Besides these economic shocks, the widespread famine, drought, and potential humanistic shocks could affect the entire nation. High levels of poverty and low levels of human development limit capacity of poor households to manage climate risks. With limited access to formal insurance, low incomes and meager assets, poor households have to deal with climate-related shocks under highly constrained conditions.IPCC. 2001. Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, Contribution of Working Group II of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to the Third Assessment Report of the IPCC. Online at www.ipcc.ch (Accessed October 23, 2010)  Relationship to environmental racism   Reversing development  Climate change is globally encompassing and can reverse development in some areas in the following ways.  Agricultural production and food security  There has been considerable research comparing the interrelated processes of climate change and agriculture.IPCC. 2007. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (Accessed on November 2, 2010). Climate change will affect rainfall, temperature, and water availability for agriculture in vulnerable areas. Climate change could affect agriculture in several ways including productivity, agricultural practices, environmental effects, and distribution of rural space.Schneider, S.H. et al. (2007). \\"Assessing key vulnerabilities and the risk from climate change. In: Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability. Contribution of Working Group II to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [M.L. Parry et al. (eds.)\\"]. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, U.K., and New York, N.Y., U.S.A.. pp. 779‚Äì810. Retrieved 2009-05-20. Additional number affected by malnutrition could rise to 600 million by 2080. Climate change could worsen the prevalence of hunger through direct negative effects on production and indirect impacts on purchasing powers.  Water insecurity  Of the 3 billion growth in population projected worldwide by the mid-21st century, the majority will be born in countries already experiencing water shortages. As the overall climate of the earth warms, changes in the nature of global rainfall, evaporation, snow, and runoff flows will be affected.Miller, Kathleen. 1997. Climate Variability, Climate Change and Western Water. Report to the Western Water Policy Review Advisory Commission, NTIS, Springfield, VA. http://www.isse.ucar.edu/water_climate/impacts.html (Accessed on November 2, 2010) Safe water sources are essential for survival within a community. Manifestations of the projected water crisis include inadequate access to safe drinking water for about 884 million people as well as inadequate access to water for sanitation and water disposal for 2.5 billion people.Updated Numbers: WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation Updated Report. 2008. http://www.unicef.org/media/media_44093.html, 25  Rising sea levels and exposure to climate disasters  Sea levels could rise rapidly with accelerated ice sheet disintegration. Global temperature increases of 3‚Äì4 degrees C could result in 330 million people being permanently or temporarily displaced through flooding Warming seas will also fuel more intense tropical storms.  Ecosystems and biodiversity  Climate change is already transforming ecological systems. Around one-half of the world's coral reef systems have suffered bleaching as a result of warming seas. In addition, the direct human pressures that might be experienced include overfishing which could lead to resource depletion, nutrient and chemical pollution and poor land use practices such as deforestation and dredging. Also, climate change may increase the amount of arable land in high- latitude regions by reduction of the amount of frozen lands. A 2005 study reports that temperature in Siberia has increased three degree Celsius in average since 1960, which is reportedly more than in other areas of the world.Sample, Ian. \\"Warming hits ‚Äòtipping point‚Äô\\" The Guardian. August 11, 2005. (Accessed on November 12, 2010).  Human health  A direct effect is increase in temperature-related illnesses and deaths related to prolonged heat waves and humidity. Climate change could also change the geographic range of vector-borne, specifically mosquito-borne disease such as malaria dengue fever exposing new populations to the disease. Because a changing climate affects the essential ingredients of maintaining good health: clean air and water, sufficient food and adequate shelter, the effects could be widespread and pervasive. The report of the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health points out that disadvantaged communities are likely to shoulder a disproportionate share of the burden of climate change because of their increased exposure and vulnerability to health threats.World Health Organization. 2004. The Global Burden Disease: 2004 Update. http://who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/2004_report_update/en/index.htm Over 90 percent of malaria and diarrhea deaths are borne by children aged 5 years or younger, mostly in developing countries. Other severely affected population groups include women, the elderly and people living in small island developing states and other coastal regions, mega-cities or mountainous areas. Human rights and democracy In June 2019, United Nations Special Rapporteur Philip Alston warned of a \\"climate apartheid\\" where the rich pay to escape the effects of climate change while the rest of the world suffers, potentially undermining basic human rights, democracy, and even the rule of law. When Superstorm Sandy struck in 2012, he recounts, most people in New York City were left without power, while the Goldman Sachs headquarters had a private generator and protection by \\"tens of thousands of its own sandbags\\".  Security impacts  The concept of Human security and the effects that climate change may have on it will become increasingly important as the changes become more apparent.Liotta, Peter. \\"Climate Change and Human Security: The Use of Scenarios\\" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Studies Association, Town & Country Resort and Convention Center, San Diego, California, USA, Mar 22, 2006. 2009-05-25 Some effects are already evident and will become very clear in the human and climatic short run (2007‚Äì2020). They will increase and others will manifest themselves in the medium term (2021‚Äì2050); whilst in the long run (2051‚Äì2100), they will all be active and interacting strongly with other major trends. There is the potential for the end of the petroleum economy for many producing and consuming nations, possible financial and economic crisis, a larger population of humans, and a much more urbanized humanity ‚Äì far in excess of the 50% now living in small to very large cities.Simon, David. (2007), \\"Cities and Global Environmental Change: Exploring the Links,\\" The Geographical Journal 173, 1 (March): 75‚Äì79 & see chapters 3 & 4 of Sir Nicholas Stern et al. (2007) Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change. London: UK, Department of the Treasury http://www.hm- treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/stern_review_report.cfm All these processes will be accompanied by redistribution of population nationally and internationally. Such redistributions typically have significant gender dimensions; for example, extreme event impacts can lead to male out migration in search of work, culminating in an increase in women- headed households ‚Äì a group often considered particularly vulnerable.Delaney and Elizabeth Shrader (2000) \\"Gender and Post-Disaster Reconstruction: The Case of Hurricane Mitch in Honduras and Nicaragua\\", LCSPG/LAC Gender Team, The World Bank, Decision Review Draft, page 24 http://www.gdnonline.org/resources/reviewdraft.doc Indeed, the effects of climate change on impoverished women and children is crucial in that women and children in particular, have unequal human capabilities.UNICEF. 2007. Climate Change and Children. New York: United Nations Children‚Äôs Fund. p. 47  Infrastructure impacts  The potential effects of climate change and the security of infrastructure will have the most direct effect on the poverty cycle. Areas of infrastructure effects will include water systems, housing and settlements, transport networks, utilities, and industry.Jabeen, Huraera and Fuad H. Mallick. \\"Urban Poverty, climate change and built environment.\\" The Daily Star. January 24, 2009. Infrastructure designers can contribute in three areas for improving living environment for the poor, in building design, in settlement planning and design as well as in urban planning. The National Research Council has identified five climate changes of particular importance to infrastructure and factors that should be taken into consideration when designing future structures. These factors include: increases in very hot days and heat waves, increases in Arctic temperatures, rising sea levels, increases in intense precipitation events, and increases in hurricane intensity.O‚ÄôLeary, Maureen. March 21, 2008. Climate Change on Infrastructure. http://scitizen.com/climate-change/climate-change-on- infrastructure_a-13-1788.html (Accessed on November 2, 2010). Accordingly, transportation decision makers continually make short- and long-term investment decisions that affect how infrastructure will respond to climate change.  Proposed policy solutions   Mitigation efforts  Climate change mitigation is the action to decrease the intensity of radiative forcing in order to reduce the potential effects of global warming. Most often, mitigation efforts involve reductions in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, either by reducing their source or by increasing their sinks.  Adaptation efforts  Adaptation to global warming involves actions to tolerate the effects of global warming. Collaborative research from the Institute of Development Studies draws links between adaptation and poverty to help develop an agenda for pro-poor adaptation that can inform climate- resilient poverty reduction. Adaptation to climate change will be \\"ineffective and inequitable if it fails to learn and build upon an understanding of the multidimensional and differentiated nature of poverty and vulnerability\\".IDS Bulletin. Poverty in a Changing Climate IDS Bulletin 39(4):2, September 2008 Poorer countries tend to be more seriously affected by climate change, yet have reduced assets and capacities with which to adapt. This has led to more activities to integrate adaptation within development and poverty reduction programs. The rise of adaptation as a development issue has been influenced by concerns around minimizing threats to progress on poverty reduction, notably the Millennium Development Goals, and by the injustice of impacts that are felt hardest by those who have done least to contribute to the problem, framing adaptation as an equity and human rights issue.  Proposed policy challenges  Most difficult policy challenge is related to distribution. While this is a potential catastrophic risk for the entire globe, the short and medium-term distribution of the costs and benefits will be far from uniform. Distribution challenge is made particularly difficult because those who have largely caused the problem ‚Äì richer nations ‚Äì are not going to be those who suffer the most in the short term. It is the poorest who did not and still are not contributing significantly to greenhouse gas emissions that are the most vulnerable.La Trobe, S. 2002.

It is a registered non- profit California corporation, with IRS 501(c)(3) charitable status. It describes itself as \\"a space for sharing, creation, collaboration, research, development, mentoring, and learning\\" and outside of its headquarters forms a wider community around the world. It was organized in 2007 and has had permanent facilities since 2008.  Membership  Noisebridge encourages participation by anyone who feels they can contribute, and non-members are welcome at the space at any time. All workshops and activities are free, with some exceptions for materials costs, and all are open to the public. Noisebridge members have been involved with research projects that won the best paper awards from top tier academic conferences such as Usenix Security Conference and CRYPTO.  Media coverage  Noisebridge won the SF Bay Guardian 2010 Best of the Bay award as \\"Best Open Source Playground\\"; the review concluded, \\"the vibe is welcoming and smart.\\" In 2011 the SF Weekly awarded Noisebridge Best of San Francisco as \\"Best Hacker Playground\\", describing it as \\"the ultimate in DIY ethic\\" and noting its \\"distinctive sense of humor.\\" Noisebridge has been covered by international media for a myriad of projects involving their membership, including NPR, the BBC, the BBC World Service, Wired, The New Yorker, The Guardian, CNET, Le Monde, Heise Online, ORF, Irish Times, Die Welt Online, Die Zeit Online, Der Standard, and elsewhere. The hackerspace features prominently in Cory Doctorow's fictional 2013 novel Homeland, and influenced Annalee Newitz's novel Autonomous, which was partially written at Noisebridge.  Physical space  Noisebridge has been located at 2169 Mission Street, a 5200-square-foot commercial space in San Francisco's Mission District, since 2009. The current space has many workspaces, which change dynamically. As of June 2018 these include: * Machine shop which includes a 100W laser cutter * Wood shop * Two classrooms * 2D/3D printing shop with CNC vinyl cutter * 1Gbit/s Internet uplink * Sewing and textile workshop * Electronics shop with SMD capabilities * Modular synthesizer workshop * VR system with green screen * Digital Audio Workstation * Library of paper books * Book scanning workshop * Vintage video game archive and arcade cabinet * Photobooth * Sofas for laptop work and socializing During most of 2007 and 2008, Noisebridge was a group of people meeting in new locations weekly. In October 2008 the Noisebridge group began renting a commercial property in San Francisco's Mission District but it quickly outgrew that location. Past workspaces prior to June 2018 include * Optics lab, * Mycology lab * Biotech lab * Kitchen * Photo development darkroom * A lights- out cloud computing lab with more than 100 computer cores and contributed resources to several open source projects, including the GCC compile farm  Community participation  Arduinos for beginners workshop, July 2011 Noisebridge members regularly speak at events around the world such as Defcon, Blackhat, The Chaos Computer Club's Chaos Communication Congress, CCC Camps, HOPE, and more, as well as present at local events such as Maker Faire, and contribute to the founding of hackerspaces elsewhere. It is well known for its Five Minutes Of Fame event as well as hosting the local San Francisco Dorkbot and monochrom's sex-tech conference Arse Elektronika. Furthermore, Noisebridge is a member of the torservers.net network, an organization of nonprofits which specializes in the general establishment of Tor anonymity network exit nodes via workshops and donations.  Spacebridge  The \\"Spacebridge\\" weather balloon probe above clouds, in February 2010 Noisebridge had a near space exploration program, which launched weather-balloon probes exploring altitudes of nearly 70,000 feet, carrying a variety of smartphones and digital cameras for imaging and altitude sensing using a GPS system. Altitudes reached have exceeded the operational limits of consumer level GPS systems.  NoiseTor  NoiseTor (or Noisebridge Tor Project) is a Noisebridge initiative to create and operate additional Tor relays. The project accepts financial donations to sponsor additional nodes.  Controversies  Many women have reported instances of being sexually harassed and assaulted at Noisebridge. Co-founder Jacob Appelbaum admitted to multiple instances of sexual harassment and assault and is likely a serial offender. In 2016, he was banned from Noisebridge.

Biography Mlle Duval, whose first name is unknown, was a French composer and dancer who was an accomplished harpsichordist. A letter to the Journal des nouvelles de Paris in 1736 reported she was known by the name La L√©gende because she was an illegitimate child, possibly indicating that Duval was a stage name. She may be the same person as an 18th-century French composer who is identified as Louise Duval (1704‚Äì69), though their birth and death dates do not appear to match up. Much of what is known about Mlle Duval's life comes from mentions in contemporary accounts; for instance, her birth date is deduced from a letter stating that she was 18 in 1736, the year she composed her best-known work, the opera ballet Les G√©nies, ou Les caract√®res de l'Amour (Geniuses, or Love's Characters). The libretto of Les G√©nies, which was written in the heroic ballet style, was by Fleury de Lyon, and its publication was sponsored by the Prince of Carignan. Les G√©nies premiered at the Paris Opera in October 1736, becoming only the second opera by a woman to be performed at the Opera; the first had been by Jacquet de la Guerre forty years earlier. It ran for nine performances, with the music being praised by critics as well composed and its composer singled out as a \\"young person with much talent\\". A review in the Mercure de France reported that she accompanied the full performance of her opera on harpsichord. Another of her compositions is the duet Du Dieu qui fait aimer (Of God Who Causes Love), which was published in 1736. However, an air, Tout ce que je vois me rappelle (Everything I See Reminds Me), which has been attributed to her, is now thought to be by Marie-Elizabeth Cl√©ry. One source states that she performed at the Acad√©mie Royale de Musique and retired with a substantial pension, while another notes her as a former actress and supernumerary dancer with the Paris Opera. However, as the name Duval is a common one in France, it is not certain that all such references are to the composer. Mlle Duval's death date is uncertain; one account has her dying as early as 1769, but a more detailed account has her alive in 1775.

This technology was pioneered by a scientist from Center for Infection and Immunity (CII) of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, USA. Principles Like conventional PCR, MassTag-PCR uses primer pairs. The difference is primers used for MassTag PCR are tagged with molecules of known masses or MassCodes. Instead of single pair of primers this technology uses a number of primers, making it a multiplex system. Unlike, conventional Multiplex PCR system, in MassTag PCR more than 15 primer pairs could be used. If DNA from any of the agent of primer panel is present, it will be amplified. Each amplified product will carry its specific Masscodes. The PCR product is then purified to remove unbound primers, dNTPs, enzyme and other impurities. Finally, the purified PCR products are subjected to UV light as the chemical bond between the nucleic acids and primers is photolabile. As the Masscodes are liberated from PCR products they are detected with a Mass Spectrometer. Presence of specific MassCode indicates the presence of specific pathogen. Applications This technique has been found to detect a previously uncharacterized clade of rhinovirus. MassTag PCR is a more comprehensive and sensitive diagnostic technique, CII was able to determine the cause of this illness for 26 out of 79 previously unknown cases. MassTag PCR demonstrated its tripartite value as a tool for surveillance, outbreak detection, and epidemiology.

Description The sculpture, which looks like a sea creature, comprises numerous tentacles of varying lengths that stream up and out from a main stem. The stem is mounted on a rectangular base made of Indiana limestone (approx. 83 x 20 x 20 in.) and weighs 400 lbs.

THE BENCH-BASE ON WHICH THE :SCULPTURE RESTS IS MADE OF INDIANA LIMESTONE. Information The board of the Jefferson Township Library commissioned Barney Bright to make the sculpture for their new library. The sculpture, which cost $7,500, was originally located on a limestone bench fifteen feet from its current location. Between 1977 and early 1978 it was moved and installed on a higher base to help prevent vandalism. The museum was renovated in 2007 and the sculpture was moved inside and placed within one of the many fountains (representing the Falls) that were built. Bright describes the sculpture as representing the Devonian time period, which is the era when the Falls of the Ohio were being formed. According to the SOS! survey the sculpture \\" the tentacled sculpture represents life reaching out for the sea and covering the earth.\\" Local controversy ensued due to the scientific nature of the sculpture upon its installation. In 2007, the News and Tribune described the sculpture fountain as contributing to a \\"relaxing atmosphere\\" at the library. References External links *Jeffersonville Public Library.

Frank Packard from Columbus, Ohio was hired as the architect and construction began in 1909. The building was inspired by Classical Roman architecture and when it opened in 1910, it consisted of a main reading room for 192 people, a periodical room, a few classrooms, faculty rooms a multi-tier stacks for 150,000 volumes. Building extensions By the end of 1911 all the shelf space for the library was full and planning began for an addition to the building. In 1922 funding from the university and the Carnegie Corporation enable an Eastern wing designed by Ralph Ridley to be added to the existing building. This addition included a main reference room, reading room and more stacks. The next addition that came in 1951 where a West wing was added to the building, thus making it once again symmetrical. Designed by Potter Tyler & Martin this addition was funded by the State of Ohio and added more stacks to the building. At the completion of King Library, the university's current main library, in 1972, the university's Department of Architecture took residence in the building. In 1997 Thomas H.

The pinball machine was initially supposed to be released as Batman pinball, the police car was to be the Batmobile and the Jail was to be the Bat Cave. The machine features anthropomorphic jungle animals in the roles of police and robbers. The game features scoring by hitting each of the targets of the animals. As the targets of each animal are struck, a light of each lights up showing them in jail. The game also features scoring on a center ramp with unlimited shots of one million each after a series of shots, and a multi-ball. On the third ball of the game, players can shoot the right ramp twice, and add the highest current score to their own. Rules The game features anthropomorphic jungle animals in the roles of cops and robbers, and stars a lion and leopard as the two main police officers the player assumes the role of when playing the game. The object of the game is to arrest the four main criminals and then score the progressive jackpot. Firing Range (Skill Shot) When starting the game, use the plunger to shoot the ball and score a randomly selected value between 10,000 and 100,000 points, determined by hitting a special target spinner. If the ball doesn't reach the spinner, it will drop back into the handcuff bonus trap, and the player scores 10,000 multiplied by the number of the ball in play (i.e. 10,000 x Ball 2, which is 20,000). GUN Rollovers At the top of the playfield are three rollovers that spell out G-U-N. Spelling the word GUN advances the bonus multiplier (which caps off at 6X), and allows the jackpot to increase for 10 seconds; when the ball hits any bumpers or target, the jackpot increases. Bonus is multiplied by lighting all three G-U-N lanes (lit lanes change with flippers). When the multiplier increases, the jackpot is increased by all targets for a period of time. The end of ball bonus is then multiplied by whatever the multiplier is up to. On most games, the multiplier is carried over to subsequent balls if it is 2X or 3X. If the multiplier is above 3X, then it is reset to 1X on the next ball. Special is lit when the multiplier is maxed out (6X), and the player spells GUN again. Criminal Targets There are four specific criminals to arrest: the loan shark, the machine gun crocodile, the diamond weasel, and the drug rat. The shark, rat, and weasel can all be arrested by hitting all three proper targets with each animal. The shark's targets are on the left, while the weasel's are on the right, and the rat's targets are close to the center of the table next to the right ramp. To arrest the crocodile, shoot the ball into the Hot Sheet ball trap. Lights within the characters' bodies flash until they are arrested. Once all four criminals are in jail, the player is eligible to score the jackpot, and the process resets. Handcuff Bonus Shoot the Handcuff target on the right side of the playfield (indicated by a flashing green arrow placed just under the weasel's targets) to score a handcuff bonus. The bonus can either be an incremental score, or 10,000 points times the number of the ball in play if the ball hits the trap from the plunger. Hot Sheet Value Scores one of five values when lit at the Croc kickout: Hot Score (mystery), Hot Extra Ball, 5 Free Games, Spot P-O-L-I-C-E, and Hot Multi-Ball. Hot Multi- Ball is only awarded if one ball is already locked. Shooting this trap also puts the crocodile in jail if he hasn't been arrested already. Jackpot Contrary to other pinball machines, Jackpot can be collected without the need of Multi-Ball. To light the Jackpot on the right ramp, all four criminals must be put in jail (Croc, Shark, Rat, and Weasel). Criminals in jail are indicated in the upper left part of the playfield above the Croc Kickout. When all four are incarcerated, Jackpot is lit and is collected by one shot up the right ramp. Value ranges from a minimum of 1,000,000 to a maximum of 4,000,000 and is increased for a period of time (10 seconds) after G-U-N is spelled. The player has only 15 seconds after arresting the last criminal to win the jackpot. When it is won, it resets to 1 million points. Multi-Ball Contrary to other pinball machines, Multi-Ball has no special features attached to it, because it is not necessary to have Multi-Ball active in order to win the Jackpot. To activate multi-ball, shoot the ball up the right ramp when lock is lit. At the start of the game, the lock is lit to begin with; on subsequent multi-ball attempts, the player needs to first arrest a criminal before activating the lock. When the lock is not lit, shooting the ball up the right ramp instead spots a letter in the word \\"POLICE.\\" Shooting the ball up the ramp a second time (or hitting the Croc kickout after one ball is locked) starts Multi-Ball. P-O-L-I-C-E Letters Letters are spotted by shooting the right ramp when lock is not lit, with a 75K Skill Shot, or from the Hot Sheet. Spotting all 6 letters lights the TOP COP BONUS (collected at the top of the playfield in a half-orbit shot that leads to the GUN rollovers) for 3,000,000 points. TOP COP stays lit until collected or the end of the current ball, whichever comes first. Letters can also be lit during multi-ball when shooting one of the two balls up the right ramp. Unlimited Millions The middle ramp offers large bonuses if consecutive shots are made. The first shot is worth 50,000 points; to score successive shots, the player must make the ramp shot again within a short time and without hitting any targets, bumpers, or rollovers. The successive shots if done successfully score 75,000 points, 100,000, 150,000, and then 1 million points each time in succession (the unlimited millions). After an unlimited million is scored, the TOP COP bonus is lit once the ramp shot is missed or the time expires. Players can also win an extra ball at the TOP COP target when the unlimited millions is lit. Take Highest Score On the last ball only, shooting the ball up the right ramp twice adds the highest score achieved up to that point in the game (and only that game) to the player's own score; the player is only allowed one opportunity at this once the first shot has been made, however; hitting any other targets or going up the wrong section counts as a miss. If an extra ball is earned, the player gets another chance at taking the highest score if it wasn't achieved. If only one player is playing, this essentially doubles the player's score if done correctly.

Haitian trafficking victims are most likely to migrate to The Bahamas voluntarily, but subsequently be subjected to forced labor in agriculture, domestic service, or forced prostitution. Some employers coerce migrant workers ‚Äì legal and illegal ‚Äì to work longer hours, at lower pay, and in conditions not permitted under local labor law by changing the terms of employment contracts, withholding travel documents, refusing transportation back home, threatening to withdraw the employer-specific and employer-held permits, or threatening to have the employee deported through other means. Traffickers reportedly lure Jamaican and other foreign women to the Bahamas with offers of employment in the tourism and entertainment fields and subject the women to forced prostitution after their arrival. The Ministry of Education is investigating allegations that some high school girls in Eleuthera may be involved in a prostitution ring. This report is the only indication that Bahamian citizens may be victims of human trafficking.\\"The Bahamas\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). According to the U.S. government, the Government of the Bahamas does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. During the year, the government began some investigations into suspected cases of trafficking but did not proactively identify victims among vulnerable populations, such as women and girls engaged in prostitution, and it continued to deport undocumented migrants without first determining whether they may be victims of trafficking. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 1\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Government of The Bahamas demonstrated minimal anti-human trafficking law enforcement efforts during the reporting period. It continued to face relevant resource and capacity constraints, and confronted multiple competing law enforcement priorities. All forms of trafficking are prohibited through the Trafficking in Persons Prevention and Suppression Act of 2008. Penalties prescribed by the Act for trafficking in persons offenses range from three years to life imprisonment, and are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The government did not arrest or prosecute any trafficking offenders, despite reports of the presence of trafficking victims in The Bahamas since at least 2005. During the reporting period, the government began investigating one suspected trafficking case in cooperation with another government. The Ministry of Education formed a task force to investigate allegations of a student prostitution ring at a high school in Eleuthera. NGOs, in partnership with the Bahamian government, provided immigration, labor, social services, and law enforcement personnel with anti-trafficking training. Historically, government personnel have conflated human trafficking and human smuggling, leading to the routine deportation of foreigners in vulnerable populations without determining whether they may be trafficking victims. Although the practice continued to some extent, automatic deportations have decreased as official awareness of trafficking as a form of transnational crime has increased. Anecdotal reports indicate that during 2009 some military personnel may have been involved in assisting with the illegal entry of trafficking victims into the country. There is no evidence of government involvement in or tolerance of trafficking. Protection The Bahamian government showed minimal efforts to protect victims of trafficking over the last year. Although the Ministry of Labor and Social Development‚Äôs Bureau of Women‚Äôs Affairs became the lead agency for anti-trafficking training and assistance to victims, the government continued to rely on NGOs and international organizations to identify and provide most services to victims. No specialized shelters for trafficking victims were available in The Bahamas. Shelter services, counseling, and law enforcement referrals were accessible to women and child trafficking victims through the Crisis Centre, which focuses on assisting victims of sexual and domestic abuse. The Red Cross, the Salvation Army, and local church groups which provide assistance to illegal migrants could assist foreign men who may be victims of labor trafficking. Assistance providers did not knowingly assist any trafficking victims during the reporting period. Officials followed no formal procedures for screening or referring victims to service providers. The government developed but has not yet implemented a plan to refer victims to the Bureau of Women‚Äôs Affairs, the Crisis Centre, and the Eugene Dupuch Law School. During the year, the government arranged for the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to conduct victim assistance training for immigration, labor, social services, law enforcement and NGO participants. The ministers responsible for national security and social services, however, did not develop or implement a plan to provide appropriate services to victims in cooperation with NGOs, as required by the anti-trafficking law of 2008. Although the government ensured that victims brought to its attention were not inappropriately penalized for immigration violations and any unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked, some victims were not properly identified. No formal procedures exist that allow law enforcement officers time to investigate whether foreign women found engaging in prostitution may be victims of sex trafficking before the law requires that they be deported. As more immigration and police officers received training in trafficking issues throughout the year, however, the number of officers who first attempted to determine whether foreign women found engaging in prostitution could be victims of trafficking before considering them eligible for deportation increased. The Bahamas‚Äô law encourages victims to participate in investigations and prosecutions of trafficking offenders, and includes provisions for victims‚Äô immunity from prosecution, the protection of victims and witnesses with special considerations for the age and extent of trauma suffered by the victim, and relief from the removal of foreign victims to countries where they may face hardship or retribution regardless of their participation in the investigation or prosecution of their traffickers. Under this law, traffickers are required to financially compensate their victims. Prevention The government demonstrated some efforts to prevent trafficking over the reporting period. The government participated in information and education campaigns conducted in partnership with organizations such as IOM. An ad hoc governmental working group of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Department of Immigration, the Ministry of Labor and Social Development‚Äôs Bureau of Women‚Äôs Affairs, and NGO representatives met periodically to address and coordinate trafficking issues among the various government ministries. This group shifted its focus from immigration enforcement to an emphasis on victim outreach and punishment of perpetrators over the last year. To address the vulnerability of some migrant workers to labor exploitation, the government expedited the processing of immigration claims and granted citizenship to certain long-time residents. The government made no visible effort to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts.

Men and women from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Ethiopia, and Eritrea migrate voluntarily to Bahrain to work as domestic workers or as unskilled laborers in the construction and service industries. Some, however, face conditions of forced labor after arriving in Bahrain, through use of such practices as unlawful withholding of passports, restrictions on movement, contract substitution, non-payment of wages, threats, and physical or sexual abuse. A study by the Bahrain Government's Labor Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA) found that 65 percent of migrant workers had not seen their employment contract, and that 89 percent were unaware of their terms of employment upon arrival in Bahrain. Many labor recruitment agencies in Bahrain and source countries require workers to pay high recruitment fees ‚Äì a practice that makes workers highly vulnerable to forced labor once in Bahrain. The LMRA study found that 70 percent of foreign workers borrowed money or sold property in their home countries in order to secure a job in Bahrain. Some Bahraini employers illegally charge workers exorbitant fees to remain in Bahrain working for third-party employers (under the ‚Äúfree visa‚Äù arrangement). The LMRA estimates that approximately 10 percent of migrant workers were in Bahrain under illegal ‚Äúfree visa‚Äù arrangements ‚Äì a practice that can contribute to debt bondage ‚Äì while the Bahrain Chamber of Commerce and Industry puts the figure at 25 percent. Women from Thailand, the Philippines, Morocco, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Russia, China, Vietnam and Eastern European States are subjected to forced prostitution in Bahrain.\\"Bahrain\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The Government of Bahrain does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government reported its second and third prosecutions under its anti-trafficking statute, and continued to educate potential trafficking victims on their rights. However, the government did not show evidence of progress in providing protective services to victims or prosecuting offenses related to labor trafficking, the most prevalent form of trafficking in Bahrain. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017, having been classified in Tier 3 during the 2007 report. It was elevated to Tier 2 after the report noted the significant improvement particularly in satisfying the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. By 2010, it remained in the Tier 2 category but the watch list designation was dropped. There are sectors within the country that views the human trafficking report and the initiative to improve the performance against human tracking as an intrusion to Bahrain's domestic affairs. On the other hand, there are also those who argue that these commitments allow Bahrain to burnish its credentials as a model state in the Middle East, particularly with respect to its responses to the human tracking problem. Prosecution The Government of Bahrain made some progress in conducting anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts during the year. The 2008 Law to Combat Trafficking in Persons prohibits all forms of trafficking in persons and prescribes penalties ranging from three to 15 years‚Äô imprisonment, which are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The Bahrain government reported two new prosecutions and one new investigation under the anti-trafficking law in the reporting period; all three of these cases involved sex trafficking. One of the prosecutions involved a Bahraini employee of the Ministry of Interior and a Thai national accused of trafficking Asian women into prostitution. The other involved a Bahraini and a Russian national accused of trafficking Russian women. Furthermore, two Bahraini nationals were sentenced to life imprisonment in April and October 2009 for murdering their Indonesian and Ethiopian housemaids, respectively; the government reported that these cases contained elements of human trafficking. The government did not criminally prosecute any employers or labor agents for forced labor of migrant laborers, including domestic workers. There is some indication that government officials may be involved in human trafficking. NGOs and laborers assert that Bahraini officials provide Bahrainis with authorization to sponsor more expatriate workers than they could reasonably employ, and that in their private capacities, some officials illegally engage in ‚Äúfree visa‚Äù arrangements and withhold employees‚Äô passports and salaries. The Royal Police Academy provided new police recruits with specific instruction on identifying trafficking victims during the reporting period. In addition, 29 law enforcement officers participated in a three-day trafficking-related investigations course run by International Organization for Migration (IOM), one of several anti-trafficking programs run by IOM in partnership with the Government of Bahrain. In early 2010, the Government of Bahrain centralized all trafficking-related prosecutions within the office of the Chief Prosecutor for the Manama district. Protection The Government of Bahrain made no discernible progress in improving protective services available to trafficking victims over the last year. The government continued to lack a formal procedure to identify victims among vulnerable groups, such as migrant domestic workers who have left their employers or women arrested for prostitution. As a result, potential trafficking victims may have been charged with employment or immigration violations, detained, and deported without adequate protection. Most migrant workers who were able to flee their abusive employers were frequently charged as ‚Äúrunaways,‚Äù sentenced to two weeks‚Äô detention, and deported. The government does not ensure that victims receive access to essential protective services, except for the very small number referred to the government's primary shelter. The 120-bed government- funded, NGO-run Dar Al Aman shelter provided shelter to a small number of trafficking victims. The majority of victims continued to seek shelter at their embassies or at the Migrant Workers Protection Society's shelter. The Dar Al Aman shelter does not advertise that it accepts trafficking victims, and many police officers were unfamiliar with procedures for referring victims of labor abuse and human trafficking. An international NGO reported that the shelter restricted residents‚Äô freedom of movement, was not staffed with qualified personnel, and did not provide long-term shelter or housing benefits to victims. There is a restrictive intake process for non-Bahraini victims; however, in January 2010, the government's inter-ministerial anti-trafficking committee indicated that it instructed police and prosecutors to refer any abused female worker to the shelter, regardless of signs of abuse. There are no shelters for male trafficking victims or abused or runaway workers. The three trafficking victims who the government identified during the reporting period were referred to the Dar Al Aman shelter and received legal, medical, and psychological services. The government of Bahrain encouraged victims to participate in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers. However, discouraged workers typically did not file court cases against employers due to fear or ignorance of the law, distrust of the legal system, inability to afford legal representation, lack of interpretation/translation, fear of losing residency permits during legal proceedings, and to avoid additional maltreatment at the hands of the employer. The government does not provide legal alternatives for the removal of foreign victims to countries where they face retribution or hardship. The Ministry of Interior established a toll-free hotline in January 2010 for trafficking victims, although NGOs report that news of the hotline has not been widely disseminated. Prevention The government made limited progress in preventing human trafficking over the reporting period. While Bahrain's Ministry of Labor has pledged to end the sponsorship (kafala) system, foreign workers remain tied to a Bahraini sponsor. The government implemented reforms in August 2009 which designated the Labor Market Regulatory Authority as the lead agency for granting work permits to foreign workers, and expanding labor mobility for expatriate workers, under certain conditions. These reforms do not cover Bahrain's approximately 70,000 domestic workers ‚Äì the group that is most vulnerable to trafficking. Another labor market reform limited the number of foreign workers small businesses many sponsor, which the LMRA states will cut back on illegal ‚Äúfree visa‚Äù arrangements and other labor abuses. The parliament's upper house recently approved a new labor law; however, it does not afford basic protections to domestic workers ‚Äì the group most vulnerable to human trafficking. Moreover, the law against withholding workers‚Äô passports ‚Äì a common practice that restricts the mobility of migrant workers and contributes to forced labor ‚Äì was not enforced effectively, and the practice remained widespread. The LMRA continued to distribute pamphlets ‚Äì prepared in coordination with the IOM ‚Äì that explained how to legally obtain, maintain and switch a work visa, and provided contact details to report suspected labor violations. The LMRA also sponsored a Hindi radio show designed to raise awareness of workers‚Äô rights. The government closed down a number of low-end hotels associated with organized prostitution. The government continued to provide financial support towards an IOM anti-trafficking capacity building program. The government does not have a National Plan of Action to address trafficking in persons. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs‚Äô Undersecretary chaired an inter-ministerial committee that coordinates policies designed to combat trafficking. This committee convenes every other month on average, and includes government ministries, NGOs, and the Bahrain Women's Union. The Ministry of Labor, which deals with most workers‚Äô complaints, is currently not represented on this committee.

Plot The novel centers on Charles Yu, a time machine mechanic. He lives in his TM-31 time machine with his non-existent dog, Ed, and the time machine's depressed computer, TAMMY. Yu travels through Minor Universe 31 fixing time machines of people who try to fix the past. He visits Linus Skywalker who tried to kill his father, Luke Skywalker because his father's fame overshadowed Linus's life. Yu also visits a girl who traveled to be with her grandmother as she died. Yu explains to her that because she wasn't present when it happened, she cannot stay. Yu is called in by his boss, Phil, to have his time machine serviced. He walks around in the city while his TM-31 is being repaired and visits his mother who is in a time loop in which she continually replays an hour of her life. He watches a holographic version of himself and his mother interact as she serves dinner. The next day Yu rushes back to his time machine, sees his future self exit his machine, and shoots his future self. As his future self is dying, the future self gives Yu a book and says that the book is the key. By shooting himself, Yu has entered a loop in which he must eventually travel back in time, hand his past self the book, and get shot. Yu quickly takes off in his time machine and begins to rewrite the book by reading from the book he was handed. He eventually asks himself what would happen if he skipped forward, and so he jumps to the end of the book. He wakes up in a Buddhist temple and sees \\"The Woman My Mother Should Have Been\\" as well as his father's shoes. He exits the temple and finds himself in a shuttle. Yu finds himself back in his TM-31 and floats through memories that he sees play out before him. He explains how he and his father invented the time machine and brought it to the director of research at the Institute of Conceptual Technology. Yu's father explained the concepts but was unable to get his machine to work. Back in the TM-31, Yu finds a key in the book he is writing that leads him to discover a diorama with a clock that points to a time. TAMMY and Yu realize that this is a clue to where they can find Yu's father, but also realize that they are headed back to the hangar so Yu's past self can shoot him. Yu realizes as he flies in that he loves TAMMY and she loves him. He steps out of his time machine and gets shot, but lives as it was just a shot to his stomach. In the appendix, Yu talks about visiting the place and time displayed by the diorama. He finds his father, trapped because his time machine broke down. Yu makes amends with his father and then travels to the present. He reunites his dad with his mom, then sets off to find \\"The Woman You Never Married\\". He continues to write his novel, but suggests he \\"keep stalling, see how long you can keep expanding the infinitely expandable moment\\". Reception How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe was a finalist for the 2011 John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel, and was ranked second. In The New York Times, Ander Monson noted \\"The novel‚Äôs central, lonely story is wrapped in glittering layers of gorgeous and playful meta-science-fiction ... These unexpected formal moves keep the story from dipping into the sentimental, as they usually lead to actual human emotion and thinking about what constitutes the human sense of self.\\"Ander Monson, \\"Living in your Head\\", The New York Times, September 3, 2010. Retrieved 2010-12-03. Kirkus Reviews described it as \\"A fascinating, philosophical and disorienting thriller about life and the context that gives it meaning.\\" In 2011, the book was adapted into a play by Jennifer Fawcett and Matt Slaybaugh and performed at Available Light Theatre in Columbus, Ohio.

A significant share of Bangladesh's trafficking victims are men recruited for work overseas with fraudulent employment offers who are subsequently exploited under conditions of forced labor or debt bondage. Children ‚Äì both boys and girls ‚Äì are trafficked within Bangladesh for commercial sexual exploitation, bonded labor, and forced labor. Some children are sold into bondage by their parents, while others are induced into labor or commercial sexual exploitation through fraud and physical coercion. Women and children from Bangladesh are also trafficked to India for commercial sexual exploitation. Bangladeshi men and women migrate willingly to Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Iraq, Lebanon, Malaysia, Liberia, and other countries for work, often under legal and contractual terms. Most Bangladeshis who seek overseas employment through legal channels rely on the 724 recruiting agencies belonging to the Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies (BAIRA). These agencies are legally permitted to charge workers up to $1,235 and place workers in low- skilled jobs typically paying between $110 and $150 per month. According to NGOs, however, many workers are charged upwards of $6,000 for these services. A recent Amnesty International report on Malaysia indicated Bangladeshis spend more than three times the amount of recruitment fees paid by other migrant workers recruited for work in Malaysia. NGOs report many Bangladeshi migrant laborers are victims of recruitment fraud, including exorbitant recruitment fees often accompanied by fraudulent representation of terms of employment. The ILO has concluded high recruitment fees increase vulnerability to forced labor among transnational migrant workers. Women typically work as domestic servants; some find themselves in situations of forced labor or debt bondage where they face restrictions on their movements, non-payment of wages, threats, and physical or sexual abuse. Some Bangladeshi women working abroad are subsequently trafficked into commercial sexual exploitation. Bangladeshi children and adults are also trafficked internally for commercial sexual exploitation, domestic servitude, and bonded labor. Recent reports indicate many brothel owners and pimps addict Bangladeshi girls to steroids, with harmful side effects, to make them more attractive to clients; the drug is reported to be used by 90 percent of females between 15 and 35 in Bangladeshi brothels.\\"Bangladesh\\".

[27] Emran Hossain and Mohammad Ali Zinnat with Martin Swapan Pandey mutually wrote an article in the Daily Star named ‚ÄúSlave Trade Booms in Dark Triangle‚Äù. In this article, there was a picture drawn where seven steps of trafficking in sea route were mentioned. Cox‚Äôs Bazar especially teknaf town is the main sea route for smuggling Bangladeshis and Rohingyas towards Southeast Asian countries. Each victim of trafficking has to pay a lot of taka in every step which can be estimated between Tk. 2,50,000 and Tk. 4,50,000. [28] During traveling through the Bay of Bengal, a fortune-seeker has to stay 25 to 30 days, sometimes two months in a small fishing boat. Many passengers die from dehydration or starvation in the ship and their bodies are tossed into the ocean. UNHCR estimates that in 2014 alone, 750 people died at sea on this route. [29] The boats land in Thailand. The survivors of the boat are detained in a jungle camp. A big amount between Tk. 2 lakh and 3.5 lakh is claimed from the victims as ransom [30] . The detained persons are not sent to country of destination, especially Malaysia if they fail to pay ransom claimed. If anyone fails to pay the ransom, he is used as slave or killed by the traffickers. The dead bodies are either tossed into the ocean or buried in Thai Jungle. 26 bodies were found in Sadao district, Songkhla province of Thailand on 2 May 2015[31] . Thai authority suspected that they were trafficked migrants from Bangladesh and Myanmar. Many jobseekers are victimized after reaching the country of destination by robbing the passport and visa of that country and they are victimized of forced labor by the traffickers. The victim can do nothing against the traffickers fearing the arrest as illegal migrant. Some fenceless women are trafficked to India, Pakistan, or Nepal crossing the border for sexual exploitation. Some women are smuggled to the Middle East as house-keepers, but actually they are victimized of trafficking for the purpose of prostitution. The country of destination for trafficking from Bangladesh: Almost 10 million Bangladeshi migrants work all over the world. Among them 90% stay in Middle Eastern countries [32] , like Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Lebanon, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain, Egypt etc. Many Bangladeshi trafficking victims including men and women are victimized in those countries either for sexual exploitation, or for forced labor. Bangladeshis are lured to go to those countries, because some successful Bangladeshi migrants stay there. A number of Bangladeshi women including girls under 18 and children are trafficked to India, Pakistan, and some other South Eastern countries including Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand whether for sexual exploitation, forced labor, or removal of organs. From 2011, almost all Middle Eastern countries closed to appoint workers from Bangladesh. Therefore, they are lured into trap to go to South Eastern countries and they are victimized of trafficking. Bangladesh does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government has continued to address the sex trafficking of women and children. Despite these significant efforts, the government did not demonstrate evidence of increased efforts to prosecute and convict labor trafficking offenders, particularly those responsible for the fraudulent recruitment of Bangladeshi workers for the purpose of forced labor overseas. Similarly it did not demonstrate increased efforts to prevent the forced labor of Bangladeshi workers overseas through effective controls on high recruitment fees and other forms of fraudulent recruitment; therefore, Bangladesh is placed on the Tier 3 Watch List for the second consecutive year. Some government officials and members of civil society continue to believe the forced labor and debt bondage of Bangladeshi workers abroad was not considered labor trafficking, but rather employment fraud perpetrated on irregular migrants. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2 Watchlist\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Government of Bangladesh did not provide evidence of increasing efforts to combat sex trafficking or forced labor during the reporting period. Bangladesh prohibits the trafficking of women and children for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation or involuntary servitude under the Repression of Women and Children Act of 2000 (amended in 2003), and prohibits the selling and buying of a Prostitution of children child under the age of 18 for prostitution in Articles 372 and 373 of its penal code. Prescribed penalties under these sex trafficking statutes range from 10 years‚Äô imprisonment to the death penalty. The most common sentence imposed on convicted sex traffickers is life imprisonment. These penalties are very stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Article 374 of Penal code of Bangladesh|Bangladesh's penal code prohibits forced labor, but the prescribed penalties of imprisonment for up to one year or a fine are not sufficiently stringent. During the reporting period, the government obtained the convictions of 32 sex trafficking offenders and sentenced 24 of them to life imprisonment; eight were sentenced to lesser prison terms. This is a slight decrease from the 37 convictions obtained in 2008. The government did not report the conviction of any labor trafficking offenders. The government prosecuted 68 cases involving suspected sex trafficking offenders and conducted 26 investigations, compared with 90 prosecutions and 134 investigations during the previous year. Forty-nine prosecutions resulted in acquittals; however, under Bangladeshi law the term \\"acquittal\\" can also refer to cases in which the parties settled out of court or witnesses did not appear in court. Despite administrative actions taken against labor recruitment agencies involved in fraudulent recruitment and possible human trafficking, the government did not report any criminal prosecutions or convictions for labor trafficking offenses. The Bangladeshi judicial system's handling of sex trafficking cases continued to have a large backlog and delays caused by procedural loopholes. Most sex trafficking cases are prosecuted by 42 special courts for the prosecution of crimes of violence against women and children in 32 districts of the country; those courts are generally more efficient than regular trial courts. The Ministry of Home Affairs‚Äô Anti-Trafficking Monitoring Cell reportedly collected data on trafficking arrests, prosecutions, and rescues, and coordinated and analyzed local-level information from regional anti-trafficking units. During the year, there was some evidence of official complicity in human trafficking. Several NGOs reported a nexus among members of parliament and corrupt recruiting agencies and village level brokers and indicated that politicians and regional gangs were involved in human trafficking. Some NGOs also report that official recruitment agencies in Dhaka have linkages with employers in destination countries who sometimes put their migrant workers in situations of servitude. Low-level government employees were also complicit in trafficking. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, the government prosecuted a civil servant who was complicit in trafficking; the trial remained ongoing at the end of the reporting period. The government confirmed the existence of allegations against some Bangladeshi soldiers in Sierra Leone who may have engaged in or facilitated trafficking, but the government did not provide any information on investigations or prosecutions of these cases. The country‚Äôs National Police Academy (Bangladesh)|National Police Academy provided anti-trafficking training to 2,876 police officers in 2009. The 12 police officers of the Ministry of Home Affairs‚Äô \\"Trafficking in Human Beings Investigation Unit\\" continued to receive training on investigation techniques. Other government officials received training from NGOs, international organizations, and foreign governments. A 2009 report from a prominent NGO suggested that law enforcement trainings have not translated into increased prosecutions or a change in outlook. Protection The Government of Bangladesh made limited efforts to protect victims of trafficking over the last year. The government's lack of efforts to protect victims of forced labor ‚Äì who constitute a large share of victims in the country ‚Äì and adult male victims of trafficking is a continuing concern. While the government did not have a systematic procedure to identify and refer female and child victims of trafficking, the courts, police, or Home Ministry officials referred victims of internal trafficking to shelters. Law enforcement officials identified and rescued 68 victims (38 females and 30 children) in the reporting period, but it is uncertain whether they were referred to shelters. In the previous year, law enforcement officials identified and rescued 251 victims. While the government did not provide shelter or other services dedicated to trafficking victims, it continued to run nine homes for women and children victims of violence, including trafficking, as well as a \\"one-stop crisis center\\" for women and children in the Dhaka general hospital. These centers, in cooperation with NGOs, provided legal, medical, and psychiatric services. During the last year, 384 victims were served by government and NGO care facilities in Bangladesh; some of these may have been victims of trafficking. The Ministry of Expatriate Welfare and Overseas Employment continued to operate shelters for female Bangladeshi victims of trafficking and exploitation in Riyadh and Jeddah. Law enforcement personnel encouraged victims of trafficking, when identified, to participate in investigations and prosecutions of their traffickers, but there was no evidence of the number of victims who assisted in investigations and prosecutions of traffickers in the reporting period. Authorities did not penalize victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their being trafficked. When no space was available in shelter homes, however, female victims of trafficking ‚Äì as wards of the police or court ‚Äì stayed in jails. From February to October 2009, local police in India rescued seven adult female Bangladeshi sex trafficking victims. In March 2010 ‚Äì after some of the women had remained in shelters for over a year in India ‚Äì the Government of Bangladesh began working with NGOs and the Government of India Indian government to repatriate these women. As of the writing of this report, the process has not been finalized. While workers ostensibly had several options to address complaints of labor and recruitment violations and to get compensation, the process most often used ‚Äì arbitration by Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies (BAIRA) ‚Äì did not provide sufficient financial compensation and rarely addressed the illegal activities of some recruitment agencies, all of which are BAIRA members. The Bureau of Manpower Employment and Training (BMET), which is charged with overseeing recruitment agencies and monitoring the condition of Bangladeshi workers overseas, regularly steers workers with complaints to BAIRA for resolution. Workers are drawn to the BAIRA complaint mechanism because it offers quick cash payouts (though usually much less than the wages they were denied and the recruitment fees paid) and requires significantly less proof of paid fees ‚Äì most fees charged were illegal and thus had no corresponding receipts. If there are \\"major\\" disputes, recruitment agencies may lose their licenses; however, NGOs report that friends and family members of agency heads successfully file for new licenses. Recruitment agencies may also incur criminal charges. According to Ministry of Expatriate Welfare and Overseas Employment (MEWOE), the government disposed 893 of 1,030 labor complaints in the reporting period (as opposed to disposing 745 complaints of 1,010 the year before); some of these complaints were likely due to trafficking offenses. NGOs allege officials working at Bangladeshi embassies abroad were mostly unresponsive to complaints and attempts to seek restitution abroad were rare. The Government of Bangladesh continued to donate land for an IOM project which established a coffee stand run by rehabilitated trafficking victims. Prevention The Bangladeshi government failed to take adequate efforts to prevent the forced labor of Bangladeshis abroad and at home, and made modest efforts to prevent sex trafficking over the reporting period. During the reporting period, the BMET reportedly shut down one recruiting agency, cancelled the licenses and confiscated the security deposit money of six agencies for their involvement in fraudulent recruitment practices that potentially facilitated human trafficking. This is a decrease from the nine agencies shut down and 25 agencies whose licenses were cancelled in the previous reporting period. BMET collected approximately $830,000 in fines from recruitment agencies for fraudulent recruitment practices and other infractions. The government continued to allow BAIRA to set fees, license individual agencies, certify workers for overseas labor, and handle most complaints of expatriate laborers, while not exercising adequate oversight over this consortium of labor recruiters to ensure their practices do not facilitate debt bondage of Bangladeshi workers abroad. Various ministries disseminated numerous anti-sex trafficking messages in forums including public service announcements, discussions, songs, rallies, and posters. The Monitoring Cell reported anti-sex trafficking messaging was included in monthly public outreach sessions conducted by government heads in each of Bangladesh's 65 units. The Home Secretary continued to chair the monthly inter-ministerial National Anti- Trafficking Committee Meetings, which oversees district-level committees in 64 districts. The Home Secretary also regularly holds coordination committee meetings with NGOs, although some NGOs note that the meetings often have broad agendas and do not focus adequately on trafficking. The Ministry of Home Affairs published the Bangladesh Country Report on Combating Trafficking in Women and Children. While the government made the registration compulsory in 2006, the national rate of birth registration is only between seven and 10 percent, and most children born in the rural areas are still not properly documented. During the year, the government did not demonstrate measures to reduce the demand for forced labor or for commercial sex acts. Bangladesh is not a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.

Some children in Barbados are subjected to commercial sexual exploitation in ‚Äútransactional sex‚Äù wherein a third party such as a parent receives a benefit from the child‚Äôs participation in sexual activity. Researchers identified patterns of transactional sex within families, most often by adult male caretakers such as step-fathers, as well as child prostitution outside the home. Women from the Dominican Republic, Guyana, and Jamaica voluntarily enter Barbados as illegal migrants, and some expect to engage in prostitution. Some of these women are exploited in forced prostitution subsequent to their arrival. Some other foreign women who entered the country illegally are exploited in involuntary domestic servitude in private homes. Foreign men have been transported to Barbados for the purpose of labor exploitation in construction and other sectors. Sex traffickers, primarily organized criminals from Guyana, form partnerships with pimps and brothel owners from Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados, and lure women to Barbados with offers of legitimate work. Trafficking victims tend to enter the country through legal means, usually by air; traffickers later use force and coercion to obtain and maintain the victims‚Äô work in strip clubs, massage parlors, some private residences, and ‚Äúentertainment clubs‚Äù which operate as brothels. Traffickers use methods such as threats of physical harm or deportation, debt bondage, false contracts, psychological abuse, and confinement to force victims to work in construction, the garment industry, agriculture, or private households.\\"Barbados\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The Government of Barbados does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Despite these efforts, particularly an aggressive public campaign begun by government ministries and the continued drafting of a comprehensive anti-trafficking law, the government‚Äôs overall efforts did not improve over the reporting period. Law enforcement and immigration officials continued to summarily deport undocumented foreigners without determining whether they are trafficking victims; the government opened no investigations into possible cases of sex or labor trafficking; and it did not prosecute any trafficking cases during the year. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Barbadian government made no discernible progress in its anti-human trafficking law enforcement efforts during the year. Law enforcement agencies faced resource constraints and competing priorities. No trafficking offenders were prosecuted during the year. No cases were brought against employers for confiscating passports or travel documents. Barbados has no specific law prohibiting human trafficking, but slavery and forced labor are constitutionally prohibited. Existing statutes such as the Sexual Offences Act of 1992, Cap. 154 and the Offences Against the Person Act of 1994, Cap. 141 prohibit some trafficking offenses, as well as trafficking-related offenses, though these were not used to prosecute and convict trafficking offenders during the year. Sections 33 and 34 of the Offences Against the Person Act prohibit the crime of slavery; penalties for this offense range from five to 15 years‚Äô imprisonment and are sufficiently stringent. There were no reports of government officials‚Äô complicity in human trafficking. Protection The Government of Barbados maintained its moderate efforts to ensure victims‚Äô access to necessary protective services over the last year. As the crime of trafficking does not officially exist in Barbadian law, there are no legal protections provided for trafficking victims. Existing facilities which provide assistance to victims of other crimes, such as rape and child abuse, that are partially funded by the government and run by NGOs, may have provided services to child victims of sex trafficking without having identified them as human trafficking victims. Neither government nor NGO personnel could provide information about whether any trafficking victims were identified at these facilities. The Gender Affairs Bureau arranged for assistance to be provided to victims of any crime regardless of whether they participated in investigations or prosecutions. Officials from this Bureau collaborated with a local NGO to sensitize government agencies on the difference between smuggling and trafficking, the importance of referring victims to services provided in collaboration with NGOs, and the importance of implementing a trafficking-specific protocol and legislation to better target their efforts. Victims of trafficking (like victims of other crimes) were not usually encouraged to participate in investigations or prosecutions of trafficking offenders. Trafficking victims could be prosecuted for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their being trafficked. Most law enforcement and immigration officials still do not have the appropriate training, funding, and other necessary mechanisms to identify victims or suspected cases of trafficking. The government provided no legal alternatives for the removal of foreign trafficking victims to countries where they may face hardship or retribution. Police claimed to have no option under current laws but to treat foreign trafficking victims without valid immigration documents as violators of the law subject to summary deportation. There have been no reported cases of Barbadians trafficked to foreign countries, although the Bureau of Gender Affairs has specialized services in place should such a case arise. In 2016 Barbados passed the Trafficking in Persons Prevention Act, 2016. This Act repealed and replaced Transnational Organizational Crime (Prevention and Control) Act, 2011, which provided for prosecution of all forms of human trafficking including the removal of human organs. The Trafficking in Persons Prevention Act, 2016 gives effect to the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons,Especially Women and Children, Supplementing, the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime. Section 3 of this 2016 Act provides for the offence of trafficking in persons and the penalty is a fine of one million dollars, 25 years in prison or both the fine and imprisonment. Section 4 provides for the offence of trafficking in children and the penalty is two million dollars or life imprisonment or both. Section 6 makes it an offence to hold or keep a persons travel documents and the penalty for this offence is $250 000, 20 years in prison or both. Section 7 makes it an offence to transport or conspire to transport a person for the purpose of exploiting that person for prostitution. Section 8 and 9 make it offence to received financial benefit from trafficking in persons or children respectively. Section 10 provides for the forfeiture of the proceeds of trafficking. Section 12 provides for the Directors or agent of the company to be liable for trafficking depending on the proven level of the companies involvement. Section 11 provides for restitution to victims in the way of loss of income, compensation for their distress and for medical expenses to name a few areas. Section 20 provides for victims to be given a safe haven when found and to be safe passage to their home country or country of their choice. These provisions are in keeping with the required international standards. Prevention The government made weak efforts to prevent human trafficking and raise the public‚Äôs awareness of the risks and dangers of human trafficking in Barbados. In 2004, the government began work on a protocol for anti- trafficking action, which the Gender Affairs Bureau passed to other government agencies for comment in early 2009. The protocol was expected to be introduced in Parliament in April 2010. The Minister of Youth, Family, and Sports spoke openly against child prostitution on several occasions, a subject which had not often been raised in public before. During the year, the government continued to host educational workshops for an unspecified number of officials and social service providers. There was no formal mechanism for coordinating government and NGO action on trafficking issues, but the Bureau of Gender Affairs worked with regional and local NGOs, religious organizations, and community advocates to better organize their anti-trafficking efforts and outreach. Although public commentary on the problem of sex tourism, including child sex tourism, has been increasing, the government has made no noticeable efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts. Barbados is not a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.

The majority of identified Belarusian victims were females forced into prostitution abroad, including in: Russia, Germany, Poland, other European countries, Turkey, Israel, Lebanon, and the UAE. There were reports that women from low-income families in Belarus‚Äô regions were subjected to forced prostitution in Minsk. Belarusian men, women, and children continued to be subjected to forced begging, as well as forced labor in the construction industry and other sectors in Russia. According to the Ministry of Interior, Belarusian single, unemployed females between the ages of 16 and 30 were most at risk of being trafficked. Human traffickers often used informal social networks to approach potential victims.\\"Belarus\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The Government of Belarus does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government‚Äôs response to trafficking is difficult to gauge due to the closed nature of the government, sparse independent reporting, and general fear of government retaliation for criticism of the ruling regime. However, based on available information, the government appeared to have sustained its efforts to prosecute and punish trafficking offenders in 2009. While the government appeared to continue positive steps toward improved treatment of victims and support of the anti-trafficking NGO community, the overall political climate of intimidation was a natural obstacle to authentic government partnerships with victims and anti-trafficking organizations. Funding for victim assistance programs codified into law in 2005 remained unrealized. The U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed Belarus in \\"Tier 3\\" in 2017. Prosecution The government sustained law enforcement efforts during the reporting period. Belarusian law prohibits trafficking in persons for both sexual exploitation and labor exploitation under Article 181 of its criminal code, which prescribes penalties ranging from two to 15 years‚Äô imprisonment in addition to asset forfeiture. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and are commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes. The government reported 219 human trafficking investigations in 2009, including at least 10 labor trafficking investigations. Authorities reportedly prosecuted 61 cases under Article 181, and convicted 15 trafficking offenders under the same statute in 2009, down from 17 convictions in 2008. The government did not report how many of the convictions were for forced labor versus forced prostitution. Officials reported that the majority of convicted trafficking offenders were given imposed sentences of over eight years‚Äô imprisonment, in addition to the forfeiture of assets. While reports indicated that officials engaged in corrupt practices, there were no reports of government complicity in human trafficking during the reporting period ‚Äì such information may have been limited because of lack of press freedom and imprisonment of citizens for criticizing government officials in Belarus. In general, the judiciary lacked independence, trial outcomes usually were predetermined, and many trials were conducted behind closed doors. The Ministry of Interior continued to provide at least partial funding for its anti-trafficking training center, which has trained 47 Belarusian law enforcement officers and officials from other governments as trafficking specialists since 2007. Courses at the center reportedly focused on anti-trafficking law enforcement techniques and victim assistance, and were developed in partnership with IOM, other international organizations, and NGOs. The government reported partnerships with the following governments on trafficking cases: Poland, Germany, the Czech Republic, Israel, and Turkey. Protection The government demonstrated minimal progress in protecting victims of trafficking during the reporting period, including a significant decrease in the number of victims identified. In 2009, authorities identified 369 victims of sex trafficking, including 35 children, and 29 labor trafficking victims in 2009, a significant decrease from a total of 591 victims identified in 2008. The government reported referring only 131 victims to service providers for assistance, raising concerns that the formal, national trafficking victim referral mechanism was not successfully implemented. Law enforcement officials generally referred trafficking victims to IOM or NGO shelters ‚Äì which relied on donor funding ‚Äì to provide short and longer term protection and rehabilitation; the government referred child trafficking victims to NGOs for assistance. The government again failed to provide funding for specialized victim assistance programs pledged in a 2005 presidential decree, but provided some in-kind donations to NGOs. Victims could seek state medical assistance and some other services, such as vocational training, free of charge, but most victims declined assistance from government facilities. Government sources acknowledged that victims were more likely to trust NGOs than government sources of assistance. Anti-trafficking NGOs reported little government interference in their operations; they also reported improved communication with government officials during past year. In some instances during the reporting period, the government permitted NGO specialists to attend police interviews and closed court hearings upon victims‚Äô requests. The government claimed to have encouraged victims to participate in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers. The anti-trafficking training center reportedly emphasized the need to avoid coercing victims, which had been reported as a problem in the past. There were no reports of identified victims being penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. Belarusian law allows for authorities to grant temporary residency status to foreign victims, though no victims chose this immigration relief during the reporting period. Prevention The government demonstrated modest progress in trafficking prevention activities during the reporting period. Citizens, the media, and NGOs in Belarus are often subjected to government intimidation and strict control, which limited open discussion about the trafficking situation in the country. Officials continued to conduct press conferences and briefings on the anti-trafficking situation in Belarus, focusing primarily on forced prostitution, during the reporting period. The government aired IOM-sponsored anti-trafficking public service announcements on state television and on television screens in subway stops, which resulted in an increased number of calls to IOM‚Äôs hotline. The Ministry of Interior continued to run a hotline offering information regarding the licensing status and legitimacy of marriage, modeling agencies, and agencies involved in work and study abroad. NGO's reported cooperation between the government hotline and their own hotlines, as well as partnerships with authorities in distributing NGO-funded public awareness materials. There were reports that some policies described by the Belarusian government as anti-trafficking measures were responsible for restricting Belarusian citizens‚Äô ability to travel abroad for legitimate purposes. The government‚Äôs national action plan on trafficking, which expired in 2010, focused on illegal migration which may lead to confusion between trafficking and smuggling.

Victims originate in Eastern Europe, Africa, East Asia, as well as Brazil and India. Some victims are smuggled through Belgium to other European countries, where they are subjected to forced labor and forced prostitution. Male victims are subjected to forced labor and exploitation in restaurants, bars, sweatshops, horticulture sites, fruit farms, construction sites, and retail shops. There were reportedly seven Belgian women subjected to forced prostitution in Luxembourg in 2009. According to a 2009 ECPAT Report, the majority of girls and children subjected to forced prostitution in Belgium originate from Eastern Europe and Nigeria; some young foreign boys are exploited in prostitution in major cities in the country. Local observers also report that a large portion of children trafficked in Belgium are unaccompanied, vulnerable asylum seekers and refugees. According to the Belgian immigration office, the government identified eight children between January and June 2009 as trafficked. Foreign workers continued to be subjected to involuntary domestic servitude in Belgium, some involving members of the international diplomatic community posted in Belgium.\\"Belgium\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The Government of Belgium fully complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. The government demonstrated it vigorously investigated, prosecuted, and convicted trafficking offenders. It continued to fund NGOs to provide comprehensive protection and assistance to victims subjected to forced prostitution and forced labor in 2009. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 1\\" in 2017. Prosecution Belgium prohibits all forms of trafficking through a 2005 amendment to its 1995 Act Containing Measures to Repress Trafficking in Persons. As amended, the law‚Äôs maximum prescribed penalties for all forms of trafficking ‚Äì 30 years‚Äô imprisonment ‚Äì is sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The government reported prosecuting 387 trafficking suspects in 2009 and convicting 151 trafficking offenders in 2008; sentences for 146 convicted traffickers ranged from less than one year to 10 years in prison. According to a 2009 UNO DC Report, the Belgian government aggregated law enforcement data on trafficking into a single data base which conflates smuggling with trafficking offenses; the government, however, reported that all 151 convicted persons in 2008 were convicted for trafficking-specific offenses. The government did not disaggregate this data to demonstrate how many people were convicted for sex trafficking versus forced labor. Furthermore, the failure of an employer to meet wage, hours, and working conditions in accordance with prevailing labor legislation and collective bargaining agreements constitutes ‚Äúexploitation‚Äù under Belgium‚Äôs anti-trafficking law. An EU Schengen evaluation report issued in December 2009, stated that anti-trafficking prosecutors in Belgium report difficulty distinguishing between sexual exploitation as such, and sexual exploitation related to trafficking; this report also noted prosecutor‚Äôs difficulty in separating a victim of trafficking from economic exploitation from one of illegal employment. Furthermore, this evaluation reported that despite adequate legislation, the government convicted a relatively low number of offenders for nonconsensual sexual and economic exploitation. The report, however, praised the government for its multidisciplinary approach on trafficking cases and highlighted it as a best practice in Europe. The government previously reported that it charged eight family members of the royal family of Abu Dhabi (UAE) with human trafficking in 2008 for subjecting 17 girls to forced servitude while staying at a Brussels hotel. The government reportedly has not yet scheduled trial proceedings for this case, though they were to have occurred in early 2010. The implicated sheikha and seven other family members have not returned to Belgium. The government reported its prosecution in 2009 of two Belgian consular officers posted in Bulgaria in 1990 for issuing fraudulent visas to traffickers operating under the cover of travel agencies. The government incarcerated a Ministry of Justice and a state security official arrested in January 2009 for being suspected of assisting a ring subjecting 17 Thai women to forced prostitution in massage parlors. Protection The government continued its efforts to protect victims of trafficking; however it reported a decrease in the number of trafficking victims identified and referred for protection in 2009. The government continued to fund three NGOs to shelter and provide comprehensive assistance to trafficking victims. These three NGOs assisted 465 potential trafficking victims during the reporting period; 158 of these were new referrals, a significant decline from the 495 total identified and referred in 2008. The government reported 103 victims of sexual and economic exploitation filed applications for temporary residency in Belgium in 2009, but did not provide the number of residency permits that were officially granted. The government reportedly used proactive procedures to identify victims of trafficking based on a 2008 interagency directive on coordination and assistance to trafficking victims; a December 2009 EU Schengen evaluation cited the guidelines for victim identification as a best practice. Belgian law allows the provision of extendable temporary residence status and permanent residence status to victims who participated in trafficking investigations and prosecutions. Residence can be granted before an investigation is completed at judicial discretion; residency can also be granted even without a successful prosecution. Children who were victims of trafficking reportedly were granted three months in which to decide whether to testify against their traffickers. According to a 2009 End Child Prostitution in Asia Tourism (ECPAT) report, Belgian officials will only officially recognize a person as a victim of trafficking if that person has broken off all contact with their traffickers, agrees to counseling at a specialized reception center, and officially files a complaint against the traffickers. The report noted that these conditions for victim assistance are too high for child victims to meet. According to the government, if a child did not qualify for victim status, they may still have qualified for protection under the government‚Äôs rules for unaccompanied minors. Victims who served as prosecutors‚Äô witnesses in court were entitled to seek legal employment during the relevant legal proceedings. A report released by the government in December 2009 noted that undocumented victims of economic exploitation often hesitate to collaborate with law enforcement, fearing deportation. The report also noted that victims of economic exploitation occasionally end up in centers for rejected asylum seekers before being directed to shelters. Identified victims were not inappropriately incarcerated, fined, or penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. IOM reported it repatriated five victims of trafficking, three adults and two unaccompanied minors, in 2009. Prevention The Government of Belgium sustained its progress to prevent trafficking in 2009. The government continued to fund its ongoing ‚ÄúStop Child Prostitution‚Äù prevention program in 2009. It reported that Belgian authorities launched an information campaign to increase identification and protection for Brazilian victims of forced labor. In 2009, the government issued a flyer in 27 languages for potential trafficking victims distributed by the police, the shelters, and available in airports and railway stations. In April 2009, in partnership with an NGO, the government held a colloquium in the Belgian Senate to generate greater parliamentary interest in trafficking issues. Reportedly, Brussels, Antwerp, and Liege took measures to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts during the reporting period. Following the example of Brussels and Antwerp, the Liege city government closed 51 brothels in September 2008, limiting prostitution to a few registered bars. Belgian law allows for the prosecution of Belgian nationals for child abuse crimes committed abroad. The Belgian authorities identified child sex tourism as a serious problem among Belgian nationals, but reported no prosecutions of such activity. The government provided specific anti-trafficking training to Belgian troops before they were deployed on international peacekeeping missions.

Until recently, analysts also considered Benin a destination country for foreign children brought to the country and subjected to forced labor, but new information from government and non-government sources indicates the total number of such children is not significant. The majority of victims are girls trafficked into domestic servitude or the commercial sex trade in Cotonou, the administrative capital. Some boys are forced to labor on farms, work in construction, produce handicrafts, or hawk items on the street. Many traffickers are relatives or acquaintances of their victims, exploiting the traditional system of vidomegon, in which parents allow their children to live with and work for richer relatives, usually in urban areas. There are reports that some tourists visiting Pendjari National Park in northern Benin exploit underage girls in prostitution, some of whom may be trafficking victims. Beninese children recruited for forced labor exploitation abroad are destined largely for Nigeria and Gabon, with some also going to Ivory Coast and other African countries, where they may be forced to work in mines, quarries, or the cocoa sector.\\"Benin\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The Government of Benin does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so, despite limited resources. Over the last year, the government took steps to accelerate prosecution of trafficking offenders and increase the number of protective and preventive activities. In efforts to prevent human trafficking, it promulgated three decrees regulating the movement of children into and out of Benin and continued its countrywide effort to register births and issue birth certificates to all citizens. The government did not, however, collect and make available to its citizens and partners accurate law enforcement data on human trafficking issues. Further, it did not give its officials specialized training on how to recognize, investigate, and prosecute instances of trafficking. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2 Watchlist\\" in 2017. Prosecution The government sustained its efforts to bring trafficking offenders to justice during the reporting period. Legislatively, Benin does not prohibit all forms of trafficking, though its 2006 Act Relating to the Transportation of Minors and the Suppression of Child Trafficking criminalizes all forms of child trafficking and prescribes penalties of up to 20 years‚Äô imprisonment. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and exceed those prescribed for rape. The child trafficking law does not cover adults, though existing laws against kidnapping and labor exploitation give some protection to people more than 18 years old. The Ministry of Justice, Legislation and Human Rights reported that Benin‚Äôs eight courts handled a total of 200 cases of child trafficking and related offenses, including child abduction and corruption of children. At the close of the reporting period, 155 cases remained pending, five cases were dismissed, and 40 cases resulted in convictions; the government neither specified which of these cases involved child trafficking nor provided information on sentences given to convicted trafficking offenders. The Police Brigade for the Protection of Minors (BPM) handled 58 cases involving child trafficking or illegal movement of children out of the country without parental authorization, bringing 17 perpetrators to the Cotonou court for further investigation and prosecution. Gendarmes in the village of Porga arrested suspected traffickers trying to cross the Benin-Burkina Faso border en route to Ivory Coast with five children in April 2009, and delivered them to the court at Natitingou. The government did not provide information on the outcome of the Porga case, or data on cases handled by other branches of the police. There was no evidence of Beninese government officials‚Äô complicity in trafficking offenses. Although the senior police members were provided training on child trafficking issues as part of their training at the police academy, other officials were not trained to recognize, investigate, and prosecute trafficking offenses. Protection Four government ministries and several international donors and NGOs effectively used their partnerships to widen Benin‚Äôs ability to assist, repatriate, and reintegrate victims of trafficking in 2009. The BPM reported rescuing 266 trafficking victims as they were being transported to and from Nigeria, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, and Togo; these rescues were the product of partnerships with authorities of those countries. This figure represents an increase of 22 more rescues than in the previous year. Furthermore, working with UNICEF and Gabonese officials, the government repatriated 28 Beninese children, some of whom may have been trafficking victims, rescued from a boat carrying clandestine migrants off the coast of Gabon. In most cases, the BPM took initial custody of victims once inside Benin, and after an interview to confirm their status as trafficking victims, typically referred them to a network of long-term NGO shelters. The BPM holds recovered victims at a large government-built transit shelter it maintained in Cotonou, staffed by seven NGO personnel, until transferring victims to an NGO shelter for reintegration. During 2009, the BPM shelter took in 941 children, many of whom were trafficking victims, and offered them legal, medical, and psychological assistance. The Ministry of Family and National Solidarity worked with NGOs to reunite children with their families. No child goes back to its community of origin until there is a suitable point of reinsertion such as a school, vocational center, or apprenticeship. The government extended access for these children to the national network of social promotion centers, which provide basic social services in each of the country‚Äôs 77 communes. Foreign victims of trafficking offenses received assistance from the government through the BPM and social promotion centers before repatriation. According to an NGO leading the repatriation and shelter of Beninese victims from the Abeokuta quarries in Nigeria, the Beninese Ministry of Family, the BPM, and the Beninese Consulate in Nigeria repatriated 20 trafficking victims between August and December 2009. Both BPM and the office of Family and Child Monitoring at the Ministry of Family established operational databases on child trafficking during the year, but neither yielded data on trafficking victims during the reporting period. Officials encouraged victims to assist in the investigation of trafficking offenders, but shielded children from taking part in the trial unless a judge required it. Victims were not inappropriately incarcerated or fined for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked, but the government did not have a mechanism for screening victims of trafficking among populations of women and children in prostitution. Prevention Through partnerships with local and international agencies, the government provided partial support for several new programs to prevent child trafficking. In 2009, the Ministry of Family, with foreign donor support, established 142 new local committees to enable community surveillance in Benin and along the Benin-Nigeria border. The BPM, immigration agents, and gendarmes took up stations at international border crossings to screen travelers and monitor the transport of children. These observers relied on community whistleblowers to alert them to suspicious cases. Furthermore, the government completed ahead of schedule its 2008-2012 National Plan to Combat Child Trafficking and Labor. Also in 2009, the government joined with foreign partners to implement a second anti-child trafficking project to improve living conditions and advance respect for children‚Äôs rights, thus addressing key structural causes of Benin‚Äôs trafficking problem. The government, in partnership with UNICEF and a major regional bank, launched a seven-day awareness campaign against child sex tourism. The government provided training to Beninese troops on issues of child trafficking and exploitation prior to their deployment abroad for international peacekeeping missions.

A large number of Bolivians are found in conditions of forced labor in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Spain, and the United States in sweatshops, factories, and agriculture. Within the country, young Bolivian women and girls from rural areas are subjected to forced prostitution in urban areas. Members of indigenous communities, particularly in the Chaco region, are at risk of forced labor within the country. A significant number of Bolivian children are subjected to conditions of forced labor in mining, agriculture, and as domestic servants, and reports indicate some parents sell or rent out their children for forced labor in mining and agriculture near border areas with Peru. The country's porous borders facilitate the movement of undocumented migrants, some of whom may be trafficked. In one case, Bolivian authorities identified 26 Haitian children who were en route to Brazil for possible forced labor and forced prostitution.\\"Bolivia\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The Government of Bolivia does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government maintained significant law enforcement efforts against sex trafficking crimes, although it did not increase convictions of trafficking offenders, which remained disproportionately low compared with high the numbers of trafficking victims identified by Bolivian authorities. The government did not show evidence of adequately addressing forced labor, and services available to individuals subjected to forced labor and repatriated Bolivians who were trafficked abroad were generally lacking. While many of Bolivia's anti-trafficking initiatives remained dependent on international donor funding, the government has initiated a project to significantly dedicate more law enforcement officers and prosecutors toward the investigation prosecution of trafficking offenses over the next year. The U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country on the \\"Tier 2 Watchlist\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Government of Bolivia sustained anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts over the last year, though it did not demonstrate increased efforts to prosecute and punish trafficking offenders. The government prohibits all forms of human trafficking through Law 3325, an anti- trafficking law enacted in 2006, which prescribes penalties of 8 to 12 years‚Äô imprisonment, penalties which are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed under Bolivian law for other serious crimes such as rape. A draft law submitted to Bolivia's Congress over the past year would enhance the government's ability to conduct thorough investigations and would improve victims‚Äô access to specialized services. The Bolivian national police investigated 288 cases suspected of involving human trafficking in 2009, a 26 percent increase over investigations initiated during the preceding year. The Bolivian government reported 21 prosecutions initiated and seven trafficking offenders convicted in 2009; three of the seven convicted offenders were given suspended sentences and released, while the other sentences ranged from three to 12 years. These actions compare with 64 prosecutions initiated and seven convictions obtained in 2008. The majority of the government's anti- trafficking law enforcement efforts focused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children, and no charges were filed for labor trafficking offenses. The government continued to operate four specialized anti- trafficking police units in La Paz, El Alto, Santa Cruz, and Cochabamba, and made preparations to open an additional six units along the frontiers with Brazil, Argentina, and Peru in 2010 with the support of a foreign government. Bolivian police increased targeted law enforcement operations against brothels, which resulted in the rescue of 287 children in conditions of forced prostitution, a 33 percent increase from the previous year. Some of these victims sought care in shelters, while others were reintegrated with their families. No criminal investigations or prosecutions of public officials allegedly involved with trafficking-related activity were initiated during the reporting period. Protection The Bolivian government sustained modest efforts to protect trafficking victims over the last year. Although law enforcement officials identified child victims during police operations in brothels, the government lacks effective procedures for identifying trafficking victims among other vulnerable populations, such as child laborers. During the past year, law enforcement officials stationed along Bolivia's borders did not systematically attempt to identify victims of trafficking among emigrating Bolivians, though reports indicate hundreds of children leave the country under suspicious circumstances each month. In larger cities, such as La Paz and Santa Cruz, the government maintains small municipal shelters capable of caring for sex trafficking victims on a short- term basis, although some shelters limit services to girls. In addition to investigating and prosecuting cases, the anti-trafficking police unit in Santa Cruz provides trafficked individuals, along with victims of domestic violence, with medical assistance and shelter, and is seen as a successful model of integrated care. Municipal shelters generally cannot, however, accommodate the demand for all forms of victim services, and in practice, services are limited to women and children trafficked into commercial sexual exploitation, with minimal resources available to male victims of trafficking or victims subjected to forced labor. Child victims may receive general care at a government-operated children's shelter, and NGOs and religious groups provide additional shelter care and reintegration training programs to trafficking victims. Temporary and long-term services for victims remain unavailable in parts of the country. The government has no dedicated programs to assist the significant numbers of Bolivians trafficked abroad and later repatriated to the country. The government encourages victims to participate in investigations and prosecutions of trafficking offenders, though victims often do not because of their fear of reprisals from traffickers. The government does not provide foreign trafficking victims with legal alternatives to deportation to countries where they may face hardship or retribution. While the government provided no specialized training in the identification of trafficking victims, other partners, including NGOs and foreign governments, provided training to police, prosecutors, and the general population. Prevention The government sustained previous levels of prevention and public awareness efforts, largely in collaboration with international donors. Bolivian authorities continued to forge partnerships with NGOs, international organizations, and other governments on prevention activities, and hosted the country's first International Trafficking in Persons conference in March 2009. No efforts to reduce demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor were reported during the year. The government provided anti-trafficking training for its troops before they deployed on international peacekeeping missions.

There were four identified victims from Serbia in 2009. Most trafficked women entered the country through Serbia or Montenegro. There were reports that some girls, particularly Roma, were trafficked, using forced marriage, for the purpose of involuntary domestic servitude, and that Roma boys and girls were subjected to forced begging by organized groups. There was one case involving Bosnian males recruited for labor and subjected to coercive conditions in Azerbaijan in 2009. NGO's report that traffickers frequently use intermediaries to bring clients to private apartments, motels, and gas stations where victims are held.\\"Bosnia and Herzegovina\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The Government of Bosnia fully complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. The government made clear progress in its anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts during the reporting period by significantly reducing its use of suspended sentences and imposing stronger penalties for convicted traffickers. The government employed proactive systematic procedures to identify potential victims throughout the reporting period, registering a greater number of trafficking victims, and referred them to NGO service providers which it funded. The U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Although the government claimed compliance, the report noted the inability to fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking but that it is making significant efforts to do so. Prosecution The Government of Bosnia made significant progress in its anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts over the last year, delivering one of the highest sentences for trafficking ever prosecuted in Bosnia. The government also reduced its use of suspended sentences and increased penalties for convicted traffickers. The Government of Bosnia prohibits trafficking for sexual and labor exploitation through Article 186 of its criminal code, which prescribes penalties of up to 10 years‚Äô imprisonment. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The government amended its criminal code in 2009, setting a three-year minimum sentence for trafficking and increasing the minimum penalty for officials involved in trafficking. The national government successfully prosecuted a landmark trafficking case involving a high-level trafficker in 2009, sentencing the ringleader to 12 years in prison, fining him $14,286, and ordering the forfeiture of over $204,600 in assets. In 2009, the national government investigated 14 suspected trafficking cases, and local authorities investigated 21 such cases. The national government prosecuted three cases involving 12 suspected trafficking offenders in 2009, and convicted 11 trafficking offenders; sentences for 11 convicted traffickers in two cases ranged from five months to 12 years‚Äô imprisonment. Six of these sentences were over three years in length, and one suspect was acquitted. Courts in the Federation prosecuted seven cases, convicted 11 traffickers, and sentenced nine of them to one to three years. Finally, in the Republika Srpska, authorities reportedly prosecuted nine trafficking cases and convicted five trafficking offenders, resulting in sentences ranging from one to two years. State and local-level courts suspended sentences for two convicted traffickers in 2009, a notable decrease from 14 suspended sentences in 2008. Under Bosnian law, many convicted offenders are eligible for weekend furloughs from prison; thus, some convicted traffickers in 2009 may have been released on weekends, posing a potential risk to their victims. There were continued anecdotal reports of police and other officials‚Äô facilitation of trafficking, including by willfully ignoring or actively protecting traffickers or exploiters of trafficking victims in return for payoffs. In March 2010, the government arrested 16 suspects, including the Srebrenica deputy mayor, local religious officials, school officials, and police officers for their alleged involvement in the trafficking and forced prostitution of a Roma girl. The government reported all suspects were subsequently released two days after the arrests, citing lack of sufficient evidence to detain them. The State Minister of Security was also interrogated as a suspect. The investigation remains ongoing. Two local officials under investigation by the State Prosecutor for their December 2007 involvement in forced prostitution of three children were released from custody on February 12, 2009. Trial proceedings are still ongoing. The government has yet to convict any government officials for trafficking-related complicity. Prosecution is crucial in addressing the human trafficking problem in Bosnia and Herzegovina because, without it, the problem degenerates to a cycle. In this condition, the victims gets repatriated to their home countries only to be retrafficked, creating what some calls as repatriation factory. Protection The Government of Bosnia made progress in identifying and protecting victims of trafficking in 2009. The government continued to provide sufficient funding to six local NGOs that provided shelter and medical and psychological assistance to foreign and domestic victims during the reporting period. In 2009, the government provided $32,000 for the care of domestic victims and $71,400 for care to foreign victims of trafficking, including repatriation assistance. The government employed systematic proactive procedures for identifying and referring both foreign and domestic victims to NGO service providers, and registered 46 trafficking victims in 2009, an increase from 29 identified in 2008. Government-funded NGOs provided shelter to 18 victims during the reporting period; the remaining 28 victims received services from NGOs on an outpatient basis. The government encouraged victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers, and relied on the voluntary cooperation of victims as witnesses in all of its prosecutions in 2009. However, a 2009 report issued by Dr. Gilly McKenzie of the Interpol Organized Crime Division, reported witness protection in Bosnia remained inadequate. The government provided legal alternatives to the removal of foreign trafficking victims to countries where they face hardship or retribution through the provision of short- and long-term residence permits. In 2009, the government provided six victims with residence permits, an increase from the two permits the previous year. Police and border officers continued to employ systematic procedures for identifying trafficking victims among vulnerable populations, and the government continued to train its consular officials abroad on ways to identify potential trafficking victims among persons applying for Bosnian visas. The government ensured that identified victims were not penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their being trafficked; however, unidentified victims were likely inadvertently deported or occasionally prosecuted for immigration or other violations. The government failed to protect the confidentiality of an alleged underage sex trafficking victim during the reporting period by allowing some media to disclose her full name and photo. While the government reported that authorities referred the victim to one of its shelters for care, the disclosure of her identify likely hampered the government's ability to adequately protect her. Prevention Prevention initiatives undertaken by the government is based on the implementation of the 2016-2019 national anti- trafficking plan, which prescribed specific efforts to identify trafficking incidents and the protection of victims in cooperation with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and NGOs. For instance, the Office of the State Coordinator coordinates and supervises an NGO-funded comprehensive campaign targeted at young people seeking employment abroad that includes TV spots, billboards, and pamphlets. The government continued to fund an NGO's operation of an anti-trafficking hotline in 2009. The partnership with the OSCE also involved the training of prosecutors and judges to augment practical and theoretical knowledge on the elements of human trafficking as a crime as well as their role in addressing issues of victim and witness support within the judicial system. OSCE, for its part, is focused on working with domestic institutions and international partners to enhance the legislative and policy framework for human trafficking in the country. The Bosnia and Herzegovina government is also continuing to give specialized trafficking awareness training to Bosnian troops before their deployment on international peacekeeping missions. In partnership with the Norwegian government, it developed a manual for police, prosecutors, social centers and health care officials on preventing child trafficking. The government did not conduct any awareness campaigns specifically aimed at reducing demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor.

Parents in poor rural communities sometimes send their children to work for wealthier families as domestics in cities or as herders at remote cattle posts, where some of these children are vulnerable to forced labor. Batswana girls are exploited in prostitution within the country, including in bars and by truck drivers along major highways; it does not appear, however, that organized pimping of children occurs. In the past, women reported being forced into commercial sexual exploitation at some safari lodges, but there were no similar reports during this reporting period. Residents in Botswana most susceptible to trafficking are illegal immigrants from Zimbabwe, unemployed men and women, those living in rural poverty, agricultural workers, and children orphaned by HIV/AIDS. Some women from Zimbabwe who voluntarily, but illegally, migrate to Botswana to seek employment are subsequently subjected by their employers to involuntary domestic servitude. Botswana families which employ Zimbabwean women as domestic workers at times do so without proper work permits, do not pay adequate wages, and restrict or control the movement of their employees by holding their passports or threatening to have them deported back to Zimbabwe.\\"Botswana\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The Government of Botswana does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. During the reporting period, the government began drafting a comprehensive anti-trafficking law, investigated potential cases of human trafficking, and provided protective services to several individuals who may have been targets of traffickers. It failed, however, to prosecute and convict trafficking offenders or make attempts to proactively identify trafficking victims among vulnerable populations, such as irregular migrants subject to deportation. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Government of Botswana did not increase its efforts to prosecute or punish trafficking offenses over the last year, though it investigated several suspected cases of human trafficking. The government did not prosecute any trafficking offenses or convict or punish any trafficking offenders in 2009. Although it does not have a comprehensive law prohibiting trafficking in persons, provisions in the Penal Code of 1998, such as those in sections 155-158 on procurement for forced prostitution and sections 28000-262 on slavery, prohibit some forms of human trafficking. The sufficiently stringent penalties prescribed for offenses under these sections range from seven to 10 years‚Äô imprisonment, and are commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. These sections have never been used to prosecute or convict a suspected trafficking offender. In June 2009, the Parliament passed a revised Children‚Äôs Act, which defined a child as anyone under the age of 18 and increased protections for children from various forms of exploitation, including child labor and child prostitution. Section 57 of the Act prohibits the facilitation or coercion of children into prostitution and prescribes sufficiently stringent penalties of two to five years‚Äô imprisonment or a fine of $2858 to $7143. In October 2009, the Ministry of Defense, Justice and Security began drafting a comprehensive anti-trafficking law. Officers involved in law enforcement investigations of several non-trafficking crimes during 2009 observed that some of these crimes seemed to contain elements of human trafficking. Very few immigration and law enforcement officials are trained to effectively investigate cases of human trafficking or to differentiate between smuggling clients and trafficking victims, which continued to obscure the nature and extent of the trafficking situation in Botswana. In 2009, the Botswana Police Service conducted 10 in-service training courses for its officers, during which students received lectures on combating human trafficking. A police officer in the National Central Bureau of Interpol was assigned to work exclusively on human trafficking issues and to educate police officers about the phenomenon; information on his specific anti-trafficking duties and the results of his work were unavailable. Protection The government showed evidence of minimal efforts to protect victims of trafficking. During the year, the government did not identify or provide assistance to any confirmed victims of trafficking, but provided shelter and social services to three Zimbabwean children and six illegal Indian migrants who officials believed to be targets of transnational traffickers. The government provided logistical and financial assistance to repatriate all nine individuals to their countries of origin. NGO-operated shelters which received government funding to provide services to children, including children in prostitution, may have provided assistance to trafficked children without identifying them as such. Law enforcement and social services personnel have not established formal procedures to proactively identify victims of trafficking among vulnerable populations or to refer identified victims for protective services, and foreign trafficking victims have been deported from Botswana. During the reporting period, IO M identified 594 unaccompanied minors at the reception center in Plumtree for Zimbabweans deported from Botswana and expressed concern that some of them may have been victims of trafficking Botswana has an extensive public medical system, which includes psychological care facilities, and a university-run legal clinic which provides legal assistance to victims of any crime. It is unclear whether any trafficking victims received assistance at these facilities in 2009. Botswana's laws do not specifically protect victims of trafficking from penalization for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked, but the government did not generally prosecute persons it believed to be victims of any crime. Prevention The government made moderate efforts to prevent trafficking in and through Botswana. During the reporting period, the government did not complete or implement a national anti- trafficking plan of action it began developing in 2008. The government continued its participation with NGOs in an anti-trafficking working group. During the reporting period, the working group raised the issue of trafficking in the local press and within the government; fostered communication on trafficking issues between the government, NGOs, and other stakeholders; and laid the groundwork for drafting and implementing anti-TI P legislation. It produced and disseminated anti-trafficking education posters at all of its border posts and included trafficking awareness segments in some of its law enforcement training sessions. In early 2009, a partnership of NGOs and representatives from the government's police, labor, and social services responsible for issues of child labor, including the trafficking of children for forced labor, formed a child labor task force that met regularly throughout the reporting period. In mid-2009, the government funded the salaries of two ILO consultants to advise the government on how to strengthen both its laws on worst forms of child labor and enforcement of those laws. The task force began developing definitions for what constitutes \\"hazardous work\\" under child labor statutes and recommended changes within existing laws to standardize the definition of a \\"child\\" under different statutes. During the year, the Ministry of Labor conducted child labor inspections and removed at least one child from a situation of exploitative child labor. The government made efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts, largely through a broad, well-publicized HIV /AIDS awareness campaign that discouraged commercial sex acts.

Tanner infers that Henry de Balnea was an Englishman from the fact that he quotes Hylton in English.

Life academic and journalistic  Son of a journalist, he began working in a small local newspaper for his father, before completing his studies in journalism at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul. Professionally, he started working in 1970 at the Journal of the Week, Sunday Publishing Group Editorial Sinos, as editor of football. Later, at the suggestion of journalist Paul St. Anne, he worked as a reporter for the paper Zero Hora, group RBS, at 19 years of age. In 1972, he moved to radio Gua√≠ba (belonging to the Junior Caldas), at the invitation of Peter Pereira Carneiro, where he became coordinator of the area and was head of sports journalism. In 1978, he left Gua√≠ba and returned to the RBS group and started working in the TV Gaucha. That same year he became a professor at the University of Vale do Rio dos Sinos (Unisinos), a position he held until 1979. RBS, passed in 1979 to further the editorial policy of the Rede Globo in Bras√≠lia, acting as a commentator and presenter. In early 1985, right after the election of Tancredo Neves for the presidency, he was asked to become press secretary for the new government. In this role, he served as spokesman of medical information on the health of the President, in the period just prior to his death on April 21, 1985. Early career policy Known through the television media and author of a book on the last days of Tancredo, he was invited by Ulysses Guimar√£es to join the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB), to which party he threw himself candidate federal deputy elections 1986, being elected with one of the largest votes in the state (and reelected in 1990). In the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil, he served in the preparation of the 1988 Constitution and was Chairman of the Committee on Science and Technology, Communication and Computing in the 1990-91 biennium. In 1988 he was appointed as the PMDB candidate for mayor of Porto Alegre, but despite the initial favoritism, faded and finished fourth in the election, which was won by Olivio Dutra (Workers Party, PT). In 1992, he was invited by President Itamar Franco to take the folder of the Social Welfare. In the presidential decision to upgrade the salaries of retirees, he was then very beneficial, which leveraged the national popularity and put him as one of the probable successors of Itamar own elections in 1994. However, before the government preferred to seek their own state, guiding the support of the PMDB's presidential candidacy to the local Fernando Henrique Cardoso (Social Democratic Party, PSDB), in contrast to the official party candidate, Orestes Quercia. In the first round of elections, he won 49.2% of the valid votes, against 34.7% of its main competitor, Dutra. In the second round, getting support from the Progressive Party (PPR) and part of the Democratic Labour Party (PDT) (then governor of Alceu Collares), he obtained 52.2% of the votes against 47.8% for Olivio. The polarization PMDB/PT in Rio Grande do Sul was repeated in the elections of 1998 and 2002. In 2016, Antonio Britto didn't take part in the voting concerning the impeachment of then president Dilma Rousseff. However, deputy Antonio Luiz Paranhos Ribeiro Leite de Brito, better known as Ant√¥nio Brito (PSD/BA), namesake of the former governor, participated in the vote. Government Britto The management ahead of the government of Rio Grande do Sul was marked by administrative reforms and a heated controversy with the opposition (led by the PT), which held the hegemony of the unions of servers, especially the CPERS, which combines the teaching state. This controversy was not limited to the salary issue, but included measures that Antonio Britto and his government have adopted to pursue the reorganization of state finances, which included the privatisation of the large municipalities of the state of public services, the Riograndense Telecommunications Company (telephony) and the State Company for Electric Energy, both established in the management of Brizola (1959-1962). For the supporters of government Britto, privatization would increase the scope of services, reducing the cost of installation. To his opponents, the fees charged by the privatized companies would become more expensive over time for the population, benefiting only a few specific business groups. Another focus of controversy was the policy of attracting major car companies to the state through tax relief, such as exemption from tax in the early years. To his opponents, the policy of attracting investments (involving the state in the \\"war tax\\" to other states) represented a loss to the treasury, not compensating for the generation of jobs. Another measure of the government, which Britto fought, was the creation of private road poles, which were granted to tolls, a measure that undermined its popularity in some localities. In banking, the government Britto held merger of two state banks, incorporating Caixa Econ√¥mica Estadual do Rio Grande do Sul by Banrisul. Some measures of privatizing Antonio Britto (which earned him the charge of \\"liberal\\" by its opponents), prior to privatization own federal government, the management of Fernando Henrique Cardoso. 1998 elections Politically, he sought to govern with a huge party base, isolating only the PT. This allowed the composition of a broad coalition of parties to the 1998 elections, when he ran for reelection by the PMDB. But in some cases favoring the PPB (who appointed his running mate, Jos√© Ot√°vio Germano) led to splits within his own party, which in some municipalities announced support for the PT. He even won the first round of elections by a small margin. But in the second round against his opponent again in 1994, Olivio Dutra (PT), he was defeated by a margin of 87,366 votes. In the election, there was decisive support of the PDT (the opposite of privatization) to the PT candidate. Business practices After the defeat in his bid for reelection, he worked in private practice as a consultant to the Telefonica of Spain, which led to suspicions of favoritism in the privatization of CRT in 1997. In 2001, still tipped as favorite for the succession of Olivio Dutra (who would not be running for reelection), Antonio Britto clashed with Sen. Peter Simon, the main regional leader of the PMDB, and ended up leaving the party. Then he joined the Socialist People's Party (PSP) (incipient state), along with its support base, and launched into a succession of state in 2002, in alliance with the Liberal Front Party (PFL) (PDT since refused to support it within the rule of \\"piggybacking\\" of coalitions in the states). However, the strong rejection of his name made their voting intentions \\"migrate\\" en masse for the candidate of the PMDB, Germano Rigotto. He came in third, with only 12% of the vote, while Rigotto defeated Tarso Genro (PT) in the second round, again bringing the PMDB, the state government. Since then, Britto announced his abandonment of politics, becoming director of the company Azal√©ia, and its president, after the death of its founder, Nestor de Paula, who approached the government for state. In 2005, he became involved in a national controversy when closing a factory unit in Rio Grande do Sul, laying off 800 employees, while opening a plant in China. Worn with the heirs of Nestor de Paula, on behalf of a conflicting relationship, in late 2006 he announced his withdrawal from Azal√©ia, by resignation. At Sure for Claro, he has been working in the area of corporate affairs, with the objective of organizing the company's relations with the external public and with Congress.

Men and women from Turkmenistan are subjected to conditions of forced labor in Turkey, including domestic servitude and also in textile sweatshops.\\"Turkmenistan\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The Government of Turkmenistan does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Because the determination that the Government of Turkmenistan is making significant efforts is based in part on the government‚Äôs commitments to take additional future steps over the next year, Turkmenistan was placed on Tier 2 Watch List for the second consecutive year. The government has indicated its commitment to implement the ‚ÄúLaw on Combating Trafficking in Persons,‚Äù adopted in December 2007. The law identifies responsible ministries within the government to combat trafficking, and requires authorities to develop measures to prevent trafficking, prosecute traffickers, and assist victims. During the next reporting period, the government has agreed to provide facility space for a foreign-funded shelter for trafficking victims to be operated by IOM, and has also formally agreed to work with IOM to conduct a human trafficking awareness program for students in all five provinces of the country. Although the government did not demonstrate any efforts to investigate or prosecute trafficking offenses during the reporting period, in May 2010 the government demonstrated significant political will by adopting amendments to the criminal code that prescribed penalties for all forms of human trafficking. The U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed Turkmenistan in \\"Tier 3\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Government of Turkmenistan demonstrated no significant law enforcement efforts during the reporting period. The government prohibits all forms of trafficking in persons through Article 129 of its criminal code ‚Äì adopted in May 2010 ‚Äì which prescribes penalties ranging from four to 25 years‚Äô imprisonment. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The government reported no efforts to investigate, prosecute, convict, or punish any trafficking offenders during the reporting period. During the previous reporting period, the government reportedly investigated and prosecuted two cases of trafficking under non-trafficking statutes, although the government provided no information on whether the individuals prosecuted in these cases were convicted or sentenced to time in prison. The General Prosecutor‚Äôs Office provided regular training for 10 to 15 prosecutors on trafficking in Ashgabat. Various international organizations also provided training for more than 100 officials from the State Migration, State Customs, and State Border Services on the legal anti-trafficking framework and general trafficking issues. Despite unconfirmed reports that some customs or migration officials were complicit in human trafficking, the government did not report efforts to investigate such officials for trafficking-related complicity. Although the Turkmenistan government did not form formal anti-trafficking partnerships with other foreign governments, it reportedly issued instructions to its foreign missions abroad to cooperate with foreign law enforcement authorities on trafficking cases. Protection During the reporting period the Government of Turkmenistan demonstrated no efforts to protect or assist victims. The government did not provide medical assistance, counseling, shelter, legal assistance, or rehabilitative services to victims of trafficking, nor did it supply funding to international organizations or NGO's to provide services to victims. However, in April 2010, the government pledged to donate facility space for a trafficking shelter that will be foreign-funded and operated by IOM. The 2007 trafficking law has provisions for victim care facilities and guarantees protection and assistance for victims of trafficking, though these elements of the law were unimplemented during the reporting period. In 2009, 25 victims were assisted by non-government funded organizations, compared with 20 victims assisted by non-government funded organizations in 2008. The government did not refer any victims to NGOs or IOM for assistance in 2009. Government personnel employed no formal victim identification procedures and did not provide victim identification, victim referral, or victim sensitivity training for border guards or police. The government did not encourage victims to assist in trafficking investigations or prosecutions. There were no reports of victims being punished during the reporting period for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their being trafficked. The government did not assist with the repatriation of foreign victims in 2009, and there were unconfirmed reports that some victims of trafficking were denied assistance by Turkmen consular officials in a destination country. Prevention The Government of Turkmenistan did not demonstrate significant efforts to prevent human trafficking during the reporting period. The government did not fund or conduct any anti-trafficking awareness campaigns in 2009, although Turkmen citizens traveling to Turkey received written contact information for anti-trafficking organizations operating in Turkey if travelers end up needing trafficking assistance. However, in April 2010, the Ministries of Education and Health, in cooperation with IOM, formally agreed to conduct an information campaign in public schools for young adolescents. The campaign will be carried out in all five provinces of Turkmenistan by representatives of non-governmental organizations using Turkmen language publications and stories that warn of the hazards of human trafficking. The government made regular efforts, however, to monitor the trafficking situation within its borders.

In these situations, parents, relatives, or other care- givers receive in-kind or financial compensation or other benefits from a child engaging in sexual activities. Reporting suggests the number of victims trafficked in, to, or through St. Vincent and the Grenadines is comparatively small. Information on the extent of human trafficking in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, however, is lacking, as the government has conducted no related investigations, studies, or surveys.\\"Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Despite these efforts, including the government‚Äôs public commitment to addressing human trafficking, the government did not provide evidence of law enforcement efforts to combat trafficking by investigating reports of the commercial sexual exploitation of children and of women who may be forced to engage in prostitution, nor did it provide more than minimal protection to victims or suspected victims or make any effort to prevent human trafficking during the year. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines made minimal progress in anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts over the last year. The government has no specific or comprehensive laws prohibiting trafficking in persons, although slavery and forced labor are both constitutionally prohibited. Trafficking offenders could be prosecuted under relevant provisions in immigration, prostitution, or labor laws, though there were no such efforts reported over the last year. Sufficiently stringent penalties for trafficking offenders under these laws range from 10‚Äì15 years‚Äô imprisonment and are commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious offenses. Law enforcement authorities showed no signs of proactively investigating or prosecuting suspected trafficking offenses under existing trafficking-related provisions in prostitution or labor laws. The government did not provide specialized training for law enforcement or other government officials in how to recognize, investigate, and prosecute instances of trafficking or trafficking victim identification. In November 2009, officials attended information seminars on regional trafficking issues. Twenty-five officials attended two days of workshops conducted by the International Organization for Migration and an expert in trafficking law in March 2010. The government received reports of two suspected trafficking cases during the past year, one involving foreign women who may have been victims of sex trafficking and one involving boys who claimed to have been victims of labor trafficking. In October 2009, immigration officers noted some potential female trafficking victims in a group attempting to transit St. Vincent and the Grenadines, began investigating their situation, and requested outside assistance to further their investigations. Officers were, however, required by law to deport the women before they could complete their inquiries either internally or with the governments of neighboring countries. In the other case, police detained a number of teenage boys during a drug raid who claimed they were subjected to forced labor by criminals involved in the production and sale of illegal drugs. Local prosecutors and police investigated the claims and determined the juveniles fabricated the allegations to escape prosecution for the drug- related offenses. Protection The Vincentian government did not show tangible progress in ensuring that victims of trafficking are identified and provided access to necessary services. The Ministry of Mobilization and Social Development, however, developed a referral process to transfer victims detained, arrested, or placed in protective custody by law enforcement authorities to institutions that provide short- or long-term care. The St. Vincent and the Grenadines Human Rights Association provided legal services and other limited aid to victims of any crime, and did not knowingly assist any victims of trafficking during the year. The government provided some funding and building space to three local NGO's whose shelter, counseling, and other services for all crime victims would also be available to trafficking victims. Government officials have no formal procedure for proactively identifying victims of trafficking for the purposes of forced labor or commercial sexual exploitation, but on the two occasions noted above individual law enforcement officials suspected trafficking may have occurred in conjunction with other suspicious activities. Under current laws, the government did not encourage victims‚Äô assistance in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking or other crimes, nor did it provide legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they would face hardship or retribution. St. Vincent and the Grenadines had no law or official procedures in place to ensure that victims would not be inappropriately incarcerated, fined, or otherwise penalized for unlawful offenses committed solely as a direct result of being trafficked. Prevention The government made minimal efforts to prevent trafficking and to increase the public‚Äôs awareness of the dangers of human trafficking in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. In 2009, the Prime Minister made the first-ever address to parliament on trafficking issues. The government did not conduct anti-trafficking information or education campaigns during the reporting period. It did not develop an anti-trafficking national plan of action, and did not establish an anti-trafficking working group. A foreign donor provided funds for the government to consult with a legal expert on drafting comprehensive anti-trafficking legislation that would be appropriate within the context of the country‚Äôs existing legal structure and in accordance with international agreements and standards. The consultant also provided two days of workshops on trafficking awareness and an anti-trafficking legislative structure. The government made no efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts. St. Vincent and the Grenadines is not a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.

Plot summary   Beginning  Our Nig opens with the story of Mag Smith, a white woman who lives in the northern United States. She has been seduced and left with a child born out- of-wedlock. After the child dies, Mag moves away to a place where no one knows her. In this new town, she meets a \\"kind-hearted African\\" man named Jim who falls in love with her. Impoverished, she soon realizes that she can either marry Jim or become a beggar. Jim and Mag marry and they have two children, a daughter, Frado, and an unnamed son. Jim becomes sick and dies, leaving Mag to provide for their children. Embittered, she allows Seth, one of Jim's business partners, to become her common-law husband. Eventually, Mag and Seth decide they must leave town to search for work, and do not want to take both of the children. He suggests they send her daughter Frado to live with and work for the Bellmonts, a lower middle-class white family who live nearby. Mag, indifferent, agrees. Six-year-old Frado is dropped off at the Bellmonts under the pretense that Mag will be back to pick her up later in the day. After a few days the Bellmonts, and Frado, realize Mag never intended to return. Mr. Bellmont is portrayed as kind and humane but Mrs. Bellmont is the complete opposite. The Bellmonts have four children, two boys, Jack and James (the latter of whom is not currently living with the family) and two girls (sickly Jane and irascible Mary). Mr. Bellmont's sister, Abby, also lives with the family. The family debates whether or not to keep Frado, and if they do, where she will sleep. Frado is sent to live in a separate part of the house that she will soon outgrow. The following day, Mrs. Bellmont calls for Frado early in the morning and puts her to work in the kitchen, washing dishes, preparing food, etc.  Life with the Bellmonts  Jack accepts Frado since her skin is not very dark. His sister Mary resents Frado being there and wants her to go to the County Home instead. Mrs. Bellmont is not happy with Frado living with them but puts her to work doing household chores, frequently upbraiding her and hitting her. Mr. Bellmont is more kindly, but does not wish to interfere with his wife's right to rule in the home and so does not protest Mrs. Bellmont's treatment of her. Frado now lives in a small room, an unfinished chamber over the kitchen. As a year passes, Frado accepts that she is part of the Bellmont family. Jack buys Frado a dog named Fido, who becomes her friend and eases her loneliness. Frado is allowed to attend school with Mary. One afternoon on their way home, Mary tries to force Frado into a stream but falls in instead. Mary runs home to tell her mother that Frado pushed her into the water. Frado receives a whipping from Mrs. Bellmont while Jack tries to defend the girl. Frado runs away; Mr. Bellmont, Jack and a visiting James search for her. After she is found she tells James that if God made him, Aunt Abby and Mrs. Bellmont white, then she dislikes God for making her black. On the first day of spring a letter arrives from James about his declining health. He returns with his wife and son to visit the family. Mrs. Bellmont beats Frado senseless and says if she tells James, Mrs. Bellmont will \\"cut her tongue out\\". By November, James' health starts to deteriorate further. Mary leaves home to nurse her brother Jake. James requests that Frado stay by his bed side until further notice. Mrs. Bellmont discovers Frado reading the Bible and speaks to her husband about Frado going to the evening meetings. James dies the following spring. Illness and sorrow After James' death, Frado suffers conflict, feeling she is unworthy to be in Heaven. She seeks the aid of Aunt Abby (Mr. Belmont's sister). She teaches Frado about God and the Bible, invites her to a church meeting, and encourages her to believe in God and seek the passage of Heaven. Mr. Bellmont grows concerned for Frado's health from her beatings by Mrs. Belmont, and advises Frado to avoid them whenever she can. Before Mrs. Bellmont strikes her for taking too long to bring firewood, Frado threatens to stop working for her if she does. Mrs. Bellmont unexpectedly relents. From there after, she whips the girl less frequently. News arrives that Mary Bellmont has died of illness. Frado rejoices in the death of her tormentor, and considers leaving the Bellmonts, but Aunt Abby counsels her against it. Frado decides to wait until her indenture contract is over at the age of 18. Over time, Jane Bellmont leaves the house. Jack moves in with his wife, whom Mrs. Bellmont verbally abuses because of her poverty in Jack's absence. Frado helps Jack's wife escape Mrs. Bellmont's tormenting. When Frado turns 18, arrangements are made for her to sew for the Moore family. Due to her ailing health, she slowly becomes unable to work. She moves to a shelter where two elderly women take care of her for two years. For a while, she is nursed by Mrs. Moore, but after her husband leaves, Frado is forced to find work. She eventually is employed by a poor woman in Massachusetts who instructs her on making bonnets.  Aftermath  Though growing feebler and declining in health, Frado makes substantial wages. Despite three years of failing health, a few years later Frado moves to Singleton. She marries a fugitive slave named Samuel but finds that her back has been more seriously marked by beatings than his. He constantly leaves her to go \\"lecture\\" on the abolitionist circuit. During his travels, Frado is at home with little money. She must depend on herself alone, especially during the birth of her child. During Samuel's absence, Frado becomes sick again. She takes her child and finds shelter in the home of a poor woman, where she later recovers. She receives word that her husband has died of yellow fever in New Orleans. Forced to find work, Frado travels through the different towns of Massachusetts. After a friend gives her a recipe for turning gray hair back to its original color, she maintains herself by making and selling the preparation. The third person narrator concludes the story by relating the destinies of all its characters. Mr. and Mrs. Bellmont, Aunt Abby, Jack, and his wife have all died. Jane and her husband Henry, Susan (James' wife) and her son all have become old. No one remembers Frado.

Wilson's Our Nig argues that Wilson's book was marginalized by a white audience because it appealed directly to a \\"colored audience.\\" The distribution of Our Nig: Sketches in the Life of a Free Black was limited, and not appreciated by northern abolitionists because Wilson called for awareness of the abuse and \\"shadow of slavery\\" that existed even in the Northern United States. Ernest asserts that Wilson risked undermining the paradigm that African-American narratives portrayed of the \\"New England ideal.\\"Ernest, John. \\"Economies of Identity: Harriet E.

Robin Bernstein in Racial Innocence: Performing American Childhood from Slavery to Civil Rights argued that the novel responds critically to Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel, Uncle Tom's Cabin, and to other works of abolitionist fiction that debate whether black children who die may become angels.Bernstein, Robin, Innocence: Performing American Childhood from Slavery to Civil Rights (New York: New York University Press, 2011), pp. 56‚Äì60. Cynthia J.

Davis includes other critics' comments and perspectives in order to come to her own conclusions. \\"One marker of the way in which Our Nig 'signifies' on dominant representations is the fact that, in light of the extreme sexualization of black women's bodies, it is a white woman whom Wilson represents as sexual ‚Äî Frado's mother Mag, but not Frado herself.\\" Wilson presents a challenging view of a white woman and a black woman. Although Frado is born to a white mother, because her father is black and she has identifiably African features, she is considered black. She defies convention, as she is not promiscuous. But, her white mother lost her virginity before marriage, had a child out of wedlock, and married twice. Eric Gardner's article, \\"'This Attempt of Their Sister': Harriet Wilson's Our Nig from Printer to Readers\\",Gardner, Eric, \\"'This Attempt of Their Sister': Harriet Wilson's Our Nig from Printer to Readers\\", The New England Quarterly, Vol. 66, No. 2 (June 1993), pp. 226‚Äì246. explores why the novel initially escaped notice and was not widely publicized. He argues that \\"of the owners of Our Nig who have been traced, more than half were children‚Ä¶\\" (238). Many white abolitionists were not as concerned with the issue of race as they were with the issue of slavery, and Our Nig may have seemed unflattering to Northerners and abolitionists in its content; \\"Wilson depicts aspects of Northern life that abolitionists would have regretted\\" (242). Gardner concludes that although Wilson may have not received the support she wanted or even needed, publishing Our Nig may have succeeded in aiding Wilson to reach her goal of achieving \\"self-sufficiency and self-satisfaction‚Ä¶\\" (246). She did gain a faithful group of supporters, however small. Lois Leveen's article, \\"Dwelling in the House of Oppression: The Spatial, Racial, and Textual Dynamics of Harriet Wilson's Our Nig\\",Leveen, Lois. \\"Dwelling in the House of Oppression: The Spatial, Racial, and Textual Dynamics of Harriet Wilson's 'Our Nig'\\",African American Review, Vol. 35, No. 4 (Winter 2001), pp. 561‚Äì580. incor rates her view on the \\"two story house\\" symbolizing the ties that bind her. The substandard space which Frado is given makes her believe in her low status. She starts to believe that she must fit within these spatial restrictions. Frado knows only what she has been surrounded by; the Bellmonts and others in their society believe the individual is determined by race. Frado can't break the chains of this household where such inhumane conditions are set, so breaking the chains in her mind would be equally, if not more difficult, to escape. The physical prison which she has been doomed to live in, translates into her mental incapacity. Although she leaves the \\"white house,\\" due to the damage and treatment she received there, she will never be truly free. Growing up, that environment is all Frado knew, it's all the familiarity that she had to compare every other upcoming experience to. The fact that she grew up in the North, a free place, further incapacitates her. For there is no escape for her, there is no geographical positive. She has no sense of freedom because she was raised as a prisoner in a free land and was cheated out of ever claiming it. She had no choices, she had no will, she had only her thoughts and her pain to look to. She can leave the walls that held her restrained in the past but she cannot leave her mind, thoughts and memories; they hold her eternally captive. Reception Our Nig did not sell well because rather than criticizing slavery in the South, it indicts the economy of the north, specifically: the practice of keeping poor people as indentured servants, and the poor treatment of blacks by whites. Critic David Dowling, in \\"Other and More Terrible Evils: Anticapitalist Rhetoric in Harriet Wilson's Our Nig and Proslavery Propaganda\\", states that the northern abolitionists did not publicize her book because it criticized the North.

He belonged to the famed Zagar Mengal tribe and was the nephew of the Baloch National Poet Mir Gul Khan Nasir. His father's name was Mir Lal Bakhsh Mengal and he had seven siblings. His mother was a prominent member of the Gichki family from Mekran. Early life Mir Noor-ud- din was named after Sardar Noordin Mengal (an uncle of Sardar Attaullah Mengal and a close friend of Mir Lal Baksh Mengal who died in a road traffic accident near Kalat). He was brought up in his hometown of Kalat. His father was a prominent tribal and political figure of Balochistan while his uncle Gul Khan Nasir belonged to the top tier Baloch leadership along with Ghaus Bakhsh Bizenjo, Abdul Aziz Kurd and, later, Sardar Ataullah Khan Mengal and Khair Bux Marri.Warsa i Nasiriyat p3All local newspapers of Balochistan dated 14 October 2010 As a result of this he was exposed to politics from a very early age. This exposure instilled a nascent sense of political awareness in him which, with age, kept growing. Mengal passed high school from Kalat and after matriculating from Noshki, enrolled in F.Sc Pre-Engineering in Government Science College, Quetta.Balochistan National Party Movement published in memory of Mir Nooruddin Mengal Shaheed After he had finished college, Gul Khan Nasir advised Mengal to get into a university instead of just relying on a college degree. Following his uncle's advice, he applied to Patrice Lumumba University and was accepted. Mengal had chosen a University in Moscow because at that time it was a very common practice for Baloch students to go to Russia in pursuit of a higher education but because of his political activities (which he had already begun by 1970 from Baloch Students Organization's (BSO) platform) his name was put on the Exit Control List and he was unable to go. With that door closed, Mengal applied for Mining Engineering at University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore in 1973 and was, once again, accepted. He spent four years in Lahore and graduated with a B.E Degree in 1977. Politics Throughout his student life, Mengal had been active in politics and from 1974 to 1976 had served as BSO's Vice Chairman. During his time in Lahore he had opened sixteen units of BSO in different cities of Punjab. After returning to Quetta he served a second term as the Vice Chairman of BSO from 1978 to 1980 and while he managed to secure a job as a Mining Engineer in a private mining company, his political life remained dominant over his professional life. So much so, in fact, that he eventually quit his job to devote all his time and energy to politics. Nooruddin Mengal giving a speech in Lahore as the Vice Chairman of BSO. Mahmud Ali Kasuri (left) is sitting beside him. After serving his second term as the Vice Chairman of BSO, he joined the political party of Ghaus Bakhsh Bizenjo, The Pakistan National Party. After Mir Ghaus Bakhsh's death in August 1989, the leadership of the party shifted to Mir Bizen Bizenjo but he wasn't able to hold on to it for long. When Mir Bizen vacated the office of the Party President, PNP was thrown into turmoil. During this tumultuous time the position of Party Organizer was also vacant, so Mir Noor-ud-din Mengal was named the Organizer of the Party. After successfully organizing the council session of PNP where Mir Hasil Bizenjo was named President, Mengal went back to being the Deputy Organizer of the Party while Raziq Bugti became the Organizer. A few months after this, in 1992, Mir Noor-ud-din was elected as the Vice President of PNP, an office he held until the merger of PNP with BNM in 1996. By 1996 it seemed that no single political party was able to represent the whole Province of Balochistan. In light of this discussions began between the leaders of Pakistan National Party and Baloch National Movement. Mengal played a central role in these talks and was pivotal in the merger of the two parties to form Balochistan National Party.BNP statement released in Daily Jang Quetta, Daily Express Quetta, Daily ustmaan Quetta and Daily Intekhab Quetta dated 14 October 2010 Mir Noor-ud-din was elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee of BNP after the merger and held the position until his death in October 2010. Mengal remained an active and loyal member of the BNP right up until his death. When the Balochistan National Party was split into two factions, i.e., BNP Awami which was a forward block led by Israr Zehri, and BNP which was led by Akhtar Mengal, Mir Noor-ud-din remained in BNP proving his loyalty. He set up his political base in his hometown of Kalat and was arrested and persecuted for his political beliefs numerous times from 2000 to 2007 . In 2006, Balochistan National Party announced a Long March against, what they termed, the continued exploitation of the Baloch land and people by the Establishment especially during the dictatorship of General Pervez Musharaff. The long march was to start from Gwadar and culminate at Quetta. Before the long march could even begin, the Government launched a crackdown against the BNP Leaders. Party President Akhtar Mengal was the first to be arrested triggering protests throughout Balochistan. After Akhtar Mengal's arrest Mir Noor-ud-din Mengal was chosen as the Acting President of BNP. On 3 January 2007 he too was arrested while en route to Khuzdar to meet incarcerated party workers. Political cases under 16 M.P.O were registered against him and he was put under physical remand in Quetta for a month after which he was shifted to Khuzdar Jail where he was detained for four more months. After being released, Mir Noor-ud-din Mengal began preparing to take part in the upcoming 2008 elections. He submitted his papers for the National Assembly Seat from Kalat but the All Parties Democratic Movement (APDM, an alliance of several political parties against General Musharaff's regime) announced to boycott the electionsThe Daily Times Pakistan 25 November 2007 and since BNP was also a part of APDM, therefore all the BNP candidates withdrew their candidacy. Akhtar Mengal was released in 2008 after a change of regime and went to Dubai for treatment of a disease he had contracted while in detention. So in his absence the party was being run by Habib Jalib Baloch, Dr Jahanzaib Jamaldini and Mir Noor-ud-din Mengal. In 2010 the BNP Leaders began receiving death threats and the threats were put into action for the first time when a BNP worker, Naseer Langove, was murdered in May 2010. A group named Baloch Musallah Difaee Tanzeem (Baloch Armed Defence Organization) claimed the responsibility for the murder and issued a statement claiming that their intended target had been Habib Jalib. On 14 July 2010 the shadow organization struck again, this time succeeding in assassinating Jalib in front of his house in Quetta. Only four days later another BNP Leader Haji Liaquat Mengal was assassinated near his house in Kalat. Assassination After the death of Habib Jalib Mir Noor-ud-din Mengal was the man directing the affairs of Balochistan National Party in the absence of Akhtar Mengalhttp://news.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the- newspaper/front-page/bnpm-leader-shot-dead-in-kalat-400 and he was also one of the few top leaders of the party who wasn't keeping private security guards with him. On 13 October 2010 he had gone to the market in Kalat to get his Blood Pressure checked. As soon as he got back and turned his car into the gate of his house, unknown gunmen riding a motorcycle came up behind him and opened indiscriminate fire upon him. He was hit by three bullets; One in the neck and two in the back.The Daily Jang Quetta 14th october, 2010 He was immediately rushed to the local hospital but none of the doctors who were supposed to be on duty were there. Mengal was sent to Quetta without being given basic first aid. He died on the way to Quetta due to profuse bleeding. He had been conscious for nearly 75 minutes after being shot. As the news of his death spread in Balochistan, the traffic began thinning on the roads from the fear of riots erupting. Mengal was buried beside his father's grave in Kalat the same evening. Hundreds of people flocked to attend his funeral.The Daily Intekhab Quetta 14 October 2010http://news.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the- newspaper/front-page/bnpm-leader-shot-dead-in-kalat-400 The Daily Dawn Karachi 14 October 2010 His death was assailed by all the local and national political parties such as the Pakistan National Party, the Awami National Party, Pakhtun-khwa Milli Awami Party, Balochistan National Party, Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz, Pakistan Muslim League Quaid-i Azam, the Baloch National Front, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam and the Pakistan People's Party.All the newspapers of Quetta dated 14 and 15 October 2010.

She focused on prosecuting illegal aliens who had been convicted of a felony and had been deported, but who had returned to the United States and committed another felony crime. Later, Christiansen's focus at the United States Attorney's changed and she began prosecuting child exploitation, child pornography and other violent crime cases. She handled several rape cases and other child sexual abuse cases involving Native Americans on reservations. Forster left the U.S. Attorney's Office in January 2005 when she was appointed as the executive director of the Utah Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice (CCJJ) by Jon Huntsman, Jr., Utah's newly elected governor.

Summaries of selected legal cases   Assistant United States Attorney  _U.S. v. MABE_ , 330 F. Supp. 2d 1234; (Ut. Dist. Ct. 2004) In this case, Ms. Forster was acting a prosecutor for the United States through the United States Attorneys' office. The Utah Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force was notified of individuals who had purchase material through Sitekey, a website that involved orders for child pornography. Lester Jay Mabe was one of those individuals. Defendant was interviewed at his work place, and the officers asked the defendant for his cooperation. He then gave them consent to search \\"all areas of the apartment to include personal P.C.\\". He showed the officers where the illicit materials were kept. Other member of the task force showed up and the officers took him to the FBI's Salt Lake City office. Defendant complied with the questions asked by the officers, but did not sign the Advice of Rights form. Defendant admitted to purchasing the images off the internet with his credit card. Defendant insisted that he was incarcerated following his statements given in the interview, that violated his Miranda rights, and the evidence from his apartment was not obtained within the limitations of his consent. In an earlier case, the U.S. Supreme Court held that consent cannot be considered legally valid consent after the officer claims to already have a warrant to search. However, the decision was changed in later cases. Various factors must be considered when arguing if a search is consented to under the guise of law enforcement already having permission is lawful. The defendant also wanted to suppress his statements made at the FBI's office due to a Miranda rights violation. The court ruled that the statements and evidence from the search of his apartment could be suppressed, but the statements made at the FBI office were taken after the defendant was read his Miranda rights and therefore cannot be suppressed. For more information on this case see: U.S. vs Mabe decision _U.S. vs. Paul_ , 313 F. Supp. 2d 1157; (Ut. Dist. Ct. 2003) In U.S. vs Paul, Ms. Forster represented the federal government in a prosecution involving illegal drugs. The defendant, Danielle Paul, wanted to suppress evidence gathered from a search of her vehicle and self as well as statements made during the stop made by Officer Sean McCarthy. The officer noticed that the defendant did not use her blinker for three seconds preceding her changing lanes. He stopped her and asked for her information. The defendant gave her sister's name and information, and claimed to not possess her driver's license at the time of the stop. The officer ran her credentials and noticed that Michelle Paul, the sister of the defendant, had her driver's license denied. He decided to issue a citation for driving on a denied license. This is when Officer Stohel arrived from a nearby stop. He was asked to \\"stick around\\" by Officer McCarthy. The defendant was issued a citation for improper lane change, driving on a denied license, and not having her driver's license. Then there was some confusion when Officer McCarthy asked to search her car. The two officer's stories aligned that the defendant gave permission to search the car both verbally and nonverbally, when asked to clarify her verbal consent. The defendant's testimony concerned the search was a very different account than those given by the police officers. Officer McCarthy discovered a burnt marijuana joint. He arrested the defendant, read her the Miranda rights, and searched her person. He discovered a bag of methamphetamine. He searched the car further and found more methamphetamine and a loaded weapon. The defendant insisted that she was not read her Miranda rights by Officer McCarthy. Therefore, she claims that all evidence and statements should be suppressed due to the unlawful stop, being unlawfully detained, lack of voluntary consent to search vehicle and that the evidence \\"was tainted by prior police illegality\\". The court believed the officers' story and denied the suppression of the statements and evidence gathered by the search. For more information about this case, see: U.S. vs. Paul Decision  Court of Appeals Judge  _Gish vs Yanke_ : 2010 UT App 259; No. 20081037-CA. September 23, 2010 Opinion written by Michele M. Christiansen: Appellant, Rodney J. Yanke appealed from the trial court's decision to enforce a property division agreement. Yanke claimed that he was not given sufficient time to consult his counsel before signing the agreement and that he was forced into signing the contract. The trial court determined that Appellant's testimony regarding the making of the agreement was not credible. The defendant also claimed that the trial court erred in properly classifying and dividing the marital property. On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's enforcement of the agreement and found that Yanke's arguments related to property classification and division were invalid. Shelley Gish filed a cross-appeal arguing that the trial court's finding that the wedding ceremony held in Mexico did not create a valid marriage in the state of Utah. The trial court decision was upheld by the Court of Appeals. A copy of the opinion can be found at:Gish vs. Yanke Opinion.

Swazi girls, particularly orphans, are subjected to commercial sexual exploitation and involuntary domestic servitude in the cities of Mbabane and Manzini, as well as in South Africa and Mozambique. Swazi boys are trafficked within the country for forced labor in commercial agriculture and market vending. Some Swazi women are forced into prostitution in South Africa and Mozambique after voluntarily migrating to these countries in search of work. Chinese organized crime units transport some Swazi victims to Johannesburg, South Africa, where victims are \\"distributed\\" locally or sent overseas for subsequent exploitation. Traffickers reportedly force Mozambican women into prostitution in Eswatini, or else transit Eswatini with their victims en route to South Africa. Mozambican boys migrate to Eswatini for work washing cars, herding livestock, and portering; some of these boys subsequently become victims of trafficking. Information on the full extent of trafficking in Eswatini is not yet available, as the government is still carrying out research into the scope and nature of the problem.\\"Swaziland\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The Government of Eswatini does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. This assessment is based in part on the government's commitment to undertake additional action over the coming year, particularly enforcement of its newly enacted comprehensive anti-trafficking legislation. The U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2 Watchlist\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Swazi government increased its capacity to conduct anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts, although no suspected trafficking offenders were arrested or prosecuted during the reporting period. In 2009, the government enacted comprehensive anti-human trafficking legislation, which provides for the prosecution of trafficking offenders and protections for victims, including immunity from prosecution for immigration violations. The People Trafficking and People Smuggling (Prohibition) Act, 2009 became effective in December 2009. The legislation considers consent and past sexual behavior of the trafficked persons to be immaterial, and incorporates provisions against money laundering as a way to identify persons involved in human trafficking. The Act covers both internal and transnational forms of trafficking and provides for victim restitution through the forfeiture of convicted offenders' movable property. The law prescribes penalties for all forms of trafficking, including the act of facilitating trafficking offenses, of up to 20 years' imprisonment, plus a fine determined by the court to compensate the victim for his or her losses; these penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Likewise, the prescribed penalties of up to 25 years' imprisonment for trafficking children for any purpose are also sufficiently stringent. The government began educating officials and law enforcement officers on the provisions of the new law, and the media reported that officers had begun making inquiries into possible trafficking situations. Police investigated one possible trafficking situation, though no arrests were made in connection with the case and further information was not available. The government did not provide any specialized training in victim identification for law enforcement and immigration personnel, though it began planning for such future training. Protection The Government of Eswatini took initial steps to create greater capacity for protecting trafficking victims, though it did not identify or assist any victims during the reporting period. Procedures for the government to provide victims with access to legal, medical, and psychological services were not implemented during the reporting period. The Anti-Trafficking Task Force, however, began developing such procedures, as well as formal procedures on the proactive identification of victims for law enforcement, immigration, and social services personnel. The Task Force also investigated how it can best be prepared to provide assistance to repatriated Swazi trafficking victims who had been identified in foreign countries. Eswatini's new anti-trafficking law empowers the government, by notice in an official gazette, to declare any house or building a place of refuge for the care and protection of trafficking victims, though the government did not open such victim care centers in Eswatini during the reporting period. Existing halfway houses run by the government and NGOs to shelter abused, abandoned, and vulnerable children and women victims of domestic violence could provide assistance to victims of trafficking. Policies on issues such as the victim's right to civil redress are under development. The government did not offer foreign victims alternatives to their removal to countries where they may face danger or hardship. Prevention During the year, the government increased its efforts to prevent trafficking. The Prime Minister created the Task Force for the Prevention of People Trafficking and People Smuggling in July 2009, which includes representatives from multiple government and law enforcement agencies, UNICEF and UNDP, and NGOs focused on assisting women, children, victims of crime, and other vulnerable populations. The Task Force met regularly, and began developing a national plan of action and various standard operating procedures. Government officials, accompanied by Task Force members, conducted seminars about what the nature of human trafficking and discussed the proposed legislation in all four regions of the country in 2009. The Prime Minister launched Eswatini's branch of the regional \\"Red Light 2010 Campaign\\", building on publicity surrounding the 2010 FIFA World Cup soccer championship in South Africa, to mobilize trafficking prevention activities. All Swazi media covered the meetings extensively. The Swazi government created an anti- trafficking hotline for victims needing assistance, and for the public to report suspected occurrences of trafficking. The hotline will be managed by the police domestic violence unit and connect to investigators and caregivers as needed. In 2009, officials from Mozambique, South Africa, and Eswatini held meetings to discuss ways of reducing demand for commercial sex acts in relation to the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. Eswatini is not a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.

ComC (Santa Comba D√£o, 25 June 1787 - Santa Comba D√£o, 4 September 1872) was a Portuguese nobleman, military and politician. He was the eldest child and son and successor of Ant√≥nio de Sousa de Macedo Almeida e Vasconcelos and Maria Hip√≥lita Cassiana da Flor da Rosa da Cunha Gusm√£o e Figueiredo. Life He enlisted as a Cadet in the Infantry Regiment 11 and was promoted to Alferes on 22 August 1808. He was elected a Deputy for the circle of Santa Comba D√£o in the Vintism to the Constituent Cortes of 1820, and ascended to Colonel of Infantry of the extinct Militias of Tondela on 27 September 1823. He was created a Fidalgo Knight of the Royal Household by Alvar√° of 13 July 1825 and a Commander of the Order of Christ. The concession of the title of 1st Baron of Santa Comba D√£o was by and after his marriage by Decree of 8 September 1825 of John VI of Portugal. His Coat of Arms was quartered, on the first de Sousa do Prado, on the second de Almeida, on the third de Macedo and on the fourth de Vasconcelos (sometimes the third and fourth appear vice versa) with Crest of de Sousa do Prado and a Coronet of Baron. He was a partidary and always followed the cause of Miguel of Portugal, who by Decree of 18 March 1829 appointed him the 55th Governor and Captain General of the Province of Angola (with capital at S√£o Paulo de Luanda, where his children were born), where he struggled with the greatest hardships, lack of resources of all kind, which the Metropole, handling the civil fights (it is not known if he had the chance of taking part in the conflict while at Portugal between 1828 and 1829), could not send him. However, he remained in the hard exercise of his office until the acclamation of Maria II of Portugal in 1834, when a Military Junta took over the office until 1836 and thanks to the Concession of Evoramonte he retired with his family unharmed and without being prosecuted nor deprived of any received honour. Meanwhile, he had become Lord of several Majorats and Lord of the House or Pa√ßo of os Arcos, all in Santa Comba D√£o, Santa Comba D√£o, succeeding in the House to his father on 21 October 1833, and returned to Santa Comba D√£o to take over his estates. He was elected Deputy for the circle of Santa Comba D√£o to the Legislatura of the Cortes Gerais of 1842-1845, in a time when the government of Ant√≥nio Jos√© Severim de Noronha, 1st Duke of Terceira that came out of the coup d'√©tat of 1842 also included Miguelists, but he never took seat. He resided in Santa Comba D√£o. His Majorats became extinct with the Letter of Law of 19 May 1863 that came to abolish all the Majorats and Chapels, excepting, with Article 13th, the House of Braganza.

Some women and girls from Colombia, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and Suriname who had been in prostitution in Trinidadian brothels and clubs have been identified as trafficking victims. Trinidadian trafficking victims have been identified in the United Kingdom and the United States. Undocumented economic migrants from the region and from Asia may be vulnerable to forced labor and forced prostitution. As a hub for regional travel, Trinidad and Tobago also is a potential transit point for trafficking victims traveling to Caribbean and South American destinations.\\"Trinidad and Tobago\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The Government of Trinidad and Tobago does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Despite these efforts, Trinidad and Tobago is placed on Tier 2 Watch List because the government did not show progress in prosecuting and punishing trafficking crimes and protecting trafficking victims, whom the government often jailed and deported. The government‚Äôs formation of a working group to substantively address its human trafficking problem portends good prospects for future improvements, and if effective legislation were adopted and enforced, the government would be poised to take the further steps in prosecuting trafficking cases and identifying and assisting victims. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Prosecution The anti-trafficking task force, which is co-chaired by an official from the Ministry of National Security in partnership with IOM, has been overseeing the implementation of a nine-month anti-trafficking action plan and organized three subcommittees: one to draft legislation, one to develop victim assistance policies, and a third to raise public awareness; however, the government made no discernible progress in its prosecution and punishment of sex and labor trafficking offenders during the reporting period. The lack of comprehensive legislation that would make human trafficking a crime and would ensure protection of trafficking victims was a significant limitation in the government‚Äôs ability to prosecute trafficking offenders and address human trafficking in Trinidad and Tobago during the reporting period. The government reported no prosecutions, convictions, or sentences of trafficking offenders. The government reported one trafficking investigation during the year, and it began extradition proceedings in February 2010 against a foreign national wanted for human trafficking in another country. The government provided logistical, human resources, and some financial support to IOM anti- trafficking training for police, immigration officers, police, and other officials during the reporting period. Protection The government made minimal progress in protecting victims during the reporting period. The government did not employ systematic procedures for law enforcement authorities to proactively identify victims and refer them to available services; however, in a positive step, some law enforcement officers are reported to have taken suspected victims to shelters. The task force recently began development of guidelines for officials to refer potential victims to shelter, counseling, medical care, and interpreter assistance. The government did not provide foreign trafficking victims with legal alternatives to their removal to countries where they may face hardship or retribution. The government did not report proactively identifying any victims during the reporting period. NGOs identified foreign trafficking victims in jail for immigration or other violations committed as a direct result of being trafficked that were later deported. The government offered some social services directly and through NGOS that received government funding, but due to a lack of a formal procedures to guide officials in victim identification and referral to services, few victims received assistance. Trinidadian authorities encouraged crime victims in general to assist with the investigation and prosecution of offenders, though without legislation criminalizing human trafficking or formal trafficking victim protection provisions there were few incentives for victims to assist. Prevention The government made some progress in preventing human trafficking during the reporting period through the establishment of the anti-trafficking task force. While the government did not conduct public awareness activities during the reporting period, the responsible subcommittee developed plans to implement a trafficking victim hotline and nationwide information campaign. While prostitution is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, the government did not take additional measures to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts during the reporting period. Authorities did not consider child sex tourism to be a problem in Trinidad and Tobago during the reporting period and reported no prosecutions related to child sex tourism.

Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The Government of Tunisia does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Despite these efforts, the government did not show evidence of progress in prosecuting and convicting trafficking offenders, proactively identifying or protecting trafficking victims, or raising public awareness of human trafficking over the last year; therefore, Tunisia is placed on Tier 2 Watch List for the second consecutive year. The Tunisian government does not identify human trafficking as a problem in Tunisia. Victims of trafficking likely remain undetected because of a lack of effort to identify them among vulnerable groups. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Government of Tunisia made no discernible antihuman trafficking law enforcement progress over the reporting period. Tunisia's Penal Code prohibits some forms of human trafficking. The Penal Code prescribes punishments of 10 years' imprisonment for capturing, detaining, or sequestering a person for forced labor, and up to five years' imprisonment for forced prostitution of women and children. The Penal Code also criminalizes child prostitution. The prescribed penalties for forced labor are sufficiently stringent. The penalty for forced prostitution ‚Äì five years' imprisonment ‚Äì is sufficiently stringent, though not commensurate with penalties prescribed under Tunisian law for other serious offenses, such as rape. In addition to these laws the Penal Code prescribes one to two years' imprisonment for forced child begging. There were no investigations or prosecutions of trafficking offenses, or convictions of trafficking offenders, during the year; however, a Tunis court convicted and sentenced a Tunisian trafficker in April 2009. A press report indicated that the police opened an investigation into reports that a group of children had been sexually exploited by Libyan tourists. There is no evidence that the government provided anti-trafficking training to law enforcement officials in the reporting period. There is no evidence of official tolerance of or complicity in trafficking in persons. Protection The government did not offer trafficking victims access to shelters or other services during the reporting period. The government lacked formal procedures to identify trafficking victims among vulnerable groups, such as undocumented migrants and those persons detained for prostitution offenses. As a result, persons whose trafficking victim status was not recognized by Tunisian authorities were vulnerable to imprisonment and deportation if caught engaging in illegal activities under Tunisian law. The government neither undertook efforts to identify trafficking victims among the undocumented migrants in its detention centers, nor did it allow outside parties to screen these detained migrants to determine if any were victims of abuse. The government's social workers provided direct assistance to abused migrant women and children ‚Äì including possible trafficking victims ‚Äì in two shelters operated by a local NGO. The Ministry of Women's Affairs, Family, Children, and Elderly Persons continued to assign a child protection delegate to each of Tunisia's 24 districts to intervene in cases of sexual, economic, or criminal exploitation of children; these delegates ensured that child sex abuse victims received adequate medical care and counseling. The government does not offer trafficking victims legal alternatives to their removal to countries where they may face hardship or retribution. Prevention The Tunisian government made no discernible efforts to prevent trafficking during the reporting period; there were no government campaigns to raise public awareness of trafficking. Tunisia took steps to reduced demand for commercial sex acts by enforcing laws against prostitution and arresting ‚Äúclients‚Äù soliciting commercial sex; however, these measures also resulted in the detention of women in prostitution, including possible trafficking victims. The government did not provide anti-trafficking training for military troops prior to their deployment on international peacekeeping missions.

It lies in a wood on a ridge about 150 m above the Oder valley. For centuries after its construction in the 10th or 11th century it remained an impregnable fortress. The inner ward is built on a dolomite rock outcrop about 20 m high. The castle was first captured after a siege in 1761 during the Seven Years' War and then blown up. The upper ward on a dolomite rock outcrop and its access stairway  Construction  Of the fortifications of the former outer ward nothing visible remains apart from a well house. The lower or outer ward is now a flat terraced area with a tourist restaurant. From the outer ward a stairway, built in the 19th century, leads to the upper ward on the 20-metre-high dolomite rock. The rock has an area of about 20 metres √ó 60 metres. This eyrie-like position with its vertical rock faces made the castle impregnable. The stone castle buildings were built on top of the rock or in gaps. According to contemporary accounts, there was at least a palas and a tower. Of the buildings and the defensive wall only preserved fragments remain that have now been restored. In contrast, the tunnels and rooms hewn out of the rock still exist, including the 15-metre-long corridor that runs from the castle entranceway. Several hundred metres away from the castle ruins is the rock known as the Frauenstein, which was once an observation tower and an outwork.

H.jpg|Postcard with views of the castle ruins  History   Emergence in the Middle Ages  The castle of Scharzfels was probably built in the 10th or 11th century and belonged in its early days to the Magdeburg archdiocese. It only became of historical significance through Emperor Lothair of S√ºpplingenburg who acquired it in 1131 and turned it into an imperial fort (reichsfeste). This purchase is witnessed by the same document in which the castle is mentioned in writing for the first time, as Castrum quoddam Scartuelt.Emil v. Ottenthal, Hans Hirsch.: Die Urkunden Lothars III. und der Kaiserin Richenza. In: Monumenta Germaniae Historica, Die Urkunden der deutschen K√∂nige und Kaiser, Vol. 8. Berlin 1927. No. 31, p. 47f. From that time the castle was home to several lines of counts, including the counts of Scharzfeld who were named after the castle. After they had become extinct, the castle went in 1300 as a fief of the Principality of Grubenhagen into the possession of the counts of Hohnstein. After the extinction of the Harz-based line of the House of Hohnstein in 1593, the feudal castle and house returned to the House of Grubenhagen. In 1596 Duke Henry Julius of Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel inherited the fortress. Later it passed into the possession of the Hanover line of the House of Welf.  Fortress and gaol  Merian copperplate of the castle In 1627 the castle was expanded, occupied by a garrison and heavily fortified. In the centuries after the construction of the castle no enemy power was able to capture it, despite conflicts such as the Peasants' War and the Thirty Years' War. In the 17th century Scharzfels became a state gaol. From 1695 Eleonore of the Knesebeck (born 1655) resided here, who came from a prestigious ancient L√ºneburg family, albeit of the lesser nobility. She became the maid to Princess Sophia of Ahlden after Sophia's marriage in 1682. Between the vulnerable sixteen-year-old, Sophie Dorothea, who had married into the House Hanover, and Eleanor a friendly relationship developed, a sort of mother-daughter relationship, and she was a confidante in the extra-marital love affair of her mistress with the reckless Count of K√∂nigsmarck, serving as a letter bearer. The family of Eleanor of the Knesebeck tried again and again to initiate a legal process and sought in vain for a bail of 100,000 talers. The prisoner remained incarcerated in a tiny room, only being allowed to see an old nurse once a day. Her family eventually bribed the roofer, Veit Rentsch. As a result, Eleanor was freed in 1697 with outside help in a daring rescue action, being lowered about 20 metres down from the high castle rock, her body being tied to the body of her rescuer, who abseiled with her. Previously, he had made an opening in the roof of the room where the prisoner was held and hauled her out with a rope. Below, her brother waited with a handful of mounted men and carried them to safety. She traveled to Vienna, where she managed secure an imperial letter of protection and drove to Brunswick. In 1717 she died in a village near this city. From the family of her former mistress, she received 2,000 talers in support.http://www.von-dem- knesebeck.org/intern/750jahre.htmlThea Leitner: Skandal bei Hof, Ueberreuter, 1993,  Capture  Rock tunnels on the upper ward View over the defensive wall to Barbis In 1761, during the Seven Years' War, a body of French troops, numbering some 6,000 men, appeared in front of Scharzfels Castle. They succeeded in forcing the surrender of the castle which had been defended by 40 gunners, 100 infantry from the Harz and 250 invalids from Hanover. When the defenders refused to give up voluntarily, the French attacked the castle with an assault and bombardment, but met with no success. As the result of a tip- off about a hidden path to the Liethberg a hill in the vicinity, the French were able to destroy the outwork at Frauenstein by shelling and then bombard the castle. After a ten-day siege, the garrison surrendered the castle on 25 September 1761. The capture of this hitherto impregnable fortress caused great jubilation in Paris. Their joy was dampened somewhat when it became known that the defenders were largely invalids. After only four days' occupation the French blew up the castle and withdrew when it became known that Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick was advancing on Scharzfels. Since that time, the castle site has lain in ruins.  Walking and climbing  Scharzfels Castle is no. 151 in the system of checkpoints in the Harzer Wandernadel hiking network; it lies on the Karst Trail and Harzer Baudensteig trail. The north face of the dolomite rock is used for climbing.  References   Sources  *Friedrich, Ernst Andreas (1992). Wenn Steine reden k√∂nnten.

At Padua he formed the acquaintance of the Alberto Fortis, who had recently returned from an exploration of Zara, Spalato, and other towns upon the Dalmatian coast, and from information supplied by him he made several communications to the Society of Antiquaries upon the Roman inscriptions and antiquities of Dalmatia and Istria (see Arch√¶ologia, iii. v. and vi.), a district then little known to Western Europe. In addition to further communications to the Arch√¶ologia, Strange contributed a number of papers to the Philosophical Transactions, the most important being \\"An Account of the Origin of Natural Paper found near Cortona in Tuscany\\" (vol. lix.). This was translated into Italian, and considerably expanded in \\"Lettera sopra l'origine della carta naturale di Cortona\\" (Pisa, 1764, and again, enlarged, 1765); \\"An Account of some Specimens of Sponges from Italy\\" (March 1770, lx. 177, with several plates from his drawings). This appeared in Italian as \\"Lettera del Signor Giovanni Strange, contenente la descrizione di alcune spugne\\" (ap. Olivi, Zoologica Adriatica, 1792, 4to); \\"An Account of a Curious Giant's Causeway newly discovered in the Euganean Hills, near Padua\\" (1775, lxv. 4, 418); an Italian version appeared at Milan, 1778, 4to; and \\"An Account of the Tides in the Adriatic\\" (vol. lxvii.). Several of his papers were also printed in the Opuscoli scelti sulle scienze (1778, &c.;); and his geological papers appeared in Weber's Mineralogische Beschreibungen (Berne, 1792). Meanwhile, in November 1773 he was appointed British resident at Venice, where his official duties left leisure for the pursuit of his antiquarian studies. He resigned his diplomatic post in 1788, and settled at Ridge, near Barnet. But he paid several further visits to Italy in connection with the transportation of the valuable collections that he had formed there, not only of books, manuscripts, and antiquities, but also of pictures, chiefly by Bellini and other Venetian masters. On 4 July 1793 he was created an honorary D.C.L. at Oxford. He died at Ridge on 19 March 1799, and by his will directed the whole of his collections to be sold‚Äîthe pictures by private contract; the prints, drawings, busts, coins, medals, bronzes, and antiquities by Christie's; the natural history cabinets by King, and the library by Leigh & Sotheby's. The sale of the library alone occupied twenty-nine days in March and April 1801. A valuable catalogue was compiled by Samuel Paterson (Dibdin, Bibliomania, p. 590). Family About 1760 Strange married Sarah, daughter of Davidge Gould of Sharpham Park, Somerset, and sister of Sir Henry Gould the younger; she died at Venice in April 1783. They seem to have had no children. References ;Attribution * This source footnotes: **Gent. Mag. 1783 i. 540, 1799 i. 348; **Clare College Register; **European Mag. 1799, i. 412; **Nichols's Lit.

Life Born in London to a Dutch father and English mother, Bouyer was educated at Leyden in Holland before being admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1761. Migrating to Jesus College in 1763, he graduated LL.B. in 1769. However, his studies had been interrupted for a time while he acted as a tutor to Robert Bertie, second son of the third Duke of Ancaster, who was at Eton. After graduating he was appointed perpetual curate of Edenham in Lincolnshire, near the Grimsthorpe Castle seat of the Bertie family, and following his ordination in 1771 he was presented by them to the valuable Lincolnshire livings of Willoughby-cum- Sloothby and Theddlethorpe St Helen, which he held until 1811. In 1785 he was recommended by Queen Charlotte to Shute Barrington, who collated him to the prebend of Preston in Salisbury Cathedral.for the details of the prebendary see When Barrington moved to Durham, Bouyer followed him, eventually obtaining three prebends and the rectory of Howick and the vicarage of North Allerton, with the chapelries of Brompton and Dighton, all in the diocese of Durham. He was collated to the archdeaconry of Northumberland, 9 May 1812, and died at Durham 30 January 1826. He is buried in Durham Cathedral. Bouyer was an energetic reformer. During his time in Lincolnshire he was engaged in a variety of efforts at employing the poor, promoting wool production and the worsted industry, and founding the Lincolnshire Stuff Balls at Alford in 1785. He established a scheme whereby parishes opened spinning schools, in which children were rewarded for learning to knit and to spin; he publicised these in a pamphlet called An account of the origin, proceedings, and intentions of the ... Society for the Promotion of Industry in the Southern District of the Parts of Lindsey in the County of Lincoln. He continued educational reform on Durham, publishing a Comparative View of the two new Systems of Education for the Infant Poor, in a Charge delivered to the Clergy of Durham, 1811. This led to his involvement in the reform of the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge; he failed to persuade them to establish parochial libraries, so he established them at his own expense in every parish in Northumberland. They contained upwards of 30,000 volumes, which cost him about ¬£1,400, although he was supplied with them by the SPCK at 40 per cent under prime cost. These libraries were placed under the care of the parochial ministers, and the books were lent gratis to the parishioners.

She was designed by the British shipbuilder Charles Mitchell and built in Saint Petersburg. The ship spent her entire career with the Baltic Fleet. She ran aground and sank shortly after she entered service in 1865. Smerch was refloated and repaired shortly afterwards. She became a training ship sometime after 1892 and was stricken from the Navy List in 1904. The ship was hulked five years later and renamed Blokshiv No. 2. She was in Finland when that country declared its independence in 1918, but was returned to the Soviets after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed. Blokshiv No. 1, as the ship was now known, was sunk by German artillery fire in 1941. She was salvaged the following year and remained in service until she was stricken in 1959 and subsequently broken up. Design and description The Russian Admiralty Board had previously licensed the design of the from the United States and wished to compare the John Ericsson-designed gun turrets of those ships with the turrets designed by the British inventor Captain Cowper Coles. The board therefore commissioned Mitchell to design a twin-turret monitor based on the and to build it in the shipyard that he had modernized for the board in Saint Petersburg, Russia.McLaughlin, pp. 149‚Äì50 Smerch was long at the waterline. She had a beam of and a maximum draft of . The ship was designed to displace , but turned out to be overweight and actually displaced . Smerch was fitted with a double bottom that could be flooded in combat to reduce her freeboard. Her crew numbered 11 officers and 122 enlisted men in 1867 and 12 officers and 143 crewmen in 1875.McLaughlin, p. 150 She had a freeboard of only and her deck was often awash in any sort of moderate sea. Smerch rolled heavily and was fitted with three telescoping iron pole masts, probably fore-and-aft rigged, that were used to steady the ship rather than for propulsion.McLaughlin, pp. 154‚Äì55 Propulsion The ship had two simple horizontal direct-acting steam engines, built by Maudslay, Sons and Field of London.Russian Monitors and Coast Defense Ships, p. 305 The engines had a bore of and a stroke of and each drove a single propeller. Steam was provided by three rectangular fire-tube boilers at a pressure of . The engines produced a total of which gave Smerch a maximum speed of about when she ran her sea trials from 12 to 17 June 1865. The ship also had a small donkey boiler for the small steam engine that powered the ventilation fans, the main water pump and rotated the aft turret. Another such engine probably rotated the forward turret. She carried of coal which gave her a range of .McLaughlin, pp. 150, 154 Armament Smerch was initially armed with four 60-pounder smoothbore muzzle-loading guns, a pair in each turret. Various deckhouses and ventilation hatches prevented the turrets from firing directly forward or aft, so each turret could bear approximately 145¬∞ to each side, although this changed slightly over time as changes were made to the ship. In 1867 these were replaced by two Krupp rifled breech-loading guns. Only one gun could fit in the turrets so the old gun ports were plated over and new ones cut in each turret. Three years later, the Krupp guns were replaced by Obukhov rifled guns. They were replaced in their turn in 1876 by two longer, more powerful 9-inch Obukhov guns. The ship carried 120 rounds for each gun. A furnace for the molten iron required by Martin's incendiary shells was fitted between the turrets. Light guns for use against torpedo boats are not known to have been fitted aboard the ship before the 1870s when Smerch received four 4-pounder guns, one Engstr√∂m quick-firing (QF) gun, and a Gatling gun. At some point the ship received four QF Hotchkiss revolving cannon. They were mounted on the turret tops and probably replaced the older 4-pounders.McLaughlin, p. 153 Armor Smerch had a complete waterline belt of wrought iron that was thick amidships and thinned to at the ends of the ship. It was high and completely covered the hull to below the waterline. The armor was backed by 8 inches of teak.McLaughlin, pp. 153‚Äì54 The circular turrets were protected by armor 4.5 inches thick and the area around the gun ports was reinforced by plates to give a total thickness of . The walls of the ship's oval conning tower were also 4.5 inches thick. Her deck was thick.Watts, p. 106Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 175 Construction and service Smerch (Waterspout)Silverstone, p. 385 was ordered on 25 June 1863 and construction began on 13 August at the Admiralty Shipyard, Saint Petersburg, although the formal keel-laying was not until 1 December. She was launched on 23 June 1864 and completed in 1865 at the cost of 554,100 rubles. The ship spent her career with the Baltic Fleet. Smerch struck an uncharted rock off the Finnish coast on 4 August in shallow water and sank. Using pontoons, she was refloated on 1 September and repaired. Little is known of her service other than she was extensively refitted in 1882 and 1889 which included replacement of much of the plating of her hull bottom. The ship was reclassified as a coast-defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and subsequently became a training ship.McLaughlin, pp. 152, 162 The ship was stricken from the Navy List on 20 February 1904 and turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal. Smerch was renamed Blokshiv (Hulk) No. 2 on 27 October 1909 and converted into a mine storage hulk. She was abandoned in April 1918 as the Soviets abandoned Finland, but was returned to them the following month according to the terms of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. The hulk was renamed Blokshiv No. 3 in 1923 and later as Blokshiv No. 1 on 1 January 1932. She was sunk by German artillery on 7 October 1941 in Kronstadt harbor and was stricken on 6 March 1942. The hulk was salvaged in mid-1942 and reentered service on 8 December. She was renamed BSh-1 on 16 May 1949, stricken for the last time on 2 April 1959, and subsequently scrapped.McLaughlin, p. 162 Notes Footnotes References   * Category:Ships of the Imperial Russian Navy Category:Naval ships of Russia Category:Ironclad warships of the Imperial Russian Navy Category:1864 ships Category:Ships built at Admiralty Shipyard Category:Maritime incidents in August 1865 Category:Maritime incidents in October 1941 ","title":"Russian monitor Smerch"},{"id":"29873572","text":"Pseudothelphusa is a genus of crabs in the family Pseudothelphusidae, containing the following species: *Pseudothelphusa americana Saussure, 1857 *Pseudothelphusa ayutlaensis Alvarez & Villalobos, 1997 *Pseudothelphusa belliana Rathbun, 1898 *Pseudothelphusa dilatata Rathbun, 1898 *Pseudothelphusa doenitzi Bott, 1968 *Pseudothelphusa galloi Alvarez & Villalobos, 1990 *Pseudothelphusa granatensis Rodr√≠guez & Smalley, 1969 *Pseudothelphusa hoffmannae Alvarez & Villalobos, 1996 *Pseudothelphusa jouyi Rathbun, 1893 *Pseudothelphusa leiophrys Rodr√≠guez & Smalley, 1969 *Pseudothelphusa lophophallus Rodr√≠guez & Smalley, 1969 *Pseudothelphusa mexicana Alvarez-Noguera, 1987 *Pseudothelphusa montana Rathbun, 1898 *Pseudothelphusa nayaritae Alvarez & Villalobos, 1994 *Pseudothelphusa parabelliana Alvarez, 1989 *Pseudothelphusa peyotensis Rodr√≠guez & Smalley, 1969 *Pseudothelphusa punctarenas Hobbs, 1991 *Pseudothelphusa rechingeri Pretzmann, 1965 *Pseudothelphusa seiferti Hobbs, 1980 *Pseudothelphusa sonorae Rodr√≠guez & Smalley, 1969 *Pseudothelphusa terrestris Rathbun, 1893 References Category:Pseudothelphusidae ","title":"Pseudothelphusa"},{"id":"29873578","text":"Tabanƒ±yassƒ± (\\"flat-footed\\") Mehmed Pasha (Born 1589- died 2 February 1637) was an Ottoman statesman of Albanian descent.

On 25 December 1613, much to the horror of his family, he openly converted to Catholicism and entered in the service of the army of Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy. After the death of his elder brother, John Ernest in September 1617, he claimed his rights, but his father chose a Protestant successor. When his father died in 1623, John VIII occupied Nassau-Siegen at the head of a Habsburg Army and started the Contra-Reformation. In 1624 he became a Knight in the Order of the Golden Fleece. The Surrender of Breda by Vel√°zquez In 1625 he participated in the Siege of Breda. Breda was defended by his second cousin Justinus van Nassau and held out for eleven months before surrendering. John VIII of Nassau-Siegen is depicted in the famous painting The Surrender of Breda by Diego Vel√°zquez, third from the left in the Spanish camp, looking directly at the spectator. In 1630 he was captured by the Dutch Army, however, he was released later that year. In 1631, he was in charge of the Spanish-Flemish Fleet defeated by the Dutch and Scots and English mercenaries, at the Battle of the Slaak, fighting on behalf of the Spanish Governor Francisco de Moncada, 3rd Marquis of Aitona, (1586‚Äì1635). In 1632, Nassau-Siegen was conquered by the Swedes, after which his half-brother John Maurice of Nassau-Siegen re-introduced Protestantism. John VIII died in 1638 and was succeeded by his only son Johan Frans Desideratus, who had to cede part of Nassau-Siegen to the Protestant branch of the family. Marriage and children  His wife, Ernestine Yolande de Ligne John was married in Brussels on 13 August 1618 to the Catholic princess Ernestine Yolande de Ligne d'Amblise (1594‚Äì1668), daughter of Lamoral de Ligne, Prince d'Espinoy. They had six children together: * Maria (1619‚Äì1620) * stillborn daughter (1620) * Clara Maria (1621‚Äì1695), married with her cousins Prince Albert Henri de Ligne in 1634, and with Claude Lamoral, 3rd Prince of Ligne in 1642 * Ernestine Charlotte (1623‚Äì1668), married in 1650 with Maurice Henry, Prince of Nassau-Hadamar * Lamberta Alberta Gabrielle Ursula (1625‚Äì1635) * John Francis Desideratus (Nozeroy, 1627 ‚Äì Roermond, 1699), Count of Nassau-Siegen  Ancestors   External links  *Tercios.org Category:1583 births Category:1638 deaths Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism Category:Counts of Nassau Nassau-Siegen, John VIII of Category:House of Nassau-Siegen Category:People from Dillenburg Category:Generals of the Holy Roman Empire ","title":"John VIII, Count of Nassau-Siegen"},{"id":"29873668","text":"Fall Creek Academy was a free public charter school for grades 6-12 in Indianapolis, Indiana.

It was originally built by the Ottoman Empire and occupied by the French during Napoleon Bonaparte's campaign in Egypt and Syria between 1798 and 1801. The fort became famous as the place where the Rosetta Stone was found in 1799. Description and history The fort is a low, squat rectangular structure with a central blockhouse that overlooks the final few kilometres of the Nile before it joins the Mediterranean Sea. It was built around 1470 by the Mamluk Sultan Qait Bey, who also built the eponymous Citadel of Qaitbay in Alexandria. In 1516, Sultan Qansuh al-Ghuri reinforced it with a defensive wall. The fort subsequently fell into disrepair. The fort was built in part from stone looted from nearby ancient Egyptian sites; when Vivant Denon visited it in 1799, he noted that it was \\"constructed of parts of old buildings; and that several of the stones of the embrasures were of the fine free-stone of Upper Egypt, and still covered with hieroglyphics.\\" Discovery of the Rosetta Stone The French took possession of the dilapidated fort on 19 July 1799, only a few days before the Battle of Abukir, and embarked on a hasty rebuilding. It was subsequently reconstructed in a more thoroughgoing fashion and was renamed Fort Julien after Thomas Prosper Jullien. One of Napoleon's aides-de-camp, Lieutenant Pierre-Fran√ßois Bouchard, uncovered the famous Rosetta Stone at the fort while repairing its defences.Courrier de l'√âgypte no. 37 (2 Fructidor year 7 / 1799) p. 3 Qait Bey's engineers had apparently brought it to the site from elsewhere, possibly a temple at nearby Sais, to use as fill.Saunders, Nicholas J. Alexander's Tomb: The Two Thousand Year Obsession to Find the Lost Conqueror, p. 134. Basic Books, 2007. Two years later, the fort was captured by a combined British and Turkish force after a short siege and bombardment. Current condition The fort was extensively restored by the Egyptian government in the 1980s and reopened in 1985 by President Hosni Mubarak. It is now surrounded on three sides by the village of Izbat Burj Rashid and is open to the public. It is possible to reach it by taxi from Rashid.

Set in 1918, the book explores the world of physics in the early 20th century‚Äîincluding the advent of modern physics and the role of physicists in World War I‚Äîthrough the recollections of the fictional Viktor Jakob. Jakob is an old German physicist who spent most of his career during the period of classical physics, a paradigm being confronted by the rapid and radical developments of relativistic physics in 1900s and 1910s. This conflict allows for extensive examination of the various tensions placed on Jakob by the academic environment, the German academic system, and the changing academic culture of the early 20th century. The character of Jakob, a professor at a minor German university, is an amalgam of German physicists based on archival research by McCormmach. In the novel, he recalls interactions and events, documented in extensive footnotes to genuine publications and archival sources, involving many of the well-known physicists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Night Thoughts, pointedly criticized for its lack of literary merit by some reviewers, was generally praised for its attempt at forging a new approach to history and historical fiction by incorporating extensive research into the text. Style The novel is written as a traditional fictional biography. However, it uses footnotes to provide examples of historical proof for events and situations in Jakob's life as a way to prove the feasibility of situations. Also, alongside the historical footnotes which point to the lives of historical scientists, his study is decorated with photographs of the same scientists, creating a reflection of how he has been shaped by their precedence. Historical reflections, and flashbacks ‚Äì focusing mostly on the Franco-Prussian war and World War I ‚Äì form a considerable part of the narrative. George Steiner called McCormmach \\"no novelist\\" pointing to how he \\"wisely ... avoids dialogue,\\" commits numerous gaucheries, and how many of the dream sequences are flat. He felt that the work fails to show the passion which scientists feel for science. On the other hand, Mary Jo Nye wrote that McCormach's work \\"might have pleased Polanyi\\", who \\"wanted to see passion, not only reason, in the depiction of the scientist‚Äôs life\\". Plot summary Victor Jakob, a Physics professor in a small German university, reflects on his life as a physicist, recalling major discoveries and ideas of recent decades and his interactions with prominent physicists whose ideas challenge the classical physics worldview. Meanwhile, the tide of World War I is turning against Germany, as the Allies mount The Second Battle of the Somme, pushing the German Second Army back over a 34 mi (55 km) front. As he meditates on the changing world, Jakob hikes to a mountain overlooking his university, where he becomes trapped in a muddy ditch, while gunfire rings out below. In an apparently hopeless situation, he takes out his revolver and \\"open[s] his mouth.\\" (Some reviewers characterize his apparent death as an accident, while others interpret it as suicide, a parallel to that of Ludwig Boltzmann; John Maddox considered it open to interpretation whether Jakob succeeds in killing himself.) Themes A major theme of Night Thoughts is the reinforcement of Thomas Kuhn's conception of history of science as a convoluted mesh of non-linear progress effected by the biography of the scientists. Jakob's research becomes the central means by which the author expresses Kuhn's theory, reinforcing each situation with footnotes which point to events in Jakob's life that mirror historical events. Jakob does not progress linearly in constructing his scientific theories, instead he must handle \\"intellectual upheaval\\" caused by factions in the study of physics, competition for recognition in the hierarchical German University system, tension caused by his students and his own feelings of incompetency. (Kuhn reviewed the manuscript before publication.) The conflict between classical physics and relativistic physics is reflective of more than just the non-linear approach to science; it represents a larger conflict between the \\"klassiche Bildung\\", or a concept of education imbued from the greats of the past, and the newer forms of learning which were breaking away from this reliance on old knowledge. Jakob's reflections are similar to the reflections found in commentary on other aspects of society, including art and literature, comparing them to classical and romantic approaches to physics. A more traditional theme, indicated by the novel's title, is the crumbling world of an old man as he nears death and meditates on his life. The world of Physics that Jakob has known for most of his career is being overthrown by new theories and discoveries of younger scientists, while at the same time his country is nearing defeat in World War I. Jakob struggles with his own relative meager place in the German academic system, as professor at a minor university who is increasingly out of place in the world of modern physics. Jakob's desperation leads him to thoughts of suicide again and again. Research The character of Viktor Jakob was based on extensive archival research and studies of personnel files of many German physicists who were contemporaries of the fictional professor, who (apparently) dies at the novel's conclusion at the age of 69, in 1918. McCormmach's research was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation. Victor Weisskopf points out that there are several \\"strange omissions\\" from the historical context of the novel including Rutherford's discovery of the planetary atom and radioactivity which was the work of Rutherford, Kazimierz Fajans and Frederick Soddy. Reception Due in part to its hybrid nature as both a novel and a work of historical scholarship, Night Thoughts was widely reviewed soon after publication from an unusually wide variety of perspectives. Literary critics, historians of science, and physicists took an interest in the book, and described its genre in a number of ways: from novel to historical novel to an \\"intellectual-historical novel\\" to \\"a new art form: the scientific historical novel\\". The novelty of the book was widely noted, with many reviewers calling it an experiment‚Äîin literary genre, or in historiographical technique. While generally praised as a work of history of science, the book received mixed reviews as a novel, with the emphasis on science and historical detail a detraction from a successful narrative. In a review of the book's varied reception and interpretation, Lewis A. Lawson concluded that \\"the book is a bad novel. Yet it would be a valuable addition to college courses ... most valuable in one of the new interdisciplinary courses that transcend specific disciplines in order to distinguish several different approaches to the acquisition of knowledge and to the validation of experience\\". George Steiner responded similarly, saying that while the novel was poor and the writing \\"no literary masterpiece\\", \\"they nevertheless constitute a very remarkable imaginative deed\\" for \\"bridging the gap between the ideals of literature and ... history of science\\". Philip Mirowski of Tufts University said that he \\"would recommend this volume to any and all historians of economic thought who are dissatisfied with the self-satisfied air and narrow theoretical scope of existing texts.\\" Similarly, Laurie Brown, a physicist at Northwestern University, noting that \\"the idea of this book as a possible new genre in science history is so appealing that I should like to recommend it to a large audience.\\" However, he also pointed out that it may not be very appealing as a novel because Jakob is not a \\"fully developed character in the social world.\\" Caitlin McKenna said McCormmach was wrong in referring to Jakob as an underdeveloped character; she praised Jakob and the novel extremely: \\"What emerges is a whole and wholly believable character who single-handedly embodies the bafflement of the Western mind at the dawn of modernity. At once writer and scientist, McCormmach has called on both these roles to create a novel of imagination and intellect.\\" Legacy In 1995, Steven Weinberg presented a lecture, Night Thoughts of a Quantum Physicist, to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences which expounded his view on the manner by which a new \\"standard model\\" for physics requires a change, similar to the paradigm shift which Jakob saw in the change from classical physics to quantum mechanics.

It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1984. History City directories attribute this house to Anthony Burdick who had it built in 1880. with Burdick settled in Davenport in 1869 and was engaged in several commercial and financial ventures. Notable among these activities was president of First National Bank for 25 years and his ownership of a wholesale jobbing firm, Smith Brothers & Burdick. He was also the president of a local financial firm called the Davenport Clearinghouse Association. The attribution of this house to Burdick is not absolute. Oszuscik in 1979 referred to it as the Shields House and dates it to 1870. Given that there are similarities between this house and the F.H. Miller House (1871) on Brady Street puts that within the realm of possibility. Willet Carroll, however, designed both of these houses so their similarities may be attributed to only that. Carroll was one of the first professional architects working in Davenport. Architecture The Anthony Burdick House combines the rectilinearity of the Italianate style and the mansard roof of the Second Empire style. A noteworthy feature is the entrance bay, which is recessed rather than flush or projecting from the main fa√ßade. It also features numerous window sizes and shapes. The two-story house follows a rectangular plan and there is a gabled-roofed wing off of the back. There is a modillion cornice at the roof deck and a bracketed and molded frieze. Keystones decorate the tops of the windows and there is brick quoining on the corners. There have been several alterations made to this house. The central tower has been removed and an addition was added to the south side of the structure. The original dormers have been replaced as have the polychrome shingles.

It was frequented by many celebrities, especially actors and authors. It was established and owned by, and named after, Elaine Kaufman, who was indelibly associated with the restaurant; Elaine's shut down several months after Kaufman died. Elaine's was located on the Upper East Side, near the corner of 2nd Avenue and East 88th Street in Manhattan. History Established in 1963, Elaine's is famed both for the writers and other prominent New Yorkers such as Nelson W. Aldrich Jr., Woody Allen, Noel Behn, Candace Bushnell, William J. Bratton, Paul Desmond, Jared Faber, Mia Farrow, Clay Felker, Helen Frankenthaler, Joseph Heller, Peter Maas, Norman Mailer, Robert Motherwell, Chris Noth, George Plimpton, Mario Puzo, Sally Quinn, Daniel Simone, Mark Simone, Gay Talese, Tom Wolfe and Sidney Zion, who had been regulars over the years, and for its late chain-smoking namesake and proprietress Elaine Kaufman, who ran the restaurant for over four decades. Other visitors to the establishment included Leonard Bernstein, Michael Caine, Kirk Douglas, Clint Eastwood, Mick Jagger, Willie Nelson, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, New Jersey attorney Arthur Maurello (who later relocated to South Dakota) and his wife Irene, Luciano Pavarotti, Eli Wallach and Elaine Stritch, who served as bartender in 1964. The restaurant was noted for its Oscar night, where celebrities and visiting Hollywood stars congregated to watch the Academy Awards ceremony. Kaufman was known for not mincing her words, for booting less-favored customers to seat new arrivals and for forbidding hamburgers to be served in her restaurant. She was once arrested after a physical altercation with a visiting Texan. Elaine also once had a fist fight with the actress Tara Tyson and then claimed that the thespian had set her ablaze with a lit cigarette. She also once chased away the notorious paparazzo Ron Galella by hurling two garbage can lids at him and exclaiming, \\"Beat it, creep... you're bothering my customers\\". In culture Billy Joel immortalized the establishment in his song \\"Big Shot\\" (1978), supposedly about a date gone wrong which included a stop at the eatery, with the lyrics, \\"They were all impressed with your Halston dress and the people that you knew at Elaine's\\". The opening dinner scene from Woody Allen's Manhattan (1979) was filmed at the restaurant, as was a scene from his later work Celebrity (1998). There is a short sequence in the film Morning Glory (2010) of Elaine Kaufman herself at the bar of Elaine's (where the producer played by Rachel McAdams is trying to track down the television host played by Harrison Ford, and Elaine relates at what time he left). In the hit comedy Big Business (1988), to divert a mismatched set of twins (played by Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin) from upsetting an important shareholder vote, Midler's alter-ego character offers to take them to Elaine's. In the 2008 American television miniseries The Looming Tower, the main character John O'Neill, played by Jeff Daniels, is frequently seen at Elaine's. The character of Elaine is played by actress Barbara Rosenblat in episodes 1 and 6. On May 10, 2014, The Moth Radio Hour featured old pre-recorded monologues about experiences they'd had at Elaine's by George Plimpton (featuring his introducing Jerry Spinelli to writers, editors, and director Woody Allen at Elaine's, two months before Houghton Mifflin published Spinelli's first book) and Plimpton's friend Jos√© Torres (who recounted an anecdote he'd shared at Elaine's, about conquering his fear the first time he faced a white man in the boxing ring). In his autobiography Party of One: A Memoir in 21 Songs, television personality and former MTV video jockey (VJ) Dave Holmes stated that he lived in an apartment above Elaine's when he moved to New York City in 1994. Until its closing, Elaine's was a frequent dinner spot in the Stuart Woods's novel series featuring Stone Barrington, wherein during that time the author always began the first paragraph with \\"Elaine's. Late\\". See, for example, The late bar and restaurant is the subject of A.E. Hotchner's 2013 volume \\"Everybody's Coming to Elaines: Forty Years of Movie Stars, All-Stars, Literary Lions, Financial Scions, Top Cops, Politicians, and Power Brokers at the Legendary Hot Spot\\".https://books.google.com/books/about/Everyone_Comes_to_Elaine_s.html?id=xrD1xN9aiosC Elaine's was a favorite meeting and dining spot for Stone Barrington and Dino Bacchetti in the Stone Barrington series written by Stuart Woods. Smoking ban In 2003, New York City banned smoking in restaurants. Kaufman claimed to have quit smoking several years earlier but was unhappy about her customers' being forced to forgo tobacco at their seats. Closing Elaine Kaufman died from Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary hypertension on December 3, 2010, aged 81. Kaufman willed the establishment to longtime manager Diane Becker. Becker shut down the restaurant soon thereafter; it closed on May 26, 2011. Becker later explained her reason for closing the restaurant: \\"The truth is, there is no Elaine‚Äôs without Elaine...the business is just not there without Elaine.\\" Legacy In late 2013, The Writing Room (now closed), owned by Michael and Susy Glick, proprietors of the nearby bo√Æte, Parlor Steak & Fish (now closed) and BB&R; (Blonde, Brunette and a Redhead - also closed), opened its doors in Elaine's old space, featuring the prior restaurant's original famed canopy.

Its fossils (25 specimens) were discovered in Otter Sandstone Formation (late Anisian age) and were first assigned to Rhynchosaurus spenceri. This species was reassigned to its own genus, Fodonyx (the type and only species is Fodonyx spenceri) the holotype of which is EXEMS 60/1985/292 , that described by David W. E. Hone and Michael J. Benton in 2008. More recently, one skull was reassigned to the new genus Bentonyx. It is distinguished from other rhynchosaurs by a single autapomorphy, the ventral angling of the paraoccipital processes. In all other rhynchosaurs these processes angle dorsally or are horizontal. It is not known if this conferred any advantage to Fodonyx. Fodonyx was between 40 and 50 cm long.  Features   Skull and lower jaw  The two premaxillae are very long and run up over the snout to meet the prefrontals at the orbit. At the anterior tip they are narrow and triangular in cross-section. They form the classic rhynchosaurian beak, and there is evidence on the fossil showing that it was probably covered by a keratinous sheath. The maxilla carries a massive tooth plate and has numerous foramina for nerves and blood vessels to reach the gums through. Many of the posterior and lateral teeth are unworn from use, unlike the more anterior teeth which have been worn smooth. The nasal bones are large, but no wider than the frontals. They form a pointed posterior tip with a strong zigzag suture. The lacrimal ducts are clearly visible next to the orbit, while the lacrimal bones form much of the interior surface of the orbit. The prefrontal forms a thick eyebrow ridge, possibly as protection from predators. The jugal is complex, with four branches, and forms the anterior and ventral margins of the lower temporal fenestra. The dorsal branch forms a strong pillar behind the orbit, which has a more pronounced crest than other rhynchosaurs. The frontals are very long, and form a dish shape posteriorly. The postfrontal is triangular and forms part of the back of the orbit. The parietals are fused and have a high narrow ridge dorsally, with lateral wings extending across the upper temporal fenestrae. The postorbitals are roughly T-shaped, with three branches. Unlike Late Triassic forms, Fodonyx has a supratemporal bone. The quadratojugal and quadrate are mainly missing. One squamosal is preserved, forming much of the posterior margin of the skull. Much of the palate is intact, although the vomeronasals are quite degraded due to their length and thinness. The palatines form most of the borders of the choana. The pterygoids are very large and have three main processes, all broad and flat. The ectopterygoids are very small and hidden in palatal view. Small fragments of the hyoids are preserved, with a circular cross section and lateral striations. The basioccipital is short and attached to the narrow basisphenoid. The occipital condyle is hemispherical. Much of the detail on the paraoccipital is hard to make out due to difficulties of preparation. Only the anterior portions of the lower jaw are well preserved, but it has the typical rhynchosaur shape, curving up to the anterior tip. Teeth are mainly obscured as the jaws are tightly shut. The splenial is narrow except at the tip where it supports the symphyseal plate.  Spine and vertebrae  Cervical and sacral vertebrae are not known, only dorsal and caudal. The dorsal vertebrae have round centra which narrow noticeably towards the centre of the bone, and are deeply amphicoelous. They lack a keel, but have a deep excavation in the floor of the neural canal. Neural arches are around 15 mm tall, with narrow pillars supporting the zygapophyses, and are attached by broad flat facets. The zygapophyses are almost circular and very flat, which would allow side-to-side movement but little up-and-down movement. Three chevrons are preserved. The dorsal elements have fused to create a triangular opening.  Ribs and gastralia  Many ribs are present, although partially fragmented, and show that the ribs were robust and the ribcage deep. They were also remarkably straight, at least at the anterior. There are also many gastralia, although these are quite jumbled together, and appear to be made of three segments. The gastral basket is almost entirely disarticulated.  Forelimbs and pectoral girdle  The scapulae have broad blades, and prominent bosses where the clavicles may have attached. Much of the front limbs are missing, but the humeri were broad and not very long, with an oval cross-section.  Hindlimbs and pelvic girdle  The pelvis is incomplete, with the ilium clearly showing growth lines. The ischium has a thick round dorsal margin and a curved blade. The femur is missing, but the remainder of the hindlimb is present. The tibia is fairly long but quite thin, with a compressed oval cross-section. It shows heavy wear, and has a distinct twist where it probably attached to the fibula. This is more slender than the tibia, but still relatively robust. All the proximal tarsals and three of the distal tarsals are present, but are worn and broken. In general, they are quite rounded. The first metatarsal is short and broad but the other four are long and flat, although they are broken so it is hard to say exactly how long. The toes have, respectively, 2,3,4,5 and 4 phalanges. These all narrow as they head towards the claws. The unguals are all very large and broad, and have rounded ends without a recurve. Each ungual bears a shallow groove along the sides, probably for locking the keratin sheath.  Taxonomy  Cladogram based on Ezcurra et al.

Journalism Steell seems to have begun his literary career in New York as a journalist on the New York Tribune from 1887 to 1888, and soon became the New York correspondent for the Albany Press, St. Paul Dispatch, Chicago Times, and Nashville American, and soon was head of a syndicate of Southern papers. In the 1920s he was the Paris correspondent of the New York Herald at which time he interviewed Gertrude Stein in 1924 after she published her long gestated novel The Making of Americans. The reason he moved to Paris was to be near his daughter Susan Steell (born 1906), who had won the first scholarship for American girls to study singing in Paris with the French mezzo-soprano Blanche Marchesi that had been established in 1923 by the opera singer Marie Jeritza. Her father commissioned a portrait of her about 1923 from the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo M√ºller-Ury, which was exhibited in 1925 and of which American Art News, April 11, 1925, said that it ‚Äò...shows Mr. Ury at his most discerning.‚Äô Susan (often later called Suzanne) was to enter Broadway, and became one of the close friends of Katharine Hepburn at the time of her first Hollywood success. Susan died in 1959 at 53. First Published Novel His first novel was the well-received Isidra: The Patriot Daughter of Mexico ‚Äì a Mexican story of the French intervention (1888) which was compared with some of the work of Bret Harte (1836‚Äì1902). Literary career By 1898, he had written, amongst a mass of journalism by this time, a number of fictional and dramatic works: The Morning after the Play: A Comedy in One Act (1889), Mortal Lips (1890) a story of contemporary life in Harlem,American Annual Cyclopaedia and Register of Important Events, Vol.15 (1891) Appleton and Co., New York In Seville, & Three Toledo Days ‚Äì a series of Spanish sketches (1894), and The Fifth Commandment A Play in One Act (1898). He had also written poetry, and a long poem about Christopher Columbus called The Death of The Discoverer appeared in book form in Philadelphia in 1892. In 1909 he published Walt Whitman‚Äôs Early Life on Long Island. In March and April 1914 he held a series of ‚ÄòConferences‚Äô at the Waldorf Hotel in New York on Prosper M√©rim√©e, Guy de Maupassant, and Maurice Maeterlinck. In 1924 Steell translated J√©r√¥me Tharaud and Jean Tharaud's Long Walk of Samba Diouf, an important piece of literature on negro culture, and in 1928 published a biography Benjamin Franklin of Paris 1776-1785. Dramatist Typical of Steell's work was his liking for one-act dramas, a good example of which was A Juliet of the People produced at the Madison Square Theatre 1901, and which reviewed in the New York Times, 20 January 1900: > \\"A Juliet of the People, a one-act drama by Willis Steell, setting forth in > simple and natural action and with a touch of poetical feeling, the > incidents of a tragedy in humble life, much in the manner of the stories of > the operas of the latest Italian school, had a trial performance last week > at an exhibition matin√©e of a school of acting.

The residence was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. It was included as a contributing property in the Riverview Terrace Historic District in 1983. with History The house was constructed for J.M.D. Burrows. He was an early settler to Davenport having arrived in the town c. 1838. In 1844 he established a wholesale company, Burrows and Prettyman. They did business along the Upper Mississippi River and west to the Missouri River in Iowa and Nebraska. They also made significant profits from their contracts with the U.S. Government supplying Fort Snelling and Fort Crawford along the Mississippi. with He lost his firm in the Financial Panic of 1857. Burrows mortgaged the house to Antoine LeClaire to pay off his debts. He was never able to regain the title to the house and it eventually went to the descendants of George Davenport. Both Davenport and LeClaire founded the city of Davenport and developed it in its earliest decades. In 1905 the house was sold to John Winters, who converted it into apartments. Architecture The portico on the south side of the house. The house is typical of the Italianate style in Davenport in that it also included elements of the Greek Revival style found especially at the main entrance. It is a two-story, nearly square Italianate palazzo. It features a large square cupola on the center of the hipped roof. The cupola has five narrow, round- arch windows on each side. The two show fronts are five bays wide. The garden front on the south has a pedimented tetrastyle portico. The wall brackets on the cornice continue onto the portico. The columns that hold up the portico follow the Renaissance Ionic order after Vincenzo Scamozzi. The columns rest on paneled pedestals. Between them is a cast concrete balustrade that was extended in the early 20th-century in a semi-circular fashion beyond the portico. The north front of the house has a one-story porch that covers the middle three bays. At one time it stretched the entire length of the house. When the house was built there were single-story, two-bay wings on the east and west sides. They stopped short of the main wall on the south front and ended in short recessed porches. Sometime after 1905, the porches were eliminated and a second floor was added to both wings when the house was converted into apartments.

It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1976, and on the Davenport Register of Historic Properties since 1993. Built as a farmhouse in 1860 the city of Davenport purchased the property and renovated it for a senior center in the mid 1970s. History Miles Augustus Collins was born in Albany, New York on September 1, 1832. When he was four years old his family moved to a farm near Blanford, Massachusetts where he was raised. He remained there until 1854 when he moved to Scott County, Iowa where he joined his father as a carpenter. After a year he started farming and started the first cheese factory in the county. They were also among the first cheesemakers in the state of Iowa. He owned several farms and became quite adept at real estate. He moved to his final farm in 1860. On June 15, 1870, he married Amy Wilson, who was a widow. Together they raised six children. He died in his home on June 5, 1908. The Collins family continued to own the house until 1963 when it was sold to the Davenport Park Board for their use. They had a stipulation that the remaining sisters could live in the house rent free until their deaths. with Beginning in 1977 the Davenport Parks and Recreation Department in a joint venture with the Center for Active Seniors, Inc. (CASI) used the house as a senior center. Over the years it has also housed a senior activity center, a place with recreational programming for special needs people, and as a summer youth activities center. On May 2, 2015 the house opened as the Southeast Iowa Senior Information Hub, a resource center for senior citizens and their families. Information that the center provides includes \\"health care, Social Security, transportation, finances and senior housing that ranges from private to assisted living.\\" They also provide monthly programs centered on the concerns of seniors. The Davenport Parks and Recreation Department, volunteers and in-kind donations from local businesses renovated the house and brought it up to the standards required by the Americans with Disabilities Act. Architecture The house was originally a three-bay, square structure. Several additions were made to the structure over the years. The pantry, kitchen, and dining room were added to the back of the house in 1870. The full porch was added to the front of the house in 1908, and the sleeping porch was added to the west side in 1916. The two-story frame structure is essentially Classical Revival in style. It features Greek Revival derivative window hoods and a latticework belvedere on top of the hipped roof. The house is situated on the edge of Garfield Park along the Duck Creek Parkway. A handicap ramp and a new porch were added to the rear of the house when it was renovated into a senior resource center.

The present-day, quadrangular building has its origins in the 11th century as a medieval castle. After a fire in 1510 it was rebuilt as a schloss and is one of the few in Lower Saxony that was constructed as a timber-framed building. Because it belonged to the House of Welf for 700 years it is also known as the Welf Castle of Herzberg (Welfenschloss Herzberg).  Geography  Herzberg Castle stands on a wooded eminence () immediately above and west of the centre of the town of Herzberg am Harz, which lies on the southwestern edge of the Harz Mountains. A stretch of the River Sieber runs past the castle to the north.  Architecture  The castle seen from Herzberg, day and night Herzberg and its castle in 1753 The present castle is an enclosed four-winged building with a rectangular courtyard (40 x 58 m) and was rebuilt after a serious fire in November 1510. Since the new castle was completed in 1528 its basements have been made of sandstone. One wing has an upper storey of stone, while the upper floors of the other three wings have been constructed using timber-framing. Its access through a gate tower and adjoining barbican has been retained. The old castle and the inner courtyard of the new one are entered after passing through the two-story gatehouse. The castle tower, known as the Clock Tower (Uhrturm), was built in the eastern corner. Its three upper storeys are made of timber.  History  Merian copperplate (section) Originally the schloss was a medieval castle that was based on a hunting lodge built on the spot between 1024 and 1029. The castle was probably built at the behest of King, later Emperor, Lothair III, known as Lothair of S√ºpplingenburg. In 1144, Herzberg Castle was given to the von G√∂ttingen family of ministeriales from Bavaria by the House of Welf, who charged them with maintaining the castle and its surroundings. Previously, Count Hermann of Lutterberge had lived here, but he died in 1143 without any heirs who could inherit the fiefdom. The castle was first recorded in 1143 and, in 1158, it finally became a Welf allodial possession as the result of an exchange of property between Frederick Barbarossa and the Welf, Henry the Lion. Henry the Lion gave up estates inherited through his first wife, Clementia of Z√§hringen in Swabia. Since then the castle has been in Welf hands uninterruptedly for 708 years until the demise of the Kingdom of Hanover in 1866. Empress Maria of Brabant, widow of Emperor Otto IV, made out a deed at the Hertsberg in 1218, thus the castle was an imperial residence for a short while. In 1279 the castle served as the residence for the widow of Duke Albert the Great. From 1337 to 1714 the castle was a ducal residence almost continuously. Lower Saxony steed (above) on the outside of the castle gateway View from the castle interior (gatehouse) into the gate zwinger In 1290 the castle became the residence of the Welf line of Brunswick-Grubenhagen, which was formed around this time. From 1486 the dukes of the Principality of Grubenhagen lived here until they died out in 1596. Thereafter the estate was transferred to the Welf line of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. There was a major fire at the castle in 1510. The lord of the castle, Duke Philip I, his wife, Catharine, and their son, Philip, were rescued at the last minute from the rapidly engulfing flames. The duke's shield bearer and the duchess's chambermaid died in the fire. Duke George of Brunswick and L√ºneburg lived in the castle until 1635 with his wife, the Landgravine Anne Eleanor of Hesse-Darmstadt. In 1629, the first Elector of Hanover was born here, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. In 1714 the schloss was given up as a residence and from 1882 it was the seat of the district court of Herzberg. In 1900 a museum was established in the castle. Although the castle had survived largely undamaged by fire over the centuries, it suffered severe damage at the end of the Second World War, which has since been repaired. On the night of 4 April 1945, there was a mighty explosion at a nearby ammunition dump, where 40,000 kg of explosives and 8,000 mines had been stored. This blew the roof off the castle and, in the wake of the explosion, the museum was destroyed and probably looted. In 1947, further damage was caused when some nearby military bunkers were blown up. Today the castle houses a small cultural centre with a restaurant, a museum and the great hall, which is used for various cultural events. The museum portrays the history of the forestry industry in the Harz, the castle's history and that of the Welfs. Other exhibition areas present the history of Herzberg arms manufacture as well as the work of Herzberg organ maker Johann Andreas Engelhardt. In part of the permanent exhibition there is a facsimile of the Gospels of Henry the Lion, a masterpiece of Romanesque book illumination of the 12th century containing the four Gospel accounts.

History  In 1923, the United States Congress funded a sequential lighted airway along the transcontinental airmail route. The lighted airway was proposed by National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), and deployed by the Department of Commerce. It was managed by the Bureau of Standards Aeronautical Branch. The first segment built was between Chicago and Cheyenne, Wyoming. It was situated in the middle of the airmail route to enable aircraft to depart from either coast in the daytime, and reach the lighted airway by nightfall. Lighted emergency airfields were also funded along the route every 15‚Äì20 miles. Construction pace was fast, and pilots wishing to become airmail pilots were first exposed to the harsh wintertime work with the crews building the first segments of the lighting system. By the end of the year, the public anticipated anchored lighted airways across the Atlantic, Pacific, and to China. The first nighttime airmail flights started on July 1, 1924. By eliminating the transfer of mail to rail cars at night, the coast to coast delivery time for airmail was reduced by two business days. Eventually, there were 284 beacons in service. With a June 1925 deadline, the 2,665 mile lighted airway was completed from New York to San Francisco. In 1927, the lighted airway was complete between New York City and Salt Lake City, Los Angeles to Las Vegas, Los Angeles to San Francisco, New York to Atlanta, and Chicago to Dallas, 4121 miles in total. In 1933, the Transcontinental Airway System totaled 1500 beacons, and 18000 miles  Technical  These are the remnants of Transcontinental Air Mail Route Beacon 37A, which was located atop a bluff in St. George, Utah, U.S.A. With concrete arrows indicating the direction to the next beacon, a rotating light tower, and a shed that usually held a generator and fuel tanks, these beacons were once situated every 10 miles on air routes across the United States beginning around 1923. The lighted Airway Beacons were a substantial navigation aid in an era prior to the development of radio navigation. Their effectiveness was limited by visibility and weather conditions. Beacon 61B on a modern display tower, originally installed on route CAM-8 near Castle Rock, WA diameter rotating beacons were mounted on high towers, and spaced ten miles apart. The spacing was closer in the mountains, and farther apart in the plains. The beacons were five million candlepower, and rotated six times a minute. \\"Ford beacons\\" (named after Ford Car headlights) were also used, placing four separate lights at different angles. Airports used green beacons and airways used red beacons. The beacons flashed identification numbers in Morse code. The sequence was \\"WUVHRKDBGM\\", which prompted the mnemonic \\"When Undertaking Very Hard Routes Keep Directions By Good Methods\\".Forden, Lesley. The Ford Air Ttours: 1925-1931. New Brighton Minnesota: Aviation Foundation of America, 2003, First edition 1972. No ISBN. Engineers believed the variations of beacon height along hills and valleys would allow pilots to see beacons both above ground fog, and below cloud layers. Towers were built of numbered angle iron sections with concrete footings. Some facilities used concrete arrows pointing in the direction of towers. In areas where no connection to a power grid was available, a generator was housed in a small building. Some buildings also served as weather stations. Many arrow markings were removed during World War II, to prevent aiding enemy bombers in navigation, while 19 updated beacons still remain in service in Montana.

They were written down as a collection, in the eleventh century, on some pages (pages 43 verso to 45 verso, between a hymnal and a collection of canticles) of a manuscript that were originally left blank. The manuscript is currently in the collection of Durham Cathedral, to which it was donated in the eighteenth century. The Proverbs form the first part of the manuscript. The second part, to which it is bound, is a copy of √Ülfric's Grammar (minus its glossary). Each proverb is written in both Latin and Old English, with the former preceding the latter. Olof Arngart's opinion is that the Proverbs were originally in Old English and translated to Latin, but this has since been disputed in a conference paper by T. A. Shippey . Origin While Richard Marsden's introduction in The Cambridge Old English Reader discusses the essentials of the Durham Proverbs, there is still more to be learned. The Durham Proverbs are held in a manuscript that is kept in the library of Durham Cathedral, which is why they are named the \\"Durham\\" Proverbs. The original home of the manuscript is thought most likely to have been in Canterbury. The original manuscript of the Durham Proverbs contains copies of √Ülfric's own work. Several of the proverbs also appear in later works of the thirteenth- century. Considering the repetition of their use, during later times and in future works, stresses their importance from the eleventh-century society. For every one of the Durham Proverbs, there is a Latin version. The commonalities between the Latin version of the proverbs and the Old English version, in more than one manuscript, suggest that there was a common source from which the Durham Proverbs were created in Old English from Latin. Background and history The Durham Proverbs are considered to have been used to document everyday business of the people of Anglo-Saxon England. The proverbs were used in monastic schools to teach text along with other texts such as the Disticha Catonis (also known as the \\"Dicts of Cato\\") and a Middle English collection titled the Proverbs of Hendyng. Several of the proverbs have parallels within other proverbs listed below, as well as the Old English Disticha Catonis and the Proverbs of Hendyng. Despite their use, the source of these proverbs is largely debated and still considered unknown. Olof Arngart's notes on the Durham Proverbs say that some of the proverbs have a biblical reference. The book of Proverbs in the Bible resembles the Durham Proverbs by providing teachings on morals for a society of its time. The \\"Dicts of Cato\\" were also influenced by the Durham Proverbs, which in turn, influenced Christianity. The first of the Durham Proverbs can even be seen in the Dict of Cato 23. Purpose The Durham Proverbs comprise a mixture of true proverbs and maxims, and are clearer in this regard, according to linguist and Anglo-Saxon anthropologist Nigel Barley , than the collection of Old English poems entitled the Maxims are -- the latter's status being comparatively unclear. According to the Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages a maxim is a short statement that (as Laingui puts it) \\"sets out a general principle\\", that briefly expounds a liturgical, legal, moral, or political rule as a short mnemonic device. The Durham Proverbs are called proverbs because the collection has what Marsden calls \\"transferability\\" to man. The Durham Proverbs are not as serious as some of the Old English maxims and can even be considered humorous in some areas. The proverbs are similar to fables or parables seen in Modern English. Each proverb has a lesson to teach, as do the fables and parables. It is important to note the proverbs' resemblance to Old English poetry. Using alliteration and rhythm, the proverbs show some of the earliest uses of words and phrases, such as \\"cw√¶√æ se (√æe)\\" which translates to \\"quoth he who\\", and is later seen in more Middle English sources. In addition to their importance of gaining knowledge of the Old English history, the proverbs include many words that are not seen anywhere else in Old English writings. Arngart suggests that the study of the proverbs \\"furnishes insights into contemporary folklore and social life\\". The proverbs themselves The proverbs have their roots in gnomic poetry, and show a relationship in some places to the Disticha Catonis and other works of the surviving Anglo-Saxon corpus. The Old English versions are sometimes (but not always) alliterative, or in verse form, and employ the same formulae with \\"sceal\\" and \\"by√æ\\" as other works do. However, they have a distinctive flavour of their own, one outstanding characteristic of which is the humorous expression that they embody (as in number 11, for example) -- a quality that is lacking in the gnomes. A yet more distinctive feature is how often the proverbs echo the verse of other works, such as the echo of The Wanderer in number 23. Below are the first 25 Durham Proverbs: :Ge√æyld by√∞ middes ƒìades. : :Frƒìond dƒìah feor ge nƒìah: by√∞ near nyttra. : :√Üt √æearfe mann sceal freonda cunnian. : :Nafa√∞ «£nigmann frƒìonda t≈ç feala. : :Beforan his frƒìonde bidde√æ, sƒì √æe his w«£del m«£ne√æ. : :G≈çd gƒìr by√æ √æonne se hund √æƒÅm hrefne gyfe√∞. ::\\"It is a good year when the hound gives to the raven.\\" :Oft on s≈çtigum bylige searowa licga√∞. : :Hwƒ´lum √¶fter medo menn m«£st ge√æyrste√∞. : :√Üfter leofan menn langa√∞ swƒ´√∞ost. : :N≈´ hit ys on swƒ´nes d≈çme, cw√¶√∞ se ceorl s√¶t on eoferes hricge. : :Ne swƒÅ √æƒìah trƒìowde √æƒìah √æ≈´ teala ƒìode, cw√¶√æ sƒì √æe geseah h√¶gtessan √¶fter hƒìafde geongan. ::\\"Nonetheless, I would not trust you though you walked well.\\", said he who saw a witch passing along on her head. :Eall on m≈´√∞e √æ√¶t on m≈çde. : :Gem«£ne sceal mƒÅga feoh. : :Man dƒì√æ swƒÅ hƒì by√æ √æonne hƒì m≈çt swƒÅ hƒì wile. : :Ne saga sagan, cw√¶√∞ sƒì gesƒìah hwer fulne hƒìalena sƒìo√æan. : ::Marsden suggests there is a word that has been omitted here, and thus there is an unclear translation that could hold various meanings. When Marsden attempted to compare this to the Latin version, it was quite different. Marsden says, \\"So far, we must accept defeat on this one\\". :Ea√∞e wƒ´s man m√¶g witan spell and ƒìac secgan. : :Blind by√æ bƒÅm ƒìagum, sƒì √æe brƒìostum ne starat. : :√êƒÅ ne saca√∞ √æe √¶tsamne ne bƒìo√∞. : :Ne dƒìah eall s≈ç√æ ƒÅs«£d ne eall sƒÅr √¶twiten. ::It does no good (for) all truth (to be) told nor all wrong imputed. ::For subsequent variations on this same proverb, from Chaucer to Horman's Vulgaria, see . :Gyf √æ≈´ well sprece, wyrc √¶fter swƒÅ. : :Earh m√¶g √æ√¶t an √æ√¶t he him ondr√¶de. ::A coward can do only one thing: fear. ::\\"earh\\" means coward here and is glossed as such in contemporary works (\\"timidorum militum\\" in Aldhelm's De Virginitate being translated as \\"eargra cempana\\"), although the more general meaning of the word in O.E. was \\"sloth\\" or \\"sluggard\\". :Nƒì sceal man t≈ç «£r forht nƒì t≈ç «£r f√¶gen. ::One should be neither too soon fearful nor too soon glad. ::The proverb has echoes of The Wanderer (\\"nƒì t≈ç forht nƒì t≈ç f√¶gen\\", 150). The twain have been variously translated. T. A. Shippey, who writes the O.E. of the Proverbs as \\"«£rforht\\" and \\"«£rf√¶gen\\", explains \\"glad- too-soon\\" as meaning optimistic. The Latin version of the proverb is \\"nec ilico arrigens\\", which translates as \\"nor quick to rouse\\" rather than the \\"glad\\" or \\"happy\\" usually ascribed to the O.E. form. (For further exploration of the Latin by Arngart see .) : :Hwon gelpe√∞ se √æe wide si√æa√∞. ::A little boasts he who travels widely. ::This proverb echoes sentiments expressed in Hrafnkels saga Freysgo√∞a, namely that travel abroad, where one is treated as an adult, spurs young men to self-confidence, thinking themselves \\"greater than chiefs\\" upon their return home.

Care work is a sub-category of work that includes all tasks that directly involve care processes done in service of others. It is often differentiated from other forms of work because it is considered to be intrinsically motivated, meaning that people are motivated to pursue care work for reasons other than financial compensation. Another factor that is often used to differentiate caring labor from other types of work is the motivating factor. This perspective defines care labor as labor undertaken out of affection or a sense of responsibility for other people, with no expectation of immediate pecuniary reward.. Regardless of motivation, care work includes care activities done for pay as well as those done without remuneration. Care work refers to those occupations that provide services that help people develop their capabilities, or the ability to pursue the aspects of their lives that they value. Examples of these occupations include child care, all levels of teaching (from preschool through university professors), and health care of all types (nurses, doctors, physical therapists and psychologists). Care work also includes the array of domestic unpaid work that is often disproportionately performed by women. Care work is frequently focused on the responsibility to provide for dependents, such as children, the sick, and the elderly. However, care work also refers to any work done in the immediate service of others, regardless of the recipient's dependent or nondependent status, and can even extend to \\"animals and things.\\" The study of care work is closely linked with the fields of feminist economics and feminist legal theory, and is associated with scholars including Marilyn Waring, Nancy Folbre, Martha Albertson Fineman, Paula England, Maria Floro, Diane Elson, Caren Grown and Virginia Held. Importance Effective care for the sick allows people to remain productive and continue contributing to society. The products of care work are essential to human well-being. Without genuine care and nurturing, it is thought that children cannot develop into high- functioning individuals, and adults have a hard time maintaining or expanding their well-being and productivity. Actively involved childcare, whether provided in the home, by the public sector or by the private sector, contributes to the development of healthy and productive children. Effective care for the sick allows recipients to remain productive and continue contributing to society. In this sense, care work is directly related to the functioning of a society as well as to the economic development of that society in that well-cared for people can more effectively contribute to the market. Care work is responsible for creating both social capital and human capital. Caring for others is often costly, which is why care work is associated with the ‚Äúcare penalty‚Äù.Friedman, Gerald (2012), Microeconomics: Individual Choice in Communities, Ed. 5.1, Amherst: independently published, pp. 112-115, This penalty is so named because a person's work caring for others is often not compensated by any monetary means. It has been suggested that individuals who don‚Äôt take care of others‚Äîespecially the next generation‚Äîwill not be capable of reproducing themselves. The implication is that the receipt of care is often necessary for individuals to reach the stage of life where they can go on to care for others. This argument suggests that care is necessary for the development of human life and, on a larger scale, for functional societies. The target of teaching individuals to care for others may lead to forms of distributional struggle, particularly along gender lines. A popular belief in economics is that the household sector is a wealth spender rather than a wealth creator, although many argue that the household sector plays a very important role in wealth creation. Unlike the business sector, the wealth created by the household sector is not financial wealth, which is unsurprising in that much of the work done in the household sector is unpaid. The resulting wealth falls into the category of social wealth because the care work that parents perform in raising a child increases that child's ability to perform in society later. As a whole, the individuals who benefit from having received care perform better in academic and social settings, enabling them to create financial wealth later in life and to play a part in increasing social capital. Sabine O‚ÄôHara offers an expanded concept of the role of care in the economy, arguing that not only people, but \\"everything needs care.\\" Foregrounding what is often treated as \\"context\\" and highlighting the sustaining nature of care services offered outwith the formal economy, she sees care as the basis of market economies. Who does care work? Family and community Before the Industrial Revolution, care work (such as taking care of the household and raising children) was done by the entire family, and often involved the contributions of an entire community. In this sense, the core sphere was not seen as separate from daily business interactions, because the idea of the market did not yet exist as it does today. Industrial era With the dawn of the Industrial Era, the core sphere became more separate from jobs and business, which were performed outside and away from the home. Largely as a product of patriarchal societies, men became the ones who left the home to do their work in factories and other non-domestic jobs. Women, who were considered better suited to nurturing, were left at home and expected to provide childcare and do the housework. This familial hierarchy persisted and has continued to show itself in the contemporary American family, with a breadwinner father, a homemaker mother, and their children. As women's duties in the home were not seen as part of any economic market, they were believed to be unimportant and were largely ignored. This issue persists today in the field of economics. Acts performed in the home often carry considerable replacement costs but are not factored into productivity. It is possible to pay others to perform many of the tasks associated with care work, but to do so is often prohibitively expensive. When adding up the potential costs of work such as round-the-clock childcare, housekeeping, cooking, and the cost of a person such as a home health aide to provide care for elderly family members, it proves much more cost effective for families to substitute their time rather than pay the replacement cost. While paid care work is considered employment, work undertaken by family members is not counted as productive towards the economic market and is therefore overlooked when considering things such as employment status. Despite persisting complications regarding the perception of care work, the economic environment has changed from what it was a century ago. Many more women now participate in the labor force at least part-time, and many more believe that the \\"cult of domesticity\\" for women of the 19th and 20th centuries is a thing of the past. However, studies show that women have come to dominate caring professions - such as teaching, childcare, nursing, social work - and that most of these professions are paid considerably less than the occupations more frequently held by men. To add to this, women frequently are still expected to do the housework and to raise the children in many families. The persisting idea that care work is unimportant combined with these factors explains why care work continues to be ignored from an economic point of view, and why women still have a difficult time shirking gender roles. Women and unpaid care work Many studies have shown that women provide the majority of unpaid childcare, while some have shown men to be more likely to support the elderly than to care for children. The comparative willingness of women to perform unpaid care work has historically contributed to the poor compensation received by people in care- based professions. The historical and cultural pressure on women to provide these services without assurance of financial compensation has devalued care work, leading to these professions being heavily underpaid in comparison to professions which require a similar amount of training and work but are not equivalent to any domestically performed tasks. Women also carry a heavier burden of care work in the home in comparison to men. This is largely due to differences in gender socialization as well as historical and cultural traditions. The biological differences explain that women show more affection and love in performing care work when compared with men. As they are growing up, women are taught to be more caring and affectionate in their behavior, compared to their male counterparts.Neal et. al. \\"Gender and Relationship Differences in Caregiving Patterns and Consequences Among Employed Caregivers.\\" The Gerontologist, 1997, pp. 813-814 Historical and cultural traditions explain the widely held ideology of women's role in caring for others. In Nepal women work 21 more hours each week than men, and in India, 12 more hours. In Kenya 8- to 14-year-old girls spend 5 hours more on household chores than boys. In all these cases most of these extra work hours for women are spent on care work. This poses a particular problem for women in that these extra hours of domestic care work translate into a difficult balance for women between market work and domestic work.. Since the division of household labor women have not been given many choices other than care work as patriarchal systems have used their physical force, property rights, and cultural norms to force women to take over specializations that are deemed unfit for men. The historical push of women into care work combined with the contemporary dominance of women in these fields, accounts for the modern conceptions that care work is inherently feminine work. However, care work is not naturally feminized. Instead, care work is only socialized into a feminine sphere, and is also done by males. Despite the social nature of the feminization of care work, it has become so feminized that there is often a stigma against men who engage in care work. This stigma may discourage men from entering care work as well as further propagate the belief that care work is inherently women's work. Furthermore, there are many differences in earning between high school graduates and college graduates. This difference is especially pertinent between male and female individuals searching for a job. If unemployed, the differences between the rates of high school graduates and college graduates may even be similar. However, women tend to find more opportunities in unpaid care work if they are unable to get into the paid work force. If individuals are unable to achieve a degree, they will not meet the threshold of what many jobs require. This inevitability is felt by much of the world population who are unable to attend school due to staying in their household to take care of elderly or sick family members. Recently, individual people are not the only ones who claim to provide care. An increasing number of companies are claiming that they will care for you in order to attract you into purchasing their services. For example, Lufthansa, an airline company, had an advertisement that read, \\"Service as dependable as a shoulder to lean on.\\" The accompanying picture displayed a woman leaning her head on a man's shoulder, with both sound asleep. In this case, the take-away message seems to be that a high degree of care translates into high quality. Another airline company, British Airways, had an ad that displayed the same message. It read, \\"New Club World cradle seat. Lullaby not included.\\" The image accompanying the statement showed a woman caring for a baby in her arms. The baby's head, however, was switched with that of a relaxed and content passenger. These are only a few of the companies that are now promoting themselves as care-oriented in order to gain customers. Division by socio-economic class Most paid care work is performed by members of the working class, predominantly women of the working class. Most of the paid work that members of the working class perform is care work.The Guardian, 26 Mar. 2014, David Graeber, \\"Caring too much. That's the curse of the working classes\\" Baumol Effect Caring for others has sparked a lot of controversy as the market prices of items that are required for care increase and just as many care opportunities continue to be non-paid. The costs are increasing and the relative rise of price for the services is not providing any substitutes; this is known as the Baumol Effect. William Baumol and William Bowen describe the Baumol Effect as when there is a relative rise of price of services without substitutes. For example, the costs of childcare and sending children to college have become notably higher than in recent years. To further the pressure on caregivers, elderly lives are increasing and there are fewer siblings to share elder care responsibilities as there were, for example, during the baby boom. However, one issue to note about this effect is people taking advantage of others due to rising costs of items needed for care. The Nice Person's Dilemma is a risk that opportunists will take when they seize advantage of those who are generous and cooperative. If the Baumol effect occurs, many will take advantage of these ‚ÄúNice Persons‚Äù and act as if they will pay them back, but never do because of the higher prices. This dilemma proves why individuals are unable to make any change in community care. It takes whole communities to commit this change in order for the communities to gain from provided care and make sure that people do not cheat the system through the Nice Person's Dilemma. Care work and the market Care work of a volunteer Today, there are four parts of the economy: Business, Household, Public, and Non-profit. Typically, we only think that the business sector creates any wealth, and that the other three serve the business sector and alongside it. The truth is that all four parts of the economy generate wealth, and that wealth flows over into other sections of the economy as well. Part of the reason that unpaid care work is largely ignored is because of this belief that the household does not form wealth. In reality, the household prepares children for the other parts of the economy, and without that, none of the other sectors would flourish. Historically care work has largely been associated with domestic unpaid work, yet with the growth and changing nature of the market, care work is occurring more frequently in the paid sphere than it has in the past. This shift has dramatic implications on both care work itself and on society as a whole. As care work is increasingly marketized there is a possibility that those that need care‚Äîthe sick, the elderly and children‚Äîwill not be able to afford the care they need. Another concern is that the quality of care may decrease in response to the call for profit-making and efficiency. As a consequence of these and other concerns, this marketization of care work is under much public and academic scrutiny. These discussions focus on an array of issues including explanations for the endemic low-pay of care work, the effects of the market on the quality of care work, and the implications of the market on care workers themselves. Five particularly prominent theories of care work including devaluation theory, public good theory, prisoner of love theory, commoditization of love theory and love and money theory are frameworks by which academics study and explain these phenomena. Each of these theories examines care work in relation to the market.  Devaluation theory  Devaluation theory seeks to explain the low-wages that are typical of care work by focusing on the fact that many care workers are women and that gender-based biases remain in societies. In short, devaluation theory asserts that decision makers under- estimate the contribution of female dominated jobs to organizational goals, including profits, and therefore underpay these workers. The devaluation theory is supported by sociological studies. In 2002, sociologist Paula England conducted a studying that revealed, even after controlling for skill demands, educational requirements, industry, and sex composition, a net penalty of 5%‚Äì10% for working in an occupation involving care was found (one exception was nursing, which did not seem to experience the pay penalty of other care work). Overall, the evidence suggests that care work pays less than would be expected, given its educational and other requirements. However, it is not necessarily clear that this relation is caused by discriminatory factors, although it is a likely explanatory factor. Public good theory Care work has a multitude of indirect social benefits that associate it with a specific type of good known as a public goods; goods that have benefits that are impossible to deny to those who have not paid for them. Education, an example of care work, is a classic example of a public good. Care work is unique in the category of public goods, however, in that receiving care also helps recipients develop skills, values, and habits that benefit themselves and others. In short, care work, by developing peoples internal capacities, imbues them with future abilities to contribute to society in the form of a public good. This theory may explain the low-wages characteristic of care work. The standard economic argument is that public goods will be underprovided by markets because there is no way to capture and turn into profits benefits that come through social interaction. Prisoner of love theory Care work has been defined as work that provides services based on sustained personal interaction, and is motivated (at least in part) by concern about the recipient's welfare. This understanding of care work has distinct effects both on the nature and wages of care work. If care workers are actually motivated by an intrinsic value for the work which they do, then economic theory asserts that they will tolerate lower wages for their work. In this sense, the low- wages of care work may be explained. Further, the connection that these workers feel to their work puts them in a poor bargaining position. For example, nurses may be reluctant to strike because a strike would negatively affect their patients whom they care about. Commoditization of emotion theory Commoditization of emotion theory focuses on the effects of marketized care work on the care workers‚Äô personal experiences and individual well-being. The commoditization of emotion theory asserts that many jobs in the new service economy require workers to act emotions they do not really feel and that this process is harmful to workers. For example, the commoditization of childcare may be overly emotionally exhausting on childcare workers due to the conflict between the natural emotions of this job and these workers‚Äô need for pay. Arlie Russell Hochschild explores this theory in The Managed Heart.  ‚ÄúLove and Money‚Äù theory  The ‚ÄúLove and Money‚Äù theory attempts to reconcile the perceived divide between work done for intrinsic motivation and work done for pay. Theorists assert that because male and female are seen as opposite, and because gender schema organize so much of our thinking, we develop a dualistic view that ‚Äúwomen, love, altruism, and the family are, as a group, radically separate and opposite from men, self- interested rationality, work, and market exchange.‚Äù This belief has led to the idea that care work should not be done for pay because pay will undermine the intrinsic motivations for this work. However, studies have shown that these divides may not be so stark. Instead, it has been found that acknowledging rewards send the message that the recipient is trusted, respected, and appreciated These results suggest that the more that pay is combined with trust and appreciation, the less it drives out genuine intrinsic motivation‚Äîespecially important in care work. As a result, theorists argue that the central problem with care work is under-demand and that care work should be better compensated by the market..  Care work and public policy  The debate surrounding care work has specific policy implications ranging from issues of market structure, work environments, incentive schemes, regulatory requirements, adequate financial support for care. A second major policy area relating to care work involves the question of gender analysis in economic policy. Accounting for unremunerated care For example, The Unremunerated Work Act of 1993 would require the Bureau of Labor Statistics to conduct surveys that would measure unpaid labor and include these measures in the GDP. This bill was supported by many but not all feminist economists. Critics argue that this bill would romanticize care work and propagate gender biases in the field. Other critics argue that care work can be performed more efficiently outside the home. Finally, some critics believe that this would create a move for care givers to value efficiency over affection, quantity and quality. Accounting for time spent in unpaid care is extremely difficult because it is often an emotionally involved activity that isn't always reported as singular activities. This becomes even more difficult because there is a \\"social desirability\\" bias. For example, husbands will often report more time spent devoted to care work than their wives would report for them, and vice versa. People do this because providing care is considered praiseworthy. Thus, it is hard to make a survey that can get accurate results. However, most of the problems can be minimized through the use of a time diary. This method involves respondents describing the activities that they performed during the previous day. The responses are then standardized for analysis purposes. For example, \\"eating sandwich\\" and \\"drinking juice\\" would both be considered as \\"eating.\\" Women in 32 countries provide an estimated annual $1.5 trillion in health care, according to a study published in The Lancet, a leading medical journal. If unpaid care work performed by women were compensated at even just minimum wage around the world, this would boost measured global economic output by $12 trillion, which is 11% of global economic output and is equivalent to the annual economic output of China, according to a study the McKinsey Global Institute.Annie Lowrey, \\"Give People Money, How a Universal Basic Income Would End Poverty, Revolutionize Work, and Remake the World,\\" (New York: Crown, 2018), p. 151 Care work wage parity A second policy relating to care work is the push for higher wages in the sphere of paid care work. Advocates of this policy believe that individuals who respect and fulfill norms of care will be seen as losers in the competitive economic game, if wages are not increased. Due to this stigma, some economists argue that there may be a gradual erosion of the supply of unpaid care services in the system. Therefore, in order to encourage care work, these proponents advocate for higher wages for care work. However, not all feminist economists believe that higher wages would be appropriate for care work. For example, those who ascribe to the commoditization of emotion framework argue that higher wages may push out true caring emotions in care workers. Care work and gender A third policy debate surrounding care work involves the feminization of care work and focuses on an attempt to make care work more gender neutral, or at least, less disproportionately burdensome to women. One model set forth to address these disparities is the ‚Äò‚Äòuniversal-breadwinner model‚Äô‚Äô which aims at achieving equity through women‚Äôs employment and parity with men. The ‚Äò‚Äòcaregiver- parity model‚Äô‚Äô promotes increased support for informal care work and on forms of employment for women, such as part-time employment, that would increase their time available to provide domestic care work. The first model shifts care and reproductive work to the market and the state, whereas the second keeps care work within the household with support from public funds. Yet both models, to an extent, lift the burden of care work off of women and transfer it either toward the state or toward men. Another model is Shared Earning/Shared Parenting Marriage, which involves not transfer payments from taxpayers to women for women to do the care work, but men actually taking responsibility for half the care work themselves, and women taking half the financial responsibility of basic needs of the family. The fact that paternity is now inexpensively provable is used to support recognition of this model. This model is also focused on improving the experience of children and removing developmental distortions from the feminization of care, such as those that arise from symbiotic mothering or paternal neglect trauma.  Care work and gender analysis in economic policy  Care work, in that it is disproportionally done by women and is also often unpaid, highlights the importance of the larger issue of considering gender in economic policy. As a result, many economists argue that gender analysis should be an essential part in the consideration of any economic policy. Care work and economic policy across the world Care work is a universal force, but it is manifested differently across the world due to differences in a number of factors including the availability of domestic service, the extent of the informal economy, and international migration. For this reason, economists argue that there are differences between Northern and Southern countries that would influence the effectiveness of certain policies in the South. Public policies suggested for these regions include increased availability of day care centers, greater access to schools, greater access to health care, improved public transportation, increased access to telephones and more.  The Care Penalty  The Care Penalty is the term for the sacrifices one makes when performing care work. Nancy Folbre describes the term care penalty in depth in her book The Invisible Heart. Care penalties can refer to an array of sacrifices, whether it's a loss of personal time, money, or experiences missed out on while providing care. The care work in question can be provided to children, animals, the elderly, the sick, the mentally challenged, the learning incapable, and others of like disability. Providing care work limits a person's ability to compete with those who don‚Äôt have to provide such care. For example, say a single woman with the responsibility of a child is in the cards for a job promotion, but so is a single, childless woman. There is a high chance the company will take this into account and give the job to the woman who isn‚Äôt tied down to a child, because she likely has far more time to devote to the position. Folbre points out that the concept of the care penalty leads to distributional struggles extremely relevant to gender roles (see 5.3). In situations like the Good Parent's Dilemma, this is made known. When two people choose to have a child, in most cases, one parent is forced to sacrifice far more than the other, so that the other can work and provide for the family. A vast majority of the time, the parent that ends up staying home and caring for the children is the mother. According to the U.S. Census Bureau report of 2012, there were only 189,000 homes run by stay-at-home dads, compared to 5,091,000 homes run by stay-at-home moms, meaning that roughly 4,902,000 more women are paying care penalties than men. When women make this sacrifice, it not only affects them in the moment, but it affects them even after the child is capable of being independent. By taking time off from their careers, these women are at a disadvantage in the work force for years to come. This long term decline in earnings is referred to by Folbre as the ‚ÄúFamily Gap or Motherhood Gap.‚Äù Folbre, Nancy- Valuing Family Work This reduction in compensation is not attributable to working fewer hours. Rather, mothers with families often are passed for advancement opportunities such as the promotion scenario described above. The motherhood penalty has been increasing in part due to increased parity of pay for men and women. In 1991 it was estimated that the ‚Äúmotherhood gap‚Äù accounted for 60% of the difference between men's and women's compensation. Additionally, tends to be more severe for women with higher levels of education. Parenthood is seemingly the type of care work that evokes the most significant, and most common, care penalty. Since the mere cost in dollars of raising a child increases constantly, the sacrifices one has to make to raise children are increasing at the same rate. The amount of money parents give up to their children is only money they are taking away from themselves; this is an extreme care penalty. Separate from the issue of money, children tend to cause parents to make many other sacrifices. Being responsible for a child can dictate a person's decisions on where to live, what to do in their free time, and what jobs to take. There are opportunities that are necessary to turn down when one is held accountable for another person's well being, which is the perfect definition of the care penalty. Although parenthood may be the most common source of the care penalty, elder care also imposes costs upon the caregiver. Unlike parenthood which entails choice to some extent, an individual cannot choose whether to have elderly members of a family such as parents. Caring for elders is not legally required of a son or daughter in the same way that parents are legally bound to care for their children. There is a societal expectation, however, that adult children will provide care for their parents. In addition to societal expectations, research shows that an expectation of inheritance does have an effect on the behavior of adult children.Folbre, Nancy- The Care Penalty The care penalty suffered by caregivers of the elderly can be just as costly as the care penalty endured by parents of young children. The penalties can be both emotional and economic. Research has shown that over 60% of caregivers for the elderly experienced some depression. With regard to economic consequences, Brandeis University research demonstrated that approximately 66% of caregivers lost out on career opportunities such as training in due to care obligations. Similarly to the childcare, the caregivers for the elderly are largely female. The burden of eldercare is expected to increase due to shifting demographics which render the elderly an increasing percentage of the population. The number of persons over the 85 is expected to increase especially and this group often requires high levels of care. The care penalty is commonly a necessary evil. If someone is in need of supervision, there are not many options to give him or her the care they require. If a person didn‚Äôt want to or for some reason could not care for this person on their own, the only other course of action would be to pay someone else to provide them with the care they need. This is sometimes impossible, since professional care can be extremely costly and can seem inefficient. With professional care there also comes moral issues; it's likely that a person wouldn‚Äôt trust a stranger to care for someone they love, and would find more peace of mind in taking on the responsibility themselves. For this reason, some victims of the care penalty have actually chosen the position, though they are aware of the sacrifices that come with it. The Care penalty to some degree is shaped by public policy. In the United States, the Family Medical Leave Act provides that mothers are entitled to 24 weeks of leave and must be permitted to return to their same position. The Family Medical Leave Act, however, only provides for unpaid leave and it does not address long term reduction in earnings or career advancement. Additionally the prevalence of part-time employment often influences the severity of the care penalty. For example, the care penalty is more severe in the United Kingdom since part-time employment is more common.Folbre, N ancy- Valuing Family Work Many benefits arise when parents raise successful children. Not only do the children themselves benefit, but employers benefit from new, productive employees. Also, the elderly benefit from the Social Security taxes paid by the younger generations. Parents benefit because of reciprocity, with the child in the care-giving role and the parents in the care-receiving role. These positive externalities make it hard for those who provide the care services to charge a price that would reflect the true value of their services. Thus, the care penalty exists to this day.  Explanations for the overspecialization of women in care work  Theories of evolutionary biology explain females‚Äô investment in care as rational response to ensure the benefits of their investment (i.e. the maturity of their pregnancy and child). On the other hand, men simply need to diversify their opportunities, by distributing their seed widely enough, to ensure their genes are cared for and carried forth by invested females. Institutional economics responds to this framework by emphasizing how these analyses ignore the power of social institutions that exaggerate biologically explained male power, including brute strength and freedom from childbearing and child rearing activities. The social arrangements perpetuated by these institutions are deemed to be internalized as individual preferences. Preliminary manuscript pdf version. Women's ‚Äúoverspecialization‚Äù in child rearing is understood has an outgrowth of the institution of patriarchy, rather than an absolutely biologically determined phenomenon. Gerda Learner's research on the history of women has identified patriarchy, men's control over women, as a human-devised social institution dating back to the Bronze Age. Learner argues that the ‚Äúproduction of the idea system‚Äù itself, including our recorded history, was constructed within and therefore imbued with the patriarchical system that underemphasizes women's contributions to public society. Learner asserts that this misrepresentation of women in history not only underemphasizes women's role outside of domestic work, but also works to dampen future women's ambitions outside of the home, thereby reinforcing this misrepresentation. Institutionalized male dominance (patriarchy) has not only excluded women from written history, but also worked to limit their political representation, education and property rights. There are distinct examples of United States law and public policies that have reinforced the patriarchical structure. Until the 19th constitutional amendment provided women the right to vote, women's interests were deemed to be represented through men's political participation. Further, women only began to secure property rights on a state by state basis after the civil war and still women continued to lack any legal claim to their husband's income at this time. Institutionalized patriarchy has worked to limit women's agency in the public sector by concentrating political and economic power in men. cite Gary Becker's Rotten Kid Theorem as a disruption to the idea that a woman's interests can be adequately represented by their husband. If individual family members consistently acted in the collective interest of the entire unit, it would be in the interest of individual family members to act in coordination with the family, which is not always the case as demonstrated by children's rebellion. This recognition of what Braunstein & Folbre (2001) term the ‚Äúnon- benevolent patriarch‚Äù debunks the idea that women can be adequately represented by a single head of household and contend that families represent a myriad of interests that are not always manifested in one member's actions. Braunstein & Folbre assert that the hierarchical relationship produced from the patriachical system over allocates care work to women. Understanding that economic resources translate to increased bargaining power, Braunstein & Folbre contend that men (who historically control the resources) encourage women's specialization in care work in order to limit their economic activity, thereby limiting women's bargaining power, in an effort to preserve their own authority. Therefore, the individual controlling the influx of financial resources is seen as more profoundly interested in preserving their control and power, than in preserving the well being of the entire family. In fact, Braunstein & Folbre demonstrate that more egalitarian families, where men and women are holding comparable economic resources, distribute care work more efficiently that patriarchy structures that have asymmetrical concentrations of power. Modern public policy can be interpreted as covertly enforcing patriarchy by discriminating against single parent households and encouraging the patriarchical family structure that relies on a primary income earner and an unpaid care laborer. For example, the welfare law Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 cites among its goals to end pregnancy out of marriage and to promote two parent households. In addition, United States tax law imposes a lower tax rate on families that have earners with a wide income disparity than the rate applied to families with adults earning a similar income.

Federal investigators believe his activities may have been responsible for as much as one third of the world's electronic spam. Background Oleg Nikolaenko, a resident of Vidnoye, Moscow Oblast, Russia, was identified as the \\"King of Spam\\" by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. He is suspected of running the \\"Mega-D\\" botnet to create a \\"zombie network\\" of as many as 500,000 infected computers. Investigators stated that his operation was responsible for producing up to 10 billion unsolicited e-mails per day, accounting for about 32% of all spam. The messages allegedly promoted counterfeit versions of Rolex watches, herbal supplements and prescription drugs such as Viagra. In October 2008, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission moved to freeze the assets of individuals involved with the Mega-D botnet, though Nikolaenko's identity was not yet known at the time. Investigation Nikolaenko had been in the United States to attend the 2009 SEMA auto show at the Las Vegas Convention Center The FBI got a break in the case in August 2009, when Jody M. Smith pleaded guilty in Missouri to selling counterfeit Rolex watches. Federal agents used grand jury subpoenas to trace financial payments of $459,000 from convicted New Zealand spammer Lance Atkinson to Nikolaenko, who had been using the alias of \\"Docent\\". Google provided the FBI with Nikolaenko's e-mail records. Investigators subpoenaed his travel records from the U.S. State Department, which indicated that he had visited New York City, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas over the course of two trips in 2009. However, the Constitution of Russia specifically prohibits the extradition of its citizens. In November 2009, FireEye, a computer security firm, was able to shut down servers in the United States under the control of the Mega-D botnet. Nikolaenko, who had been in Las Vegas, Nevada to attend the 2009 SEMA auto show, was forced to return to Russia two days early to undo the damage to Mega-D's functionality. By the end of 2009, Nikolaenko was able to restore capacity to generate 17% of worldwide spam. Arrest and legal proceedings The Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas, where Nikolaenko was arrested in 2010. Nikolaenko returned to Las Vegas to attend the 2010 SEMA Show and was apprehended by federal agents at the Bellagio Hotel on November 4. He was found with two passports and $4,000 cash. Nikolaenko was transported to face charges in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where an undercover agent ordered Viagra from an alleged e-mail spam and instead received herbal pills. Nikolaenko was indicted on November 16 at the U.S. District Court of Eastern Wisconsin and faced up to five years in prison. He was accused of deliberately falsifying the header information of commercial e-mails and sending over 2,500 spam e-mails per day, both in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. He was extradited to Wisconsin and assigned a case #: 2:10-cr-00246-CNC-1 in the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Nikolaenko pleaded not guilty and retained defense attorney Christopher Van Wagner, who stated: \\"We're prepared to present a rigorous defense.\\" Wagner requested that Nikolaenko be released on bail as his wife and daughter were planning to travel from Moscow to the United States to attend the trial. However, bail was denied by U.S. Magistrate Judge Patricia Gorence. On December 21, 2010, Federal prosecutors turned over 4,600 of 6,000 pages of documents to Nikolaenko's attorney for pre-trial discovery. Information was redacted for the protection of witnesses. The trial was scheduled to begin by February 11, 2011, but later was adjourned. Nikolaenko later fired Wagner and retained criminal defense attorney Arkady L. Bukh who stated that \\"the previous motions by Nikolaenko's lawyers had been ruled by the judge in favor of the prosecution\\".Russian \\"King of Spam\\" has a new lawyer, Press Release. June 2011. Bukh Law Firm, PC - 14 Wall St, New York NY 10005 - (212) 729-1632. NYC Criminal Lawyer In June 2012, Nikolaenko agreed to a plea deal. On February 27, 2013, he was sentenced to time served plus three years of probation.http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/195458101.html The M86 Security company stated that spam output from Nikolaenko's Mega-D botnet fell below 5% of the worldwide total by December 2010. Spam e-mail traffic dropped sharply worldwide during the 2010 holiday period while Nikolaenko was detained, though Paul Wood of computer security firm Symantec attributed the downturn to the disruption of various other botnets, including Rustok, Lethic and Xarvester. According to information technology experts, Mega-D is no longer considered a very large network, though it may have been the largest designed specifically for spam.

The largest of four libraries on the Oxford campus, it serves as the primary library facility and center of administration for the Miami University Libraries system. Currently, King Library is home to the Walter Havighurst Special Collections, Miami University Archives, Western College for Women Archives, the Center for Information Management (CIM), Government Information & Law collection, Instructional Materials Center (IMC), Center for Digital Scholarship, Technical Services, Access Services, Libraries Systems, senior administrative offices, and the Libraries' Preservation/Conservation Lab. King also serves as home to the Howe Center for Writing Excellence, as well as the King Cafe Coffee Shop. King was extensively renovated through a three-phase rehabilitation project, beginning in the late 1990s and ending in 2007. Originally built to be a central library facility with subject areas divided up by levels. By 1978, the Brill Science Library was added to the west wing of Hughes Hall, and science collections were transferred there to accommodate an ever-expanding collection.  History  Hepburn hall in 1908 after the fire. In the early 1900s, the site of King Library was held by Hepburn Hall, a residence building for women. The shortage of housing forced some women to live in the attic about the third floor. Because some of the lights were defective, some residents had to strike matches to find their way and it was rumored that some women used the attic as a smoking lounge. Due to these circumstances, a major fire burned down Hepburn Hall on January 14, 1908. King Library was originally known as the King Undergraduate Library when the south section was completed in 1966. When the north section was completed in 1972, the word ‚Äúundergraduate‚Äù was dropped from its name. Before King Library was built, Alumni Library was used as the main university library. When King Library was completed in 1972, Alumni Library was changed to Alumni Hall. When the library opened in 1966, sixty volunteer fraternity men transferred 40,000 volumes, pushing book trucks up and down ramps across the quad from the old Alumni library. The building was named after Edgar Weld King, who funded the construction. Dedication to Edgar King and the library was held on February 17, 1973 at King Library, where he gave a speech in front of the university.  Construction  In total, King Library cost $3.574 million to build. The building was completed in two phases: the first phase, the south wing, was designed by the architecture firm, Lorenz and Williams, and built by Frank Messer and Sons of Cincinnati; the architects of record for the north wing were Lorenz and Williams and Lively and Likens, with Danis serving as general contractor. The south section was finished in 1966 and the north section was finished in 1972. The building consists of four floors: the basement, first floor, second floor, and third floor.  Edgar Weld King  King Library was named after Edgar Weld King. He was born in Berlin, Germany on December 24, 1893. After earning an A.B. degree at Oberlin College in 1916, King received a diploma from the Library School of New York University and a Master of Arts degree from Columbia University in 1922. That year, he was appointed librarian at Miami and served continuously until his retirement in 1956. In 1957, the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters was conferred on him by Miami. During his tenure the library grew from 67,000 volumes to over 350,000 volumes.

Prior to being a building, the area where Pearson Hall stands now was known as Miami Field, Miami University‚Äôs original athletic field. The building caters to a wide range of different science departments including ecology, genetics, biology, and neuroscience. Some of the notable features of Pearson Hall are its Electron Microscope Facility and the Animal Care Facility. Pearson Hall also is home to two large aquatic Animal rooms used to replicate oceanic and freshwater environments. Another feature of Pearson is its instruments in the environmental and ecological toxicology department, which enables an array of different testing‚Äôs and analysis to be conducted within the building. The Behavioral ecology department has a special laboratory used for hormonal analysis and behavioral testing. The entomology department contains an insect collection of over 82,000 specimens. History In 1986 The Biological Sciences Building was constructed in the previous location of Miami Universities historic Miami Field. The Ribbon Cutting Ceremony was held at 8 AM, on November 1, 1986. The attendance included many Ohio government officials, professors, donors, and Miami Staff.

Nelson turned the house into a popular gathering spot for farmers and politicians that it was for a time dubbed the \\"House of Politics.\\" He had carpenters build an outdoor staircase to the second floor to provide easy access so county politicians and farmers could meet in the upstairs rooms to discuss issues of the day. In addition, delegations of farmers would assemble to discuss upcoming prices and other problems they would face. The farmers would often be joined by their wives, which would add to the communal nature of the home. Nelson moved to nearby Kasson and willed the house and a section of land to a niece who lived in Wisconsin. Though it remained in the family's ownership for many years, it was rented to tenants and suffered from neglect. By the time the house and farm were purchased by Walter and Ruth Buehler in 1950, it still lacked modern plumbing and heating equipment. After purchasing the property, the Buehlers spend two years and an estimated $40,000 restoring and renovating the property.

Review: \\"Goya's 'Black' Paintings. Truth and Reason in Light and Liberty\\" by Priscilla E. Muller. The Burlington Magazine, vol. 128, no. 1000, July 1986. 506-508 (Spanish: Dos Mujeres Y Un Hombre) are names given to a painting likely completed between 1820‚Äì1823Licht, 159 by the Spanish artist Francisco Goya. It is one of Goya's 14 Black Paintings, a series created in despair near the end of his life on the walls of his home, Quinta del Sordo, and is oppressively dark in both mood and colour. It shows two women with maniacal smiles seemingly laughing at a simple-minded man who appears to be masturbating at the right hand of the picture. Despite their jeers, the woman to the left may also be masturbating, which ‚Äî in the absence of any written or oral comment from Goya on any work on the series ‚Äî art critics and historians believe lends to the image's futile and sterile intent. The Black Paintings are housed in the Museo del Prado, Madrid. Background At the age of 75, living alone and in mental and physical despair, he completed the work as one of his 14 Black Paintings, his final major series, which were executed in oil directly onto the plaster walls of the house he was living in outside Madrid. Goya did not intend for any of these paintings to be seen by others; they were executed during an intense period of physical, mental and political disillusionment, and he never spoke or wrote about them. Although today they are considered amongst the most important works of his output, it was not until some 50 years after his death, around 1874, that they were taken down and transferred to a canvas support. Description Men Reading is often seen as a companion work, a male counterpart to the feminine Two Women, and can be seen with equal likelihood in terms of group caught in the act of masturbation; in this instance massaging their collective egoes. The work shows three figures, generally thought to be two witch-like women and one man, huddled together against a black background and lit from the front left. The intended meaning of the work is highly obscure. The background is devoid of setting or detail, and no context is given as to who these people might be, what they are captured doing, or where the scene is set. The figure at right, facing the viewer, is generally presumed to be male. His hands are around his crotch; he appears to be either masturbating, exposing himself or simply mentally retarded. According to art critic Fred Licht, \\"The sickly grin of his face certainly seems indicative of some sort of sexual compulsion\\".Licht, 174 The two women are likely prostitutes,Goya tended to portray whores in pairs and leer with mocking expressions and broad sinister smiles, seemingly ignoring the male figure. Some critics have speculated that the lower, concealed, portion of the canvas hides the fact that the woman on the far left is also masturbating. Support for this view draws from the strange smiles and expressions on both women's faces, which are equally grotesque as the man's. According to Licht \\"there may be an element of self-mockery in this painting, some equation between the ironic loneliness of the exhibitionist (whose aim of attracting people is constantly thwarted by the means he obsessively adopts to capture attention) and the artist who also bares himself without shame or restraint and who is also doomed to being railed at as an aberration.\\" Like most of the other works in the series, X-ray shows that the canvas was repainted and reworked before the final version was settled on. The position of the foremost figure's hand changed, and it is possible that the two female figures were, in an early version, shown reading a book resting on a man's knees.Junquera, 76 Licht notes this contradictory approach to sexuality in many of Goya's works; while he was unflinching and realistic \\"to the point of crass\\" in depicting humanity as it actually is, he was often coy, reserved, and almost prudish in depicting sexual scenes, usually hiding or obscuring genitals, even in his depictions of naked male flayed figures in his The Disasters of War etchings. Although the 14 paintings in the series are not linked thematically, they share characteristics. They are all predominantly dark; Goya began each with a thick overlay of black paint on top of which he etched the figures with lighter shades of whites, grays, blues and green. As with the current work, they are painted with broad slashing brush strokes. And as with this work, each has at the center what Robert Hughes describes as \\"a gaping hole...[a] gaping void\\" ‚Äì the subject's open mouth.Hughes, 382 Women Laughing is often seen as a companion piece to Men Reading; both are vertical rather than horizontal and smaller in scale than the other works. Both are thematically less dark than the other works in the series, although they are chromatically darker.Fern√°ndez, G. \\"Goya: The Black Paintings\\". theartwolf.com, August 2006. Retrieved 15 January 2010. According to the c. 1828‚Äì1830 inventory of Goya's friend, Antonio Brugada, Women Laughing was situated opposite Men Reading on the smaller walls of the upper floor of the Quinta.Junquera, 44 Today it is housed in the Museo del Prado, Madrid.

Journal. 2010. <> As indicated by the title, the book, Burke's 16th published work, consists of ‚Äúmany of Burke's essays which have appeared in widely diverse periodicals‚Äù and has thus been regarded as one of the most significant resources for studying and comprehending Burke‚Äôs ideas.Smith, Nelson J. III. ‚ÄúReview: [untitled].‚Äù Philosophy & Rhetoric 1.3 (1968): 187.  Overview of Book  Language as Symbolic Action is divided into three parts: (1) Five Summarizing Essays (2) Particular Works and Authors and (3) Further Essays on Symbolism in General.  Five Summarizing Essays  The first of Burke‚Äôs five essays is the ‚ÄúDefinition of man‚Äù which defines man as > . . .the symbol-using (symbol-making, symbol-misusing) animal, inventor of > the negative (or moralized by the negative), separated from his natural > condition by instruments of his own making, goaded by the spirit of > hierarchy (or moved by the sense of order), and rotten with > perfection.Burke, Kenneth. Language as Symbolic Action: Essays on Life, > Literature, and Method. (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966) 16. The next chapter ‚ÄúPoetics in Particular, Language in General‚Äù returns to a discussion of perfection continued from the previous chapter. Burke summarizes this chapter by stating: > The poetic motive does indeed come to a head in the principle of perfection > . . . But the principle of perfection should not be viewed in too simple a > sense. We should also use the expression ironically . . . the motive of > perfection may extend to areas far beyond the confines of poetry and > poetics.Burke 38-39. Osborn explains this concept further: ‚Äú. . . a truly rigorous attempt to account for a single work on the grounds of poetics alone should force recognition that it is necessary to go beyond poetics-in-particular to language-in-general. . .‚ÄùOsborn, Neal J. ‚ÄúToward the Quintessential Burke.‚Äù The Hudson Review 21.2 (1968): 320. Perfection, according to Burke and similar scholars, is a motive that exists both in literature and beyond, as an underlying human desire that drives much symbolic action. The third and often- referenced chapter ‚ÄúTerministic Screens‚Äù makes use of many key terms of Burke‚Äôs ‚Äúdramatistic‚Äù approach to literary and rhetorical criticism. Burke begins the chapter by explaining the ‚Äúscientistic‚Äù and the ‚Äúdramatistic.‚Äù ‚Äú‚ÄòA scientistic approach begins with questions of naming, or definition‚Äô(44). A ‚Äòdramatistic‚Äô approach stresses ‚Äòlanguage as an aspect of ‚Äòaction,‚Äô that is, symbolic action‚Äô(44).‚ÄùWessels, Emanuelle, Justin Killian, and Sean Larson. ‚ÄúOutlines of Kenneth Burke‚Äôs Writings: Language as Symbolic Action.‚Äù Resources on Kenneth Burke. 12 May 2009. < http://www.comm.umn.edu/burke/LASA.html> Burke explains that, through the concept of terministic screens, > ‚Äúany nomenclature necessarily directs the attention into some channels > rather than others.‚Äù This can be obvious, such as how different academic > subjects direct the attention, or more subtle. Burke illustrates the latter > point with an example of how photos of the same objects using different > color filters reflected and deflected his attention in different ways, > depending on the filter (45).Wessels, Emanuelle, Justin Killian, and Sean > Larson. ‚ÄúOutlines of Kenneth Burke‚Äôs Writings: Language as Symbolic Action.‚Äù > Resources on Kenneth Burke. 12 May 2009. < > http://www.comm.umn.edu/burke/LASA.html> Terministic screens is significant to the process of rhetorical criticism, as well as understanding rhetoric, because terministic screens are a conduit to understanding reality.  Particular Works and Authors  The 11 chapters comprising Part II engage in rhetorical criticism of, among others, Shakespeare‚Äôs Antony and Cleopatra, the Oresteia, Faust, and William Carlos Williams.  Further Essays on Symbolism in General  Part III consists of eight chapters. One of the more significant of these is chapter six, entitled ‚ÄúMedium as Message.‚Äù Burke takes one of his peers, Marshall McLuhan, to task for focusing too much on the media rather than the symbolic resources of language. > Burke‚Äôs main criticism of McLuhan stems from his most memorable slogan and > the undue emphasis put on medium. ‚ÄúIf the medium is the message, obviously > the important thing is not what somebody says in a given medium, but what > medium he uses, regardless of what he says. . . The medium is the message. > Hence, down with content analysis‚Äù (413).Wessels, Emanuelle, Justin Killian, > and Sean Larson. ‚ÄúOutlines of Kenneth Burke‚Äôs Writings: Language as Symbolic > Action.‚Äù Resources on Kenneth Burke. 12 May 2009. < > http://www.comm.umn.edu/burke/LASA.html> Burke continues the discussion on the relative importance of medium to message by acknowledging the relationship as significant and stating that certain content can be better delivered by or suited to a specific medium.Wessels, Emanuelle, Justin Killian, and Sean Larson. ‚ÄúOutlines of Kenneth Burke‚Äôs Writings: Language as Symbolic Action.‚Äù Resources on Kenneth Burke. 12 May 2009. < http://www.comm.umn.edu/burke/LASA.html>  Reception  Burke‚Äôs ideas, through these significant essays, have had widespread influence. Burke scholar Nelson J. Smith III offered this review: ‚ÄúMuch of what our current generation of rhetoricians accomplishes will be drawn from the preliminary and pioneer investigations into the sociology of ideology by Kenneth Burke.‚ÄùSmith, Nelson J. III. ‚ÄúReview: [untitled].‚Äù Philosophy & Rhetoric 1.3 (1968): 189. Frederick J. Hoffman also writes: ‚Äú[Burke‚Äôs] range and scope are truly remarkable. If there are predecessors and contemporaries in this respect, they are probably Remy de Gourmont. . .and Eric Auerbach. . . His fate is that of a man some years ahead of his time.‚ÄùHoffman, Frederick J. ‚ÄúReview: Kenneth Burke‚Äôs Great Range.‚Äù Poetry 111.6 (1968): 418. The range of critical ideas and practices included in Language as Symbolic Action help scholars explore this breadth.

Life Thomas Chilcot of Bath, Somerset was born in the West of England (probably Bath) in or about 1707.Biography from Tim Rishton, 'Thomas Chilcot and his concertos' except where otherwise stated He was the son of John Chilcot and Elizabeth Powell.St. Peter's Tawstock, Effigies: http://sites.rootsweb.com/~ukdevon/TawstockInsideMIs.htm Records of his birth, like most other records from his life, are now lost. Chilcot was educated at Bath Charity School, whose headmaster, Henry Dixon, had a strong interest in church music. On 6 July 1721 Chilcot (presumably aged 14) was apprenticed to Josiah Priest, the organist of Bath Abbey since 1714 - seemingly the only occasion on which the school allowed a pupil to be apprenticed to a musician.Thomas Chilcot and His Concertos: The Chilcot Family in Bath, p. 12 http://www.rishton.info/pubs/chilcotthesis.pdf On Priest's death, just four years later, Chilcot was made Abbey organist on a probationary basis. At what should have been the conclusion of Chilcot's apprenticeship, in 1728, the appointment was made permanent. As City musician in fashionable Bath, Chilcot rapidly established a remarkable relationship with many noble families, attracting their patronage and subscriptions to his publications. He became a member and subsequently Grand Master of the Royal Cumberland Lodge of Freemasons. He was also amongst the original members of the Royal Society of Musicians, founded in 1738/1739. As well as his work at the Abbey, Chilcot organised and directed some ambitious choral concerts (at which he played his own concertos) and appears also to have run a small instrument hire business. He married Elizabeth Mills of Bath in 1729 and had seven children, of whom four survived. Following Elizabeth's death, he married Anne Wrey, a member of a prominent West Country family (the Wrey baronets), in 1749. Chilcot died suddenly on 24 November 1766, after occupying a highly influential role in Bath for forty years. Almost no public notice was taken of his death and a complicated disagreement over Chilcot's estate meant that none of the elaborate arrangements that the composer had made for his own funeral procession, monument and memorial trusts, were ever carried out.Tim Rishton, 'The twelve harpsichord concertos of Thomas Chilcot', p.34 Works Chilcot's unpublished music, including at least four anthems, a Jubilate, an oratorio called Elfrida and what a posthumous auction catalogue describes as \\"his finest pieces of Music ... never Printed or Sold\\", has not survived.Tim Rishton, 'The twelve harpsichord concertos of Thomas Chilcot', p.34 His published music consists of: * Six Suites of Lessons for the Harpsicord or Spinet (London, Wm Smith, 1734).

Of ‚ÄòAchatina‚Äô vassei only the holotype was known up to 2010. The collector of the type shell, Guillaume Vasse, was a French big game hunter, who spent roughly two years (1904-1907) in central Mozambique with his wife, collecting mammals, birds, insects, molluscs (very few), and plants for the Paris Museum of Natural History. The type specimen is stored in the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle, Paris (MNHN Mollusca No. 21490). Another discovery of shells at a second locality was published in 2010. Those shells are stored in the Netherlands Centre for Biodiversity Naturalis, Leiden. There appears to be no other museum or collection that holds material of this species. The systematic position of this species is still unclear because of the lack of anatomical data; this taxon is probably a species with a restricted range centered on the plateau of Central Mozambique. Distribution This species is probably endemic to Central Mozambique. This is an area where little malacological exploration has been carried out. The type locality is \\"environs d‚ÄôAndrada\\", Andrada (18¬∞52‚ÄôS 32¬∞53‚ÄôE), Mozambique. It is situated just east of the border with Zimbabwe northeast of Mutare. Another shell has been collected from Gorongosa National Park, Sofala Province in Mozambique and published in 2010.  Shell description  apex of Achatina vassei The somewhat thin and fragile shell is small compared to what is known from the other achatinids in southern Africa, its length/height is less than 45 mm with about 7¬Ω whorls. (This description is in contradiction to Connolly (1925), page 169. who probably attributes a wrongly identified shell 63.2 mm long to this taxon ‚Äì a statement not repeated in his 1939 monograph.) The length is always more than two times the maximum diameter, which is situated at about the level of the apex of the aperture. The length of the aperture is always less than half that of the shell; the length of the last whorl in front view is always under three quarters of the total length. The apex is comparatively blunt. The whorls are hardly convex, including the body whorl. The aperture is fairly narrow (greatest width just under the middle) with a thin outer lip; the columella is white, short and narrow, concave with a slight twist, obliquely truncate close to the base. The nepionic whorls are wrinkled and granulose, though always worn in the material studied. The sculpture consists of regular and close wrinkles resulting in a reticulate- granulate pattern, very prominent below the sutures but well visible on all whorls; in addition there are very faint growth striae. All specimens exhibit a close and fine zebra pattern with irregular, orange-brown flames on a yellowish-brown background; there is a very thin and deciduous periostracum. On the whole this seems to be a well-defined taxon because of the size, shape and sculpture of the shell. {|apertural view. ||lateral view. ||abapertural view. |}  Anatomy  There is dried animal present in the shell of the holotype of Achatina vassei. Unfortunately no material is available for investigating the vital genital anatomy. Incidentally, the animal of the type is still present withdrawn in the shell. This implies that, after more than a century, at least studies of a molecular nature and of the radula are still feasible. However, the latter can only be done after destroying the shell which for a holotype of a presumably rare species is certainly not advisable. At the moment no suggestion as to generic classification of ‚ÄòAchatina‚Äô vassei can be made. References This article incorporates CC-BY-3.0 text from the reference.Bruggen A.

'This week,' writes Evelyn, 'a most execrable murder was committed on Dr. Clench, father of that extraordinary learned child whom I have before noticed. Under pretence of carrying him in a coach to see a patient, they strangled him in it, and sending away the coachman under some pretence, they left his dead body in the coach, and escaped in the dusk of the evening'. A swindler named Henry Harrison, to whose mistress Clench had lent money, was convicted of the murder and hanged on 15 April 1692. By his wife Rose, Clench had two sons, Edmund and John. From his will, we learn that he died possessed of property in Norfolk, of the manor and advowson of Monk Soham, Suffolk, and the lordship of Blomvile's or Woodcroft Hall in the same parish. Evelyn has left a charming account of Clench's gifted son referred to above, who, when Evelyn saw him, was not twelve years old. It is gratifying to know that no pressure was brought to bear upon him, and that he usually played amongst other boys four or five hours every day, and that he was as earnest at his play as at his study'.

Until 2009, the building was home to the School of Business Administration, hosting classes of accountancy, finance, economics, management, supply chain and marketing. The building is under construction and is being renovated to become a library for multiple schools at Miami University. Miami often renovates buildings after 40 years, which is one of the many reasons Laws Hall is under construction. The introduction of the Farmer School of Business made Laws Hall obsolete for the business school, and its purpose is being changed and discussed. History In September 1959, the building, which was called Laws Hall after the dedication in October, was built. The School of Business Administration was one of the most elite in the country at the time, and was one of the earliest introduced, compared to other similar schools. Students would study the fundamentals of business within Laws Hall. It was one of the biggest and most advanced buildings on campus at the time it was built. The building cost $1,701,000 when it was built 1959. The general contractor for the build was Knowlton Construction. The gross square footage of the building is 69,454 and was one of the largest academic buildings on Miami's campus when it was first opened. Laws Hall was the meeting place for many student associations and business meetings. The building's second floor was intended and designed for large conferences for the respected officers of the university to make important decisions affecting the school. Procter & Gamble donates large amounts annually to the school. As the school for Business Administration, P&G; helped fund the construction, which in turn led the university to dedicate the second floor east hallway to the company. Samuel Spahr Laws (1824-1921) The Business Administration building was dedicated on October 9, 1959 after Samuel Spahr Laws, class of 1848. An employer of Thomas A. Edison, inventor of the stock market ticker, minister, lawyer, physician, financier, vice president and manager of the New York Gold Exchange, and college president of the University of Missouri. He was named as one of the most illustrious graduates of Miami University, whose worldly impact was to never be forgotten on Miami's grounds through the dedication of \\"Laws Hall.\\" Because Laws Hall was built to house the School of Business Administration, this selection seemed fitting. Future In 1999, the steering committee determined that the School of Business would no longer function in Laws Hall and Upham Hall and potential sites were researched and studied. The university sought for the School of Business to be housed in one building to improve programs, student services and effective communication. The new instructional spaces will reflect a shift toward small-group work, seminar instruction, and experiential learning. Ted Christian, the Laws Hall project manager said \\"Laws Hall is currently going through rehabilitation. Because the building was built in 1959, Miami University tries to rehabilitate the building about every 40 years to make sure they're current and energy efficient.\\" When the project is finished, the bottom two floors of Laws Hall will be a library for science, business, engineering and psychology. It is projected that this project will be complete next fall. The inside of Laws Hall will be updated with new flooring, new paint and new furniture. The school stated that because of the small sizes of new classes and more offerings of different times for classes, some business might still be hosted in Laws Hall.

Humphries, 562 U.S. 29 (2010), is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that clarified one of the requirements for imposing liability on a municipality for violations of a federal right, in lawsuits brought under Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (codified at 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983).. The Court had previously ruled in Monell v. Department of Social Services of the City of New York, , that municipalities could only be liable under Section 1983 if the injury was a result of that municipality's \\"policy or custom.\\". In Los Angeles County v. Humphries, the Court ruled that this \\"policy or custom\\" requirement applied regardless of whether the relief the plaintiff sought was monetary or prospective..  Background of the case Section 1983 of the 1871 Civil Rights Act Section 1983 provides in part: > Every person who, under color of any [state] statute, ordinance, regulation, > custom, or usage . . . subjects, or causes to be subjected, any ... other > person ... to the deprivation of any rights ... secured by the Constitution > and laws [of the United States], shall be liable to the party injured in an > action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress. In Monroe v. Pape, the Supreme Court had held that municipal entities were not \\"person[s]\\" under ¬ß 1983, based on its reading of the history of the Civil Rights Act of 1871.. However, the Court overruled Monroe in Monell v. Department of Social Services of the City of New York, holding that municipalities were \\"persons\\" under ¬ß 1983, but that a municipality could be held liable under ¬ß 1983 only for its own violations of federal law. The violation must be caused by the \\"execution of [the municipality's] policy or custom\\", not simply when others have caused the violation such as if the municipality \\"employ[ed] a tortfeasor.\\"Monell, 436 U.S. at 690‚Äì94. Lower court proceedings The California Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting ActCal. Penal Code Ann. ¬ß 11164 et seq. (West Rev. Supp. 2010) required law enforcement and other state agencies to investigate allegations of child abuse, report all instances of reported child abuse the agency found ‚Äúnot unfounded‚Äù to the California Department of Justice, even if they were \\"inconclusive or unsubstantiated\\",Cal. Penal Code Ann. ¬ß¬ß 11169(a), 11170(a)(3). and required the department to include the reports in a Child Abuse Central Index. However, the Act did not provide procedures for reviewing whether a previously filed report was unfounded or for allowing individual people to challenge their inclusion in the index. Two parents who were accused of child abuse but exonerated sought to have their names removed from the Index but were unable to convince the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department to remove them. They consequently filed a ¬ß1983 case against the Attorney General of California, the Los Angeles County Sheriff, two detectives in the sheriff's department, and the County of Los Angeles, seeking damages, an injunction, and a declaration that the defendants had deprived them of their constitutional rights by failing to create a procedural mechanism through which one could contest inclusion in the Index. The Ninth Circuit held in favor of the plaintiffs. Los Angeles County appealed, arguing that it was not liable because, with respect to the county, the plaintiffs were not prevailing parties because the county was a municipal entity. It argued that under Monell's holding, a municipal entity is liable under ¬ß 1983 only if a municipal \\"policy or custom\\" caused a plaintiff to be deprived of a federal right and it was state policy, not county policy, that brought about any deprivation here.Monell, 436 U.S. at 694.  The Court's decision  In an 8-0 decision delivered by Justice Stephen Breyer,Justice Elena Kagan, who was appointed to the Court on August 7, 2010, did not participate. the Court concluded that Monell's holding applied to ¬ß 1983 claims against municipalities for prospective relief as well as to claims for damages.

Life and career Kaufman was born in Manhattan, on February 10, 1929, and raised in Queens and later the Bronx. After a variety of jobs, including night cosmetician, she started in the restaurant business in 1959, joining Alfredo Viazzi--then her boyfriend--in running his recently opened Greenwich Village restaurant Portofino. Portofino was frequented by people in the downtown publishing business and Off-Broadway theater. Four years later, after she and Viazzi split up, Elaine bought a restaurant in Manhattan's Upper East Side, and Elaine's was born. Despite the location--not popular at the time--many customers from Portofino followed her to the new spot. Her original intent was that the restaurant would be a writer's dive, incubating authors. Over the years, Kaufman bought the entire building that housed the restaurant, as well as the building next door. The rental income subsidized the restaurant in lean years. Kaufman was designated a living landmark by the New York Landmarks Conservancy in 2003. In addition to her career as a restaurateur, Kaufman had a small uncredited acting role in the 1970 film The Boys in the Band (1970), as a pedestrian glancing disapprovingly at flamboyant Emory (Cliff Gorman) on a Manhattan street corner. She also had a brief appearance in the film Morning Glory (2010) as herself at her restaurant.

The Winecoff Hotel fire of December 7, 1946, in Atlanta, Georgia, which claimed 119 lives, is the deadliest hotel fire disaster in the history of the United States. 1880s Newhall House Hotel On January 10, 1883, a fire destroyed the Newhall House Hotel in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, killing 71 people. The disaster was investigated by reporters of The Daily Journal (now Milwaukee Journal), newly edited by Lucius W. Nieman. The paper reported an \\"appalling story of neglect, falsehood, manipulation and concealing of truth that preceded the tragedy.\\"Scott Cutlip (Fall !964) \\"Portrait without blemishes\\", Columbia Journalism Review, pp 42,3 The Journal 's expose√© secured it subscriptions, giving it viability in Milwaukee's competitive newspaper market. The city block where Newall house was located became Milwaukee's \\"death block\\" when Fire Chief James Foley and three firemen died there in 1903. Then October 26, 1913, seven people, including some firemen, died fighting fire on the block. 1890s Windsor Hotel On March 17, 1899, in the deadliest hotel fire in New York City's history, the Windsor Hotel was destroyed, with approximately 86 being killed. 1900s Park Avenue Hotel On February 22, 1902, the Park Avenue Hotel in New York City was partially destroyed by a million-dollar fire that killed at least 14. 1910s Hotel Adams Fire The Hotel Adams in Phoenix, Arizona was completely destroyed by an early morning fire which started in the hotel's basement. Two people were killed in the blaze. 1930s Kerns Hotel Kerns Hotel in its early days, shown at left in background. The three-story Hotel Wentworth shown in the foreground survived the fire. On December 11, 1934, shortly before 5:30 am, a fire broke out in the Kerns Hotel in Lansing, Michigan. 34 people died and 44 were injured, including 14 firemen. The 211-room four-story hotel had been constructed of brick with a wooden interior, and the fire spread rapidly, trapping many of the hotel's 215 guests inside their rooms and forcing them to escape via fire ladders or life nets. Among the dead were seven Michigan state legislators: state senator John Leidlein and state representatives T. Henry Howlett, Charles D. Parker, Vern Voorhees, John W. Goodwine, Don E. Sias, and D. Knox Hanna, who were in town for a special session of the state legislature. Several other state legislators were injured, but survived. The fire was thought to have been caused by careless smoking. It is regarded by the Lansing Fire Department as the worst fire disaster in Lansing's history. Terminal Hotel On May 16, 1938, a fire broke out in the Terminal Hotel in Atlanta, Georgia, killing 35 people, although some sources claim the death toll was either 27 or 34. The five-story hotel was located at Spring and Mitchell Streets across the street from Terminal Station in the Hotel Row District. The fire broke out in the basement and shortly afterwards a bellhop heard a kitchen boy yell, \\"O Lawdy, fire\\". The fire spread quickly, choking off fire escapes and stairs just a few seconds after it caught. The building was fully ablaze minutes after the alarm bell sounded shortly after 3:00 a.m. Soon after the fire team arrived, the roof collapsed, hampering rescue efforts. Traffic was blocked off for blocks around since the walls were also in danger of collapsing. One hotel guest reported having to jump from the second-floor elevator cage. Several people were killed leaping from the building, including William Oscar Webster, a railroad engineer from Columbus, Georgia, who had jumped from a fourth-floor window. Firemen reported that they later found a whole family dead in one room, a woman in a rocking chair, a man and a boy stretched across the bed, and a girl kneeling by it. George P. Jones, the hotel manager, reported that there were about 75 people in the hotel at the time of the fire; a substantial number of them were railroad workers. The hotel was rebuilt in 1938 and not included in the Hotel Row District. 1940s Marlborough Hotel On January 3, 1940, a fire broke out in the aging Marlborough Hotel in Minneapolis, Minnesota, killing 19 people. It was the city's deadliest fire. The fire burned quickly through walls and doors and engulfed most of the hotel's 56 single rooms and 23 apartment units, where some 123 tenants were sleeping. The guests either fled through the corridors with coats over their heads or jumped from their rooms and were killed because the stairways were blocked by the fire. Some fell to their deaths when floors collapsed, notably the second floor, and buried them in the basement under tons of debris. One child was trapped on the third floor of the hotel and screamed for 15 minutes before he died in the flames. One man, James Brown, pushed his wife Mabel out of the window when she refused to jump; she was killed but he survived. Another woman jumped head-first out of the window and was killed instantly. A resident across the street reported that he awoke to hear \\"the worst screams I ever heard\\" and saw that half the block in which the hotel was located was completely ablaze. Fifteen fire engines and five trucks containing some 130 firemen were called to the fire in icy January conditions, temperature ‚àí5 ¬∞C. At least 40 people were injured in the fire including 2 firemen and 23 required hospital treatment. The hotel was completely gutted and reduced just to a \\"charred hollow rectangle\\". Fire chief Huttner initially though the fire was caused by a boiler that had exploded in the furnace room, but it was later concluded that it was a \\"heat explosion\\" caused by a burning cigarette thrown into the garbage chute that had set fire to the thin wooden walls of the hotel. The garbage caught fire and became a ball of fire that exploded in \\"volcanic violence\\". Gulf Hotel On September 7, 1943, a fire broke out in the Gulf Hotel in downtown Houston, Texas, killing 55 people. The fire remains the deadliest in Houston's history. New Amsterdam Hotel On March 28, 1944, a fire, believed to have been deliberately set, destroyed the New Amsterdam Hotel in San Francisco, California. It was the worst fire in that city since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, killing 22 and injuring 27. On August 3, 1944, George Holman, a 47-year old cafe proprietor, was found guilty in San Francisco of 22 counts of murder in the first degree for setting the fire.Associated Press, ‚ÄúCafe Proprietor Found Guilty in Hotel Fire‚Äù, The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Saturday 5 August 1944, Volume 50, page 3.

La Salle Hotel La Salle Hotel in Chicago, Illinois On June 5, 1946, a fire broke out in the La Salle Hotel in Chicago, killing 61 people, many of them children. The fire began in the Silver Grill Cocktail Lounge on the lower floor on the LaSalle Street side adjacent to the lobby, spread quickly through the highly varnished wood paneling in the lounge and the mezzanine balcony overlooking the lobby, and rose through stairwells and shafts. According to the Chicago Fire Department the fire started either in the walls or in the ceiling at around 12:15 am, but they were not notified until 12:35 am. While a significant number died from the flames, a greater number of deaths were caused by suffocation from the smoke. Around 900 guests were able to leave the building but some 150 had to be rescued by the fire services and by members of the public, including two sailors who were reported to have rescued 27 people between them. Two-thirds of hotel fire deaths in 1946 occurred in the La Salle fire and that in the Winecoff in Atlanta. The La Salle fire prompted the Chicago city council to enact new hotel building codes and fire-fighting procedures, including the installation of automatic alarm systems and fire safety instructions inside hotel rooms. The hotel was refurbished after the fire and was finally demolished in July 1976; its lot is now occupied by the Two North LaSalle office building. Canfield Hotel On June 19, 1946, two weeks after the La Salle Hotel fire, a fire broke out in the six-story 200-room Canfield Hotel in Dubuque, Iowa, killing 19 people. The fire started around 11:30 pm in a closet near the cocktail lounge on the ground floor and destroyed the four-story section of the building, which was built in 1891. Contributing factors that added to the severity of this incident were delayed alarms, open stairways, and the presence of combustible materials. According to fire captain Harold Cosgrove, 30 people were rescued by jumping onto nets and 27 were carried down ladders. Winecoff Hotel Winecoff Hotel On December 7, 1946, a fire broke out in the Winecoff Hotel in Atlanta, Georgia, killing 119 people. it remained the worst hotel fire in United States history; it prompted many changes in building codes across the nation.: File:Winecoff-Hotel-Atlanta-03.jpg: Official plaque near the Winecoff Hotel The fire started in the 15-story building early in the morning, and engulfed all the floors of the hotel. The only route for people to escape was a single stairway; the building had no fire sprinklers, fire escapes, fire doors, or even an alarm bell. The fire spread throughout the building via the stairway. Caught unawares, many people were trapped on the upper floors, and most of the deaths were among people forced to jump. Atlanta fire fighters could reach only up to the eighth floor with ladders, and the nets they had spread could not hold many who jumped into them‚Äîholding capacity was limited to jumps from up to 70 ft‚Äîand many people died on the sidewalks behind the hotel. Guests at the hotel included teenagers attending a Tri-Y Youth Conference organized by the YMCA in the city, Christmas shoppers, and people in town to see the film Song of the South. Arnold Hardy, a 26-year-old graduate student at Georgia Tech, became the first amateur to win a Pulitzer Prize for Photography for his snapshot of a woman, later identified as survivor Daisy McCumber, in mid-air after jumping from the 11th floor of the hotel during the fire. McCumber, born in 1905, broke her back, pelvis and both legs, but survived. Over a ten-year period, she underwent seven surgeries and lost a leg, but still worked until retirement age and lived until 1992. A plaque was erected at the scene as a memorial to the dead and the survivors, and to the fire-fighters who, with limited resources, tackled the fire and its consequences. Due to its dark history, the rebuilt version of the hotel switched hands often until it was refurbished into the Ellis Hotel. The Ellis Hotel currently stands in the same spot in Peachtree as the Winecoff did. 1950s Barton Hotel Considered one of Chicago's worst flophouse blazes, a fire broke out in the five-story Barton Hotel on West Madison on February 12, 1955, killing 29 people and gutting the hotel, a 49-year-old structure with 336 tiny 4ftx6ft rooms with 7-ft high chicken-wire ceilings, where the nightly rate was 65 cents per person. There were 245 people staying at the hotel on the night of the fire. At 2:00 a.m., when the night manager came out of his office room to check a commotion in the hall, he discovered an already large fire that singed him badly. He immediately rang the fire alarm bell and rushed to wake guests by banging on room doors, but many were sleeping too soundly and he then ran out of the hotel. Many people who woke up were unable to escape and died in the rooms. A few broke the window panes and jumped out, or escaped down the fire escape. The fire department was also able to save some. 29 people died in the fire, many of them charred beyond recognition. The fire is attributed to a cigarette butt thrown accidentally by a 70-year-old man into a utensil containing alcohol used for massaging; he was killed. 1960s Surfside Hotel On November 18, 1963, a fire broke out in the Surfside Hotel convalescent home in Atlantic City, New Jersey, killing 25 people, mostly elderly Jews. The fire spread to adjacent buildings, all of which were closed for the season except for workmen, who were able to escape. Police suspected that the fire had been set by a known arsonist, who boarded a bus shortly after the fire started. Hotel Roosevelt The former Hotel Roosevelt, now the Carling Hotel On Sunday, December 29, 1963, a fire broke out in the 13-floor Hotel Roosevelt in Jacksonville, Florida, killing 22 people. The fire broke out at around 7:30 am in the ballroom ceiling due to faulty wiring, and by 7:45 am, the Jacksonville Fire Department had been called, later bringing three fire engines, two ladder trucks, a fire chief and two assistant chiefs; the mayor at the time, W. Haydon Burns, also requested eight helicopters from the U.S. Navy, and helicopters from Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Naval Air Reserve Training Unit Jacksonville, and Naval Air Station Cecil Field responded. By 9:30 am the fire had been suppressed, and approximately 475 people were successfully rescued, including four from the roof. However, 21 of the people who died in the fire died in their beds of smoke inhalation; the other fatality was assistant chief J.R. Romedy of the Jacksonville Fire Department, who died of a heart attack on the scene during the rescue effort. It was the worst single-day death toll in Jacksonville's history; even the Great Fire of 1901 had fewer fatalities. Extensive archives on the fire, including valuable photographs, exist within the Jacksonville Fire Museum. Hotel Carleton In January 1966, a fire broke out in the Hotel Carleton in St. Paul, Minnesota, killing 11 people. Paramount Hotel On January 28, 1966, a fire broke out in the 11-story Paramount Hotel in Boston, Massachusetts, killing 11 people and injuring 57. Preceding the fire, an odor of natural gas was detected in the stairway going down to the first floor. The explosion was caused by a gas leak from a main pipe in Boylston Street that seeped into the hotel's basement. Lane Hotel In September 1966, a fire broke out in the two-story 33-room frame Lane Hotel in the main business district of Anchorage, Alaska, killing 14 people. The fire started at 1:17 am and spread rapidly; the flames were reported to be very intense and many bodies were burned beyond recognition. However, several victims died of asphyxiation from the heavy wood smoke. More than half of the occupants of the hotel died in the fire; only 25 guests were reported to have been registered at the time. The owner of the hotel, Virgil McVicker, believed that the fire was caused by an explosion in the boiler room. 1970s Ozark Hotel On March 20, 1970, a fire caused by arson broke out in the lobby of the Ozark Hotel in Seattle, Washington, at about 2:30 am (a clock on the second floor had melted, showing the time as 2:45). It spread through two stairways and all the halls, killing 20 people (14 men and six women) and seriously injuring 10 others in a time span of 63 minutes until firefighters extinguished it. It was said to be the worst arson fire in Seattle. The hotel was a 60-year-old wooden building of five floors with 60 rooms and was a \\"flophouse\\" housing many impoverished and elderly people. It was well known as a \\"high risk facility\\" to the Seattle Fire Department, and had been inspected six times between February 6, 1970, and one day before the fire. On the night of the fire, 42 of the 62 rooms were occupied. The fire was set in two places; in the main stairwell on the first floor and in the rear of the second floor; a wayside straggler alerted the authorities. The fire quickly engulfed the two staircases and the lobby that separated them. Open transoms in the rooms helped spread the fire. The top two floors collapsed. Those who could not reach the fire escape tried to jump from the windows of their rooms. The saving grace in the building was an open core area with a large shaft up to the second floor, which enabled two people to escape. The fire department devoted 14 engines and 4 ladders with a complement of over 100 firemen and 20 units to the fire and were able to control it within 50 minutes. The deaths were from smoke inhalation, burns, cuts and other injuries. Since the building lacked modern fire fighting facilities, Seattle made major changes to its fire codes. However, the new rules are reported to have made many people homeless in the 1980s, since those living in low-income housing could not afford to make the mandated changes and hence deserted their houses. Even small hotels with single occupancy rooms could not adapt to the rules. The arsonists were never caught, despite a large police inquiry. Ponet Square Hotel On September 13, 1970, a fire broke out in the Ponet Square Hotel at Pico Boulevard and Grand Avenue in Los Angeles, killing 19 people. After the fire, safety doors to enclosed stairwells‚Äîlater known as \\"Ponet Doors\\", after the hotel‚Äîwere installed in all pre-1943 residential structures of three stories or more in Los Angeles. Pioneer International Pioneer International On December 20, 1970, a fire broke out in the 11-story Pioneer International on the corner of North Stone Avenue and Pennington Street in Tucson, Arizona, killing 28 people, including several children and teenagers, and injuring 27. 13 prominent Mexicans were among the dead, including two grandchildren of Ignacio Soto, a former governor of Sonora; the wife and five children of Francisco Luken, a Sonora police chief; and Jose Jesus Antillon, a top Mexican cardiologist. The hotel had been built in 1929. The fire started on the sixth floor and spread rapidly through the hallways and staircases, trapping more than 60 people, but most escaped through windows. The majority of the occupants of the hotel at the time were attending three different banquets on the ground floor and those 650 or so people were easily evacuated. Of the 28 who died, 16 died of carbon monoxide poisoning, 7 from burns and 1 from smoke inhalation. One woman died after jumping from the seventh floor and three others died from jumping, one of them a small boy, who was found on the lower east wing roof. Two firemen were injured, including a fire captain who hung upside down on a 45-foot broken ladder for 25 minutes before being rescued. Although the hotel was supposed to be fireproof, synthetic carpeting, vinyl wall covering, painted doors and frames and open stairways fueled the spread of the fire, especially given that there were no sprinklers or smoke detectors. The fire was reported to be an arson attack and a 16-year-old, Louis C. Taylor, was charged with felony homicide and arson. He was found guilty of starting a fire in at least two places in the hotel and was imprisoned for life, although he never admitted causing the fire. He was released on April 2, 2013 after his conviction was called into question. The hotel remained standing after the fire and was renovated in 1977 and converted into offices. Since the conversion, paranormal activity has frequently been reported in the building, including the smell of smoke during the night, running on the upper floors, lights turning on and off, and apparitions. Pennsylvania House Hotel On January 16, 1972, a fire broke out in the Pennsylvania House Hotel in Tyrone, Pennsylvania, killing 12 people. The 75-year-old hotel lacked alarm systems, sprinklers, smoke detectors, and stairway fire doors. None were required when the hotel was built, and there were no local safety codes that required subsequent installation. The temperature at the time of the fire was well below zero; firefighters had to change clothes frequently after being drenched thawing out hoses and hydrants, and ice axes were used to search for victims. 31 people were treated at Tyrone Hospital, including 28 volunteer firefighters, mainly for frostbite and smoke inhalation rather than burns. Washington House Hotel At about 2:30 am on August 25, 1974, a fire broke out in the Washington House Hotel at the corner of Fairfax and Washington Streets in Berkeley Springs, West Virginia, killing 12 people and spreading from the brick building to seven adjoining buildings. The fire's intense heat melted the face of the clock in the tower of the Morgan County Courthouse. Pomona Hotel On July 7, 1975, a fire broke out in the Pomona Hotel in Portland, Oregon, killing 11 people (initially reported as eight). 26 were injured, 8 of them critically. The alarm was raised about 11 pm when smoke was seen drifting out of a second-story window and a man was hanging from a window; he was later rescued by firemen. The extent of the fire was minimal but it created considerable thick smoke, which hampered rescue efforts. The fire was ruled arson and a suspect was taken into custody, having been seen at the hotel and purchasing gasoline. Hotel Pathfinder Hotel Pathfinder explosion. View of fire crew and debris looking south-east from Broad and 6th St. in Fremont, Nebraska On January 10, 1976, a fire broke out in the Hotel Pathfinder in Fremont, Nebraska, killing 20 people. The fire was fueled by a natural gas leak at the hotel, which caused an explosion that blew out the windows of the hotel and shattered glass as far as nine blocks away. A flight instructor and a student pilot flying over the city at the time experienced severe turbulence. Stratford Hotel In January 1977, a fire broke out in the Stratford Hotel in Breckenridge, Minnesota, killing 17 people. Wenonah Park Hotel In December 1977, a fire broke out in the Wenonah Hotel in Bay City, Michigan, killing 10 people. Coates House Hotel On January 28, 1978, a fire broke out in the six-story Coates House Hotel at 1005 Broadway in Downtown Kansas City, Missouri, killing 20 people and injuring at least six. It is the worst fire disaster in the history of Kansas City. The Coates House was a former luxury hotel, and the building dated to 1886 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, but it had become a single room occupancy hotel mainly housing the poor and elderly. The fire broke out around 4 am and the Kansas City, Missouri Fire department was alerted at 4:12 am by the desk clerk. The station of the first companies due at the scene was only 100 feet down an alley to the southeast of the hotel, yet they saw no smoke or fire when they arrived about two minutes later. Other companies arriving from the south on Broadway saw smoke coming from a few upper-story windows of the hotel. A second alarm was requested at 4:17 am, and ultimately the fire went to four alarms and at its height 23 fire trucks and at least 90 firemen were on the scene, more than three-quarters of all available on-duty Kansas City fire companies, including companies from Kansas City, Kansas. It took more than four hours to bring under control. At one point the aerial ladder of one company's truck, which was more than 25 years old, froze barely a dozen feet in the air. At least five of the fire's fatalities were people who jumped from the upper stories. More than 100 survivors were taken by bus to the downtown Salvation Army Center. The hotel was gutted and the southern wing destroyed. Allen Motor Inn On November 5, 1978, a fire broke out in the Allen Motor Inn in Honesdale, Pennsylvania, killing 12 people and injuring five. The hotel had been the first concrete building in the state when it was built in 1858. Arson was suspected; there had been two other fires at the building in the previous two months. Frederick Weiler Blady, a 36-year-old drifter from New Jersey, was arrested and charged with arson in connection with this fire and with a previous fire at the same hotel on October 5, 1978. Blady was convicted of starting the October fire, but was found not guilty of the fatal November fire. Holiday Inn (Greece, New York) A fire broke out on November 26, 1978, at the Holiday Inn- Northwest in the Town of Greece, near Rochester, New York, and killed 10 people. Seven of the fatalities were Canadian; more than 130 Canadians were staying in the hotel at the time on a holiday shopping trip. The fire started on the first floor between the north and west wings of the hotel around 2:30 am. Cleaning supplies and paper products were stored in a closet near the fire's point of origin. Because of fire doors being left open and the nearby combustible materials, the fire spread very rapidly. The fire alarm system was not tied to the local fire department, and although some people reported a bell ringing, they failed to realize it was the emergency alarm bell. The fire was reported to the fire department at 2:38 am by Harold Phillips, an off-duty firefighter who was passing by. Initially the police did not consider the fire suspicious, but was officially ruled arson after an expert fire investigator brought in from New York City discovered that an uncommon and highly flammable chemical had been used to ignite it. No one was ever charged with the crime; in 2015 suspicions were raised that Phillips himself, who had since become the town's fire chief, might have set the fire. Holiday Inn (Cambridge, Ohio) On July 31, 1979, a fire broke out in the Holiday Inn in Cambridge, Ohio, killing 10 people and injuring 82. An arsonist, Gerald Willey of Randolph, Ohio, had poured gasoline on the carpet on the first floor of the two-story roadside motel and set it on fire with a lighted match. Willey was later convicted of one count of aggravated arson and 10 counts of involuntary manslaughter, and was sentenced to 14-to-50 years at Mansfield Reformatory. However, a well-known Cincinnati lawyer named Stanley Chesley held the motel responsible, arguing that the people on the second floor of the motel died from choking by toxic smoke and not by fire and that they were unable to escape because the floor-to-ceiling windows at the back of each room were not designed to be opened and had therefore trapped them. The liability case was settled out of court for US$6 million. 1980s MGM Grand Hotel The MGM Grand seen from Caesars Palace On November 21, 1980, a fire broke out in the MGM Grand Hotel (now Bally's Las Vegas) in Paradise, Nevada, killing 85 people, most through smoke inhalation. It remains the worst disaster in Nevada history, and the third-worst hotel fire in modern U.S. history. At the time of the fire, approximately 5,000 people were in the hotel and casino, a 26-story luxury resort with more than 2,000 hotel rooms. Just after 7:00 on the morning of November 21, 1980, a fire broke out in a restaurant known as The Deli. The Clark County Fire Department was the first agency to respond. Other agencies that responded included the North Las Vegas Fire Department, Las Vegas Fire & Rescue and the Henderson Fire Department. Smoke and fire spread through the building, killing 85 people and injuring 650, including guests, employees and 14 firefighters. While the fire primarily damaged the second floor casino and adjacent restaurants, most of the deaths were on the upper floors of the hotel, and were caused by smoke inhalation. Openings in vertical shafts (elevators and stairwells) and seismic joints allowed toxic smoke to spread to the top floor. The disaster led to the general publicizing of the fact that during a building fire, smoke inhalation is a more serious threat than flames. 75 people died from smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning and 4 from smoke inhalation alone; only 4 people died as a result of burns. On February 10, 1981, 90 days after the MGM fire, a smaller fire broke out at the Las Vegas Hilton. Because of the two incidents, there was a major reformation of state fire safety guidelines and codes. Stouffer's Inn of Westchester On December 4, 1980, a fire broke out at the Stouffer's Inn of Westchester, a newly built hotel and conference center in Purchase, New York, killing 26 people. The fire started in the two-level conference center of the hotel, adjacent to the four-story, 365-room hotel tower. It spread rapidly because of a lack of sufficient sprinklers and the use of highly flammable carpeting and wall coverings; New York had no statewide fire code at the time. Together with the MGM Grand fire, the Stouffer's Inn fire led to the adoption of stricter fire codes on the state and national levels. The fire was said to be a deliberate act but no one was convicted of causing it. The coffee waiter who was the chief suspect was arrested and initially convicted by the jury, but was later released by the judge for lack of evidence. The hotel reopened on April 4, 1981, four months after the fire. It today operates as the Renaissance Westchester Hotel. Westchase Hilton Hotel In March 1982, a fire broke out in the Westchase Hilton Hotel in Houston, Texas. 12 people died in the hotel, which was opened in 1980. A report by the National Fire Protection Association identified one reason for the deaths as inadequate escape routes: the stairways were located at the end of the corridor, so that as the hallways filled with smoke, people were unable to reach them and suffocated. In addition, a staff member repeatedly reset the alarm system, preventing transmission of information about the fire to the Fire Department, and a poorly closing door allowed smoke to spread. The fire was caused by a smoldering cigarette that had been dropped on a chair in a room on the fourth floor. Alexander Hamilton Hotel An arson fire burned the Alexander Hamilton Hotel in Paterson, New Jersey, on October 18, 1984, killing 15 and injuring 60 others. A resident of the hotel, Russell William Conklin, was convicted of arson and manslaughter and sentenced to 20 years in prison; he served 12 years before being released in 1997. Dupont Plaza Dupont Plaza Hotel Rescue by Phyllis Gottschalk Fire broke out in the Dupont Plaza Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on New Year's Eve 1986, killing 98 people and injuring 140. It was described as one of the worst such fires of the century. The National Fire Protection Association conducted the inquiry into the causes of the fire, in association with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Puerto Rican authorities. It was established that the fire originated in a deliberate act of arson; three people were convicted for this. The inquiry report found that fire spread from new furniture temporarily stacked in a ballroom of size 5.5√ó9.4√ó1.8 m; the furniture consisted of dressers made of wood and particle board, mattresses and sofa beds, packed in cartons. The fire originated in this room and quickly engulfed the casino and the lobby; smoke spread from the two-story lobby to other floors, and flames spread over an area of 437 m¬≤. Most bodies were charred beyond recognition; 84 charred bodies were found in the casino, five in the lobby area, three in an elevator and one in a guest room on the west side of the hotel. National TV networks gave live coverage of the fire and the rescue operations undertaken by Puerto Rican firefighters, using helicopter services and rescuing people from the roof of the hotel. 2000s Mizpah Hotel On October 31, 2006, a fire in the 84-year-old Mizpah Hotel in Reno, Nevada, killed 12 people. Casino cook Valerie Moore was convicted of setting the fire and sentenced to 12 consecutive life prison terms without parole.

Originally built by a church parish, it became a non-profit organization in 1983, and hosts appearances of local, national, and international artists as well as community events The center also houses a small museum dedicated to the craft of embroidery, gallery spaces, and supports programs offering classes in the performing and visual arts. The nation's longest running passion play production is performed annually at the center's main stage. The programming is often reflective of the cultural ties and influences of North Hudson County's Hispanic population. History The Park Theater was built 1931 as an extension of the Holy Family Church complex by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark, under the guidance of Msgr. Joseph Grieff, reputed to have a taste for theater. Under his watch the German Catholic parish had originally built the church in 1887, which at the time was the only stone parish church between Jersey City and Fort Lee along the crest of the Hudson Palisades. The neo-Gothic building houses ornate stained glass pieces which were attributed to Innsbruck Art Glass Studio of Austria and were completely restored in 2008. The year after its completion the cornerstone was laid for the parish's new school, which housed a public hall, auditorium and dressing rooms. The Park is one of few remaining of the early big theaters that once dotted the North Jersey theater landscape still in operation, as are Newark Symphony Hall and Loew's Jersey Theater. The centerpiece is its vaulted 1,400-seat proscenium theater, built in the atmospheric style. The three- manual, twenty-rank orchestral M√∂ller organ includes two pipe chambers containing 1,390 pipes plus a 25-note chime and a 61-note Deagan Harp. After years of disuse, it was restored in 1991 and is now well-maintained. The complex also contains a small black box theater, exhibition spaces, classrooms and rehearsal auditorium. To the dismay of some, the marquee was replaced in 2010, citing irreparable damage, though portions have been incorporated into its replacement. The Performing Arts Center was established in 1983 with the creation of a non-profit organization. While the building is still owned by the archdiocese, there is a long-term lease with the non-profit. The arts center was originally run by the initiator of the project, Kevin Ashe, pastor of Holy Family at the time, who felt the resource in the community was being underused. In 1991, it began operating as a full-time arts organization. When later there was a controversy with funding denial by the New Jersey State Council on the Arts, some claimed that there was a conflict with concept of separation between church and state. Nonetheless, the organization does receive some council funding for education and staff. Art for the Park is an annual fundraiser that includes exhibitions and performances. While the church and rectory are listed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places, the theater and other buildings are not. In 2019, the theater in its annual list of the 10 most endangered historic places in the state, due to the rapid deterioration of the building, which aside from a few tenants who live on the upper floor where converted classrooms were located, is mostly unused. The Archdiocese of Newark, which owns the property, expressed the possibility of selling it, provided it be to an organization willing to restore building and convert it into a viable entertainment venue similar to Loew's Jersey Theatre in Jersey City. By the late 2010s, the Theatre had fallen into disuse and required restoration. A refurbishment project headed by John Lant was completed in 2020, with the intention of the renewing the Center's status as an active venue for the arts. On March 6 - 8 of that year, a grand re-opening of the Park Art Gallery, an open house featuring live musical performances and tours of the theatre, a sneak preview of the refurbishment initiative, and a ribbon cutting ceremony held on March 7.\\"The Historic Park Theatre In Union City to Hold Open House And Ribbon Cutting; Performers Announced\\".

At the turn of the 20th century, much of North Hudson, New Jersey was populated by German-speaking immigrants who had established Catholic parishes, and by the mid-1910s two of the churches had begun annual presentations of a passion play, which sometimes led to friendly rivalry.Romano, Jay. \\"2 Passion Plays Thrive On a 'Friendly Rivalry'\\". \\"Union City Journal\\". The New York Times. March 5, 1989 Similar to the German version, the production were made possible by volunteers of the extended community. One production was sponsored by St Joseph's Church on Central Avenue in what was then West Hoboken (now the southern half of Union City). It was called \\"Veronica's Veil\\", in reference to the Veil of Veronica, and one of the stations of the cross. Opening in 1915, this production was billed as America's Passion Play, and ran until 1999. The other production was created under the auspices of Holy Family in what was then Union Hill (the northern half of town) and has been presented annually since 1915, making it the longest-running passion play in the United States. The show has been presented at the Park since it was completed, leading to the nickname America's Oberammergau. While some consider passion plays to have been historically anti-semitic, the Park's production has adapted to modern times. The 1997 show caused a stir when a black actor, Desi Arnaz Giles, was cast to play the part of Jesus Christ, sharing the role with a production veteran. This led to derogatory phone calls to the theater, a death threat left on an answering machine, and subsequently, cancellations by five tour groups. The theater also received hundreds of calls and faxes from around the world expressing support, ticket sales improved by 20%, his performance garnered a standing ovation, Stories on the Passion Play controversy at passionplayusa.net and Giles played the role the following season. The Cultural Thread/El Hilo Vitrine display of work produced in the Embroidery Capital of the United States The Cultural Thread/El Hilo is an exhibition about the craft of embroidery and lace-making. The towns in North Hudson and nearby communities such as Fairview have, since the turn of the 20th century, been the center of the industry, the Embroidery Capital of the United States, producing more than 70% of US output. Originally introduced by German and Swiss immigrants who imported the craft from their homelands, the industry expanded after the introduction of the Schiffli machine by Reiner and Sons in Weehawken in 1902.

This article covers his early life and career, through his writing the Declaration of Independence, participation in the American Revolutionary War, serving as governor of Virginia, and election and service as Vice-President to President John Adams. Born into the planter class of Virginia, Jefferson was highly educated and valued his years at the College of William and Mary. He became an attorney and planter, building on the estate and 20‚Äì40 slaves inherited from his father. Jeffersons of Virginia His father was Peter Jefferson, a planter, slaveholder, and surveyor in Albemarle County (Shadwell, Virginia).Thomas Jefferson Encyclopedia ‚Äì Welsh Ancestry . Retrieved June 2, 2010. When Colonel William Randolph, an old friend of Peter Jefferson, died in 1745, Peter assumed executorship and personal charge of Randolph's estate in Tuckahoe as well as his infant son, Thomas Mann Randolph. That year the Jeffersons relocated to Tuckahoe, where they lived for the next seven years before returning to their home in Albemarle in 1752. Peter Jefferson was appointed to the colonelcy of the county, an important position at the time.Henry Stephens Randall, The Life of Thomas Jefferson After he died in 1757, his son Thomas Jefferson inherited his estate, including about 20-40 slaves. They comprised the core of his labor force when he started to build Monticello as a young man. Thomas's paternal grandfather and great-grandfather were also named Thomas. His grandfather, Thomas Jefferson (1677-1731) resided at a settlement called Osbornes in what is now Chesterfield County, Virginia. Jefferson's great grandfather was a planter of Henrico County and his wife was Mary Branch. Mary was the granddaughter of Christopher Branch, a member of the House of Burgesses. Thomas was a tobacco farmer who owned a couple slaves, surveyor, and \\"gentleman justice\\". He purchased land along James River in 1682 and lived in the Flowerdieu, also Flowerdew Hundred of Henrico County. Thomas' grandfather died in 1697. There is conflicting information about Jefferson's heritage and specifically the parents of Thomas' great grandfather. There are also unproven allegations that were made about Jefferson's heritage during an 18th-century Presidential campaign. Within a few generations, the Jeffersons rose from that of a middling planter who struggled against low tobaccos prices beginning in the 1680s to that of the country elite and to the very pinnacle of society. The plantation-based economy of the Jeffersons and their peers relied on acquisition of slaves from West Africa and West Central Africa, primarily from the Bight of Biafra and Angola. In 1784, Jefferson published Notes on the State of Virginia where he stated that enslaved individuals made up to a third to a half of the inhabitants of most Piedmont counties of Virginia. Thomas Jefferson was born on April 13, 1743 (April 2, 1743 O.S.) at the family home in Shadwell, Goochland County, Virginia, now part of Albemarle County. His mother was Jane Randolph, daughter of Isham Randolph, a ship's captain and sometime planter, and his wife. Peter and Jane married in 1739. Thomas Jefferson had appeared to have little interest in and indifference to his ancestry; he stated that he only knew that his paternal grandfather lived. Before the widower William Randolph, an old friend of Peter Jefferson, died in 1745, he appointed Peter as guardian to manage his Tuckahoe Plantation and care for his four children. That year the Jeffersons relocated to Tuckahoe, where they lived for the next seven years before returning to Shadwell in 1752. Here Thomas Jefferson recorded his earliest memory, that of being carried on a pillow by a slave during the move to Tuckahoe. Peter Jefferson died in 1757 and the Jefferson estate was divided between Peter's two sons; Thomas and Randolph. Thomas inherited approximately of land, including Monticello and between 20‚Äì40 slaves. He took control of the property after he came of age at 21. The actual amount of land and slaves that Jefferson inherited is estimated. The first known record Jefferson made in regards to slave ownership, was in 1774, when he owned 41. On October 1, 1765, when Jefferson was 22, his oldest sister Jane died at the age of 25.Henry Stephens Randall, The Life of Thomas Jefferson. p. 41 He fell into a period of deep mourning, as he was already saddened by the absence of his sisters Mary, who had been married several years to John Bolling III,Virginia Historical Society \\"The Virginia magazine of history and biography\\". P. 331 and Martha, who in July had wed Dabney Carr. Both lived at their husbands' residences. Only Jefferson's younger siblings Elizabeth, Lucy, and the two toddlers, were at home. He drew little comfort from the younger ones, as they did not provide him with the same intellectual engagement as the older sisters had. According to the historian Ferling, while growing up Jefferson struggled with loneliness and abandonment issues that eventually developed into a reclusive lifestyle as an adult. Education Jefferson began his childhood education under the direction of tutors at Tuckahoe along with the Randolph children. In 1752, Jefferson began attending a local school run by a Scottish Presbyterian minister. At the age of nine, Jefferson began studying Latin, Greek, and French; he learned to ride horses, and began to appreciate the study of nature. He studied under the Reverend James Maury from 1758 to 1760 near Gordonsville, Virginia. While boarding with Maury's family, he studied history, science and the classics. At age 16, Jefferson entered the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, and first met the law professor George Wythe, who became his influential mentor. For two years he studied mathematics, metaphysics, and philosophy under Professor William Small, who introduced the enthusiastic Jefferson to the writings of the British Empiricists, including John Locke, Francis Bacon, and Isaac Newton.Peterson, Merrill D. ed. Thomas Jefferson: Writings. New York: Library of America, p. 1236. He also improved his French, Greek, and violin. A diligent student, Jefferson displayed an avid curiosity in all fieldsThomas Jefferson on Wine by John Hailman, 2006 and graduated in 1762 with highest honors. Jefferson read law while working as a law clerk for Wythe. During this time, he also read a wide variety of English classics and political works. Jefferson was admitted to the Virginia bar five years later in 1767. Throughout his life, Jefferson depended on books for his education. He collected and accumulated thousands of books for his library at Monticello. When Jefferson's father Peter died Thomas inherited, among other things, his large library. A significant portion of Jefferson's library was also bequeathed to him in the will of George Wythe, who had an extensive collection. Always eager for more knowledge, Jefferson continued learning throughout most of his life. Jefferson once said, \\"I cannot live without books.\\" Marriage and family After practicing as a circuit lawyer for several years, Jefferson married the 23-year-old widow Martha Wayles Skelton. The wedding was celebrated on January 1, 1772 at Martha's home, an estate called 'The Forest' near Williamsburg, Virginia. Martha Jefferson was described as attractive, gracious and popular with their friends; she was a frequent hostess for Jefferson and managed the large household. They were said to have a happy marriage. She read widely, did fine needle work and was an amateur musician. Jefferson played the violin and Martha was an accomplished piano player. It is said that she was attracted to Thomas largely because of their mutual love of music. One of the wedding gifts he gave to Martha was a \\"forte-piano\\". During the ten years of their marriage, she had six children: Martha Washington, called Patsy, (1772‚Äì1836); Jane (1774‚Äì1775); a stillborn or unnamed son in 1777; Mary Wayles (1778‚Äì1804), called Polly; Lucy Elizabeth (1780‚Äì1781); and Lucy Elizabeth (1782‚Äì1784). Two survived to adulthood. After her father John Wayles died in 1773, Martha and her husband Jefferson inherited his 135 slaves, 11,000 acres and the debts of his estate. These took Jefferson and other co-executors of the estate years to pay off, which contributed to his financial problems. Among the slaves were Betty Hemings and her 10 children; the six youngest were half-siblings of Martha Wayles Jefferson, as they are believed to have been children of her father, and they were three-quarters European in ancestry. The youngest, an infant, was Sally Hemings. As they grew and were trained, all the Hemings family members were assigned to privileged positions among the slaves at Monticello, as domestic servants, chefs, and highly skilled artisans.\\"Betty Hemings\\", Plantation and slavery, Monticello Later in life, Martha Jefferson suffered from diabetes and ill health, and frequent childbirth further weakened her. A few months after the birth of her last child, Martha died on September 6, 1782. Jefferson was at his wife's bedside and was distraught after her death. In the following three weeks, Jefferson shut himself in his room, where he paced back and forth until he was nearly exhausted. Later he would often take long rides on secluded roads to mourn for his wife. As he had promised his wife, Jefferson never remarried. Jefferson's oldest daughter Martha (called Patsy) married Thomas Mann Randolph, Jr. in 1790. They had 12 children, eleven of whom survived to adulthood. She suffered severe problems as Randolph became alcoholic and was abusive. When they separated for several years, Martha and her many children lived at Monticello with her father, adding to his financial burdens. Her oldest son, Thomas Jefferson Randolph, helped her run Monticello for a time after her father's death. She had the longest life of Jefferson's children by Martha. Mary Jefferson (called Polly and Maria) married her first cousin John Wayles Eppes in 1797. As a wedding settlement, Jefferson gave them Betsy Hemmings, the 14-year-old granddaughter of Betty Hemings, and 30 other slaves. The Eppes had three children together, but only a son survived. Frail like her mother, Maria died at the age of 25, several months after her third child was born. Who also died, and only her son Francis W. Eppes survived to adulthood, cared for by slaves, his father and, after five years, a stepmother.\\"Betsy Hemmings: Loved by a Family, But What of Her Own?\\", Keeping Families Together, Monticello, accessed January 8, 2012Annette Gordon-Reed, The Hemingses of Monticello, Hemings Family Tree-1, frontispiece, 2008. Note: Eppes and Betsy Hemmings had a son Joseph and daughter Frances. Monticello West lawn in October 2010 In 1768, Jefferson started the construction of Monticello located on 5,000 acres of land on and around a hilltop. What would soon become a mansion started as a large one room brick house. Over the years Jefferson designed and built additions to the house where it took on neoclassical dimensions. The house soon become his architectural masterpiece. The construction was done by Jefferson and his slave laborers, some of whom were master carpenters. Much of the fine furniture in the house was built by his slaves, who were also very skilled designers and craftsmen. Jefferson moved into the South Pavilion (an outbuilding) in 1770, where his new wife Martha joined him in 1772. Monticello would be his continuing project to create a neoclassical environment, based on his study of the architect Andrea Palladio and the classical orders. While Minister to France during 1784‚Äì1789, he had an opportunity to see some of the classical buildings with which he had become acquainted from his reading, as well as to discover the \\"modern\\" trends in French architecture then fashionable in Paris. In 1794, following his service as Secretary of State (1790‚Äì93), he began rebuilding Monticello based on the ideas he had acquired in Europe. The remodeling continued throughout most of his presidency (1801‚Äì09). The most notable change was the addition of the octagonal dome. Lawyer and House of Burgesses Jefferson handled many cases as a lawyer in colonial Virginia, and was very active from 1768 to 1773.Henry Stephens Randall, The Life of Thomas Jefferson. p 47 Jefferson's client list included members of Virginia's elite families, including members of his mother's family, the Randolphs. Beside practicing law, Jefferson represented Albemarle County in the Virginia House of Burgesses His friend and mentor George Wythe served at the same time. Following the passage of the Coercive Acts by the British Parliament in 1774, Jefferson wrote a set of resolutions against the acts, which were expanded into A Summary View of the Rights of British America, his first published work. Previous criticism of the Coercive Acts had focused on legal and constitutional issues, but Jefferson offered the radical notion that the colonists had the natural right to govern themselves.Merrill D. Peterson, \\"Jefferson, Thomas\\"; American National Biography Online, February 2000. Jefferson argued that Parliament was the legislature of Great Britain only, and had no legislative authority in the colonies. The paper was intended to serve as instructions for the Virginia delegation of the First Continental Congress, but Jefferson's ideas proved to be too radical for that body. Political career from 1775 to 1800 Declaration of Independence In alt=About 50 men, most of them seated, are in a large meeting room. Most are focused on the five men standing in the center of the room. : Thomas Jefferson was the principal author of the Declaration of Independence, a formal document which officially proclaimed the dissolution of the American colonies from the British Crown. The sentiments of revolution put forth in the Declaration were already well established in 1776 as the colonies were already at war with the British when the Declaration was being debated, drafted and signed. Before the Declaration was drafted, Jefferson served as a delegate from Virginia to the Second Continental Congress beginning in June 1775, soon after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. He sought out John Adams who, along with his cousin Samuel, had emerged as a leader of the convention. Jefferson and Adams established a lifelong friendship and would correspond frequently; Adams ensured that Jefferson was appointed to the five-man committee to write a declaration in support of the resolution of independence.; Having agreed on an approach, the committee selected Jefferson to write the first draft. His eloquent writing style made him the committee's choice for primary author; the others edited his draft. During June 1776, the month before the signing, Jefferson took notes of the Congressional debates over the proposed Declaration in order to include such sentiments in his draft, among other things justifying the right of citizens to resort to revolution. Jefferson also drew from his proposed draft of the Virginia Constitution, George Mason's draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, and other sources. The historian Joseph Ellis states that the Declaration was the \\"core of [Jefferson]'s seductive appeal across the ages\\". After working for two days to modify the document, Congress removed language that was deemed antagonistic to friends in Britain and Jefferson's clause that indicted the British monarchy for imposing African slavery on the colonies. This was the longest clause removed. Congress trimmed the draft by about one fourth, wanting the Declaration to appeal to the population in Great Britain as well as the soon to be United States, while at the same time not wanting to give South Carolina and Georgia reasons to oppose the Declaration on abolitionist grounds. Jefferson deeply resented some of the many omissions Congress made. On July 4, 1776, Congress ratified the Declaration of Independence and distributed the document. Historians have considered it to be one of Jefferson's major achievements; the preamble is considered an enduring statement of human rights that has inspired people around the world. Its second sentence is the following: > We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, > that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that > among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. This has been called \\"one of the best-known sentences in the English language\\",Stephen E. Lucas, \\"Justifying America: The Declaration of Independence as a Rhetorical Document\\", in Thomas W. Benson, ed., American Rhetoric: Context and Criticism, Carbondale, Illinois: Southern Illinois University Press, 1989, p. 85 containing \\"the most potent and consequential words in American history\\". The passage came to represent a moral standard to which the United States should strive. This view was notably promoted by Abraham Lincoln, who based his philosophy on it, and argued for the Declaration as a statement of principles through which the United States Constitution should be interpreted.McPherson, Second American Revolution, 126. Intended also as a revolutionary document for the world, not just the colonies, the Declaration of Independence was Jefferson's assertion of his core beliefs in a republican form of government. The Declaration became the core document and a tradition in American political values. It also became the model of democracy that was adopted by many peoples around the world. Abraham Lincoln once referred to Jefferson's principles as \\"..the definitions and axioms of a free society..\\". Virginia state legislator and Governor After Independence, Jefferson desired to reform the Virginia government. In September 1776, eager to work on creating the new government and dismantle the feudal aspects of the old, Jefferson returned to Virginia and was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates for Albemarle County. Before his return, he had contributed to the state's constitution from Philadelphia; he continued to support freehold suffrage, by which only property holders could vote. He served as a Delegate from September 26, 1776 ‚Äì June 1, 1779, as the war continued. Jefferson worked on Revision of Laws to reflect Virginia's new status as a democratic state. By abolishing primogeniture, establishing freedom of religion, and providing for general education, he hoped to make the basis of \\"republican government.\\" Ending the Anglican Church as the state (or established) religion was the first step. Jefferson introduced his \\"Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom\\" in 1779, but it was not enacted until 1786, while he was in France as US Minister. In 1778 Jefferson supported a bill to prohibit the international slave trade in Virginia; the state was the first in the union to adopt such legislation. This was significant as the slave trade would be protected from regulation for 20 years at the federal level under the new Constitution in 1787. Abolitionists in Virginia expected the new law to be followed by gradual emancipation, as Jefferson had supported this by opinion, but he discouraged such action while in the Assembly. Following his departure, the Assembly passed a law in 1782 making manumission easier. As a result, the number of free blacks in Virginia rose markedly by 1810: from 1800 in 1782 to 12,766 in 1790, and to 30,570 by 1810, when they formed 8.2 percent of the black population in the state. He drafted 126 bills in three years, including laws to establish fee simple tenure in land, which removed inheritance strictures and to streamline the judicial system. In 1778, Jefferson's \\"Bill for the More General Diffusion of Knowledge\\" and subsequent efforts to reduce control by clergy led to some small changes at William and Mary College, but free public education was not established until the late nineteenth century after the Civil War. Jefferson proposed a bill to eliminate capital punishment in Virginia for all crimes except murder and treason, but his effort was defeated. In 1779, at Jefferson's behest, William and Mary appointed his mentor George Wythe as the first professor of law at an American university. In 1779, at the age of thirty-six, Jefferson was elected Governor of Virginia by the two houses of the legislature, as was the process.Leonard Liggio, \\"The Life and Works of Thomas Jefferson\\" , The Locke Luminary Vol. II, No. 1 (Summer 1999) Part 3, George Mason University, accessed January 10, 2012 The term was then for one year, and he was re-elected in 1780. As governor in 1780, he transferred the state capital from Williamsburg to Richmond. He served as a wartime governor, as the united colonies continued the Revolutionary War against Great Britain. In late 1780, Governor Jefferson prepared Richmond for attack by moving all arms, military supplies and records to a foundry located five miles outside of town. General Benedict Arnold, who had switched to the British side in 1780, learned of the transfer and moved to capture the foundry. Jefferson tried to get the supplies moved to Westham, seven miles to the north, but he was too late. He also delayed too long in raising a militia. With the Assembly, Jefferson evacuated the government in January 1781 from Richmond to Charlottesville. They began to meet at his home of Monticello. The government had moved so rapidly that he left his household slaves in Richmond, where they were captured as prisoners of war by the British and later exchanged for soldiers. In January 1781, Benedict Arnold led an armada of British ships and, with 1600 British regulars, conducted raids along the James River. Later Arnold would join Lord Cornwallis, whose troops were marching across Virginia from the south. In early June 1781, Cornwallis dispatched a 250-man cavalry force commanded by Banastre Tarleton on a secret expedition to capture Governor Jefferson and members of the Assembly at Monticello. Tarleton hoped to surprise Jefferson, but Jack Jouett, a captain in the Virginia militia, thwarted the British plan by warning the governor and members of the Assembly. Jefferson and his family escaped and fled to Poplar Forest, his plantation to the west. Tarleton did not allow looting or destruction at Monticello by his troops. By contrast, when Lord Cornwallis and his sizeable number of troops later occupied Elkhill, a smaller estate of Jefferson's on the James River in Goochland County, they stripped it of resources and left it in ruins. According to a letter by Jefferson about Elkhill, British troops destroyed all his crops, burned his barns and fences, slaughtered or drove off the livestock, seized usable horses, cut the throats of foals and, after setting fires, left the plantation a waste. They captured 27 slaves and held them as prisoners of war. At least 24 died in the camp of diseases,Places: \\"Elkhill\\", Thomas Jefferson Encyclopedia, Monticello, accessed January 10, 2012 a chronic problem for prisoners and troops in an era of poor sanitation. Jefferson believed his gubernatorial term had expired in June, and he spent much of the summer with his family at Poplar Forest. The members of the General Assembly had quickly reconvened in June 1781 in Staunton, Virginia across the Blue Ridge Mountains. They voted to reward Jouett with a pair of pistols and a sword, but considered an official inquiry into Jefferson's actions, as they believed he had failed his responsibilities as governor. > The inquiry ultimately was dropped, yet Jefferson insisted on appearing > before the lawmakers in December to respond to charges of mishandling his > duties and abandoning leadership at a critical moment. He reported that he > had believed it understood that he was leaving office and that he had > discussed with other legislators the advantages of Gen.

(The legislature did appoint Nelson as governor in late June 1781.) > Jefferson was a controversial figure at this time, heavily criticized for > inaction and failure to adequately protect the state in the face of a > British invasion. Even on balance, Jefferson had failed as a state > executive, leaving his successor, Thomas Nelson, Jr. to pick up the pieces. He was not re-elected again to office in Virginia. Notes on the State of Virginia In 1780 Jefferson as governor received numerous questions about Virginia, posed to him by Fran√ßois Barb√©-Marbois, then Secretary of the French delegation in Philadelphia, the temporary capital of the united colonies, who intended to gather pertinent data on the American colonies. Jefferson's responses to Marbois' \\"Queries\\" would become known as Notes on the State of Virginia (1785). Scientifically trained, Jefferson was a member of the American Philosophical Society, which had been founded in Philadelphia in 1743. He had extensive knowledge of western lands from Virginia to Illinois. In a course of five years, Jefferson enthusiastically devoted his intellectual energy to the book; he included a discussion of contemporary scientific knowledge, and Virginia's history, politics, and ethnography. Jefferson was aided by Thomas Walker, George R. Clark, and U.S. geographer Thomas Hutchins. The book was first published in France in 1785 and in England in 1787.Shuffelton (1999, June 2001), Notes on the State of Virginia Thomas Jefferson, Introduction It has been ranked as the most important American book published before 1800. The book is Jefferson's vigorous and often eloquent argument about the nature of the good society, which he believed was incarnated by Virginia. In it he expressed his beliefs in the separation of church and state, constitutional government, checks and balances, and individual liberty. He also compiled extensive data about the state's natural resources and economy. He wrote extensively about the problems of slavery, miscegenation, and his belief that blacks and whites could not live together as free people in one society. Member of Congress and Minister to France Following its victory in the war and peace treaty with Great Britain, in 1783 the United States formed a Congress of the Confederation (informally called the Continental Congress), to which Jefferson was appointed as a Virginia delegate. As a member of the committee formed to set foreign exchange rates, he recommended that American currency should be based on the decimal system; his plan was adopted. Jefferson also recommended setting up the Committee of the States, to function as the executive arm of Congress. The plan was adopted but failed in practice. Jefferson was \\"one of the first statesmen in any part of the world to advocate concrete measures for restricting and eradicating Negro slavery.\\"David Brion Davis, The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution: 1770‚Äì1823, 1975, p. 174 Jefferson wrote an ordinance banning slavery in all the nation's territories (not just the Northwest), but it failed by one vote. The subsequent Northwest Ordinance prohibited slavery in the newly organized territory, but it did nothing to free slaves who were already held by settlers there; this required later actions. Jefferson was in France when the Northwest Ordinance was passed. He resigned from Congress when he was appointed as minister to France in May 1784. alt=Memorial plaque on the Champs-√âlys√©es, Paris, France, marking where Jefferson lived while he was Minister to France.

When the French foreign minister, the Count de Vergennes, commented to Jefferson, \\"You replace Monsieur Franklin, I hear,\\" Jefferson replied, \\"I succeed him. No man can replace him.\\"Hale, 1896 p. 119 Beginning in early September 1785, Jefferson collaborated with John Adams, US minister in London, to outline an anti-piracy treaty with Morocco. Their work culminated in a treaty that was ratified by Congress on July 18, 1787. Still in force today, it is the longest unbroken treaty relationship in U.S. history.\\"1787 Treaty with Morocco\\", Department of State, Retrieved February 15, 2011. Busy in Paris, Jefferson did not return to the US for the 1787 Constitutional Convention. He enjoyed the architecture, arts, and the salon culture of Paris. He often dined with many of the city's most prominent people, and stocked up on wines to take back to the US.Lawrence S. Kaplan, Jefferson and France: An Essay on Politics and Political Ideas, Yale University Press, 1980 While in Paris, Jefferson corresponded with many people who had important roles in the imminent French Revolution. These included the Marquis de Lafayette, and the Comte de Mirabeau, a popular pamphleteer who repeated ideals that had been the basis for the American Revolution.Antonina Vallentin, Mirabeau, trans. E. W. Dickes, The Viking Press, 1948, p. 86. His observations of social tensions contributed to his anti-clericalism and strengthened his ideas about the separation of church and state. Jefferson's eldest daughter Martha, known as Patsy, went with him to France in 1784. His two youngest daughters were in the care of friends in the United States. To serve the household, Jefferson brought some of his slaves, including James Hemings, who trained as a French chef for his master's service. Jefferson's youngest daughter Lucy died of whooping cough in 1785 in the United States, and he was bereft. In 1786, Jefferson met and fell in love with Maria Cosway, an accomplished Italian-English artist and musician of 27. They saw each other frequently over a period of six weeks. A married woman, she returned to Great Britain, but they maintained a lifelong correspondence. In 1787, Jefferson sent for his youngest surviving child, Polly, then age nine. He requested that a slave accompany Polly on the trans- Atlantic voyage. By chance, Sally Hemings, a younger sister of James, was chosen; she lived in the Jefferson household in Paris for about two years. According to her son Madison Hemings, Sally and Jefferson began a sexual relationship in Paris and she became pregnant. She agreed to return to the United States as his concubine after he promised to free her children when they came of age. Secretary of State In September 1789 Jefferson returned to the US from France with his two daughters and slaves. Immediately upon his return, President Washington wrote to him asking him to accept a seat in his Cabinet as Secretary of State. Jefferson accepted the appointment. As Washington's Secretary of State (1790‚Äì1793), Jefferson argued with Alexander Hamilton, the Secretary of the Treasury, about national fiscal policy,Pearson, Ellen Holmes. \\"Jefferson versus Hamilton.\\" Teachinghistory.org. Accessed July 14, 2011. especially the funding of the debts of the war. Jefferson later associated Hamilton and the Federalists with \\"Royalism,\\" and said the \\"Hamiltonians were panting after ... crowns, coronets and mitres.\\" Due to their opposition to Hamilton, Jefferson and James Madison founded and led the Democratic-Republican Party. He worked with Madison and his campaign manager John J. Beckley to build a nationwide network of Republican allies. Jefferson's political actions and his attempt to undermine Hamilton nearly led Washington to dismiss Jefferson from his cabinet. Although Jefferson left the cabinet voluntarily, Washington never forgave him for his actions, and never spoke to him again. The French minister said in 1793: \\"Senator Morris and Secretary of the Treasury Hamilton ... had the greatest influence over the President's mind, and that it was only with difficulty that he [Jefferson] counterbalanced their efforts.\\"Elkins, Stanley and Eric McKitrick (1995). The Age of Federalism New York: Oxford University Press, p. 344. Jefferson supported France against Britain when they fought in 1793.\\"Foreign Affairs,\\" in Peterson, ed. Thomas Jefferson: A Reference Encyclopedia (1986) p. 325 Jefferson believed that political success at home depended on the success of the French army in Europe. In 1793, the French minister Edmond-Charles Gen√™t caused a crisis when he tried to influence public opinion by appealing to the American people, something which Jefferson tried to stop. Jefferson tried to achieve three important goals during his discussions with George Hammond, British Minister to the U.S.: secure British admission of violating the Treaty of Paris (1783); vacate their posts in the Northwest (the territory between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River north of the Ohio); and compensate the United States to pay American slave owners for the slaves whom the British had freed and evacuated at the end of the war. Chester Miller notes that after failing to gain agreement on any of these, Jefferson resigned in December 1793. Election of 1796 and Vice Presidency In late 1793, Jefferson retired to Monticello, from where he continued to oppose the policies of Hamilton and Washington. The Jay Treaty of 1794, led by Hamilton, brought peace and trade with Britainwhile Madison, with strong support from Jefferson, wanted \\"to strangle the former mother country\\" without going to war.Miller (1960), pp. 143‚Äì44, 148‚Äì49. \\"It became an article of faith among Republicans that 'commercial weapons' would suffice to bring Great Britain to any terms the United States chose to dictate.\\" Even during the violence of the Reign of Terror in France, Jefferson refused to disavow the revolution because \\"To back away from France would be to undermine the cause of republicanism in America.\\"Thomas Jefferson, Jean M. Yarbrough, The Essential Jefferson, Hackett Publishing, 2006. (p. xx) As vice president, Jefferson conducted secret talks with the French, in which he advocated that the French government take a more aggressive position against the American government, which he thought was too close to the British. He succeeded in getting the American ambassador expelled from France. As the Democratic-Republican presidential candidate in 1796, Jefferson lost to John Adams, but had enough electoral votes to become Vice President (1797‚Äì1801). One of the chief duties of a Vice president is presiding over the Senate, and Jefferson was concerned about its lack of rules leaving decisions to the discretion of the presiding officer. Years before holding his first office, Jefferson had spent much time researching procedures and rules for governing bodies. As a student, he had transcribed notes on British parliamentary law into a manual which he would later call his Parliamentary Pocket Book. Jefferson had also served on the committee appointed to draw up the rules of order for the Continental Congress in 1776. As Vice President, he was ready to reform Senatorial procedures. Prompted by the immediate need, he wrote A Manual of Parliamentary Practice, a document which the House of Representatives follows to the present day. With the Quasi- War underway, the Federalists under John Adams started rebuilding the military, levied new taxes, and enacted the Alien and Sedition Acts. Jefferson believed that these acts were intended to suppress Democratic-Republicans rather than dangerous enemy aliens, although the acts were allowed to expire. Jefferson and Madison rallied opposition support by anonymously writing the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, which declared that the federal government had no right to exercise powers not specifically delegated to it by the states. Though the resolutions followed the \\"interposition\\" approach of Madison, Jefferson advocated nullification. At one point he drafted a threat for Kentucky to secede. Jefferson's biographer Dumas Malone argued that had his actions become known at the time, Jefferson might have been impeached for treason. In writing the Kentucky Resolutions, Jefferson warned that, \\"unless arrested at the threshold,\\" the Alien and Sedition Acts would \\"necessarily drive these states into revolution and blood.\\" The historian Ron Chernow says, \\"[H]e wasn't calling for peaceful protests or civil disobedience: he was calling for outright rebellion, if needed, against the federal government of which he was vice president.\\" Chernow believes that Jefferson \\"thus set forth a radical doctrine of states' rights that effectively undermined the constitution.\\" He argues that neither Jefferson nor Madison sensed that they had sponsored measures as inimical as the Alien and Sedition Acts. The historian Garry Wills argued, \\"Their nullification effort, if others had picked it up, would have been a greater threat to freedom than the misguided [alien and sedition] laws, which were soon rendered feckless by ridicule and electoral pressure.\\"Wills, Gary. \\"James Madison\\". p49 The theoretical damage of the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions was \\"deep and lasting, and was a recipe for disunion\\". George Washington was so appalled by them that he told Patrick Henry that if \\"systematically and pertinaciously pursued\\", they would \\"dissolve the union or produce coercion.\\" The influence of Jefferson's doctrine of states' rights reverberated to the Civil War and beyond.Knott. \\"Alexander Hamilton and the Persistence of Myth\\". p. 48 According to Chernow, during the Quasi-War, Jefferson engaged in a \\"secret campaign to sabotage Adams in French eyes.\\" In the spring of 1797, he held four confidential talks with the French consul Joseph Letombe. In these private meetings, Jefferson attacked Adams, predicted that he would only serve one term, and encouraged France to invade England. Jefferson advised Letombe to stall any American envoys sent to Paris by instructing them to \\"listen to them and then drag out the negotiations at length and mollify them by the urbanity of the proceedings.\\" This toughened the tone that the French government adopted with the new Adams Administration. Due to pressure against the Adams Administration from Jefferson and his supporters, Congress released the papers related to the XYZ Affair, which rallied a shift in popular opinion from Jefferson and the French government to supporting Adams.

It is distinguished by the presence of red or vermilion spots on the body along with black ones, while the nominate form O. masou masou, known as the yamame, only has black ones. The amago is distributed in western Japan, on the Pacific side of the Honshu and Shikoku islands, and on the Inland Sea of Japan side of Kyushu. The subspecies is a subject of aquaculture. It can grow up to length. There are both anadromous (sea-run) and persistently stream- dwelling populations of the amago. Previously it was considered a subspecies of Oncorhynchus rhodurus, a name that currently only refers to the Biwa trout, which has a restricted distribution within the range of the amago.Kato, F.

Georgia was pressured by Russia and the United States to repress the threats of Al-Qaeda in the Pankisi Gorge.https://www.refworld.org/docid/46a4854021.html  The ricin crisis  It was largely unknown why Abu Musab al-Zarqawi chose to move into Pankisi Gorge when he could have also struck into Chechnya, where Al-Qaeda's presence was strong. In the build-up to the Iraq War in early 2003, dozens of North Africans (mainly Algerians) were arrested in the United Kingdom, France and Spain on charges of preparing ricin and other chemical weapons. Colin Powell and others trumpeted the arrests as proof of the threat posed by the Zarqawi- Chechen-Pankisi ricin network, which has now been expanded to include the Ansar al-Islam of Kurdish northern Iraq. French and British security officials were astounded by Powell's insistence on February 12, 2003, saying that \\"the ricin that is bouncing around Europe now originated in Iraq.\\" With the Iraq invasion only weeks away, the source of the ricin threat moved from Georgia to Iraq. Sergei Ivanov reported that the Spanish suspects had been trained in the Pankisi Gorge by Al-Qaeda terrorists and even claimed that Osama Bin Laden may have been hiding somewhere in the Akhmeta Municipality.https://www.rferl.org/a/1098867.html There were also claims of several Al-Qaeda laboratories producing ricin. Those lacked any evidence however, as the production of ricin required large quantities of castor beans, which were not grown in Georgia.https://jamestown.org/program/ricin-fever-abu- musab-al-zarqawi-in-the-pankisi-gorge/  U.S.-Georgian anti-terrorist operations  On 28 April, 2002 a small Georgian anti-terror unit lead by their U.S. commander ambushed a group of insurgents. It was falsely believed that prominent mujahid leader Ibn al-Khattab was among the dead, according to allegations that Omar Mohammed Ali Al Rammah reportedly withnessed him die in that incident. This was due to his real identity remaining a mystery until after his demise. The quick and violent nature of the operation reportedly sparked fear among Chechen militants in the area, who went into hiding. By October 20, 2002, Georgia had netted about a dozen Arab militants. The Georgians and the U.S. led a serious crackdown on the militants that littered the gorge, capturing an unknown number of combatants. On September 3, 2003, President Eduard Shevardnadze said that the Georgian security forces had established full control over the gorge. Georgia sent 1,000 police officers and security troops to the region late in October, setting up checkpoints and vowing to impose order. Georgian officials also said they planned to build up the number of border troops near Chechnya and Ingushetia, another Russian republic. Russia accused Georgia of allowing Chechen fighters to raid across the border. On June 15, 2003, 15 more Chechen militants entered the area and took refuge in a two-story house. Georgian officials said that more than 30 militants were detained. France cracked down on May 14, 2004 by arresting two Algerians working with chemical and biological weapons. Georgia announced the end of the operation and withdrew its Internal Troops from the region by January 21, 2005.

The newspaper received the 1984 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for the series.

Synopsis On July 12, 1981 the Los Angeles Times published the first article in what came to be known as the \\"Marauders Series\\". Full of negative stereotypes and inflammatory language, the series depicted African Americans and Latinos as ruthless thieves who committed crimes in affluent neighborhoods and who fled via L.A.'s freeways. Mexican- American reporters organized and approached the Los Angeles Times editors with a proposed new series: in-depth feature articles on Southern California Latino life that would go beyond depictions of poverty, gangs, and crime. Their innovative story approach and produced a 27-part-story project.

Heritage Action, which has affiliates throughout the United States, is a sister organization of the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation. Heritage Action has been called a \\"powerhouse in a new generation of conservative groups\\" and \\"perhaps now the most influential lobby group among Congressional Republicans.\\" The organization has been led by executive director Jessica Anderson since April 2020. Background and history Heritage Action was first announced in April 2010 by Ed Feulner, the then president of The Heritage Foundation. He stated the purpose of the organization was to harness \\"grassroots energy to increase the pressure on Members of Congress to embrace The Heritage Foundation‚Äôs policy recommendations.\\" He also said it would not be involved in election campaigns. Heritage Action's goal was to expand the political reach of The Heritage Foundation and advance the policies recommended by its researchers. The organization was launched primarily as a response to The Heritage Foundation's growing membership, and the fact that The Heritage Foundation is not allowed to back legislation due to its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status. Heritage Action fulfills this role and provides a link between the think tank and grassroots conservative activists. Heritage Action began with a staff of ten, including original chief executive officer Michael A. Needham and Timothy Chapman. Chapman become executive director in May 2018https://heritageaction.com/press/heritage-action-names-tim-chapman- executive-director Executive Director following Needham's departure.https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press- releases?ID=E32503F9-EDDC-4E54-9AEE-ED6E0DF7F179 Chapman had previously served as Heritage Action's chief operating officer and as chief of staff to Heritage Foundation President Ed J. Feulner. Chapman left the organization in March 2020. Jessica Anderson has led the organization since 2020. Jessica Anderson first joined Heritage Action in 2010 and served as grassroots director, but left in 2017 to serve in the Office of Management and Budget in the Trump Administration. She returned to Heritage Action as vice president in 2018https://heritageaction.com/press/heritage-action-announces-new-vice- president before being named executive director in 2020. Activities Heritage Action launched its first advocacy campaign in July 2010, targeting Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), President Barack Obama's health care reform law. By August 2010 the organization had helped to secure 170 Republican co-sponsors for a petition by Rep. Steve King to force a vote on repealing the healthcare reform. Following this, in September 2010, the group began a 10-day television and web campaign to persuade Democrats to sign onto a repeal of the law. The group opened its state operations in North Carolina and Pennsylvania in January 2011, specifically to focus on mobilizing voters against the health care law. Heritage Action launched a campaign in August 2013 to link the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as the ACA or \\"Obamacare\\", with laws to keep the federal government open or to increase the federal debt limit. The organization played an instrumental role in the government shutdown of October 2013. While the shutdown was ongoing Heritage Action continued to urge lawmakers not to negotiate a measure to fully fund the government without dismantling the ACA. The strategy of Heritage Action in tying the ACA to the shutdown, according to then-CEO Michael Needham, was to make President Obama \\"feel pain\\" because of the shutdown. Senator Orrin Hatch criticized Heritage for warning legislators not to vote for the Senate budget compromise during the government shutdown. The group is also known for their congressional scorecard, which scores members of Congress on \\"votes, co-sponsorships and other legislative activity.\\" Heritage Action maintains a grassroots presence outside of D.C. with professional grassroots coordinators who recruit and train conservative \\"Sentinel\\" activists. In 2020, Heritage Action's grassroots work included door-to-door issue canvassing in Iowa, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Due to the coronavirus, some of these efforts were transitioned for a time to phone calls. In August 2020, Heritage Action launched a pro-police pledge \\"for citizens, lawmakers and candidates to stand with [the] nation‚Äôs law enforcement officers.\\" Over 100 members of Congress signed the pledge. The pledge was accompanied by the group's pro-police billboards in New York City, Dallas, and Atlanta. Funding Heritage Action is supported by individual and corporate donors, with its 2012 tax return indicating that 44 percent of its overall contributions came from donations of $5,000 or less that year. They have generally declined to disclose who their donors are.
