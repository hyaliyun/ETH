Kingston Whig-Standard, June 30, 2000. Its subject matter was wide ranging with current affairs, arts reporting, radio documentaries, and interviews. It was often quite sombre and serious in tone. However, The Sunday Edition is also listed among the 100 best April Fool's jokes of all time for its fake interview with Jimmy Carter on April 1, 2001.\\"Interview With President Carter -- April Fool's Day, 2001\\". Museum of Hoaxes. The interview, which presented Carter as a \\"washed up peanut farmer\\" but seemingly neglected to mention his status as a former President of the United States, even fooled The Globe and Mail, which reported the interview as fact on its front pages. Toronto comedian Ray Landry played the role of Carter. The program was considered a ratings hit with 1.1 million people listening to at least part of the show in a typical week. An abbreviated edition of the program was repeated at midnight on Sunday nights, with the title, The Sunday Edition: Round Midnight. Beginning in the fall of 2014, the program was cut from three hours in length to two, with the 11 am to noon slot being taken over by The 180, a current affairs show based in Western Canada. In 2017, following the cancellation of The 180, the program returned to three hours in length. In May 2020, Enright announced that he would retire from the program effective June 28, to host a new one-hour weekly program for the CBC. An abbreviated 75-minute version of The Sunday Edition aired through the summer, presented by guest hosts such as Kevin Sylvester, Laurie Brown, Anthony Germain, and Elamin Abdelmahmoud, which featured repeats of earlier interviews and segments and some new material.

After teaching in Saint Petersburg university, he left the Soviet Russia in 1921 to settle in Estonia, where he advised the government in monetary issues. He also gained the Estonian citizenship, but moved to Paris in 1925. He taught at the Institute of Political Studies in Paris and in the International Law Academy in The Hague before moving to London in 1929 to work as an expert for Equitable Life Insurance. Work for this company led him to New York, where he definitely established in 1930. After obtaining the USA nationality, he was invited to teach at Northwestern University and New York University until 1943, working as a free-lance law expert for the Justice Department until 1947. Sack is best known for his formalization of the odious debt doctrine in his work Les effets des transformations des Etats sur leurs dettes publiques et autres obligations financi√®res (Effects of the transformations of the states in their public debts and other financial obligations), published in Paris in 1927, when he taught law at the Institute of Political Studies. Alexander Sack synthetised the concept of odious debt based on precedents from the 19th century, such as the Mexican government rejection to pay debts acquired by the emperor Maximilian I, and the rejection by the USA, once annexed Cuba, to pay the debts acquired when it was a Spanish colony.

State Russian Museum, St. Petersburg, Russia. Black Circle (or motive 1915) is a 1924 oil on canvas painting by the Kiev-born Russian artist Kazimir Malevich, founder of the Russian Suprematism movement. From the mid-1910s, Malevich abandoned any trace of figurature or representation from his paintings in favour of pure abstraction. The work depicts a monumental perfect black circle floating on a flat white background. It is, along with his Black Square of 1915, one of his most well known early works in this field, depicting pure geometrical figures in primary colours.Gray, 194Farthing, 617 The motif of a black circle was displayed in December 1915 at the '0.10'pronounced 'Zero-Ten'. Exhibition in St. Petersburg along with 34 other of his abstract works.Suprematism. visual-arts-cork.com. Retrieved 15 January 2012. The exhibition coincided with the publication of his manifesto \\"From Cubism to Suprematism\\" and launched the radical Suprematism movement. Malevich described the painting, along with the similar Black Square and Black Cross (both 1915), in spiritual terms; \\"new icons\\" for the aesthetics of modern art, and believed that their clarity and simplicity reflected traditional Russian piety. In these notions, his art and ideas later chimed with those of the Bolsheviks. However, while the paintings found favour with intellectuals, they did not appeal to the general viewer and as a result Malevich lost official approval. He was later persecuted by Stalin, who had an implicit mistrust of all modern art. In his manifesto, Malevich described the paintings as \\"desperate struggle to free art from the ballast of the objective world\\" by focusing only on pure form.Blanshard, Frances Bradshaw. \\"Retreat from Likeness in the Theory of Painting\\". New York: Columbia University Press, 1949. 4 He sought to paint works that could be understood by all, but at the same time would have an emotional impact comparable to religious works. In 1990, the art critic Michael Brenson noted of the works, \\"The one constant in Malevich's Suprematism is the white ground. It is utterly selfless and anonymous yet distinct. It is a dense emptiness, or full void. It is atmospheric yet it has little air, and it does not suggest sky. It does not envelop or squeeze the rectangles, rings and lines. It is ready and available but not transparent. It is not open or closed but both at the same time. Some white shapes nestle inside it. Most shapes stick to it. Nothing is trapped. Everything seems held yet free. Shape and whiteness are different but they never struggle.\\"Brenson, Michael. \\"Malevich's Search for a New Reality\\". New York Times, 17 September 1990. Retrieved 15 January 2012. In 1924, the work, along with the Square and Cross, hung at the 14th Venice Biennale.N√©ret, 93 Malevich's work of this period went on to have a significant influence on 20th-century art, most especially on photography of the 1920s and 30s and on the op art movement of the 1960s. When Malevich died in 1934, he was buried in a coffin decorated by Nikolai Suetin with a black square at the head and a black circle at the foot.N√©ret, 94 Gallery File:Malevich.black- square.jpg|Black Square, ca. 1923, Oil on linen, State Russian Museum, Saint Petersburg File:Black Cross.jpg|Black Cross, c 1920-23, Oil on Canvas, State Russian Museum, Saint Petersburg File:Black and White.

Background to the Act The Bills of Lading Act 1855 was commendably brief and proved useful, but as time went by certain defects became apparent. The English courts devised some ways round the problem: in Brandt v Liverpool 1924 [1924] 1 KB 575Brandt v Liverpool, Brazil and River Plate Steam Navigation Co. Ltd the concept of implied contracts was developed. Nevertheless, there were difficulties relating to passing of property and passing of risk. The Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission addressed the issue in a report, \\"Rights of Suit in respect of Carriage of Goods by Sea\\".LAW COM No. 196 & SCOT LAW COM No. 130 The Report contained a draft bill which Parliament adopted in full without amendment.Except that, for obvious reasons, the proposed short title was changed from \\"Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1991 to \\" ~~~ 1992\\" The Act's provisions The statute makes provision for Bills of Lading and other documents of carriage, as follows: *s.1: The CoGSA 1992 now applies to: bills of lading, sea waybills, and ship's delivery orders. A bill of lading must be negotiable, and includes a \\"received for shipment\\" bill. *s.1 also empowers the Minister to make regulatory provision (by way of a Statutory Instrument) in respect of electronic transactions and electronic bills of lading. *s.2: A person who becomes the lawful holder of a bill of lading (or sea waybill, or delivery order) shall have transferred to and vested in him all rights of suit under the contract of carriage as if he had been a party to the contract. *s.3: Where such a person (s.2) takes or demands delivery of the goods (or makes a cargo claim), that person becomes subject to the same liabilities under that contract as if he had been a party to that contract. *s.4: A bill of lading which represents goods to have been shipped, and which is signed by the ship‚Äôs master or his agent is conclusive evidence of receipt for shipment. *(s.4 quashes the rule in Grant v Norway 1851). Bills of Lading A bill of lading serves three main functions: * it is a conclusive receipt, i.e. an acknowledgement that the goods have been loaded; * it contains or evidences the terms of the contract of carriage; and * it serves as a document of title to the goods, subject to the nemo dat quod non habet rule. Although the term \\"bill of lading\\" is well known and well understood, it may become obsolete. Articles 1:15 & 1:16 of the Rotterdam Rules create the new term \\"transport document\\"; but (assuming the Rules come into force) it remains to be seen whether shippers, carriers and \\"maritime performing parties\\" (another new Rotterdam Rules coinage) will abandon the long-established and familiar term, \\"bill of lading\\".  The Carriage of Goods By Sea Act 1971  The Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971 incorporates the Hague-Visby Rules into English Law. These rules require (where the Article X invokes the Rules) that, on demand, the carrier must provide the shipper with a bill of lading that meets the requirements of Article III.

It was written and produced by Tricky Stewart and Ester Dean. \\"Complicated\\" is a dance-pop, hip hop and trance music song, which also displays elements of pop, dance-pop and R&B.; It contains lyrical content explaining how two people in a relationship can find one another complicated at times. The song was acclaimed by critics, as the majority of reviewers concluded that it was one of the best tracks to be included on Loud. Reviewers also praised Rihanna's vocal performance in the song. Upon the release of the album in November 2010, the song charted at number 50 on the South Korea Gaon International Chart. Background and inspiration \\"Complicated\\" was written and produced by Tricky Stewart and Ester Dean, for Rihanna's fifth studio album, Loud. The song was recorded in 2010 at Westlake Recording Studios, and Larrabee Sound Studios, both located in Los Angeles, California. In an interview with Sway Calloway for MTV, Rihanna explained the meaning behind \\"Complicated\\" and how it is applicable for both men and women, saying: Composition \\"Complicated\\" is dance-pop, hip hop and trance song, which lasts for 4:17 (four minutes, 17 seconds). It also displays elements of pop, dance-pop and R&B.; Emily Mackay of NME described the song as \\"a clean, sharp dancepop number, backed by a dark and shuffling hip-hop beat.\\" According to the digital sheet music published by EMI, \\"Complicated\\" is written in the key of A minor and is set in common time with a moderate electro-ballad groove. The instrumentation of \\"Complicated\\" consists of synth beats and \\"crackling outbursts\\" of percussion and drums. It also makes use of piano keys and guitar strings. Rihanna's vocal range in the song spans from the lower note of G3 to the higher note of C5. Mackay noted that the singer adopts a \\"melancholic pop vocal\\" for the duration of the song. Chad Grischow of IGN stated that Rihanna appears to be screaming the vocals during the hook, citing the key of the \\"jittery dance beat\\" as the reason for oversinging. However, Grischow commented that the singer sounds more pleasant to listen to during the verses, writing: \\"The song actually sounds great when the light, plucky verses are quietly building to the hook, allowing her to sing rather than shout.\\" Rihanna sings about the complications of a relationship, as well as how the protagonist can experience mood swings, whereby his or her feelings frequently change toward their lover. Critical reception \\"Complicated\\" garnered critical acclaim from music critics. Colin Gentry of 4Music named the song the highlight of the album, continuing to write that Rihanna pours her heart out to the listener as she sings about the intensity of her \\"despair\\". Jon Parales of The New York Times described \\"Complicated\\" as being one of the more \\"emotional\\" songs on Loud. Emily Mackay of NME noted that the lyrics \\"Why do you make it so hard to love you?/I hate it\\" were reminiscent of songs by English pop girl group, Sugababes. Steve Jones of USA Today observed that Rihanna's opinions of men are not just present on \\"Complicated\\", but rather that it is a recurring theme on Loud, writing \\"On more than one occasion, she makes it clear that she likes her men complicated and that they can expect her to be the same.\\" Jones also listed it as one of his top songs to download from the album. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented that the \\"spiraling dance-floor siren\\" persona Rihanna adopted on the lead single from Loud, \\"Only Girl (In the World)\\", was carried through onto \\"Complicated\\". Greenblatt continued to praise Rihanna's vocal performance, writing: \\"Even while telling a recalcitrant man how hard he is to love, she sounds almost buoyant, her newly expanded vocals eager to scale the song's high-altitude house beat.\\" Nima Baniamer of Contactmusic.com praised Rihanna's vocal performance and liked it to single track from Loud, \\"California King Bed\\", writing: \\"Taking a seat back from the thumping club classics, tracks like California King Bed and Complicated are both emotional singles that reveal Rihanna's surprisingly brilliant vocals.\\" Baniamer also expressed that it would be a \\"travesty\\" if the song was not chosen as a single from the album. Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club was complimentary of the song, as well as single track \\"What's My Name?\\", writing: \\"Her bubbly patois and soaring divatronics elevate the generic R&B; and Euro-dance flavors of 'What's My Name' and 'Complicated,' respectively.\\" However, Bill Lamb of About.com was critical of the song, labeling it as \\"cluttered\\" and the album's \\"low-point\\".

The identity card identifies fans as supporters of specific teams and are checked by police or security at the stadium entry.

Flo originated from an area of convection that first formed to the southeast of the Marshall Islands on September 7\\\\. Five days later, the disturbance obtained tropical depression status, and on September 13, intensified into a tropical storm. Tracking west-northwest as it rounded a subtropical ridge, Flo slowly deepened, and on September 15, became a typhoon. After developing an eye, Flo began to rapidly intensify, and on September 17, Flo attained peak intensity. Shortly thereafter, the typhoon began to recurve to the northeast towards Honshu in response to deepening troughs to the northwest and north of the system, which resulted in a weakening trend due to increased vertical wind shear despite remaining over warm water. On September 19, Flo made landfall on southern Honshu, becoming the first typhoon to hit the Kii Peninsula in 11 years, and thereafter started to transition into an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical remnants of Flo were last noted on the morning of September 22\\\\. Typhoon Flo was the strongest system to affect Japan since 1959. For a period of three days, the typhoon dropped heavy rainfall across much of the Japanese archipelago, which inflicted damage in 44 of 47 prefectures. The typhoon also passed just east of Okinawa, coming close enough to drop heavy rainfall. There, four people were killed, four were hurt, and five vessels sunk. On the northeastern side of Shikoku Island, in Kagawa Prefecture, two people were killed, 1,748 homes were damaged, and another 116 homes were destroyed. Across the Amami Islands, 13 people were killed, 29 others were hurt, 917 homes were damaged, and an additional 446 houses were destroyed, resulting in 2,327 homeless individuals. In Okayama Prefecture on the main Japanese island of Honshu, ten people perished and nine others were injured. There, 2,810 homes were demolished, 4,675 others were damaged, and Flo was the worst typhoon to strike the prefecture since 1964. While damage in Tokyo was slight, 260,000 passengers were stranded after 117 trains along the T≈çkaid≈ç Shinkansen line were disrupted. Due to a prolonged period of heavy rain, partially caused by Flo, rainfall was 300% of normal in some locations on the island as of mid- September 1990 while sunshine time was a mere 64% of average in Hokkaido Prefecture. Overall, 40 fatalities were reported and 131 others sustained injuries. A total 16,541 houses were destroyed while 18,183 others were flooded. Additionally, 413 ships sunk and 10,365 acres (4,195 ha) of farmland were damaged. The typhoon flooded or cut roads at 418 locations and railroads at 31 spots while there were also greater than 450 landslides. A total of 337 flights were canceled by Japan's four major airlines (Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airways, Japan Air System, and Air Nippon) affecting around 33,000 passengers. Moreover, 245 trains were halted, leaving almost 300,000 stranded. Monetary damage amounted to ¬•132 billion or US$918 million across the country. Meteorological history The origins of Typhoon Flo can be traced to an area of convection that first formed to the southeast of the Marshall Islands on September 7\\\\. At 06:00 UTC the next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started tracking the system while it was located about 430 km (270 mi) east-southeast of Guam. Initially, the disturbance tracked generally west- northwest as it remained weak. Over the next four days, the storm's convective structure slowly improved caused by an expansion of its equatorial outflow channel while also turning westward - on a course typical of a straight runner. On September 12, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression. Following the disturbance's development of a well-defined upper-level center and an additional increase in organization, aided by the subtropical jet the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 05:30 UTC that day. At 18:00 UTC on September 12, the JTWC declared the system a tropical depression. Six hours later, the JMA upgraded the depression into a tropical storm, with the JTWC followed suit based on Dvorak classifications of T2.5/. Around this time, Flo began to track west-northwest at a pace of under the influence of a subtropical ridge to the north. Flo initially intensified at the climatological rate of one T number per day, and at 06:00 UTC on September 14, the JMA upgraded Flo to a severe tropical storm. Early the following day, both agencies classified Flo as a typhoon, although operationally the JTWC did not upgrade Flo into a typhoon until 06:00 UTC, when the storm developed a small but circular eye. After becoming a typhoon, Flo began to rapidly intensify. Over the ensuing 36 hours, the JTWC estimated that Flo deepened by . Midday on September 16, the JTWC upgraded Flo into a super typhoon, which is defined by the JTWC as a tropical cyclone with winds of at least , although satellite intensity estimates suggested that Flo was even stronger. At 06:00 UTC on September 17, the JTWC raised the intensity of the typhoon to , equal to Category 5 status on the United States-based Saffir- Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS); the basis for this was flight level observations from a Hurricane Hunter aircraft. Shortly thereafter, a dropsonde from the aircraft measured a barometric pressure of . Around this time, the JMA estimated the typhoon peaked in intensity, with winds of and a pressure of . Around the time Flo peaked in intensity, the typhoon began to recurve to the northeast in response to a deepening mid-latitude shortwave trough to the northwest, which induced a break in the subtropical ridge. At 00:00 UTC on September 18, the JTWC estimated that the typhoon weakened back to a tropical storm. Weakening continued due to increased vertical wind shear, although the warm waters of the Kuroshio Current helped Flo maintain some of its intensity. Typhoon Flo accelerated northeastward towards Honshu in response to a trough passing north of the system. Around 06:00 UTC on September 19, the storm made landfall on southern Honshu, with the JTWC and JMA reporting winds of and respectively at the time of landfall. After passing over Japan, Flo began to transition into an extratropical cyclone. At 00:00 UTC on September 20, the JMA declared Flo extratropical, while the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm. Six hours later, the JTWC issued their last warning on the system because it had completed its extratropical transition. The extratropical remnants of Flo were last noted on the morning of September 22. Preparations On September 17, 57 fights from Japan Airlines, Japan Air System, and All Nippon Airways to and from Naha were called off, stranding 57,000 passengers. Ferry service to and from Okinawa was halted and 403 schools were closed there that day. While preparing for the storm, two injures occurred in Tagaj≈ç.

It was established in 1985 in Burbank, California, United States, and was absorbed into Dolby Laboratories in a 2014 acquisition. History Doremi Labs was founded by Camille Rizko in Los Angeles in 1985. Shortly after, he was joined by fellow engineers, Emil Rizko and Safar Ghazal. The first product, the DAWN (Digital Audio Workstation Nucleus), was an editing device for dialog replacement and effects/ADR Foley. The product used a Macintosh Plus computer as its user interface. One of the features that set Doremi's DAWN apart is its ability to play 8 high quality audio tracks from a single hard disk. The product built a faithful following owing to its friendly user interface which emulates existing paper based workflow. In 1994, the company foresaw the need to replace VCRs used heavily in post production studios, with a new tapeless model. Doremi decided that rather than change customers habits, it will design a tapeless disk recorder which will emulate as close as possible existing VCRs in use. The only major difference would be instant locate to any point within the recorded video clip. The V1 digital video recorder/player (DVR) was introduced to the public in 1996, and became an instant success. Doremi soon introduced models of the recorder that supports MPEG-2, Uncompressed, High Definition and JPEG2000. The success of the V1 led to Doremi‚Äôs worldwide expansion, opening facilities in France and Japan. During that same time period, to support its own internal need for a large number of high quality, high resolution displays, Doremi built the first HDSDI to DVI converter, which allow users to have a low cost high definition monitoring system using computer displays. This innovative product was soon followed by a pattern generator. This product line was soon copied by several other manufacturers and created a whole new line of converter/generator products, which Doremi continues to pursue in the high end of the market. In 2003, Doremi introduced the Nugget, a high quality high definition player for applications such as theme parks, museums, or anywhere where a high end HD player is needed. The product captured the high end portion of the playback market, and was adopted by major entertainment corporations as the product of choice for their loop playback applications. In 2004, Doremi and Texas Instruments (TI), manufacturer of DLP digital micro-mirror imaging devices (DMDs), demonstrated cinema quality digital playback using TI's new 2K DMDs and a V1 DVR at IBC. Soon after, TI asked Doremi if they could build a server for the emerging digital cinema market. Doremi saw the opportunity and decided it was time to enter that market. Doremi started 2 simultaneous JPEG2000 compression based projects, one for a Digital Cinema Player called the DCP-2000, and the other for a Digital Mastering Station called the DMS-2000. In April 2005, Doremi demonstrated for the first time to Disney Studios, a clip of National Treasure and a clip of Chicken Little, that were mastered on the DMS-2000 and played on the DCP-2000. The success of the experiment convinced the studio that the technology was now readily available to migrate movie playback from 35mm film to digital. In June 2005, at CinemaExpo, Doremi showed for the first time a playback of a Digital Cinema Package (DCP). The package was prepared by the Digital Cinema Initiatives (DCI). Shortly after, Doremi looked to master a complete movie in digital. Universal Studios gave Doremi and Fotokem the authorization to master the upcoming movie Serenity in digital and have it ready by opening day. Doremi and Fotokem rose to the challenge despite many hurdles and showed the movie mastered on the DMS-2000, played on the DCP-2000 in September 2005, at Fotokem screening room. Shortly after, the movie was shown at the Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) on a 75-foot screen, to rave reviews. During 2005, Christie-AIX, a joint venture between Christie Digital and Access IT (Now Cinedigm), signed a Virtual Print Fee (VPF) contract with the studios to outfit 4000 screens with digital playback systems. Following the Serenity demonstration, the Doremi server was selected for the rollout, and 150 screens were installed in 2005. The rollout continued with Doremi exclusively during 2006 and 2007. In 2008, Doremi looked for other opportunities for products in the cinema market, and saw a need to design cost effective hearing aid and viewing aid devices for the physically impaired. Doremi saw a moral obligation to innovate in this field and come up with products that the exhibitors would buy, not to avoid lawsuits, but to increase the captive audience. The Captiview hearing impaired system was introduced in 2010, and the Fidelio viewing impaired system was introduced in June 2011. In 2009, Doremi introduced the first 4K integrated media block for TI's series-2 projectors, over 2 years ahead of its closest competitor. In 2011, Doremi achieved DCI Compliance for IMB / ShowVault, DCP-2000, DCP-2K4 and receives 4K technology patent US 7,868,879 B2 relating to decoding technologies within the 4K standard. Additionally, all digital viewings at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival were delivered in 4K resolution with Doremi servers. In 2012, Doremi achieved DCI Compliance for IMS1000. On February 24, 2014, Dolby Laboratories announced that it signed an agreement to acquire Doremi Labs for $92.5 million in cash plus an additional $20 million in contingent consideration. The acquisition closed on October 31, 2014 and its completion was announced on November 3, 2014. While Doremi's corporate registration status is still active with the California Secretary of State office, its operations have been absorbed into Dolby, its branded products discontinued and its website and domain registration removed from the internet.

It is written by Tony Gayton and Joe Gayton, and directed by David Von Ancken. In the episode, Thomas C. Durant (Colm Meaney) and Lily Bell (Dominique McElligott) conspire to gain arriving investors' interests, after she pleads for Cullen Bohannon (Anson Mount) to not let his vengeful path ruin him; Sean and Mickey McGinnes (Ben Esler, Phil Burke) exact their own revenge on The Swede (Christopher Heyerdahl); and Elam (Common) and Eva (Robin McLeavy) each begin to see the future differently. Plot The episode opens with a flashback. Home from the Civil War, Cullen finds the barn burning and his home ransacked. He searches for his wife Mary, only to find her dead, hanging from a rafter on the porch. After burying her body and his son's, he rides away. In the present, Durant continues to celebrate his railroad's reaching the 40-mile goal by hosting a dance, to which senators, investors, and other dignitaries may attend. He asks the town's prostitutes to escort any arriving visitors, telling them to behave like \\"proper ladies.\\" Sean and Mickey McGinnes inform Cullen that The Swede left town with two bottles of whisky, possibly to get drunk. Cullen tells them that The Swede doesn't drink. Meanwhile, at Council Bluffs, Iowa, The Swede pours drinks for Sergeant Harper (Ian Kilburn). The sergeant produces a document showing that he was discharged from the army two weeks before Mary died, and was not involved. The Swede tells him that he may not have been present, but Harper can still testify to federal marshals about Cullen's motivation to kill Johnson and the other soldiers. The marshals are en route to Hell On Wheels and will protect Harper. Back in town, Lily struggles to install floorboards in her tent and Cullen stops in to assist her. Lily learns, while Cullen works, that he has lost his wife and son. Not wishing to think about the past, nor discuss it with her, he moves to leave. Lily pleads with him not to let what happened to his wife and son kill the man they loved. Cullen replies that \\"it's too late for that.\\" After Cullen leaves, Durant visits her, presenting her with a new dress, and asks her to come to the dance to help lure potential investors. She agrees to his current need, after he allows her to remain with the railroad till its completion. Reverend Cole (Tom Noonan) loads Griggs's body into a coffin. Cullen soon enters the church tent seeking moral guidance. Cole stuns Cullen by lamenting over God's failures in the face of evil, and telling him to choose hate, because \\"it's so much easier.\\" The Swede and Harper ride into town. Sean informs Cullen that The Swede's companion is wearing a Union jacket with sergeant's stripes. Cullen returns to his tent and cleans his gun. Elam stops in to suggest that Cullen could be wrong about Harper and, echoing Cullen's advice to Elam about slavery, urges Cullen to let go of the past. Durant visits The Swede, admitting that he told Cullen about the marshals so he'd leave, but since he hasn't, Durant now wants The Swede's plan to succeed. Later, The Swede warns Harper to hide from Cullen until the marshals reach town that evening. He does hide after seeing Cullen approach the railcar. Cullen enters, armed with a pistol, demanding to know Harper's whereabouts. The Swede claims he doesn't know and dares Cullen to shoot him, which he doesn't. Eva watches as men erect a permanent town for the people staying behind after the railroad workers move on. Elam appears, and Eva mentions marrying and settling down with him. While he has agreed that he asked her to be \\"his\\", he explains that he has just received a taste of freedom, has been well paid by Durant for his labor, and isn't ready for marriage. At the dance, Durant and Lily impress the investors with tales of the speed traveling across country will be with the railroad. They dance together, but she scans the room for Cullen. In town, Cullen searches for Harper, while the McGinnes brothers and an angry mob surround The Swede. A man on horseback lassos him, and the mob tars and feathers him and runs him out of town. By nightfall, Cullen still hasn't found Harper, but continues searching the camp. As the train bearing the marshals arrives, Cullen finds Harper and chases him down, but loses his gun. Harper picks it up and points it at Cullen. He insists that he has proof he didn't kill Mary. Cullen, refusing to believe him, runs at him, knocks the gun away, and then strangles him. After Harper dies, Cullen sees the discharge notice sticking out of Harper's pocket. Reading the document, Cullen realizes his mistake. At the dance, he watches from afar as Lily dances with Durant. Lily glimpses Cullen, but he slips out of view as Durant wheels her around. When she comes full circle, Cullen is gone. Down by the tracks, Cullen admits to Elam that he killed the wrong man. With the rising sun, Cullen rides out of town and The Swede, scarred from his tarring, comes across a wanted poster offering a $250 bounty for the capture of Cullen Bohannon. Reception TV Fanatic's Sean McKenna rated the episode with 4 out of 5 stars, saying, \\"Overall, 'God of Chaos' didn't end with the same bang that the show first started out with, but it left the door wide open for plenty of strong possibilities for the future.\\" Phil Nugent of The A.V. Club rated the episode a C, saying that the season finale was \\"livelier\\" than episodes before it, adding, \\"Anyone who's ever made a dollar as a storyteller ought to have some ideas about how to get an audience's attention at the start of things, and how to bring things to a boil at the close, especially if the close is also meant to get them to come back in a year.\\" The season one finale was watched by 2.84 million viewers, marking the highest viewership since the fourth episode, and kept its steady 0.7 rating with the 18-49 age range.

Downstream from Budogoshch the Pchyovzha reenters Novgorod Oblast. The mouth of the Pchyovzha is close to the village of Melekhovskaya, almost at the border between Novgorod and Leningrad Oblasts. The river basin of the Pchyovzha comprises the western part of Lyubytinsky District, the north of Chudovsky District, the southwestern part of Kirishsky District, as well as some areas in the southern part of Boksitogorsky District of Leningrad Oblast.

Historically, they could also be considered as extending several centuries back to the relations between earlier regimes in Egypt ‚Äì the highly autonomous Egypt Eyalet in the Ottoman Empire and the Kingdom of Egypt ‚Äì and the earlier manifestations of Saudi/Wahhabi power in the Arabian Peninsula (Emirate of Diriyah). Saudi Arabia and Egypt are both highly influential countries in the Arab world, with Egypt being the most populous Arab country and Saudi Arabia being a member of the G20. According to a 2013 Pew global opinion poll, 78% of Egyptians express a favourable view of Saudi Arabia, with only 19% expressing an unfavourable view.Saudi Arabia‚Äôs Image Falters among Middle East Neighbors Pew Research Global Attitudes Project. 17 October 2013. History 19th century Muhammad Ali Between 1811 and 1818 Ibrahim Pasha, son of Muhammad Ali of Egypt, governor of Egypt, led a campaign against the Emirate of Diriyah ‚Äì as the First Saudi State was known ‚Äì on behalf of the Ottoman Sultan. Ibrahim conquered Hejaz and Nejd and brought that first Saudi state to an end. 20th century Gamal Abdel Nasser era Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat meeting in 1970. In the years immediately after the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 relations between Egypt and Saudi Arabia were cordial, driven by mutual suspicion of the Hashemites reigning in Jordan and (especially) Iraq at the time, and continuing from an anti-Hashemite alliance formed by King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia, King Farouk of Egypt and President Shukri al-Quwatli of Syria after the foundation of the Arab League in 1945. Subsequently, Nasser and King Saud of Saudi Arabia co-operated to limit the reach of the Baghdad Pact, which they felt was designed to increase the influence of Hashemite Iraq. As a result, the two countries signed a bilateral military pact in 1955, and worked to successfully prevent Jordan from joining the Baghdad Pact. Egypt came to have extensive involvement in the Saudi army, economy and education system. However the alliance was undermined by Saudi anxieties about the Egyptian government's promotion of anti-monarchical forces in the Arab World (including the uncovering of an Egyptian-style Saudi Free Officers Movement and increasing labour unrest). Egypt's increasing shift towards the Soviet Union, and efforts by Iraq and its western allies including the United States to drive a wedge between the two countries. By 1958 this deterioration in the relationship had led to King Saud offering a bribe of ¬£1.9 million to Abdel Hamid al-Sarraj, the head of Syrian intelligence at the time and later Vice- President of the United Arab Republic, to secure the assassination of Nasser. Thus under President Gamal Abdel Nasser, Egypt, backed by the Soviet Union, came to represent the Non-Aligned Movement and pan-Arabism, and was a nominal advocate of secularism and republicanism. The Saudis by contrast were strong supporters of absolute monarchy and Islamist theocracy, and were generally close to the governments of the United Kingdom and United States. This meant that the Saudi-Egyptian rivalry was one of the many threads of the Arab Cold War, which was manifested for example in the North Yemen Civil War, in which a Nasserist military junta headed by Abdullah as-Sallal overthrew the pro-Saudi Yemeni monarchy. Anwar Sadat era Egypt was also opposed by Saudi Arabia when it became the first Arab country to make peace with Israel. However relations between Egypt and Saudi Arabia warmed considerably during Sadat's rule, with the Saudis playing a key role in persuading Sadat to carry out the expulsion of 20,000 Soviet military advisers from Egypt in 1972. The Saudis also doubled the amount of money they sent to Egypt in subsidies in the early 1970s to $200 million a year, bought French Mirage fighter jets on the Egyptians' behalf to reduce their reliance on Soviet military technology, and offered low-interest loans to Egypt. In 1973 The Egyptian and Saudi governments also co-ordinated the Yom Kippur War with the OAPEC oil embargo against Israel's western allies, leading to the 1973 oil crisis. Hosni Mubarak era Unlike the situation at the time of Nasser, Mubarak's Egypt ‚Äì a conservative dictatorship closely allied with the United States ‚Äì no longer represented an ideological or political polar opposite to Saudi Arabia. Nevertheless, there remained a rivalry between the two countries, both aspiring to preeminence in the Arab World in general and among the Arab allies of the US in particular. This rivalry manifested itself, for example, when U.S. President Barack Obama made a major tour of the Middle East in 2009, soon after assuming power. The Saudis resented Obama's choice of Cairo as the venue for making a key policy speech, and State Department officials made an effort to mollify them by following up the Cairo speech with a high-profile Presidential visit to the Saudi capital. During the 2011 Egyptian revolution, Saudi King Abdullah expressed support for Hosni Mubarak. \\"No Arab or Muslim can tolerate any meddling in the security and stability of Arab and Muslim Egypt by those who infiltrated the people in the name of freedom of expression, exploiting it to inject their destructive hatred. As they condemn this, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its people and government declares it stands with all its resources with the government of Egypt and its people.\\" He condemned the \\"people who tried to destabilise the security and stability of Egypt.\\" 2011‚Äìpresent After the 2011 Egyptian revolution, relations between the two countries greatly deteriorated. 2011 Jeddah airport protest On 9 April 2011, hundreds of Egyptians gathered at the Saudi embassy in Cairo to protest mistreatment of Umrah pilgrims by Saudi Arabian Airlines and King Abdulaziz International Airport authorities in Jeddah. They wanted the Saudi ambassador, Hisham Nazer, to exit the country immediately. The protesters argued that the airport did not arrange enough flights back to Egypt in time for Eid ul-Fitr after thousands were stranded in the country. They also expressed disgust over how Saudi Arabian Airlines officials treated pilgrims at the airport, and protested that Saudi officials had meddled in Egyptian affairs during the revolution. 2012 Saudi Arabia embassy lock- up A protester outside the Saudi Embassy in Cairo holds up a flag saying \\"Down with Military Rule\\" On 28 April 2012, Saudi Arabia announced the closure of its Cairo embassy and its consulates in Alexandria and Suez, following Egyptian protests over the detention of the Egyptian lawyer Ahmed al-Gizawi in Saudi Arabia.Egyptian protests over detained lawyer shut Saudi embassy, BBC News, 28 April 2012. Earlier in April 2012, al-Gizawi was detained shortly after his arrival in Saudi Arabia, which some believe was because he defamed King Abdullah by filing a lawsuit in a South Cairo court against Saudi monarch King Abdullah on behalf of Egyptian citizens held without charge in Saudi prisons.El-Gizawi case to be transferred to Saudi pre-trial committee\\", Ahram Online (1 May 2012). Saudi authorities said he was arrested at the King Abdulaziz International Airport near Jeddah on 17 April for possession of 21,000 Xanax anti-anxiety pills, which are banned in the country. They expressed doubt that he intended to go on a pilgrimage, as he was not wearing the typical white pilgrim dress (Ihram). According to his wife, he was sentenced in absentia to a year in prison and 20 lashes after he arrived for a pilgrimage (Umrah). An estimated 1,000 Egyptian protesters demonstrated in front of the Saudi embassy in Cairo on 27 April, demanding the release of al- Gizawi and of the other Egyptians held in Saudi jails. Following the protests Saudi authorities announced the closure of the Saudi embassy and other consulates in Egypt. Egypt's head of military council, Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, said Egypt is working to heal the rift with Saudi Arabia over the surprise decision. Observers said that it is the worst fall-out in relations between the two countries since Saudi Arabia severed its ties with Egypt in 1979. Reconciliation Soon after the embassy incident, Saudi Arabia announced that they would return ambassador Ahmad Abdulaziz Kattan and his envoy to Egypt after feverish efforts by Egyptian politicians, fearing the loss of aid, to gain back Saudi favor. King Abdullah said that he could \\"not allow this passing crisis to go on for long\\". On 10 May 2012, ambassador Kattan announced that the kingdom agreed to provide US$500 million in aid to Egypt and will deposit an additional US$1 billion at the country's central bank as part of the $2.7 billion support package they had agreed in 2011. Saudi Arabia will also export $250 million worth of butane to Egypt, which has faced ongoing shortages of the fuel, as well as US$200 million to help small and mid-sized firms. The donation was part of a move by multiple Gulf states to send a large aid package to Egypt. Visit of Morsi Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi's first official visit was to Saudi Arabia in July 2012, although he was the presidential candidate of the Muslim Brotherhood, whose views are not fully aligned with those of the Saudi government. At the time, Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi stated that Saudi Arabia is a pragmatic country and that whoever the president of Egypt is, Saudi government is aware of the fact that it has to maintain good relations with this country. After July 2013 Saudi Arabia was among the various countries that explicitly welcomed the appointment of the interim government following the July 2013 removal of Morsi from office.http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/08/201381615196784361.htmlhttps://www.brookings.edu/opinions/saudi- arabia-cheers-the-coup-in-egypt/ Soon afterward, relations between the two countries improved greatly. In April 2016, King Salman of Saudi Arabia made a five-day visit to Egypt, during which the two countries signed economic agreements worth approximately $25 billion and also made an agreement to \\"return\\" Tiran and Sanafir, two Egyptian-administered islands in the Gulf of Aqaba, to Saudi control. The announcement of the transfer of the islands provoked a backlash in Egypt, in both social media and traditional media, including outlets which had been firmly supportive of the Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Over the issue between Saudi Arabia and Egypt on Sanafir and Tiran, talks between Yitzhak Molcho from Israel and Sameh Shoukry, the Foreign Minister of Egypt, were leaked, according to the Middle East Monitor. The Muslim Brotherhood is linked to the \\"Middle East Monitor\\". The Middle East Eye leaked the audio. Muslim Brotherhood supporters are connected to the \\"Middle East Eye\\". Eric Trager noted that the tape was leaked by an agency run by the Muslim Brotherhood. Egypt has also strongly backed the Saudi stance during the Qatar diplomatic crisis. In 2019, Saudi Arabia pledged an amount of $7 million for developmental projects in Egypt.

In 1942 the name cryptomelane was proposed as part of an effort to sort out the manganese oxide minerals referred to as psilomelane.

Jordan and Saudi Arabia are both Sunni monarchies. Jordan, along with Morocco, the only other non-Persian Gulf monarchy, were invited in May 2011 to join the Gulf Cooperation Council, an organization of monarchies in and around the Persian Gulf. Historically, the Hashemite dynasty came to Jordan from the Hijaz, now called Saudi Arabia. The Hashemites ruled Mecca from the 10th century until 1924, when the House of Saud invaded the area in the Saudi conquest of Hejaz. Map of 1965 land swap between Jordan and Saudi Arabia The two cities of Aqaba and Ma'an were part of the Kingdom of Hejaz (1916‚Äì1925). In May 1925, Ibn Saud gave up the Aqaba and Ma‚Äôan districts of the Hejaz and it became part of British Emirate of Transjordan.http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/his_transjordan.html In 1965, Saudi Arabia and Jordan agreed to trade land, thus finalising the Jordan‚ÄìSaudi Arabia border. Jordan gained 19 kilometers of land on the Gulf of Aqaba and 6,000 square kilometers of territory in the interior, and 7,000 square kilometers of Jordanian-administered, landlocked territory was ceded to Saudi Arabia. According to a 2013 Pew global opinion poll, 88% of Jordanians express a favourable view of Saudi Arabia, with 11% expressing an unfavourable view, the most favourable opinion of the KSA in the Middle East.Saudi Arabia‚Äôs Image Falters among Middle East Neighbors Pew Research Global Attitudes Project After the elevation of Mohammed bin Salman to Saudi Crown Prince, relations have deteriorated over Saudi attempts to sideline Jordan in negotiations over the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, Jordan's reluctant support the Saudi position during the 2017‚Äì18 Qatar diplomatic crisis and limited involvement in the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, and growing Jordanian ties with Turkey.

Biography Nikita Sakharov was born in Siberia in 1915. He began his education at a rural Siberian school, moved to the city of Chita to continue his studies, and came to Leningrad in the early 1930s to attend the Institute of the Peoples of the North. He began writing as a student. His best-known work, the 1938 novel Red Suglan, described the initiation of collective farming in the rural north. Nikita Sakharov volunteered for the Red Army after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. A decorated serviceman, he died fighting in Germany in April 1945. Sakharov's literary works were republished or published in Russian-language translation for the first time after the war, and much of his reputation as a writer is based on the literary research carried out in the post-war period. The Soviet Evenk historian Vasily Uchanov described Red Suglan as \\"the most conspicuous Evenk literary work of the 1930s.\\"Uchanov, V. N. (1975).

McDonnell worked as a television critic on The Sunday Press. As a playwright his work is most closely associated with the Ulster Group Theatre, Belfast, where he wrote a string of successful comedy plays in the 1960s and 1970s in association with the actor and comedian James Young. Life and career McDonnell was born in Kilsaran, Co. Louth. McDonnell, and his wife Patti, lived in Dublin where he worked as a journalist and playwright. In 1961 McDonnell wrote All the King's Horses, which was performed at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin. The story is a farcical one in which an eccentric Irish woman dies and leaves her fortune to her two nephews. One is a Southern Irish Republican and the other is a Northern Irish Orangeman. To inherit the fortune they must spend a month in the cottage in peace. The play came to the attention of Belfast based actor James Young, who contacted the author with a view to performing the play at the Ulster Group Theatre. As had been his practice with his former writer Sam Cree, Young felt that the play would need reworked for a Belfast audience. Young was quoted as saying about McDonnell that he had \\"no arty airs about him and, being a journalist, set about the changes I suggested in a most realistic fashion\\". McDonnell's rewrites would remove some of the more serious aspects of the play and introduced a new character. The play was a financial success and McDonnell and Young formed a creative partnership that would last until the time of Young's death in 1974. They formed a working relationship in which Young would develop an idea for a play and, after several phone calls, McDonnell would write the first draft on the script. McDonnell would send this draft to Young to rehearse the actors. Young would remove bits and add sequences to make the play as funny as possible, which McDonnell would then redraft. A standing joke between the two on the opening night of a play was that McDonnell would remark to Young \\"a lovely play, Jimmy. I'm so glad you used my title\\". McDonnell and Young would jointly adapt two existing English plays, Friends and Neighbours and Love Locked Out, to a Northern Irish setting. McDonnell would go on to be credited as the sole writer of another nine plays that premiered at the Ulster Group Theatre. He would also serve as writer of various sketches in Young's one man shows and write Young's 1970s Television series Saturday Night. Of all of McDonnell's plays, only the original version of All the King's Horses appears to have been published professionally. While his reworking of All the King's Horses for the Belfast production and a version of Silver Wedding, with the characters names and setting changed for a Dublin audience, exist in typescript form, originally available direct from the author. No versions of his other plays are currently known to exist as of January 2012.

Originally published entitled Le Roi de la Th√©ocratie Pharaonique (Paris: Flammarion, 1961). John Anthony West, an author and alternative Egyptologist, investigated Schwaller de Lubicz's ideas further and, in 1989, sought the opinion of Robert M. Schoch, a geologist and associate professor of natural science at the College of General Studies at Boston University. From his investigation of the enclosure's geology, Schoch concluded the main type of weathering evident on the Sphinx enclosure walls was caused by prolonged and extensive rainfall. According to Schoch, the area has experienced a mean annual rainfall of approximately one inch (2.5 cm) since the Old Kingdom ( ‚Äì 2134 BC), such that, since Egypt's last period of significant rainfall ended between the late fourth and early 3rd millennium BC,Palaeoclimate and environment , Fezzan Project, Climate Research Unit, Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of East Anglia. Retrieved 2008. the Sphinx's construction must date to the 6th or 5th millennium BC.Schoch, Robert M.

Schoch further notes the same heavy precipitation-induced weathering as seen on the walls of the Sphinx enclosure is also found on the core blocks of the Sphinx and Valley Temples, both known to have been originally constructed from blocks taken from the Sphinx enclosure when the body was carved. Though the presence of extensive 4th Dynasty repair work to the Sphinx and associated temples is acknowledged by such Egyptologists as Mark Lehner and Zahi Hawass, Schoch contends: \\"Therefore if the granite facing is covering deeply weathered limestone, the original limestone structures must predate by a considerable degree the granite facing. Obviously, if the limestone cores (originating from the Sphinx ditch) of the temples predate the granite ashlars (granite facings), and the granite ashlars are attributable to Khafre of the Fourth Dynasty, then the Great Sphinx was built prior to the reign of Khafre.\\" Colin Reader, a British geologist, agrees that the suggested evidence of weathering indicates prolonged water erosion. Reader found, inter alia, that the flow of rainwater causing the weathering had been stemmed by the construction of 'Khufu's quarries',L√∂hner, Franz; Zuberb√ºhler, Teresa (2006). Building the Great Pyramid: Quarries in Ancient Egypt. Updated 2006. Retrieved 2009. which lie directly \\"upstream\\" of the Sphinx enclosure, and therefore concludes that the Sphinx must predate the reign of Khufu (2589‚Äì2566 BC), and certainly Khafra, by several hundred years. Reader disagrees with Schoch's palaeometeorological estimates, and instead concludes that the Sphinx dates to the Early Dynastic Period (c. 3150‚Äì2686 BC).Giulio Magli, Mysteries and Discoveries of Archaeoastronomy: From Giza to Easter Island, page 374 (Praxis Publishing Limited, 2009). To explain the disproportionate size of the head compared to the body, Reader, as does Schoch, also suggests the head of the Sphinx was originally that of a lion and recarved sometime later in the likeness of a pharaoh. Response of Egyptologists and archaeologists Zahi Hawass, former Egyptian minister of state for antiquities affairs and secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, was asked in an interview on the PBS series NOVA if it was possible that a more ancient civilization might have sculpted the Sphinx. Hawass replied: \\"Of course it is not possible for one reason ‚Ä¶. No single artifact, no single inscription, or pottery, or anything has been found until now, in any place [in Egypt] to predate the Egyptian civilization more than 5,000 years ago.\\" This reasoning and conclusion was supported in a similar NOVA interview by Mark Lehner, another senior Egyptologist. Other archaeologists who have made similar criticisms include Kenneth Feder.Kenneth L. Feder, Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis to the Walam Olum, page 130 (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2010). A different argument used by Egyptologists to ascribe the Sphinx to Khafra is the \\"context\\" theory, which notes that the Sphinx is located in the context of the funerary complex surrounding the Second Pyramid, which is traditionally connected with Khafra.Lehner, Mark (Spring 2002). \\"Unfinished Business: The Great Sphinx\\" in Aeragram, 5:2 (Spring 2002), 10‚Äì14. Retrieved 2008. Apart from the Causeway, the Pyramid and the Sphinx, the complex also includes the Sphinx Temple and the Valley Temple, both of which display the same architectural style, with 100-tonne stone blocks quarried out of the Sphinx enclosure. A diorite statue of Khafra, which was discovered buried upside down along with other debris in the Valley Temple, is claimed as support for the Khafra theory. Reader agrees that the Sphinx Temple and Valley Temple are closely associated with the Sphinx, as is the Causeway and even part of the Khafra Mortuary Temple, but suggests this evidence merely indicates these structures also predate Khafra and does not link the Sphinx in any way to Khafra. Rainer Stadelmann, former director of the German Archaeological Institute in Cairo suggests Khufu, Khafra's father, was the builder of the Sphinx and contends Khafra's Causeway was built to conform to a pre-existing structure which he concludes, given its location, could only have been the Sphinx. Lehner's official website also offers a similar argument based on an Archaeological sequence of structures built in the area. Lehner points to the way several structures in the area incorporate elements from older structures, and based on the order in which they were constructed concludes that the archaeological sequencing does not allow for a date older than the reign of Khafra. Hawass points to the poor quality of much of the Giza limestone as the basis for the significant erosion levels. He has concluded, from the present-day rapid rate of erosion on the Member II surface of the Sphinx, that \\"[t]he eleven hundred years between Khafre and the first major restoration in the Eighteenth Dynasty, or even half this time, would have been more than enough to erode the Member II into the deep recesses behind Phase I restoration masonry\\". Schoch states that other structures and surfaces on the Giza Plateau are made from the same band of limestone as the Sphinx enclosure, but they do not show the same erosion as the walls of the Sphinx enclosure. Peter Lacovara, an Egyptologist and curator at the Michael C. Carlos Museum at Emory University, Atlanta, assigns \\"some of the erosional features\\" on the enclosure walls to quarrying activities rather than weathering, and states that other wear and tear on the Sphinx itself is due to groundwater percolation and wind erosion. Response of other geologists Some geologists have proposed alternative explanations for the evidence of weathering in the Sphinx enclosure. One of the alternative erosion mechanisms proposed is called haloclasty. Moisture on limestone will dissolve salts, which are then carried by percolating moisture into the spaces inside the porous limestone. When the moisture dries the salt crystallises, and the expanding crystals cause a fine layer of surface limestone to flake off. It is accepted by Schoch et al. that this mechanism is evident in many places on the Giza Plateau. One proponent of the haloclasty process is Dr James A. Harrell of the University of Toledo, who advocates that the deep erosion crevices were caused by the haloclasty process being driven by moisture in the sand that covered the carved rock for much of the time since it was exposed by quarrying. Lal Gauri et al.Gauri, K. Lal; Sinai, John J.; Bandyopadhyay, Jayanta K. (1995‚Äì04). \\"Geologic Weathering and Its Implications on the Age of the Sphinx\\", Geoarchaeology: an International Journal, 10:2 (April 1995), 119‚Äì133. ISSN 0883-6353. also favour the haloclasty process to explain the erosion features, but have theorised that the weathering was driven by moisture deriving from atmospheric precipitation such as dew. Analysis of the Sphinx's bedrock by the Getty Conservation Institute (1990‚Äì1992) concluded that \\"Continual salt crystallization, which has a destructive effect on the stone, would explain at least some of the deterioration of the Sphinx.\\"\\"Getty Institute Probes Riddle of the Deteriorating Sphinx\\" by Kim Murphy, Los Angeles Times, 16 May 1990 Vertical weathering on the body of the Sphinx Haloclasty is rejected as an explanation for the vertical erosion features by Schoch because it does not explain all the visible evidence, namely that the water erosion features are not evenly distributed, being concentrated in those areas that would have been particularly exposed to running water, whereas the haloclasty process should have operated evenly on all exposed limestone surfaces. Similarly, Schoch points out that the alternative explanations do not account for the absence of similar weathering patterns on other rock surfaces in the Giza pyramid complex which were cut from the same limestone beds. In an article published in the January 2015 issue of GEO ExPro magazine, geoscientist J√∏rn Christiansen provided his own analysis of the \\"vertical weathering\\" after visiting the Sphinx. Christiansen found evidence that shows that at least some of the erosion took place before the Sphinx was carved. He stated that water most likely seeped through natural fissures in the limestone before the Sphinx had been carved, causing the walls of the Sphinx enclosure to look like they were carved much earlier than they really were. As such, Christiansen determined that there was no geological evidence to suggest the Sphinx was carved earlier than any other monuments on the Giza plateau. Reader, who agrees that the Sphinx predates Khafra but prefers a construction date within the Early Dynastic Period, points to the tombs dug into the enclosure walls during Twenty-sixth Dynasty (c. 600 BC), and notes that the entrances of the tombs have weathered so lightly that original chisel marks are still clearly visible. He points out that if the weathering on the enclosure walls (up to a metre deep in places) had been created by any of the proposed alternative causes of erosion, then the tomb entrances would have been weathered much more severely than they are in the modern day. It is also agreed that wind erosion has played a significant role in eroding the Sphinx. Schoch states that wind erosion forms distinctive horizontal bands, whereas the water erosion features are clearly vertical. Response of climatologists Recent studies by German climatologists Rudolph Kuper and Stefan Kr√∂pelin, of the University of Cologne suggest the change from a wet to a much drier climate may have come to an end around 3500‚Äì1500 BC, which is as much as 500 years later than currently thought. Egyptologist Mark Lehner believes this climate change may have been responsible for the severe weathering found on the Sphinx and other sites of the 4th Dynasty. After studying sediment samples in the Nile Valley, Judith Bunbury, a geologist at the University of Cambridge, concluded that climate change in the Giza region may have begun early in the Old Kingdom, with desert sands arriving in force late in the era.Haddingham, Evan \\"Uncovering Secrets of the Sphinx\\" Smithsonian magazine, February 2010 Schoch points out that mudbrick mastabas on the Saqqara plateau about 20 km away, indisputably dated to Dynasties I and II, have survived relatively undamaged, which he believes indicates that no heavy rainfall has occurred in the region since the Early Dynastic Period, and nor was any heavy rain anticipated by those Early Dynastic Period communities who built those structures. Reader replied to this, stating that they \\"were built on an area of high ground and do not lie within any natural catchment. These tombs will not, therefore, have been exposed to any significant run- off.\\" He concludes that \\"the fact that they are not significantly degraded, as Schoch has pointed out, demonstrates that rainfall itself has not been a significant agent of degradation in Egypt.\\" Rainfall water run-off, however, has been a more significant factor. Reader cites evidence of flood water damage in another location to illustrate this.White, Chris, The Age of the Sphinx? Colin Reader vs. Robert Schoch ‚Äì Water Erosion?

Apart from Cotherstone, his classic winners included Surplice, Orlando and Newminster and he was Champion sire on four occasions. Bowes sent Cotherstone into training with John Scott who trained forty classic winners at his base at Whitewall stables, Malton, North Yorkshire. The colt was ridden in most of his important races by the trainer's younger brother, Bill Scott. Cotherstone was not an impressive individual at first, being weak and sickly as a yearling, and making little progress as a two-year-old. He was described as being \\"thin-fleshed\\" and \\"always amiss\\". Racing career 1842: two-year-old season Cotherstone began to show potential towards the end of 1842 and despite being beaten in a private trial race by a colt named The Era (a future Northumberland Plate winner), he was sent to run at Newmarket in the autumn. Before he ran, Cotherstone had been introduced into the betting lists for the following year's Derby, with bookmakers offering odds of 20/1 on 20 October. On 24 October he made his public debut when he ran in the Criterion Stakes in which he finished unplaced behind Gaper, Pineapple and Testy. Four days later he reappeared in the Nursery Stakes in which he ran a dead-heat with an unnamed filly later called Mania. The owners of the two winners agreed to divide the prize money. Cotherstone's efforts at Newmarket did not impress the bookmakers and his odds for the Derby drifted out to 50/1. At the end of 1842, Bowes lost patience with the colt and planned to sell him to Scott, but the deal fell through at the last moment. 1843: three-year- old season Spring In early 1843 an impressive performance in a training gallop with a good horse name All Fours convinced Bowes and John Scott that Cotherstone was a serious contender for the Derby. Bill Scott, who rode the colt in the trial was convinced that he was the best that he had ever ridden. Bowes placed a series of large bets on the colt and arranged for strict security measures at the Malton stables to protect him from any attempts by unscrupulous bookmakers to \\"nobble\\" (deliberately injure) him. Cotherstone made his first public appearance as a three-year-old at the Craven meeting at Newmarket on 17 April when ran in the Riddlesworth Stakes. Ridden by Frank Butler, he settled in second place before going clear in the closing stages to win by three lengths from Pompey. His odds for the Derby were immediately shortened from 20/1 to 12/1. Two days later he added the Column Produce Stakes, in which the beaten horses included the filly Extempore, who went on to win the 1000 Guineas. So impressive were Cotherstone's performances that when he returned to Newmarket for the 2000 Guineas at the Spring meeting, only two horses turned out to oppose him. Starting at odds of 1/3 he won by three lengths in \\"a mere canter\\" from Cornopean and Mallard. Summer Bill Scott called Cotherstone the best colt he ever rode. Shortly before the 1843 Derby, John Scott moved Cotherstone from Malton to complete his preparations at a stable at Leatherhead, where the colt was visited and viewed at exercise by the Queen and Prince Albert. At Epsom on 31 May, Cotherstone started 13/8 favourite for the Derby in a field of twenty-three runners, with Gaper being made second choice at 5/1. Despite the damp and misty weather, the race attracted the customary huge crowd, which included Prince George of Cambridge and his brother-in-law the Prince Royal of Mecklenburg. After a delay caused by the behaviour of a colt named Highlander, the race began with Gaper taking an early lead. The second favourite set such a strong pace that most of the runners were soon struggling and only four other horses- Khorassan, Cotherstone, Siricol and Gorhambury- were still in contention when the leader turned into the straight. Gaper then began to tire and Bill Scott sent Cotherstone into the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish. Gorhambury (rumoured to be a four-year-old \\"ringer\\") emerged as his only challenger, but the result was never in serious doubt as the favourite steadily increased his advantage to win easily by two lengths. Apart from the ¬£4,250 prize money, Bowes took an estimated ¬£30,000 in winning bets. Celebrations at Malton were delayed, however, as the homing pigeons dispatched to convey the news of Cotherstone's victory failed to arrive. On his first race after the Derby, Cotherstone was sent to Goodwood. On 25 July he took the Gratwicke Stakes by two lengths from Khorassan, winning a first prize of ¬£2,150. Regarding the ease of Cotherstone's victory, the Sporting magazine commented that \\"it would indeed be a mockery to call this a race\\". Autumn Cotherstone with jockey, in the black jacket of John Bowes On 12 September, Cotherstone traveled from Malton to Doncaster where he attempted to become the first horse to win the 2000 Guineas, the Derby and the St Leger. Although these races were recognised as the most important races of the year for three-year-old colts, the term \\"Triple Crown\\" did not come into common use for another thirty years. With Bill Scott injured, Frank Butler took the ride, and Cotherstone started the 4/6 favourite against eight opponents. His odds had drifted out from 1/2 just before the race as a great number of bets were placed on his stable companion Prizefighter. Prizefighter set off in front, set a very strong pace and was still leading in the straight. Cotherstone moved up to contest the lead together with the outsider Nutwith and the three colts raced together throughout the final quarter of a mile. Cotherstone held a slight lead inside the final furlong, but Nutwith, under a strong ride from Job Marson, caught him in the last strides and won by a head with Prizefighter a neck away in third. There was considerable anger after the race among followers of the Scott stable who felt that the race tactics had not suited either of their runners. There were also allegations that Frank Butler, had pulled Cotherstone (held him back to prevent him from winning) on the orders of John Gully, who had wagered heavily on Prizefighter. Two days later, Cotherstone reappeared to win the ¬£200 Three Year Old Stakes, easily beating Napier by two lengths. On his final start of the season, Cotherstone ran in the valuable Royal Stakes at Newmarket in October. Carrying a ten pound weight penalty, he won the ¬£1,195 prize \\"without an effort\\" by a length from Fakeaway. Cotherstone's seven wins in 1843 earned his owner at least ¬£12,765, making him the most successful horse of the year in Britain: the second highest earner was Gaper with ¬£3,600 Later reports give Cotherstone's winnings as ¬£13,790 1844: four-year-old season Before he ran as a four-year-old, Cotherstone was sold for 3,000 guineas as a potential Stallion to Lord Spencer. He made his first and only appearance of the year in a Sweepstakes at Goodwood. He broke down injured in the race, and never ran again. Assessment Cotherstone was held in extremely high regard by contemporary observers. Commenting on his defeat in the St Leger the American Turf Register and Sporting Magazine described Cotherstone as \\"the best horse we have had for years\\", while a writer in the 1844 edition of the New Sporting Almanack referred to him as \\"the greatest winner of these modern days\\" and compared him to the 18th Century champions Flying Childers and Eclipse. \\"Sylvanus\\", writing in Bentley's Miscellany, called Cotherstone \\"as magnificent an animal as ever rounded Tattenham Corner\\". Stud career Cotherstone was retired to stand as a stallion at Lord Spencer's stud at Althorp, where he sired a few good horses without ever living up to expectations. The best of his progeny were Speed the Plough, who won the Criterion Stakes and the Stewards' Cup winners Glenmasson and Pumicestone. He was also successful as a sire of hunters and show horses. According to one account, Cotherstone was not exercised in retirement and became grossly overweight, seldom moving from his box for years at a time. By the time he was visited by \\"The Druid\\" (E. H. Dixon) in 1861 however, he seemed to be in good health and was dividing his time between quietly grazing and walking round the sunny side of his paddock. He died in April 1864. Pedigree Cotherstone was inbred 3 √ó 4 to the stallion Waxy and the mare Penelope. This means that these horses appeared in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree, as the parents of the brothers Whalebone and Whisker.

She has received statewide and national honors and awards for her advocacy work on behalf of families and individuals with mental illness. Serving as an advocate in Olympia, Washington, Owen has participated in the introduction and successful passage of health and human services legislation. In 1978, she founded the Washington Advocates for the Mentally Ill and the following year in Wisconsin, she co- founded the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI), which is the largest public initiative in the US that works to support families and individuals facing mental health difficulties. The organization encompasses over 1,200 affiliates at the regional, state, and federal level in every geographical region throughout the US. Offices can also be found in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Canada. In 1999, King County Executive and Deputy Secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, Ron Sims, honored her with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the King County Mental Health Exemplary Service Awards. In 2000, she received the Jefferson Award from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer for her advocacy work on behalf of individuals and families affected by mental illness.  Personal background  Eleanor Elizabeth DeVito was born on January 22, 1921, in Brooklyn, New York City. She was the third of eight children and eldest daughter born to Charles Francis \\"Frank\\" and Elvira \\"Abirone\\" (n√©e Mazzatenda) DeVito, Italian immigrants from Chieti, Italy. Her siblings included brothers Francis, Albert, and Charles; and sisters Mildred (Starin), Gloria (Freer), Genevieve (Glynn), and Evelyn (Carbone). When she was a young child, the DeVito family moved to Balmville, a small hamlet overlooking the Hudson River in upstate New York. The DeVito children attended school together in a small, three-room school house. Following an academic assessment in elementary school, Eleanor advanced a couple levels, graduating early. In summer 1936, DeVito was responsible for the care of her younger siblings and decided to take them all to a local swimming hole to cool off. She parked the car on the far side of railroad tracks from the water. After a day of enjoyment, she called for each child to jump in the car for the drive home and honked the car horn, hoping they would hurry along. Unbeknownst to her, a train was coming. Her six-year-old brother, Charles, was killed instantly while crossing the railroad tracks. \\"It took me a long time to accept the fact that I was responsible for that, but it did happen, and I had to come to terms with it.\\" Marriage and family In 1952, DeVito married John Lewis Owen in Kennewick, Washington. Together, they had two children, Susan and John, Jr. In 1955, the Owen family relocated Seattle, when John accepted an engineering position with the Boeing Company.\\"Simplicity Marks Wedding Of Miss Eleanor Elizabeth DeVito\\", Tri-City Herald, July 20, 1952, page 12. Owen is passionate in her advocacy work due to the illness of her son, John, Jr., known as \\"Jody\\". In 1974, he was hospitalized and diagnosed with schizophrenia. The illness manifested through threatening voices that terrified her son, causing him to withdraw. At times, he became catatonic, curling up into a ball. He also developed an involuntary movement disorder that manifested as uncontrolled movement in his upper body and limbs. Owen has stated that her son \\"was hibernating. He was living in a box in the basement. Then he made a noose and hung it up\\". When she found the noose, she became determined to do everything she could to help her son. When he was 21 years old, Jody was arrested for killing a man in a bar. When the prosecutor and attorney agreed to accept an insanity plea, he was sent to Western State Hospital for six years. In 2011, Seattle Times reporter Maureen O'Hagan wrote an article about Owen, entitled \\"Eleanor Owen's tireless battle for mental-health care\\", which was featured in the Seattle Times' Pacific Northwest Magazine. Referring to Owen as a \\"local legend\\", O'Hagan provided an in-depth look at Owen's life which included the background of her son's early descent into schizophrenia, which manifested in suicidal ideation and eventual murder of a man in a local bar. In response, she began working to address the stigma and lack of services for families and individuals living with mental illness. She is known on a national level for her advocacy work and insight into practical and effective ways to work toward recovery from schizophrenia and reformation of the societal view of victims and families experiencing mental illness in their lives. The Pacific Northwest Magazine article about Owen received praise from the Washington State Coalition to Improve Mental Health Reporting. On June 10, 2011, O'Hagan was presented with the Washington State 2010‚Äì2011 Mental Health Reporting Award. In honor of O'Hagan, University of Washington professor of journalism, Roger Simpson stated that \\"Maureen O'Hagan's profile of Eleanor Owens directs attention to the importance of engaging passionately with the mental health system in the broadest sense, from state agencies to pharmaceutical companies, while staying focused, as a good story does, on the dynamic woman at its center.\\" In response to receiving the award, O'Hagan stated > We set out to write a profile of Eleanor because she has a long and > interesting history with the mental health system‚Äîand because she's such a > personality, to boot. But it was her son Jody who quietly provided what we > considered to be some of the most valuable insights. Through this very > personal story, we were able to write about larger issues that have touched > so many lives. We're truly honored to have this work recognized. When she turned 90 years of age, Owen announced that she started writing her memoirs, which includes stories of surviving a \\"chaotic Italian immigrant family\\" during the Depression. Educational background When Owen was just 16 years old, she graduated from Newburgh Free Academy. Her goals included attending nursing school following high school. While she successfully passed the entrance exam, she was not allowed to enroll in the nursing school, due to policy that only accepted new students age 17 and older. Once she turned 17, Owen briefly studied nursing at Mount Saint Mary College (MSMC), before enrolling at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts (AADA), where she focused on acting and costume design.\\"Red Mill To Be Presented In Richland\\", Wall Wall Union Bulletin, October 30, 1952, page 13. After graduation from the AADA, she studied journalism at Columbia University, followed by a stint as a junior reporter for Newburgh Daily News, earning $17 per week.\\"Exceptional Talents To Add Much To Red Mill Operetta\\", Tri-City Herald, November 4, 1952, page 5. After relocating to Washington, she earned two degrees at the University of Washington, including a Bachelor of Arts in Social Welfare and a Masters degree in Educational Psychology.  Professional background  Following her graduation from the AADA, Owen moved back to New York City, this time to Greenwich Village, where she sewed costumes for school performances and local dance troupes. In 1947, she worked with Roxanne Marden designing costumes for Columbia University's performance of Lion About Dance, which was part of the Modern Dance Recital presented by the Philolexian Society at the Brander Matthews Theater.http://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/cgi- bin/columbia?a=d&d;=cs19471118-01.2.13&srpos;=&dliv;=none&st;=1&e;=-------en-20 --1741--txt-IN-swimming--- In 1953, she served as the costume designer for Fred Berk's Merry-Go-Rounders Dance Company's dance production of Holiday in Israel which was performed at the Teresa L. Kaufman Auditorium in New York City.dancenotation.org/catalog/EditDanceDetails.aspx?DanceID=81 She spent two summers working in summer stock theatre in Orange, New Jersey. She also appeared in the Broadway production of As You Like It and toured with the production of Life with Father, in which she portrayed Annie. She appeared in the off-Broadway production of The Year of Pilar. In addition to performing in different theatrical productions, she also directed children's plays for the New York Children's Theatre Company. She appeared in the theatrical adaptation of the film, Aladdin and His Lamp, portraying three different roles, including Alladin, the princess, and the mother. She became known for her work in theatre and dance costume design in New York City. Clients include the Merce Cunningham Dance Company at Black Mountain College, headed by world-renowned dancer and choreographer, Merce Cunningham. Moving from New York to Kennewick, she worked with the Richland Light Opera Company, serving as staging director for several productions, including Victor Herbert's The Red Mill. She has also worked with the Spokane Children's Theatre, where she has facilitated acting workshops for the Children's Theatre Festival, in partnership with the San Francisco Magic Carpet Players. When the family moved from Kennewick to Seattle in 1955, she continued her work in costuming by creating displays for Frederick & Nelson and The Bon March√©. She also joined the writing staff of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, as well as the faculty of Lakeside School, where she taught anthropology and drama. She later joined the staff at the University of Washington School of Drama, serving as associate professor.  Legislative advocacy  In 1978, Owen established the Washington Advocates for the Mentally Ill (WAMI), which advocates for families and individuals facing mental health crises. The following year, she co-founded the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), which provides support, education, and advocacy at the level, with over 1,200 offices throughout the US, as well as in Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, Canada, and the Virgin Islands. Owen served as the president and executive director of WAMI, now known as NAMI Greater Seattle office from 1978 to 2002. As executive director of NAMI Greater Seattle, Owen was directly involved in advocating for sweeping changes in mental health legislation in Washington State, including a law introduced and passed in the 1970s that allows involuntary confinement and treatment of individuals whose mental illness makes them a grave threat to themselves or others. She drafted the language in RCW 71.05 to include \\"grave disability due to mental illness\\" as criteria for a 72-hour evaluation for Involuntary Treatment. Owen made her presence known during the 1989 legislative session. In the Washington State House of Representatives and Senate, she is known as \\"The Barracuda\\" for her advocacy efforts. In 2002, she ran for election to the 43rd district of the Washington State House of Representatives, but was defeated by Frank Chopp. Undeterred, she remained a key player and advocate on passing a bipartisan, $65 million strategic plan to restructure the strategic plan and priorities of the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services and the State's Mental Health Division. Retired King County Superior Court Judge Janice Niemi recalls Owen as a catalyst in the successful passage of the bill, \\"You can't really pass a comprehensive bill like this without what you might call a 'bulldog', and that was Eleanor.\\"  Honors and awards  * Jefferson Award for Outstanding Community Service (1980, 2000) * President's Volunteer Action Award Nominee (1982 and 1983) * Matrix Table Award from Women in Communications, Inc.

History Fox Kids Italy S.r.l. was originally founded as a subsidiary of Fox Kids Europe N.V. in 2000 to help control the Italian Fox Kids feed. A syndicated Fox Kids analogue block was launched in 2001, airing programmes for a few hours a day. A one-hour-timeshift of Fox Kids would later launch, being one of only 2 Fox Kids timeshift channels in the world (the other being in the United Kingdom). In 2004, as part of a worldwide partnership between Fox Kids Europe, Fox Kids Latin America and ABC Family Worldwide that would rebrand their operations under a single brand name titled Jetix, the company was renamed to Jetix Italia S.r.l. The rebrand began with the syndicated Fox Kids block being renamed to K-2 on October 1, while the channel's rebrand to Jetix happened in March 2005. In May 2005, a sister channel titled GXT launched, which focused on a teenage to young-adult audience. A 1-hour-timeshift of GXT launched on June 1, 2008, exclusively on Sky Italia. On December 8, 2008, Disney made an agreement to increase ownership in Jetix Italy's parent company Jetix Europe to 96%, and eventually purchased the remainder of the company and had them delisted from Euronext. After this buyout, Disney confirmed that most of the Jetix channels would be rebranded under the Disney XD brand umbrella, including the Italian channel and its timeshift, leaving out GXT and K2 in the process. During the rebrand, Jetix Italy S.r.l., purchased the Italian Jetix network, renamed itself as Switchover Media and agreed to control Jetix Italy and its timeshift until the Disney XD rebrand, in-which the channel would then be placed under control of Disney. Switchover fully purchased K-2 and GXT from Jetix Europe in June 2009, with K-2 eventually launching as its own free-to-air channel on June 15, 2009. In June 2010, Switchover launched a channel aimed at a young male audience, titled Frisbee, which was broadcast on Sky Italia and Digital terrestrial television. In 2012, Switchover moved out of the youth market with the launch of two specialized adult skewing channels. On May 14, the company launched Giallo, a female focused channel with crime drama, thrillers and whodunits programming from the US and Europe. In the Summer, the company under an agreement with Gruner+Jahr/Mondadori launched Focus on Italian digital terrestrial television, based on the popular science magazine of the same name. The channel is aimed at a male audience and factual based programming. In January 2013, Switchover was acquired by Discovery Communications.

Cooper likely received his promotion to Lieutenant Colonel in October, as he subsequently reported on 1 November 1917 as a lieutenant colonel assigned to Camp Dodge, Iowa as Chief of Staff under Colonel Lincoln, and tasked with division infantry training on machine guns. Camp Dodge was a military draft camp created in response to World War I, the entirety of which became activated as the first 88th Infantry Division (United States). Cooper's orders were officially updated to the 88th Division, Infantry, 28 November 1917. On August 5, 1918, Cooper assumed duties as Commandant, 2nd Corps Schools, Chatillon France. The 2nd Corps Schools were established on 4 February 1918 to deliver specialized training in modern warfare to select officers and NCOs, following the harsh experiences of U.S. troops on World War I battlefields where tactics and technologies from the Banana Wars proved ineffective. The 2nd Corps Schools included an Artillery School, Infantry Weapons' School, Engineering School, Field Officer's School, Gas School, Signal School, Sanitary School, Tactical School, and an Aeronautical School. The roots of TRADOC reach back to this era, a revolutionary period of change in both military doctrine and readiness for the United States as expeditionary capabilities evolved from pack-animal warfare to mechanized warfare. For his exceptional service during this critical time, Cooper was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal,Military Times Archives and received the following citation: :The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Army Distinguished Service Medal to Colonel (Infantry) Harry L. Cooper, United States Army, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished services to the Government of the United States, in a duty of great responsibility during World War I. Colonel Cooper commanded the 2d Army Corps School at Chatillon, France, from 15 August 1918 to 19 May 1919. He so organized and coordinated the various activities at these schools that 1,800 to 2,500 students were constantly undergoing instruction. He was primarily responsible for the excellent system of training given, which training as received at these schools exercised a strong influence toward the efficiency of the whole body of American troops in France. By his sound administrative and superior technical ability, untiring zeal, and splendid judgment in reorganizing and expanding the schools, he produced and organization of the highest efficiency. He rendered services of signal worth to the American Expeditionary Forces in a position of great responsibility. :General Orders: War Department, General Orders No. 4 (1923) :Action Date: August 15, 1918 ‚Äì May 19, 1919 :Service: Army :Rank: Colonel :Company: Commanding Officer After his return to the United States from France, in 1920 Cooper and his family lived in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

History The saga of Sarada Vilas Educational Institutions began in the year 1861 when His Highness Mummadi Sri Krishnaraja Wodeyar, the then ruler of Mysore state, directed his courtman Rao Bahadur Sri Bhakshi Narasappa to start an Educational Institution in Mysore so as to make the town a Centre for Education. In keeping with the desire of the king, Sri Narasappa founded a school and named it Sarada Vilas Anglo-Sanskrit School. In the beginning it was housed in a temple and later shifted to Lansdowne building. In 1899, the king formed a Governing Body to manage the affairs of the school. Sri M. Venkatakrishnaiah, popularly called Tataiah, was named the Secretary. He was mainly instrumental in developing the Institution. In 1904, the school was shifted to the Lansdowne building. The High school section was started in 1917 which was shifted to its own building in 1931. In 1945, the Institution started an Intermediate College with Sri M.S. Ramaswamy as Founder Principal. In the year 1952, it was upgraded and began to offer the B.Sc course. The Institution expanded its activities further by starting law college in 1954, Girls High School in 1961, Teachers College in 1963 and Pharmacy College in 1992.

She was designed for use against piracy on the trade routes to Spain, Portugal, and West Africa and to accompany whalers to Greenland. Named in honor of Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I, she was put into service in 1668 and scrapped in 1705 after 34 major missions. She was probably identical with the Wapen von Hamburg, which went into service shortly after her. Background Chamber of Commerce In the 17th century, Hamburg was an important coastal town, well fortified but an attractive target to pirates. Particularly troubled by the corsairs of the Barbary Coast, and following the loss in June 1622 of eight fully laden cargo ships, the city determined that it needed to create a fleet of armed convoy ships to protect its interests, escorting merchant and other vessels. The plans for the construction of Leopoldus Primus and the probably largely identical Wapen von Hamburg started in 1663. The first mention of these plans can be found in the Minutes of the Admiralty of 4 June 1663.Baasch, S. 134 While previously they had relied for protection on converted merchant ships, Hamburg now looked to full-fledged warships. On 23 September, the council proposed to build two frigates, and the citizenry voted to enact the plan. Not much is known about the construction of the Leopoldus Primus. Construction was delayed for unknown reasons, and for several years there were debates about who should take charge of funding the ships, but construction finally began, led by an unknown Dutch ship-master, in 1667. Builders of the period were secretive, so plans were not recorded or shared. The Hamburg sculptor Christian Precht, also known for his work in churches, was hired to create a representation of Leopold I for the stern. This figure is now on display at the Museum of Hamburg History. The naming of such an important vessel after a strict Catholic Emperor in distant Vienna for a city like Hamburg, Lutheran and uninterested in imperial affairs, was quite unusual. A handwritten contemporary poem suggests that the ship was named for the association of Leopold with military success, perhaps against the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Saint Gotthard. The ship was operational in 1668, at some point between April and September. Her first captain was Leopoldus M. Dreyer. Construction, equipment and crew A 19th century representation of the cross section of the Leopoldus Primus Stern figure of Leopold I, by Christian Precht There are few records describing the size and appearance of Leopoldus Primus or her sister ship, Wapen von Hamburg. Dimensions are unknown. What is known is that the ship was built on the model of leading Dutch design. Wolfgang Quinger, in Wappen von Hamburg I (1980), suggests that the pair may have been more or less replicas of the Dutch ship Aemilia. If this is so, Leopoldus Primus would have had a length of about and a width of almost . To get over the shoals in the river Elbe, the hull was probably built after the \\"Rotterdam form\\". The ship was elaborately decorated with Baroque carvings and sculptures. The Leopoldus had 54 guns. The heaviest caliber were on the lower gun deck with the lighter on the upper aft decks. When the ship was docked for a length time in Hamburg, the guns could be unloaded and moved to the ramparts of the city to protect it, as was done during a Danish attack on Hamburg in 1686. Leopoldus Primus had a crew, depending on length and purpose of travel, from around 150 to 250 men, of which about 15 to 20 were officers, including the captain and his lieutenant as well as ministers and the commander of the soldiers. The crew was not stable, but employed for the duration of the trip. Voluntary recruits rather than being pressed into service, they were expected to equip themselves, and more died from diseases caused by unclean conditions on the ship than from battle, at as high a rate as four to one. The 40 to 60 soldiers aboard were better trained and disciplined, taken from the ranks of the city's soldiery or reassigned from other convoy ships. Operations and decommissioning The success of Leopoldus Primus is supported by many reports. Captain Berend Jacobsen Karpfanger took her through a number of successful battles against pirates. One highlight is Karpfanger's defense against five French ships in the Elbe estuary on 11 September 1678. Fifty whaling ships were returning to Hamburg from Greenland when the frigates attacked. After a 12-hour battle, two of the French frigates were sunk and the rest put to flight. None of the Hamburg ships were lost, although Leopoldus Primus sustained slight damages. Only two of the crew of Leopoldus were killed, with one man injured. In other activities, the ship was used in 1686 to protect Hamburg from Denmark. In 1702, Leopoldus Primus was the oldest of the three then existing Hamburg convoy ships when it was badly damaged in a storm. Her captain, Captain Schroeder, had to take port in Falmouth, and it was determined that she was not worth the expense of repair. Schroeder reported this to Hamburg, who rejected a proposal to sell the ship and instead brought her home. There, they determined that if repaired she might continue to sail for another decade. They repaired her at a cost of 3500 marks (1166 pounds) and she was back on the seas, voyaging to Greenland, in 1703. Before her next trip, concerns that she was not seaworthy were raised, and although some felt she could still manage the voyage to England a few more times, others felt the cost of further repairs was a poor risk. Thirty-six years after embarking on her career as the first convoy ship, Leopoldus Primus was taken out of commission. In 1705, she seems to have been scrapped, probably in Hamburg. Overall, Leopoldus Primus undertook 22 trips to the Iberian Peninsula, three trips to England and nine trips to protect whalers to Greenland. Among the convoy ships of Hamburg, she had more missions than any other with the Admiralit√§t von Hamburg, which had 32, as her closest rival.

Selfportrait Xavier Miserachs i Ribalta (; July 12, 1937 ‚Äì August 14, 1998) was a Catalan photographer. He studied medicine at the University of Barcelona, but left school to be a photographer. He exhibited his work in Barcelona from 1956. His work is reminiscent of neorealism and is representative of the years of Spanish economic recovery, 1950-1960. His photographs show him as a creator of a new image of the city and its people. In 1998 he received the Creu de Sant Jordi of the Catalan government.  Biography  Miserachs was born in Barcelona on July 12, 1937, in the middle of the Spanish Civil War. He was the son of a hematologist and a librarian, Manuel Miserachs and Montserrat Ribalta. He discovered photography at the Technical Institute of Santa Eul√†lia, in Barcelona, where he met Ramon Fabregat and his brother Antonio. He studied four courses of a career in medicine, but left shortly before the end to embark on a career as a professional photographer. In 1952, he became a member of the Photographic Association of Catalonia (Agrupaci√≥ Fotogr√†fica de Catalunya), where he became friends with Oriol Maspons. He first exhibited at the headquarters of the Photographic Association of Catalonia in 1957, along with Ricard Terr√© and Ramon Masats. In 1959 they presented work together again in the Sala Aixel√† of Barcelona. He began his professional career in 1959, when Xavier Busquets commissioned him to guide Picasso in his drawings of the facade of the College of Architects of Catalonia. In 1961, after returning from military service, Miserachs wanted independence, and set up his first studio in Casa David at Carrer Tuset in Barcelona. He began photographing on request and for book authors with his work appearing in books such as Barcelona Blanc i Negre (with 400 photographs recounting the war in Barcelona) and Costa Brava Show. During the 1960s he also served as a news reporter for Spanish magazines. In 1968 he signed an exclusive contract with the Revista Triunfo. He also published several articles in La Vanguardia, Gaceta Ilustrada, Intervi√∫, Bazaar and Magazin. He was thus able to witness such historic events as May 68, Swinging London and Prague Spring. Miserachs engaged mainly in editorial photography but also did work doing reports. In January 1967 he co-founded the Escola Eina, where he was one of the first professors of photography. He occasionally frequented Boccaccio's, then the meeting place par excellence of the gauche divine. In 1997 he published his memoir, contact sheets, which won a Gaziel prize. Miserachs died on August 14, 1998, aged 61, in the Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol in Badalona from lung cancer.  Works   Features  Miserachs was the youngest member of a group of photographers led by Francesc Catal√†-Roca. The group's other members were: Oriol Maspons, Ricard Terr√©, Paco Onta√±√≥n, Leopold Pom√©s, and Ramon Masats. At the time, the only photography magazine was Arte Fotografico, founded by the Ignacio Barcel√≥ in 1952, which featured mostly amateur photography. It was announced that Josep M. Casademont would assume the role of promoter between the theoretical and Catalan photographers. In 1963 he published his own magazine, Image and Sound, taking the same direction of Sala Aixel√† of Barcelona. Here, Casademont describes the group's work as neorealist: His publication in Barcelona, Blanc y Negre, in 1964, was a significant event in Miserachs's career. The book also looked upon the sour and chaotic urban world as they complete the visions of Barcelona (Wolfgang Weber, 1929 and Catal√†-Roca, 1954), and went beyond charming and picturesque character, conveying a new sensitivity. Films Miserachs had a brief foray with film, making underground movie shots with some of his friends Enrique Vila-Matas, Emma Cohen and Jordi Cadena. Later he directed and produced his own short film, Am√©n historieta muda (Amen dumb cartoon.) He made the film still from Juguetes rotos, directed by Manuel Summers, in 1966.  Legacy   Memorials  In 2001 the first Xavier Miserachs Photography Award was held in Barcelona, a black and white photography contest named after the author for his work in Barcelona Blanc i Negre. In 1998 the town of Palafrugell named a route between the beaches of Calella de Palafrugell and Llafranc after Miserachs. The Biennial of Photography Xavier Miserachs, dedicated to documentary photography, is also held in Palafrugell. In the biennials of 1999, 2004, 2008 and 2010 exhibitions were held of Miserachs' work. The exhibition hall on the ground floor of the Palace of the Viceroy's wife in Barcelona was, between December 17, 1998 and 2010, named in honour of Miserachs. In 2010, Xavier Sala Miserachs moved to the old Hall of Numismatics, and the ground floor was renamed Virreina Lab. Archive Miserachs' archive includes approximately 60,000 negatives, 20,000 slides, 2,500 contact sheets, notebooks with personal notes, administrative documentation, and part of his personal library. Since 2011 it has been housed in the Research and Documentation Center Museum of Contemporary Art in Barcelona.  Books  He published several photo books, most with text in Catalan or Spanish. { !Year !Original Naming !Text by !Description !Publisher !Ref. |------ |1964 Barcelona, blanc i negre Josep Maria Espin√†s Aym√† ----- |-bgcolor=\\"#EFEFEF\\" |1966 |Costa Brava show |Manuel V√°zquez i Peter Coughtry Kair√≥s ----- |1966 |Conversaciones en Catalu√±a |Salvador P√†niker |Interviews with Josep Pla, Ana Mar√≠a Matute, Josep Maria Gironella, Salvador Espriu, Josep Maria de Porcioles, Antoni T√†pies, Josep Maria Subirachs or Salvador Dal√≠ among others. |Kair√≥s ----- |-bgcolor=\\"#EFEFEF\\" |1967 |Los cachorros |Mario Vargas Llosa Lumen ----- |1967 |El arte prerrom√°nico asturiano |Antonio Bonet Correa Pol√≠grafa ----- |-bgcolor=\\"#EFEFEF\\" |1969 |Conversaciones en Madrid |Salvador P√†niker |Interviews with Camilo Jos√© Cela, Antonio Buero Vallejo, Aranguren, S√°enz de Oiza among others. |Kair√≥s ----- |1978 |Andaluc√≠a Barroca |Antonio Bonet Correa  Pol√≠grafa ----- |-bgcolor=\\"#EFEFEF\\" |1982 |Catalunya des del mar |Carles Barral |Collection Vida i costums dels catalans. |Edicions 62 ----- |1984 |Aprendre a conviure |Josep Maria Espin√†s |Aprende a conviure.

Built in the late 1830s, it was home to one of the region's earliest Lutheran congregations for just a short time before being converted for profane use. Its solid stone construction has made it architecturally important, and it has been named a historic site. One story tall,Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1004. the building is a simple stone structure with a basic gabled roofline; the sides are divided into four bays with windows, while the front has a central entrance with one window on each side., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2013-12-20. Unlike most other stone buildings, constructed of ashlar stone, the church in Casstown is built of rough, comparatively unworked stone. Its roof is of a rare form: the wooden beams supporting the roof form a fuller truss system than in many comparable buildings, and the complex system of pegs and mutually supporting beams enables the roof to stand without any interior load-bearing walls whatsoever. Casstown's first Lutherans organized a church around 1835,The History of Miami County, Ohio. Chicago: Beers, 1880, 397. just four years after the Evangelical Lutheran Joint Synod of Ohio was formed. Composed largely of emigrants from Pennsylvania, the congregation had no church building in its earliest years, so the members worshipped in that of the village's Methodist Episcopal congregation. Construction of the present building began in 1839, and upon its completion in the following year, the Lutherans left the Methodist building and occupied their own edifice. It remained their home for little more than a quarter century, as the congregation erected a larger brick building and moved to it in 1867. Following this time, it was converted into a residence, with two of its more prominent inhabitants being C.R. and Eunice Randall. In 1984, the old church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It qualified for historic designation both because of its architecture and because of its place in the area's history, for it was considered to represent an important stage in the emigration of Pennsylvania Lutherans to western Ohio. One of more than forty National Register sites in Miami County, it is the only one in Casstown.

The church, and its associated hall, is a Grade II listed building. Creation of the parish The Parish of St. Alban was formed at the beginning of 1932, mainly out of the South Stoneham Parish, but at that time there was no St. Alban's church, only a site on which to build it. The land had been part of Swaythling Farm and had been acquired through the foresight of the then Archdeacon of Winchester (Ven. A. E. Daldy). Until the new church was ready worship in the new parish took place in St. Agnes Church, from 1905 to 1933, on Portswood Road and in the Burgess Road Mission which until then had been in Highfield Parish (latterly known as St. Alban's Mission). St. Alban's Church was completed in 1933. The site was large enough for not only for the church but for the vicarage and large halls; the importance of the grouping of the buildings means that they are collectively listed as Grade II on the English Heritage list of protected buildings. Architecture St. Alban's Church was one of the first to be designed by the noted architect Nugent Francis Cachemaille-Day and built by the Southampton builders GE Prince & Sons. A \\"big cruciform church with (a) low, broad central tower,\\"The Buildings of England: Hampshire, page 574 it is on the Latin Cross plan and is late Gothic in style. The traditional outward appearance of the church contains a \\"spacious and well shaped interior\\", with a centralised altar that Pevsner described as \\"original and innovative\\". The east end of the church which would normally have formed the chancel was used as a Lady chapel, while the main altar is sited under the central tower much closer to the congregation - now a common arrangement but present at St. Alban's from the first. Space for a choir, which in churches at this time was generally seated between the congregation and the altar, was to be provided in a western gallery which was never completed due to a lack of funding. St. Alban's was one of the first churches Cachemaille-Day designed and it shows the architect's early exploration of the logic of the Liturgical Movement which would come to a fuller expression in the more obviously radical designs of later churches, for example St. Michael's, Northenden. The east window The east window is by Christopher Webb (1886‚Äì1966), one of the most important stained-glass artists of the mid twentieth century, whose other work in Hampshire includes the east window of the Bishop's Chapel at Wolvesey Palace. The main figures in the window represent Christ flanked on the left by Virgin Mary and St. Boniface, and on the right by St. Alban and St. Wilfrid. The glass was the gift of Mrs F. Watkins in memory of her husband.

It has been created since 2002 by Dott. Marco Verdecchia, Barbara Tomassetti and Erika Coppola. One of the main characteristic of CHyM model is the extensive use of Cellular Automata (CA) based algorithms for drainage network extraction and rainfall data assimilation, for what concerns the specific application in CHyM code, see Coppola et al., 2007. ChyM can simulate the hydrological cycle in any geographical domain with any resolution up to 90 meters; drainage network is extracted by a native algorithm implemented in CHyM code, as a consequence no commercial software (like GIS) are needed to run the model. The main aim of CHyM is to provide a general purpose tool for flood alert mapping and hydrological risk management; characteristics of the model also allow to carry out long term simulation to investigate possible changes in hydrological cycle induced by climatic change. CHyM can assimilate different sets of precipitation data merging them in a hierarchical way at each hourly time step, these precipitation data can be obtained from raingauges observations, radar and satellite estimations and meteorological or climatic Limited Area Model (LAM). CHyM code is written using standard fortran language and the source code is provided by the authors for free to all no- profit institution for any kind of scientific application.

The same year saw the organization of the township's first church, a New Light congregation, but it was 1815 before a Methodist class was formed in Troy as the city's first church. Presbyterian worship services began in 1818, led by missionary minister George Burgess; most services were held in the schoolhouse, although occasional services were held in the courthouse. A rude building served as the house of worship from 1826 until 1837, when the congregation divided: both sides of the Old School-New School Controversy were represented in the membership, and instead of fighting to retain the property, the two sides chose to sell the building and divide the proceeds. Although the New School congregation built a wooden church building in 1839, they commenced construction on the present building in 1859, and while the sanctuary was dedicated in late 1860,Owen, Lorrie K., ed.

At some point in 1863 or 1864, the two congregations chose to reunite, despite the remaining division between the Old and New School denominations on the national level, which was only resolved in 1870. Architecture First Presbyterian Church is a brick building with stone elements, set on a stone foundation. Constructed by George R. Browning, its style is the Romanesque Revival and represents some of the best pre-Civil War architecture extant in Troy. The large sanctuary is simple, typical of traditional Presbyterianism, and its design demonstrates Browning's unusually high degree of skill. The overall plan is rectangular, although a tall flat- roofed tower sits at the front of the building, with an arched doorway set in its base and battlements at the top. Large arched windows, taller than the door, are placed on two levels of the tower, with an oculus between the levels on each side. Yet taller arch windows, nearly twice the height of the doors, are placed in the front (one on each side of the tower) and sides (six on each) of the building. The ends of the building rise to gables, which on the front is highlighted by a pediment behind the tower., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2010-02-14.

The farm, which is mentioned in records from the Middle Ages, is called Lj√∏godt from Ljo√∞gata (Old Norse for \\"main track\\"); another nearby farm, also mentioned in medieval sources, is called Haugen (from Old Norse haugr \\"hill; mound\\") after the mound.Rakni‚Äôs Mound and its Surrounding Cultural Landscape, Rakni's Mound, Akershus Kulturnett. The great mound was surrounded by smaller, later burials until the early twentieth century; aerial photographs show the outlines of more than 30 now effaced mounds, and archaeological digs have dated burials between the 7th century and the Viking Age. They were mostly simple cremations with few grave goods,For example an early Viking Age cremation burial uncovered in May 2009, which included fragments of a bone comb: Anne Ekornholmen, \\"Kull og menneskebein fra tidlig vikingtid\\", Romerikes Blad 13 June 2009 and three are in the trench around the mound itself. Construction The mound was raised over three cone-shaped layers of approximately 75,000 stacked logs from 30,000 trees, on which were heaped some 80,000 cubic metres of sand taken from trenches around the mound, clay and soil.Collegium medievale 14 (2001) p. 46 Wilson, p. 146 states 125,000 logs.

The construction has been estimated to have required the work of 40-50 people felling trees the winter before the mound was built, followed by 450-600 over the summer to build it;\\"Det meste av Raknehaugen blev bygget p√• en sommer\\", Aftenposten 4 June 1941, p. 2 Online archive, subscription required. or 160-200 men working for 150 days. The trees were quite homogeneous, none over 60 years old, and had been grown in open woodland, providing the first evidence of large-scale forestry in Iron Age Scandinavia. Traces of ancient agriculture and cooking pits, which predate the mound, lie under it. A layer of coal with animal bones and cremated human skull fragments from an individual between 20 and 35 years old were found at the base of the mound. No grave goods have been found, only a couple of wooden spades and a bar, presumably from the construction of the mound. Archaeological investigations 1869-1870 The first dig at the site was conducted by amateur archaeologist Anders Lund Lorange (1847-1888) over two seasons during the years 1869-70. He reached the bottom of the mound but was unsuccessful in finding a burial chamber; he did find the remains of a horse. He left a letter to future archaeologists in a sealed bottle in his second shaft, together with silver coins and two bottles of beer. Lorange‚Äôs Excavation in 1869-70 and the Message in a Bottle, Raknehaugen, Akershus Kulturnett. He believed the mound to be a Viking Age burial. 1939-1940 Archeologist Sigurd Grieg (1894‚Äì1973) conducted an extensive investigation of the mound beginning in summer 1939. He found the carbon layer and the bone fragments and believed it to be from the Migration Age, which newer dating techniques later proved correct. There was great interest in the excavation; seats were built for the public to watch. In the first season, the top layer of logs were laid bare and samples taken. Shafts were dug into the mound in two directions, named the 'East Front' and 'West Front' in view of the wartime situation.Grieg‚Äôs Excavations During the Second World War, Raknehaugen, Akershus Kulturnett. Before work could resume at the site, Norway had been occupied by Nazi Germany.

Grieg had promised to restore the mound as it had looked before being opened. Work began in 1946 using wartime traitors and took until 1948 to complete; however, locals protested that the mound remained at least 4 metres lower than it had been. It was reconstructed again in the mid-1960s.\\"Raknehaugen er n√• halvveis restaurert, ferdig om ett √•r\\", Aftenposten 20 August 1965, p. 3 Online archive, subscription required. 1993 Dagfinn Skre, professor in the Museum of Cultural History at the University of Oslo, reopened one of Grieg's smaller shafts to re-investigate the mound. This investigation confirmed the identification of the traces at its base as remains of prehistoric agriculture and of cooking pits, possibly from ritual meals. Analysis of pollen from the lake showed that the area has been under cultivation since approximately 2000 BCE, intensively and continuously since approximately 700 BCE (the later Bronze Age). After re- examination of Grieg's notes, Skre concluded in 1997 that the mound had contained a cremation burial and had not been merely a cenotaph or thing- place.\\"Nytt forskerlys p√• Raknehaugen\\", Aftenposten 12 September 1993, p. 13 Online archive, subscription required. Uses since the 19th century Early in the 19th century, the mound was acquired by the regional magistrate, Johan Koren (1758-1825), and his wife, journalist Christiane Koren (1764-1815). In 1808-1809, they built a large hexagonal stone pavilion on the top as a memorial to their son Wilhelm, who died of cholera aged 18.The Story of \\"Wilhelmsminde‚Äù, Raknehaugen, Akershus Kulturnett.

It was demolished around 1850; before the first excavation of the mound in 1869, the stones had been cleared away and used in building a cowshed.The Myth of King Rakni, Raknehaugen, Akershus Kulturnett. The Korens were members of the circle around the Norwegian Society and the mound appears as an inspiring monument in poetry and other writings of the period. In the 20th century, the mound was sometimes the site of celebrations of Olsok, Midsummer and Norwegian Constitution Day (17 May), especially in the period of Norway's becoming independent of Sweden. In the first decade of the 21st century it was also for a while the site of ceremonies by the neo-Nazi group Vigrid.Knut Nadheim, \\"‚Äì Ingen vekst i nynazismen\\", Romerikes Blad 16 September 2008 Association with King Rakni Rakni occurs as a sea-king in skaldic poetry and the Prose Edda. The name may be the same as Ragnar. In 1743, Circuit Judge Jochum Werner reported that the mound was supposed to be the burial place of \\"King Ragnvold\\": \\"There are in Hovin annex, estate of Ullensaker Parish, the Houg Farm, a mighty height of Sand and soil. Old people say that King Ragnvold is buried there. Therefore, it is called Ragnvold‚Äôs Height.\\"The Myth of King Rakni; original Norwegian at Bjarne Gaut, Sagnet om Kong Rakne: \\"Der finnes udi Hovind Annex til Ullensager Prestegjeld, under Gaarden Houg, en m√¶ktig stor H√∏jd af Sand og Jord opkastet, hvor, for vist af gamle Folk siges at skulle v√¶re begraven Kong Rangvold; derfor samme kaldes Rangvolds H√∏jd.\\" In a diary entry dated 29 June 1808, Christiane Koren said the king buried there was called Rakni, that the lake was supposedly created by the digging of material to make the mound, and that her kitchen-maid and another girl of similar age saw a \\"large black man\\" at the mound one night, apparently the king, insulted by his barrow being dug into and a building built on top.Gaut, Sagnet om Kong Rakne: \\"Der var engang en Konge, han hedde Rakne, og boede, siger Sagnet, her p√• Hovind og ligger begravet i den store H√∏y, som efter ham er kaldt Rakneh√∏yen . . . .

Plantning o.s.v. over hans Hoved.\\" Lorange was told by locals that the king had been buried in a stone chamber between two white horses, with logs piled on each other above. In fact he did find the remains of a horse, which gave off such a stench that it was still remembered in the 1940s and 1950s. However, the horse was above the top layer of logs, not below, and the story that a worker died from the smell was probably inspired by the reports about the excavation of Tutankhamun's tomb. The stone chamber may have been inspired by the pavilion built on the mound by Johan Koren. In 1927, Jan Petersen wrote that there was a legend in the village that King Rakni was buried in the mound in full armour, with a white horse, after being killed in a battle in the 7th century, and that warriors were buried in smaller mounds surrounding his; there were in fact originally many small mounds around the large one.

For example, possession of sector \\"N\\" plots has not been given to allottees despite the fact that full payment was received in February 2013 against promise of possession to be given by June 2013.

Accordingly, land was chosen on Xenia Avenue at the Allen Street intersection in one of the city's eastern neighborhoods, and the owner donated enough property to permit the construction of a church, rectory, and school. Archbishop Purcell of Cincinnati laid the cornerstone in April 1859, and the finished building was consecrated by Purcell and Henry Damian Juncker, the Bishop of Alton, in August of the following year. The building measured , but by the opening years of the twentieth century, the parish had outgrown it, and construction began on a new building; Archbishop Moeller laid the cornerstone in July 1905 and consecrated it in November 1906.

Above the main part of the facade is a pediment, and a belfry crowns the building. History Organic Chesterville's first church was a Primitive Baptist congregation, which was organized in 1816. The first Methodists in the vicinity of the present village gathered under the preaching of itinerant preachers in the late 1820s, and the first Methodist sermon in Chesterville itself was preached in 1833 by a minister who stayed overnight in the village while travelling from Mansfield to Columbus. A class was formed soon afterward, worshipping in an old schoolhouse, and the first minister was a Rev. McDowell. The congregation's earliest extant records date from July 1836. One year later, the first church building was erected at a cost of $1,200 in addition to $150 for the land. The congregation continued worshipping at this property until late 1850; they sold it in 1849 for $350 while retaining the right to use it for a year, and in later years, the building was converted into a school. The present church building was erected in 1851 at a cost of several thousand dollars; it was several years before the congregation struggled out of debt, but in the end they secured a building suitable for their own purposes for many generations. Lying behind the church building is a cemetery, which was established circa 1837. Although the Baptists lasted for many years, and although a PCUSA congregation was formed in Chesterville in 1845,Baughman, Abraham J., and Robert Franklin Bartlett.

Community Chesterville's earliest years, late in the first half of the nineteenth century, were highly prosperous; numerous private schools and a prominent textile manufacturing company were established there. Its decline began in the late 1840s: several area communities united to fight for the creation of a separate county but fought each other for the title of county seat, and when Mount Gilead was chosen for this position instead of Chesterville, the town stagnated as both government and railroads concentrated on Mount Gilead. This combination of early prosperity and later stagnation is responsible for the present existence of the Methodist Church and numerous other Greek Revival buildings in the village: a building boom occurred early in its history, and neither finances nor necessity permitted the construction of newer buildings in later years. Preservation During the 1970s, a community group known as Chester Community Concerns was formed to encourage preservation of the village's historic architecture. In 1978, the group sponsored a project to record the village's historic buildings with the Ohio Historic Inventory, a historic preservation survey, with the goal of nominating the most important historic properties for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. Using the multiple property submission process, nine Chesterville buildings were added to the Register in August 1979: the Chester Township Hall, the Methodist Church, the Jarvis and Enos Miles Houses on Portland Street, the Old Union School, the Post Office and the A.B. Sears House on Sandusky Street, and the Old Bartlett and Goble Store and a Wood Commercial Building at the village's main intersection. The Methodist Church qualified both because of its well-preserved historic architecture and because of its place in local history: it was deemed the village's most important architectural landmark, and its location on State Route 95 on the village's east side makes it one of the village's most prominent buildings, contributing greatly to Chesterville's continued appearance as a nineteenth- century trading center.

The parish is now staffed by the clergy of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Columbus. History In the spring of 1819, Fr. Nicholas Young celebrated the first private Mass in Zanesville in the upstairs at the Green Tree Tavern owned by John Dugan. In November 1820, Dugan purchased a brick warehouse for public Masses, renaming it Trinity Church. When the parish outgrew the converted warehouse, Dugan purchased the lot on which St. Thomas Church is now constructed. To be named St. John Church, the cruciform building‚Äôs cornerstone was laid on March 4, 1825. Dugan died in Maryland while escorting Bishop Edward Fenwick, Fr. Young, and Fr. Gabriel Richard. His grave under St. Thomas Aquinas Church is marked with a cross on the floor. During the 1840s, the congregation outgrew St. John Church and needed a new building. Zanesville‚Äôs Protestant community contributed funding; local Quaker, John Howard, donated stone from his property. St. John Church was demolished and the cornerstone for St. Thomas Aquinas Church was laid on March 17, 1842. Construction costs for the English Gothic structure was $40,000. The first Mass was celebrated on Christmas 1842. On June 16, 1912, a tornado collapsed the church steeple into the nave during morning Mass, killing three people and injuring twenty-eight. The next year, the Muskingum River flooded, further damaging the church. The parish raised approximately $25,000 to repair the building. The parish ordered new pictorial stained glass windows from Joseph Osterrath of Li√®ge, Belgium in 1914, but order fulfillment was delayed until after the end of World War I. Indefinite Closure Structural engineers inspected the church attic on February 26, 2020 and discovered cracks in the wood trusses. As a result, the Mid-East Ohio Building Department condemned the building until repairs could be made. The parish adopted a plan to prevent further damage via shoring, repair the damaged timbers using steel structural channels, and make necessary cosmetic repairs. After starting the project on April 6, the work crew discovered asbestos fiberboard insulation which was likely installed in the 1920s or 1930s. The requisite asbestos removal delayed the shoring effort until at least May 1.

However, the history of Harriettsville began far later, for Moses T. Spencer platted it in 1839. Among the earliest settlers were a pair of Frenchmen, while numerous Germans were among the small village's population by the late 1880s. The first clergy in modern-day Noble County were itinerant ministers of the Methodist Episcopal Church; preachers from other denominations were equally as active as the Methodists, but less numerous. Harriettsville's first church, predating the community itself, was a small group of Methodists formed in 1832. In contrast, St. Henry's Church was organized only in 1868, but a small frame building was completed in the same year, while the earliest Methodist church building was erected in 1869. This pioneer building measured and cost $1,800; it was built largely by the donation of one man, William Smithberger. No longer did the village's Catholics need to await occasional visits from the priest at Immaculate Conception Church in Fulda in order to hear Mass. Virtually all of the members in the early decades were Germans or of German descent. A parish school was formed in the late 1870s, and in its first twenty years, the parish grew fourfold in membership. This growth caused the original church building to be too small: land for a new building was purchased in 1879,Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2.

Architecture Road Fork, a typical local church St. Henry's Church is a stone building in the Gothic Revival style; the most prominent component is a multi-story tower on one side of the facade. Small windows pierce the walls of the tower, the main section of which is topped by a louvered belfry. Crowning the entire tower is a tall spire topped with a cross, while space for large clocks is left unoccupied between the spire and the belfry. The primary portion of the church is a simpler rectangular structure; the shingled roof rises to a prominent gable at the front of the building., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2014-01-02. Sitting next to the church is a small frame rectory with gabled roof, built in the late nineteenth century. Rather than hiring a local architect, the parishioners chose Chicago architect Adolphus Druiding to design their new church at the end of the nineteenth century. One of Ohio's most rural areas, Noble County possesses a built environment consisting primarily of traditional vernacular buildings, rather than the high style and professional craftsmanship that the church exemplifies. Moreover, very few stone buildings are found anywhere in the county, and Harriettsville has no other stone buildings at all. Historic site In 1982, the church and rectory were listed together on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of their historically significant architecture and because of their important place in the area's history. The property is one of nine Noble County locations on the National Register; among the others is Immaculate Conception Church in Fulda, which supported Harriettsville's Catholics before St. Henry parish was formed.

However, the history of Fulda began far later, for Charles Burlingame platted it in 1861. By the late 1880s, numerous Germans were among the small village's population. The first clergy in modern-day Noble County were itinerant ministers of the Methodist Episcopal Church; preachers from other denominations were equally as active as the Methodists, but less numerous. Harriettsville's first church, predating the community itself, was a small group of Methodists. Immaculate Conception Church was organized about 1840, seven years after the first Germans arrived in the area after migrating from Wheeling, Virginia. No priest came among them until 1840, and until 1849 the ministration of the sacraments was rare. A priest from Miltonsburg began making twice-monthly visits in 1849, but the first resident priest was appointed in 1858. Although he stayed only two years, his successor D.J. Kluber served the parish from 1860 until 1883, exerting immense influence over the parish, and the members saw him as being largely responsible for the parish's growth and stability. Construction began on a small church building under the ministry of the priest from Miltonsburg, and Archbishop Purcell of Cincinnati dedicated it in 1853. Ten years later, the parishioners constructed a parish school, and a rectory followed in 1866; its large size and pretentious architecture resulted in a high construction cost of $2,500. By this time, the original church building had become entirely inadequate for the needs of the congregation, and replacement plans were laid; the cornerstone was laid in May 1874, and Bishop Rosecrans of Columbus dedicated it in August of the following year. Architecture Built of brick, Immaculate Conception is a Romanesque Revival structure with a gabled front divided into three bays. Each of the side bays is pierced by an entrance with fanlight and a window above, while the tower projecting from the center bay includes two oculi and an arched window above its doorway. A belfry with louvering is placed within the tower in the small space between the roofline of the rest of the building and the top of the tower. Unlike the bays in the facade, the side bays are almost totally occupied by large Romanesque windows, while a cornice of miniature arches sits under the eaves between the brackets., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2014-01-02. Moreover, the interior possesses complexity uncommon in rural Appalachian Ohio, due to components such as a vaulted ceiling, polychromy, and a grand high altar. The church's dedication to the Virgin prompts its primary paint color to be a light blue, although rose and gold are extensively used as a reference to Christ the King. Outside, the church is the primary component of Fulda's built environment: its location on a hilltop highlights the west-facing building's architecture, which is of far grander style than any other building in the community.Owen, Lorrie K., ed.

It was built in the 10th century on the site of a presumed Mithraeum. A grant was made to bishop Sinibaldo of this church in 1123, which had already been in construction. The Romanesque stone and brick facade was constructed from 1106 to 1127, but the semicircular apse may date from earlier. The interior is now relatively bare. History Tradition is that the church was founded by St. Prosdocimus on the ruins of a temple dedicated to Apollo. The first document in which is mentioned the church is dated February 19, 1123: the bishop Sinibaldo of Padua intervened to urge the completion work of the church, which had started at least from 1109, and had suffered from the earthquake of 1117.Chiesa di Santa Sofia (Padova), Italian Wikipedia Numerous archaeological finds from the site date to between the second and fourth centuries). The apse is suspected to date to the 9th century, during the Carolingian age, based on the crypt, which is within 50 years as the nave of the Basilica of San Marco, using radiocarbon methods Primary construction of the present apse was between 1070 and 1106. The second phase opened in 1117 and ended in about 1170. The structure underwent embellishment near the end of the fourteenth century to meet the liturgical reforms approved by the Council of Trent. A seventeen-year-old Andrea Mantegna painted his first independent work for this church, an altarpiece depicting Madonna with Child in conversation with saints. It was dismembered in the seventeenth century. Initially operated by Augustinians monks, the church was granted to Benedictine nuns by 1517. In the sixteenth century it was a parish church. It became a provostry, which depended the church of San Gaetano, the church of Paolotti, Matthias Church and the church of San Biagio. The nuns were expelled during the Napolenoic rule of Veneto in 1806‚Äì1810, and the convent became state ownership. Between 1951 and 1958, the structure underwent a major restoration work aiming to restore primitive appearance of the church. This effort stripped the church of the Mannerist and Baroque accretions, but has left the church interior much less decorated. Recently the nave was again subject to important conservation work and cleaning the walls The church has returned to become a parish church governed by secular clergy of the diocese of Padua. Until 1957, the church had the incorruptible bodies of the Blessed Beatrice I Este (from 1578) and of the blessed Elena Enselmini, this last was moved here from the church of the Blessed Elena in 1810 Exterior Italy, Veneto, Padua, church of Santa Sofia, apse (particular) The church, as typical for Romanesque churches, is oriented with an apse to the east and facade facing west. The north range of the upper part of the facade has sunken, due to a failure of the foundation took place around the time of construction. Characterized by niches, blind arcades and hanging arches, it is linked perhaps to the construction site of Torcello and is dated to the first half of the twelfth century. Within certain niches, on the north, there are visible fragments of frescoes of the fourteenth century. The mullioned window at the top is from the twentieth-century restoration while the large oculus is fourteenth century, the result of Bishop Stephen from Carrara to adorn the structure. Along the aisles, simple and unadorned openings from various periods: single and double windows of Romanesque, Gothic and an oculi windows from the sixteenth. The Palladian windows open in the seventeenth century were buffered in the nineteenth century. The early medieval apse, with a blind arches, a gallery, and a large central niche, was reconstructed in 1852. Some scholars have seen in part of a round unfinished, other similarities with the construction of Santa Maria and Donato in Murano. The Romanesque bell tower Gothic, dated 1296, stands adjacent to the apse. Interior Interior of the church of Santa Sofia in Padua. The impressive interior is the result of major restoration in the 1950s. It returned the building to a severe appearance and with harmonious embellishments previously distorted by the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The pillars and columns support the many arches that lead to the apse. The plastered roof vaults date from the late fourteenth century renovation of Bishop Stephen from Carrara. The aisles end in a sort of ambulatory, interrupted by the large niche at the top of the apse, where the tabernacle was placed. The columns and capitals alternate with pillars and stone decorations came from a Roman and Byzantine landfill. Along the walls are thirteenth and fourteenth-century frescoes, from the school of Giotto. Entering on the left there is a small lapidary. It follows the altar of the Blessed Beatrice D'Este.

History of Hopewell The Hopewell Associate Reformed Church, now referred to as Historic Hopewell Church, is a landmark on the National Register of Historic Places. It was founded in 1808 by Scotch-Irish Presbyterians who chose to leave their settlement in South Carolina and move to Ohio because of their opposition to slavery. In 1814, Reverend Alexander Porter was appointed as Hopewell's first permanent pastor. As the community grew, the original log church was replaced in 1825 by the brick structure that is the Historic Hopewell Church today. For over 100 years the church and its members were an active congregation, contributing to the settlement of Ohio and leading abolitionist efforts. Hopewell also served as a frequently used stop on the Underground Railroad, providing shelter and worship for slaves who sought freedom. Many members of the church served as conductors on the Underground Railroad. Throughout the 19th-century, the church community grew so large that at various points in its history, daughter churches were formed in the nearby towns of Fairhaven (1835), Oxford (1837), College Corner (1849), and Morning Sun (1879). In 1915, because of the expansion of the four daughter churches, the Hopewell Church was shuttered. Hopewell remained closed until the 1960s when descendants of the original families and other community members began restoration efforts to create the Historic Hopewell Church we have today. Hopewell Today Today, the church is an active community resource and a non-profit organization. More than 150 people are members of the Historic Hopewell Church, helping to fulfill its mission. The Hopewell Church holds Sunday services every summer in cooperation with other area churches. The services are held at 9:30 a.m. from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Dress is casual and all are invited to attend! A special Christmas service is held each year in December. For more information on Hopewell services, please see www.historichopewellchurch.org. The Historic Hopewell Church is also available for rental for weddings, baptism, memorial services, funerals and other events. For more information, please see www.historichopewellchurch.org. Mission Statement To preserve our heritage and to perpetuate the church's care for future generations. To promote the organization by inviting others to join with us to support this worthy goal. To provide a place of interdenominational worship.

It was built in 1875 and added to the National Register in 1977. History In 1834, Father Johann Wilhelm Horstmann and other settlers immigrated from Glandorf, Germany, to Putnam County, Ohio. They acquired a tract of land from the government, and established the town of Glandorf along and the first Catholic church in Putnam County. The church building was a by log cabin that also served as a residence for Father Horstmann. The congregation quickly outgrew the original building and, in 1837, a larger hewn-log church was dedicated to St John the Baptist. Father Horstman died in 1843 and Father Bohne, who took over the parish, began construction of a brick church building. Shortly afterward, the parish put under the control of the Sanguinist Fathers and, in 1848, a convent was established. The current church building was built in 1875 and dedicated in 1878. It was designed by Cudell & Richardson, and it was the largest Roman Catholic church in Ohio at the time. The church is built in the Neo-Gothic style and has a 225-foot spire. It contained \\"figurines from Austria, stained glass windows imported from Munich, Germany, and a highly detailed pulpit which was purchased for $1,400 at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia\\", according to Michael Leach, who wrote a book on the church's history.Leach, Michael E.

Pioneer cemetery, which holds the grave of Father Horstmann, sits beside the church. In 1977, the church was added to the National Register. In 1992, a fire in the church caused $1.2 million worth of damage to the inside. In 2015, the parish opened a museum to display the history of the church and the town of Glandorf. Church restoration Interior In 2017, the church underwent a 3-month restoration and improvement project. The $1.2 million project involved preventive measures such as fiberglassing the interior walls, painting, and installing updated storm windows to protect the stained glass. In addition, a lowered ceiling in the vestibule was removed to uncover a stained glass window. The work was carried out by Conrad Schmitt Studios of New Berlin, Wisconsin.

It takes its name either from the town of Saluzzo, in the province of Cuneo, or from the former Marquisate of Saluzzo, which approximately coincides with its area of distribution. It may also be called the Bianca di Cavour, after the nearby town of Cavour, in the province of Turin. History The Bianca di Saluzzo was once abundant in Piemonte, especially in the historic Marquisate of Saluzzo and in neighbouring comuni such as Cavour, Villafranca and Garzigliana. In the 1960s, industrialisation and intensive agriculture caused a decline in the breed, which is suitable only for free-range management. Recovery began in 1999 under the auspices of the Istituto Professionale per l'Agricoltura e l'Ambiente (professional institute for agriculture and the environment) of Verzuolo, in the province of Cuneo. A breed standard has been submitted to the Federazione Italiana Associazioni Avicole, the federation of Italian poultry associations. Breed numbers remain low. A study published in 2007 used a figure of approximately 700 for the total breeding stock, of which approximately 200 were cocks. Characteristics The Bianca di Saluzzo is white, with yellow skin, legs and ear-lobes. The comb is single and large, with 4‚Äì6 points. Average weight is for cocks, for hens. The eggs are white and weigh approximately 50 g. Uses The Bianca di Saluzzo is a dual-purpose breed. Hens begin to lay at 6‚Äì7 months, and may lay approximately 180 eggs per year.

She along with other colleagues were responsible for the attempted assassination of the king Louis XIV of France in 1679.  Background  Catherine Trianon, was a widow and a professional fortune teller. She was considered to be one of the most important associates of La Voisin, but also a personal friend and confidante. La Trianon managed her business with her partner, La Dodd√©e, who was also her lover in a homosexual relationship. Trianon was described by her colleagues as very well educated. She had a reception room that contained a human skeleton, which was said to be a pious reminder of mortality.  Poison Affair  In 1679, Madame de Montespan commissioned La Voisin to murder King Louis XIV of France.Madame de Montespan and Louis XIV by H Noel Williams It was at the home of Trianon that La Voisin conspired with the help of her lovers, Bertrand and Romani. As a friend, Trianon tried to convince La Voisin to abandon the plan, even making up a horoscope to warn her that it would be a mistake, but did not succeed. The group decided that the King should be poisoned by a petition. On March 5, La Voisin's first attempt at poisoning the King failed; she planned to meet with Trianon on March 12 to plan the next attempt but was arrested before anything conspired. Shortly after Voisons arrest, in the month of May, Trianon was arrested. Upon her arrest, authorities found 25 \\"manuscript volumes on the occult sciences\\" in her house.Grimoires: A History of Magic Books by Owen Davies (Oxford University Press, 2010) In August 1680, after the execution of La Voisin in February, the connection between La Voisin, Montespan, and the plan to assassinate the King was revealed by her daughter, Marguerite Monvoisin, who on October 9 also confirmed the statements made by Adam Lesage in August of child sacrifice at the black masses. After her statements about Montespan and child sacrifice were confirmed by Francoise Filastre on October 1 and Etienne Guibourg on October 10th, Trianon, who had been personally involved in the attempt, also confirmed the statement.

History Community Magnet School was established in 1977. At the time of its founding, it was located on the property of the campus of the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies (LACES) in Mid-City, and it remained there for a period of around 25 years. Before its founding, Mid-City schools had been racially segregated. Several black and Jewish parents decided to establish an alternative school so that the various ethnic groups could more easily interact with one another. After its founding, according to Martha Groves of the Los Angeles Times, \\"the school has gained a reputation for parent involvement and student achievement.\\" For several years, due to the conditions in the existing building, Pamela Marton, the school's principal until the 2010-2011 school year, asked LAUSD to upgrade Community Magnet School's campus. In April of that year, a representative of the United States Department of Education National Blue Ribbon Award committee engaged in a tour of the school, in order to assess whether it is worthy of receiving the National Blue Ribbon award. Groves said that the official \\"was flabbergasted at what Community has accomplished in spite of its inadequate facilities\\" and that in his meetings with LAUSD officials he \\"asked why nothing had been done to improve the situation.\\" In 1999 the school was awarded the Blue Ribbon. It was one of two elementary schools in Los Angeles to receive the award,\\"Community Magnet School .\\" Bel-Air Association. Retrieved on January 15, 2012. and it was the only Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) school to do so during that year. Carol Lynn Mithers, a writer and a parent of a Community magnet student, said in a Los Angeles Times opinion column that, within a month of the exchange with the Department of Education official, \\"word came down\\" that the school would be relocated to a new campus built within a then-unused area within the Walgrove Elementary School campus property in Venice, blocks away from Venice High School. In May the school district officially notified the principal that the move had been proposed. The school community had two weeks to decide whether or not to accept the offer.Groves, Martha. \\"'Blue Ribbon' School's Move Criticized.\\" Los Angeles Times. December 5, 1999. 2. Retrieved on January 15, 2012. LAUSD had not notified Walgrove in a timely manner that the district had been considering moving the Community Magnet School there. The Community school parents were opposed to the move. They argued that it would make serving its students more difficult, since many of the students lived east of the Mid-City location, and the proposed location would be to almost west from its former location. The parents argued that many students would have to spend one hour or more riding on school buses. LACES had a positive reaction to the proposed move, since it could expand and add athletic facilities. Parents at Walgrove had a negative reception to the proposal. Walgrove had been in negotiations with Paul Cummins, the founder of the Crossroads School in Santa Monica, and then the founder of a new private school called New Roads High School, also in Santa Monica. Cummins wanted to develop the New Roads school's new campus on the Walgrove site. He had asked the LAUSD board for months to consider taking a vote on the plan, with no results. Cummins offered to add amenities and cooperative programs in exchange for a short term lease at the Walgrove site for New Roads. The existence of the Community proposal prevented the New Roads proposal from being realized. Residents of the Mid-City were opposed, since the plan would remove the final remaining elementary magnet school. On an earlier occasion, another alternative elementary school, Open Magnet Charter School, had moved from Mid- City to Westchester from Mid-City. In June 1999 the Community school officials met with the LAUSD project manager. The project manager proposed building a new facility would have a $4.2 million budget, so a new campus could be constructed on the site of the Walgrove playground using pre-fabricated modular structures. $1.2 million would originate from Community's pre-existing building repair funds from Proposition BB, a school repair bond passed in 1997. According to the plan, the new campus would have an administration building, a lunch shelter, a multipurpose building, and other features. If Community decided not to go forward with the plan, and LACES commenced building a new academic facility, Community would be ejected from the LACES campus and it would have had to find a new location; the possibility that the new location would be very far away from Mid-City existed. Mithers said that after the proposal was presented, the parent body voted to endorse the plans, \\"[a]mid much grumbling\\". LAUSD proposed that the new campus would open in the northern hemisphere fall of 2000. On Tuesday June 8, 1999, the LAUSD school board approved the plan to relocate the school to Venice.Smith, Doug. \\"Magnet School Relocation Approved.\\" Los Angeles Times. June 9, 1999. Retrieved on January 15, 2012. The vote occurred on the day of LAUSD board elections. On that day, Barbara Boudreaux, a board member who advocated for the move of Community to Walgrove, was replaced by a new board member who opposed of the move. As the plans commenced, parent groups at Community and Walgrove made contact, and the district hired Martinez Amador Architects Inc. as the architect. Martinez Amador began designing the campus. In December 1999, Community Magnet was scheduled to open in its new location in the northern hemisphere fall of 2001. As time passed, several high-up LAUSD officials related to the proposed move were replaced, and the school district's facilities division, which manages construction of LAUSD schools, had been reorganized. Ruben Zacarias, who served as the LAUSD superintendent, was replaced by Ramon C. Cortines, who was in turn replaced by Roy Romer. By January 2000, the district had not officially given Martinez Amador a contract to build the new facility. Mithers said that by March 2000, \\"it was growing clear that $4.6 million for the new school wasn't enough.\\" In May of that year, Kathi Littman, the new facilities director, stated that the school should have \\"stick built,\\" or buildings constructed on site, instead of pre- fabricated buildings, raising the budget to $6 million. In July 2001, LAUSD informed the Community School that it would not move to the Walgrove site. Around July 2002 the school was considering moving to the former Bellagio Road School campus.\\"Community School Proposed Relocation to Bellagio Road School Community Meeting.\\" Community Magnet School.

Stephanie Guzman of the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism of the University of Southern California said that Community, \\"[s]urrounded by million dollar homes and views,\\" \\"is what you‚Äôd expect for Bel Air.\\" The school was previously in the Airdrome Campus, located on the property of the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies campus in Mid-City. While there, the school was in a property with \\"temporary\\" classroom buildings. While at its Mid-City location, the school did not have covered halls, its own art room, auditorium, food preparation area, or cafeteria/lunchroom. Therefore, when the weather was rainy, students ate lunch within their classrooms, and they traveled through the rain to reach the restrooms. After mandatory class-size reductions occurred, more classes needed to be made, so the school converted two bathrooms and the library into classrooms. In 2002, eight toilets was present for the school's about 300 students. One faculty restroom was present for 36 teachers, office employees, and teacher aides. The classrooms had no air conditioning and no internet access. In 2002 the paint within the classroom building was peeling off. Because of the conditions, Pamela Marton, the school's principal, had asked LAUSD to upgrade Community Magnet School's campus for several years. In 1999 Marton said that \\"[o]ur school is old and dilapidated. The future looked very bleak here.\\" During that year, Martha Groves of the Los Angeles Times said \\"Against the odds, teachers and the school's devoted parents have made the place a nurturing home, painting colorful murals and creating a palpable sense of, well, community.\\" Admissions The school uses a point system and a lottery to determine which students to admit. The school routinely receives large numbers of applications. The first step is assigning prospective students points based on criteria. For instance, if a student attends a school consisting of racial and ethnic minorities, the student gets four points. If a student has a neighborhood school which has more students than the designed capacity, the student receives four points. For each occasion that the same student applies to Community Magnet, the student gets four points. The applications of the students who have the highest numbers of points are then placed in a lottery. The winners of that lottery are permitted to attend Community Magnet. The school has racial quotas, so that 40% of the students are non-Hispanic White and 60% are of racial and ethnic minorities. On Tuesday December 11, 2007 California Superior Court Judge Judge Paul Gutman ruled that under California law, LAUSD's racial quota system, which it had been ordered to use by the court system in 1981, would remain in effect. The case was not affected by the July 2007 U.S. Supreme Court Meredith v. Jefferson County Board of Education/Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 rulings. In 2004, for every one of the school's 40 Kindergarten slots, it had received 31 applications. In 2010 the school received 2,400 applications for all of its open slots, including 72 Kindergarten slots and a few slots for other grades. Despite being located in Bel-Air, the school does not give admission priority for area students. The school's magnet coordinator says that \\"If you live in Bel Air and come from a wealthy community, you don‚Äôt get any points.\\" As of 2005, to raise awareness about the school to prospective parents, the school sends fliers in English and Spanish to at least 100 preschools within Los Angeles. The school also holds orientation days and field calls in the school auditorium, using the languages of English, Spanish, and Korean. Student body As of 2010, 470 students from various communities within LAUSD attend the school. Because of the racial quotas, 40% of the students are White and 60% are racial and ethnic minorities. Because of the ways the application process gives favor to residents of other communities, children from Bel-Air generally do not attend the school. As of December 1999, the school's 368 students lived across LAUSD. 70% of the school's students lived east of the school's location, then in Mid-City. Many of the students lived in Koreatown. Of the racial groups, over 50% of the students were of black and Asian descent. In 2002 the school had around 300 students. Curriculum The school's academic program focuses on the humanities, and the curriculum focuses heavily on visual arts. Carla Cretaro, the magnet coordinator, said in 2010 that \\"We don‚Äôt teach to the test. Our philosophy is, if we teach our best all the time and give them the activities and information they need, they‚Äôll be fine on the exam.\\" As of 2003 and 2004 Community's kindergarten program is all day.Merl, Jean. \\"L.A.

As a book, its influence has been debated as significant and as a phrase it has entered common parlance in mainstream media and was referenced in books such as The Pope's Children. He responded directly to the various controversies that grew up around Bungalow Bliss in his book called Bungalow Bashing. In an essay titled \\"The House that Jack Built\\" in Ireland Unbound (a collection of 20 essays edited by Michel Peillon and Mary P. Corcoran, on the rapid transformation of Ireland as it entered the 21st century), Stephen Quilley addresses a disagreement between Jack Fitzsimons and journalist Frank McDonald who coined the phrase \\"Bungalow Blitz\\" as part of a series of articles attacking the \\"spreading fungus\\" of the proliferation of ribbon development bungalows in Ireland. In his contribution Quilley highlights the country's planning laws rather than the architectural qualities of the bungalows as being the main problem. The essay refers to one of the core drivers of Bungalow Bliss which was that \\"bright modern bungalows were synonymous with an escape from rural poverty and domestic drudgery\\" (p. 94). In 2020, Hugh Wallace (architect and presenter) announced a property makeover series inspired by Bungalow bliss featuring four 1970s, 80s and 90s bungalows. https://www.independent.ie/life/home-garden/big-bungalow-blitz-tv- architect-hugh-wallace-plans-to-launch-irelands-1970s-home- revival-39278974.html He also published a further range of books on aspects of Meath, heritage, and politics as well as some fiction. These publications included a detailed and personal study of the thatched cottages of Meath illuminated by his own photographs of these dwellings and a history of his native parish of Kilbeg in County Meath, where he attended school in the village of Carlanstown. In his last year, he completed a collection of short stories titled \\"The Pilates of Geblik\\". This collection was posthumously published by Kells Publishing Company in 2016 and publicly launched by Thomas Byrne (TD).

It is located on a 0.85-acre rectangular-shaped property, owned by Jackson County, approximately 60 meters east of Caney Fork Creek, a major branch of the northwestward-trending Tuckasegee River, in the mountains of western North Carolina. The petroglyph boulder occurs within an artificially created bowl-shaped depression. Today this is covered with mowed grass (it was previously cultivated as a corn field) and bordered on the west by a thicket of river cane (Arundinaria gigantea). Slightly upslope and east of the boulder are a few smaller outcroppings of soapstone bedrock, at least two of which show definite scars left by quarrying for soapstone bowl manufacture. Description The surface of the westward-slanting main boulder with petroglyphs, which measures roughly ; it includes scars left by soapstone bowl extraction. Three depressions show stem extraction and three more are hollow scallops.Johannes Loubser and Douglas Frink. Heritage Resource Conservation Plan for Judaculla Rock, State Archaeological Site 31JK3, North Carolina. Stratum Report submitted to Jackson County, Sylva 2008 Numerous petroglyph designs have been pecked and incised into the surface. The densely packed motifs, especially those along the upper two-thirds of the boulder, often makes it difficult to distinguish between the carvings. A minimum count of the patterns revealed 1,458 cup marks, 47 curvilinear units, ten bowl- shaped depressions, ten stick-like figures, nine rills, three concentric rings designs, three curvilinear motifs, three deer tracks, two claw-like imprints, one arc, one cross-in-circle, and one winged shape. Date range Petroglyphs that occur within three hollow scallops suggest that their production took place after soapstone bowl quarrying had ceased at the site, a finding supported by similar overlaps at a smaller soapstone boulder in western North Carolina (Brinkley Rock) and two more in northern Georgia (Track Rock Gap and Sprayberry Rock). In terms of stylistic cross-dating, the similarity between the concentric ring and cross-in-ring petroglyph designs on the boulder with patterns on ceramic from the region suggests that the petroglyphs over the Late Archaic soapstone extraction scars date somewhere between the Middle Woodland and Late Mississippian periods.Scott Ashcraft and David Moore. \\"Native American Rock Art in Western North Carolina.\\" In Collected Papers on the Archaeology of Western North Carolina, edited by D.

Significance From a rock art perspective, the boulder is significant as it contains more petroglyphs than any other known boulder east of the Mississippi River. Judaculla Rock contains approximately 1,548 motifs, 3.7 times the total of 421 motifs at the substantial Track Rock Gap petroglyph boulder complex in far northern Georgia. From an archaeological perspective, the intact deposits upslope from Judaculla Rock contain physical traces of Late Archaic soapstone quarrying and bowl manufacturing activities. The location of Judaculla Rock between Cullowhee townhouse and Judaculla's townhouse in Tannasee Bald is reflected in Cherokee stories of other petroglyph boulders in the mountains and foothills of North Carolina and northern Georgia.John Haywood. The Natural and Aboriginal History of Tennessee, Up to the First Settlements therein by the White People, in the Year 1768. George Wilson, Nashville. 1823 These intermediary locations tie the summer agricultural pursuits in the floodplains to the fall and winter hunting in the uplands. It is also significant that the petroglyph boulders are probably stylized picture maps of the terrain where they are found.Johannes Loubser. \\"Heritage Resources Evaluation of the Allen Petroglyph Boulder, 9HM299, Habersham County, Chattooga River Ranger District, Georgia.\\" Stratum Unlimited Report submitted to USDA Forest Service, Gainesville. 2011 Judaculla Rock appears to be physical representation of the entire landscape the Cherokees inhabited, and it not only embodies a distinctive characteristic of petroglyph boulders in the region but also is likely to yield additional information about the history and prehistory of the area. Collaboration in Jackson County between the Parker family, the North Carolina Rock Art Project, the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians, the Western Carolina University, the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, and the Caney Fork Community Council, enabled the construction of a semi-circular elevated viewing platform at the site, complete with interpretive signs. This pro-active conservation and management of Judaculla Rock has turned it into a textbook example of how rock art sites in other parts of the country can be preserved, interpreted, and presented on a sustainable basis to the visiting public for generations to come. In 2013, Judaculla Rock was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

History Tavistock used to have two railway stations, both now closed, with trains to Plymouth: * Tavistock North was the Plymouth, Devonport and South Western Junction Railway station, operated by the London and South Western Railway. * Tavistock South was the Great Western Railway station, on the other side of the river Tavy, opposite the town. Current situation The trackbed of the Tavistock North route for around a mile south of Tavistock North station is open to the public as a footpath and nature reserve. The route is almost intact to Bere Alston where it joins today's Tamar Valley Line between Gunnislake and Plymouth. An engineering assessment in 2009 showed that the rail-bed, bridges and tunnels between Bere Alston and Tavistock were in sound condition. The Tamar Valley line, with which the line from Tavistock would connect, was designated as a community rail line in September 2005, being one of seven pilots for the Department for Transport's Community Rail Development Strategy. One of the aims of this designation was to establish the potential for extending the line from Bere Alston to Tavistock. Department for Transport Rail Group (2005), Route prospectus for the ... Looe Valley Line and ... Tamar Valley Line Reopening plans In 2008 Kilbride, a housing developer, offered to pay for rebuilding the railway to Bere Alston (from a new station just to the south of Tavistock, on the route from the former Tavistock North station) if agreement to build 800 properties near the station could be concluded. Kilbride published a detailed update on this project in December 2010. A report by Devon County Council in September 2010 said: \\"In suffering deteriorating travel conditions while having to support new development, Tavistock is not unique. Where it differs from other towns is that there is a timely, sustainable and affordable solution that will benefit Tavistock‚Äôs residents and visitors among others. This solution is the proposed reinstatement of the rail service between Tavistock and Plymouth via Bere Alston.\\" The West Devon Core Strategy, which was adopted on 19 April 2011, identified the need for additional residential and employment development in Tavistock and the potential need to reopen the railway to Bere Alston. Devon County Council has said that it is working with West Devon Borough Council, the developer and Kilbride Community Rail to develop the project further but reinstatement would occur only in the long term. The County Council would be undertaking the necessary work to secure the powers to build the railway over the coming few years. West Devon Borough Council announced in August 2011 that Kilbride Group had sold its interest in the residential land at the site to national house builder Bovis Homes Ltd, and that Kilbride would work with Devon County Council to be the promoter of the rail reinstatement scheme, which will largely be funded by the residential development. Councillor Stuart Hughes, Devon County Council Cabinet Member for Highways and Transportation, said: ‚ÄúImproving links to major urban areas is a key transport vision for Devon‚Äôs market towns, and making better use of sustainable transport, including rail, is an important element of this vision. This proposed rail link will play a vital role in improving connections between Tavistock and Plymouth to offer a real alternative to using the car, while also providing Tavistock with a link to the national rail network‚Äù. Network Rail's Network Specification for the Western route, published in September 2011, noted that \\"West Devon Council are proposing to reinstate the former railway line between Bere Alston and Tavistock subject to funding and availability of rolling stock\\". A Devon County Council leaflet, endorsed by West Devon Borough Council, Bovis Homes and Kilbride Community Rail, was published in February 2012 outlining the project and emphasising that a public inquiry would be necessary before work could begin, with the inquiry not likely to be held until 2014. The county council launched a consultation in January 2013 on reopening the railway between Tavistock and Bere Alston, and providing a parallel cycle track. It submitted a report to the Planning inspectorate in October 2014 to the inspectorate to trigger a decision on whether a full environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the proposals is required (the ‚Äòscreening‚Äô stage), and the second step is to set out the scope of the assessments needed for the EIA (the ‚Äòscoping‚Äô stage). In February 2017 it was suggested that new cheap 'no-frill mini trains' could be running on disused or little used lines across the country such as Bere Aston to Tavistock in order to see services closed by Beeching reopened.No-frills mini trains offer route to reopening lines that Beeching shut, The Times 11 February 2017 Plymouth City Council announced in April 2017 that a line to Tavistock could be open within five years and be connected to a tram-style 'Plymouth metro' by 2024.New 'Plymouth Metro' could include new station in Plympton, Plymouth Heald, 23 February 2017Map of ambitious 'Plymouth Metro' network with new train stations revealed, Plymouth Herald, 12 April 2017 See also * Exeter to Plymouth railway of the LSWR * Plymouth, Devonport and South Western Junction Railway References Category:Proposed railway stations in England Category:Tavistock ","title":"Tavistock railway station"},{"id":"34389746","title":"Anastassia Morkovkina"},{"id":"34389759","text":"St. Paul's Episcopal Church is a historic Episcopalian church in Fremont, a city in the northwestern part of the U.S. state of Ohio. Built in the 1840s and expanded multiple times in the following decades, it has been named a historic site for its distinctive architecture. Organic history Fremont's first Protestant Episcopalian meeting was held on January 15, 1842, with twenty-eight individuals present. Parish officers were chosen ten days later, and the first meeting of the vestry in early February petitioned Bishop McIlvaine for a pastor. Before long, a priest began coming periodically from Norwalk, and a new priest was ordained in the following November, although he only served one year before resigning due to ill health.Everett, Homer. History of Sandusky County Ohio: With Portraits and Biographies of Prominent Citizens and Pioneers. Cleveland: Williams, 1882. In 1843, the members built a new church building on the northwestern corner of Main and Court Streets. Before this time, they had occupied multiple other locations; their first meetings were held in the Methodist church building, an old stone school-house that was later replaced with the city high school, and the courthouse. Funds were raised through pew rents and additional donations from the wealthier members. Bishop McIlvaine officially dedicated the building in late 1845. The interior was renovated and frescoed in 1859, and gas was introduced in 1861. Special attention was given to attract children to the Sunday school, and it grew immensely. Further renovations were performed in 1872 and 1873; more than $8000 was spent to enlarge the building, replace the furnace and carpet, and reconstruct other elements of the interior. At this time, plans were made to add a tower, and they were put into place in 1906. Until this time, it had been a small rectangular building with a simple gabled roof.Owen, Lorrie K., ed.

She belonged to the Parisian Bourgeoisie and was the wife of judge Leferon. In 1669, she poisoned her husband with a poison sold to her by La Voisin and married her lover, De Prade. When De Prade proved to be a fortune hunter she decided to murder him as well, which was prevented by his escape. Leferon was arrested during the Poison Affair in 1679. La Voisin, on her way to execution, named her as her client. She was proven guilty, but was still only sentenced to exile from the capital and a fine of 1500 livres. The case against Marguerite Leferon and Fran√ßoise de Dreux, as well as that of Marguerite de Poulaillon, attracted attention as they were the first clients and the first members of the upper classes to be implicated in the affair. The light sentences imposed on them, despite their guilt, was considered damaging to the legitimacy of the court. This was obvious proof of class discrimination, as others accused for the same crime in the case, but of a different social class, were sentenced to execution. One example was that of Madame Philbert, who in 1673 murdered her carpenter husband Brunet by poison of Marie Bosse in order to marry her lover, Philippe Rebille Philbert: her crime was identical to that of Leferon, but she was sentenced to hang after having her right hand cut off.

Just. X.73.2. Description The term zygostates often appears in inscriptions and papyri of the late Roman Empire in the form of zygostates tes poleos (Greek: , \\"public weigher of the city\\"). The Byzantine emperor Justinian I (r. 527‚Äì565) regarded the zygostatai, in his 11th Edict, as the main offenders in changing the purity of gold coins. Some imperial seals bearing the name of zygostatai are preserved from the 6th and 7th centuries AD. In the Taktika of the 9th and 10th centuries AD, the zygostates is a state, rather than urban, functionary belonging to the staff of the sakellion.. The epithet \\"imperial\\" is granted to the zygostates on a Byzantine seal dating to the 7th century AD. Based on this evidence, John Bagnell Bury surmised that in the 7th century the zygostates began to examine and weigh coins that came to the Byzantine imperial treasury. The Byzantine Greek monk and abbot, Theodore the Studite, described the zygostasia, or the imperial station where the zygostatai worked, as a profitable business. As for Christopher of Mytilene, he praised a zygostates named Eustathios as the founder of a church and \\"one of the great chartoularioi\\". The term zygastikon (Greek: Œ∂œÖŒ≥Œ±œÉœÑŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ), attested in a false privilege granted to the city of Monemvasia in 1316, refers to one of the customary payments made to toll inspectors for measuring and weighing wares. On a functional level, the zygastikon had nothing in common with the zygostates of the sakellion.

He proved to be an excellent linguist and took up a professorship at Fort William College in Calcutta, India. In 1807 he resigned his professorship for the position of Resident at the Indian city of Lucknow which he held until 1815. In that year was commissioned a Lieutenant-Colonel of the 4th Native Infantry. He returned to the United Kingdom in 1816 and as well as managing the family estates in Inverness-shire he became Member of Parliament and a director of the East India Company. Biography John Baillie was born at Inverness on 10 May 1772. He was the younger son of George Baillie of Leys, Inverness, and his wife, Anne. Baillie served in the East India Company from 1790 until retiring in 1818 (arriving in India in 1791 and leaving in 1816). He was commissioned an ensign in 1793 and a lieutenant in 1794, devoting his leisure to the study of oriental languages, which he prosecuted with such success that on the foundation of the new college of Fort William College in Calcutta in 1801 he was appointed professor of the Arabic and Persian languages and of Mohammedan law. In 1803, on the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Maratha War, Baillie joined in the siege of Agra with the rank of captain, and soon after was appointed to the difficult post of Political Agent at Bundelkhand in central India. Disaffection was rife there, and the chiefs were forming dangerous combinations. Captain Baillie, however, succeeded in disuniting the league of the chiefs and re-establishing order and security, for which services he was publicly thanked by the governor-general in a letter to the directors, in which it was said that \\"the British authority in Bundelkhand was only preserved by his fortitude, ability, and influence\\". He had, in fact, transferred to the company a territory with a revenue of ¬£225,000 a year. Baillie resigned his professorship in 1807 for the position of Resident at the Indian city of Lucknow which he held till 1815. In that year was commissioned a Lieutenant-Colonel of the 4th Native Infantry. Baillie returned to the United Kingdom in 1816 and as well as managing the family estates in Inverness-shire he became Member of Parliament and a director of the East India Company. He stood successfully for Parliament: for Hedon (1820‚Äì1830), Inverness Burghs (1830‚Äì1831) and again for Inverness Burghs (1832 ‚Äì 20 April 1833). He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1817.Complete List of Royal Society Fellows 1660-2007 In 1823 he became a director of the East India Company, and was willing use his influence in Parliament to support the Companies interests. Works While professor, John Baillie wrote: *Sixty Tables elucidatory of a Course of Lectures on Arabic Grammar delivered in the College of Fort William during the first year of its institution (first edition 1801) *'The Five Books upon Arabic Grammar, i.e. the \\"Meeut √Çmel\\", \\"Shurhu Meeut √Çmel\\", \\"Mesb√¢h\\", \\"Hed√¢yut oon-Nuhve\\", and the \\"K√¢feea\\", of which the first four were issued in two thin volumes in 1802‚Äì3, and the last had not been published by 1900. Baillie also translated from the Arabic part (relating to commercial transactions) of a digest of Mohammedan law in 1797, at the request of Sir John Shore (Lord Teignmouth), the then governor-general, but the work was never completed. Baillie's position as Resident in Lucknow allowed him to amass a large collection of manuscripts, many of which later passed to the Edinburgh University Library in 1876, where they were catalogued by Edward Robertson in 1912. He is best known for his collection of paintings and illustrated manuscripts, such as the Jami al-Tawarikh, and the poems of Hafiz of Sharaz.

She had just turned 2 when she was taken from her Chicago, Illinois home on May 15, 1930. Her abduction was heavily covered by both local and national media, but her whereabouts have never been ascertained. Her kidnapping is the oldest unsolved case of this nature in the files of the Chicago Missing Persons Bureau. Disappearance Catherine Moroney had married Michael Moroney at the age of 13 and, four years later, had two daughters: Mary Agnes, 2, and Anastasia, 11 months. The family, who lived at 5200 Wentworth Avenue, were very poor, as Michael only made US$15 per week passing out handbills. A relative of Catherine's wrote to the needy- family service and a paragraph on their plight was printed. The service did not normally disclose addresses, but, through a slip, the Moroneys' address was learned by a woman. On May 14, 1930, while Catherine was scrubbing the floor, there was a knock at the door. When Catherine opened the door, she was greeted by a woman who stated she had been sent by a social worker to deal with the Moroneys' case. She was described as well-dressed, about 22 years of age, with protruding teeth and a \\"cultured\\" voice. The woman identified herself as \\"Julia Otis\\". After listening to the Moroneys' many problems, she asked Catherine if she could temporarily take Mary Agnes to California with her, adding that she would be unrecognisable and \\"fat as a butterball\\". Catherine refused. After promising to return, the stranger handed Catherine $2 and left. The next day, May 15, the woman came back, this time with baby clothes, as Catherine was pregnant. The woman stated that she had arranged to get a better job for her husband Michael and then offered to take Mary to a nearby store and buy her some clothes and shoes. Reluctantly, Catherine gave her consent. Later, Catherine commented that Mary Agnes sobbed and refused to go with the woman, but she was taken anyway. Mary Agnes and the unidentified woman never returned. Letters First letter The Moroney family received a letter from \\"Otis\\" the day after she took Mary Agnes. It read: This was the last the Moroneys ever heard from \\"Julia Otis\\". Second letter Two weeks after the kidnapping, a woman who identified herself as \\"Alice Henderson\\" sent the Moroneys a letter in which she stated that \\"Otis\\" was her cousin and that she was \\"love hungry\\" because her own husband and baby had died the year before. Henderson never wrote again and authorities state that the letter from \\"Otis\\" was written in the same handwriting as the one written by \\"Henderson\\". Alleged findings Martha Thompson In July 1931, an elder Native American woman named Martha Thompson was found pushing a cart to join a circus. The cart contained a blond-haired, blue-eyed three-year-old girl that matched Mary Agnes' description. Thompson maintained that the girl was abandoned by her mother, Florence Fuller, and begged to be allowed to keep her. The Moroneys did not identify the girl as Mary Agnes. Mary McClelland In 1952, a 24-year-old housewife called Mary McClelland (n√©e Beck) came forward, claiming that, by looking at photos of Mary Agnes's siblings (six more were born after her kidnapping), she suspected she was Mary Agnes. She had been adopted within a year of Mary Agnes's disappearance by Charles and Nora Beck. Dr. Kraus, after studying and comparing her dental casts, named her as one of the family. Her skull and blood showed she was a Moroney and her mother claimed to recognize her. An aging physician named Dr. E. W. Merrithew, however, stated that he delivered McClelland to an unknown mother on November 17, 1927 and that her mother provided a baby picture of her daughter dating from 1928, which proved she had been adopted two years before the Moroney abduction. Further more, Mary Agnes underwent an operation for a ruptured navel, but McClelland did not have the scar Mary Agnes had at the time of her disappearance. Further DNA testing proved she was not Mary Agnes. She died in 2005. The Moroney kidnapping remains unsolved.

He is currently the head football coach at the United States Military Academy, a position he has held since the 2014 season. Monken previously served as the head football coach of Georgia Southern University from 2010 to 2013. Prior to that, he worked under Paul Johnson as a running backs coach and special teams coordinator at Georgia Southern, the United States Naval Academy, and Georgia Tech. Coaching career Assistant coaching career After graduating from Millikin University in Decatur, Illinois in 1989, Monken took his first coaching position as a graduate assistant at Hawaii. It was during his tenure at Hawaii he first worked under Paul Johnson, who was the Rainbows' offensive coordinator at the time. From Hawaii, Monken coached for one season at Arizona State and three seasons at Buffalo. He was hired as a head coach for the first time at J. Sterling Morton High School for the 1995 season. From Morton, Monken spent one season at Concordia before being hired by Johnson as a running backs coach at Georgia Southern in 1997. He continued to coach under Johnson at Georgia Southern (1997‚Äì2001), at Navy (2002‚Äì2007), and at Georgia Tech (2008‚Äì2009) before taking the head coaching position at Georgia Southern. Head coaching career In November 2009, Monken was hired to succeed Chris Hatcher as the head coach at Georgia Southern. In his first season with the Georgia Southern, Monken led the Eagles to an overall record of 10‚Äì5 and to the 2010 FCS Playoffs Semifinals, defeating top-ranked and previously undefeated Appalachian State to begin a streak of six consecutive wins. In 2011, Monken led the Eagles to an overall record of 11‚Äì3, the Southern Conference championship and a second-straight trip to the 2011 FCS Playoffs Semifinals. He was named both the AFCA 2011 FCS Region 2 Coach of the Year and the Southern Conference Coach of the Year. In 2012, Monken again led the Eagles to a Southern Conference Championship with a 10‚Äì4 overall record, a third consecutive FCS Semifinal Game appearance and final No. 3 national ranking. Georgia Southern accepted an invitation to join the Sun Belt Conference in March 2013 and subsequently made the move to FBS. In its first transition year in 2013, the Eagles were not eligible for the NCAA playoffs and ended their FCS history with a 26‚Äì20 victory over Florida in the season finale. Army On December 30, 2013, Monken was introduced as the 37th head coach of the Army Black Knights football program. In 2018, he became the first head coach to lead Army to three consecutive bowl appearances, consecutive 10-win seasons, and its first ever 11-win season. These resulted in a final AP Poll ranking of No. 19 and final Coaches Poll ranking of No. 20 for Monken's 2018 Black Knights, the highest the Black Knights had finished in the final polls since legendary Army coach Earl 'Red' Blaik's 1958 squad. It also resulted in the Cadets winning their eighth Lambert Trophy (signifying the Black Knights as the best team in the East in Division I FBS), but their first since that 1958 team. Following his team's 2018 accomplishments, Coach Monken was awarded the George Munger Collegiate Coach of the Year Award by the Maxwell Football Club, the Vince Lombardi College Football Coach of the Year Award by the Lombardi Foundation, and the President's Award by the Touchdown Club of Columbus. Personal life Monken is a cousin of Todd Monken, the current offensive coordinator at the University of Georgia.

He went on to make 18 league appearances and score 1 goal. At the end of the season, he re-signed for Newcastle, having merged to form 'United'. He made his league debut on 1 September against Darwen, but scored his first goals for the club a week later against Burton Swifts. Smith made a total of 25 league appearances, scoring 10 times. On 14 November 1895, he signed for Loughborough and went on to make 14 appearances, scoring 1 goal for the club. After retiring, Smith moved back to Newcastle and became a bar manager and the 1901 Census says he has had a further 4 children. The family then moved to Byker, where Smith worked as a fitter. On the 23 January 1911, Smith committed suicide at the age of 45. An inquest gave the verdict as due to \\"a depressed state of mind‚Äù, likely due to the death of one of his children the week before.

It was formerly classified as Elymus junceus. It is native to Russia and China, and has been introduced to other parts of the world, such as Canada and the United States.Taylor, Jane E. (2005). Psathyrostachys juncea. In: Fire Effects Information System, [Online]. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory. Retrieved January 18, 2012. Psathyrostachys juncea is a great source of food for grazing animals, as it has high nutrition value in its dense basal leaves, even in the late summer and autumn seasons. This species can grow and prosper in many harsh environments, making it an ideal candidate for improvement as it can grow in areas were farming is difficult. This species is a drought-resistant forage plant and can survive during the cool seasons. It is also a cross- pollinator and is self-sterile. This means that P. juncea cannot self- fertilize; it must find another plant of the same species with which to exchange gametes. Self-sterilization increases the genetic diversity of a species. Description Psathyrostachys juncea is a perennial bunch grass that grows in tufts that may be up to tall or taller. The grass is long-lived and known to persist in cultivation for 25 years or more. The grass has a dense root network beneath each clump; there are no rhizomes or stolons. The roots can reach deep into the soil. The leaves are located around the stem bases, and are straight or curled. Old leaf sheaths become shreddy. The inflorescence is a spike up to long.Psathyrostachys juncea. Grass Manual Treatment. Retrieved January 18, 2012. Cultivars Many cultivars of Psathyrostachys juncea have been developed, including 'Vinall', 'Bozoisky- Select', and 'Bozoisky II'.  Seedling vigor  Though Psathyrostachys juncea can survive in harsh conditions, it is a hard species to initially plant, because the seeds must be in the correct conditions in order to begin germination. Psathyrostachys juncea has low seedling vigor, which affects the success of germination. But once P. juncea has begun germination, it can tolerate most harsh weather conditions. In recent years, scientists have explored possible solutions to improving seedling vigor. One possible technique to increasing seedling vigor is increasing ploidy. In nature, P. juncea are diploids, however, tetraploid germplasm have been show to increase seed size and seedling vigor in P. juncea. Regeneration of this species has been successful, meaning that scientists can more easily select for specific traits and manipulate P. juncea at the cellular level. Thus, humans can easily induce tetraploidy in P. juncea. As a result, breeding programs have begun to grow tetraploid cultivars so as to increase the success of P. juncea germination. There is a small change in tissue quality and nutrition content with different ploidy levels, but nothing significant. Therefore, increasing tetraploid cultivars is a possible avenue for improving seed quality. Path analysis has been conducted to examine what exactly effects seed yield. Fertile, strong stems (tillers), the number of flowers (florets) per flower cluster (spikelet), and seed weight all showed positive relationships with seed yield. That is, P. juncea with more stems/tillers, more flowers, and/or heavier seeds have improved seed yield. However, the number of flower clusters (spikelet) per stem and number of seeds per flower cluster were negatively correlated with seed yield. Thus, having more flowers on a cluster, not more seeds per cluster, increasing seed yield. This information can be used to improve breeding programs for P. juncea. In addition, water stress also improves leaf and inflorescence tissue quality, while nitrogen rich fertilizer improves leaf, stem, and inflorescence tissue quality. Increased tissue quality is related to improvements in total yield. Uses Psathyrostachys juncea was introduced to North America as a forage grass and for rangeland rehabilitation and soil stabilization. The grass is \\"one of the most versatile forage grasses available for dryland pastures.\\"Psathryrostachys juncea. USDA NRCS Plant Guide. Retrieved January 18, 2012. It is palatable to livestock, though it does not make a good hay due to its basal leaves. It is also palatable for wild ungulates, such as elk. The grass is a particularly good forage when planted in alternating rows with a legume, such as alfalfa. It is not generally invasive and usually does not become a noxious weed. It rarely grows outside of plots where it has been planted. The Southwestern United States has some invasive occurrences, such as on the Grand Canyon plateaus. It is drought-resistant, flood-resistant most of the year, and is tolerant of cold. It is also tolerant of high soil salinity. It is not easy to establish via seed; if the seeds are planted more than 1.9 centimeters deep the seedlings do not emerge in large numbers. The seedlings are weak. Once it has established, however, it is tough and competes well for water and nutrients. It is tolerant of fire because the dense clumpiness of the stems protects the axillary buds, which can produce tillers and resprout after destruction by fire.  Evolutionary relationships  There are four novel alleles coding for high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) in the genus Psathyrostachys. High molecular weight glutenin subunits provide protein to the endosperm in wheat relatives but also determine the level of wheat improvement possible in a plant species. These proteins are coded from the Gun-1 locus, and studying this locus has helped scientists trace the evolutionary ties between Triticeae species. This means that P. juncea has close evolutionary ties to wild wheat relatives. Wheat improvement is therefore a major possibility for P. juncea. By improving wheat quality, P. juncea could potentially become a crop for human consumption, especially in areas were growing crops is challenging such as in dry or drought areas. The current obstacle to wheat improvement is that cross-pollinating wheat and P. juncea is extremely difficult because their gametes are not compatible with each other.

In October 2017, with the launch of the Global Wrestling Network, the event became available to stream on demand. Storylines The event featured wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Event Prior to the start of the broadcast there was a dark match which saw Shannon Moore defeat Cassidy Riley. This was followed by one preshow match which entailed The Diamonds in the Rough (David Young and Elix Skipper) defeating Shark Boy and Norman Smiley. The opening match of the pay-per-view saw Jay Lethal take on Alex Shelley. Toward the end of the match, Lethal hit the diving head butt off the top for a near fall, nut Shelley kicked out. Lethal then went for a suplex, however Shelley blocked it hitting Sliced Bread #2 for the victory. The second match saw Lance Hoyt defeat Matt Bentley. Next the next match was between The Naturals (Chase Stevens and Andy Douglas) and Team Canada (Bobby Roode and Eric Young). Ultimately Team Canada picked up the victory after using a hockey stick as a weapon. A six-man tag team match was next which saw The James Gang (B.G. James and Kip James) and Bob Armstrong take on The Latin American Xchange (Homicide, Hernandez and Machete). Although Homicide spent most of the match in the ring, the match ended when Machete was left alone in the ring. Kip hits Machete with a cobra slutch slam to pick up the victory. The next match was a four way match between Petey Williams, Chris Sabin, Sonjay Dutt and Puma. The match ended with a series of finishing moves hit on each other. First Williams has the sharpshooter on Puma before Dutt breaks it up. Then Dutt hits a piledriver on Williams, followed by trying to hit Williams with the Canadian Destroyer, however Williams reverses it and hits it on him. Sabin then tried a Cradle Shock, Petey tried a Destroyer and ultimately Puma hit a blockbuster on Sabin. Sabin kicks out and hits the Craddle Shock on Puma to pick up the win. The next match was a 4 on 4 match called an 8-Man War match. This match saw Team 3D (Brother Ray and Brother Devon), Rhino and Ron Killings take on America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm), Jeff Jarrett and Abyss. Toward the end of the match, Killings attempted to get his team an advantage by taking Harris' handcuffs and locking him up outside the ring. Harris however was able to grab Killings' foot which gave Jarrett the opening he needed to hit The Stroke and pick up the victory. The second to last match was an Ultimate X match for the TNA X Division Championship. This match saw Samoa Joe defend his title against Christopher Daniels and A.J. Styles. After Styles went for the X, Joe attacked him with a chair. Daniels then kicked the chair back into Joe's face enabling him to climb up and grab the X and win the championship. The main event was for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. This match saw Christian Cage fend his title against Monty Brown. At the end of the match, Brown attempted to hit the Alpha Bomb however Cage reversed it and hit the Unprettier to retain the championship.

The Clifton was part of the second phase of hotel construction and expansion in the city of Davenport, which lasted from about the time of the American Civil War until the early 20th-century. It was in business for several decades and lasted longer than most of its contemporaries. There is some evidence that the building may have housed a brothel after its service as a hotel. It was located on the edge of the city's notorious Bucktown District. Eventually, it became part of the Petersen Harned and Von Maur Department Store complex, where it was used for storage. The property passed to the President Riverboat Casino, who had plans for the building that never materialized. Demolition The President Riverboat Casino planned to demolish the building in 1995 and threatened to sue if the preservationists voted to save the building.

Of the secondary schools, 80% were private. At the time, 47% of all primary school-aged children in Beijing attended school.

Dong Jianhong and Chen Tiying wrote that \\"education in Beijing lagged far behind\\" that of the rest of the country prior to the founding of the People's Republic. Dong Jianhong and Chen Tiying wrote that education in Beijing \\"developed rapidly\\" after the 1949 founding. The municipal government established additional higher education facilities, acquired and reorganized schools, established new schools in lower class and working class areas, lowered age limits in the school admission policies, and decreased cutoff scores on achievement tests for working class children during the years 1949 through 1957. Departments of education were established for the Beijing municipality and each of the Beijing districts in 1954. Dong Jianhong and Chen Tiying wrote that in the Great Leap Forward period school activities were not focused on education and instead were \\"mostly devoted to political movements and productive labor\\" which produced a low educational quality. During the period many schools established school-operated factories that their students worked in, and the Beijing educational authorities established part-work part- study experimental schools and work-study programs. The authorities opened many senior secondary schools and closed many part-study, part-time, and vocational schools during the Cultural Revolution. In 1986 the starting age for primary education for urban children was changed from 7 to 6.Dong and Chen, p. 123.

These two universities top the rankings in the Times Higher Education Asia University Rankings, the QS BRICS University Rankings, and the Times Higher Education BRICS & Emerging Economies Rankings. Owing to Beijing's status as the political and cultural capital of China, a larger proportion of tertiary-level institutions are concentrated here than in any other city in China, reaching at least 70 in number. Many international students from Japan, Korea, North America, Europe, Southeast Asia, and elsewhere come to Beijing to study every year. As of 2011, according to the Beijing Educational Committee, 700,000 students attend universities based in Beijing. Of those students, according to the committee, 15-20% come from families classified as being in poverty. As of 2011 the municipal government had pledged 50 million yuan ($7.3 million U.S.) as an addition to its funds for assisting university students in poverty. The first university dedicated for ethnic minority students in Beijing is the Minzu University of China, or the Central University of Nationalities (CUN), established in 1951. \\"Moral education\\" at the university level is integrated into other subjects.

Primary and secondary education The High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University The Beijing municipal government has made efforts to provide a nine-year compulsory education. Several experts, including the Beijing Normal University education specialist Binxian Zhang, have argued that Beijing should make twelve years of education compulsory. As of June 2010 the Beijing government allowed 75 local public and private schools to teach foreign students. The Beijing Education Commission began accrediting these schools as such in 2003. Foreign students must not make up over 10% of the student body and they must receive instruction in classes with Chinese students.

As of 1989, the schools had 934,696 students, including 448,167 students enrolled in urban primary schools. As of 1989, the schools had 49,022 teachers, including 24,641 full-time teachers at the urban schools. Curriculum The curriculum of Beijing primary and secondary schools is a mirror of the national curriculum, because under the Education Law of Mainland China, the Ministry of Education coordinates, governs, and plans the curriculum of schools. The Beijing authorities are tasked with implementing the curriculum, because under the Education Act administrative organs at county, township, and administrative village levels implement the curriculum. Since 1993 schools have divided subjects between those locally arranged and those that are state-arranged. All public schools in Beijing, including those catering to minorities, give instruction in Mandarin Chinese. The standard curriculum includes \\"moral education\\" that may be a standalone course or integrated into other courses. Moral education takes up one hour weekly in the primary level, while secondary students have more time per week in moral education. The standard curriculum does not include religion courses. In 2009 the educational authorities inserted components about volunteerism in the curricula of Beijing primary and secondary schools.Johnston, Charles S., Xin Chen and Jing Tian, \\"Beijing's 'People's Olympics': From Slogan to Sustainability\\" - In: Events, Society and Sustainability: Critical and Contemporary Approaches. In: Pernecky, Tomas and Michael L√ºck. Events, Society and Sustainability: Critical and Contemporary Approaches. Routledge, 2012. , 9780415809931. p. 54. Secondary schools in Beijing have also implemented citizenship education.Pan, Suyan, p. 135. School year The school year in Beijing primary and secondary schools is divided into two semesters and schools have five-day-per-week class schedules. In primary schools there are 38 weeks were classes held, and 13 weeks are allotted to student vacations. The primary schools have one week in reserve. Junior secondary schools have 39 weeks for classes with 12 weeks allotted for student vacations. At the junior secondary level, one week is held in reserve. Senior secondary schools have classes held during 39 weeks with vacation being held on 10 or 11 of these weeks. At the senior secondary level, one or two weeks may be held in reserve. Teacher hiring and payment By 2011 the Municipal Education Committee made efforts to equalize the pay rates of primary and secondary teachers to those of government employees as a way of improving teacher retention. As of 2011, each year there is an oversupply of applications for teaching positions at Beijing primary and secondary schools, and most of the applicants had recently graduated from universities in Beijing. Educational attainment and performance In 1989, within Beijing primary schools, the drop out rate was 0.4% and the enrollment rate was 99.5%. Ethnic minorities in Beijing have higher levels of educational attainment than ethnic minorities overall. Within Beijing, 15.8% of ethnic minorities finish their education at the primary level while nationally 45% of ethnic minorities finish at the primary level. The odds ratios, meaning the odds of educational attainment in Beijing are 0.12 at the primary level, 1.35 at the junior secondary level, and 11.35 at the senior secondary level. Key secondary schools Some secondary schools are designated as key secondary schools. Beijing had 63 such schools in 1981.Dong and Chen, p. 125. Vocational secondary schools In Beijing graduates of junior secondary schools may enter vocational secondary schools. These schools utilize a competitive admissions process. Students may complete specific specialties or courses in three or four years. In 1990 there were 131 vocational secondary schools in urban areas, with a total enrollment of 45,204 students, employing 7,084 teachers and serving 45,204 students. At that time, the schools offered 232 specialties. The Beijing government established vocational high schools in 1980. That year, there were 52 of these schools serving 4,400 students. At that time they provided 22 professional courses. In one ten-year period, 64,000 people graduated from vocational schools.

By that year, 41,314 working staff members worked at the schools, which educated around 400,000 students. The enrollment in the nurseries and kindergartens made up 84.5% of urban children above 3 within the designated age group in Beijing. International schools Several international schools opened in Beijing in years prior to 1995. The Beijing Education Commission began monitoring international schools in 1995 and began recognizing them in 1996. In 2010 the BEC listed 19 international schools which accept foreigners. Schools designated as \\"schools for foreign personnel\\" may not accept Mainland Chinese students.

The modern system in recycling land back to farm use and conservation has resulted in the creation of numerous Sites of Special Scientific Interest. History Large areas of peat were laid down on the Somerset Levels, particularly in the River Brue Valley, during the Quaternary period after the ice sheets melted. Extraction The extraction of peat from the Moors is known to have taken place during Roman times, and has been carried out since the Levels were first drained. After the Romans left Britain, from this period forward, peat extraction was undertaken by hand by the owning or tenanted farmers. By the late Victorian period, the Eclipse Peat Company was the main commercial extractor of peat, operating initially across Shapwick Heath. In June 1961, on opening a new areas for peat extraction, peat diggers found one half of a Flatbow. Carbon dated to the Neolithic period, it was given the name the Meare Heath Bow. Tramway There was an extensive narrow gauge tramway operated by the Eclipse Peat Company to take workers to remote locations and then extract heavy loads of cut peat. Developed from 1922, it was initially operated by horses. The tramway had its mainworks at the Broomfield Works, where from the 1930s the company constructed its own locomotives from kits supplied by R.A. Listers of Dursley, based around either Lister diesel or J.A.P. petrol engines. The railway crossed both the Glastonbury Canal and the former Somerset Central Railway from Burnham-on-Sea to Wells, near Ashcott railway station. Merged into the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, west of Ashcott existed \\"Alexander siding\\", which allowed exchange between the SD&JR; and the Eclipse tramway system, and hence distribution of cut peat products across the United Kingdom. In 1949 a British Railways passenger train from Highbridge collided with an Eclipse narrow gauge diesel locomotive crossing on the level and left the track, ending up in the Glastonbury Canal. The tramway was worked for a final time in 1983, after which all transport was undertaken by road. One of the locomotives, Lister 42494, is currently preserved at Twyford Waterworks. Extraction problems, sale to Fisons The introduction of plastic packaging in the 1950s allowed the peat to be packed without rotting, which led to the industrialisation of peat extraction during the 1960s as a major market in horticultural peat was developed. However, the resultant reduction in water levels that resulted put local ecosystems at risk; peat wastage in pasture fields was occurring at rates of 1‚Äì3 feet (0.3‚Äì0.8 m) over 100 years. The need to reduce the amount of peat extracted led to the need for mechanisation, and hence Eclipse agreed to be bought by Fisons in 1961. This was the last year that hand-cutting was used to extract peat, and since this time all cutting has been done by machine. Present Peat extraction on the Somerset Moors continues today, although much reduced. Presently the Fisons Eclipse Peat Works covers , but only are actually worked ‚Äî less than 0.5% of the entire area of the Somerset Levels. Employing 90 people, more are employed in the summer when the peat is turned by hand to allow it to dry. 70% of production is sold in various products to domestic gardeners, while 30% is used for commercial purposes. After the company has finished working an area, it is environmentally restored, and then either resold to the original farmer, or conservationists or private buyers. The system has led to the creation of a number of Sites of Special Scientific Interest, giving a haven to wildlife on the levels.

He became a canon of the Basel M√ºnster in 1510. On February 28, 1527, the cathedral chapter of Basel M√ºnster, meeting at Del√©mont, elected him to be the new Prince-Bishop of Basel, with Pope Clement VII confirming his appointment on August 31, 1527.Profile on catholic- hierarchy.org He was consecrated as a bishop on December 31, 1527. In 1529, the city of Basel became Protestant under the leadership of Johannes Oecolampadius. In 1530, Laufental rebelled against the bishop, but were suppressed using forces from Solothurn. Because of insolvency, the prince- bishopric grew increasingly dependent on the city of Basel, with the city granting him a mortgage on Birseck Castle in 1542, 1544, and 1545. In 1547, Philippe and the city formally agreed to allow the city to choose its own religion, recognizing that the city had already become Protestant. He died in Porrentruy on September 14, 1553.

After making a fortune milling and shipping lumber and timber for California gold miners, Whitcomb launched the first steamship in the U.S. state of Oregon.Ralph Friedman, In Search of Western Oregon. Caldwell, ID: Caxton Printers, 1990; pp. 433‚Äì434. Biography Early years Lot Whitcomb was born in Vermont on April 24, 1807.Howard McKinley Corning (ed.), Dictionary of Oregon History. [1956] Second Edition. Portland, OR: Binford & Mort, 1989; pg. 263. He married the former Irene Chamberlain in 1828, and together they would have four children, all daughters. Around 1830 Whitcomb moved to Michigan, where he began work as a contractor.Eugene E. Snyder, Early Portland: Stump-Town Triumphant: Rival Townsites on the Willamette, 1831-1854. Portland, OR: Binford & Mort, 1951; pg. 56. He subsequently moved to Illinois, where he served a term in the Illinois House of Representatives.\\"History of Illinois, Legislative Roster,\\" in Illinois Blue Book 2011-2012, pg. 409. In the spring of 1847 Whitcomb and his family were part of a party of 13 families leaving Illinois for Missouri in order to take the Oregon Trail to the Oregon Territory, a location which was then receiving considerable attention in the contemporary press.Snyder, Early Portland: Stump-Town Triumphant, pg. 57. This group met up with others seeking to pioneer in Oregon and a massive train of 114 animal-drawn wagons ensued. The party reached Oregon City in November 1847, where Whitcomb would remain for the rest of the year.Snyder, Early Portland: Stump-Town Triumphant, pg. 58. Establishment of Milwaukie Early in 1848 Whitcomb made a donation land claim and made use of parts brought with him on the journey to establish a water-powered sawmill at the confluence of Johnson Creek with the Willamette River. On his claim he platted the town of Milwaukie in 1848. In the summer of 1848 news that gold had been discovered in California made its way to the Willamette Valley and an exodus of fortune-seekers from Oregon ensued.Snyder, Early Portland: Stump-Town Triumphant, pg. 59. Whitcomb decided that a surer path to fortune lay with the manufacture and supply of lumber to the boomtowns of Northern California, however, and he built a schooner, the Milwaukie, and bought a brig, the Forest, to carry lumber and other goods to markets in California. Whitcomb's mill turned out 6,000 board feet of rough 3-inch planks every day in two 12-hour shifts ‚Äî material which brought $300 per thousand board feet in San Francisco, triple the prevailing price in Oregon.Snyder, Early Portland: Stump-Town Triumphant, pg. 61. Whitcomb's fortunes were further enhanced by a flood during the winter of 1849-50, in which many of his competitors in the lumber industry saw their mills washed away or badly damaged by floodwaters. Whitcomb similarly enriched himself with establishment of a flour mill, with which he was able to provide flour to miners at extremely profitable prices. The milling and shipping business proved lucrative and other ships were added to Whitcomb's fleet, including the barks Louisville, Ocean Bird, and Keoka, all added by 1851.Snyder, Early Portland: Stump-Town Triumphant, pg. 62. Whitcomb used some of his profits to launch a newspaper, the Western Star, based in Milwaukie.Charles H. Carey, General History of Oregon Through Early Statehood [1922]. Second Edition. Portland, OR: Binfords & Mort, 1971; pg. 486. This paper would be moved to Portland In 1851 and its name changed to the Oregon Weekly Times. Steamship operator In the same year he started his newspaper, Whitcomb built his steamship, Lot Whitcomb. John C. Ainsworth captained the vessel, which was long and had side wheels that were in diameter.Carey, 'General History of Oregon Through Early Statehood, pg. 741. Jacob Kamm, who installed the steamship's machinery, was the engineer. Whitcomb, in a Western Star editorial on November 21, 1850, promoted the steamboat, meant for \\"river navigation between Oregon City and Pacific City, touching at every point where there is business.\\"Carey, 'General History of Oregon Through Early Statehood, pp. 651‚Äì652. After the ship was launched, it made regular trips between Oregon City and Astoria, at the mouth of the Columbia River. However, river shoals between Milwaukie and Portland made the latter more accessible to large vessels, and Portland soon won the competition for sea-going commerce.Howard McKinley Corning, Willamette Landings [1947]. Third Edition. Portland, OR: Oregon Historical Society, 2004; pg. 16. Whitcomb sold the ship to an Oregon City group, which in turn sold it to the California Steam Navigation Company in 1853 for use on the Sacramento River. Political career Whitcomb's other activities included a term (1852‚Äì53) as Clackamas County representative to the House chamber of the Oregon Territorial Legislature. He served as postmaster at Milwaukie from 1851 through 1857.  Death and legacy  Lot Whitcomb died March 31, 1857. He was 49 years old at the time of his death. After their deaths, Lot and Irene Whitcomb were buried in the private Whitcomb cemetery in Milwaukie but were later moved to River View Cemetery in Portland. Lot Whitcomb Elementary School in Milwaukie is named after Whitcomb. In Oregon City, Lot Whitcomb Drive bears his name. Liberty Ship 1594, SS Lot Whitcomb, was also named after him.

This nude was painted before 1824, and is currently held and exhibited at the Louvre in Paris. Another is at the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin. History The model is seen from the side, seated on a kind of wooden pedestal half covered with a piece of red material. Her left foot rests on a wooden block; her head is turned towards the artist and is therefore seen full face. This nude is painted in a somewhat awkward studio pose. The sitter has been identified (but without certainty) as Mademoiselle Rose, an artists' model who according to Alfred Robaut, Delacroix's biographer, posed several times for him and for Richard Parkes Bonington, and who perhaps distributed her favours impartially between the two artists.A. Robaut, Oeuvre Complete d'Eugene Delacroix: Peintures, Dessins, Gravures, Lithographies, Da Capo Press Inc. (1975), s.v. In a letter to his friend Pierret, usually dated 1820, Delacroix wrote: > I had tried to persuade Felix (Guillemardet) to come and join us tomorrow, > but he said that the shortage of money had got the better of Mademoiselle > Rose's bottom on this occasion.E. Delacroix, Journal de Eug√®ne Delacroix: > Tome 1. 1823-1850, Adamant Media Corporation (2001) ; transl. H. Wellington, > The Journal of Eugene Delacroix (Arts & Letters), Phaidon (1995) This particular nude is represented with an almost naturalistic sincerity, without any decorative arrangement. Although it already displays the variations of light on flesh which interested the artist so deeply, the pigment, applied in masterly touches in a granular impasto, has not yet acquired the fluidity which was to owe to the influence of English painting. This first made itself felt at the salon of 1824, where Delacroix saw works by John Constable, and increased in 1825, the date of his visit to London.D. Bussy, Eugene Delacroix, London (2007),pp.37-48. The upward trend of his work, clearly seen in this painting, brings its date to the period 1820‚Äì1822, but cannot be fixed precisely. However, the nude has not only a pictorial interest: Delacroix brings to the painting an emotion which is firmly rooted in Romanticism. Moreover, the slight timidity of the attitude, the somewhat anxious expression of the face, give to this life-class painting a quality of humanity that is purely French Romantic.M-C.

Founded in 1869, it uses a building constructed in 1858 for one of its two predecessor churches; this building's high-quality architecture has led to its designation as a historic site. In January 1830, Nahum Ward published an advertisement in the Marietta Intelligencer seeking to find other friends of liberal religion, and the resulting group organized as a Unitarian church in the following month.Andrews, Martin R. History of Marietta and Washington County, Ohio and Representative Citizens. Chicago: Biographical, 1902. Members laid the cornerstone of their building in July 1855, and by the time of the building's dedication in June 1857, the congregation had paid approximately $25,000 for lot, materials, furnishings, and labor. The original form of the congregation ceased to exist in May 1869 at its merger with the city's Universalist church, which itself had been founded in 1817 but suffered severe damage to its property in an 1860 flood. The combined church took the name of \\"First Universalist Church of Marietta\\". Built of brick on a stone foundation and featuring additional elements of stone, the First Unitarian Church is a Gothic Revival building. Pilasters divide the facade into three bay, with the doorway in the center, and the side is divided into five. The left bay of the facade, from the perspective of a viewer on the street, is occupied by the base of a square tower nearly twice the height of the rest of the building; while shorter windows in the tower and facade sit below similar second-story windows, and the side windows occupy the height of both stories, tall third- story windows are set near the top of the tower, and the pilasters on all four corners of the tower, similar to those on the rest of the building, are crowned with pointed pinnacles. The building's general shape is that of a front-gable rectangle, with small-size crenellations atop the edges, and the Gothic Revival style is typified by the ogive windows and doorways in the facade and side., Ohio History Connection, 2015. Accessed 2016-01-03. Constructed under the direction of architect John M. Slocomb, the building is one of the region's earliest extant Gothic Revival churches. Both stonework and brickwork were completed by local craftsmen, the bricks being made from clay extracted from Sacra Via, the ceremonial walls built by the Mound Builders near the edge of the Muskingum River.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1392. In October 1973, the church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its architecture and its close connection to Nahum Ward, who was deemed a significant resident of nineteenth-century Marietta. It was the last of four Marietta locations to be listed on the Register in 1973, following the Mound Cemetery Mound in February and the Wilcox-Mills House and Erwin Hall at Marietta College in April. It is also a part of the Marietta Historic District, listed on the Register in 1974, which embraces more than two thousand buildings across of the city.

Seleucid kings conducted a considerable reconstruction effort in the sacred ground of Lagina and transformed it into a foremost religious center of its time, with the nearby (at a distance of 11 kilometers) site of Stratonicea becoming the administrative center. The two sites (Lagina and Stratoniceakeia) were connected to each other in antiquity by a holy path.

'Watkinsoni', a lily first hybridised by John Horsefield John Horsefield (18 July 1792 ‚Äì 6 March 1854) was an English handloom weaver and amateur botanist after whom the daffodil Narcissus 'Horsfieldii' is named. Horsefield had little formal schooling, and acquired most of his botanical knowledge through self-study and involvement in local botanical groups, which provided a venue for working class people to share knowledge, in part by pooling money to purchase books. Horsefield founded one such society, the Prestwich Botanical Society, and was later president of a larger botanical society covering a wide area around north Manchester. He made several botanical discoveries and cultivated two new plants. A number of his writings about the working class and also some poetry were published, but nothing concerning botany other than in connection with the subject of the working class. He lived most of his life near Whitefield in Lancashire, in dire poverty. At the time of his death he had been married for 42 years and had fathered eleven children.  Early life  Born on 18 July 1792, John Horsefield was the eldest son of Charles Horsefield, a barely literate man from whom he received encouragement in his early botanical interests. He reminisced in later life that both his father and his grandfather had been interested in botany and in floriculture.Cash (2011), p. 67. His birthplace was probably Besses o' th' Barn in Whitefield close to Prestwich, which became his home. His mother claimed he was born \\"dead\\" and had to be revived; his childhood was dogged by poor health.Secord, \\"Horsefield, John (1792 ‚Äì 1854), botanist and weaver\\". Horsefield learned to read during a single year's attendance at school when he was six, after which he went to work for a gingham weaver. His education continued with twice-weekly evening tuition in writing and arithmetic until he was around 15 years old. James Cash, a journalist, amateur botanist and the first chairman of the Manchester Cryptogamic Society,Manchester Museum Herbarium (2010) says Horsefield received some education for a short time when he started work: the weaver for whom he served charged two shillings (10p) per calendar quarter to instruct his young employees in reading. This instruction took the form of the employees reading out lessons to him while they worked at their handlooms. An avid reader, his interest in botany was piqued when he obtained a copy of Nicholas Culpeper's 1653 book, The Complete Herbal, of which he said, \\"The wonderful properties that are there ascribed to plants excited in me a strong desire to get acquainted with the plants themselves.\\" Thereafter he attended working-men's botanical societies and meetings in public houses,Cash (2011), pp. 67‚Äì68. thus meeting a broad church of people with interests not only in the science of botany but also in floriculture, herbalism and horticulture.Secord (1996), p. 383. Horsefield and his father were members of an early 19th-century loose grouping of Mancunian amateur botanists, and of a short-livedCash (2011), p. 73. botanical society for working men in Whitefield. Horsefield attended meetings of the former group in 1808, which was referred to as the \\"Manchester Society of Botanists\\" or the \\"Botanist Society\\". Anne Secord, a historian of 19th century popular science, quotes an attendee of the society, Thomas Heywood, who describes it as being \\"without any regular place of meeting, without funds, without books and without rules; a sort of members, but no body, having only one object in common ‚Äì their love of plants\\".Secord (1994), pp. 275, 277. The Whitefield society arranged for funds to be pooled to buy books for communal use, enabling the 16-year-old Horsefield to read James Lee's 1760 work, An Introduction to Botany. It provided information on Linnaean taxonomy as it applied to plants, and from it Horsefield copied details onto a piece of paper he pinned to his loom to commit them to memory while he was working. He earned the respect of other botanists for his abilities in the sphere of collection and identification of species and was the first to find the Entosthodon templetoni moss in England.Cash (2011), pp. 69‚Äì70. Horsfield met his future wife Esther Eccorsley (1793/94 ‚Äì 1872) at a botanical meeting in 1812. The couple were married on 20 December 1812 at St Mary's Church, Oldham.Secord (1994), p. 282.  Leadership  The meetings he attended in his early life were a part of a movement in the study of botany by artisans. This had been initiated by George Caley, James Crowther, John Dewhurst, John Mellor and Edward Hobson, the last of whom Horsefield met in 1809 at a meeting held at Radcliffe Bridge and whose knowledge he held in high regard.Cash (2011), p. 42.Secord (1994), p. 277. It was part of a broader working class movement involving the study of nature and natural history that developed in the late 18th century and continued into the next.Secord (1996), p. 378. There is some evidence to suggest that in the period of social unrest that followed the end of the Napoleonic Wars, and which saw the introduction of the Seditious Meetings Act, gatherings of botanists may have been used as cover for the activities of politically radical reformers such as Samuel Bamford. Horsefield, who witnessed the Peterloo Massacre of 1819, had such sympathies and recounted that The Peterloo Massacre was the last political meeting Horsefield attended,Cash (2011), p. 20. although he retained a general interest in the subject of radical politics. He attended the Manchester Mechanics' Institute,Manchester Guardian (1904), p. 12. supported the idea of self-education and, according to Harvey Taylor, a historian, \\"typified the Lancashire autodidactic seeker after self- culture.\\"Taylor (1997), p. 94. Having obtained his own garden in 1819, he promoted his interests by founding the Prestwich Botanical Society on 11 September 1820,Grindon (1882), p. 199. presiding over meetings in a pub where plant specimens were brought together for identification and where those who could not read were taught the science of botany by those who could. He was president of the society for 32 years,Grindon (1882), p. 192. during which time at least 131 books were purchased by the society for communal use.Secord (1996), p. 381. Writing in December 1829, Horsefield explained that the Prestwich Society met on the second Monday of each month and usually had between 12 and 20 members, who were charged a monthly 6d. (2¬Ωp) subscription.Horsefield (1830), p. 393. The subscription, which was common to such societies, was intended to pay for books and create a fund for the purchase of drink; the pub landlord provided the meeting and storage space at no charge as long as sufficient drink was consumed, a practice known as \\"wet rent\\".Secord (1994), p. 279. In 1830 he succeeded Hobson as president of an organisation with a wider geographical base and which held Sunday meetings in pubs for the purpose of educating the amateur artisan botanists. The Manchester botanist Leo Grindon (1818‚Äì1904)Weiss (1930), pp. 16‚Äì22. described this body as \\"the united societies of the whole district\\", while another, Richard Buxton, who led an impoverished life like Horsefield, referred to it as the \\"General Botanical Meetings\\" whose gatherings took place at venues between Clayton, Eccles, Manchester, Middleton, Newton Heath and Radcliffe.Buxton (1849), p. vi. Horsefield explained the didactic purpose of these societies as He noted how the procedure for imparting the knowledge had to be changed such that, certainly by the 1850s and possibly as early as 1830, the president's role was to select specimens from those brought to the meeting and identify them to the attendees, who sat in silence. Horsefield describes this change as being necessary because previously the president He championed these working people in print, praising their self-taught skills, demanding they be accorded the respect of others working in the botanical field and using them as an example to counter generalised accusations such as those made by John Claudius Loudon that the textile workers of Lancashire were ignorant and degraded.Horsefield (1830), pp. 392‚Äì395. He composed verses,Cash (2011), p. 75. including The Botanists' Song, which acknowledged the conviviality obtained from meeting in pubs with the words \\"science circles with the glass\\". But he did not produce any written works directly relating to botany, and in 1847 turned down the opportunity to write on the flora of Manchester with Buxton, whom he met in 1826 while they were independently studying plant life on Kersal Moor and whom he introduced to the Prestwich Botanical Society. Buxton was of the opinion that Horsefield was \\"not a mere country herbalist, but an excellent scientific botanist\\", and the 1826 meeting presented Buxton with opportunities to meet a like-minded circle of men where previously his had been a solitary pursuit.Hogg (1849), p. 223.Buxton (1849), pp. v‚Äìxi. Horsefield did not confine his scientific interests to botany, as he also studied algebra, mensuration and astronomy. Charles Horsefield had also encouraged his son in the last pursuit, taking him to meet Robert Ward, an astronomer in Blackley who had a telescope.Chapman (1998), p. 182. John Horsefield developed an interest in the subject to the extent that he constructed an orrery, much to the bewilderment of his neighbours. Cash notes that when constructing his orrery, Horsefield asked a local man to manufacture a golden ball to represent the sun and the man replied that \\"Aw'll mak' thee one an' charge thee now't for't; but, let me tell thee, fancy folk like thee 're a'lus poor\\". Indeed, he was: all of his interests were indulged despite a background of dire poverty, and he remarked of his celebrity in botanical circles that \\"fame is not bread\\". He remained a gingham weaver and during his lifetime the sole financial benefit from his interests came when he raised a new hybrid lilyPaxton (1848), pp. 51‚Äì52. ‚Äì Tigridia conchiflora ‚Äì in his garden and sold it to a Manchester nurseryman, Thomas Watkinson, for ¬£10. His poverty caused him to be exempted from contributing to the book fund of the Prestwich Botanical Society from the mid-1820s, and he was later exempted from paying into the liquor funds of both that society and the wider-based group. These concessions demonstrate the extent to which his knowledge was appreciated and occurred despite the teetotal Hobson having to pay into a liquor fund of which by definition he took no advantage.Secord (1994), pp. 280‚Äì281, 307 fn. 81. Horsefield received ¬£13 10s. from a subscription that was started in 1853 in another attempt to alleviate his penurious state. After his death on 6 March 1854, Esther, with whom he had six sons and five daughters, received ¬£37 from this fund, and he left 37 bulbs of one of the earliest hybrid daffodils to be cultivated, Narcissus horsefieldii, that raised another ¬£2 11s (¬£2.55).Whittingham (2011), pp. 161‚Äì162. N. horsefieldii became one of the most popular and extensively grown varieties of daffodil.Walker (1936), p. 40.  Death  John Horsefield died on 6 March 1854, aged 62, probably as a consequence of a strangulated hernia that had been masked by a tumour. He was buried on 10 March 1854 at the St. Mary's Church, Prestwich, although at some point in his life it seems that he had upset the authorities of the established church for reasons unknown.Percy (1991), p. 7. His table tomb was listed as a Grade II monument by English Heritage in 2012. The epitaph on his tomb was written by Charles Swain (1807‚Äì1874). It reads: John Horsefield's gravestone Bamford commemorated him in a poem written in 1855,Bamford (1864), pp. 130‚Äì132. and Grindon wrote in 1882 that Horsefield was \\"one of the most celebrated of the old Lancashire operative botanists\\". Esther died on 17 June 1872. Their son, James, and his wife, Alice, are also commemorated on the headstone.

It may also be called the Bionda di Cuneo, after the comune of Cuneo or the surrounding province; Bionda di Villanova, after the comune of Villanova d'Asti in the province of Asti; Rossa delle Crivelle, after a village near Buttigliera d'Asti; or Nostralina. History The Bionda Piemontese was once widely distributed in Piemonte. In the 1960s, industrialisation and intensive agriculture caused a decline in the breed, which is suitable only for free-range management. Recovery began in 1999 under the auspices of the Istituto Professionale per l'Agricoltura e l'Ambiente (professional institute for agriculture and the environment) of Verzuolo, in the province of Cuneo. A breed standard was approved by the Federazione Italiana Associazioni Avicole, the federation of Italian poultry associations, in May 2007, based in part on a description of the breed by Vittorino Vezzani in an article published in 1938. Breed numbers remain low. A study published in 2007 used a figure of approximately 1400 for the total breeding stock, of which approximately 400 were cocks. Characteristics The Bionda Piemontese is buff, with either a black or a blue tail. It has yellow skin and legs; the ear-lobes vary from yellow to creamy white. The comb is single and large, with 4‚Äì6 points. Average weight is for cocks, for hens. The eggs are pinkish brown and weigh 55‚Äì60 g. Ring size is 18 mm for cocks, 16 mm for hens. Uses The Bionda Piemontese is a dual-purpose breed. Hens lay 180‚Äì200 eggs per year. The Bionda Piemontese grows fast. In meat production, birds may reach their final weight at about 16 weeks, or be slaughtered at about 10 weeks at a weight of 1.5 kg. The Bionda Piemontese is used in the production of the Cappone di Morozzo, or capon of Morozzo, a traditional agricultural product raised under strict conditions in the comuni of Morozzo, Margarita, Castelletto Stura, Montanera, Sant'Albano Stura, Trinit√†, Magliano Alpi, Rocca de' Baldi, Mondov√¨, Villanova Mondov√¨, Pianfei, Beinette and Cuneo. Capons are slaughtered at no less than 220 days, and weigh 2‚Äì2.7 kg. The combs and wattles removed during caponisation, at about 10 weeks, are an essential ingredient of the traditional Piedmontese dish la Finanziera.

She resides in the Orlando, Florida area and is a noted cellist in the region and co-founder and artistic director of the Metropolitan Area Youth Symphony.  Early life  May was born in Sanborn, Iowa. May's parents are Daryle and Marian Getting. May is the youngest of six children.  Education  As a young student, May studied cello with Mary Eleanor May, whose son Jonathan May was also a cellist in a musical household. May moved to Colorado, where she graduated with a degree in Cello Performance from Colorado State University.  Career  In Colorado, the May and her husband founded the Canyon Youth Orchestra and adopted a lifelong philosophy of community involvement through music. After 1988, May moved to Tennessee, where she started the Cumberland String Project‚Äîthe program introduced strings and music education to an area that otherwise had no music education in the schools or community. In the early 1990s, May moved to Central Florida, where she continued to teach strings, help her husband expand his burgeoning youth orchestras, and gave birth to two more children. As an accomplished cellist, May quickly joined the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra and the Bach Festival Orchestra. May was the orchestra director at Maitland Middle School and Winter Park High School, and also started the strings program at Park Maitland School. Despite a terrible car accident that threatened her career as a cellist and music teacher, she would also teach music at Millennium Middle School in Sanford, Florida and build a comprehensive strings program with Jonathan at Trinity Preparatory School, where she has worked for the last 10 years. She also performs with her own chamber group the Dolce Chamber Players and is a frequent performer at area events, including Walt Disney World's Candlelight Processional. She has also performed in accompanying orchestras with many notable pop musicians such as Jimmy Page, Harry Connick Jr., Donny Osmond, Smokey Robinson, as well as famous tenors Luciano Pavarotti and Andrea Bocelli. In 2010, after May's husband died, she continued to teach and play professionally, and assumed a leadership role in some of the programs that she helped create with Jonathan, including the strings program at Trinity Prep. May has also been instrumental in paying tribute to her husband, and has participated in several tributes performed by Central Florida orchestras. The first number of the OPO's November, 2010 \\"Myth and Poetry\\" program was dedicated to Jonathan May; Maureen played cello during the program. Upon completion of The Phoenix Rising, a Stella Sung piece commissioned years earlier by Jonathan, Orlando Phil maestro Christopher Wilkins walked into the orchestra and gave Maureen a warm embrace. May is now in her second term as a Musician Board Member of the Orlando Philharmonic Board of Directors and serves as Chair of the Musician Board on the Philharmonic's Executive Board. She also has maintained a private studio for over twenty-five years.  Metropolitan Area Youth Symphony  After Jonathan May's passing in February, 2010, in addition to her own professional obligations May assumed some of the duties her late husband. Along with longtime family friend, colleague, and fellow conductor, Michael Miller, they comprised the artistic staff of the Florida Young Artists Orchestra and shared duties as co-Artistic Directors. The orchestra was founded by Jonathan after he left his position as Artistic Director of the Florida Symphony Youth Orchestra in 1998, and Maureen helped him form the new orchestra out of their living room, along with help of other parents, music teachers, and young musicians. Though the Orlando area already possessed one youth orchestra, Jonathan explained to the Orlando Sentinel about the need to form a new one: \\"What this is is a difference of philosophy. One is a strong musical director with a supporting board; the other is a weak musical director and a strong board calling the shots.\\" In what would become a foundation of their educational philosophy, the Mays insisted on strong musical direction in all their programs. After participating in the final concerts for the FYAO in 2010, both artistic directors left the orchestra. As Maureen later explained to Trinity Voice, the orchestra abandoned the vision of her husband and sought to create a strong board with weak musical directors: \\"Jonathan May trusted for years in multiple orchestras. Like the FSYO before it, the FYAO had Mr. May's influence; but neither orchestra retained his vision or spirit.\\" In 2010, under the executive direction of her daughter and fellow music teacher, Emily May, Maureen May and Michael Miller of The Geneva School in Winter Park, formed the Metropolitan Area Youth Symphony in honor of Jonathan May. With Maureen May and Michael Miller serving as Artistic Directors, the MAYS set out to continue Jonathan May's inclusive music educational philosophy, and states on its website: \\"The MAYS is dedicated to his honor and maintaining the high musical, educational, and ethical ideals that he brought with him to each of his orchestras and students. The founding of the MAYS occurred on May 1st, 2010, which was designated by the government of Orange County, Florida as Mr. Jonathan May Day. The first Mr. Jonathan May Day celebration was held at Trinity Preparatory School on May 1, 2010, with the proclamation read live to the crowd by District Five Orange County Commissioner Bill Segal and presented to Maureen. The MAYS celebrated Mr. May Day 2011 with its inaugural season finale concert that attracted hundreds and featured the world Premiere of Robert Kerr's \\"Elegy,\\" dedicated to Susan Goldman and inspired by Jonathan May, on which Maureen May played solo cello. On May 14, 2011, Maureen and her children, as well as students of the MAYS and other area youth orchestras joined onstage the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra as they honored Jonathan May at its sellout final concert featuring violinist Joshua Bell. The world premiere performance of the piece, Tall and Small, a commissioned work by Jonathan's brother, Daniel May, is named to reflect the wide impact May's passion for music had on children and adults alike. The Make Music-Make History competition featured hundreds of students submitting YouTube auditions, with live audition recordings conducted by the MAYS. Seated at the front of the orchestra in front of the sellout audience, Maureen played the piece's cello solo on Jonathan's cello, with the music culminating in a resolution that the Orlando Sentinel described as \\"that moment when the sun emerges after a long stretch of rain.\\" The MAYS is in its fifth season and continues to grow. Maureen May explains its success as being a combination of her husband's philosophy and the community of Central Florida: \\"My goal with starting [MAYS] was just to make sure that his educational approach was furthered. My main goal is to include people from all around Florida‚Ä¶The overwhelming support the MAYS has received from the community, including musicians and teachers, parents and students, has confirmed to us that there is not only room for three orchestras in the area, but a need for such diversity.\\" In 2012, 501(c)(3) organization, The Jonathan May Foundation, was founded to support the students of the MAYS and further Jonathan May's educational ideals. May has a permanent seat on the Board of Directors.  Personal life  In 1983, May married Jonathan May, also a cellist. They have four children, Emily (b.1987), Elliot (b.1988), Allison (b.1990), and Nathan (b.1994). On February 27, 2010, May's husband died at 51 years old.

It is defined as being of two minds about the meaning of the four noble truths; it functions as a basis for not becoming involved with wholesome activities.Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 786-787.Kunsang (2004), p. 26. Vicikitsa is identified as: * One of the five hindrances that impede meditation * One of the six root unwholesome mental factors within the Mahayana Abhidharma teachings * One of the fourteen unwholesome mental factors within the Theravada Abhidhamma teachings * One of the ten fetters in the Theravada tradition Explanations Theravada Nina van Gorkom explains: :The reality of vicikicchƒÅ is not the same as what we mean by doubt in conventional language. VicikicchƒÅ is not doubt about someone's name or about the weather. VicikicchƒÅ is doubt about realities, about nƒÅma and r≈´pa, about cause and result, about the four noble Truths, about the ‚ÄúDependent Origination‚Äù.Gorkom (2010), Definition of conceit The AtthasƒÅlinƒ´ (II, Part IX, Chapter III, 259) defines vicikicchƒÅ as follows: : ...It has shifting about as characteristic, mental wavering as function, indecision or uncertainty in grasp as manifestation, unsystematic thought (unwise attention) as proximate cause, and it should be regarded as a danger to attainment. Mahayana The Abhidharma-samuccaya states: :What is vicikitsa? It is to be in two minds about the truth, and its function is to serve as a basis for not becoming involved with positive things. Herbert Guenther explains: :Indecision [vicikitsa] is the mental event in which one oscillates between two extremes concerning the four truths and the relationship between one's action and its result. This indecision creates obstacles for everything positive and in particular for the vision of the truth. Alexander Berzin explains: :Indecisive wavering (the-tshoms, doubt) is entertaining two minds about what is true ‚Äì in other words, wavering between accepting or rejecting what is true. What is true refers to such facts as the four noble truths and behavioral cause and effect.

Indecisive wavering functions as a basis for not engaging with what is constructive.Berzin (2006) Chogyam Trungpa states that vicikitsa (doubt) means \\"you do not trust any possible alternatives and do not want advice or any way out\\".

In 1429 it was promoted to become a county.  Geography  The territory of Hanau stretched along the northern bank of the Main river from east of Frankfurt am Main to east of Hanau. This area was called \\"Amt Buchen\\". From the 13th century it grew to include areas in the valley of the Kinzig, in the Spessart mountains, areas north of Frankfurt and south of the Main river around Babenhausen.  The Beginnings  In documents issued by the Archbishop of Mainz from 1122 two witnesses named after the castle of Wachenbuchen or simply \\"Buchen\\" (today part of the town of Maintal) are listed several times. They were Dammo of Buchen and his brother Siegebodo of Buchen. Dammo later called himself Dammo of Hanau. Hanau was a castle erected in a sharp bend of the Kinzig river a short distance before it flows into the Main river. The oldest mention of the castle dates to 1143. Dammo had a son who called himself Arnold of Hanau.  Hanau family and its territory  Starting in 1166/68 a noble family arose who initially titled themselves after the castle of Dorfelden, but ‚Äì starting in 1191 ‚Äì they took on the title \\"of Hanau\\". The relationship between the families \\"of Buchen\\" and \\"of Dorfelden\\" is not clear. But since this time, the Genealogy of the \\"of Hanau\\" family is documented without interruption until the last male member died in 1736. Starting with Reinhard I the territory of Hanau was enlarged by a series of profitable marriages and political moves usually executed in alliance with the archbishop and elector of Mainz. Reinhard I married Adelheid of M√ºnzenberg, daughter of Ulrich II of Hagen-M√ºnzenberg. The family of Hagen-M√ºnzenberg was not a noble one but of ministerialis origine and immensely wealthy. Ulrich II of Hagen-M√ºnzenberg had no male heirs but six daughters instead. So most of the inheritance was divided between five of the daughters (the sixth one became Abbess of a convent founded for her). The remaining inheritance, including the castle of M√ºnzenberg, were co-owned by the daughters and their families. Hanau inherited land in and around Babenhausen and lands within the Wetterau. Babenhausen was the only larger part of the Lordship of Hanau located south of the Main river. Another part of the M√ºnzenberg inheritance was the name \\"Ulrich\\": All subsequent heads of the house of Hanau bore this name. Reinhard I took part in a war archbishop Werner von Eppstein of Mainz fought against the counts of Rieneck, their main stronghold being the Spessart mountains. The counts of Rieneck lost and had to cede territory as well as a daughter, Elisabeth of Rieneck-Rothefels, to Hanau. She was married to Ulrich I, son of Reinhard I. Through this connection the house of Hanau inherited again in 1290: namely the area around Steinau in the upper valley of the Kinzig river. In 1300 Ulrich I was furthermore appointed governor of Wetterau by king Albrecht I, an area north of Buchen and Hanau. He and his descendants retained this office up to his grandson Ulrich III. On 2 February 1303 the king promoted the settlement of Hanau which had developed in front of the Hanau castle to the level of a town and granted it the right to hold a market. During the 14th century a protective wall was built around the town. In 1320 king Ludwig the Bavarian transferred the district of Bornheimerberg, an area to the north and north- west of Frankfurt to Ulrich II as a security for a loan. Due to the lack of money neither the king nor any of his successors was able to claim it back. But the king also gave it as a security to the city of Frankfurt. This led to a feud between the Lords of Hanau and the City of Frankfurt which was resolved only in the 15th century by dividing Bornheimer Berg between the two parties. In 1434 emperor Sigismund changed the part held by Hanau into a fief. In 1377 the Lordship of Hanau inherited more Rieneck territory: the abbey and the district of Schl√ºchtern, the castle and district of Schwarzenfels and the district of Brandenstein - all located north-east of the existing Hanau territory - as well as the district of Lohrhaupten located south east of the Lordship of Hanau in the Spessart range.  Late medieval  During the great plague, in 1349, the Jewish community in Hanau was massacred. Only two years later, in 1351, King Charles IV granted Ulrich III of Hanau the right to the protection taxes paid by the Jewish community within Hanau territory. After some earlier regulations the house of Hanau granted itself a statute of primogeniture in 1375: Only the first born male inherited the Lordship. All other sons and all unmarried daughters had to join monasteries or convents. This statute was one of the earliest within Germany. It aimed to stabilize the territorial integrity of the Lordship of Hanau by avoiding subdivisions among heirs. The \\"foreign\\" policy in the second half of the 14th century saw the Lords of Hanau ‚Äì especially Ulrich III ‚Äì in permanent conflict with the neighbouring city of Frankfurt. At one point Ulrich III was acting as representative of the emperor in the city and had laid claim to the imperial forest to the south of the city as well as the northern city districts of Bornheimerberg and Bockenheim. The city of Frankfurt, using its financial power by granting the emperor a large credit, managed to have Ulrich III removed as imperial representative and to take over the forest. The Lordship of Hanau kept most of area north of Frankfurt but never had another opportunity to take over Frankfurt itself again.  Becoming Counts  Hanau remained an ally of the emperors. As a reward in 1429 emperor Sigismund granted Reinhard II of Hanau the title of a count. From this time on the Lordship of Hanau is called the County of Hanau.

That means the solution to the primal (minimization) problem is always greater than or equal to the solution to an associated dual problem. This is opposed to strong duality which only holds in certain cases.. Uses Many primal-dual approximation algorithms are based on the principle of weak duality.. Weak duality theorem The primal problem: : Maximize cTx subject to A x ‚â§ b, x ‚â• 0; The dual problem, : Minimize bTy subject to ATy ‚â• c, y ‚â• 0. The weak duality theorem states cTx ‚â§ bTy. Namely, if (x_1,x_2,....,x_n) is a feasible solution for the primal maximization linear program and (y_1,y_2,....,y_m) is a feasible solution for the dual minimization linear program, then the weak duality theorem can be stated as \\\\sum_{j=1}^n c_j x_j \\\\leq \\\\sum_{i=1}^m b_i y_i , where c_j and b_i are the coefficients of the respective objective functions.

His parents, John and Mary Johnston Thornton, raised twelve children in central Ohio and were respected farmers in the local communities.

Thornton was an avid reader and left home at the age of 19 to pursue an education: he worked constantly and studied, spending a term at Bloomington College (now, University of Indiana at Bloomington) and teaching preparatory classes (1835).Theophilus Adam Wylie, Indiana University: Its history from 1820, when founded, to 1890 : With biographical sketches of its presidents, professors and graduates : And a list of its students from 1820 to 1887 After Thornton's family moved to the Logansport, Indiana, area, in 1836, he worked with the engineers building the Erie Canal that ran from Bloomington to the Ohio River in southern Indiana. Practicing law Thornton subsequently moved to southern Indiana and read law in the office of prominent local attorney, John A. Brackenridge. When Abraham Lincoln was reading law, the future president visited the courtroom to hear Brackenridge‚Äôs oratory and later borrowed books. Thornton excelled in his studies and was named justice of the peace for Warrick County, Indiana (1842).History of Warrick, Spencer, and Perry Counties, Indiana: from the earliest time to the present; Together with interesting biographical sketches, reminiscences, notes; Goodspeed, 1885 However, by the end of the 1840s, Thornton began hearing glowing reports from family members and friends who had travelled to Texas and told of the availability of land and new opportunities. Thornton was sold and packed his family off to Seguin, Texas, where he opened a land office and practiced law. Texas Over the next decade, Thornton‚Äôs business boomed: he served as clerk to the mayor and board of aldermen and was county representative to the state temperance society.The Texan Mercury. (Seguin, Tex.), Vol. 1, No. 5, Ed. 1 Saturday, October 15, 1853 He also served as secretary of the board of trustees of the Guadalupe Male and Female College.The Texan Mercury. (Seguin, Tex.), Vol. 2, No. 38, Ed. 1 Saturday, June 16, 1855 Thornton's letters home attracted other family members and friends to the area. In 1853 his brother Harvey visited the area to take photographs and tour the area; however, after a few letters home, he was never heard from again. The Brackenridges became interested in the area and moved to join their Thornton cousins: James Thornton had married the sister of John A. Brackenridge‚Äôs wife, uniting the two families. From this beginning, the Brackenridges would grow to become powerful bankers, builders, landowners, feminists, and philanthropists in the San Antonio, Texas, and Austin, Texas, communities. During the American Civil War, however, the Thornton family was pro-Union, which created local hostility. For safety, the family moved to Minnesota to wait out the war. After his brother, Henry Harrison Thornton, was killed at the Battle of Stone River, Thornton decided to enlist in the Union Army and, with his connections, received an appointment to the Quartermaster Corps and was named commissary of the brigade, serving under General Nathaniel P. Banks. While on his way to the Siege of Vicksburg, Thornton became ill and was forced to return to Minnesota to recuperate. After the war, for health reasons, his doctors advised that he return to Texas. Military reconstruction Upon returning to Texas, which was under a provisional government, Thornton was appointed judge of the 24th District Court and oversaw the re-imposition of federal authority, including forcing former Confederates to swear allegiance to the United States in order to conduct business and to vote. This undoubtedly resulted in hostility towards the family and great stress which took a toll on Thornton‚Äôs health. After approximately ten years on the bench, he suffered a stroke and partial paralysis from which he never recovered. Thornton also enumerated the 1870 Census for Seguin, Texas.See 1870 Census Thornton was buried at the Old Denman Place, Guadalupe County, Texas. The land was part of the estate of Thornton‚Äôs brother-in-law and Texas pioneer, politician, and businessman, Claiborne West, signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence.

Hinde (July 12, 1832 ‚Äì March 10, 1915) was an American industrialist, tycoon, riverboat captain, businessman, and entrepreneur. He managed many businesses and invested in numerous business ventures over the course of his life. Hinde served in executive leadership positions in the river navigation, shipping, railroad, and hotel businesses. By his late forties, Hinde had already amassed a great fortune from his work in the steamboat and railroad industries. In the late 1880s Hinde was invited to San Diego by his close friend E. S. Babcock to invest in and run several businesses, including the Hotel del Coronado and the Spreckels Brothers Commercial Company with John D. Spreckels. Hinde vastly increased his personal fortune during his time in southern California, and he helped spur the economy of the region. Towards the end of his life he donated much of his wealth to further various projects in the Californian city of Coronado and its surrounding area, some dedicated to the memory of his daughter Camilla, who died in Evansville, Indiana, at the age of 13. Early years Hinde was born in Urbana, Ohio, on July 12, 1832. He was one of six children born to Thomas S. Hinde (1785‚Äì1846) and Sara Cavileer Hinde (1791‚Äì1847). His grandfather was Dr. Thomas Hinde (1737‚Äì1828) who had distinguished himself during the American Revolutionary War and during his service to General James Wolfe. During the early years of Hinde's life the family was constantly on the move, because his father was a circuit preacher of the Methodist faith and was speculating in military real estate in the territories purchased from the Native Americans by Willam Henry Harrison. Eventually, Hinde's father purchased a large tract of land in southern Illinois where he founded a town and settled with his family. Hinde attended elementary and middle school in Mount Carmel, Illinois, a town his father founded in 1815. The Hinde family were large landowners in Mount Carmel and Wabash County, Illinois. A portion of the family land was located on the Wabash River and included Hanging Rock and the Grand Rapids Dam. Hinde attended Indiana Asbury University (now DePauw University) in Greencastle for a year and a half before dropping out following the deaths of his father and mother.The Ladies' Repository, Volume 12. (Google eBook), L. Swormstedt and J. H. Power, 1852. Hinde, his brother Edmund C. Hinde, and his sister Belinda Hinde were forced to live with other relatives or fend for themselves. For a short time in the 1850s, Hinde and his younger sister Belinda lived with their older sister, Martha, and her husband, Judge Charles H. Constable, in Mount Carmel and in Marshall, Illinois.1850 Federal Census. As a college dropout, Hinde was initially only able to find work as a grocery clerk in Vincennes and later as a clerk in Mount Carmel. Even though these were low-paying jobs, Hinde was able to support himself because he had inherited large land holdings from his father.Smythe, William Ellsworth. \\"San Diego and Imperial Counties, California: A Record of Settlement, Organization, Progress and Achievement\\", Volume 2. (Google eBook) The S.J. Clarke Publishing Company, 1913. Employment in river navigation steamboat of the type used on the Mississippi river system, from an 1850s daguerrotype Hinde's first employment in river transportation was as a clerk on a boat that operated between St. Louis, Missouri, and St. Paul, Minnesota. After about a year, he joined the Galena, Dubuque and St. Paul Packet Company, which became one of the largest transportation companies in that part of the country. At one point during his employment there, he contracted cholera and almost died. Hinde made rapid advancement and was promoted to the position of captain in his mid- twenties, an unusually young age. In 1862, he went to Louisville, Kentucky, to take command of a steamer running from there to Memphis, Tennessee. He returned to St. Louis in 1864 to serve as captain of the steamer Davenport, which ran from St. Louis to St. Paul, before resigning that position to organize a branch of the Halliday Brothers Corporation in Cairo, Illinois, which was engaged in the river transportation and shipping businesses. He subsequently established his own business and became the shipping agent at the Cairo wharf for all the steamboat lines passing through Cairo, on both the Ohio River and Mississippi River and their tributaries.St. Louis & Memphis Packet Co. v. Parker, 59 Ill. 23 (1871). Hinde sold his interests in the business shortly after its creation and moved his family to Evansville, Indiana, where he became acquainted with E. S. Babcock and the Reid Brothers. Railroad business B & O stock certificate, 1903 Steamboats began to see strong competition from the railroads after the post-Civil War replacement of the rail lines, and after a brief episode of poor health in 1870, Hinde sold his interests in the river navigation business and turned his attention to railroads. He went to Louisville, Kentucky, to rest, and by chance became a shipping agent for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company through his close relationship with several company executives. Hinde secured various contracts for hauling grain, a business he may have gained some insight into from his brother Edmund C. Hinde (1830‚Äì1909), who was then active in the grain business in their hometown of Mount Carmel. But the endeavor was unsuccessful, and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad went into receivership; Hinde arranged to have all his shipments transferred to the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad Company. Shortly before he received an invitation from E. S. Babcock to move to Coronado, California, Hinde's only child, Camilla, died in Evansville at the age of 13.The Cairo Daily Bulletin, January 28, 1879. Babcock had founded the Hotel del Coronado and several large companies, and invited Hinde to invest and help manage his business interests. Hinde had been engaged in the railroad business for a little under a decade when he left for southern California to invest with John Diedrich Spreckels and E. S. Babcock in the real estate and hotel businesses. In the following years, Hinde and Spreckels launched numerous successful business ventures together and became good friends.MacMullen, Jerry. \\"They Came By Sea: A Pictorial History of San Diego Bay\\". W. Ritchie Press, 1969. Southern California Front view of the Hotel del Coronado In Evansville, Hinde had become acquainted with the Reid Brothers, who designed many notable structures there, including the Willard Library. When Hinde and Babcock left Evansville and relocated to Coronado, they took the Reid Brothers with them, and hired them to design many structures including the Hotel del Coronado. Hinde also used the Reid brothers for personal projects, such as his home in Coronado and the church and rectory he built in the town.Flannigan, Kathleen. The Journal of San Diego History, Winter 1987, Volume 33, Number 1.Olten, Carol. \\"Hinde Site and Foresight,\\" The San Diego Union, September 13, 1987. All three structures still stand today.

The building burned down in 1929.Nolan, John Matthew. \\"2,543 Days: A History of the Hotel at the Grand Rapids Dam on the Wabash River\\", pp. 30‚Äì45. In California, Hinde again became involved in various businesses and investments. Initially, he was the commercial agent and manager for the Santa Fe Wharf, working with Spreckels and Babcock. Later, he was one of the founders of the Spreckels Brothers Commercial Company, owning a one-third interest. The company imported coal, cement, and general merchandise. Hinde's most important and lasting investment was the Hotel del Coronado on Rancho San Diego Island, which was owned by the Coronado Beach Company, originally capitalized with US$3 million. At the time of capitalization the company directors were Babcock, Spreckels, Hinde, H .W. Mallett, and Giles Kellogg. They formed the company on April 7, 1886,United States v.

The economy did not begin to recover until 1897, and after a multiple year slump the property market in southern California began to recover. As with his original switch from the navigation to railroad business, Hinde's move from railroads to hotels dramatically increased his personal fortune. From its founding until his death in 1915, Hinde remained vice president and treasurer of the Coronado Beach Company and the Spreckels Brothers Commercial Company.\\"Treasurer of Spreckels Company is Dead\\". The Evening News San Jose California, March 11, 1915. Later life and legacy Captain Hinde and President William Howard Taft at Hinde's Ranch in California At the age of 72, Hinde began to invest in property and mines in New Mexico as a hobby. Primarily, Hinde used his nephews, Harry Hinde and Frederick Hinde Zimmerman, to alert him to new business opportunities. The local newspapers reported on his investments, but he only experienced modest profits.\\"Personal,\\" Los Angeles Herald, April 29, 1905. Hinde bought the most expensive car on offer at the 1910 California Auto Show, a mammoth 72-horse power Thomas Flyer manufactured by the Thomas Motor Company. He tendered a check for $6,200 and drove the car back to one of his residences in San Diego, California.\\"Auto Show To Close Tonight,\\" Los Angeles Herald, February 26, 1910. Hinde was well connected among the elite businessmen and politicians of the time, owing to his extensive business interests. One of his closest friends was James J. Hill of the Pacific Railroad, with whom he became acquainted while working in the railroad business.Martin, Albro. \\"James J. Hill and the Opening of the Northwest,\\" Minnesota Historical Society Press, May 1, 1991. Hinde was politically neutral, but towards the end of his life he began to support Republican political candidates, at the urging of his nephew, Harry Hinde, a Republican politician.History of Riverside County, California: With Biographical Sketches of the Leading Men and Women of the County who have been Identified with its Growth and Development from the Early Days to the Present. (Google eBook), Elmer Wallace Holmes, Historic Record Company, 1912. During the 1912 presidential election, Hinde entertained President William Howard Taft, a Republican, at his home in Coronado; Taft was at the time campaigning for re- election for the presidency of the United States against Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson. Taft and his host went hunting and horse riding, and Hinde introduced Taft to many of his friends and business acquaintances.\\"Obituary of Captain Charles T. Hinde\\", Daily Republican Register. March 13, 1915. President Taft lost the election. Towards the end of his life, Hinde gave to many charities in southern California, and he was particularly generous to Coronado and San Diego.. He funded the construction of Christ Episcopal Church in Coronado, together with its parish center and rectory, all dedicated to his deceased daughter, Camilla. Even though Hinde was generous in his gifts, he remained modest and low-key throughout his life. He did not like receiving credit for his philanthropy, perhaps the reason his contributions were overlooked in the years following his death.McGrew, Clarence Alan. City of San Diego and San Diego County: The Birthplace of California, Volume 1. (Google eBook) American Historical Society, 1922. Hinde bequeathed a large part of his estate to his sister Belinda's son, Frederick Hinde Zimmerman, who used the money to build the Grand Rapids Hotel on the Hinde family farm in Mount Carmel. Hinde left an even larger portion of his estate and his house in Coronado to his nephew, Harry Hinde. Hinde died in Coronado on March 10, 1915, aged 82. In accordance with his wishes, the funeral service held in the Episcopal Church that he built for the residents of Coronado was modest. Hinde is buried in Mount Hope Cemetery, San Diego, California. His estate papers show that in addition to his other businesses, Hinde was a part-owner of the Los Angeles-based Global Grain & Milling Company, founded in 1898 and run by Will E.

Life Meissner was born in Bautzen. His father (died 1761) was a government quartermaster. From 1764 to 1772 he attended the school in L√∂bau and graduated in law at the University of Wittenberg on 18 September 1772. In 1774 he moved to the University of Leipzig, where he finished his studies in 1776. During his studies he developed a passion for the theater and poetry. At the urging of his mother he went to Dresden, where he joined the Federation of Free Masons. After a journey through Austria in 1785 he was offered the position of professor of aesthetics and classical literature at the University of Prague. In 1805 he went to Fulda to take up the position of director of the school, which he retained until his death. He died in Fulda, aged 53. Meissner's 1783 marriage to Johanna Becker produced several children. His daughter Bianca married, as her second husband, the German art historian and art patron Johann Gottlob von Quandt. The poet Alfred Meissner was his grandson. Literary work and importance Meissner's literary debut was in 1776 with the text of the comic opera Das Grab des Mufti oder die zwei Geizigen (The grave of the Mufti, or the two misers), which premiered in Leipzig on 17 January 1779. Meissner's significance for German literature is his role in developing the new genre of the detective story. There had been representations of crime in the form of sensational journalism and collections of legal cases, which were sometimes very popular, but Meissner's separation of legal and moral accountability of a crime made his tales of true crime the best-sellers of his time. Meissner shifted the focus of his stories from the criminal offense and its punishment to the psychological and social sources of the crime. The reader is acquainted with the offender before the criminal act occurs, they get to know the circumstances and motives of the crime and join the criminal in court. Meissner's narrative tradition was continued by Schiller, in his Crimes of Lost Honor, and in the works of Kleist. The detective story flowered in Germany in the 19th century. The genre is also known as Meissner's contribution to the Enlightenment, as his works caused a \\"humanization\\" of the law by incorporating social and psychological origins of crime. By 1800, psychological reports were accepted as relevant and were also cited in legal judgments. Meissner wrote many fables. One of the best known is Sonne und Wind (The Sun and the Wind) which is often mistakenly attributed to Johann Gottfried von Herder. He also undertook translations from English, such as Der Unsichtbare Kundschafter, a translation of Eliza Haywood's The Invisible Spy. Detective stories Meissner published more than 50 detective stories, which were very successful. The titles of some of these stories are: *\\"Mord aus Schw√§rmerey\\" *\\"Unkeusche, M√∂rderin, Mordbrennerin, und doch blos ein ungl√ºckliches M√§dchen\\" *\\"Blutsch√§nder, Feuerleger und M√∂rder zugleich, den Gesetzen nach, und doch ein J√ºngling von edler Seele\\" *\\"M√∂rder seiner Verlobten und R√§uber! dann eine Zeitlang redlicher Mann; seltsam entdeckt, noch seltsamer sich selbst angebend\\"  References  * August Gottlieb Mei√üner: Ausgew√§hlte Kriminalgeschichten.

It was released in North America on the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network on December 11, 2012 and on Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade on December 12, 2012. Gameplay Black Knight Sword features a unique Kamishibai art style. Black Knight Sword plays is a side- scrolling action game. Players control a character who takes on the identity of the Black Knight and his sword on their quest to defeat the White Princess. The game features a theater styled backdrop whereupon the character remains static as the backdrops change place to give the player a feeling of movement. The player is armed with a magical sword used to dispatch foes, and the game also features elements of platforming. Hearts can be collected from fallen enemies, which in turn can be used in various in-game shops to purchase equipment and upgrades. Plot The game begins with a narrator stating \\"The wormwood sways back and forth, embracing the wind\\", as stage curtains open to reveal the set of a play, and the player character, Grahame Wormwood, having committed suicide by hanging himself in an empty bedroom. He sways back and forth to free himself from the noose around his neck, and what lies in front of him on the floor is a black suit of armor impaled with a sword, and a small, doll-like female character, known as Black Hellebore hovering above it. Black Hellebore then seems to inhabit the sword by phasing inside of it, and Grahame pulls the sword from the suit of armor. The black suit of armor then binds itself to Wormwood, as the play continues with Wormwood (now as the Black Knight), with the help of Black Hellebore, progressing through stage sets filled with hostile creatures, whom are often disembodied heads, other grotesque monstrosities, and wild animals. The stage play is separated into and presented in 5 acts, with each act prefacing itself with fairy tale-like scenarios involving animals and their deaths. The animals in these stories serve as each act's finale. For example, one tale tells of a spider that saved a princess from entrapment, only to have been killed by her unassuming father upon her return. This spider then serves as the act's finale, with the Black Knight engaging it in battle. The narrator often tells the audience to \\"beware\\" before these encounters occur, and applauds the Black Knight when he defeats these creatures. This theme of Wormwood having to make his way past animals with seemingly unfortunate pasts continues until the play reaches its final act, which is prefaced with a story about two constantly bickering sisters. The story states that God disapproved of their arguing so much that He trapped the two inside of their own fairy tale, where they could bicker for the rest of eternity. As the Black Knight makes his way to act 5's finale, the narrator (seemingly addressing the Black Knight himself) starts to question if he even remembers all the ones he's killed and loved. As color progressively fades from the set, the narrator continues to state that if they are forgotten, then there is \\"nothing left.\\" The Black Knight then finds himself standing in front of the hanged Grahame Wormwood, whom he cuts from his noose with his sword. The room then fills with white flowers as a White Princess appears. The Black Knight taunts the Princess and engages her in battle. The White Princess appears ethereal as she floats around, telepathically chucking disembodied heads at the Black Knight and growing to an inhuman size. She then begins throwing eggs at the Black Knight which hatch into the disembodied heads and grotesque creatures he's already been facing throughout the play, where it's revealed that the White Princess was in control of these creatures all along. After The Black Knight defeats the White Princess (with invaluable help from Black Hellebore), her body dissipates and leaves a white suit of armor and white sword behind, as a small, white, doll-like character emerges; White Hellebore. Black Hellebore and White Hellebore are the two sisters mentioned in the prefacing tale, and true to the story, they start fighting each other as the Black Knight watches on. White Hellebore then animates the white suit of armor, and the White Knight appears and begins to attack the Black Knight. The game concludes with a battle between the Black Knight and the White Knight on a stage set that's looking down at the Earth. After the White Knight and White Hellebore are defeated, the Black Knight and Black Hellebore then return to the initial bedroom set of the play, passing all of the previous sets along the way. Before entering the room, Black Hellebore removes herself from the sword the Black Knight is holding and flies away, as the sword and the armor dissipate completely, with Wormwood freed from the armor's binding. Wormwood then enters the bedroom and once again hangs himself. The narrator then reiterates the line \\"The Wormwood sways back and forth, embracing the wind,\\" and adds \\"one day, the fields themselves will wither and fade. The wormwood forgotten by all,\\" as the stage curtains close and the play comes to an end. Development Black Knight Sword was announced on August 17, 2011 at Gamescom. It was developed jointly by Grasshopper Manufacture and Digital Reality. The game is one of two collaborations between the two teams, the other being Sine Mora, with Digital Reality publishing the game. In response to an interviewer's question regarding the collaboration, Director of Publishing Bal√°zs Horv√°th simply stated that the two teams \\"both know what makes a good game.\\" A preview version was playable at Penny Arcade Expo (PAX) Prime 2011. It was also shown with a playable demo at PAX East 2012 in Boston, Massachusetts. Digital Reality has described the game as \\"Monty Python meets Czech animation meets Japanese paper theater.\\" Composer Akira Yamaoka called the game \\"a throwback to the old-school classic side-scrolling action games.\\" During early previews the game drew comparisons from critics to the Mega Man, Strider and Castlevania series. Reception Black Knight Sword received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Critics praised the game's art style, with Eurogamer stating, \\"Its richest ideas are to be found in the presentation, the aesthetic, the art direction and stage direction.\\" Reviewers often criticized its gameplay, however. While Meristation praised the gameplay, stating, \\"Black Knight Sword is a good return to the roots of the 16-bit action games, well crafted, with an amazing design\\", other reviewers cited the game's difficulty as a point of contention. Joystiq wrote, \\"Yes, [the PSN version's] Normal mode itself is tremendously hard, but not in such a way as to make the struggle seem worth it, or even remotely do-able.\\" Notes References External links * Category:2012 video games Category:Dark fantasy video games Category:Grasshopper Manufacture games Category:Hack and slash games Category:Metroidvania games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Side-scrolling video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Unreal Engine games Category:Video games developed in Hungary Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Video games scored by Akira Yamaoka Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox 360 Live Arcade games ","title":"Black Knight Sword"},{"id":"34391295","text":"Mariam () was a daughter of King Bagrat IV of Georgia (r. 1027‚Äì1072) by his Alan wife Borena.

Rome a student of the medieval Caucasian genealogies, identifies Mariam with the anonymous \\"Alan\\" woman of \\"very good birth\\" known from Anna Komnene's Alexiad to have married, as his second wife, the Byzantine nobleman Theodore Gabras, dux of Trebizond in 1091. This lady was a cousin of Eirene, another bride from Georgia at the Byzantine court, who was married to the sebastokrator Isaac Komnenos, brother of the emperor Alexios I Komnenos. Eirene was mother of the fianc√©e of Gregory Gabras, Theodore's son of his first marriage. Thus, Gregory's engagement with a Komnenid princess was quietly broken off as they were now considered close relatives and according to civil and the ecclesiastical laws, such marriages were forbidden. Alexios, however, was worried about Theodore's reaction, so he kept Gregory at the court as a hostage in order to ensure Theodore's continued good behavior, reassuring Theodore with the claim that he was contemplating marrying Gregory to one of his own daughters.

It is defined as a hostile attitude towards sentient beings, towards frustration, and towards that which gives rise to one's frustrations; it functions as a basis for faultfinding, for negative actions, and for not finding a moment of peace or happiness.Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 728-729.Kunsang (2004), p. 25. Pratigha is identified as: * One of the six root unwholesome mental factors within the Mahayana Abhidharma tradition * One of the ten fetters in the Theravada tradition (according to the Dhammasangani) Definitions Theravada Patigha (Pali) is defined by Theravada sources as: anger, repulsion, collision;A.P.

It is one of the proclivities (anusaya, q.v.). # '(Sense-) reaction'. Applied to five-sense cognition, p. occurs in the following contexts: ::(a) as pa·π≠igha-sa√±√±ƒÅ, 'perception of sense-reaction', said to be absent in the immaterial absorptions (s. jhƒÅna 5). Alternative renderings: resistance-perception, reflex-perception; ::(b) as pa·π≠igha-samphassa, '(mental) impression caused by 5fold sensorial reaction' (D. 15); s. phassa; ::(c) as Sappa·π≠igha-r≈´pa, 'reacting corporeality', and appa·π≠igha, 'not reacting', which is an Abhidhammic classification of corporeality, occurring in Dhs. 659, 1050. Sappa·π≠igha are called the physical sense-organs as reacting (or responding) to sense stimuli; and also the physical sense-objects as impinging (or making an impact) on the sense-organs. All other corporeality is appa·π≠igha, non-reacting and non-impinging. These 2 terms have been variously rendered as resistant and not, responding and not, with and without impact. Mahayana The Abhidharma-samuccaya states: :What is pratigha? It is ill- will with regard to living beings, with regard to suffering and with regard to things pertaining to suffering. Its function is to produce a basis for unhappy states and bad conduct.Walpola Rahula (2007), Kindle Locations 757-759. Alexander Berzin states that pratigha is aimed at \\"another limited being, one's own suffering, or situations entailing suffering\\". This involves being impatient with the objects of the pratigha (anger), and wishing to get rid of them, for example, by striking out against them and harming them. It is based on regarding the object as unattractive or repulsive by its very nature.Berzin Archives glossary entry for \\"anger\\" Berzin identifies dvesha (aversion) as a subcategory of pratigha (anger) that is directed primarily, although not exclusively, at limited beings.Berzin (2006) Alternate translations * Anger (Herbert Guenther, Alexander Berzin) * Repugnance (Walpola Rahula) * Resistance (Thanissaro Bhikkhu) * Harshness (Bhikkhu Sujato) See also * Dvesha * Kleshas (Buddhism) * Mental factors (Buddhism) * Three poisons References Sources * Berzin, Alexander (2006), Primary Minds and the 51 Mental Factors * Ch√∂gyam Trungpa (2009).

Format: Paperback, 294pp. Language: English. Born in Regina, Saskatchewan, Mildred Warwick was one of the 57 players born in Canada to join the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in its twelve years history. She was one of the most feared hitters in the early years of the circuit, setting an all-time hitting streak record during her very short career. The first AAGPBL spring training was set for May 17, 1943, at Wrigley Field in Chicago. Philip K. Wrigley, founder of the league, had scouts all over the United States and Canada signing girls for tryouts. About 500 of them attended the call. Of these, only 280 were invited to the final try-outs in Chicago where 60 were chosen to become the first women to ever play professional baseball. The league started with four teams, the Kenosha Comets, the Racine Belles, the Rockford Peaches and the South Bend Blue Sox. Each team was made up of fifteen girls. Warwick survived the final cut and was assigned to the Rockford team, where she played in just two seasons.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League: A Biographical Dictionary ‚Äì W.

All-American Girls Professional Baseball League History Warwick grew up in Regina along with five brothers, including a twin. Brothers Grant and Bill played hockey at the time. At an early age she played softball with her brothers in a big field next her home. She began playing softball in school at age 12. She played for the Regina Army Navy Bombers team when she was 20, when a scout of the league saw her hitting and fielding abilities and invited her to Wrigley Field.The Women of the All- American Girls Professional Baseball League She started at third base for the Peaches, managed by Eddie Stumpf, as a part of a well assembled infield that included Dorothy Kamenshek (1B), Mildred Deegan (2B) and her fellow Gladys Davis (SS).1943 Rockford Peaches From June 20 to 27, 1943, Warwick hit safely in 13 consecutive games to set an all-time league record that stood until Kenosha Comets' Elizabeth Mahon tied it two years later. She batted a .263 average in 88 games, a pretty good performance considering her teammate Davis was the only to reach the .300 mark in the inaugural season (.332). Warwick also scored 62 runs and drove in 30 more, ranking eight in hits (93) and ninth in total bases (115), while tying for seventh in triples (7) and runs. She also established another league record with 10 assists at third base in a single game.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book For the first three seasons the league did not have an official All-Star team. Nevertheless, on July 1, 1943 took effect the first AAGPBL All-Star Game, which coincidentally became the first night game ever played at Wrigley Field. The contest was played under temporary lights between two teams composed of Kenosha and Racine players against Rockford and South Bend players.ESPN Page 2 ‚Äì Reel Life: A League of Their Own - Article by Jeff Merron Warwick played another season in 1944. Then, in 1945 she married hockey player Ken McAuley, a goaltender for the NHL New York Rangers, and decided to settle down with her husband in Edmonton, Alberta. She continued to play fastpitch softball in an Edmonton team, who clinched the Canadian title in 1951. She also worked for the Department of Energy during 27 years, retiring in 1988. She widowed in 1992. After retiring, she attended AAGPBL Players Association reunions. The association was largely responsible for the opening of Women in Baseball, a permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled in 1988 to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Besides this, in 1986 she was inducted into the Sackatchewan Hall of Fame and Museum along with her brothers Claude, a professional boxer, and Grant, Richard and William Warwick, all of them professional hockey players.

Biography Tate was born Gerry Hurtado in Los Angeles, California to his father Jorge, a local machine shop foreman, and his mother Hilda, a clerk at the nearby Knott's Berry Farm. Tate was a top amateur skater in the early 1970s, but in a 1987 People Magazine interview, he downplayed his ability by saying he \\"only skated for fun\\". Tate later attended a broadcasting trade school, and applied his trade by working as a DJ in punk rock clubs. From his time in the clubs, Tate took up more interest in the newly growing skate rock movement, and recorded his first song, \\"Skaterock Rap\\", in his friend's basement in 1983. Upon its release, it became popular with skaters and Tate came to emcee parties and skate contests in both Los Angeles and New York.ThrasherMagazine.com: Gerry Hurtado announcing a contest, November 1982 In the mid-80s, Tate was touring as an opening act for the all-girl thrash band Screaming Sirens, and his music was showing up in skate videos. He released his first album, A Way Of Lif, in 1988, and the song \\"La Cumbre\\" appeared on the Powell Peralta video Public Domain during a scene where the team tours Mexico. Tate originally wrote the song as a tribute to a local skater hangout. Tate later became the Host of SK8-TV, a half-hour television show on Nickelodeon, with co-host Matthew Lynn. The show only lasted one season and was pulled after 13 episodes. Since his departure from SK8-TV, Tate has also recorded with such acts as Porno For Pyros and was a producer for the acid jazz group The Stone Boners. His song \\"Jolt\\" was later featured in the 1991 comedy What About Bob? On October 13, 2015, Hurtado died of liver cancer at the age of 56.

Overview The issue of recognition is usually predicated upon two pre-existing or debated criteria: # that same-sex unions are recognized or conferred legitimacy in the country or at some subdivision level of a nation's government # and that homosexuals and bisexuals can openly serve in the military without being punitively removed from service on the basis of their sexual orientation or conduct. If both criteria are fulfilled, the question becomes a matter of how many rights, liberties or benefits are conferred by a military upon same-sex spouses of military servicemembers. Such stipulations include: * Military housing provisions * Military base security access clearance * Insurance benefits * Pensions * Hospital visitation * Inheritance and intestacy * Custody or adoption of dependents * Taxes * Educational benefits * Employment benefits * Attendance of military social events * Spousal registration and identification * Retirement benefits for both spouses, even after a post-retirement divorce Adoption and parenting No data currently exist on adoption of children or parenting by same-sex military families. In countries which legally recognize at least same-sex unregistered cohabitation, same-sex adoption and open service in the military, the allowance of same-sex adoption by such countries' armed forces is more likely assured. In addition to the issues and occurrences which are encountered in general LGBT parenting, children in same-sex military families would also encounter issues which are endemic to children of opposite-sex military couples, such as deployment, frequent household reassignment, life among other military children (i.e., in school, playtime, socialization), care for wounded parents, life after the death of a parent, dependent benefits, and so on. By country Africa South Africa In 2002 the South African National Defence Force extended medical and pension benefits, which had previously only been available to the spouses of military personnel, to their life partners without regard to gender. This came about as a consequence of the Constitutional Court's ruling in Satchwell v President of the Republic of South Africa; although that case involved the same-sex partner of a High Court judge, the reasoning was applicable to all government employees. Same-sex marriages have been possible since 2006 and are legally equivalent to opposite-sex marriages. Americas Brazil The Brazilian Armed Forces recognize same-sex cohabitation unions and marriages and treats same-sex couples with military spouses as legally equivalent to different-sex couples. Married couples, though, may have more rights than those in \\"stable unions\\" or cohabitation. Canada The Canadian Armed Forces recognize same-sex marriages and treats same-sex couples with military spouses as legally equivalent to opposite-sex couples. United States On 14 August 2013, the Department of Defense (DoD) announced that it would provide spousal and family benefits to servicemembers in same-sex marriages on the same terms as it does to those in different-sex marriages. The benefits, which include health care coverage, housing allowances, military ID cards, and survivor benefits, can be claimed retroactive to 26 June, the day of the Supreme Court decision in United States v. Windsor that held the statute under which the U.S. military was withholding those benefits, Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, unconstitutional. A same-sex marriage must be documented by a marriage certificate that establishes that the marriage was valid where it was celebrated. The DoD also announced that servicemembers who need to travel to a jurisdiction that allows them to marry will be afforded 7 days leave to do so, 10 days if they are stationed outside the U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said: \\"This will provide accelerated access to the full range of benefits offered to married military couples throughout the department, and help level the playing field between opposite-sex and same-sex couples seeking to be married\\". The DoD set 3 September as its target date for implementation. On 13 September 2013, VA home loan benefits were extended to include same sex marriages. Europe France Until 2013, civil solidarity pacts (PACS) were allowed to all same-sex and opposite-sex couples, but did not possess several rights which are made available to same-sex unions outside France, such as marriages in Belgium or civil partnerships in the United Kingdom. PACS are recognized by the French Armed Forces, but consequently confer fewer abilities or benefits to (same-sex or opposite-sex) couples than marriages. Legislation passed by Parliament on 13 January 2011 granted military partners living under PACS equal access to pensions as those given to married opposite-sex couples. In France, same-sex couples are allowed to wed (as of 2013), and are eligible to full military family benefits under French law. Ireland The Irish Defence Forces allow for married servicemembers to record their partnership status on their personnel file. Portugal Portugal allows all citizens to serve openly in the military regardless of sexual orientation, as the constitution explicitly forbids any discrimination on that basis, therefore openly allowing lesbians and gays to serve in the military. Their partners, married or not, are eligible for all benefits as is the case with other civil servants. United Kingdom Since December 2005, spouses in civil partnerships are entitled to spousal benefits (including life insurance benefits, pensions, employment benefits), immigration equality, and similar recognition as opposite-sex military spouses for tax purposes. Civil partners are also allowed accommodation in military housing, security clearance and allowances. Since March 2014, UK military same-sex couples can get married (as well as UK civilians), under the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013. This law does not apply to Northern Ireland where it is the only part of the UK where same sex marriage is not legal. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has blocked gay marriage five times. Oceania Australia On 9 December 2017 same-sex marriage was officially legalized throughout Australia. From 1 July 2009 couples of any sex have de facto the same legal rights and benefits as married couples. The Australian Defence Force policies on couples of any sex follow a directive from the Minister of Defense of 1 January 2010 that enforces the terms of the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws‚ÄîSuperannuation) Act 2008. New Zealand Same-sex civil unions became legal in 2005 and marriage became law in New Zealand in 2013. References Further reading * Frank, Nathaniel, ed.

Their work included the Haymills Estate in Hanger Hill. In 1935 Cachemaille-Day began an independent practice. Shortly afterwards he designed the Church of St Michael and All Angels, Northenden (1936‚Äì37), which well illustrates his absorption of \\"Continental experiments.\\" Pevsner described it as \\"a sensational church for its country and its day.\\" From the 1930s he became known for his churches, some of which are the most innovative ecclesiastical buildings of their time. He was one of the leading English architects to embrace the Liturgical Movement. Between 1931 and 1963 he designed at least 61 churches, many of which are now listed buildings. His churches include St Alban's Church, Southampton and the Church of St Nicholas, Burnage. The interior of St Barnabas, in Stroud Road, Gloucester, built at the foot of the Cotswolds in an estate south of the city, distills Gothic architecture into pure, simple gestures of interchanging arches within a huge hall church: the energy and dance of the Gothic is at the heart of this design, setting up a majestic yet lively space, its scale suggesting the ambition of a cathedral builder.

It is a coastal species from south-east Asia which has been recorded in Papua New Guinea. Description The Indian threadfin is a large species with an elongated head and body. Its eye is roughly the same size as the length of its snout. The joint of the jaws is to the rear of the eyelid. It has two separated dorsal fins, the first dorsal fin contains 8 spines while the second dorsal fin has a single spine and 12 or 13 soft rays. The anal fin has 3 spines and 10 or 11 soft rays. The base of the anal-fin is shorter than that of the second dorsal-fin. The pectoral fin has 12 to 14rays and has a length equivalent to 19 to 22% of the standard length, its tip not reaching to the tip of the pelvic fin. The pectoral fin is situated well below the body's midline. There are five pectoral filaments, the first one being the shortest and does not extend to the pelvic fin while the fifth filament is the longest with a length equivalent 28 to 45% of standard length and extending well beyond the posterior tip of the pelvic fin. The caudal fin is deeply forked with the upper and lower lobes being extremely long and filamentous. It has 69 to 72 pored scales in its simple lateral line which extends from the upper end of gill opening to upper end of lower lobe of the caudal-fin lobe. The head and upper flanks are tinted slightly blackish brown, darkening on the lower flanks. The snout and abdomen are blackish. The membranes of first and second dorsal fins and caudal fin are blackish with their outer portions being black. The membrane of the pectoral fin is deep black with the base of the filaments being dusky yellow, darkening to the rear. The pelvic fin is also dusky yellow at its base and dirty white on its other parts. This species can attain a length of but most specimens will be around . Distribution The Indian threadfin has been confirmed as occurring in the coastal waters of southern Asia from Pakistan to Borneo. In Papua New Guinea there is a single record of a specimen taken in Kerema Bay in the Gulf of Papua. Records from Africa are unconfirmed and not now regarded to be of this species. Habitat and ecology The Indian threadfin is found over shallow muddy and sandy substrates on the continental shelf, especially in the vicinity of estuaries and it is known to enter rivers. It is carnivorous and the largest part of its diet is small benthic crustaceans, such as prawns and crabs, and small fishes. The amount of fishes taken increases as the fishes grow larger. It has been taken from as deep as but rarely below . In a sample taken off India 40% of the fish caught were hermaphrodites, 19.3% were males and 41% were females. They spawn in two main periods, April to June and October to November, with the main breeding season being April to June. However, in southern India spawning was in October and November. Fisheries The Indian threadfin is one of the most important quarries for fisheries of a number of Asian nations< They are caught with gill nets, trawls, handlines and beach seines. The flesh is used fresh or preserved by freezing, drying and smoking and is prepared by baking, steaming, frying or broiling. Species description and taxonomy This species was first formally described by as Polynemus indicum in 1804 by the irish naturalist George Shaw from a drawing by Russell and he gave the location of the type as Vizagapatam.

The site is located at the head of Mackenzie Bay, in the area of the isthmus of Hold with Hope. Administratively it belongs to the Northeast Greenland National Park. History The station was established by Johan A. Olsen in 1922, who named the place appropriately, for it is located in one of the worst mosquito- infested areas of Eastern Greenland (). However, on the way back to Norway in 1923, the Norwegian sealer ANNI 1 which had brought the expedition to Greenland in 1922 was crushed in the offshore pack ice and all men on board perished. Thus the station was discontinued after only one year of operation. In 1924 Myggbukta station was repaired by Gunnar Isachsen and it was manned by the Foldvik expedition in 1926. In 1930 was completely rebuilt and operation was continuous, sending daily weather reports from the site. On 27 June 1931 five Norwegian hunters with Hallvard Devold annexed Erik the Red's Land to Norway from the station, proclaiming: Myggbukta thus served as de facto capital of this short-lived Norwegian territory, although sysselman (\\"Governor\\") Helge Ingstad overwintered at the more southerly station Antarctic Havn.

The park was formed after the damming of Distress Creek to create a recreational lake in the county in 1960. The park is located along the western bank of the lake and is open for year- round for camping/picnicking. Boat rentals are available from February to November. History Entering Lake Poinsett State Park Activists in Harrisburg and elsewhere in Poinsett County began efforts to obtain a recreational lake in their area in the 1950s, but their efforts were not successful due to a lack of funds. The idea was adopted by the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, who made plans to dam Distress Creek as funds became available, but the money would not come through until former Arkansas highway commissioner Dan Portis discussed the plan with Arkansas governor Orval Faubus. The dam became a reality in 1960, and was named for Poinsett County. The idea for a state park came from locals Richard Woods and L. K. Collier, who donated of land toward a park. Locals raised enough money to double the donation of land to the Arkansas State Parks, Recreation and Travel Commission, who deemed the land big enough for a park and accepted the donation on June 21, 1963, making Lake Poinsett State Park the 20th state park in Arkansas. Recreation Beginning of the Great Blue Heron biking trail in the park Fishers will find bass, bream, catfish, and crappie in the lake's shallow waters. The park offers 29 campsites (4 class A, 22 Class B, and 3 tent sites), but does not contain any other types of cabin or lodging. A pavilion with restrooms is available near the campsites. Park interpreters guide visitors along trail walks in addition to wildlife and birding tours. Kayaking and canoe tours on the lake are also guided by park interpreters seasonally. The Great Blue Heron Trail is a hiking trail that beginning near the children's playground and winds in a loop through the woods. Picnic tables are scattered throughout the park in open areas. Four other state parks accompany Lake Poinsett State Park atop Crowley's Ridge: Crowley's Ridge State Park, Lake Frierson State Park, Parkin Archeological State Park, and Village Creek State Park are all nearby.

It is the location of the first performance of the hymn \\"The Old Rugged Cross.\\" The church was listed as a Michigan State Historic Site in 2000 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. History Methodist circuit-riders began holding religious services in Pokagon Township in the 1830s. In 1840, a class was organized in Sumnerville. Eventually, the First Methodist Episcopal Church of Pokagon was organized. In approximately 1862, this building was constructed as a hop barn. In 1876, the First Methodist Episcopal Church of Pokagon purchased the building and enlarged and remodeled it into a church. A belfry (now gone) was added, as were pointed-head windows, stained glass, and interior pews. In 1913, the church's pastor Rev. Leroy Bostwick invited his friend. the Rev. George Bennard, to Pokagon to assist in a series of revival meetings at the church. At the meeting, the church choir performed Bennard's newly penned hymn, \\"The Old Rugged Cross;\\" it was the first time the hymn was performed in public. Afterward, the Reverend and Mrs. Bostwick financed the first printing of the \\"Old Rugged Cross,\\" and it quickly became one of the most popular hymns in the United States. In 1914, the congregation purchased the nearby Baptist church, selling this church to John Phillips, who used it as a storage barn. In 1998, the church was purchased for restoration. As of 2013, the restoration was 85% complete, with over $800,000 spent. In 2013 the church received a Governor's Award for Historic Preservation. Description The First Methodist Episcopal Church of Pokagon is a rectangular, two-story vernacular building measuring by . It has a gable roof and horizontal bevel-edge siding.

It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1979 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. The chapel is the oldest known church building in Cass County, and probably the oldest in southwest Michigan. History Cannon Smith, the son of George and Sophia Cannon Smith, was born in 1782. He settled in this location in 1829 after moving from his previous home in Delaware. In 1831, traveling Methodist circuit preachers established classes at Smith's home. This led to the organization of the first Methodist church in Milton Township in 1839. In 1840, the congregation hired James Taylor, a carpenter and joiner, to construct this church building at a cost of $1200. Cannon Smith donated the land, and contributed substantially toward the construction of the church. Because of these contributions, the church was named \\"Smith's Chapel\\". The surrounding cemetery grounds were purchased in 1872. In 1879, contractor W. S. Beswick was hired to remodel the church. The church was used regularly until 1967, and in 1972 Milton Township purchased the structure. In 2008, the chapel underwent substantial restoration. In 2013, the township owned the chapel, with the surrounding cemetery grounds owned by a non-profit organization, Smith Chapel Cemetery Inc. The building was available for rental as a wedding and funeral chapel. In November 2018 the township sold the chapel and grounds to private citizens, who subsequently made restorations. Description Smith's Chapel is a single-story wood frame post-and-beam chapel with clapboard siding and a gable roof on a fieldstone foundation. It measures , with a hallway wide across the front, and a sanctuary. A gabled entrance is on one end with an oculus above. The sides contain round-arch windows with wooden hood molds. Attached to rear of the chapel is a gable-roof, clapboard-sided privy. Cemetery grounds are located near the chapel, containing primarily stone (and one zinc) monuments.

On a half-deck bridge, the deck is attached in the center rather than, as is more common, top or bottom of the superstructure. It crosses the Dearborn River on Lake Bean Road (Montana Secondary 435) about southwest of Augusta, Montana. The unusual design of the Dearborn River High Bridge suits it to carry light loads across high/deep crossings. It has four spans and a wooden plank deck. It is the last standing pin-connected Pratt half-deck truss bridge left in the United States. Construction cost was $9,997. Construction began in 1896 and completed in 1897. This crossing point on the Dearborn River had been used for many years by the local Indian tribes, primarily the Blackfeet. Prior to the bridge's construction this location was known as the Ponderay Crossing. The river was named for United States Secretary of War Henry Dearborn by Lewis and Clark in 1805. The area was left largely unexplored by Europeans for the next 50 years or so. The bridge was rehabilitated in 2003 by the Montana Department of Transportation, with Sletten Construction of Great Falls, Montana as the lead contractor, and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 18, 2003.

It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. History Clare Congregational Church, 1909 The village of Clare was established in 1870‚àí71. The Rev. Austin H. Norris arrived in 1872, and organized the Clare Congregational Church. The congregation first met in a school house, but in 1873 work was begun on a small frame church, which was completed in 1874. In 1907, the congregation determined that a new church building was required. The original church was moved to the rear of the lot, and in 1908 the church commissioned Saginaw architect William T. Cooper to design the new building. Construction was completed in 1909. In 1961, the Clare Congregational Church merged with the United Church of Christ, and the combined congregation was known as the Clare Congregational United Church of Christ. The building was extensively renovated in 1994, and is still used by the congregation. Description The Clare Congregational Church is a red brick building with limestone trim on a concrete foundation, built in a cross-shape with an octagonal dome. Each of the four facades features a limestone beltcourse above the high basement, and broad central area containing three windows flanked by shallow piers with limestone trim. The main entrance to the church is a small hip roof structure located at one corner. The central dome is pierced by stained glass windows. Stained glass in the remainder of the church was originally installed in the earlier 1874 building. A single-story addition was constructed at the rear of the church in 1958. The interior consists of a semi-circular sanctuary, decorated with patterns from European-designed stencils. The church is significant as one of the few in Michigan that reflect the architectural adoption by early twentieth-century Protestants of the Early Christian central plan churches of the 5th and 6th centuries.

It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. It is one of the first church buildings constructed in Michigan west of Detroit, and is one of the few surviving examples of indigenous church architecture in the state. History In 1833, the Episcopal missionary William N. Lyster left Ireland for the United States, and eventually became the restor of a mission in Tecumseh, Michigan. From there, he traveled throughout southern Michigan to minister to isolated communities; in 1836 he held the first church service in Jonesville. Two years later, a parish was organized by Darius Barker. In 1844, the congregation began constructing this church; it was completed on November 15, 1848, at a cost of $3,000. In 1946, an old schoolhouse was moved to the site of the church to serve as a parish hall. The church was deconsecrated and sold in 2007, and currently houses a coffee house. Description Grace Episcopal Church is a 1-1/2 story rectangular Greek Revival frame structure covered in clapboard. The building has a single-story projecting entry vestibule, atop which is a square tower which intersects with the main structure. Square pilasters run up each corner of the building, and both the entry projection and the main structure are topped with a gable roof. Gothic double-arched lancet windows line the sides of the building, providing the building with a somewhat rare mix of Greek Revival and Gothic styles. Similar single-arched windows are on each side of the entry vestibule. Black walnut paneling lined the interior, and the pews are constructed of the same wood. A small altar, also of black walnut, is set amongst frescoes.

It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1979 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. History The area around Sherman City was first settled in 1866. In 1869, a small log store was erected in what is now Sherman City, and the settlement itself was platted in 1870. John T. Cahoon built the first of several sawmills in the area in 1879, and the population boomed as the increase in local lumber trade increased. A tornado in 1878 destroyed much of the town, but by the next year it had been substantially rebuilt. The Sherman City Union Church was built in 1885 by William L. Shupe as a meeting hall for the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) Post 77. In 1898, the building was moved to the present site, and renovations began to outfit it as a nondenominational church. By 1904, renovations were complete, and the building was in service for regular services by multiple denominations. The church was also used for holiday services, weddings and funerals, and nonreligious social activities such as quilting bees and ice cream socials. However, lumbering declined in the early 1900s, and the town began declining along with it. Other commercial and social structures in the town were torn down one by one. The church itself was in use sporadically until at least 1956, but was finally abandoned in about 1960. The church and a scattering of houses are all that remain of Sherman City. However, in 1977-78 the church was rescued and refurbished by local citizens. The cedar roof was reshingled, new windows were installed, and new clapboard siding was attached. The belfry was reconstructed, and the interior cleaned and pews replaced. Description The Sherman City Union Church is a 1-1/2 story frame structure covered with clapboard. A two-story tower, located in the center of the front facade, has a pyramidal belfry with open sides. The entrance is at the base of the tower, through a set of double doors below a transom.

The topic of ghosts and spirits (kehua) in MƒÅori culture is often considered a tapu subject, yet many MƒÅori legends contain mentions of apparitions and paranormal occurrences. It is claimed that long deceased family members may appear to warn of upcoming danger, such as with the famous phantom canoe in 1886 that many reportedly saw on Lake Tarawera, that is believed to have been an omen for the volcanic eruption that occurred eleven days later.

Taniwha are guardian monsters that reside in bodies of water such as rivers or lakes and can appear as sharks, whales, dragons or even floating logs.  Death  Following a death, MƒÅori custom requires the body of the dead be returned to its whƒÅnau (family) as soon as possible. The whƒÅnau is then called onto a marae for a tangihanga (funeral) to remove sadness and clear the spirits. The ghosts and spirits are called to join those who are already living in the afterlife. It is believed that if certain rituals are not conducted, the whƒÅnau of a dead person are likely to face stress and unhappiness and if the spirits are not satisfied, they may choose to take someone else. Sometimes, when a person was nearing death, beyond hope of further living, a procedure known as tuku wairua was traditionally performed by a tohunga priest, which helped the spirit leave the body so it would not become restless and wander. In modern times, a relative familiar with the procedure may perform the tuku wairua; however priests or ministers, generally Christian, may still be called to give the dying person a blessing. Many MƒÅori people believe that the spirits of the dead watch over the living. For this reason, MƒÅori families will hold unveiling services and blessings of gravestones of those who have been gone for a year or longer as a way of remembering and paying respects to those who have died.

History Known locally as ‚Äúthe church with the red doors,‚Äù St. John‚Äôs was initially established as a mission church in 1876 by circuit riders. The church‚Äôs cornerstone was laid in 1882. All the building materials for the church were donated by local businessman William N. Brown, with the bricks made at his own yard, lumber from his sawmill, and the excavation and finishing work completed by his employees.

Building description St. John's Episcopal Church is a single story, white-painted brick building with a steep gable roof, measuring 92 feet by 32 feet. The shed-roofed front entryway projects from the facade of the church, and is reached via a staircase. The interior is reached through a pair of entry doors with sharp upper points. The two sides of the church contain English Gothic recessed stained glass windows spaced at regular intervals. The church interior was modeled on the Riding House at Bolsover Castle in Bolsover, England. The floor is wood and tongue- in-groove wainscoting lines the walls. The vaulted ceiling has heavy wood beams. All liturgical appointments, including the pulpit, lectern, altar, and altar rail, are made of maple.

It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.Historic markers standing next to the church (state) and affixed to the front of the church (national). Women‚Äôs Guild The Women‚Äôs Guild at St. John‚Äôs, originally called the Ladies‚Äô Guild, existed from 1886 to 1974. The Women‚Äôs Guild was largely responsible for keeping the church going during rough times and paying the bills. Notable priests The Rev. John H. Rippey, M.D., served as acting rector of several churches on a circuit, including St. John‚Äôs, from 1887 through 1910. His work at the church, and the lives of parishioners are documented in a journal and parish registry book, 1887-1911, and three scrapbooks, 1874-1935, and undated, as well as in two handwritten services from July 1908. Rev. John H. Goodrow served as rector at St. John‚Äôs from 1962 until his sudden death in 1985. Rev. Goodrow was very aware of those in need in the community and privately assisted many through the help of wealthier friends in the local oil community. During his tenure, he strongly supported \\"Food with Friends,\\" a Commission on Aging program that provided nightly meals in the parish hall for community members. He was also responsible for many other community outreach initiatives, including the St. John‚Äôs Emergency Food Program.St. John‚Äôs Episcopal Church website, http://www.stjohnsmtpleasantmi.org (accessed May 5, 2012) The Goodrow Fund at St. John‚Äôs was established and named in his honor (in 1986?).

It took place on January 12, 2012, at Arena Naucalpan in Naucalpan, State of Mexico. The 2012 El Protector was the first event produced under that name, but was a continuation of the Proyeccion a Nuevas Promesas (\\"Projecting a new promise\\") tournament of 2010 and 2011 . The focal point of the show was the El Protector tag team tournament where eight teams competed for the trophy. Production Background Lucha Libre has a tradition for a tournament where a rookie, or novato, would be teamed up with an experienced veteran wrestler for a tag team tournament in the hopes of giving the Novato a chance to show case their talent and move up the ranks. Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre has held a Torneo Gran Alternativa (\\"Great Alternative Tournament\\") almost every year since 1994, but the concept predates the creation of the Gran Alternativa. The Mexican professional wrestling company International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; at times referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Mexico) started their own annual rookie/veteran tournament in 2010. The first two tournaments were called Torneo Relampago de Proyeccion a Nuevas Promesas de la Lucha Libre (Spanish for \\"Projecting a new promise lightning tournament\\") but would be renamed the El Protector tournament in 2012. The El Protector shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general, are held in \\"Arena Naucalpan\\", owned by the promoters of IWRG and their main arena. The 2012 El Protector show was the third time that IWRG promoted a show around the rookie/veteran tournament, with the name changing to El Protector from this year and onwards. Storylines The event featured nine professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

It was built in 1904 and added to the National Register in 1997. History In 1896, a summer cottage colony was established near this location by D. O. Barto and William Angus Douglass of Oak Park, Illinois. They purchased lots, built cottages, and were followed by other residents of Oak Park - particularly those from the First Presbyterian Church there - followed suit. In 1897, Professor Lucius E. Sayre of the University of Kansas also established a cottage nearby, and several other university families did the same. In 1899, a small group of people both from both the Oak Park church and the University of Kansas purchased 500 feet of shoreline and christened it \\"the Knolls.\\" In 101, a larger group purchased and platted one quarter mile of lake frontage just north of the Knolls as \\"Shorewood.\\" These early cottagers organized their own Sunday school in 1900, and in 1903 decided to construct a chapel. (note: large pdf file) Property was donated for the chapel, and plans obtained from Atlanta architect Harry L. Walker. The chapel was substantially built over the spring of 1904 by Grand Rapids contractor J. B. Ackerman, and the first Sunday school class met in the building in early July. Final details took a short while longer, and a permanent Lake Shore Chapel organization was founded in August. A bell tower was constructed in 1925. Although the chapel was originally designed to house both adult worshipers and Sunday school, it was not a satisfactory arrangement due to noise. In 1947/48, the congregation built a separate Sunday school building, designed by Saugatuck architect Carl Hoerman to closely match the original chapel. Description The Lake Shore Chapel is a simple one-story hip-roof wood-frame chapel building, measuring approximately 51 feet by 31 feet. The building is L-shaped, with large entrance doors in the angle of the L. The building is clad with clapboards and contains large casement windows. A cupola is located on the asphalt-shingled roof. The interior of the chapel has unfinished walls and a ceiling covered with narrow boarding. A small freestanding bell tower and a separate Children's Chapel, matching in style and construction, are located nearby.

It is the oldest surviving house in the township. History In 1839, Rev. George Smith, a Vermont native, established Christian mission to the local Ottawas at this site. The mission was funded by the Presbyterian Church of Michigan through an Allegan-based Indian mission society. Smith originally built a log cabin for his family near this site. In 1844, local settler Isaac Fairbanks began the construction of this house for Smith. Smith's family moved into the house in 1846. In 1848 Michigan suffered from a smallpox epidemic that affected the entire community of people. In consideration of the massive influx settlers into the Ottawa County area, Chief Peter Waukazoo and Reverend George Smith decided to move the community as well as the Holland-area Ottawa Mission from Holland up to Northport (on the Leelanau Peninsula) using boats and canoes. Smith abandoned this house; it was purchased a few years later by Isaac Fairbanks. Fairbanks eventually moved into a brick house nearby, and in 1886, Isaac's oldest son, Albert Fairbanks, moved into the place and added a wing onto the house. He added a second wing in about 1914. Albert lived here until his death in 1914. His son Austin lived here until his own death in 1950. The house was then sold to Andrew Vinstra, who modernized the interior. The house was eventually used as a bed and breakfast, known as the Old Wing Inn. The mission building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 and is currently surrounded by industrial developments. Robert and Carole Pavloski purchased the house in 2003, and as of November 2011 the building was listed for sale. Description The Old Wing Mission is a 1-1/2 story end-gable Greek Revival structure, with single-story additions on three sides. The original house is rectangular, measuring 24 feet by 30 feet, clad with clapboards and having plain cornerboards and above a cornice with returns. On the interior, the original house contained a parlor, bedroom, and kitchen on the first floor and three bedrooms on the second floor. With the c. 1886 addition, the kitchen was turned into a dining room, and the addition housed the new kitchen, a living room, and another bedroom. The 1903 addition houses an office and utility room, and allowed expansion of the dining room. In 1953, the 1886 addition was turned into a separate apartment.

The variants Yuri Krimov and Iurii Krymov are common transliterations. Biography Beklemishev was born in Saint Petersburg in the Russian Empire. His birth date is 6 January in the Julian calendar used by the Empire, or 19 January in the Gregorian calendar used by other countries at the time and later adopted by the USSR. Beklemishev 's father, Solomon Yuryevich Kopelman, was an editor at the Brier publishing firm. However, Yuri took the surname of his mother, Vera Yvgenyevna Beklemisheva. Beklemishev graduated from Moscow State University in 1930 and first found work building a radio station. In 1932 he joined Narkomvod (\\"the People's Commissariat of Water Transport\\") and in 1936 he served on the oil tanker Profintern on the Caspian Sea, and saw the Stakhanovite movement take hold. As well as serving on the Profintern, Beklemishev was an engineer in a shipyard on the Caspian. He then returned to Moscow and in 1938 completed his first published novel, Tanker \\"Derbent\\". Beklemishev volunteered for the Red Army and joined the Communist Party in response to the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. He was a military journalist at the front and was with the Soviet 26th Army on the Southwestern Front when invading German forces encircled almost the entire front in the Battle of Kiev in August ‚Äì September 1941. Beklemishev was killed near Kiev on 20 September 1941. Tanker \\"Derbent\\" The setting of Tanker \\"Derbent\\" is the shipping of oil across the Caspian Sea. Krymov named his fictional ship after the city of Derbent on the Caspian coast of the then Daghestan A.S.S.R.. The novel illustrates how an ordinary communist turns an undisciplined crew into an efficient, cohesive collective. The novel found immediate critical success and was hailed as one of the best Socialist realist novels of the 1930s. Anna Karavaeva declared \\"In Krimov's story the theme of labour and the theme of rivalry at work are presented with profound lyricism\\". Valentin Kataev admitted \\"Frankly, I am somewhat envious, so well written are some of these pages.\\" Anton Makarenko praised the book as \\"A living proof of the point of view that many of us hold, that a real writer, a real artist, issues from life.\\" Tanker \\"Derbent\\" was made into a film of the same name in 1941. The book was translated into a number of foreign languages, including English, German and Dutch. Beklemishev's original Russian edition continued to be reprinted almost annually well into the 1980s. Penguin Books published the English edition, The Tanker \\"Derbent\\", in the United Kingdom in 1944. Later Allen Lane, the head of Penguin Books, asked the UK representative of Mezhdunarodnaya Kniga (\\"International Books\\") for Krimov to sign a copy of The Tanker \\"Derbent\\". In February 1946 the representative wrote back telling Lane that she was unable to do so because he had been killed in action.

It was built in 1858 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. History Berrien Township was first settled by Europeans in 1827, and by the 1850s there were nearly 1000 residents. Berrien Center was established in 1857 as the site of the township's only post office. That same year, a union church organization, known as the \\"Union Church District,\\" was founded by local residents for the purpose of establishing a permanent cemetery and construct a church accessible to multiple Protestant denominations. The organization purchased two acres of land at this site, and contracted with H.W. Rugg of Niles to construct a church. The church was dedicated in July 1858. Additional acreage for the cemetery was purchased in 1869, and by the end of the 19th century the grounds had expanded to the current . (note: large pdf file) The church served a number of denominations, including the Methodist Episcopal society, Dunkards, and the Berrien Centre Free Will Baptist Church. The Union Church Aid Society was founded in 1891 to maintain the church, and has been responsible for the building since that time. However, the various congregations dissolved or joined other churches, and the last regular service held in the church was around 1919. However, repairs and renovations have been made to the church, including new pews in 1916, new concrete front steps in 1925, and the addition of electricity in 1956. Today the Union Church Aid Society still maintains the church building, and Berrien Township has assumed management and maintenance of the cemetery. Description The Union Church is a wooden Greek Revival structure on a rubble foundation measuring 52 feet by 36 feet. The church is covered with clapboard and has a gabled roof with classical cornices with returns and is topped with a square open plan belfry. A flight of concrete steps leads to the front center entrance, which is a pair of double doors flanked by pilasters. A second entry at grade level is at the rear. The church has seven double hing windows (two in front, three on one side and two on the other). On the interior, there is a vestibule near the entrance and a main auditorium with plaster walls and wooden flooring. The auditorium has two rows of pews, with additional hinged seating built into the side walls. In front is a pulpit in a raised floor. The cemetery grounds are laid out in rectangular form, with three lanes providing access. Maple and blue spruce trees are planted in the cemetery. Monuments in the cemetery date from the latter half of the 19th century through the 20th century, and include predominantly marble and granite monuments, but also a few concrete and bronze ones.

Built 1866‚Äì1869, it is a Michigan State Historic Site (MSHS) and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The First Presbyterian Church was organized in 1837, the year Coldwater was incorporated as a village. The group did not have permanent facilities until the erection of its first church building in 1844. Construction of the current historic structure began in 1866 and finished in 1869. John C. Bennett served as contractor, and the building cost $40,104. Around the time of its construction, the church had the largest seating capacity of any building in Coldwater, and so was often used as a public auditorium. Notable speakers included Sojourner Truth in 1877 and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. From 1958 through 1959, a two-story addition was built for an educational role. The building was designated a Michigan State Historic Site on June 15, 1979. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 31, 1986, and a MSHS informational marker was erected on April 27, 1987. The steeple was reconstructed in 2004, funded by community donations. Architecture The church was designed in the Romanesque Revival style, and is the largest such church in Branch County. The red brick building is rectangular with a gable roof and a projecting, centrally aligned tower. A sandstone belt course divides the largely-above-ground basement from the sanctuary. The steeple, which stands tall, is a major landmark in Coldwater and is one of the tallest in southern Michigan. It is covered with white shingles and features two sets of narrow gabled dormers. The belfry houses a bell manufactured in 1853 by the Meneely Bell Foundry of West Troy, New York. The sanctuary's stained and painted glass windows were installed in 1868, created by George A. Misch and Brothers of Chicago.

Spruce Street in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1993. History The first Methodist missionaries arrived in Sault Ste. Marie in 1833. Rev. John Clarke was appointed to serve in the Sault area, and in 1834 constructed a Methodist mission consisting of 13 log houses, a school, and a mission. Clarke soon travelled on to the Keweenaw Peninsula, and was succeeded by Rev. W. H. Brockway. Brockway was succeeded in 1843 by Rev. John H. Pitzel, ho stayed in the area until 1860. The mission was closed in 1864. Methodism essentially disappeared in the Sault until 1873, when Rev. Isaac Johnson was appointed to the area. Johnson formally established a Methodist congregation that year. The first church building, only by , was soon constructed on Portage Avenue. It was eventually moved to the site of the present church on Spruce. However, the congregation continued to grow, and the small church building underwent several expansions, including a large addition to the rear of the structure. Still, by 1890, it was apparent that the congregation needed additional space, and it was determined that a new building was required. It was felt that the then-new church built in Owosso was of excellent design, and the Sault Ste. Marie congregation therefore hired the architect, Dillon P. Clark of Bay City, to design the new church. The original church was moved to the other side of Spruce Street, where it still stands, and construction of the new church began in 1892. The church was dedicated on July 1, 1894. Three fires have occurred in the church. The first was in 1904, and completely destroyed the interior which had been refurbished the year before. A second, smaller fire occurred in 1934. A third fire occurred in 1941 during a World War II blackout. The interior of the church was again heavily damaged in this fire. However, despite interior damage, the exterior of the church remains almost unchanged from the original appearance. Extensive repairs were made to the church in the mid-1950s. Plans for a new educational wing were drawn up in 1969, and the addition was constructed in 1970-71. The structure is still used by the Methodist congregation for worship. Description The Sault Ste. Marie Central United Methodist Church is a multi-story Richardsonian Romanesque structure constructed of red sandstone discarded after an earlier, failed, attempt to construct a canal. The church is constructed in a cross-gable plan sitting on a raised foundation, with a broad roof and smaller gables attached to the main structure. The structure measures by , and with three balconies can seat 1200 people. A large square tower with pyramidal roof is located in one corner; the tower contains unique arched windows on the first story and tall louvered windows on the upper levels. A circular turret with arched detail underneath its eaves is located on the opposite corner of the south facade. Between the tower and turret, small doorways on each side of a central pavilion are used to enter the church. The east facade includes a large set of stained glass in round head windows. A dark red stone beltcourse encircles the building. A two-story annex of modern design is attached in the rear.

Marie, Michigan. The original church building was constructed in 1902 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. That building was destroyed by fire in 2000 and rebuilt 2002. As of 2012, the congregation is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). Early history 2003 church, built after 1903 church was destroyed by fire The first Presbyterian presence in Sault Ste. Marie came in 1823, when divinity student Robert McMurtrie Laird was assigned to minister to the troops stationed at Fort Brady. Laird, however, was unhappy with the area and ill-suited for his responsibilities, and left in early 1824. A second try came in 1831, when Reverend Jeremiah Porter arrived in the area, also ministering to the troops stationed at Fort Brady. The First Presbyterian Church of Sault Ste. Marie was founded the following year, when a small church was constructed by Mrs. John Johnson. However, in 1833, Porter left, along with a contingent of troops, to move to Fort Dearborn in Chicago. There Porter founded the First Presbyterian Church of Chicago, and ministered to that congregation for he rest of his life. However, when Porter left Sault Ste. Marie, the congregation there withered. Finally, in 1853, Charles T. Harvey of the St. Mary's Fall Ship Canal Company revived the church and requested a new pastor. Rev. William McCullough was assigned to minister to the Sault, and in 1854 a new church was constructed and the congregation was formally organized, making it the first such church in the Upper Peninsula. However, McCullough soon contacted pneumonia and died, leaving the congregation once more without a pastor. The congregation dwindled yet again, until in 1860 there were only six members. In 1864, however, the congregation hired Rev. Thomas R. Easterday. Easterday was considered quite liberal, and the church grew quickly under his leadership, growing to around 200 people. In about 1872, the congregation rebuilt the church. However, in 1882, Easterday suffered a stroke and retired from active ministry, although he lived and participated in the community until his death in 1927. The church went through a series of pastors over the next few years, with Alexander P. Danskin serving from 1882 to 1886, Rev. Harlan Page Corey serving from 1886 to 1890, Rev. George W. Luther serving from 1890 to 1894, and C.P. Bates serving from 1894 to 1901. During the early 1890s, the congregation bought a parcel of land, where the present church now stands, with the intention of erecting a new building in which to worship, the fourth such for the congregation. Rev. James A. Kennedy served the church from 1902 to 1912. Preliminary work on the church building, including obtaining a design from architect Edward Demar, had already been completed. In August 1902, only four months after his arrival, Kennedy laid the cornerstone of the church. Construction was completed, and the building dedicated, on Easter Sunday 1903. 1903 building description The First Presbyterian Church was a Romanesque Revival structure built of Jacobsville Sandstone. The main structure had a hip roof with two square towers with pyramid roofs, each containing entrances on their bases. A metal cornice topped each tower. The structure had a metal roof painted green to mimic tile. A wooden belt course ran across the front facade, and modern brick stairs approached the entryways. Inside the church, the gallery was shaped like a horseshoe, and the auditorium had a central pulpit with a choir area and organ behind. A 1957-58 educational wing was attached to the rear of the building. Later history Cornerstone of new church Rev. Robert A. Bartlett took over from Kennedy, and served the congregation from 1912 to 1919. Rev. R. Stanley Brown served from 1919 to 1925, Dr. John VerStraate served from 1925 to 1949, and Rev. David McClean served from 1949 to 1959. During his tenure an educational wing was constructed and new steps added to the church. Dr. Joseph Blackburn served from 1960 to 1971, Dr. James D. Lyman served from 1972 to 1981, Rev. John Kipp served from 1981 to 1987, and Rev. David Henderson served from 1988 to 2008. However, on Sunday, May 7, 2000, the church building caught fire and burned to the ground. The fire likely originated from faulty electrical wire. Only a few items from the 1903 church were salvageable, including official church records, some of the dishes and silver, some of the stained glass windows, and some furniture, including a pew originally installed in the 1854 church. Although insurenace did not cover the cost of a new building, a decision was made to rebuild. A new church was constructed to replace the 1903 structure, located on the same site. Ground was broken on July 22, 2001; the cornerstone was laid September 30, 2002, and the first service was held in the structure August 10, 2003. After Rev. David Henderson retired in 2008, Dr. Richard Bates became the interim pastor, and in 2010 Rev. Mark Gabbard was installed as a permanent pastor. The church continues to serve Sault Ste. Marie.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. History In 1832, an Episcopal mission was established in Sault Ste. Marie. The mission was in existence for only a few years until it was discontinued. In 1880, the Rt. Rev. S. S. Harris, Bishop of Michigan, visited the city and arranged for the commencement of Episcopal services. A mission was established later that year, and a permanent church building opened in late 1881. By 1885, the congregation had grown enough to be incorporated as a parish. The congregation continued growing, and soon the original church proved inadequate and plans were made to construct a new building. The current St. James' Episcopal Church was built in 1902-03 during a boom in canal building in Sault Ste Marie. The construction of the church left the congregation heavily in debt, and the cost of building the church was not paid off until 1919. The church itself was consecrated on April 17, 1919. A new organ was installed in 1926. In 1952, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the building, the church was extensively refurbished. The church is still used by the congregation as of 2012.

Cochrane established the First Congregational Church of Vermontville in 1837, and served as its first pastor for five years. At first, the congregation held services in private homes, and then moved to a new log schoolhouse. In 1844 they built the two-story Vermontville Chapel and Academy to serve as both a church and an academy. In 1861, Rev. Orange H. Spoor came to the pastorate, and the congregation quickly grew. In 1862, the congregation began work on this building, for use by the church and society. Due to a dispute over wages, the church was not completed until 1864.

History The First Congregational Church in Charlotte was founded in 1851 by Rev. Joseph Dunton. They first met in the surrounding township, but in 1852 moved to the village of Charlotte. By 1854 they were meeting at the county courthouse, and in 1856 constructed a frame church for worship. Charlotte quickly grew, and in 1866 the congregation agreed to construct a new and larger place of worship. However, due to a lack of funds, the 1856 church was enlarged instead, In 1871 the congregation revisited the matter, and purchased the present site for the church. In 1872, they selected New York architect Charles H. Marsh to design the church. The cornerstone was laid in 1873. The rear wing was constructed first, and dedicated in 1876. It wasn't until 1880 that the entire church, including the auditorium, was completed. In 1881, a Steele and Turner pipe organ was installed, and a bell hing in the tower. The organ was replaced in 1945, and the pews were replaced in 1961. Description The First Congregational Church of Charlotte is a large L-shaped gable-roof \\"round arch\\" building constructed of reddish-orange brick. The window and door openings all have distinctive round archways. The church consists of a main rectangular auditorium section with a two-story lecture room section that projects from the rear, with the entire structure measuring 125 feet by 75 feet. Two square plan pyramid-roof towers project from the front facade, one taller than the other. The main entrance in the front is through a central double door entrance, which secondary entrances are in the base of each tower. The auditorium has narrow, tall, round-head windows extending two stories in height, separated by buttresses. The lecture room section has round-head windows on each story, also separated by piers.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and is part of the Historic American Buildings Survey. It now serves as the Vermontville Historical Museum. History The town's early settlers, who came from Vermont and called themselves the Union Colony, arrived in the area in 1836. The first school classes were held in a private home in 1838, and later that year a log schoolhouse was erected. By 1843, the population of the village had grown enough that an association was formed to construct a building to serve the community as both an academy and a church. The society raised money by subscription, and the building and its upper academic floor was completed in 1844 at its original location, a short distance west of the present location. The Vermontville Academical Association operated the building as an academy and chapel. A general store opened on the first floor in 1853, and the structure also served as the town's meeting hall. The lower story was finished as a church in 1851, but religious services ceased in 1864 when a nearby Congregational church was constructed. A few years later the academy and the district public schools were united into a Union School, which used the building for classes, In 1869, the district decided to construct a new brick schoolhouse, and the academy building was abandoned. A short while later, it was moved to its present location, and remodeled to use for prayer and social meetings on the first floor, and theatrical performances on the upper. The building was refurbished in the early 1900s, enlarging the kitchen and turning the upper floor into a dining room. In 1965, the Vermontville Historical Society was organized, and in 1966 received permission from the First Congregational Church, which still owned the building, to convert it into a museum. The building was officially opened to the public as a museum in 1967. The building was rehabilitated in the 1970s and 80s.

Mamilian lived in Sicily at a time when the Vandals dominated the island. He served as bishop of Palermo but was exiled to Africa by the Vandals, who adhered to Arianism, around 450 AD with some Christian companions. One source states that Mamilian was exiled to Tuscany by Genseric, the Vandal king. However, through the intercession of an African bishop or by some sympathetic Christians, he escaped to Sardinia. After that, he spent time on the island of Montecristo. According to a legend on Montecristo, Mamilian defeated a dragon on the island, and also changed the island's name from Montegiove (\\"Jove's Mountain\\") to Montecristo (\\"Christ's Mountain\\"). A community of hermits, said to have been Mamilian's followers, lived on the island, and around 600 AD, a monastery was built. He subsequently went also to the island of Giglio, where he died. Golbodeus's name may be a corruption of Quodvultdeus, a name shared by another 5th-century saint.Recueil des notices et m√©moires de la Soci√©t√© arch√©ologique du d√©partement de Constantine, Volumes 26-27. Soci√©t√© arch√©ologique du d√©partement de Constantine (L. Arnolet, 1892), 17. Veneration According to a tradition on Giglio, inhabitants of Elba and Genoa attempted to steal Mamilian's relics on the very day of his burial and the saint's body was torn to pieces. The island of Giglio kept the saint's arm. Some sources say Mamilian's relics were translated to Rome, to the Church of Santa Maria in Monticelli, and subsequently to Spoleto. Some of his relics may have been taken to Palermo. Another tradition states that Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany returned Mamilian's entire body to Giglio in the 17th century. On the island of Giglio, celebrations dedicated to Saint Mamilian start on September 15 and last for four days, consisting of a process of his relics (Mamilian's arm), games, music, and a traditional mass. In 1673, Archbishop Juan Lozano of Palermo erected statues to Mamilian, Eustotius, Proculus, and Golbodeus in the cathedral of Palermo.George Dennis, John Murray, A handbook for travellers in Sicily: including Palermo, Messina, Catania, Syracuse, Etna, and the ruins of the Greek temples (J.

History Middle Village (Good Hart) Michigan in 1915 - St Ignatius Church in the center The area around what is now Good Hart has been an Odawa village (formerly known as Wa-Ga-Nak-A-Sa or Middle Village) since at least the 1700s. In 1741, a Roman Catholic chapel was established at this location in a bark longhouse. The first structure was replaced by a more substantial version, dedicated by Father Frederic Baraga, in 1833. That church was destroyed by fire on Easter Sunday, April 21, 1889. Construction immediately began on the current church as a replacement. Father Servatius Altmicks from Harbor Springs hired a local carpenter to manage the construction, and much of the work was done by the local Odawa. The new church was dedicated by Rt. Reverend Bishop Richter on September 13, 1889. The church has undergone a substantial restoration and is open to the public for Sunday mass in July and August, and for weddings and funerals. It is one of the four churches making up the Catholic community of L'Arbre Croche.

The mission was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. History In 1856, Father Lawrence Lautishar attempted to construct a church near this site, but ran into resistance from Protestant missionaries who settled in the area in 1852. Bishop Frederic Baraga requested Lautishar halt construction, and in 1858, Baraga and Indian agent A.W. Fitch effected a compromise between the factions and a site farther from the Protestant mission was agreed upon. In 1859, a carpenter, Jean Baptiste Trotochard, donated an acre of land on which to locate the mission church. Baraga accepted the offer and engaged Trotochard to construct a church. The new church was blessed by Bishop Baraga on July 23, 1860. Native Americans worshipped at this church until 1896. Petoskey's St. Francis Xavier Church oversees the Solanus property.

It was located in the city of Bloemfontein, Free State, South Africa. Construction at the site began in 1927, and the facility was closed in 1972. Other observatories that UM has operated include the Detroit Observatory (Ann Arbor, Michigan, 1854), the Angell Hall Observatory (Ann Arbor, Michigan, 1927), the McMath-Hulbert Observatory (Lake Angelus, Michigan, 1930), the Portage Lake Observatory (Dexter, Michigan, 1948), and the Peach Mountain Observatory (Dexter, Michigan, 1955). History The LHO was the project of two people: Robert P. Lamont, an industrialist, and William J. Hussey, a Professor of Astronomy at UM, and director of the Detroit Observatory. The two men shared a room while attending UM, and were friends from that time. Lamont agreed to fund an observatory in the Southern Hemisphere in 1910. However, the First World War intervened and the project was on hold for several years. In 1923, Hussey visited South Africa and selected Naval Hill in Bloemfontein as the site for the observatory. After the telescope was completed and shipped to South Africa in 1926, Hussey and another UM professor, R. A. Rossiter, left Michigan for the observatory site. During a stopover in London, Hussey died suddenly. Rossiter continued the journey, and oversaw construction of the observatory building for the next two years. He became the director of the LHO when it opened, and remained in that position until retiring in 1952. The facility in Bloemfontein was largely unused from when Rossiter retired until 1963, when it was officially re-opened by Frank Holden. The observatory was not an important research facility in its later years due to its relatively small telescope, which had been greatly surpassed in size by reflecting telescopes like the 200-inch Hale Telescope. In its last few years, the main task performed was a re-examination Rossiter's catalogues of binary stars. It was closed in 1972, and two years later the building was given to the Performing Arts Council of Free State in Bloemfontein, which turned it into the Observatory Theatre, also known as the Sterrewag Theatre. The building became re-used as a planetarium, the first digital planetarium in sub-Saharan Africa, and opened in November 2013. The internal appearance of the original dome, brick walls, and rotation mechanisms has been retained. A suspended and tilted projection dome hangs over the seating area, and a Sky-Skan digital planetarium is now housed inside the Naval Hill Planetarium facility. Telescopes The LHO's primary instrument was a refracting telescope for its entire span of operations. The lenses for the telescope were initially ordered in 1911, but due to the First World War, the two lens blanks were not delivered by Carl Zeiss Jena until 1923. They were then figured by James B. McDowell and Frederick Hageman of John A. Brashear, Co., a process which took over a year. The finished lenses were sent to Ann Arbor, where they were integrated into the great refractor built by the Detroit Observatory's machine shop. The device was tested in Michigan and then shipped to South Africa, where it was installed and began operating in 1928. The 27-inch telescope's foremost use was to study binary stars, a subject of great interest to both Hussey and Rossiter. In 1956 it was used by Earl C. Slipher to photograph Mars at opposition. In 1974, after closure of the observatory, the telescope was dismantled and the lenses were shipped back to Michigan. The telescope tube and other parts remained in South Africa, and are on display at the Erlich Park Fire Station Museum. In January 2019 the telescope tube and other parts were reassembled as an exhibit at the Naval Hill Planetarium. A refractor originally located at Mount Wilson Observatory was installed in 1948 and used to search for strong H-alpha- emitting objects. It was removed and sent back to California in 1951. The fate of a Alvan Clark and Sons refractor used at LHO is unknown.

He was first elected as Liberal MP for Spalding at the January 1910 general election. In 1916, he joined the Royal Flying Corps and was killed in a flying accident on 30 August 1917.The Times, 31 August 1917 p4 Candidates During the war a truce operated between the political parties which usually meant that by-elections went uncontested and the party holding the seat at the vacancy could put up a candidate who would not be opposed. However this truce was sometimes broken by Independents Chris Cook and John Ramsden, By-elections in British politics; UCL Press, 1997 p135 and in September 1917, Mr A Montagu Lyons (almost certainly the same Abraham Montagu Lyons who was later Conservative MP for Leicester East), published an appeal to the electors of Spalding indicating he would be prepared to stand as an Independent. He called for an overhaul of the conscription process, an increase in the pay of soldiers, sailors and airmen, the proper care of demobilized servicemen, the setting up of a Ministry of Health, air reprisals on enemy territory and a programme of national reconstruction. Lyons, a solicitor by profession, had served as a lieutenant in the army but had been invalided out.The Times,109 October 1917 p3 It was reported at the same time that the Liberals were considering a number of possible candidates and that once a candidate was selected the local Unionists would consider the nomination and if it was satisfactory to them would stick to the truce and not seek to contest the vacancy.The Times, 26 September 1917 p3 The Liberals adopted the Hon. George Peel as their candidate.The Times,109 October 1917 p3 However, despite their previous indication that they would honour the wartime truce, the Unionists now seriously considered contesting the by-election. The official newspaper of the local Unionist Association put forward the claim of William Royce who had fought the seat for the Tories in both January and December 1910. At the same time, Montagu was arranging to visit the constituency and confer with his supporters The Times, 9 October 1917 p5 but on 22 October he decided not to submit a formal nomination, perhaps believing he had already made many of the political points he had wanted without actually having to provoke the controversy of contesting the election.The Times, 23 October 1917 p5 In the circumstances the Unionists were content to honour the wartime truce and no opposing candidate was nominated against Peel.The Times, 26 October 1917 p3 Their former candidate William Royce would later get to enter Parliament but as a Labour MP for the seat of Holland with Boston which was created partially from the old Spalding seat for the 1918 general election.

The theme is first attested in Greek about the first century BCE. Stories with this feature occur in Asia, Europe and North America. While visual representations were common in Europe from the 16th century, literary fables incorporating the theme only began to emerge during the 18th century and the story was eventually claimed, without evidence, to be one of Aesop's Fables. The adaptation by Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian gave rise to the French idiom, \\"L'union de l'aveugle et le paralytique\\" (\\"the union of the blind man and the lame\\"), used ironically in reference to any unpromising partnership. Western Asian sources A group of four epigrams in the Greek Anthology concern a blind man and a lame. Plato the Younger states the situation in two wittily contrasting lines: :::A blind man carried a lame man on his back, :::lending him his feet and borrowing from him his eyes. The three others, who include Leonidas of Alexandria and Antiphilus of Byzantium, comment that by combining in this way the two make a perfect whole.III.11, 12, 13, 13b A West Asian story based on this trope is found in a pseudo-biblical document, the Apocryphon of Ezekiel, in which the two form a partnership to raid an orchard but claim their innocence by pointing out their disabilities. A variation of the story appears in the Jewish Talmud (Sanhedrin 91)Richard N. Longenecker, The challenge of Jesus' parables, Grand Rapids, Michigan 2000 pp.64-5 and yet another is told in Islamic tradition as occurring during the boyhood of Jesus.Muhammad Ata Ur-Rahim, Ahmad Thomson, Jesus, prophet of Isam, Norwich UK, 1977 p.20 That the basic situation of the two helping each other was still known in Mediaeval times is suggested by its appearance among the Latin stories in the Gesta Romanorum at the turn of the 14th century. There an emperor declares a general feast and the lame man proposes the means of getting there to the blind.University of Michigan In the same century a paralytic boy mounted on a blind man's shoulders appears in a fresco in Lesnovo monastery, seeking a cure for their leprosy and suggesting a similar lesson in co-operation to overcome disabilities.Marija T. V‚Äôlckova-Laskoska and Dimitri S. Laskoski, \\"The Blind Man and the Paralytic Boy of Lesnovo: Diagnosis of Borderline Lepromatous Leprosy After 660 Years?\\", Arch Dermatol. 2009, 145(9):1047 European emblems New life was given to the theme in the Renaissance when Andrea Alciato adapted the epigram by Leonidas into Latin and used it in his Book of Emblems (1534) to symbolise the theme of mutual support (mutuum auxilium).Emblem 161 Other illustrated emblem books were to give the theme new interpretations. Jan Sadeler's Emblemata evangelica ad XII signa coelestia (Antwerp, 1585) pictures the pair crossing a plank bridge in the lower foreground of a majestic landscape, with Latin epigraphs exhorting charity.Flickr In the Emblemata saecularia (Oppenheim, 1596) of Johann Theodor de Bry, the illustration is dependent on Alciato's, particularly in the detail of the deformed leg; it also references the trope of the Elm and the Vine, another of Alciato's emblems. Combining the meaning of both, the print carries the epigraph Mutua si fuerint studia, hic servatur et illa, \\"Each is served where the objectives are common\\" (plate 46).French government culture site The theme of mutual support was also carried forward into an 18th-century Low Countries print titled \\"The Allegory of Poverty\\", where the blind man carrying a cripple appears once again in a rural setting, with the addition of a huntsman defending a sleeping man from a feral dog.Flickr European fables Though the theme was common enough in art, it does not appear in fable collections until Christian F√ºrchtegott Gellert included it in his verse collection Fabeln und Erz√§hlungen (1746-1748). In this a blind man in the street asks a cripple for help and suggests how they can aid each other. The moral he draws is a wider one, that mutual support goes beyond charity to become a model for all of society: ::The gifts of others thou hast not, ::While others want what thou hast got; ::And from this imperfection springs ::The good that social virtue brings.Albert Baskerville, The poetry of Germany, New York 1854, pp.7-8 When Robert Dodsley adapted the story in the \\"Modern Fables\\" section of his Select fables of Esop and other fabulists (1754), he gave it a context from which later versions of the story were to develop. In his prose version, the two meet at \\"a difficult place in the road\\" and Dodsley follows Gellert in prefacing it with the comment that \\"the wants and weaknesses of individuals form the connections of society\\".Fable 36 Dodsley's version was later illustrated by Thomas Bewick and included in his Select Fables of Aesop (1818).A tailpiece adapted for British Birds II (1804) Authors up to then had been careful to mention that their collections contained fables by Aesop \\"and others\\", but during the 19th century the story was often to be ascribed simply to Aesop. An illustration of the parable in Jefferys Taylor's Aesop in Rhyme, 1820 The nature of Dodsley's \\"difficult place\\" is redefined as \\"a dangerous place\\" in Jefferys Taylor's Aesop in Rhyme (1820), which the illustration reveals to be planks laid over a brook, not unlike the hazard over which the pair are crossing in Sadeler's emblem.pp.65-6 But in Brooke Boothby's treatment of the story in his Fables and Satires (1809), the two meet at a ford and help each other across,II.32 as also happens in Marmarduke Park‚Äôs Aesop in Rhyme or old friends in a new dress (Philadelphia 1852.p.185 New forms of the fable were also to appear elsewhere in Europe. The French fabulist Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian gives his story of L'aveugle et le paralytique a completely different urban setting in Asia. The poem is prefaced by a saying of Confucius that the sharing of trouble lightens it and tells of two beggars who enter into a pact of mutual aid. There were two translations of this fable into English. The one by the Rev. William Lipscomb (1754-1842) ends with the sentiment \\"Your eyes to me their aid shall lend/ And I‚Äôll be hands and feet to you,\\" suggesting that the author was acquainted with the story's origin in the epigrams from the Greek Anthology.Poems and Translations (London 1830), p.131-2 The other translation, by the Canadian poet Sarah Ann Curzon, was more diffuse and appeared in 1887.Secord, the Heroine of 1812: A Drama, and Other Poems, (Toronto 1887), pp.149-50 The sceptical Polish bishop Ignacy Krasicki told a story with a completely different ending in his Fables and Parables (1779). There the blind man pays no heed to his lame guide until, after various mishaps, they fall over a precipice.See Wikisource A lame beggar riding on the back of a blind man takes the story to an even further remove in The Cat and the Moon (1924), the mask play written by the Irish poet W. B. Yeats. The argumentative pair co-operate as they search out the holy well of Saint Colman but are never reconciled. Though both are cured of their afflictions, it is in their own individual way.Text online Coincidentally, a similar pair are miraculously cured while fleeing from an earthquake together in a Hopi traditional tale first collected in 1905, but there the similarity ends. These two act in perfect concord.H.R. Voth, The Traditions of the Hopi, Chicago 1905, pp.151-2 Visual interpretations Though Claris de Florian's version of the fable achieved lasting popularity, its Chinese setting seems to have been largely ignored by illustrators. Notable exceptions include Benjamin Rabier's 1906 broadsheet with the fable accompanied by Chinese-style illustrationsFlickr and Armand Rape√±o's illustration in a 1949 edition of Florian's fables.Photobucket Even these, however, fall short of picturing an urban setting. The fable was also given a Japanese background in an edition illustrated by traditional woodcuts published from Tokyo in 1895.By Kano Tobonobu Two later Belgian treatments are notable for being set in rural locations and compassionate treatment of the subject. Eugene Laermans varies the scene by picturing the pair side by side as they cross a stone bridge, the blind man with a cane in his right hand, the lame with a crutch in his left and his own right hand hooked through the other‚Äôs arm.Flickr The Symbolist Anto Carte's painting of 1926-1930 places the pair in a Brabant landscape with the recognisable spire of the church at Ohain downslope.MuCity visual arts magazine It was this scene which was subsequently reused on a 1954 set of Belgian charity stamps.Illustrated online Turcan's 1883 rendering of the fable Previously there had been several compassionate treatments in French art exhibited over the last quarter of the 19th century. Auguste-Barth√©lemy Glaize's painting for the 1877 SalonExhibition catalogue was notable enough to be made part of the French exhibit at the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 and his own lithograph of it appeared in the programme.View online A contemporary account describes it as \\"One of the largest paintings ... and among the best of its kind. With staff in hand, striding vigorously over a rough country road, a man with sightless orbs is bearing on his back one stricken and wasted by paralysis, whose piercing and lustrous gaze gives stronger accentuation to the theme\\".Hubert Howe Bancroft, The Book of the Fair (Chicago 1893), Ch.21, p.701 In the 1883 Salon there were no less than three statues of L'aveugle et le paralytique on show. The most celebrated was by Jean Turcan, whose plaster model of the subject received a first class medal. Subsequently the French state arranged for him to carve it in marble and this version was exhibited at the 1888 Salon, when it received a medal of honour. The next year it was given a further prize at the Universal Exhibition and afterwards was placed in the Mus√©e du Luxembourg. In 1927 it was moved to Arles, Turcan's birthplace, where it has remained.Marseille, ville sculpt√©e A bronze version was also created for Marseilles, the city that had provided him with a bursary to study sculpture, but this was to be melted down during World War II. When the marble statue was photographed by the state in 1888, it is to be noted that the fable was attributed to Aesop, not Florian.Government cultural site A similar fate was to come to the bronze statues of the two other exhibits at the 1883 Salon. Gustave Michel received a travel bursary for his plaster model.Government cultural site The bronze version was located in Paris in the Square Tenon (now the Square Edouard Vaillant) and was melted down during World War II.A postcard view The statue by Joseph Carlier was placed in a public park in his native Cambrai, a town occupied by the Germans during World War I. It was therefore requisitioned and melted down even earlier.A postcard view Turcan's marble statue is therefore the sole survivor of this period and is representative of what were somewhat similar designs. In Germany too there were compassionate treatments of the theme by Expressionist Christian artists, both dating from 1919. Ernst Gerlach produced his Der Blind und Der Lahme as a stucco relief of two peasants.Art Sales Index Richard Seewald published his woodcut in the Bavarian magazine M√ºnchner Bl√§tter f√ºr Dichtung und Graphik. In it the motif of crossing a river on a narrow plank returns and an angel hovering in the background underlines the earlier Christian connotation of the emblem tradition.Museum of Modern Art Adaptations Honor√© Daumier used Florian's fable for purposes of political satire in a caricature, \\"Blind system and paralytic diplomacy\\", published in Le Charivari in 1834. It pictures King Louis Philippe staggering under the weight of Talleyrand.View online Such treatment contributed to the emergence of the French idiom, \\"L'union de l'aveugle et le paralytique\\" (\\"the union of the blind man and the lame\\"), that drew on Florian's poem but was used ironically in reference to any unpromising partnership. Another such appears in a poster by Jules Grandjouan (1875-1968) with reference to conflicting interests in the Edouard Herriot government of 1924.Irina Nikiforova, \\"The illustrated poster as a mirror of life\\", Heritage, Moscow 2011 vol.2, p.31 The situation was used to more positive effect during World War I to illustrate the care of soldiers for each other on the battlefield. Lucien Jonas pictured such a scene under the heading of Devotion in his album Les Grandes Vertus Fran√ßaises,Les Grandes Vertus Fran√ßaises, album de lithographies de Lucien Jonas, Paris 1916, Plate 17 drawing on Turcan's statue for the detail of the wounded soldier holding the blinded soldier's arm to guide him. The theme was repeated on a contemporary Belgian lapel badge inscribed on the back with Hommage aux soldats invalides (Hommage to invalided soldiers).Lefebure n¬∞3222 Turcan's statue also formed the basis for a satirical photomontage during World War II.

It operated from 1936-1976\\\\. History Prior to the Civil War, black children were not allowed to receive an education in Missouri. After the Civil War, schooling started for black students, such as Douglass Elementary School in the 1890s, which evolved into Douglass High School in the 1920s. Black communities in St. Louis were in such areas as North Webster, and Kinloch. In the 1930s, there was no high school whatsoever in Kinloch, for blacks or whites. Black children in Kinloch who wished to go to high school had to travel to other parts of the city such as Sumner High School (if they could afford the tuition) or Douglass High School (if they could somehow prove residency in far off Webster Groves). White students traveled to Normandy High School, Ritenour High School, or Ferguson High School. The black population was outpacing that of the whites, so in 1936, the Dunbar elementary school began hosting a high school program for local black students. The Kinloch school board also received approval from the Works Progress Administration for the construction of a new high school, which turned into plans for two separate but equal school buildings, one for blacks and one for whites. The decision was controversial, as many white families were opposed to the idea of a black high school, and there was pressure to split the school district into two. Three attempts to split were struck down, after which some white citizens countered by forming a separate city, Berkeley, Missouri, which had its boundaries carefully drawn so as to only include white families. The new city had its own school district, the Berkeley School District. The \\"white\\" Kinloch high school was renamed as Berkeley High School, and the \\"black\\" school was opened in 1938 as Kinloch High School, with its own board of education formed by the black residents. Kinloch became the second high school for black students in St. Louis County. In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court banned school segregation, but the residents of Kinloch and Berkeley ignored the ruling, claiming that the separate but adjoining districts allowed the continued separation. Segregation was maintained until 1971, when the U.S. Justice Department ordered the segregation unlawful. In 1973, when the Kinloch school had approximately 350 students, the Missouri State Board of Education merged the Kinloch and Berkeley into the Ferguson-Florissant school district, creating one large district with approximately 22,000 students. Kinloch's teachers were reassigned to other schools in the district, and the students transferred to McCluer North High School. The school was eventually demolished, in part to make way for an expansion of the Lambert Airport. Principals *Orthel T. Roberts, (1936 - 1937) 1st Principal) * Lucye Belue, (1944-1974)Wright. p. 42.

It originates in the city of Rovigo in the Veneto region of north-eastern Italy, from which it takes its name. It was created between 1959 and 1965, principally from Sussex and Rhode Island Red parentage.  History  The Ermellinata di Rovigo was created between 1959 and 1965 at the Stazione Sperimentale di Pollicoltura, or experimental chicken breeding centre, of Rovigo, in the Veneto. It was conceived as a dual-purpose breed, and based on Rhode Island Red and Sussex stock. It broadly resembles a Light Sussex, with the difference that it has yellow skin and legs, which are traditionally preferred by Italian consumers of chicken meat. A standard for the breed was published by the now-defunct Associazione Nazionale Allevatori Specie Avicole, or national association of breeders of avian species, in the latter part of the 20th century, and is published for historic interest on the website of the Federazione Italiana Associazioni Avicole, the federation of Italian poultry associations, the authority governing poultry breeding in Italy. In early 2012, the breed was not officially recognised by the FIAV. Together with the P√©poi, the Robusta lionata, the Robusta maculata and the Padovana, the Ermellinata di Rovigo is one of the five chicken breeds included in the CO.VA. project of Veneto Agricultura, the regional administration for agriculture of the Veneto. The project includes among its aims the conservation of local avian species of limited distribution, and the conservation of genetic resources and biodiversity, and has published a detailed description of the breed. Breed numbers remain low. A study published in 2007 used a figure of approximately 500 for the total breeding stock, of which about 100 were cocks.  Characteristics  According to the old ANSAV standard, the Ermellinata di Rovigo is white with typical \\"ermine\\" markings ‚Äì black neck hackles, wing-tips and tail; that is, it has the same Columbian colour pattern as the Light Sussex. The skin and legs are yellow, the ear-lobes are red. The comb is single and large, with 5‚Äì6 points. Average weight is for cocks, for hens. The eggs are pinkish brown and weigh  Uses  The Ermellinata di Rovigo is a dual-purpose breed. Hens lay 170‚Äì190 eggs per year. In meat production, birds reach a weight of in 120 days. Cross-breeding buff Livorno cocks with Ermellinata di Rovigo hens produces an autosexing hybrid, with ermine-silver males suitable as spring chicken, and buff hens of light to medium weight that are good layers of ivory-pink eggs. Another autosexing hybrid is obtained by cross-breeding with New Hampshire cocks, which produces fast-growing ermine- coloured cockerels, and medium-weight red layers of salmon-brown eggs.

Pathology ACC are associated with increased serum lipase and manifest in the classic presentation as the Schmid triad (subcutaneous fat necrosis, polyarthritis, eosinophilia). ACC are typically large, up to 10 cm, and soft compared to pancreatic adenocarcinoma, lacking its dense stroma. They can arise in any part of the pancreas.

It consists of the remaining coke ovens built at the end of the 19th century by the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company. In 1990, it was recognized as a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Two hundred were built, because the coal in the surrounding mountains was ideal for refining into coke. At their peak, they were producing almost 6 million tons a year. The development was the beginning of the modern settlement of Redstone. There are very few coke ovens of their type remaining in the West; the ovens are themselves the only remnant of the sizable coking operation in the area, the largest at the time in Colorado. Within ten years of their construction the ovens fell into disuse when the mines closed. Their support steel was removed during the scrap metal drives of World War II, and later they were used as living space by hippies who moved into Redstone. The possibility that some might be demolished to build a gas station eventually led Pitkin County to acquire the land in the mid-2000s, and since then some have been restored. Geography The remaining 90 coke ovens are arranged in a 600-foot‚Äìlong () arc over a area along the west side of Highway 133 south of Coal Creek just opposite where Redstone Boulevard crosses the Crystal River into downtown Redstone. There is a small parking area and interpretive plaque, the only contributing resource in the district other than the ovens. In the middle is a gate leading to the current facility of Mid-Continent Coal & Coke, which now owns the property. Most of the structures are freestanding beehive ovens made of stone, their rounded tops covered with hardened brown earth. Some retain their original integrity; many have decayed visibly over the years. Four have been restored to their original appearance. A set in the middle, just north of the parking area and entrance, is within a stone retaining wall added in the mid-20th century (due to this, neither it nor the ovens it protects are considered to be contributing to the historic district). Wooden guardrails and fences keep visitors from getting too close. History The history of the coke ovens is the history of Redstone. They went online during the town's peak period of population, and were shut down less than a decade later, never to be used again.Simmons, R. Laurie and Whitacre, Christine; , History Colorado, March 1989, pp. 3‚Äì5. Retrieved January 16, 2012. They were left to decay throughout much of the rest of the century, as Redstone itself nearly became a ghost town. A century after their construction, as the village turned around, they were restored as a historic attraction. 1700s‚Äì1860: European settlement of the Crystal River Valley The isolation of the Crystal Valley allowed the native Ute people to avoid contact with European colonists until they encountered the Spanish in the late 18th century. By the 1830s, traders and fur trappers were working in the region. The Astor family began supporting the latter during the next decade, and John C. Fr√©mont led the first American expedition to the valley in 1843, returning two years later. Prospectors looking for gold in 1860 were disappointed, but named the Mount Sopris that dominates the valley after their leader. After the American Civil War, the federal government concluded treaties with the Utes and otherwise began to encourage settlement in the region, that its rich mineral resources might be exploited. The surveys of Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden in 1873 gave names to many other mountains and streams in the region and suggested the Crystal Valley might well be rich in coal. 1880‚Äì1900: Early mine development Silver and lead strikes led to the establishment of now-abandoned settlements like Crystal and Schofield further up the valley, along the river's upper forks in what is now Gunnison County. In 1880 the Ute ceded the area to European settlement, in preparation for their relocation to reservations elsewhere in Colorado and Utah the following year. Prospectors swarmed into the area, looking for all types of mineral deposits. alt=A black-and-white photograph of a balding man with his head bowed smoking a cigar, from the side In 1882, one of them, John Cleveland Osgood, was sent by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CBQRR), which bought some of its coal from his employer, the White Breast Coal Company. His visit was part of a general survey of the state's coal resources, and he found them desirable enough that he set up the Colorado Fuel Company the following year to supply the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad, a CBQRR subsidiary, with coal. He had also found the Crystal River Valley's deposits ideal for coking, and bought land there. Four years later, he and his associates at Colorado Fuel set up both a toll road company and a railroad to make the valley accessible. Some surveying was done over the next two years, but no construction began. In 1888, the rival Colorado Coal and Iron Company built the Aspen and Western Railway to Willow Park, west of Carbondale, to exploit coal deposits there. The coal was found to be of poor quality, so plans for a coking facility there were canceled and the rail line abandoned the next year. Similarly, another rail line along the Crystal was surveyed and graded, but no actual tracks were ever laid. Afterwards, another Colorado Fuel subsidiary, Elk Mountain Fuel, was formed to buy land near the present site of Redstone in the area known as Coal Basin. It eventually merged with the parent, and in 1892, Colorado Fuel and its rival Colorado Coal and Iron merged to become Colorado Fuel and Iron (CF&I;), controlling two-thirds of the state's coal mining and becoming the largest coal company in the West, headed by Osgood. The combined company was finally in a position to realize the transportation plans made over the past decade. Osgood planned to build a mining town, Coalbasin, high up the Coal Creek valley, where coal desirable for coking due to its purity and low ash content was abundant. From there, a narrow gauge railway would descend and to Redstone on the river, where coal could be both coked and transferred to standard gauge cars bound for Carbondale and other destinations via the Denver and Rio Grande Western and Colorado Midland. The Panic of 1893 delayed those plans, due to the failure of many of the state's banks and the ensuing difficulty in finding financing, to the end of the decade. 1900‚Äì1925: Peak mining years and collapse alt=A black and white photograph of a large group of men with construction implements standing in front of the unfinished ovens By the end of 1899, 249 ovens, the largest coking facility in the state, had been built by contractors from Denver. They were operated by a work force that accounted for 10% of all Colorado's workers at the time. Coking workers were predominantly immigrants from Eastern Europe, whom the company had recruited from the East. Another mine was opened in Placita, to the south, and by 1902, the ovens had produced almost 5.7 million tons (5.2 million tonnes) of coke. Osgood developed the village of Redstone personally, at a cost of $5 million ($ in modern dollars) as a planned community so that workers would have quality housing, frequently an issue in strikes of the era. Further up the valley, he built an estate he called Cleveholm but would later be known as Osgood Castle. The large work force was often restive, and their strikes hobbled CF&I; at a time when it was making major investments in its Pueblo steel plant. Osgood turned to Eastern investors for help; by 1903, interests indirectly controlled by George Gould and John D. Rockefeller had gained control of CF&I.; Osgood started the Victor American Fuel Company, which soon became CF&I;'s biggest competitor. CF&I;'s Pueblo plant became the state's largest coke buyer by the end of the decade. It was unprofitable to ship the fuel there from the Crystal River Valley, and by 1909 all mining and coking operations ended. Redstone was abandoned, with only a few residents remaining. Osgood, who had largely retreated to New York City, returned to his estate in 1924 to attempt to redevelop the area as a resort. He died the following year, and his wife Lucille completed transforming the estate into a hotel. However, it failed due to the onset of the Great Depression shortly afterwards. 1926‚Äìpresent: Neglect and restoration At the outset of World War II, the community's population was down to 14. During the war, the ovens' steel supports were removed during the scrap metal drives, leaving them vulnerable to structural decay. In 1953, some of the ovens near the center of the group were stabilized with a stone retaining wall, when another company, Mid-Continent, began working the coal seams in the creek valley again. The other ovens suffered some decay, but were still structurally sound enough to avoid collapse. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, many of the young hippies and other countercultural youth of the time were drawn to the Colorado mountains, among other places, where they believed they could live lives closer to nature. Many came to Pitkin County to settle in its seat, Aspen, but some found the smaller and quieter Redstone more desirable instead. Some used the ovens as short- or long-term living quarters. Eventually the hippies left or settled in more traditional housing. Residents continued to pillage brick and stone from the ovens for occasional small jobs, even after they were listed on the Register. While none collapsed, a real threat emerged at the end of the 20th century, when Mid-Continent went bankrupt. As part of the division of its assets, it was proposed that a convenience store and gas station be built in the middle of the ovens, since the only one that had been on the 60-mile (100 km) stretch of Highway 133 between Carbondale and Paonia had closed. Residents, led by a member of the local historical society who called the ovens \\"the soul of Redstone\\", began working to save them. Initially, a state grant would have covered the cost, but it would have required an expansion of the historic district, which the landowner did not want, as they would not be able to further develop the site if the deal collapsed. As property values in the area increased in the early 21st century, the grant no longer would have covered the costs. The historical society needed someone to loan them the purchase price without any term or guarantee of repayment. In 2003, the Aspen Valley Land Trust was able to acquire the property under these conditions. A year later, it sold it at cost to the historical society, which then transferred the land to the county. It made up the difference between the $290,000 purchase price and the original state grant, and the including the ovens was finally protected. Later in the decade, the county began funding restoration efforts. The plan by the Aspen landscape architecture firm Bluegreen called for rebuilding part of the original wharf used to load and unload the ovens from adjacent railcars. In 2009, it won an Honor Award for Research and Communication from the Colorado chapter of the American Society of Landscape Architects. alt=A portion of the same structures shown in the first image, but with fresh stonework giving them a consistent shape and fresh soil in front. Work commenced in 2011, once the county had managed to procure the $800,000 required from a variety of state and federal sources. To stabilize the ovens, all vegetation around them will be removed and the masonry retaining wall partially rebuilt (although the ovens behind them will not be restored, as they were substantially altered when the wall was built). Four of the others will be restored to their original form, to the point that they could actually be used for coking again, save for the mortar being insufficiently heat-resistant. Another 56 will be stabilized without any reconstruction, and the remnant will be left as is to show the effects of time's passage. Workers have found some relics of possible archeological interest inside the ovens, such as a pickaxe blade, though it is not known whether they came from the original mining era or the hippie years.

The series is based on the books written by Anne Gutman and illustrated by Georg Hallensleben. The series was made as a co-production between Chorion and animation company Impossible TV. Overview Gaspard and Lisa engage in various adventures and activities. Though they try to do good deeds, their behavior sometimes causes disturbance to other people, especially Mr. Huget (pronounced hoo-zhay). When they learn that they have created a problem, they say, \\"Uh oh! Catastrophe!\\" But when they fix the problem, they shout, \\"Yes, triumph!\\"  Characters  What follows is a listing of the characters in Gaspard and Lisa:Discovery Kids: Gaspard and Lisa Characters Gaspard's family * Gaspard (voiced by Connor Fitzgerald (UK), Peter Harris (US and Asia)): Gaspard is an anthropomorphic black dog who is the protagonist of the series.

Gaspard originated from a town outside Paris. He and his family moved to Paris a few years later. When he entered the Parisian school, it was there he met Lisa. He is also the newest member in his school. During his early days in class, he was a shy fellow whom the children laugh at because he brought a large bag with a lot of props. Thankfully, Lisa made him look special in front of them, and he got over his shyness. While he is a judo practitioner, Gaspard does have a slight fear of chickens. * Charles: Charles is Gaspard's older brother. He is a chess enthusiast, and always wears headphones around his neck. Though he acts like a snob to Gaspard and Lisa sometimes, he also shows some acts of kindness. * Gaspard's Dad (voiced by Simon Greenall): Gaspard's Dad wears a blue and green striped tie.

Biography Yongming Yanshou is first mentioned in biographical form by Zanning (Ë¥äÂØß) in a work called the Song Biographies of Eminent Monks (), which was produced in 988, 12 years after Yanshou's death. Yanshou lived largely during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, in the independent Wuyue kingdom. This age was characterized by nearly continuous warfare and political disorder. The future of Buddhism was especially uncertain during this time due to widespread suppression and sponsored destruction of temples. However, most of this activity took place in the north of China, while Yanshou resided in the independent Wuyue kingdom of the south, which was relatively stable during this time. Furthermore, unlike the trouble Buddhism faced in the north, the ruling Qian family heavily patronized Buddhist and other religious institutions. He was born in either the capital city of Wuyue, modern-day Hangzhou, or a suburb of it, Yuhang, in the year 904. He would have served as an official before becoming a monk, although the exact nature of the position is disagreed upon in biographical sources. He probably became a monk around 932 under the Zen teacher Ts'ui Yen. At some point he left his initial teacher and went to Mount Tiantai, where his attainment was confirmed by the teacher Tiantai Dehshao. Around 952 he again moved, this time to Mount Xuƒõd√≤u (Èõ™Á™¶Â±±), where he served as a teacher and apparently attracted many students. He is said to have practiced seated chanting and silent meditation. In 960, the King of Wuyue, Qian Chu, assigned Yanshou to be the abbot of Lingyin Temple, which the king had recently re-established. Only a year later in 961, the king relocated Yanshou to the newly constructed Yongming Temple, from which he would take his name. Here Yanshou is said to have become very prominent. He received gifts from the King of Korea, Gwangjong of Goryeo, and in return he ordained 36 Korean monks, who then returned home to teach. In 974 he returned to Mount Tiantai, and the following year he died. Teachings and influence Yongming Yanshou is best known for attempting to synthesize the diverse and seemingly contradictory teachings of the various schools of Buddhism that existed in China. He is often associated with Pure Land Buddhism and Zen, but Pure Land largely formed after his lifetime, and he is largely concerned with Hua Yan in his writings, equating Hua Yan as when the teachings on the One Mind relies on doctrine (Yi Jiao) and these teachings are in the form of Chan when this Mind is directly revealed.Zongmi on Chan Because he held views that conflicted with the Rinzai tradition, which came to be the dominant school of Japanese Zen, he has been criticized or marginalized in many later accounts of Zen history. As a result of this, he was largely ignored by Western scholars of Chan in the 20th century, most of whom worked from a Japanese perspective. Nonetheless, recent Western scholarship recognizes his importance, and he has been an enduring influential figure in the eyes of Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese branches of Zen, and he is deeply revered in the Pure Land school.

It was built in 1849 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. History John J. Auch was born in 1817 in Wurtemburg, Germany, and emigrated tho the United States with his parents in 1836. He studied theology, and in 1845 arrived in what is now Sebewaing as a missionary to the local Ojibwe tribe. Upon arrival, Auch constructed a log house at a site just north of Sebewaing. This proved inadequate, so in 1846 he purchased lumber from Bay City, ferried it to Sebewaing, and began constructing this mission house. The house was dedicated in 1849, and Auch used it as a combination mission and home for the next five years. After Auch moved on, the building was alternately occupied and abandoned over the course of decades. In 1954, C.F. Luckhard purchased the building and extensively restored it. Luckhard moved the structure to its present location, and used it to display his collection of pioneer-era artifacts. Luckhard also constructed a replica of the first log house build by Auch near the mission. Description The Indian Mission is a one-and-a-half story rectangular frame building with a gabled roof on a low stone foundation. The building has box cornices and two brick chimneys within the walls. The windows are double-hung sash units, six over six. Adjoining the mission is a concrete structure, cast in the shape of a log building, as a replica of the first chapel built in Sebewaing in 1845.

History St John Lutheran in 1922 The St. John's Lutheran Church congregation in Port Hope was established in 1868. In 1870, Rev. W. Schwartz, a traveling missionary, took charge of the congregation, and soon, with the arrival of more settlers, the congregation grew. In 1871, the congregation constructed a frame church on this site. By 1876, the congregation was large enough to warrant its own pastor.

In addition to her triathlon career, she works in the American film industry as a screenwriter and producer. She has co-written, with writer Ian Stokell, a screenplay based on the novel All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque describing the immense mental and physical stresses experienced by German soldiers in World War I. Together with Stokell, she plans to produce a remake of the Oscar-winning 1930 film of the book. Early life and education Paterson was born and grew up in Stirling, Scotland. At the age of seven she began playing rugby in the boys' team at Stirling County Rugby Club‚Äîthe only girl in the club among 250 boys. She said, \\"The boys either wanted to tackle me extra hard or were too scared to come near.\\" When no longer permitted to play rugby with the boys, she began fell running. Her father, Alistair, introduced her to triathlon after helping to start Stirling Triathlon Club. She chose to go to Loughborough University on the grounds that it would give her the best chance in triathlon, saying that \\"Triathlon was everything to me.\\" She studied English and Drama as an undergraduate at Loughborough, and obtained a master's degree in Theatre at San Diego State University. Triathlon career Introduced to triathlon by her father at age 14, Paterson was a member of the Scottish and British triathlon squads by age 16. She won the Scottish Junior Championships in 1997, and finished 15th in the 1999 World Junior Triathlon Championships. In 2000, she won the silver medal at the World Junior Duathlon Championships, an event that does not require any swimming. However, she was having difficulty with the swimming part of triathlon: > I was putting in 15 to 20 hours a week in the pool and still not getting > anywhere ... I'd come last out of the water and it would crush me. I was > coming last as a result, so I began to give up on it. It got to the point > where I hated it. The anxiety got the better of me and races were becoming a > harrowing experience. She had dreams of qualifying for the Olympics, but her poor swim performance made it impossible to do well in draft-legal races such as the ITU races needed to qualify for the Olympics. After failing to qualify for the 2002 Commonwealth Games, which she described as her \\"lowest moment\\", she decided to give up triathlon. Soon afterwards, she moved to San Diego, California, where her husband, Simon Marshall, had obtained a job as a sports scientist at San Diego State University. Paterson did not take up triathlon again until 2007, when on returning to Scotland for a summer holiday she entered the Scottish National Championships, and won the race. This success revived her desire to race triathlons, and when she discovered Xterra, she thought, \\"It looked muddy, so I thought I'd give it a crack.\\" She obtained an elite licence, and attempted her first Xterra race in 2008 in Temecula, California using a second-hand mountain bike. In that race she gained the lead on the bike stage, but \\"bonked\\" on the run stage through not taking in sufficient nutrition and was reduced to a walk. Despite that, she still managed to finish ninth. She commented, \\"I had surprised myself because I saw that I could compete. That really gave me the bit between my teeth.\\" With a new coach, Vince Fichera, she won a silver medal at the 2009 Xterra World Championships and another silver at the 2010 Ironman 70.3 California, followed by a victory at her hometown race, the San Diego International Triathlon. In February 2011 she joined the Trek/K-Swiss team, then achieved three consecutive victories at the 2011 XTERRA Pacific Championships in Santa Cruz, the 2011 Orange County International Triathlon, and 2011 Ironman 70.3 Mooseman at Newfound Lake, New Hampshire, her first victory at the 70.3 distance. On 23 October 2011, Paterson won the Xterra World Championship in Kapalua, Maui, despite suffering a flat tire on the bike stage, and falling on the run stage. She recorded a run time of 43:54, almost 10 minutes faster than Lance Armstrong, whose presence had led to increased publicity for the race. In an interview after the race, Paterson indicated that her health had been affected by Lyme disease. The three-time XTERRA champion Melanie McQuaid, who had led for most of the race and was overtaken by Paterson with less than a mile to go, collapsed 400 yards from the finish and required medical treatment. Paterson repeated as champion in 2012, winning by almost four minutes over B√°rbara Riveros.  Triathlon coaching  Paterson coaches triathletes using the name Braveheart Coaching. In November 2011, she described her coaching work as \\"the hardest and yet one of the most rewarding things I've ever done in triathlon. You feel like you just give, give, give and the life is drained out of you.\\" Book Paterson cowrote The Brave Athlete with her husband, Simon Marshall, a sport psychology expert. Film career Paterson had, in parallel with playing rugby with boys, taken dancing lessons as a girl, and studied Drama as an undergraduate. After completing her masters in Theatre, she began a career in acting, screenwriting and producing, and started a film production company jointly with British screenwriter Ian Stokell. She starred in the video for David Gray's song \\"Alibi\\". Together with Stokell she has written a screenplay based on the book All Quiet on the Western Front, for which they have acquired the film rights.. In July 2011 they signed Mimi Leder to direct the film adaptation, with shooting planned to start in 2012. Paterson intends to continue her film career alongside her triathlon racing and coaching. She is working on a project to produce a reality TV series in which she trains underprivileged kids to race their first triathlon.

Grand River Avenue in Lansing, Michigan. It was built in 1916 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. History In 1863, a daughter congregation of the First Presbyterian Church of Lansing was organized in what is now Old Town. A lot was donated to the congregation along what was then Franklin Avenue (and is now Grand River Avenue). The first church, a brick structure, was consecrated in 1865. By 1910, however, the local population had grown immensely, and the Presbyterian congregation was too large for the original church structure. In 1913, the Reverend Richard Spetnagel, pastor of Franklin Presbyterian, proposed constructing a new building. The congregation hired Lansing architect Edwyn A. Bowd in 1914 to design a new structure. The old church was demolished in 1915, and the new one consecrated in 1916. In 1935, Franklin Avenue was re- designated Grand River Avenue, and the congregation changed its name to the North Presbyterian Church. In 2010 the congregation merged into Westminster Presbyterian Church due to shrinking attendance, and the building was bought by The Epicenter of Worship Church. Description The former Franklin Avenue Presbyterian Church is a rectangular, gable-roof building constructed of dark brown brick, with concrete and wood trim. At one corner of the main facade is a square tower with a louvered belfry. The church has an Arts and Crafts form, with large triangular wood brackets under the eaves and a grid pattern laid into the rose window shape in the front gable. Inside, a stair leads to the second-floor auditorium, which has Akron-plan semi-circular seating facing a corner pulpit. Sunday school rooms are nearby. A two-story dark brown brick manse with a hip roof is attached to the church on one side. it is connected internally t o the pastor's study in the main church.

It was written by Stephen Thompson and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes, Martin Freeman as Dr John Watson, and Andrew Scott as Jim Moriarty. The episode deals with Moriarty's attempt to undermine the public's view of Sherlock and drive him to suicide. The episode was first broadcast on BBC One and BBC One HD on 15 January 2012. It attracted 9.78 million viewers, and critical reaction to the episode was positive. After the episode was aired, there was also much online and media speculation, which focused on Sherlock's death. Inspired by \\"The Final Problem\\" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the episode follows Moriarty's plot to discredit and kill Sherlock Holmes, also heavily using elements from the film The Woman in Green. The title alludes to the Reichenbach Falls, the location where Holmes and Moriarty supposedly fall to their deaths in the original story. Some sequences in the episode that are set at the Tower of London were filmed at Cardiff Castle. Other locations used include Newport Cemetery, Tredegar House and Cardiff City Hall, as well as other areas around Cardiff including Broadway and Cardiff Bay. Plot John Watson is in his first meeting with his therapist after eighteen months. Struggling to explain his visit, he eventually chokes out the words, \\"My best friend, Sherlock Holmes, is dead.\\" The episode flashes back to three months earlier, with Sherlock receiving plaudits and gifts from various people for whom he has solved cases, along with much unwanted media attention, especially for his recovery of a Turner painting of Reichenbach Falls. Meanwhile, Moriarty proceeds to break into the case where the Crown Jewels are kept, while simultaneously opening the vault at the Bank of England and unlocking all the cells at Pentonville Prison via his mobile phone. Before smashing the Crown Jewels' case, he writes the words \\"Get Sherlock\\" on the outside, to be seen by the security cameras. He then allows himself to be caught by the police wearing the jewels and sitting on the throne. Sherlock is called to testify at Moriarty's trial, where he explains that Moriarty is a criminal mastermind. Moriarty has threatened the jurors with the deaths of their families into voting 'not guilty.' After being acquitted, Moriarty visits Sherlock and, after explaining that his break-in was a publicity stunt to show powerful potential clients what he is capable of, tells him, \\"I owe you a fall\\". Meanwhile, John is summoned to see Mycroft, who explains that some professional assassins have moved into flats on Baker Street and asks him to watch out for Sherlock. Sherlock and John investigate the kidnapping of the children of the British Ambassador to the U.S., Rufus Bruhl, part of a plot by Moriarty to make others suspect that Sherlock has been staging all his cases himself. He has traumatised the girl so she is terrified of Sherlock when seeing him, causing Sergeant Donovan to suspect Sherlock. A reluctant Lestrade is forced to arrest Sherlock, but Sherlock escapes with John handcuffed to him as his 'hostage'. They realise Moriarty's \\"Get Sherlock\\" has convinced the criminal underworld that Moriarty has given Sherlock the computer code he used to pull off his triple heist, a code that can bypass all security systems. Sherlock and John break into the house of a journalist, Kitty Riley, poised to publish an expos√© on Sherlock. There, they find that Moriarty has created a fake identity, Richard Brook (or Rich Brook, \\"reicher Bach\\" in German), an actor whom Sherlock supposedly paid to pose as a master criminal. Now a wanted man with his media image on the verge of plummeting, Sherlock launches a final gambit. Leaving John, Sherlock contacts Molly Hooper, a pathologist at St Bartholomew's Hospital, where he confesses that contrary to what she herself believes, she does matter to him, and that he's always trusted her. There he reveals his vulnerability to Molly, confirming her earlier \\"deduction\\" that he was \\"not okay\\", that he's going to die and asks her if she's willing to help, telling her that he \\"needs her\\". John goes to the Diogenes Club to question Mycroft and learns that Mycroft divulged Sherlock's personal information during interrogations of Moriarty. Meanwhile, Sherlock deduces that the anti- security program was encoded in the tapping of Moriarty's fingers during his earlier visit. John finds Sherlock at the St. Bartholomew's lab but leaves after hearing Mrs. Hudson has been shot. Sherlock texts Moriarty, who meets him on the roof of the hospital to resolve what the criminal calls their \\"final problem\\". Sherlock claims that, with the code, he can erase Richard Brook electronically. Moriarty reveals that there is no code, he just bribed security men, and that Sherlock must commit suicide or Moriarty's assassins will kill John, Mrs. Hudson, and Lestrade. Sherlock realises that Moriarty has a fail-safe and can call the killings off. Sherlock then convinces Moriarty that he is willing to do anything to make him activate the fail-safe; after acknowledging that he and Sherlock are alike, Moriarty tells Sherlock \\"As long as I am alive, you can save your friends,\\" then commits suicide by shooting himself in the mouth, thereby denying Sherlock knowledge of the abort codes and the ability to prove that Moriarty does exist. St Bartholomew's Hospital With no way to use the fail-safe, Sherlock calls John, who is rushing back from 221B Baker Street after realising the report about Mrs. Hudson was a ruse. Claiming that he was always a fake and explaining this last phone call is his \\"note\\", Sherlock swan-dives off the roof of St. Bartholomew as John looks on terrified from the street, thereby ensuring that Moriarty's true identity dies with him. After being knocked to the ground by a cyclist, John stumbles over to watch, grief-stricken, as Sherlock's bloody corpse is carried away by hospital staff. The episode returns to John's therapy session, where he is unable to open up. Mycroft is shown reading the tabloid newspaper The Sun with a front-page headline \\"Suicide of Fake Genius.\\" Later, John visits Sherlock's grave with Mrs. Hudson. There, he reaffirms his faith in Sherlock and begs him not to be dead. As he walks away, Sherlock looks on from the shadows, out of John's sight, before also walking away. Sources \\"The Great Fall of the Reichenbach, in the Valley of Hasle, Switzerland\\" (1804, watercolour on paper) by J.M.W. Turner The episode's climactic scene is based on the short story \\"The Final Problem\\", in which Holmes and Moriarty square off. Watson's leaving Holmes to attend to Mrs Hudson mirrors his return to the inn in the original story, in order to attend to a dying Englishwoman. The filming of the visit of Moriarty to Baker St pays tribute to William Gillette's 1899 play Sherlock Holmes and the 1945 film The Woman in Green. Moriarty's attempt to destroy Holmes's reputation and lead him to committing suicide by jumping from a building also has similarities to The Woman in Green. Broadcast and reception BARB overnight figures suggested that the episode was watched by 7.9 million viewers representing a 30% overall audience share, slightly down on the first (8.8 million) and second (8.2 million) episodes of the series. Final consolidated ratings rose to 9.78. The episode also became the second most-watched programme of 2012 on the online BBC iPlayer as of May, with over 1.9 million requests. As with the preceding two episodes in the second series, critical reaction to the episode was largely positive. The Guardians Sam Wollaston praised Steve Thompson's writing, particularly how the episode was, at times \\"faithful to Sir ACD's The Final Problem, then it will wander, taking in mobile phone technology and computer hacking ... But it doesn't feel like cheating; more like an open relationship, agreed by both parties.\\" Wollaston comments that this episode explores relationships, particularly in contrast to the spookiness of the previous episode (\\"The Hounds of Baskerville\\"), calling Cumberbatch's and Freeman's performances \\"moving at times\\". Sarah Crompton, for The Daily Telegraph, said Cumberbatch was \\"riding the wave of what has been a triumph\\". Generally praising the series, Crompton suggests that \\"writer Stephen Thompson had been left a little too much to his own devices ... The result was a bit wordy ‚Äì though some of the words were wonderful.\\" Commenting upon the cliffhanger ending, The Independents Tom Sutcliffe says \\"Moffat and his colleagues have written themselves into a hell of a hole with regards to the next series. If they don't explain, there may be riots.\\" Chris Tilly, who reviewed the episode for IGN, gave it a score of 10/10, calling it \\"The grandstanding conclusion to the brilliant BBC series, packed to the rafters with smart dialogue, audacious plotting, stylish direction and some truly wonderful performances.\\" The British Board of Film Classification has awarded the episode a 12 certificate for \\"moderate violence and gore\\". The episode was released with the remainder of the second series in the UK on DVD and Blu-ray on 23 January 2012. Speculation and response to the cliffhanger The episode's cliffhanger led to speculation on forums, social networking sites and in newspaper articles about its resolution. Theories included the use of a mask, a squash ball, a lorry or Moriarty's body, the dummy seen in Sherlock's flat at the beginning of the episode, the psychotropic drugs featured in \\"The Hounds of Baskerville\\", the participation of Sherlock's homeless network, and a cadaver supplied by Molly. However, in an interview with The Guardian, Moffat claims \\"there is a clue everybody's missed ... So many people theorising about Sherlock's death online ‚Äì and they missed it!\\" Moffat noted that one of the central clues was \\"something that Sherlock did that was very out-of-character, but which nobody has picked up on.\\" During the first episode of the third series this is played upon by the writers. One of the policemen who argued that Sherlock was a fraud is seen talking to Lestrade about a wild \\"Sherlock is Alive\\" theory having to do with a mask, even two years later. Shortly after the episode aired, memes inspired by the episode emerged online, considering how ordinary people in the Sherlock universe would react to learning that their hero was a fake. The memes included recurring phrases such as \\"I fight John Watson's war\\", \\"Moriarty was real\\" and, most prominently, \\"I believe in Sherlock Holmes\\", amongst others, the latter of which was used in-universe in \\"The Empty Hearse\\". There was some speculation that the \\"#BelieveInSherlock\\" movement was orchestrated by the BBC as a publicity stunt. Part of the resolution was filmed with the rest of the episode, although some, including hypothetical sequences involving Derren Brown and airbags, was filmed with \\"The Empty Hearse\\".

Capitol Avenue in Lansing, Michigan. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The congregation is now known as Christ Community Church of Greater Lansing. History Lansing's First Baptist Church was organized in 1851. The congregation constructed a frame church in 1857. By the late 1880s, the congregation was rapidly expanding, and a new structure was needed. In 1892, construction began on the present structure, located at the site of the original church. The architects for the project were Edwyn A. Bawd and Earl H. Mead. Construction was completed in 1894. Over the next decades, the church established nine different congregations in the Lansing area. However, like many mainline congregations in downtown areas, the First Baptist Church began a decline in membership starting in the mid 1960s. In 2005, the congregation changed its name to Christ Community Church, and continues to use the structure. Description The First Baptist Church consists of the 1892 church and an attached parish house, which was rehabilitated in 1955. The church is a steep-roof, Richardson Romanesque structure constructed of multi- colored local stone. The building has brick facings which line window and door openings. The front facade has a square tower at one corner, a smaller round tower at the other, and a low entry vestibule between. On the interior is an entry vestibule with oak wainscoting and a tin ceiling.

In 1861, Central Methodist Episcopal Church was officially organized, and the congregation purchased a lot on the corner of what is now Ottawa and Washington to construct a church. The building was completed in 1863, but was quickly outgrown by the increasing congregation. In 1882, the church bought a lot for a new church, located on the present church site. A number of architects were considered, and Elijah E. Myers, the architect of the Michigan State Capitol, was finally chosen. H.W. Coddington of Kalamazoo, Michigan was chosen as the building, and construction commenced in 1889. Construction was completed in 1890. A temple house, designed by Lee Black, was added in 1922-23.

It was built in 1861 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. History The Muir Church of Christ was organized in Lyons, Michigan in 1856 with 25 members as a member of the Disciples of Christ denomination. The Reverend Isaac Errett was the first pastor. Meetings were first held in Lyons, but quickly moved to the Muir schoolhouse. By 1858 the congregation had grown to 148 members. In 1861, this church was constructed at a cost of $3,215.06. The Muir church was the mother church for the Disciples of Christ denomination In the Grand River Valley, and is one of Michigan's oldest Disciples of Christ congregations. Isaac Errett, the founding pastor, remained with the church until 1866, although he was absent much of the time, helping found another church in Detroit and administering to troops in the Civil War. Errett was great friends with James A. Garfield, who visited the Muir church in 1861. Description The Muir Church of Christ is a single-story, rectangular, gray, wood-frame Gothic Church clad with board-and-batten siding on a low fieldstone foundation. The church measures 70 feet by 30 feet. It has a square central projecting entrance tower topped by a cross-gable-roof belfry, with double entry doors in the base. Each side of the building has five Gothic windows with central mullions. On the interior, there is a vestibule through the entry doors, which leads into the sanctuary. The sanctuary floor is made of dark-stained pine, and the walls are plaster. The floor slopes gently downward from the entrance to the pulpit. There are four rows of pews arranged with a central and two side aisles. The pulpit is set on a small platform. The sanctuary ceiling is of pressed metal, likely dating from 1906.

Bridge Street in Portland, Michigan. The original Greek Revival style church was built in 1853 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. In 2015, the church was demolished by a tornado; it was rebuilt in 2016 in a style true to the original. History The Portland First Congregational Church was organized in 1843 by the Reverend LeMoyne S. Smith, who had been sent by the American Home Missionary Society. They first met in a barn, then a log schoolhouse and various other temporary locations. Reverend Henry Root, the first resident pastor, arrived in 1851. Root raised the necessary funds to construct a permanent church, and in 1853 this building was constructed under the supervision of Baruch G. Cooley, a deacon at the church. The original location was on Kent Street, near the Grand River. In 1868, the congregation was divided when a portion left to start a Presbyterian congregation. The two congregations continued independently for eight years, after which they rejoined. In 1877 the church building was moved from its original location to the present site. After the move, the building was expanded, and the interior walls and floor redone. An organ was purchased in 1879 and a parsonage constructed in 1887. The total expenditures from the move and subsequent constructions financially strained the church, which was on the edge of disbandment for many years. However, after 1900, a neighboring Universalist Church disbanded, with many of the congregants joining the Congregational Church. The influx of new people allowed the church to thrive, and in 1913-14 they added a wing to the building. The fortunes of the congregation waxed and waned during the remainder of the twentieth century, with lagging support in the 1930s, but major renovations to the building in the 1950s and 1978. In 2014, a substantial reconstruction of the bell tower was undertaken. However, in June 2015, a tornado passed through Portland, destroying a number of buildings, including the First Congregational Church. The remainder of the church was demolished a few days later. However, reconstruction began immediately, and a new building, similar in style to the original church, was finished by early 2016. Description The original 1853 church was a rectangular Greek Revival structure measuring 35 feet by 85 feet with a low gable roof and sandstone foundation. It had a later two-story addition measuring 30 feet by 36 feet, making it L-shaped in plan. A square bell tower clad with narrow clapboards was located above the front gable peak. A full entablature ran around the entire church, supported by paneled pilasters at the building corners. The front had an off-center doorway with two windows nearby and two on the second story. The side hads four sixteen- over-sixteen windows and a small, four-over-four window.

Washington Avenue in Hubbardston, Michigan. The church was built in 1868. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places and listed as a Michigan State Historic Site in 2001. The parish is clustered with St. Mary parish in Carson City, Michigan. History John Cowman, who settled near here in 1849, is likely the first Irish Catholic immigrant in the area. By 1851, six other families had settled nearby, and Fr. George Godez, pastor at Westphalia, began making pastoral visits. In 1853, a small chapel was built on the Cowman farm. More settlers arrived over the next few years, and in 1855 the parish of St. John the Baptist on Fish Creek was established, with Fr. Charles Bolte appointed pastor. By this time the settlement of Hubbardston, which had started with a sawmill, was well underway. Commercial buildings began to appear in 1855, and the village itself was platted in 1865. By the 1860s, the original St. John the Baptist had been enlarged several times, but the congregation was still outgrowing the space. Additionally, the location outside the village was becoming inconvenient. In 1868, the parish purchased a plot in Hubbardston and began construction of this church. The building was completed in 1869, and was at the time the largest church building in the county. A parish school was started in 1883, using a former public school building located across the street from the church. The cemetery near the original church location was used until 1884, when the cemetery near the present church was opened. A new rectory, designed by Detroit architects Donaldson and Meier, was built in 1907-08. A school designed by the same firm was built in 1917, replacing the previous building. However, the school ceased function in 1965. The last parish priest retired in 2005, and the parish is clustered with St. Mary parish in Carson City. Description The St. John the Baptist Catholic Church complex stands atop high ground at the edge of Hubbardston. The complex includes the church proper, a rectory, a garage, a school, and a cemetery, along with a contemporary parish center. The church is a rectangular, wood- frame Gothic Revival building with a slate gable roof on a fieldstone foundation. It is clad with clapboard and has tall pointed arch windows. The front facade is symmetrical, with a central, partly projecting square plan entry tower. A belfry with paired Gothic openings sits atop the tower. The interior contains two tiers of seventeen pews flanking a central aisle; the furnishings date from the 1940s-60s. The rectory is a two-story hip-roof, red brick building with symmetrical five-bay facade on a random ashlar basement. The school is a two-story, rectangular, brick-walled building on a random ashlar basement. A partly projecting tower in the center of the front facade has arches giving it a vaguely Italian look. A 1960s one-story, flat-roof addition is attached to one side. The in-use section of the cemetery measures 400 feet by 350 feet, and includes large hemlocks, oaks, and other trees. Cemetery grounds include a variety of nineteenth and twentieth century monuments, as well as a small stone gable-front receiving vault.

It was built in 1847 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. According to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, it is believed to be the oldest existing schoolhouse in Michigan. The schoolhouse is now part of the Ionia State Recreation Area. As part of the State Park Explorer Program, there is historic interpretation of the Sessions Schoolhouse provided through interpretive signage as well as through programming by an Explorer Ranger. History Alonzo Sessions was born in New York in 1810, worked as a teacher for some time in New York, and moved to Ionia County in 1835. He cleared 360 acres for farming, later adding additional acreage to bring his farm up to 800 acres total. He married Celia Dexter, daughter of Samuel Dexter, the founder of Ionia. Sessions was elected to the Michigan House of Representatives in 1872, and served twice as the Lieutenant Governor of Michigan, in 1876 and 1880. Sessions had a personal interest in education from his experience as a teacher. In 1847, he built this schoolhouse on his farm. It was used as a schoolhouse until 1898, when a larger schoolhouse was erected across the road. After this, the 1847 schoolhouse was used as a \\"pest house\\" for a time. The building was restored in 1918, at which time the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution placed a bronze plaque on the structure. However, it remained unused until 1958, when it was again repaired.

In a career that lasted from August 1841 to June 1844 he ran thirteen times and won eight races. He began his career with a run of six successive wins, culminating in the 1843 Derby. His later form was disappointing and he never won another competitive race: his two subsequent \\"victories\\" were the result of walkovers in races in which he was unopposed. He had little chance to prove himself as a stallion as he died at the age of seven from injuries sustained in an accident on board a ship in the English Channel. Background Attila was a small, but strongly built colt of a rich bay or brown colour with a white blaze. He was described as good-tempered horse with a \\"peculiar, Arab-looking head\\" but \\"excellent loins\\" and \\"very fine quarters\\". Attila was bred by Colonel Hancox, who owned him as a yearling before the colt was acquired by Colonel George Anson, who accepted him in payment of a debt of ¬£220. Anson sent Attila into training with John Scott who trained forty classic winners at his base at Whitewall stables, Malton, North Yorkshire. Attila's sire, Colwick, a descendant of Sir Peter Teazle, was a successful but unexceptional racehorse who had stood at a fee of 10 guineas at Bonehill Farm near Fazeley in Staffordshire, as well as covering mares for Lord Exeter at Burleigh, although his fee doubled after Attila's successes. He was known for siring both racehorses and hunters. Attila's dam, Progress, was a sister to Miss Cobden, who produced the Grand National winner Freetrader. According to \\"Sylvanus\\", writing in Bentley's Miscellany, Attila had a distinctive habit of racing with his head \\"remarkably low\\". Racing career 1841: two-year-old season Attila was one of the best two-year-olds of his generation, being unbeaten in four races. He made his debut by running in the Champagne Stakes at the Pottery Meeting on 3 August, where he started the 6/4 favourite and won from Gipsy Queen. He was sent to Doncaster races, where he ran twice. On 13 September, he led all the way to beat Cabrera by \\"half a neck\\" in the Champagne Stakes, a race which required the winning owner to give six dozen bottles of champagne to the Doncaster Racing Club. Three days later, Attila repeated his performance by leading from the start and winning the Two Year Old Stakes in a canter from Sally, a good filly who went on to win the Park Hill Stakes. At Newmarket on 12 October he won the Clearwell Stakes, beating the favourite Wiseacre by a length \\"with all ease\\". His performances were enough for him to go into the winter break as one of the favourites for the following year's Derby 1842: three-year-old season Attila's Derby was one of forty classic wins for John Scott Attila remained among the leading fancies for the Derby in the early part of 1842: on 25 March he was offered at odds of 7/1. He made his first appearance of the year in a one-mile Sweepstakes at Newmarket's first spring meeting, where he won very easily by at least six lengths from Palladium and Devil-among-the-Tailors. In the Derby on 25 May, Attila started the 5/1 second choice in the betting behind the 3/1 favourite Coldrenick (previously known as \\"the Frederica colt\\"), a \\"dark horse\\" who carried the confidence and money of John Day's Danebury stable. The weather was fine and the usual huge crowd was in attendance, although there was some disappointment at the lack of any Royal presence. When the race got under way after several false starts and delays, Attila, ridden by his trainer's brother, Bill Scott, made a fast start. He was always among the leading group in a slowly run race and moved up to dispute the lead with Belcoeur and Combermere on the turn into the straight. A furlong from the finish, Scott produced Attila with a decisive run and the colt quickly went clear to win \\"with the most perfect ease imaginable\\" by two lengths from the fast-finishing Robert de Gorham. After the race Scott expressed the view that Attila could have won the race by six lengths \\"if he had liked\\". In addition to the prize money of ¬£4,900, Colonel Anson reportedly took ¬£12,000 in winning bets. On his first race after the Derby, Attila ran in the Drawing Room Stakes over two and a quarter miles at Goodwood in July. Carrying an eight pound weight penalty for winning the Derby, he ran what was considered a creditable race to finish third, beaten a length behind Envoy and Seahorse. Attila was given a particularly hard ride by Bill Scott in this race and the colt was never as good again. Despite his defeat at Goodwood, Attila started 11/8 favourite for the St Leger at Doncaster on 13 September. On this occasion, Bill Scott attempted to lead from the start and set a strong pace, but Attila began to weaken before the horses entered the straight and was soon beaten. He finished eighth of the seventeen starters behind Blue Bonnet, a filly described in the American Turf Register and Sporting Magazine as \\"a very inferior animal\\". Two days later Attila ran again in the Doncaster Cup against older horses over two and a half miles. He finished last of the four runners behind Beeswing, Charles XII and The Shadow. Later that afternoon he was allowed to walk over for the Gascoigne Stakes over the St Leger course and distance. 1843: four-year-old season Attila reappeared as a four-year- old in the Port Stakes, a race for four-year-olds at the Newmarket Craven meeting in April. He took the prize without having to run, as the other entrants were withdrawn and he was allowed to walk over. He did not appear on a racecourse again in 1843. 1844: five-year-old season After an absence of fourteen months, Attila returned for the Royal Ascot meeting in June 1844 where he ran twice. In the Royal Hunt Cup, a one-mile handicap race, he finished second to The Bishop of Romford's Cob, with the two finishing well clear of the other runners. The following day he ran in the Gold Cup but was never in contention at any stage and finished unplaced behind The Emperor (at that time running as an unnamed \\"colt by Defence\\"). He never ran again and was retired to stud. Stud career After a single season of retirement in England Attila was leased to Auguste Lupin and spent the 1846 season covering mares in France. The ship returning him to England encountered rough seas and Attila panicked, kicking his stall to pieces and sustaining serious injuries. He was taken ashore at London, but died shortly afterwards at Tattersalls, Hyde Park Corner. His only crop of French foals included the colts Saint Germain and Babiega, who finished first and second in the 1850 Prix du Jockey Club and the filly Fleur de Marie who won the Prix de Diane in the same year.

It was built in 1875 and added to the National Register in 1982. As of 2019, the church was being rehabilitated into a neighborhood arts center. History Beginning in the 1840s, Dutch Protestants moved into this area of Michigan. In 1849, a community of Dutch immigrants in Grand Rapids established the Second Reformed Church. Both the church and Grand Rapids grew, and in 1875, the Third Reformed Church was founded as a subsidiary to serve congregants living on the east side of Grand Rapids. The original church building was constructed that same year, and was enlarged and remodeled multiple times thereafter, in a 1878, 1887-88, and 1894. The church remained substantially Dutch in nature for a substantial period, offering Dutch-language services until 1944. In the 1960s, the Third Reformed moved to a new suburban location, and in 1968 sold the building to the Grace Pentecostal Church of God in Christ, a congregation which had been organized in 1950. In 1995, the church was sold to Iglesia Resurrection Y Vida. However, the congregation faltered, and the building became vacant. The building was purchased by preservationists in 2017; as of 2019, rehabilitation into a neighborhood arts center had begun. Description The Third Reformed Church complex consists of the church itself, the two-story, clapboarded former parsonage constructed in 1900, and a small single-story, structure connecting the two.

Park Place, NE in Grand Rapids, Michigan. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History The congregation that eventually became the Park Church was organized in 1836 as a Presbyterian congregation with twenty-two members. In 1839, the church reorganized as the First Congregational Church of Grand Rapids. In 1840, the congregation purchased a church building originally constructed in 1837 for the local Catholic parish, but which the parish had not been able to afford. By 1867, the congregation had outgrown this building, and they sold it in preparation for constructing a new church. They selected A. Barrows of Adrian, Michigan, about whom almost nothing is known, as the architect. Ground was broken in 1868, and the church was completed in 1869 at a cost of $75,000. A fellowship hall was added to the church in 1915, and the sanctuary was refinished in 1930 by Ralph Adams Cram. Description The Park Church is a white-yellow brick Gothic structure consisting of three sections: the original 1868-69 church, the 1915 Fellowship Hall, and a 1950 addition which wraps around the sanctuary's front and sides.

A buttressed tower topped by an octagonal belfry is located at one corner. The belfry has louvered, pointed openings, and is topped by paneled parapets, replacing the original spire and pinnacles. The original church facade contained a Gothic portal flanked by secondary entrances, but these have been covered by the addition. The 1915 fellowship hall is a two-and-one-half-story, rectangular structure with a hip roof and a small corner tower. The 1950 narthex addition was designed to harmonize as much as possible with the historic structure. It is a single- story wraparound structure surrounding the front and sides of the 1868-69 church. The sanctuary also contains fourteen stained glass windows from the Tiffany Studios, which were installed between 1904 and 1938.

It was constructed in 1884 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. History In 1853, a group of Bohemian immigrants resettled from Chicago to the area near Good Harbor Bay. The Catholic community were served by itinerant missionary priests several times a year, holding mass in private homes. One of these itinerant priests was Ignatius Mrak, who had established a mission nearby at Peshawbestown. Mrak went on to become Bishop of Sault Sainte Marie and Marquette, succeeding Frederic Baraga. Mrak resigned his post in 1878, and in 1884 returned to the Bohemian community and established a church-building committee. Construction of the church began that year, but the building was not completed until 1886, and was consecrated by Bishop Henry Richter of the newly formed Diocese of Grand Rapids in 1888. The church remained a mission church throughout its life, never having a resident priest. It was, and still is, the only church in the relatively unpopulated Cleveland Township. A tower and bell were added in 1899, and small additions to the rear were constructed in the 1940s. In 1951, St. Joseph's became a mission of Saint Rita's in nearby Maple City. Saint Joseph's was used by the Catholic congregation until 1970, when the Saint Joseph parish was merged with Staint Rita's. The church is still owned by the parish, and is used twice yearly for mass and occasionally for weddings. Description The St. Joseph Catholic Church is a vernacular wood frame building, covered with clapboards, with a metal-clad gable roof and on a concrete block foundation. A three-part tower, defined by sawtooth-cut, vertical-board frieze bands, is located in the center of one gable. The upper section of the tower contains a belfry topped with a pyramidal roof. At the rear of the church on each side are two small additions dating from the 1940s. The sides of the church each contain four, pedimented, four-over-four windows. The main door is in the bottom of the tower. Above the door in the gable is a small lozenge-shaped window. The interior contains a small narthex with tongue-and-groove boarding, a rectangular nave with tray ceiling, and a polygonal apse. The ornate altarpiece is against the back wall of the apse.

It is associated with Fr. Patrick O‚ÄôKelly, a missionary priest who was active in Southeastern Michigan. The church was built in 1843 and added to the National Register in 1996. History The first settlers in this part of Livingston County arrived in the early 1830s. Many of these early settlers were Catholic, and in 1843 the Rev. Patrick O'Kelly established the Saints Peter and Paul parish, which is now St. Augustine Church. Kelly was born near Kilkenny, Ireland in 1802 and came to America in 1821. He came to Detroit in 1829 and served various parishes around the diocese before being appointed as pastor of Oakland and Livingston counties in 1843 and founding St. Augustine. In 1843, Kelly purchased two acres near this site for a church and cemetery. A frame church was constructed in 1846. In 1857, the parish purchased two acres of adjacent land and built a rectory. About 1870 the church changed its name to the current St. Augustine. In the early 1890s, Father George J. Maurer oversaw the construction of the present church, which was completed in 1895. He hired architect Harry J. Rill of Detroit to design the building. After completion of the new church, the old frame structure was demolished. In 2018, the church congregation celebrated its 175th anniversary, and is still using the 1895 building. Description The Saint Augustine Church is a rectangular red brick Gothic Revival building on a high foundation of random ashlar, which extends to the base of the windows. Window sills and caps, keystones, and beltcourses are made of yellow Berea sandstone. There is a square tower at one corner of the front facade; the ashlar extends further up this tower. The opposite corner of the facade contains a slightly projecting end bay with a side-facing gable at the top, creating some visual balance to the tower. It has a high gable roof with a large round window in the facade gable, below a pointed-arch tracery pattern at the top of the gable. The side walls have four pointed-arch windows on either side, separated by piers. Cornices, Gothic \\"tracery\\" treatment in the front gable, and hood moldings are made of galvanized iron. A vestibule containing the entry, added in 1963, projects from beneath the round window. Inside, the vestibule area contains staircases leading to the basement, and access to the original front entrance, through which a small lobby opens into the nave. A small passage leads to the tower, which contains stair up to the choir level. The nave is rectangular in form, except for a shallow, space in the center of the far end which contains the main altar. To either side of this space are square rooms containing the sacristies. Around the church are two plots of land containing cemeteries. A smaller plot, where the original frame church was constructed, contains the \\"old\\" cemetery> A larger plot, near the present church, contains the \\"new\\" cemetery, with graves dating from the 1910s.

The church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. The building is the oldest existing Danish Lutheran church in the United States. History Ground was broken on this church, then named the Scandinavian Evangelical Lutheran Church in May 1868, with construction done by Christian Petersen. However, construction money ran out, and the church building was not completed until the next year. The first worship service was held in the church on August 1, 1869, but the church still lacked a church tower, ceiling, organ, and pews. These were added slowly, with the tower being dedicated in 1888. However, doctrinal disputes within the greater Scandinavian Evangelical Lutheran Church caused Swedes and Norwegians to form their own denominations, and in 1875, the congregation in Manistee renamed their church the Danish Lutheran Church in Manistee. In 1924, it was renamed Our Saviour's Evangelical Lutheran Church, and it operated until 1962 when the Danish Lutheran Church merged with other Scandinavian denominations. The church is open to visitors in the summer and includes a museum about the Danish-American history of Manistee County, Michigan.

History The St. John the Baptist parish in Menominee was the oldest religious organization on the Menominee River in Michigan. It was founded in 1872, and the first church building was completed in 1873. In 1919, the parish hired architect Derrick Hubert, a member of the parish, to design this church building as a replacement. The old church was demolished in 1921, and the new St. John the Baptist Church building was built in 1921-22. The church was used by the parish until parish mergers in 1972. In 1976, the Menominee County Historical Society purchased the building. The building is now used as the Heritage museum of the Menominee County Historical Society. Description St. John the Baptist Catholic Church is a Late Gothic Revival building, constructed of red brick on a stone and reinforced-concrete foundation. The church has a gable roof, a square tower projecting from the facade, and a rectangular wing to the east. The water table, window sills, and hood moldings are constructed from concrete, while other decorative elements are made from galvanized iron. The front gabled facade of the church is divided into three sections by buttresses. The center section contains a Tudor-arch double door entrance, above which is a low, three-sided, pointed-arch window. The bays to each side contain single Tudor-arch windows. A five-sided apse at the rear of the building once housed the sanctuary. The stained glass windows in the church were reportedly made in Munich, Germany. Inside, the central front entrance leads into a terrazzo-floored narthex; from there, there are three doors into the nave. The nave has a reinforced concrete floor and a ceiling which coves at the side walls and slopes upward toward the center from either side. A balcony projects from the rear. The former sanctuary floor is raised one step above the nave floor. The altars were removed when the church was closed, but the main altar's marble base remains. Most pews have been removed from the nave, and the space holds museum exhibits.

The church is one of the oldest in the Detroit Presbytery and has served congregations for nearly 150 years. It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1964 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. History In 1840, a local congregation was organized as a mission of the First Presbyterian Church in Pontiac. A schism soon resulted in the formation of the Church of Orion and Independence, which met in local schools. On January 20, 1855, the congregation organized a church-building society organized for the purpose of erecting a new church. The society chose Pratt & Tuttle as contractors, and the congregation changed its name to the \\"First Presbyterian of Independence Township.\\" A lot for construction was purchased, and the building was completed in 1856 for a total cost (including furnishings) of $3000. In 1917-18, the church was renovated, replacing the foundation and removing the steeple. However, the church congregation remained small, and in 1932 it was dissolved. In 1946, the Sashabaw United Presbyterian Church was organized and began using this building as its home. In 1952, the church was lifted, and a new foundation with a basement laid. In 1958, the steeple and belfry, removed in 1917-18, were replaced. In the 1960s, a new meeting house was constructed nearby for the congregation, and the congregation moved there for worship services in the 1970s. Today The 1856 church is currently used by the Sashabaw Presbyterian Church (USA). In 2012 a workshop in window restoration was held in conjunction with the DAR and Clarkston Historical Society. The building is currently used by the churches theater ministry and special worship services.

It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. History The Methodist congregation in Highland was first organized in 1865, and met in the Hickory Ridge School. They continued to meet in the school house until 1886, when they had raised enough funds to build this structure. The church was built by local carpenters George and Lester St. John on three lots in Highland, donated by J. B. and Betsey Crouse, and was completed in late 1886. In 1946, the Hickory Ridge School (built in 1835) was moved to the site of the church and connected to serve as a parish hall. Another portion was added to the rear of the structure in 1957. In 1980, the building was purchased by Highland Township, renovated and expanded, and put into use as a library in 1982. The library moved into a new building in 2002.

It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1987 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. History The parish of St. Vincent DePaul was established in 1851, covering all of Oakland County and parts of the surrounding counties. The first church used by the parish was located on North Saginaw Street in Pontiac. In 1866, the church moved to a location on Oakland Avenue at Lafayette. The church continued to grow, and in the 1880s, the Reverend Fridolin Baumgartner began raising funds for the construction of the present church. The congregation hired the Detroit architecture firm of Donaldson & Meier to design the church, and the cornerstone was laid on September 6, 1885. The church was dedicated two years later, on September 18, 1887. A 6600-pound bell was installed in the church in 1890. A rectory was constructed in 1895, a school building was added in 1897, and a parish hall in 1911. The school was replaced with another structure in 1923, and a convent was added in 1926. The school operated until 1969, when it closed. In 1999, the diocese merged the St. Vincent de Paul parish with two other local parishes (St. Joseph and St. Michael the Archangel) to form the St Damien of Molokai parish, following the beatification of Father Damien in 1995. The Belgian-born priest was known for his work for 16 years with Hawaiians with leprosy at a colony on Molokai. Father Damien was canonized as a Catholic saint in 2009, the tenth person recognized by the church in the United States. The St. Vincent de Paul church continues to serve the parish. Description The St. Vincent DePaul Catholic Church complex contains St. Vincent's Church (1885), rectory (1895), parish hall (1911), St. Frederick School (1923), and the Convent (1926). The buildings are all located very close to each other, and are all constructed of brick with stone detailing. All buildings were designed by Detroit architects Donaldson & Meier. With similar styles and materials, the buildings of the complex blend together in a pleasing architectural group. Of the five buildings in the complex. only three - the church, the school, and the convent - were listed on the National Register. The other two buildings - the rectory and parish hall - have been altered substantially, and no longer resemble their original form. The church is a brick Gothic Revival structure in a crucifix form, with an apse at one end and a tower with tall steeple on the front facade. Three doorways on the front have double doors within pointed arch openings, and a window above each entrance. A large double window with pointed arch containing two vertical stained glass panels is above the entry. Other stained glass windows are throughout the church. St. Frederick's School is a three-story dark red brick Collegiate Gothic structure of mildly Elizabethan design with a symmetrical facade having projecting ends and a projecting center entrance. The entrance is in a recessed, pointed archway surrounded by stone. Above the entryway is a small square window, above which is inscribed \\"St. Frederick's School.\\" Above is a third-floor double-window opening topped by a triangular parapet. The remaining window openings are rectangular and contain four double hung, four- over-four-light units. The nearby convent is an austere Collegiate Gothic three-story building with minimal cut stone detail around the door and window openings.

It was built in 1874 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. History Dutch immigrants first settled in Holland, Michigan in 1847, and they immediately established The First Reformed Church with the Reverend Albertus Van Raalte as pastor. Over the next few years, a second Reformed congregation was established, but by the mid-1860s, the continued influx of Dutch immigrants strained the capacity of both churches. By 1866, Van Raalte recommended that the First Reformed Church be split. In 1867, the Third Reformed Church was organized and construction started on a new church building at this site. The church building was dedicated on February 14, 1868. However, on October 8, 1871, two-thirds of Holland was destroyed by forest fires which had been burning for several weeks in areas surrounding the town. The recently constructed church was one of the first buildings destroyed. The congregation resolved to rebuild, and hired local architect John R. Kleyn to design the building. Despite setbacks, the new church was dedicated on November 25, 1874. The church has been continuously used by the congregation, and underwent a major renovation in 1967‚Äì68. Description The Third Reformed Church is a balloon frame structure covered with vertical board and batten siding painted light gray. with brown trim. The side walls are supported by buttresses. The original section of the building measures 55 feet by 90 feet. A 15-foot square tower runs 125 feet in height. The foundation is made from sandstone.

The small, inconspicuous, dull brown mushroom is found in groups or clusters on the decaying wood of broad-leaved trees. Young specimens are easily recognized by the presence of a partial veil, as there are no other agarics that lack a stipe and have a partial veil. Description The cap may be somewhat viscid when wet. Dimensions of the cap are approximately 0.5‚Äì2.0 cm across. The fruit body is generally small, brown, and clamshell-shaped. Tectella patellaris often lacks a true stem, but may include a very short one: the stipitate point of attachment manifests as a lateral extension of the pileus, ranging from 0.1‚Äì0.3 cm. The gills radiate from this central point of attachment. This mushroom is saprobic and found on fallen logs of hardwoods in North America and Europe. The specific epithet patellaris means \\"dish shaped\\". The mushroom is commonly known as the \\"Veiled Panus\\". The snuff brown gills of young specimens are covered with a buff white ephemeral partial veil that may be absent in older specimens. The spore deposit from Tectella patellaris is white. The species is inedible. Microscopic characteristics The spores are 3‚Äì4 √ó 1‚Äì1.5 ¬µm, smooth, and cylindrical, and weakly amyloid. Spores are white in mass. Cheilocystidia are present on gill edges. Similar species Tectella patellaris can be distinguished from other saprophytic, white-spored, pendulous species by the presence of its partial veil and unique lamellar attachment. Panellus stipticus is tougher, lacks the partial veil, and is luminescent. Crepidotus mollis and Crepidotus applanatus are brown-spored. Habitat and distribution Tectella patellaris is widely distributed in North America and Europe and due to its inconspicuous and unassuming presence, may be more common than is reported.

Benjamin was educated in private schools in West Chester, and spent his early life in mercantile business there and in Charleston, South Carolina, making a comfortable fortune. From boyhood, he was an ardent student of botany, and after retiring from business in 1867 he devoted himself almost entirely to that science, particularly to cryptogamic botany. In connection with J. B. Ellis, of New Jersey, he was active in issuing yearly fifty volumes, called The Century of North American Fungi, each volume describing 100 species. At the same time, with William A. Kellerman, of Kansas, they published the Journal of Mycology. He discovered many new fungi.

The program complements the students' public school education by providing stimulating, year-round enrichment and guidance. The program is housed on the Horace Mann campus in the Bronx, New York. History Summer on the Hill was founded in 1994 by Dr. John McIvor. After 26 years in the priesthood, Dr. John McIvor was in a new position as Assistant Director of Admissions of the Horace Mann School. The Horace Mann administrators wanted to start an enrichment program for promising, disadvantaged, public school children. Horace Mann alumnus, Bruce Brickman, contributed seed money for a pilot summer program and a group of Bronx public school children were chosen to attend classes at Horace Mann in the summer of 1994. That first summer was so successful that the Horace Mann School agreed to donate its facility for a permanent program and Summer on the Hill was born. After serving as the Executive Director from 1994‚Äì2016, Dr. McIvor continues to serve on the Summer on the Hill Board and act as a consultant to the new Executive Director, Markell Parker and his leadership team.

The interdental papilla does not fully enclose the space, leading to an aperture between adjacent teeth. This gap has many causes including gingival recession, and gingival withdrawal post-orthodontic work. Interdental \\"black triangles\\" were rated as the third-most-disliked aesthetic problem below caries and crown margins. Treatment of angularis nigra often requires an interdisciplinary approach, involving periodontal, orthodontic and restorative treatment. Possible treatments to correct angularis nigra include addition of composite resin in the space, veneer placement, or gum graft. Angularis nigra is generally only treated based on the aesthetic preference of the patient (although serious gum recession may warrant periodontal treatment). Previously, lack of proper terminology to report this condition was an issue, often colloquially termed the \\"black triangle\\"; angularis nigra was coined at the University of Toronto Faculty of Dentistry. There are several risk factors leading to the development of black triangles. Papillae dimension can be changed due to any of the following reasons: 1\\\\. Inter-proximal space between teeth; diverging roots can result in the presence of an interproximal space when the contact point between the two clinical crowns is situated too incisally, diverging roots may also be a result of orthodontic treatment. 2\\\\. The increased distance between inter-proximal contact position to bone crest, example to that is the naturally occurring diastema. 3\\\\. Gingiva biotype; thick and thin tissues often respond differently to inflammation and trauma, thin gingiva is more liable to recession following restoration / crown preparation / periodontal or implant surgery. 4\\\\. Patient's age; the gingiva recede with aging which can cause an open gingival embrasure. 5\\\\. Periodontal disease and loss of attachment, resulting in recession. 6\\\\. Tooth morphology and abnormal crown and restoration shape; a clinical crown that tends to be triangular in shape can also result in partial interproximal space.

Slattery. The film was co-written (with Michael Nolin) and directed by Daniel Vance in his first and last feature film. The film was shot in Todd- AO by Dean Cundey in his first feature film with Buddy Joe Hooker arranging the stunt work and acting as second unit director. Master Jerry Druckerman acted as the film's martial arts technical advisor. Film director Quentin Tarantino programmed The No Mercy Man as part of a March 2011 revenge film triple feature at the New Beverly Cinema, which Tarantino took over in March 2007. Plot Prophet and his friends are carnies and itinerant criminals in Arizona. After robbing a liquor store Prophet and a friend evade the local Sheriff and stop at the ranch of Mark Hand, a decorated war veteran. Feeling suspicious, Mark tells Prophet he can help himself to water at a pump behind the house but covers him with a rifle. Prophet's friend overpowers Mark from behind, ties him up and beats him prior to robbing Mark's house. Attracted by the mass amount of firearms in Mark's cabinet, they are distracted by Mark's daughter Mary who Prophet's friend attempts to rape. Mary wounds him with a knife and escapes in the desert coming across the car returning home driven by Mrs Hand and Mary's brother Olie who has returned from the Vietnam War with decorations and mental illnesses. Prophet and his friend make their escape with Mark puzzled that Olie doesn't want to hunt the criminals, preferring to let the sheriff handle the matter. Though glad to be home, Olie grows more sullen and uncommunicative. Two of Olie's war buddies visit the Hand ranch and reveal that Olie was their legendary commander of a 6-man long-range reconnaissance patrol of United States Army Rangers, with one patrol taking them to Haiphong where they escaped in a Russian ship. Despite the supporting presence of his comrades in arms and loving family Olie grows more withdrawn and prone to flashbacks to the war where he nearly kills one of his friends when the two engage in good-natured sparring. Meanwhile, Prophet and his friends plan more criminal acts where they steal a large recreational vehicle that they plan to sell across the border in Mexico, but the gang murders the family who own it. Some members of Prophet's gang stop off at a gas station where they abuse the attendant until they are beaten up by Olie and his army buddies. Enraged, the Prophet plans revenge and a big criminal score where they will attack the Hand ranch, steal Hand's mass arsenal, recruit a motorcycle gang led by Pillbox to distract the sheriff, and rob the town's bank where they will split the proceeds with Pillbox and make their escape to Mexico that lies across open rangeland adjoining the Hand ranch. Olie bids his army buddies farewell then further descends into a self-pitying alcoholic stupor. Cast *Steve Sandor ... Olie Hand *Rockne Tarkington ... Prophet *Richard X. Slattery ...

The nomination criteria, which will be finalised when the fire season ends, will include emergency service volunteers, as well as fire, police, ambulance workers and Defence Force personnel. The criteria for award will also include international troops who deployed to Australia for the express purpose of fighting the fires. Recipients As of May 2014 the number of recipients listed in the Australian Honours database has increased. It is well known that this medal has been awarded in far greater numbers than this, however the roll has not been updated for reasons unknown. Some recipients do choose, for privacy reasons, not to have their details added to the roll. As of June 30, 2013, 6,186 National Emergency Medals have been awarded, including 84 for Significant Service. Five people have been recognised for service in both the Queensland and Victorian emergencies. Criticism The criteria for award of the National Emergency Medal has been criticised as not honouring the efforts of many volunteers. Due to safety issues many volunteers were rotated out of disaster areas after a few days and unable to spend the required amount of time on the ground in the disaster area to qualify for the medal. Lucy Kippist, writer at The Punch stated the Prime Minister after announcing the creation of the new medal \\"neglected to mention that most of the volunteers who served in those regions were completely ineligible for the award\\", with one reader described the award as \\"confusing, disorganised and grossly unfair way the National Emergency Medal was put together in the first place. Thousands of volunteers across the country also expected to be on that list\\".

Lieutenant Karabulin was badly injured when his cockpit was hit by enemy anti-aircraft fire, but successfully landed his Il-2 on friendly territory. He was awarded the honorary title of Hero of the Soviet Union on 12 April 1942. Biography Nikolai Karabulin was born in the village of Tarkhanovka in 1918 and worked as a factory electrician at the Proletarskaya Svoboda plant in Yaroslavl before joining the armed forces in 1938. He was trained to fly at the Stalingrad Military Pilots' Aviation School and had completed thirteen missions before the raid on 16 September 1941.Zhilin, V. A. (2001). Bitva pod moskvoy: khronika, fakty, lyudi, Bk. 1. Moscow: Olma-Press. p. 98. . A lieutenant at the time of the raid, Karabulin was the commanding officer of a small attack group of planes that hit a German airbase at Smolensk and destroyed twenty enemy bomber aircraft. His own Ilyushin Il-2 plane came under enemy anti-aircraft fire that penetrated the cockpit and resulted in twenty wounds to his back, left hand, and face, but he continued to successfully fly the Il-2 back to friendly territory. Lieutenant Karabulin was awarded the honorary title of Hero of the Soviet Union by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in recognition of his service on 12 April 1942. Karabulin returned to flying and was ultimately promoted to captain and squadron commanding officer. He died while carrying out a mission on 5 July 1943 and was interred in an unmarked grave in Maloarkhangelsk, Oryol Oblast. A memorial plaque in Yaroslavl and an exhibit at the Proletarskaya Svoboda factory where Captain Karabulin had worked were subsequently installed in his honor.

The species was first described in 1962, believed extinct in 1971 and rediscovered in 1988. The entire species may be of only one genetically unique individual. Description Hakea pulvinifera is a shrub which grows to about high and has thick, tessellated bark. The leaves are long, divided into two to nine segments each long and wide, each ending in a sharp point. The flowers are arranged in groups of forty to fifty creamy-white and green flowers in leaf axils. Flowering occurs from September to November but the pollen grains are shrivelled and empty. Fruit have never been seen on plants of this species. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described by Australian taxonomic botanist Lawrence Alexander Sidney Johnson in 1962 and the description was published in Contributions from the New South Wales National Herbarium. The specific epithet is from the Latin pulvinus meaning \\"cushion\\", \\"pad\\" or \\"pillow\\" and fero meaning \\"to bear\\" or \\"to carry\\" referring to the swelling at the base of the leaf. Hakea pulvinifera was only discovered in 1949 from a single population but the species was not named until 1962. The population was visited again in 1966 and detailed information recorded; however, in 1971 a search based on the 1966 data failed to locate the species. It was proposed the species was extinct, the type population having been lost in the construction of a car park. In 1988 a National Parks and Wildlife Service ranger, S.P. Morrison, \\"discovered\\" the species in a localised population on a steep hillside similar in features and aspect to the type locality, using information from Lawrence Johnson's original 1962 notes. The \\"newly found\\" population is almost certainly the same one first recorded, despite certain differences in landmarks between this locality and that previously described. The identity of the population was confirmed by William Robert Barker. Fresh, fixed and dried flowers tested have been found to be sterile, with no evidence of viable pollen, suggesting that the species cannot reproduce from seed. Instead, they are likely to regenerate by suckering from roots running below the soil surface. Distribution and habitat A restricted species found only in the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales where it grows on a steep, barren slope. Conservation status Hakea pulvinifera is classified as \\"endangered\\" by the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the New South Wales Government Threatened Species Conservation Act and a recovery plan has been prepared.

While in earliest incarnations, it constructed new instruments, it came over time primarily to focus on older ones. Primarily a family business throughout its history, it included outside partners at its inception and in 1998 merged with another long established violin dealer, Morris & Smith, who now run the business following the resignation of Charles Beare in 2012. History John Beare (1847-1928) founded his shop in 1865. According to an 1898 book, he had soon gained \\"practically a monopoly of the old violin business in the provinces\\", being both knowledgeable and a skilled performer. In 1892, he divided his business in two, forming Beare & Son and Beare, Goodwin & Co, taking on Edward Goodwin as a partner in the latter and leaving his son Walter to run the former. The company dates its formation to that division. Beare, Goodwin & Co at that time was primarily engaged in selling high end violins and violoncellos, many of which were imported. However, John Beare's son Arthur had an interest in working with older instruments, which influenced the development of the company. Beginning in 1912, the Royal Academy of Music each year awards a Beare's violin bow as a student prize. In 1954, Beare, Goodwin & Co. changed its name to J & A Beare. In 1998, the company merged with London-based violin dealers Morris and Smith. Fran√ßois Barzoni Violins Fran√ßois Barzoni was the trade name for violins manufactured for Beare & Sons around the turn of the 20th Century.

The college was previously part of Think Education which was owned by SEEK Learning. Other Torrens University colleges include: APM College of Business and Communication, CATC Design School, William Blue College of Hospitality Management, Southern School of Natural Therapies, Australian National College of Beauty, Australasian College of Natural Therapies and Jansen Newman Institute. Together these colleges have in excess of 10,000 students enrolled. History Billy Blue College of Design began in 1977 as 'Billy Blue' - a magazine publishing colloquial Australian writing. The magazine was started by Ross Renwick and Aaron Kaplan. As time passed, various companies used the studio that produced the magazine for their own needs and in 1980, a consultancy, Billy Blue Creative, was formed and won multiple awards before it took a hiatus in 2009 and in 2017 sprang back into action. The studio‚Äôs work covers all aspects of visual communications including brand creation and implementation, corporate and marketing communications, multimedia and web-based projects, signage and exhibition graphics as well as advertising and publishing. In 1987, unimpressed with the standard of design graduates in Sydney, Renwick decided to use Billy Blue Creative to open a modest design school and train aspiring designers who would eventually come to work in the studio. A crowd of about four was expected; sixty-six students enrolled and there was a long waiting list. Courses The college offers bachelor and master courses specializing in Communication Design, Digital Media Design, Commercial and Residential Interior Design and Branded Fashion, as well as a Diploma of Digital Media. The college also offers various short courses, including a Certificate III in Design Fundamentals. Campuses Billy Blue College of Design has campuses in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. In 2014, the college relocated two of its campuses to new sites in Brisbane (Fortitude Valley) and Sydney (Ultimo).

Members of the Hinde family were prominent in Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, and Illinois. His sons Charles T. Hinde became a shipping magnate and Edmund C. Hinde an adventurer. He was the father-in-law of judge Charles H. Constable. Hinde was an active businessman, pursuing real estate, construction, and publishing opportunities in Kentucky, Ohio and Illinois. In his early years, Hinde publicly opposed slavery. He also used his newspaper, The Fredonian, in Chillicothe, Ohio between 1806 and 1808, to highlight issues about Indian treaties and the conspiracy of Aaron Burr. He served in the War of 1812. In later years he was a pioneer in the settlement of Indiana and Illinois, and the expansion of the Methodist Episcopal Church in these areas. He contributed to the Madoc Tradition and was a noted historian and biographer. Hinde cofounded the Wabash Navigation Company, which engaged in real estate speculation and dam construction. The company dammed the Wabash River next to Hinde's property, creating the Grand Rapids Dam. The dam was abandoned by the Federal government in 1931. Hinde was an ordained Methodist minister and traveled extensively to advance the interests of the church. He was a pioneering circuit rider in the early 1800s in Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri. Hinde wrote and published religious articles in many leading publications. Francis Asbury, one of the first two bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church, considered Hinde important to the church. He frequently met with him and mentioned him in his journals. Historian Lyman Draper spent more than twenty years collecting documents by and about the Hinde family, along with papers of other important figures of the Trans- Allegheny West. The Draper Manuscript Collection at the Wisconsin Historical Society holds 47 volumes of Hinde's personal papers, donated by his family after his death. Early years Thomas S. Hinde was born April 19, 1785 in Hanover County, Virginia, to Thomas Hinde (1737‚Äì1828) and Mary Todd Hubbard (1734‚Äì1830), as the seventh of eight children. His father was an English doctor who served as a physician to Patrick Henry and General James Wolfe. Little is known about Hinde's early years except that the family moved from Virginia to Newport, Kentucky, in 1797 when his father was awarded a land grant of for his services in the American Revolutionary War. In a letter to President James Madison many years later, Hinde related that while walking to school in the wilderness of Kentucky, he once successfully fought off a wolf and a panther.* Daniel Boone and Simon Kenton were neighbors of the Hinde family while they lived in Kentucky, and the three men grew up as colleagues. One of Hinde's sisters married Richard Southgate; his nephews William Wright Southgate and William Taylor became prominent lawyers and politicians. After a conversion by his mother Mary and older sister Susannah in 1798, all of Hinde's family, including his father, converted to Christianity as Methodists. Thomas delayed a while. Shortly afterward the younger Hinde became close friends with Francis Asbury, who became a prominent bishop in the church. Hinde later described the conversion of his youngest sister, Martha Harrison Hinde, in an 1827 article published in the Methodist Review under his pen name, Theophilus Arminius. Hinde recounted Bishop Asbury visiting his father's home in 1803 and telling Martha that she had better find God, because before he could meet her again she would be dead. The bishop's prophecy came true when Martha died in 1811 without having seen Asbury again. Hinde said she had converted before her death and tried to convert the nonbelievers in the room while on her deathbed. He shared a letter in which his sister had tried to convert her close friends. Hinde named his first daughter after his late sister Martha.* Hinde did not immediately convert but attended Methodist camp meetings of the period. During his life, he frequently wrote about the importance of the camp meeting in bringing Christianity and democracy to the west. In 1801, Hinde got a job as deputy clerk for the Kentucky Court of Appeals. William Kavanaugh, the husband of Hinde's older sister Hannah, assigned him to Achilles Sneed of Frankfort. He received a good legal education with Sneed, who was Clerk of the Court of Appeals. During this time, Hinde became acquainted with many of the state's leading men, and acquired a knowledge of the law. He also developed a reputation as one of Kentucky's most efficient businessmen. Hinde wrote to Henry Clay that he was the first lawyer whom Hinde heard address a court. Hinde resided in a boarding house, shared with many of the leading judges and politicians of the day, where he strengthened his personal and political contacts. Newspaper publisher From an early age, Hinde opposed slavery. Although their parents owned slaves, he and his siblings repudiated slavery on religious grounds. Hinde's opposition increased and eventually he and other friends became outspoken critics of the institution in Kentucky, where slavery was commonplace in the middle and western parts of the state. In the Great Awakening, Methodists were prominent among those who opposed slavery, although they also converted slaves and welcomed them into congregations. In Kentucky Hinde joined other Methodist ministers in the abolitionist movement. In a letter to President Madison, Hinde attributed his opposition to slavery to the influence of his mother. He wrote: > In 1805, Messrs. Wood and Street, from Richmond, Va., found their way to > Kentucky. Friendly considerations led me to patronize them. This was done > through the solicitations of a young friend from Virginia. They commenced a > paper, published in 1806, called the 'Western World.' Imbibing strong > prejudices against slavery, perhaps from my mother's repeating, in my > infancy, the nurse's songs composed by Cowper, designed to make such > impressions. In June 1806, to the great astonishment of my friends, I left > Kentucky, with all the flattering prospects a youth could have, and hastened > to Ohio. Connecting circumstances, and from hints that fell from Wood and > others, a deep impression had been made on my mind, that an eventful period > was fast approaching. Aaron Burr Because of the slavery issue, in 1806 Hinde moved from Kentucky to Chillicothe in the free state of Ohio. In partnership with his brother-in-law R.D. Richardson, beginning in 1806, he edited and published a newspaper titled the Fredonian. Fredonian was a sonorous name for 'a citizen of the United States.' In later years it was applied to an American-inspired rebellion to separate Texas from Mexico. From early in his career, Hinde fought the projects of Aaron Burr. He collected and published material in The Fredonian related to what he said was Burr's conspiracy to overthrow the US government. Hinde sent the evidence to Henry Clay, a longtime friend of his family and later secretary of state, but the papers disappeared. While working at the Kentucky Court of Appeals, Hinde had developed a close relationship with George Madison and his nephew John Madison. In 1829 Hinde wrote to their relation, President James Madison, to provide him with information about the Burr conspiracy for a political history the president was said to be writing. Madison denied the project, but asked Hinde to send copies of The Fredonian to include in his presidential papers. Hinde sent newspaper issues dealing with the Burr Conspiracy. The copies of the newspaper were filed with the President's papers.Boggess, pp. 196-203 After moving to Ohio, Hinde was unanimously elected by the Ohio House of Representatives to the position of clerk pro tempore. He held the position for three years before shifting to focus on his successful speculation in military lands. Marriages and family On October 19, 1809, with minister William Lynes officiating, Hinde at the age of 24 married Belinda Bradford, the daughter of the late James Bradford, in Hamilton County, Ohio.Pioneer Marriage Records, Hamilton County, Ohio: 1791‚Äì1820, Copied by John Day Caldwell, Secretary of the Cincinnati Pioneer Association, before the Cincinnati Courthouse fire in 1884 His father- in-law was a descendant of William Bradford of Plymouth Colony. He had been killed in 1791 in St. Clair's Defeat, and buried in Fort Recovery. Hinde and Belinda had three children: James B., John Madison, and Martha. The second son was named after Hinde's friend John Madison, a nephew of George Madison and a relative of James Madison. The daughter Martha married Charles H. Constable, who became a prominent Illinois politician. He is notable for his decision as judge to allow four Union deserters to go free during the Civil War. Belinda died in 1827. In 1828, Hinde married Sarah Neal (Daugherty) Cavileer. They had three children: Edmund C., Charles T. and Belinda. Edmund was a pioneer who participated in the California Gold Rush; after his death, his journals were published. Charles became a business tycoon in Southern California, playing a pivotal role in its development through his shipping expertise. Belinda married Jacob Zimmerman, a successful newspaper editor and owner who in later years held a number of political offices in Illinois. Conversion to Methodism An engraving of a Methodist camp meeting in 1819 (Library of Congress). Hinde was involved with the newspaper for less than two years. He converted from Deism to Methodism and decided that operating a political journal conflicted with his new religious views. After retiring from the newspaper business, he engaged in locating military lands and in land speculation. For the rest of his life, Hinde published editorials in newspapers and religious publications. He organized several camp meetings with other preachers, saying that the camp meeting could unite the different Protestant denominations. At times, Francis Asbury ventured into the wilderness to visit Hinde. An 1856 account states, > In 1810 Bishop Asbury visited an obscure part of the western country > (Kanawha) which was then a wilderness, and pleasantly told the Rev. Thomas > S. Hinde that he had visited the region in order that the people might see > and know their superintendent; remarking, \\"The shepherd ought to know the > flock, and the flock the shepherd: they ought to know what man it is that > governs them, and I have come nearly one hundred miles out of my way to see > them.\\" The writer exclaims, \\"O Asbury, the inhabitants of these hills and > mountains will long make mention of thee!\\" Hinde is thought to have received his license to preach sometime around 1810. His first sermon was in Chillicothe in either 1807 or 1808, and people were so eager to hear him that they filled the church. The sermon was described as having \\"...no coherence in his discourse.\\" During the sermon, Hinde repeatedly stated, \\"My bowels, my bowels!\\" Methodist circuit rider on horseback According to a 19th-century account, > As a preacher, he was rather eccentric. He was not very fluent and gifted as > a speaker, but had the power of engaging the attention of his hearers, and > was very successful and useful in a revival of religion. He entertained > rather singular views on the subject of the orders in the ministry, > objecting to the order of deacons, and holding that the eldership is the > only true order. In consequence of these peculiar views, he would never > consent to be ordained a deacon, and therefore never entered into orders at > all. Hinde became a circuit rider in the early 1800s. While his circuit varied over the years, he served large portions of Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri. Much of the territory he covered was generally lawless, violent and dangerous. Circuit riders served numerous churches and were supposed to plant new ones in new or underserved communities. They were critical to the development of the frontier. An avid writer, Hinde wrote mostly about Methodism and church songs. He wrote a popular hymnal entitled The Pilgrams' songster; or, A choice collection of spiritual songs, which was said to have sold more than 10,000 copies. Rev. Thomas S. Hinde was said to be, \\"...exceedingly earnest, and very zealous in promoting the interests of the Church and of religion and morality. His zeal, however, was rather of the ascetic kind; and he usually took prominent part in the arraignment and trial of brethren accused of offenses.\\" He was quoted as saying that he was,\\"...doing God service.\\" Indian affairs Vincennes in 1810, Tecumseh loses his temper when William Henry Harrison refuses to rescind the Treaty of Fort Wayne. Growing up in Kentucky in the late 1790s, Hinde learned of the danger of Indian attacks. After moving to Chillicothe, he became interested in prehistoric Indian sites. In a letter to President James Madison, he mentioned taking friends to Windship's mound (now the Hopewell Culture National Historical Park), but focused on his opposition to slavery, saying he called > their attention to the surrounding scenery, my former pursuits, my friends, > my country, my prospects‚Äîall these had been abandoned for the pride of > opinion, against the entailment and perpetuation of slavery upon the rising > generation! I remember their looks when I remarked, that after all, > (pointing to the sun eclipsed,) I spoke of the gloom that overshadowed my > future prospects! Hinde purchased property from William Mc'Intosh near the Wabash River, an area that had been a Piankashaw Indian campground. It contained numerous earthwork mounds built by cultures that predated the Piankashaw. Hinde met the Shawnee chief Tecumseh in Chillicothe and in Vincennes, Indiana, during either the 1810 or the 1811 meeting between Tecumseh and William Henry Harrison at Grouseland. Hinde also met prominent Shawnee Blue Jacket and reported on him for the local newspapers. One source says that Hinde played a crucial role in negotiating early Indian treaties signed with the United States government, without defining his actions. War of 1812 Oliver Hazard Perry Hinde served in the U.S. Army in the War of 1812 under William Henry Harrison, then governor of the Indiana Territory. Both from Virginia families, the two men were close in age. Hinde was made responsible for prisoners of war starting in 1813, when he was about 27 or 28 years old. Hinde served under Captain Oliver Hazard Perry, who was the commander at the Battle of Lake Erie. Captain Perry's decisive victory ensured American control of the lake, improved American morale after a series of defeats, and compelled the British to fall back from Detroit. In 1813, Hinde was placed in charge of prisoners captured at this battle. Founding Mount Carmel Market St. in Mount Carmel, Illinois In the early 1800s, Hinde purchased large land holdings in what would become Wabash County, Illinois. In 1817, he, William McDowell and William Beauchamp collectively founded the city of Mount Carmel, Illinois. All three men were ministers. They chose the Biblical name \\"Mount Carmel\\", because it meant \\"the garden of the Lord\\" and was a historic city in Palestine. According to one source: Hinde donated the majority of the land for the city. Shortly after it was incorporated, he gave permission for city residents to use part of his land near the Wabash River as a \\"commons\\" for livestock. Hinde, Beauchamp and McDowell were granted permission by the legislature to establish a ferry on Hinde's land at the river. During this time Hinde did the primary survey work for the Grand Rapids Dam on the river. According to a local history published in 1883, he was believed to reside in a house located on the \\"bluff\\" in Mount Carmel. In letters to Congress written in the 1820s, Hinde said that he resided near the Grand Rapids Dam.\\"1883 History of Edwards, Lawrence and Wabash Counties, Illinois\\" He wrote a poem about Mount Carmel and had it published in Ohio. Originally, Mount Carmel was located in Edwards County. After a drought in 1820 killed a majority of the settlers, the county seat was moved from Palmyra, Illinois to Albion. At that time Albion was settled primarily by English immigrants. The Americans from Mount Carmel and surrounding settlements were resentful and tried to return the county seat to Mount Carmel by force. During the bickering for the county seat location, Hinde ran for county commissioner in 1821 against John Buckles, receiving only two votes against Buckles' 151. In 1822 Hinde ran for the office of Illinois House of Representatives and narrowly lost to Gilbert T. Pell. On December 24, 1824 the Illinois Legislature resolved the county seat issue by creating Wabash County from the eastern half of Edwards County. Based on newspaper accounts, the lots held by Hinde did not sell quickly. More than 27 years after having developed the plans for Mount Carmel, Hinde was still advertising lots for sale there in national newspapers. In one advertisement Hinde said, \\"The place I offer is midway between St. Louis and Louisville and the next improvement will be the completion of the railroad connecting the two places, and a dam across the Great Wabash, at the Grand Rapids, at the junction of the White, Patoka, and Wabash, giving the greatest water power in the great West.\\" Another source notes that Hinde and other founders \\"...may have been over zealous and puritanical in the construction of their laws... no theater or play-house shall ever be built within the boundary of the city; no person shall be guilty of drunkenness, profanity, sabbath-breaking, and many other offenses of greater magnitude, etc., he shall be subject to trial by the court of Mayor and on conviction, was disqualified from holding any office in the city, or the bank; was disqualified to vote; ostracism was to continue for three years after the commission of the so-called crimes.\\" Around 1825, Hinde settled in Mount Carmel, leaving the Methodist circuit to focus on religious and historical writing, and business. He founded one of the first churches in the town and occasionally held Methodist gatherings at his home. On September 20, 1827 more than 27 Methodist ministers met in the upper room of his house. It was one of the largest gatherings of the time. Real estate disputes After his father died in 1828, Hinde inherited real estate in Kentucky.* Shortly thereafter, he began investing in real estate in Ohio. Property titles were frequently complicated in this period due to turnover of military lands, as well as issues related to acquisition of former Native American lands. Several of his Ohio property disputes reached the Supreme Court of the United States, including Hinde v. VattierVattier v. Hinde, 32 U.S. 252 (1833). and Mallow v. Hinde.Mallow v. Hinde, 25 U.S. 193 (1827). Johnson v. M'Intosh William M'Intosh was a former Revolutionary War veteran who had become a fur trader and investor in military lands along the Wabash River. Hinde and M'Intosh lived on adjoining tracts of land near what would become the site of the Grand Rapids Dam. M'Intosh became associated with the Supreme Court Case of Johnson v. M'Intosh. Chief Justice John Marshall, an acquaintance of Hinde and his father, used the case to establish the \\"Discovery Doctrine,\\" which ruled that the discovering people gain title over the indigenous peoples in respect to land title. Hinde also knew Associate Justice Thomas Todd, a justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals when Hinde served as the court's clerk. In the case, in which Johnson and M'Intosh were claiming title to the same property, the Supreme Court ruled that private citizens could not purchase land from Native Americans, and therefore the plaintiff Johnson's land purchases were invalid. M'Intosh's land purchases from the Federal government were affirmed as legal. Hinde purchased a portion of M'Intosh's litigated property not long after the litigation. Correspondence between Hinde and M'Intosh discussing land sales form part of the Hinde documents at the Lyman Draper Manuscripts Collection in the Wisconsin Historical Society. Due to the favorable ruling in the case, Hinde benefited greatly because of his large land holdings in the area. After the ruling had settled ownership issues between the Indians and settlers, Hinde founded the towns of Mt. Carmel, Powhaten, and Selima in the Illinois territory. Hinde v. Vattier One of Hinde's own real estate disputes was based on property he owned in Cincinnati. The dispute was between the Hinde family and Charles Vattier. Vattier was a known scam artist and underworld giant in Cincinnati. One source described Vattier as owning \\"...a gambling empire, including grog shops, Bawdy houses and taverns.\\" Vattier was involved in a number of other fraudulent real estate schemes with other people in Ohio. In 1807 Vattier was convicted of burglary and larceny for stealing large sums of money from James Findlay, Receiver of Public Monies for the District of Cincinnati. Hinde knew Findlay since they were both involved in exposing the Burr conspiracy and both were prominent in Ohio. Allegedly, Vattier had tried to take title to a piece of property in Cincinnati already owned by the Hinde family. Hinde challenged Vattier in court. Henry Clay represented Hinde in the Ohio State Court proceedings. Hinde claimed that Vattier tried to use the lot to pay Findlay by claiming to have a bill of sale and title that was superior to the Hinde family. After more than fifteen years, the case reached the United States Supreme Court in 1833. The Court ruled that Vattier took title to the property illegally and that the property belonged to Hinde and his children. Originally owned by Hinde's father-in-law, James Bradford, after his death the property passed to Hinde's wife, Belinda (Bradford) Hinde. Wabash Navigation Company In 1825, Hinde joined the Wabash Navigation Company. Seventeen members of the company came from prominent families in Indiana and Illinois. The company had capital of more than $1 million. Hinde was one of the company's first nine directors and remained active until his death. The company charter was eventually approved by both the Illinois and Indiana legislatures. The company built a dam next to land Hinde owned. In a letter to Congress in 1842, Hinde stated that his goal was to connect the Wabash River with the Maumee River that flowed to Lake Erie. He cited in support the opinion of unnamed hunters and traders and George Washington's hope of connecting the waters of the east with the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Hinde also declared, \\"...I have seen the whole wilderness of the West subdued and savages and wild beasts or prey receding before civilization and enterprise.\\" He said that, on the Wabash from the Grand Rapids to Terre Haute, steamboats could navigate almost all year; therefore it was essential to connect the river to the Ohio. He also suggested that an armory should be built by the U.S. Government next to the proposed dam. Dr. John Lescher was a business partner and friend of Thomas S. Hinde. Both men invested in the Wabash Navigation Company. Lescher later joined Hinde's children in a lawsuit against the company. Not long after the death of Hinde, his son James and his son-in-law Charles H. Constable joined with Lescher and sued the company for entering their land and taking timber and other materials for the construction of dam. But, the company's charter permitted them to enter the land and take construction material without the owner's consent, forcing the owner to seek legal redress. The court ordered compensation.Hinde et al. v. The Wabash Navigation Co., November term 1853 A letter written by Jacob Lescher in 1841 and submitted to Congress in support of the Grand Rapids Dam project and the building of a U.S. Armory, stated that he and Hinde owned more than acres of land around the proposed dam site. Additional information submitted to Congress stated that the town of Powhatan was owned by Hinde and Lescher and was a \\"river addition\\" to Mount Carmel. The location of the town of Selima was not clearly stated, but was near the dam. Hinde did the original surveying for Grand Rapids Dam. The wooden timber dam deteriorated and needed to be replaced in the late nineteenth century. On September 19, 1890, Congress appropriated money for the construction of a new dam, to be built by the Army Corps of Engineers. The report stated that the old dam had partially washed away and that the new dam would raise the water level by 11.5 feet. According to an annual report to the Secretary of War in 1908, the mid-19th century lock and dam were \\"...not of a substantial character....,\\" and \\"...rapidly deteriorated and became useless.\\" The same report said that by March 31, 1881 expenditures for the dam were $317,845.44 and the government was forced to pay the Wabash Navigation Company an additional $7,000 to extinguish their franchise and purchase their property. Later years and legacy Hinde settled in Mount Carmel toward the end of his life. During Hinde's final years, he was an active letter writer and watched over his many business and real estate interests. Hinde was prominent in church and Illinois society and compiled many documents and interviews. During his later years, he shared much of this information with various writers and publications. In his later writings, Hinde espoused some questionable theories such as the Hollow Earth theory and the Madoc tradition. Hinde was published in the Methodist Magazine, the \\"Short Sketches of Revivals of Religion in the Western Country\\" (incomplete), the Advocate and Journal (New York) and the Western Christian Advocate (Cincinnati). His writings have been described as, \\"...abound[ing] in vague philosophical and religious reflections-- this is especially true of his diaries-- thus making them of slight value....\\" Hinde dedicated a substantial amount of time to investigating the Madoc Tradition in North America. Madoc or Madog ab Owain Gwynedd was, according to folklore, a Welsh prince who sailed to America in 1170, more than 300 years before Christopher Columbus's voyage in 1492. Hinde interviewed hundreds of individuals on the topic. In 1824, Hinde wrote a letter to John S. Williams, editor of The American Pioneer regarding the Madoc Tradition. He claimed to have testimony from numerous sources that said Welsh people under Owen Ap Zuinch had come to America in the twelfth century, over 300 years before Christopher Columbus. Hinde claimed that in 1799, the remains of six soldiers had been dug up near Jeffersonville, Indiana with breastplates containing Welsh coats of arms. In 1799, John Sevier, the first governor of Tennessee, also wrote of the alleged discovery of six skeletons in brass armor bearing Welsh coat-of-arms. Hinde claimed that M'Intosh recounted that American Indians and Welshmen living on the Mississippi River were conversing in Welsh in the late 1700s. In an 1842 letter Hinde stated, \\"I have just returned from the East, having visited the Atlantic cities generally for the first time, after forty-five years pioneering in the wilderness of the West. I have been three time a citizen of Kentucky, twice of Ohio, and twice of Illinois.\\" After returning from the visit, Hinde claimed that eastern ministers were unsuccessful because they underrated the people of the West. He said, A large collection of Hinde's diaries are held among the Lyman Draper Manuscripts in the Wisconsin Historical Society. In his diaries Hinde stated that he supported the Hollow Earth theory. Throughout his life Hinde maintained correspondence with many of the prominent men of the day. His correspondents included James Madison, George Madison, Thomas Jefferson, Henry Clay, Simon Kenton, Daniel Boone, and John Marshall. Death Hinde was sick a few days before dying from \\"winter fever.\\" Hinde is buried in Sandhill Cemetery in Mount Carmel next to his daughter Belinda and his second wife, Sarah Doughty Cavileer Neal. The wrought iron fence surrounding their graves was paid for by his son Charles in the early 1900s. Since he died at a relatively early age and his wife died shortly after him, his orphaned children were forced to live with other relatives or fend for themselves. Martha married Judge Charles H. Constable; together they looked after many of her younger siblings until they married or found work. Her brother Charles Hinde became a successful businessman and riverboat captain. One of Captain Hinde's accomplishments was investing in the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, California. Hinde's grandson, Frederick Zimmerman, built the Grand Rapids Hotel on the Hinde family farm in Mount Carmel near the Grand Rapids Dam and Hanging Rock. References              * Discusses Charles T.

The a porch is a polygon shape with three semicircular holes on pilasters. It is covered with a hemispherical dome with four circular holes to the interior which light the chapel. The entryway opens to the main town of Chiclana and Bay of C√°diz. It has Byzantine, Mozarabic, and Neoclassical features. Inside, it houses a small shrine. A sculpture representing Saint Anne with the Virgin sits within a niche, the work of the Genoese sculptor, Domingo Giscardi, who was based in Cadiz. The chapel is open to the public every Tuesday and July 26, the feast day of Santa Ana. References *Dionisio Montero Valenzuela, Cerro y Ermita de Santa Ana.

While it originally was a port, its lack of harbor and suitability for large cargo ships eventually shifted the economy to tourism in the 20th century. It is popular with people from Chiapas as it is located close to the state capital of Tuxtla Guti√©rrez as well as the regional city of Tonal√°. It is the most visited beach in Chiapas and one of its most popular tourist destinations, despite its relative lack of sophisticated tourism infrastructure. Puerto Arista is home of one of the state‚Äôs four marine turtle sanctuaries, design to help protect the various species which come here to lay their eggs. The community El Boulevard The community of Puerto Arista is located in the municipality of Tonal√°, twenty two km from the municipal seat and sixteen km off Federal Highway 200. The area is part of the Istmo-Costa region of the state, itself part of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. This coast area is a strip of land wedged between the Sierra Madre de Chiapas mountains and the Pacific Ocean . This area is mostly filled with small towns and ranches with extensive pasture for cattle, the main economic activity for this region. Some of the nearby communities include Cabeza de Toro, which straddles the road linking Puerta Arista and Boca del Cielo, both on the La Joya Lagoon. The community of Puerto Arista itself straddles a main boulevard that runs parallel to the beach. This road has various names such as Boulevard Zapotal and Avenida Mariano Matamoros, but it is most commonly referred to as El Boulevard. Most of the buildings along this boulevard, especially in the center of town, are business that cater to tourists, such as hotels, restaurants and small stores. The other important road is the Tonal√°-Puerto Arista highway, which connects to El Boulevard in the center of town, at the lighthouse built in the 19th century. Public transportation is limited to buses that go to Tonal√° and small vans and collective taxis to other locations. History Lighthouse in the center of town Originally called La Puerta, its existence is first recorded in 1813, when the Spanish council in C√°diz authorized the port to trade with Guatemala, other ports in New Spain and Peru. In the 1860s, President Benito Ju√°rez declared it a main port for coastal shipping. The port used to receive goods from Panama, Acapulco and as far as San Francisco. Chiapas products such as lime, dried fish, indigo and tropical hardwoods. As it lacks a bay, ships arriving to the area had to dock in open ocean, linked to the coast with a very long cable, with smaller boats to ferry cargo and passengers. In 1893, the federal government constructed a lighthouse to warn large cargo carriers from the area as its waters were not considered safe for such craft. Since then, the area has lost its function as a port, with only shrimp boats stopping nearby. The economy has shifted to tourism as Chiapas‚Äô most visited beach. In 2010, a large wave hit the area hitting beachside restaurants, washing away dozens of establishments and boats. The wave also eroded more than a meter of beach width in areas. In the summer and November 2011, there were some problems with high levels of Enterococcus bacteria in the water. Tourism Palapas on the beach Puerto Arista is located 195 km from the state capital of Tuxtla Gutierrez, making it a popular getaway for this city as well as Tonal√° along with Boca del Cielo fifteen km east. Although it is crowded mostly during Mexican vacation periods such as Holy Week and Christmas and empty most of the rest of the year, it is still the most visited beach area in the state. It is one of the most visited sites in Chiapas after Palenque, San Crist√≥bal de Las Casas and Chiapa de Corzo . The area received 90,371 total visits in 2008. During the Christmas vacation period in 2009, the port received about 2,000 visitors in two days, who spent about a million pesos with hotel occupancy at about eighty percent. In summer 2011, the average hotel occupancy was 46.38% with 17,000 visitors, up from 11,000 the year before. Puerto Arista has thirty two km of wide beaches facing open ocean. From the beach area, the peaks of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas can be seen in the background, which are often covered with clouds. The climate is hot and semi humid with most rain falling in the summer. The average annual temperature is 27C. These beaches have fine, gray, volcanic sand, flocks of frigatebirds visible. The surf can be heavy but this is not common. At low tide, the surf is gentler and safer for swimming. However, the most dangerous aspect about the water is riptides, capable of sweeping people out to sea. These mostly occur beyond the second line of wave breaks. There are no indications as to the safety of the waters and no professional lifeguards. In 2008, 27 of the 41 near drowning incidents in Chiapas occurred in Puerto Arista. Tourist infrastructure mostly consists of basic hotels and simple palapa restaurants which face the ocean. There are some upscale hotels up to three stars: Hotel Safari, Hotel Lucero, Aguamarina and Arista Bugambilias and one business offering bungalows Jos√©‚Äôs Camping and Caba√±as. The palapa restaurants all specialize in seafood dishes, all with very similar menus and prices. Although there are a couple of dozen of these restaurants, only five or six are generally open at any given time. On the main road near the lighthouse, there are food stand selling Mexican staples. ATV rentals are popular here but there is also boat rental, sports equipment and camping. The beach was the site of an event related to the NORCECA Beach Volleyball Circuit 2010. The Guerreros del Atl√©tico Chiapas professional soccer team used the area for training in 2011-2012. Puerto Arista turtle sanctuary Visitors at the sanctuary in 2011 Puerto Arista turtle sanctuary a state-sponsored turtle protection and preservation program, located 2.5 km west of town next to the Villa Murano Hotel. It is located on a property with 500 hectares of mangroves and beaches. It is one of four installations in the area along with those in Boca del Cielo, Costa Azul, and Barra de Zacapulco. Puerto Arista is one of the 144 beaches in Mexico where sea turtles come to lay eggs. It is also one of twenty two beaches where these nests of eggs experience a high risk of being pillaged. In addition, marine turtles have turned up dead on these shores, generally blamed on illegal fishing, especially shrimping, with nets in prohibited areas. There is still some illegal hunting of turtles and turtle eggs despite a federal ban. The sanctuary‚Äôs main function is to patrol the beach by foot and ATV for fresh turtle nests in order to relocate the eggs to protected enclosures. Later, the hatchlings are released back into the sea. It allows visitors to participate in both the collection of eggs and liberation of hatchlings. Activities take place year round but most turtles come here to nest between July and November. In 2008, the governor of Chiapas visited the sanctuary to participate in the liberation of over 7,000 hatchlings for the inauguration of the Centro Integral de Conservaci√≥n. In that year, about a half a million were released, with 25,000 visits. In 2010, the sanctuary was nearly abandoned with almost no personnel and deteriorated facilities. However, since then, there have been rehabilitation efforts.

They are defined as aspects of the mind that apprehend the quality of an object, and that have the ability to color the mind. Within the Abhidhamma, the mental factors are categorized as formations () concurrent with mind ().Guenther (1975), Kindle Location 321.Kunsang (2004), p. 23.Geshe Tashi Tsering (2006), Kindle Location 456. Alternate translations for mental factors include \\"mental states\\", \\"mental events\\", and \\"concomitants of consciousness\\". Introduction Mental factors are aspects of the mind that apprehend the quality of an object and have the ability to color the mind. Geshe Tashi Tsering explains: :The Tibetan for mental factors, semlay jungwa ch√∂ (Skt. chaitasika dharma), means phenomena arising from the mind, suggesting that the mental factors are not primary to the mind but arise within a larger framework. A mental factor, again, is defined as the aspect of the mind that apprehends a particular quality of an object. Because it is characterized by the qualities of activity and non-neutrality, it has the ability to color the mind in dependence on the way it manifests. Hence, a feeling of desire from seeing what is conceived as a beautiful object affects the other mental factors that are present at that time, and this colors the whole mind.Geshe Tashi Tsering (2006), Kindle Locations 564-568. The relationship between the main mind (Sanskrit: citta) and the mental factors can be described by the following metaphors: * The main mind is like screen in a cinema, and the mental factors are like the images projected on the screen. In this analogy, we typically do not notice the screen because we are so caught up on the images. * The main mind is like a king who sits passively on a throne, and the mental factors are like the king's busy ministers. Traleg Rinpoche states that the main distinction between the mind and mental factors is that the mind apprehends an object as a whole, whereas mental factors apprehend an object in its particulars.Traleg Rinpoche (1993). p. 59 Lists of mental factors Within Buddhism, there are many different systems of abhidharma (commonly referred to as Buddhist psychology), and each system contains its own list of the most significant mental factors. These lists vary from system to system both in the number of mental factors listed, and in the definitions that are given for each mental factor. These lists are not considered to be exhaustive; rather they present significant categories and mental factors that are useful to study in order to understand how the mind functions. Some of the main commentaries on the Abhidharma systems that are studied today include: * Abhidhammattha-sangaha by Acariya Anuruddha - a Theravada commentary that lists fifty-two mental factors. * AtthasƒÅlinƒ´ by Buddhaghosa - a Theravada commentary that provides explanations for fifty-two mental factors. * Abhidharmako≈õa by Vasubandhu - a Sarvastivada commentary (studied by the Mahayana schools) that lists forty-six mental factors. * Abhidharma-samuccaya by Asanga - a Yogachara commentary (studied by the Mahayana schools) that lists fifty-one mental factors. * Innermost Core of Topics of Knowledge (mDzod-phug) by Shenrab Miwo - a Tibetan Bon commentary that lists fifty-one factors. SthaviravƒÅda Sarvastivada tradition The Mahavibhasa and Abhidharmako≈õa have 46 mental factors which include: Ten mental factors The ten mahƒÅbh≈´mika dharmas are common to all consciousness. * VedanƒÅ - feeling * Sa·πÉj√±ƒÅ - perception * CetanƒÅ - volition * Spar≈õa - contact * Chanda - desire (to act) * Praj√±ƒÅ - wisdom * Sm·πõti - mindfulness * ManasikƒÅra - attention * Adhimok·π£a - decision * SamƒÅdhi - mental concentration. it also called Ekaggata, one-pointedness Ten wholesome mental factors The ten ku≈õala mahƒÅbh≈´mikƒÅ dharmƒÅ·∏• accompany the wholesome consciousnesses (kusala citta). * ≈öraddhƒÅ - faith * Vƒ´rya - energy * Hrƒ´ - shame at doing evil * ApatrƒÅpya - decorum, regard for consequence * Alobha - non-attachment * Adve·π£a - non-aggression * Pra≈õrabdhi - calmness * Upek·π£ƒÅ - equanimity * AppamƒÅda - conscientiousness * Ahi·πÉsƒÅ - non-injuriousness Six unwholesome mental factors The six kle≈õa mahƒÅbh≈´mika dharmƒÅ·∏• accompany kle≈õa. * Moha - delusion * PramƒÅda - heedlessness, carelessness, unconcern * Kau≈õƒ´dya - laziness, slothfulness * ƒÄ≈õraddhya - lack of faith, lack of trust * StyƒÅna - lethargy, gloominess * Auddhatya - excitement, ebullience TheravƒÅda Abhidhamma tradition Within the TheravƒÅda Abhidhamma tradition, the Abhidhammattha-sangaha enumerates the fifty-two mental factors listed below: Note that this list is not exhaustive; there are other mental factors mentioned in the Theravada teachings. This list identifies fifty-two important factors that help to understand how the mind functions. Seven universal mental factors The seven universal mental factors (sabbacittasƒÅdhƒÅra·πáa cetasikas) are common (sƒÅdhƒÅra·πáa) to all consciousness (sabbacitta). Bhikkhu Bodhi states: \\"These factors perform the most rudimentary and essential cognitive functions, without which consciousness of an object would be utterly impossible.\\" These seven factors are: * Phassa - contact * VedanƒÅ - feeling * Sa√±√±ƒÅ - perception * CetanƒÅ - volition * Ekaggata - one-pointedness * Jƒ´vitindriya - life faculty * ManasikƒÅra - attention Six occasional mental factors The six occasional or particular mental factors (paki·πá·πáaka cetasikas) are ethically variable mental factors found only in certain consciousnesses. They are: * Vitakka - Application of thought * VicƒÅra - Examining * Adhimokkha - Decision * Viriya - Energy * Pƒ´ti - Rapture * Chanda - Desire (to act) Fourteen unwholesome mental factors The unwholesome mental factors (akusala cetasikas) accompany the unwholesome consciousnesses (akusala citta). The fourteen unwholesome mental factors are: * Four universal unwholesome mental factors (akusalasƒÅdhƒÅra·πáa): ** Moha - delusion ** Ahirika - lack of shame ** Anottappa - disregard for consequence ** Uddhacca - restlessness * Three mental factors of the greed-group (lobha): ** Lobha - greed ** Di·π≠·π≠hi - wrong view ** MƒÅna - conceit * Four mental factors of the hatred-group (dosa) ** Dosa - hatred ** IssƒÅ - envy ** Macchariya - miserliness ** Kukkucca - regret * Other unwholesome mental factors ** Thƒ´na - sloth ** Middha - torpor ** VicikicchƒÅ - doubt Bhikkhu Bodhi states: :Unwholesome consciousness (akusalacitta) is consciousness accompanied by one or another of the three unwholesome roots‚Äîgreed, hatred, and delusion. Such consciousness is called unwholesome because it is mentally unhealthy, morally blameworthy, and productive of painful results. Twenty-five beautiful mental factors The beautiful mental factors (sobhana cetasikas) accompany the wholesome consciousnesses (kusala citta). The twenty-five beautiful mental factors (sobhana cetasikas) are: * Nineteen universal beautiful mental factors (sobhanasƒÅdhƒÅra·πáa): ** SaddhƒÅ - faith ** Sati - mindfulness ** Hiri - shame at doing evil ** Ottappa - regard for consequence ** Alobha - lack of greed ** Adosa - lack of hatred ** TatramajjhattatƒÅ - balance, neutrality of mind ** KƒÅyapassaddhi - tranquility of mental body ** Cittapassaddhi - tranquility of consciousness ** KƒÅyalahutƒÅ - lightness of mental body ** CittalahutƒÅ - lightness of consciousness ** KƒÅyamudutƒÅ - malleability/softness of mental body ** CittamudutƒÅ - malleability/softness of consciousness ** KƒÅyakamma√±√±atƒÅ - wieldiness of mental body ** Cittakamma√±√±atƒÅ - wieldiness of consciousness ** KƒÅyapƒÅgu√±√±atƒÅ - proficiency of mental body ** CittapƒÅgu√±√±atƒÅ - proficiency of consciousness ** KƒÅyujukatƒÅ - straightness/rectitude of mental body ** CittujukatƒÅ - straightness/rectitude of consciousness * Three Abstinences (virati): ** SammƒÅvƒÅcƒÅ - right speech ** SammƒÅkammanta - right action ** SammƒÅ-ƒÅjƒ´va - right livelihood * Two Immeasurables (appama√±√±a): ** Karu·πáƒÅ - compassion ** Mudita - sympathetic joy * One Faculty of wisdom (pa√±√±indriya): ** Pa√±√±ƒÅ - wisdom Bhikkhu Bodhi states: :Wholesome consciousness (kusalacitta) is consciousness accompanied by the wholesome roots‚Äînon-greed or generosity, non-hatred or loving-kindness, and non-delusion or wisdom. Such consciousness is mentally healthy, morally blameless, and productive of pleasant results. Mahayana Abhidharma tradition Abhidharma studies in the Mahayana tradition are based on the Sanskrit SarvƒÅstivƒÅda abhidharma system. Within this system, the Abhidharma-samuccaya identifies fifty-one mental factors: Five universal mental factors  The five universal mental factors (sarvatraga) are: # Spar≈õa - contact, contacting awareness, sense impression, touch # VedanƒÅ - feeling, sensation # Sa·πÉj√±ƒÅ - perception # CetanƒÅ - volition, intention # ManasikƒÅra - attention These five mental factors are referred to as universal or omnipresent because they operate in the wake of every mind situation. If any one of these factors is missing, then the experience of the object is incomplete. For example: * If there is no spar≈õa (contact), then there would be no basis for perception. * If there is no vedana (feeling, sensation), there is no relishing of the object. * If there is no sa·πÉj√±ƒÅ (perception), then the specific characteristic of the object is not perceived. * If there is no cetanƒÅ (volition), then there is no movement towards and settling on the object. * If there is no manasikƒÅra (attention), then there is not holding onto the object.Guenther (1975), Kindle Location 409-414.  Five object-determining mental factors  The five object-determining mental factors (vi·π£ayaniyata) are: # Chanda - desire (to act), intention, interest # Adhimok·π£a - decision, interest, firm conviction # Sm·πõti - mindfulness # Praj√±ƒÅ - wisdom # SamƒÅdhi - concentration The five factors are referred to as object- determining is because these factors each grasp the specification of the object. When they are steady, there is certainty concerning each object.Guenther (1975), Kindle Location 487-488. Eleven virtuous mental factors The eleven virtuous (ku≈õala) mental factors are: # SraddhƒÅ - faith # Hrƒ´ - self-respect, conscientiousness, sense of shame # ApatrƒÅpya - decorum, regard for consequence # Alobha - non-attachment # Adve·π£a - non-aggression, equanimity, lack of hatred # Amoha - non-bewilderment # Vƒ´rya - diligence, effort # Pra≈õrabdhi - pliancy # ApramƒÅda - conscientiousness # Upek·π£a - equanimity # Ahi·πÉsƒÅ - nonharmfulness Six root unwholesome factors The six root unwholesome factors (m≈´lakle≈õa) are: # RƒÅga - attachment # Pratigha - anger # Avidya - ignorance # MƒÅna - pride, conceit # Vicikitsa - doubt # D·πõ·π£·π≠i - wrong view Twenty secondary unwholesome factors  The twenty secondary unwholesome factors (upakle≈õa) are: #Krodha - rage, fury #UpanƒÅha - resentment #Mrak≈õa - concealment, slyness-concealment #PradƒÅ≈õa - spitefulness #ƒ™r·π£yƒÅ - envy, jealousy #MƒÅtsarya - stinginess, avarice, miserliness #MƒÅyƒÅ - pretense, deceit #AsƒÅ·π≠hya - hypocrisy, dishonesty #Mada - self-infatuation, mental inflation, self-satisfaction #Vihi·πÉsƒÅ - malice, hostility, cruelty, intention to harm #ƒÄhrƒ´kya - lack of shame, lack of conscience, shamelessness #AnapatrƒÅpya - lack of propriety, disregard, shamelessness #StyƒÅna - lethargy, gloominess #Auddhatya - excitement, ebullience #ƒÄ≈õraddhya - lack of faith, lack of trust #Kau≈õƒ´dya - laziness, slothfulness #PramƒÅda - heedlessness, carelessness, unconcern #Mu·π£itasm·πõtitƒÅ - forgetfulness #Asa·πÉprajanya - non- alertness, inattentiveness #Vik·π£epa - distraction, desultoriness Four changeable mental factors  The four changeable mental factors (aniyata) are: #Kauk·πõitya - regret, worry, #Middha - sleep, drowsiness #Vitarka - conception, selectiveness, examination #VicƒÅra - discernment, discursiveness, analysis Alternate translations Alternate translations for the term mental factors (Sanskrit: caitasika) include: * Mental factors (Geshe Tashi Tsering, Jeffrey Hopkins, Bhikkhu Bodhi, N.K.G.

Happy Eyeballs is designed to address the problem that many IPv6 networks are unreachable from parts of the Internet, and applications trying to reach those networks will appear unresponsive, thus frustrating users. Happy Eyeballs solves this problem by determining which transport would be better used for a particular connection by trying them both in parallel. The algorithm and its requirements are described in RFC 8305, \\"Happy Eyeballs Version 2: Better Connectivity Using Concurrency\\". The name \\"happy eyeballs\\" derives from the term \\"eyeball\\" to describe endpoints which represent human Internet end-users, as opposed to servers. An application that uses a Happy Eyeballs algorithm checks both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity (with a preference for IPv6) and uses the first connection that is returned. The addresses are often chosen from the DNS with a round-robin algorithm. Implementations of Happy Eyeballs stacks exist in Google's Chrome web browser, Opera 12.10, Firefox version 13, OS X,OS X El Capitan implementation is biased towards ipv6 with a 25 ms headstart, previously from OS X Lion to OS X Yosemite it used the fastest connection with no protocol preference, according to cURL and OpenBSD.

His brother was the actor and director Lloyd Reckord, with whom he sometimes worked. Early years and education Barrington John Reckord was born in Kingston, Jamaica, where he grew up in Vineyard Town with his three siblings: two brothers, Carol and Lloyd, and a sister Cynthia. He attended Kingston College and after matriculation went on to study theology at St Peter's College in 1948. He left the island in 1950 after winning an Issa Scholarship to Cambridge University, where he read for a degree at Emmanuel College, graduating in 1953. Writing career He began writing plays as a student and several of them were performed at London's Royal Court Theatre (he is claimed as the first Black Briton to have had a play on there),Vanessa Thorpe, \\"After a century of black British theatre, actors still struggle to take centre stage\\", The Observer, 25 October 2015. sometimes directed by his brother Lloyd Reckord.Michael Reckord, \\"Theatre Veteran Lloyd Reckord Passes\\", The Gleaner, 11 July 2015. Della, Barry Reckord's first play, which (as Adella) had been staged by his brother in a small fringe production in 1954, was produced under the title Flesh to a Tiger at the Royal Court in 1958, directed by Tony Richardson, with a cast that featured Cleo Laine, Pearl Prescod, Nadia Cattouse, Johnny Sekka and Lloyd Reckord, and choreography by Boscoe Holder.\\"Flesh to a Tiger\\", Black Plays Archive, National Theatre. The play dealt with the attempts by a cult leader to enforce his wishes on a female member of his congregation.Arthur Holmberg, Carlos Solorzano, World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theatre: Volume 2: The Americas, Routledge, 2014, p. 189. In 1961 the Royal Court also produced You in Your Small Corner, which transferred to the New Arts Theatre and was subsequently adapted for ITV's Play of the Week series in an episode that aired on 5 June 1962, directed by Claude Whatham.\\"You in Your Small Corner\\" (ITV Play of the Week, Season 7 Episode 21), IMDb.Eleni Liarou, \\"You in Your Small Corner (1962)\\", BFI Screen Online. This broadcast is now thought to contain the first interracial kiss on television between Lloyd Reckord, the playwright's brother, and Elizabeth MacLennan.Stuart Black, \\"World‚Äôs First Interracial TV Kiss Was In Brixton\\", Londonist, 20 November 2015. Reckord's most successful play Skyvers, first produced in 1963 at the Royal Court (directed by Ann Jellicoe, with an all-white cast that included David Hemmings), is considered by Guardian critic Michael Billington to be \\"one of the key plays of the 1960s\\", prefiguring Edward Bond's 1965 Saved. Skyvers, which deals with the alienation of a group of working-class south London boys in the last few days at their comprehensive school, was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 in November 2012 as part of a series of plays curated by Kwame Kwei- Armah,\\"Skyvers by Barry Reckord\\", Drama on 3, BBC Radio 3, 18 November 2012. after lobbying to ensure better recognition for black dramatists.Elizabeth Pears, \\"Fond Farewell To Trio Who Helped Shape Black Britain\\", The Voice, 24 January 2012. Reckord wrote other television dramas, including for the BBC In the Beautiful Caribbean (1972) and Club Havana (1975), as well as a book about Cuba entitled Does Fidel Eat More Than Your Father (Praeger, 1971). In 1973 he received a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship to Assist Research and Artistic Creation.\\"Biography - Barry Reckord\\". Extract from Marjorie H. Morgan, Caribbean Britain: The Cultural and Biographical Directory, via Historical Geographies, 7 February 2012. Also in 1973, Reckord was awarded the Silver Musgrave Medal by the Institute of Jamaica. Final years Reckord spent most of his adult life in Britain, for more than four decades with his companion Diana Athill, who in her memoirs has written candidly about their unconventional relationship, both as lovers and friends.Diana Athill, \\"A final farewell to sex\\", The Guardian, 22 December 2007.Sarah Lyall, \\"In Life‚Äôs Latest Chapter, Feeling Free Again\\", The New York Times, 10 October 2010.Mick Brown, \\"Diana Athill on letters, lovers & letting go\\", The Telegraph, 23 September 2011.Allan Fallow, \\"‚ÄòAlive, Alive Oh!‚Äô: At 98, Diana Athill is still far from the end of her story\\", The Washington Post, 26 February 2016. When in the 1970s he decided to produce his new play White Witch in Jamaica, the central role was won by a young woman named Sally Cary, a farmer's daughter from Somerset, who began an intimate involvement with the playwright that continued on their return to London, leading Athill to conclude: \\"since she was spending almost every night in Barry's bed, keeping her bedsitter was a waste of money, so I suggested that she move in with us.... When Sally joined us what I felt was that I now had a lovely new friend in the house, as well as a darling old one, and the next two years or so were some of the happiest I can remember.\\"Diana Athill, Life Class: The Selected Memoirs of Diana Athill, Granta Books, 2009, pp. 604‚Äì606.Diana Athill, \\"Living with Barry and Sally\\", Web of Stories. In the last few years of his life Reckord suffered from ill health, eventually moving back to Jamaica to live with family.Charles-Adam Foster-Simard, \\"Instead of a Review: On Reading Diana Athill\\", The Millions, 25 May 2016. He died on the island in Boscobel, Saint Mary Parish, in December 2011, aged 85. In accordance with his wishes, his body was donated to the University of the West Indies for medical research.

Due to his large land holdings and expertise in farming, Zimmerman became a notable farmer, breeder, and real estate entrepreneur. Zimmerman's farm, originally purchased by his grandfather Thomas S. Hinde from the federal government in 1815, included the Grand Rapids Dam, Hanging Rock, and Buttercrust. His first experience running a business was in 1883 when he ran a grocery store in Fort Smith, Arkansas with his cousin Harry Hinde. Many of his businesses centered on his family farm, but in later years Zimmerman achieved success through his ownership and investment in mines, banks, and real estate. He also owned or invested in the Hanging Rock and Grand Rapids Dam Farm Company, the Grand Rapids Hotel Park Company, and the Wabash Bull-Frog Mines Company. Zimmerman was among the fourth generation of the Hinde family in the United States that was begun by his great-grandfather Dr. Thomas Hinde. His grandfather Thomas S. Hinde was a prominent politician and Methodist minister who contributed to the development of Illinois, Indiana, and the spread of the Methodist faith. His father Jacob Zimmerman held various political offices in the state of Illinois and in his early years owned several prominent Democratic newspapers in Ohio and Illinois right before the Civil War. At the age of one, Zimmerman's mother died and he was sent to live with family in Ohio and did not see his father again until he was fourteen. Towards the end of his life, Zimmerman was elected to various positions of leadership in the Knights of Pythias and Illinois Farmers Institute. He was elected secretary of the Illinois Farmers Institute for multiple terms. During Zimmerman's life he managed banks, his family farm in Mount Carmel Precinct, Wabash County, Illinois, the Grand Rapids Hotel near the Grand Rapids Dam, and invested in numerous business ventures. The Grand Rapids Hotel was one of his most notable accomplishments and soon after opening in 1922 attracted tourists from across the nation. The hotel was one of the largest resorts in the Wabash Valley and at one time had fishing, trap shoots, baseball, golf, boating, swimming, a restaurant, and other recreational activities. The hotel promoted the growth of the region by increasing the number of tourists and by hosting large-scale meetings and public events like celebrations at Hallowe'en, Christmas, and the Fourth of July. He died from complications of a broken hip that he suffered near the Grand Rapids Hotel in 1924 after falling out of his Model T automobile. Five years after Zimmerman died, the hotel was burned to the ground - in 1929 the hotel's manager, Glenn Goodart, caused a fire by dropping a blowtorch in the basement. The hotel was not rebuilt due to a lack of funds and the onset of the Great Depression. Early years Frederick Hinde Zimmerman was born on his family farm in the Mount Carmel Precinct, Wabash County, Illinois on October 17, 1864. He was the second child of the Honorable Jacob Zimmerman, an Illinois congressman and politician from a wealthy family, and Belinda Hinde, a member of the prominent Hinde family and the daughter of Rev. Thomas S. Hinde, the founder of Mount Carmel. His parents met and were married in Marshall, Illinois while his father ran a newspaper and his mother lived with her sister Martha Hinde and her husband Judge Charles H. Constable. During the Civil War, Zimmerman's father and uncles grew tobacco and operated mills on their family's farm, a portion of which was located on the Wabash River and included Hanging Rock, Buttercrust (a natural sandbar on the Wabash River), and the Grand Rapids Dam. His mother's family were large landowners in Mount Carmel and Wabash County, and the majority of the land had been purchased by Thomas S. Hinde in 1815 from the federal government. Originally, the family farm had belonged to Zimmerman's mother and her siblings, but his father purchased their interests. Zimmerman's father was able to purchase the Hinde farm because he had become wealthy through his ownership of various newspapers in the preceding years. His father lived on the farm near the Grand Rapids Dam from 1860 until moving to a 160-acre farm in the southwestern part of Friendsville, Illinois in 1903. When Zimmerman was one year old, his mother died and his father sent him to live with family in Ohio. His father owned newspapers in Marshall, Illinois, and in Mount Carmel, Illinois, but by the time Zimmerman was born, he had retired from the newspaper business to focus on running the Hinde family farm and on politics. Based on an entry in Edmund C. Hinde's diaries, Zimmerman's uncle, judge Charles H. Constable, and then his mother died from morphine overdoses that may have resulted from an addiction to the drug developed during the Civil War. Shortly after the death of his mother Belinda, Zimmerman's older brother Charles died at the age of four in Wabash County, Illinois. Zimmerman stayed with his father's sisters in Ohio on a farm that his grandfather Henry Zimmerman had purchased from the Wyandot Indians in the 1840s, until his father remarried (to Emma Harris) in 1875. His father was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1878 and served two full terms until 1882. In 1879 Frederick returned to the family farm in Wabash County, Illinois to live with his father and stepmother. Zimmerman graduated from high school in Mount Carmel, Illinois, and then worked on the family farm near the Grand Rapids Dam until 1883, where he oversaw the farming operations and raised livestock. During his youth, Zimmerman was commonly called \\"Freddie\\" or \\"Freddie boy\\" by his family and close friends. In 1883, at age nineteen, Zimmerman and his cousin Harry Hinde were invited by Zimmerman's uncle Edmund C. Hinde to move to Fort Smith, Arkansas, where Hinde lived following his return from the California Gold Rush. After moving to Fort Smith, they owned and operated a grocery store from 1883 to 1886. Judge Isaac Parker at this time was in the process of eradicating the brothels, saloons, and outlaws that had taken over Fort Smith through increased public hangings and stiffer criminal penalties and this general lawless environment made operation of the grocery store difficult. This period in the history of Fort Smith has been memorialized in the novel True Grit, and the two movies it inspired, True Grit (1969) and True Grit (2010). The grocery store was unsuccessful, and they sold the business. Zimmerman returned to Mount Carmel, Illinois, but he remained close to his cousin, who later was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives, operated several businesses, and speculated in real estate. In later years, along with their uncle Charles T. Hinde, they invested in real estate and mines in New Mexico. The New Mexico properties only returned modest profits but were kept in the family until the 1950s. Family and farming Peter Jacob Hinde Zimmerman, Fred Zimmerman's son After closing the grocery store in Arkansas in 1886, Zimmerman returned to the family farm and became a gentleman farmer. After Zimmerman returned, his father gave a small acreage of the Hinde farm to Zimmerman's half brother John H. Zimmerman, who raised pigs and farmed the acreage until he sold the property to Zimmerman several years later. Zimmerman was given title to the Hinde family farm by his father on July 13, 1902 after he married Agnes Oldendorf (1872‚Äì1922). Agnes was the daughter of Peter and Mary S. Oldendorf who ran a music business and were retail liquor dealers in Mount Carmel. The brother of Zimmerman's wife, Charles Oldendorf, who served as mayor of Mount Carmel, Illinois during the late 1890s, encouraged Zimmerman to join the fraternal organization the Knights of Pythias. In 1906, Zimmerman became chancellor commander of the Knights of Pythias lodge in Wabash County, Illinois and was a Captain in the uniform rank of the order. After receiving title to the Hinde family farm in 1902, Zimmerman built a house near the Grand Rapids Dam. Once construction of the new home was completed, Zimmerman used two horse teams and numerous men to lift his father's old home near the river and move it to higher ground closer to his new house. The couple had two children, Rebecca Zimmerman in 1901 and Peter Jacob Hinde Zimmerman in 1903. Zimmerman and his wife raised their children in the Methodist faith and they attended school in Mount Carmel. From his son's early years Zimmerman trained him to operate the farm and livestock. His son won many awards in livestock shows. Following Zimmerman's death in 1924, ownership of the Grand Rapids Hotel was divided equally between his children. They owned the hotel until it burned in 1929. In 1901, Zimmerman was elected secretary of the Illinois Farmers' Institute, a position he held for three years. His father also held leadership positions with the Illinois Farmers' Institute and frequently gave speeches on good farming practices, the origin of soils, the road system, and climatic influence on plants. Meetings during his tenure as secretary averaged 350 participating members and a yearlong membership in 1901 cost $71.99. The district director stated that during the tenure of Zimmerman and the other officers they made the institute, \\"...look very attractive after they fixed it up with flags and bunting.\\" At this time the institute members and Zimmerman were followers of the Grangers Movement, which put emphasis on families to band together to promote the economic and political well-being of the community and agriculture. Zimmerman was known for raising some of the finest trotting horses in Southern Illinois, and many of his horses were noted for their dressage ability. Zimmerman also operated a successful livestock operation that focused on raising specialty hogs and cattle. He was noted nationally as a breeder and owner of Holstein- Friesian cows by the Holstein-Friesian Association of America. Three of his Holstein cows (Netherland Gem Segis, Kosa Beat Segis, and Vickery de Kol Korndyke) were listed among the best known of the breed in herd and pedigree listings. For a short time Zimmerman and his father raised registered Shropshire sheep primarily for meat, at the family farm near the Grand Rapids Dam. Some of their Shropshire sheep were listed on the American Shropshire Registry, which was a national register for the highest quality sheep of the breed. Zimmerman's son lived on the family farm his entire life and in later years was elected to various public offices in Wabash County Illinois. Like his father, he continued the tradition of raising specialty hogs and cattle. Both men continually expanded the family land holdings and diversified the farming operations. Later business ventures In the early 1900s Zimmerman began to invest in other business ventures and strengthen his relationship with his uncle Captain Charles T. Hinde who at that time was living in Coronado, California, and was vice president of the Speckels Brothers Commercial Company in San Diego. Some of Zimmerman's more notable businesses were a coal mine in Indiana, a few mines in the western United States, and a company he co-owned, the Wabash Bull-Frog Mines Company in Nevada and Arizona, which he began investing in from August 1905. Zimmerman's father owned many coal mines in Illinois and Indiana, so in his later years, Zimmerman also invested in some of them. Zimmerman also served on the board of directors of multiple banks in the Midwest, and owned a substantial interest in The First National Bank in Mount Carmel, Illinois. Zimmerman's primary business at this time was his management of the Grand Rapids Dam and Hanging Rock Farms Company, which was organized to manage the farming operations of the family farm and the increasing number of tourists visiting its Grand Rapids Dam and Hanging Rock sections. The Grand Rapids Dam created favorable fishing conditions, which attracted large numbers of people. Zimmerman also opened a small shop near the dam that sold goods and fishing equipment to tourists, rented boats, and conducted tours. Nick Garrett, originally a hired hand on the Zimmerman farm, managed the store for the Zimmerman family. Grand Rapids Hotel The Grand Rapids Hotel, as it appeared in 1922 Zimmerman's uncle Captain Charles T. Hinde, a shipping magnate who played an important role in the development of Southern California through his various investments with John D. Spreckels and E. S. Babcock, mentored Zimmerman in business strategies. Specifically, Zimmerman and Hinde discussed the Hotel del Coronado investment, which Hinde had contributed to in the late 1880s. Over the years Zimmerman often traveled to Coronado, California to visit Hinde. When Charles T. Hinde died in 1915, he left Zimmerman and Harry Hinde a substantial portion of his estate. Adjusting for inflation, Zimmerman inherited millions from the estate. After the estate was settled in 1917, Zimmerman decided to use his portion of the money to establish a hotel and resort on the Hinde family farm next to the Grand Rapids Dam; before he could start, he had to wait for the conclusion of World War I. Construction of the hotel likely began sometime in 1919 or 1920 and continued until the hotel was completed on August 7, 1922. A few months after the opening of the hotel, Zimmerman's wife, Agnes, died. The hotel, which was easy to access due to the railroad and Wabash River, was an immediate success and attracted people from across the country. It was advertised in many of the leading national newspapers, and eventually expanded into a full resort with golf, baseball, trap shoots, boating, and many other activities. Zimmerman chose O.L. Rapson, who had worked at the family farm and lived in a small house next to his, as The Grand Rapids Hotel's first manager. He was fired in 1924 after the sudden death of Zimmerman and replaced by Rapson's friend Glenn Goodart at the request of Zimmerman's children. In 1929, Goodart burned the hotel to the ground by dropping a blowtorch in its basement shop; it was not rebuilt due to the onset of the Great Depression and a lack of available funds. Death A few weeks before Zimmerman's death in 1924, he suffered a stroke. He died after an eventful day at the annual fair in Mount Carmel as he was returning to his farm at the Grand Rapids Dam on September 21, 1924. Before returning to his residence, Zimmerman, with his children, stopped by the Grand Rapids Hotel to check on the daily business. As he exited the car driven by his son, he fell and broke his hip. Even though he was treated for his injuries by Dr. G.S. Couch, Zimmerman died the next day. According to his obituary, Zimmerman died of \\"hardening of the arteries.\\" In his will, he left about seventy-five percent of his estate to his son and about twenty-five percent to his daughter. Some of the stock in The First National Bank in Mount Carmel that Zimmerman left to his daughter caused her financial hardships due to the bank's failure during the Great Depression. Burial site Zimmerman is buried at Rose Hill Cemetery in Mount Carmel, Illinois, next to his father Jacob Zimmerman, his wife Agnes Zimmerman, and his longtime friend and farm hand Nick Garrett.

It was built in 1907 and added to the National Register in 2006. History Cass City's First Presbyterian Church was organized in 1877, and initially held services in a small one-room schoolhouse. However, by March 1878 enough funds had been raised to begin work on a new building, located at this site. The new building, a wooden Gothic Revival structure, was dedicated in October 1878. In 1906, the original building was enlarged and reconstructed to make the church in its present form. The 1878 building was raised slightly and a basement constructed underneath, and the frame and roof structure was retained to serve as the basis for the new church's rear section. A new front section and bell tower were constructed at the same time, and the new church was dedicated in early 1907. Around the same time, the church purchased an 1865 Henry Erben tracker organ, originally built for the First Presbyterian Church of Pontiac. The church building continues to serve as the home of the First Presbyterian Church. Updates and restoration of the building have occurred in the 2000s. Description The First Presbyterian Church is a T-shaped, cross-gable-roof auditorium church with a square-plan tower. Window openings are a combination of round and pointed-arch styles. The basement is largely above ground level, and is faced with brownish rock-face concrete block, while the upper portion is faced with buff-hued brick. The entrance is through the tower, at the head or a flight of stairs. On the interior, a small narthex is in the tower, and a set of double doors lead to the auditorium. The floor of the auditorium slopes gently. The curved pews are set into three sections separated by aisles, ad facing a raised pulpit in one corner. A broad opening leads to a separate room, known as the annex. A series of stained and art glass windows installed as part of the 1906-07 reconstruction are installed in the windows.

It was intended to follow on from the Type 42 but armed with the Sea Dart Mark II missile. The primary role of the Type 43 was to protect a task force from air- launched missile attack. There were two proposed variants - the small variant and the large variant. The project advanced to feasibility design before being cancelled in 1981. Small Variant The design for the small variant Type 43 resembled a Type 42 with one twin Sea Dart launcher forward and directors fore and aft. Large Variant The design for the large variant Type 43 had twin Sea Dart launchers both forward and aft with four radar directors. Also, two GWS.25 Seawolf launchers were located forward and aft. With launchers at both ends the flight deck was relocated midships between the two superstructure blocks. The helicopter hangar would have room for one Merlin or two Lynx helicopters.

(2009), Systematic Classification of Recent and Fossil Conoidean Gastropods, ConchBooks, Hankenheim, Germany, 295 pp. * Genus Conus sensu stricto Linnaeus, 1758 :: Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The basic shell shape is conical to elongated conical, has a deep anal notch on the shoulder, a smooth periostracum and a small operculum. The shoulder of the shell is usually nodulose and the protoconch is usually multispiral. Markings often include the presence of tents except for black or white color variants, with the absence of spiral lines of minute tents and textile bars. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The radula has an elongated anterior section with serrations and a large exposed terminating cusp, a non-obvious waist, blade is either small or absent and has a short barb, and lacks a basal spur. ::Geographical distribution :::These species are found in the Indo- Pacific region. ::Feeding habits :::These species eat other gastropods including cones. * Subgenus Lamniconus da Motta, 1991 ::Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The shell is turbinate to elongate conical in shape. The protoconch is paucispiral. The spire is scalariform and concave in cross section. The shell is ornamented with cords and nodules which die out early in the postnuclear whorls. The anal notch is deep. The periostracum is tufted, and the operculum is small. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The anterior section of the radular tooth is roughly equal in length with the posterior section, the blade is long and covers most of the anterior section. A basal spur is present, and the barb is short. The radular tooth has serrations, and an internal terminating cusp. ::Geographical distribution :::The species in this genus occur in the occur in the West Atlantic region. ::Feeding habits :::These cone snails are presumed to be vermivorous, meaning that the cones prey on polychaete worms, based upon the radular tooth morphology.

DADT had banned the service of openly gay members in the United States Armed Forces and Phillips used YouTube, under the alias \\"AreYouSuprised\\", to anonymously seek support and to document his life under the policy over several months. His videos included his coming out to his father and mother, which coincided with Phillips showing his face for the first time, and the accidental discovery of his anonymous web presence by his co-workers.

At the time, the U.S. military permitted homosexuals to serve in its ranks under its \\"Don't ask, don't tell\\" policy established in 1993, which limited service by homosexuals to those who did not reveal their sexual orientation. A statute repealing the DADT policy was enacted in December 2010, with the change in policy delayed until military and government officials certified that plans were in place for its smooth implementation.Stars and Stripes: Leo Shane III, \\"After historic vote, focus shifts to implementing plan to let gays serve openly,\\" December 19, 2010, accessed January 11, 2012 The date when homosexuals could serve openly in the military remained uncertain and Congressional efforts to prevent the change in policy from going into effect continued during the spring of 2011.Stars and Stripes: \\"House panel votes to delay repeal of 'don't ask, don't tell',\\" May 12, 2011, accessed January 11, 2012; Stars and Stripes: Leo Shane III, \\"Lawmakers want Obama to halt DADT repeal,\\" June 16, 2011, accessed January 11, 2012 Social media campaign While deployed in Southwest Asia in April 2011, Phillips, a Senior Airman since March 15, became determined to reveal his homosexuality.

Popkin counts sixteen videos, but only thirteen included Phillips, while three others recorded music performances. he asked the public for advice and encouragement. The motivation behind his social media campaign was to build support to help in his coming out, he himself describing it as \\"selfish\\". Another motivation was to share his experience so that other closeted homosexuals could learn from it. In his YouTube and Twitter postings, he revealed only general details about his identity and filmed himself so that only his headless torso could be seen. He gave varying estimates of the time he thought it would take to complete his disclosure process, at one point announcing his determination to come out to his family by the end of 2012. Southwest Asia postings In his initial video posted from an undisclosed location in Southwest AsiaU.S. military personnel are sometimes forbidden to reveal their location when deployed. For example, see Sun-Times: \\"Colonel named professional of the year,\\" January 5, 2012, accessed January 13, 2012; Wired: Noah Schachtman, \\"Air Force Cargo Crew Delivers, Afghan War Continues,\\" August 19, 2009, accessed January 13, 2012 on April 18, he said it \\"may take a year or so for this to finally get over with\\", described himself as \\"one hundred percent closeted\\" and said: \\"The whole point of this video is to come out.

When posted to Europe in 2010, he discovered that homosexuality in Germany was \\"completely different than America...more accepted\\" and that changed his view of himself: \\"when you see things...and you kinda see where you fit into society.\\" He struggled to describe his self-acceptance, noting that choosing to be heterosexual would be \\"easier all the way around\\" while homosexuality meant \\"going against the grain.\\" He noted negative attitudes toward homosexuality in the area where he grew up and in the military, but ended his account: \\"It's not a choice. It's the way I was born and it's a big stumbling block.\\" His concerns focused on his parents' reaction: \\"I wish this wasn't something that wasn't expected of me. I wish I went along with what my parents planned for me, and what they thought I would develop into, and it's not.\\"Washington Post: \\"Ed O'Keefe, \\"Don't ask, don't tell: Who is Randy Phillips?,\\" September 21, 2011, accessed January 9, 2012 Phillips used secluded locations for several of the videos he posted from Southwest Asia, including a bunker and the inside of a bus. He taped others outdoors and kept looking left and right to make sure no one else was coming within earshot. Discussing the repeal of DADT in the context of the American civil rights movement, Phillips said repeal of DADT was \\"a huge move in American civil rights and...there have been bigger things like abolishing slavery, giving women the right to vote, getting rid of segregation, and those have all been great, but this is huge for our generation.\\" He reported another closeted airman's fear of disclosing his sexual orientation, and recounted his own repeated failures to follow through on self-imposed deadlines to come out to a friend. He discussed his YouTube postings with another closeted serviceman, though in his later remarks Phillips never counted their shared knowledge of each other's homosexuality as part of his coming out in the military. Prompted by that serviceman's questions, he allowed that his use of social media might represent a \\"subconscious\\" attempt to allow others to discover his sexuality on their own and spare him the decision to come out. Phillips turned twenty-one early in May and on May 25, he posted a video report on the training session he attended about the repeal of DADT, writing in a Twitter message: \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell training was this morning. It was a great presentation that nobody listened to.\\" On June 5, he reported via video that he had come out to a member of the military in late May. After reacting disrespectfully to the casual use of the word \\"faggot\\" in his work group, he apologized the next day in private to his immediate supervisor in the Air Force and told him that he was gay. Later he wrote on Twitter: \\"It has been kinda awkward since I told my boss, but he has only called me faggot about twice since.\\" On July 7 he came out to a friend and fellow airman who reacted positively. Phillips posted a video of the conversation immediately, though he did not tell the friend his response was publicly available on YouTube for another month.Stars and Stripes: Geoff Ziezulewicz, \\"'Dad, I'm gay.

On August 12, Phillips posted three videos of a band that visited his deployment and performed for a small group of military service members. These videos received more than 17,000 views overnight, a level of activity far in excess of the several hundred views Phillips' postings were attracting.

Aranjanam can also fasten the cloth on the waist, similar to women using it to secure the folds of a sari. It is possible that some parents also believe that it will safeguard against evil spirits.

During the ceremony, charadu (thread), one in black cotton and the other a chain in gold are intertwined and tied around the waist of the child - this is usually done by the father of the child. This thread is called 'Aranjanam'. The child's eyes are lined with mayye or kanmashi (Kohl). A black spot is placed on one cheek or asymmetrically on the forehead, to ward off the evil eyes. The father whispers the chosen Hindu name in the child's right ear three times while the left ear is covered with a betel leaf. This is then repeated with the left ear. A mixture of ghee (melted and clarified butter) and honey is given to the infant as a base for its various foods in the future.

He was born in Rio de Janeiro. In 1931 D√©mosthenes succeeded Fernando Giudicelli - who went on to play for FC Torino, being one of the first Brazilian footballers pursuing a career as professional in Europe - in the mid-field of Fluminense FC in Rio de Janeiro. On a visit to Rio in 1932 Giudicelli convinced D√©mosthenes to join him on the way back to Italy to play professionally too. As those days only people with Italian background, so-called Oriundi, were permitted to do so he changed his name to the more Italian sounding Demostene Bertini.M√°rio Filho: O negro no futebol brasileiro, 1947, p. 183. Filho used D√©mosthenes as an example, that Brazilian players would rather give up their names than their nationality. Fausto dos Santos and Jaguar√© Bezerra de Vasconcelos only a few years before rather abandoned a well remunerated engagement with FC Barcelona, than to give in on demands for their naturalisation. Thus, in the season 1932/33 he played together with Giudicelli in Turin. The technically gifted player had an excellent start, but soon run into difficulties with regards to defending his claim to Italian origin, which caused him to be sidelined for some time. After this, he found it difficult to live up to his potential, and frequently was left out of the starting line-up. Until the end of the season 1933/34 he run up 30 matches for Torino which finished 7th and 12th in those years. After that he was transferred to Sampierdarenese of Genova where he became part of their standard line-up and played in 28 league matches, finishing the season 13th.

The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. History The Trinity Episcopal Church congregation was organized in 1871. The congregation held services intermittently, and it was not until 1877 that they were organized and had regular services and a pastor. The congregation began planning to build this church in 1880.Marcia M. Dievendorf, Patricia E. Frazer, & Mark O. Keller, The Caro Area (Arcadia, 2011), p. 66. Construction began in 1881, and the church was completed before Christmas. The church thrived for many years, but in the 1920s the Episcopal congregation dwindled, and the church disbanded in 1929. The building was sold in 1934 to the Church of the Nazarene, which had been founded in 1916. This congregation occupied the church until 1974, when they constructed a new church. The village or Caro planned to demolish the church. However, preservationists saved the church from demolition.Michigan Historical Marker: Trinity Episcopal Church (Caro) The building was later acquired by the City of Caro and as of 2017 was used by the Thumb Area Center for the Arts. The building was in need of repair, and its future is uncertain. Description Trinity Episcopal Church is a Gothic Revival frame church on a stone foundation and clad with board and batten siding. The two wings of the L-shaped building hold a sanctuary and a parish hall. A large square castellated tower is located at one corner and a smaller tower with a pointed roof is atop the parish hall. The building front has an elaborate bargeboard, and a distinctive large round window. The remaining exterior windows are slender and pointed, with leaded glass inserts. On the interior is a vestibule with pointed windows, after which is the sanctuary. The sanctuary contains pews, doors, wainscoting, and window frames of dark wood.

History The first Methodist services in the village of Dixboro were performed in 1828. For the next 30 years, services were performed sporadically by circuit riders. Finally, in 1857, a group of Dixboro citizens met, elected a Board of Trustees, and authorized the building of a church for a price not to exceed $2500. The Board hired Ypsilanti, Michigan architect Abraham Cooper to design the church and Saline builder E. W. Ford to construct it. The building was completed in 1858, for a total cost of $2241. In 1920, a basement was dug underneath the church and a furnace installed. In 1950-51, a wing was added and the cupola was shortened. In 1969, a second wing was added. Finally, in 1997-98, the structure was completely renovated, and the cupola was restored to its original height. The church is still used for weekly services. Description The Dixboro United Methodist Church is a single-story, frame, Greek Revival structure topped with a square cupola and belfry. It is clad in clapboard siding. The front facade is divided into four bays by Doric pilasters, and a pedimented portico shelters the entrance. The entrance is flanked by triple-hung sash windows, which continue on each side of the church.

The complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1976. The complex is significant both because of its historical association with the early Irish Catholics in the area, and because of the architecturally important Gothic revival church. History Rectory Side view of church Interior of church In the early 19th century, a number of Irish Catholics began settling in this area of Michigan. In 1829, Kilkenny, Ireland native Father Patrick O'Kelly was dispatched to the area to minister to the growing community. The property upon which the present church now stands was purchased in 1831, and a log structure was constructed to serve as the first parish church. The parish was originally named \\"St. Brigid,\\" and is the oldest English-speaking Catholic parish in the state. Construction on the current church building was begun in 1875 and completed in 1878; the parish was renamed \\"St. Patrick's\\" at that time. A rectory was added in 1889-90. In 1917, a tornado badly damaged both the church and the rectory; both were rebuilt. The church is still used for weekly services. Description The St. Patrick's Parish complex contains a church with associated cemetery and rectory. The church is a red brick Gothic revival structure on a rough-hewn stone foundation. The fa√ßade of the church is symmetric, with a square central tower surmounted by an octagonal spire. The entrance is through a gabled projection at the base of the tower. A lancet window pierces the tower, and similar windows run along the building sides. The nearby rectory is a two- story center entrance brick structure.

History Entrance to Salem Walker Cemetery The first settlers in Salem Township arrived in 1825. The first burial in the Salem Walker Cemetery took place in 1834. The congregation of the Salem Methodist Episcopal Church formed in the mid-19th century, and met at various places in the township until the 25 members constructed a church adjacent to the cemetery in 1864. The congregation grew to about 60 by 1880, but later declined. Services continued at the church until 1912, after which the congregation abandoned it. In 1908, the Salem Walker Cemetery association founded to care for the cemetery and in 1930, it contacted the Methodist conference about purchasing the church.

Michigan Avenue in Saline, Michigan. It was added to the National Register in 1985 and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1995. History Original frame church, 1842‚Äì1898 In 1831, soon after the opening of the Erie Canal, a group of twelve Presbyterian families from Newark, New York pulled up stakes and headed westward to Detroit. The families settled in the area around what is now Saline, and immediately began holding church services. For a decade, these services were held in private homes, schools, or other meeting places; finally, in 1842, the Presbyterian congregation constructed a frame church on the site where the present church is located. This early church served the congregation until 1898, when the current church was constructed. The congregation hired Detroit architects Frederick H. Spier and William C. Rohns to design the church, and local contractor Conrad Schaffer and Son to build it. The structure and interior furnishings cost a total of $5,981. New porches and steps were constructed in 1954, using stones quarried from the same location as the original stones were. In the mid-1970s, the building was extensively renovated both inside and out. The sanctuary was renovated and restored in 1998, and is still used for services. Description The Saline Presbyterian Church is a brick Romanesque Revival structure, built with an irregular plan on a heavy stone foundation.

State Street in Ann Arbor, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. History The First Unitarian Society of Ann Arbor was formed in 1865, and began worshiping in what was once the Methodist Church. In 1878, Dr. Jabez T. Sunderland arrived in Ann Arbor as the pastor of the First Unitarian Church. One of the first projects he tackled in his 20-year tenure was the construction of a new church building. Sunderland raised $19,000 toward the cost of the structure, and the congregation hired the Detroit architectural firm of Donaldson and Meier to design the building. Construction on the building began in 1881, with the stonework done by the Walker Brothers firm of Ann Arbor, and it was completed in 1882. A student center addition was constructed in 1920. The Unitarian congregation used the building until 1946, when the congregation moved to Washtenaw Avenue. The Grace Bible Church congregation purchased the building that year and eventually leased the building to the Bible Church of True Holiness in 1971. Grace Bible Church moved to South Maple Road in 1975. The building was sold again in 1985 to D. B.

The play is inspired by the classic Beggar's Opera of John Gay and the Threepenny Opera, of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill. It is also a posthumous tribute to Paulo Pontes (1940‚Äì1976) (pt).  Synopsis and analysis  The √ìpera do Malandro reveals past features of Brazilian culture that still persist. A pimp called Duran disguises himself as a successful salesman. Vit√≥ria was a madam who also lived by selling her own body. Her daughter, Teresinha, had fallen in love with an upper-class citizen, Max Overseas, a man that lived off corruption in complicity with the chief Police officer, Chaves. The other characters are prostitutes, presented as saleswomen in a clothes store, and the promiscuous transvestite Geni, who was frequently attacked with rocks; people used to say she was \\"useful\\" because of this. The play's action takes place in the 1940s; its theme: gambling prohibition, prostitution and smuggling. Then it shows a context similar to the third millennium, with piracy and other black-market activities. Max Overseas really works in international businesses, even on the threshold of legality, in collusion with a pimp and the chief Police officer. All of the songs are composed by Chico, who, due to his brightness, manages to make them in harmony with the text. The song Geni e o Zepelim (the overture), tells about a transvestite whose only gift or skill is to be a \\"whipping-post\\" for the neighborhood. This fact, that is only revealed to spectators of the show, means that she has no value. Nevertheless, when the captain of a bright zeppelin intends to bombard the city, accepting to change his mind only if he had a one night stand with the transvestite, all the citizens ask her to consent to the captain's desires. The songs follow the pattern of rhymed and metrical verses, according to the intellectual tradition of the author's family.

Dancing Rain was the unanticipated winner of the 2011 Epsom Oaks and won the Preis der Diana in the later part of her three-year-old season. Her form faltered late in her three-year-old year, finishing 16th out of a field of 19 horses in the Queen Elizabeth II Commemorative Cup in Japan. Her four-year-old season was plagued with injury and she did not run in a race until late October 2012. Retired at the end of 2012, Dancing Rain became a broodmare at Clairemont Stud in Hampshire and was subsequently sold to Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum for ¬£4.2m while in foal to Frankel. Background Dancing Rain was bred by Swettenham Stud, a breeding operation owned by the Sangster family, and was foaled on 24 April 2008 at Camas Park Stud in Tipperary. Dancing Rain's sire, Danehill Dancer, stands at Coolmore Stud and also produced Choisir, a renowned sprinter. Her dam, Rain Flower, did not race and is a three-quarters sister to Epsom Derby winner Dr Devious. Rain Flower has produced nine foals to date, and five of her offspring have gone on to win races. Dancing Rain was consigned as a yearling by Camas Park Stud to the 2009 Goff's Orby Million and Sportsman's Yearling Sale in Ireland as lot (\\"Hip\\") number 4, where she was purchased by Liam Norris and William Huntingdon for ‚Ç¨200,000 ($292,120). Norris and Huntingdon purchased Dancing Rain on behalf of brothers Martin and Lee Taylor. Racing career Dancing Rain was trained by William Haggas, who also trained the 1996 Epsom Derby winner Shaamit, at his Somerville Lodge Stables in Newmarket. Dancing Rain won four of her ten career starts and was second twice. 2010: two-year-old start Dancing Rain was not a promising racehorse during her early training and was initially labeled as \\"hopeless\\" by her trainer. She improved late in the season and her first and only start as a two-year-old occurred on 19 October at Yarmouth for the Division 1 European Breeders' Fund Maiden Fillies Stakes. She was ridden by Michael Hills and was beaten by 3.5 lengths by the filly Annedah, who was owned by Ali Saeed. 2011: three-year-old season Dancing Rain won her first start as a three-year-old in the Robert Sangster Memorial Maiden Fillies Stakes on 15 April at Newbury Racecourse. She was jockeyed by Kieren Fallon who gave her \\"an uncompromising ride\\" and pushed the filly to the front to win the race by one and a quarter lengths from Highest. She was second in her next start at Newbury for the Fillies' Trial Stakes on 13 May, losing by a head to Izzi Top who was ridden by Dane O'Neill. One month before Dancing Rain's start in the Oaks, the filly broke the leg of her exercise rider and her trainer's wife, Maureen Haggas (a daughter of Lester Piggot) while performing drills. Dancing Rain was not favored to win the Oaks, starting the race with 20-1 odds. She was ridden by three-time Derby winning jockey Johnny Murtagh. She won by three quarters of a length over Wonder of Wonders and eleven other horses. Dancing Rain finished fifth in the Irish Oaks on 17 July, leading the race three furlongs from the finish line and weakening under \\"a relentless drive\\" from the winning filly Blue Bunting and passed by Banimpire, Wonder of Wonders and Laughing Lashes. Dancing Rain became the first British-trained winner of the ‚Ç¨400,000 Preis der Diana on 7 August in D√ºsseldorf, and ridden by Kieren Fallon, \\"she shot away from her rivals in the straight\\" to win by a margin of three lengths. She won again at Ascot in the British Champions Fillies' and Mares' Stakes beating Bible Belt by two lengths. In her final start of the season, Dancing Rain ran in the Queen Elizabeth II Commemorative Cup in Kyoto Racecourse. A few days before the race, Dancing Rain developed \\"some heat in her front legs\\" that was treated with ice baths. Dancing Rain was \\"never a factor\\" in the race, finishing in 16th place, far behind Snow Fairy who won the race for a consecutive year. 2012: four-year-old season Dancing Rain sustained an ankle injury in the spring of 2012 and her engagement in the Coronation Cup was suspended. Surgery was performed in the spring of 2012. Dancing Rain was engaged for the Yorkshire Oaks, but a week before the race Haggas withdrew her from competition, stating, \\"I'm afraid she won't be going to York as we're just not happy with her.\\" In her first start of the season, she was third in the British Champions Fillies' and Mares' Stakes run at Ascot, losing by two and three quarters lengths to Sapphire and Shirocco Star. On 9 December ridden by Johnny Murtagh, Dancing Rain finished eighth out of 12 starters in the Hong Kong Vase won by Red Cadeaux. Breeding career Dancing Rain was retired from racing at the end of 2012 to her owner's Clairemont Stud in Hampshire. She was confirmed to be in foal to Frankel and in December 2013, while still in foal to Frankel, she was auctioned for 4 million guineas (¬£4.2m) at Tattersalls sales to John Ferguson, acting on behalf of Sheikh Mohammed. The selling price was the second-highest price ever paid at auction for a broodmare in Europe at the time. Dancing Rain gave birth to her first foal, a bay filly by Frankel, in February 2014. Bred to New Approach, she produced another filly in February 2015. *2014 Rainswept (GB) : Bay filly, foaled 5 February, by Frankel (GB) - entered training with Andre Fabre at Chantilly; unraced. *2015 Magic Lily (GB): Chestnut filly, foaled 11 February, by New Approach (IRE)- Won Cape Verdi, third in the Group 1 bet365 Fillies' Mile. *2016 Jalmoud (GB): Chestnut colt (gelded) by New Approach (IRE), foaled 24 February- Won Listed Prix de l'Avre. *2017 Filly by Dubawi (IRE) Pedigree * Dancing Rain is distantly inbred 4 √ó 4 to Northern Dancer, meaning this horse appears twice in the fourth generation of her pedigree.

Background The formation of the Consultative Committee was decided at the first meeting of the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee (BLDC), for consultation with the Hong Kong people on various drafts of the Hong Kong Basic Law. The membership of the BLCC was completely consisted of Hong Kong persons. 25 of the Hong Kong members of the Drafting Committee formed a Sponsors Committee to work on the formation of the BLCC. The five BLDC vice-chairmen residing in Hong Kong including Xu Jiatun were asked to take up the preparatory work for setting up the BLCC while the Xinhua News Agency provided the necessary assistance. Three of the tycoons on the BLDC provided necessary funds to cover costs. The appointment of Consultative Committee was opposed by some influential members from the business sector in the Drafting Committee, as it introduced an unnecessary degree of democracy and public participation. In the end the BLDC members had considerable influence over the composition and work of the Consultative Committee since they drafted the constitution of the BLCC. After almost six months of preparations, the Consultative Committee was formally established on 18 December 1985. T. K. Ann, chief opponent of the Consultative Committee and vice-chairman of the BLDC was appointed the chair of the BLCC and other members were given key positions through procedures of dubious validity. Mao Junnian, the Secretary General of the BLCC, was subsequently replaced by Leung Chun-ying. Composition The Consultative Committee had 180 members. Some of members were nominated by designated organisations, but most of them were invited directly by the Drafting Committee members, who also vetoed over nominations of the organisations. The BLCC members also included the Senior Unofficial Members of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, Lydia Dunn and of the Executive Council, Chung Sze-yuen, who were appointed by the British colonial government. It also included a number of social activists who called for a faster pace of democratic reform, such as Lee Wing-tat and Frederick Fung. The Consultative Committee was criticised of favouring over the conservative business and professional interests, and nominating some key pro-Beijing figures. Lau Chin-shek of the Hong Kong Christian Industrial Committee was initially nominated by a labour joint conference to stand for selection by was turned down by Xu Jiatun on the ground that \\"quite a few businessmen in Hong Kong resented him.\\" The Consultative Committee formed eight sub-groups, namely the structure of the Basic Law; the political structure; law; residents' rights and duties; finance, business, and economy; culture, science and technology, education and religion; external affairs; and the relationship between Central Authorities and the Special Administrative Region. Although it was planned to seek the views of Hong Kong residents, groups, ministries and individuals in China, but no formal machinery was established for this purpose. The effectiveness of the BLCC was doubted as the public opinion was pushed through the BLCC which the Consultative Committee would merely report the diversity of the views to the Drafting Committee, but not indicate the degree of public support of the public views. Election At the first meeting of the Consultative Committee during the election of the executive committee of the BLCC, a BLDC member, Y. K. Pao showed up to chair the meeting although he was not a BLCC member. He ignored procedures and proceeded to read out a list of 19 names saying who would be the chairman and who would be secretary is so on, and then he directed the gathered members to elect them with a round of applause. This kind of arrangement was commonplace on the Mainland but not in Hong Kong and it led to complaints. Although another meeting was called to rectify the violation of procedures, the same nineteen members were chosen and seven officers were also \\"elected\\". Factions The dominating group within the Consultative Committee was the Business and Professional Group of the Basic Law Consultative Committee, as known as the Group of 89, led by tycoon Vincent Lo. It was formed in April 1985 by 57 BLCC members and later added two more members. Subsequently, the liberal community representatives, social workers and professionals BLCC members formed the Group of 190. However it was a small group compared to the Group of 89 without resources that the business elites commanded. To avoid future divisions, the Chinese government created the positions of Hong Kong Affairs Adviser and District Affairs Adviser in 1992. The highly honorific titles helped to prevent disputes in Beijing's 'united front'. Consultation process The BLCC held two rounds of consultation on drafting the Basic Law. The first was from May to September in 1986, the second from February to October in 1989. During the first consultation period, the BLCC received 73,000 submissions for the electoral issues of the legislature after 1997. There were also many public meetings being held and discussions in the media. The response in the second period was smaller as it was taken over by the Tiananmen Square event. After the Tiananmen massacre on 4 June 1989, the Consultative Committee suspended its work for a few weeks. The BLCC ceased to exist of the Basic Law was adopted by the National People's Congress on 4 April 1990 and promulgated the same day by the President of the People's Republic of China, Yang Shangkun.

The chop block is usually considered illegal and penalized by a loss of 15-yards due to the injury risk it presents to the defender. NFL In the National Football League (NFL), a chop block is an illegal move, penalized by a 15-yard loss. Before the 2016 NFL owners meeting,NFL eliminates all 'chop' style blocks for 2016 season chop blocks were legal under certain circumstances. It was considered legal on running plays when (i) the blockers were aligned next to each other on the line of scrimmage, (ii) the blockers were lined up anywhere on the line and the flow of the play is towards the block or (iii) the cut blocker was aligned in the backfield and the chop block took place outside the original tight end position.Drawn from Rule 12, Section 2, Article 3 The cut blocker is said to \\"chop\\" the defender and usually engages simultaneously with or immediately after the high block. A \\"reverse chop\\" occurs when the high block comes immediately after the low block and the same rules apply. NCAA In the NCAA, chop blocks are penalized by a 15-yard loss. Chop blocks were first banned in the NCAA in 1980. CFL In the Canadian Football League (CFL), chop blocking is defined as cut blocking a player already engaged, physically or otherwise, with another blocker. It is always illegal and carries a 15-yard penalty.Drawn from Rule 7, Section 2, Article 7  Injury risks  Although there were many variations and reforms made to the chop block technique, it was finally deemed illegal prior to the 2016‚Äì2017 season in the NFL, mainly due to the high probability of athlete injury. In its very nature, the chop block technique aims for the thigh area and lower, which leaves the player being chop blocked susceptible to knee and ankle injury. This kind of contact, towards the knee and ankle, lead to injuries such as medial collateral ligament (MCL) and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).

The five-cent coin was introduced when the New Zealand dollar was introduced on 10 July 1967, replacing the New Zealand sixpence coin. On 31 July 2006 it was eliminated as part of a revision of New Zealand's coins, and it was demonetised (no longer legal tender) as of 1 November 2006.http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/notes-and-coins/coins/history-of-new- zealand-coinage History The five-cent coin was introduced on 10 July 1967 with the decimalisation of New Zealand currency, where the New Zealand dollar replaced the New Zealand pound at a rate of two dollars to a pound, with six pence in the old pound currency equaling five cents in the new one. The new five cent coin was the same size and composition as the old sixpence coin it replaced to ease the transition. The coin was made of cupronickel, 19.43 mm in diameter, and weighed 2.83 grams. By the early 2000s, the five-cent coin had become of little value due to inflation. The coin was subsequently demonetised effective 1 November 2006. Counting proofs and coins in mint sets, a total of 617,508,200 (618 million) coins of the denomination were minted during its existence. In 2017, American author John Green requested that some of the coins be given to him to give away as gifts on his upcoming book tour.
