Uses  4,4’-Oxydianiline is used in the production of a wide variety of polymer resins. The primary use lies in the production of polyimide and poly(ester)imide resins. These resins are used for their temperature-resistant properties and are utilized in products including wire enamels, coatings, film, adhesives, insulating varnishes, coated fabrics, flame-retardant fibers, oil sealants and retainers, insulation for cables and printed circuits, and laminates and composite for aerospace vehicles. Other applications of 4,4’-oxydianiline include the production of poly(amide)imide resins (which are used in the manufacture of heat-resistant wire enamels and coatings), as an intermediate in the manufacture of epoxy resins and adhesives, and in the production of aromatic polyether imides. A specific reaction involving industrial use of 4,4’-oxydianiline is in the production of thermostable poly(amideurea) acids, which can be prepared from 4,4’-oxydianiline, pyromellitic dianhydride, and diisocyanates.

It was videotaped in black-and-white and featured musicians playing in traditional American music genres such as traditional folk music, old-time music, bluegrass and blues. The show's title is drawn from the lyrics of the song by Seeger \\"Oh, Had I A Golden Thread\\". Production The program was produced on a low budget funded by Seeger and his co-producer, Sholom Rubinstein. Seeger's wife, Toshi Seeger, given the title \\"Chief Cook and Bottle Washer\\" in the closing credits after each show, actually functioned as the director by dint of the fact that she continually made suggestions to Rubinstein that he passed along to the camera operators. Eventually the cameramen simply followed her instructions without waiting for Rubinstein to repeat them. The shows were unrehearsed and there was no studio audience even though Seeger's metier was leading his audiences in song. Songs were traded between Seeger and his guests and Seeger often joined in while his guests performed. One show was dedicated to Woody Guthrie and another to Lead Belly. Lead Belly had died long before and Guthrie was incapacitated with Huntington's disease. Both shows featured film clips of the legendary singer/songwriters who had been close friends of Seeger's. Many of the other shows featured film clips made by the Seegers during their travels in the U.S. and elsewhere, including a demonstration in Mexico of guitar-making and another in the West Indies of making a steel drum. Altogether 39 shows, each 52 minutes long, were recorded in 1965–66 at WNJU-TV (Channel 47), a New York City-based UHF station with studios in Newark, New Jersey. The shows were broadcast by Channel 47, primarily a Spanish-language outlet, to a very limited audience because only televisions equipped with a UHF antenna and tuner could receive them, and reception was difficult in an age prior to cable. For a few years in 1967–68, the shows were repeated on public television station WNDT (Channel 13, now WNET). Among the guests featured on the program's 39 episodes were Johnny Cash, June Carter, Reverend Gary Davis, Mississippi John Hurt, Doc Watson, The Stanley Brothers, Elizabeth Cotten, Patrick Sky, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Judy Collins, Donovan, Richard Fariña and Mimi Fariña, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, Mamou Cajun Band, Bernice Johnson Reagon, The Beers Family, Roscoe Holcomb, Sonia Malkine, Cousin Emmy and Shawn Phillips. The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem and Tom Paxton appeared on the first show of the series on short notice because Seeger felt ill, as he explained on camera. Only Paddy and Liam appeared of the Clancy Brothers. No explanation was given for Tom Clancy's absence from the group. A clip of Tommy Makem singing \\"The Butcher Boy\\" during this initial episode appeared in Martin Scorsese's Grammy-winning documentary about Bob Dylan and the early influences on him, No Direction Home. Publication In 1980, Norman Ross, president of Clearwater Publishing in New York, a firm that was primarily a publisher of microfilms and reference books, proposed to publish the series on videocassette. (At that time VHS and Betamax were relatively new inventions.) Ross's company, whose name was eponymous with the nonprofit organization founded by Seeger and the boat at the center of the organization's efforts to clean the Hudson River, was not affiliated with the organization. (Ross had named his publishing company Clearwater in honor of Seeger.) However, when Ross began having the 2\\" broadcast masters copied onto 3/4\\" cassettes to be used as dubmasters, it became clear that the studio tapes had badly deteriorated while in the vault. A local video studio, Devlin, reported that the surface of the tapes was flaking off, which had damaged their equipment and resulted in copies that were of very poor quality. Devlin resigned from the job. Another studio in New York examined one of the tapes and reported that it could be rescued by passing it through a chemical bath several times and then transferring the image to new media. However, they estimated that the 2\\" tapes would only survive one such pass, and the cost would be $19,500 for the 39 shows, a sum that was far too costly for either Ross or the original producers to justify at that point. On the other hand, the loss of all 39 shows would have been a great tragedy, given the unique qualities of the series. At the suggestion of Manny Kirchheimer, an independent film maker whose wife Gloria was an editor at Clearwater Publishing, the decision was made to seek a grant for the work and a proposal was prepared under the aegis of The Woody Guthrie Foundation, whose director, Harold Leventhal, was also Pete Seeger's manager. The proposal was submitted to the National Endowment for the Arts, where Bess Lomax Hawes (sister of the folklorist Alan Lomax), who had sung with Seeger and Woody Guthrie, among others, as a member of the Almanac Singers, was one of the key people involved in making the decision. Thus the grant was awarded, the tapes were processed and two new sets were created: 1\\" tapes that went back into the vault and 3/4\\" videocassettes that became the dubmasters for Clearwater Publishing, which then proceeded to offer copies of the series for sale. Because Clearwater's marketing efforts were primarily directed to libraries, sales were sparse through the '80s and '90s, especially prior to the advent of the Internet, and only a few thousand cassettes were sold in total. However, a number of libraries acquired the complete (38 shows) collection, including University of Wisconsin-Madison, University of Pennsylvania, Ohio State University, National University (available only to National University faculty in San Diego), and the Tokyo Folklore Center. During this period Sun Video, owned by Caspar Weinberger, Jr., offered a small selection of the shows to the general public. In 2003 Ross, having sold both Clearwater Publishing and his subsequent firm, Norman Ross Publishing, withdrew from the agreement. A subsequent agreement with Shanachie, negotiated by Rubinstein, resulted in 12 of the shows becoming available on DVD, however the remaining 27 were no longer available for sale. Two episodes, one featuring Tommy Makem and another featuring Johnny Cash and June Carter were available on Netflix' streaming service as of December 2011. Sholom Rubinstein died a few years later. In September 2015 archivist and librarian Karl-Rainer Blumenthal announced that he had uploaded copies of 10 available episodes to the Internet Archive. His blog post, with streaming players for the videos, originally included a footnote stating that \\"The show has been in the public domain since the 1990s\\"; he has since edited his comment, noting that he \\"cannot confidently characterize the copyright status of this work\\".Blumenthal, Karl-Rainer: \\"Let's revive Pete Seeger's Rainbow Quest\\" http://landscapelibrarian.com/blog/2015/7/25/rainbow-quest Meanwhile, a number of YouTube subscribers have uploaded full episodes or individual performances from the series to that video hosting site, where they can be found with a simple search on the program title (with Seeger's name, to eliminate a racehorse called \\"Rainbow Quest\\"), or by searching for individual rarely-seen artists, such as Richard Farina.

Coker Experimental Farms, also known as Coker Pedigreed Seed Company, is a National Historic Landmark agricultural site at 1257 South Fourth Street in Hartsville, South Carolina, USA. Now a museum property, the property was where David R. Coker performed critical breeding experiments to improve strains of cotton and other crops grown throughout the American South. Coker was a major force in the development of agricultural extension services in the South in the early decades of the 20th century. What remains of his farm was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964. and Description and history The Coker family once owned thousands of acres of agricultural lands in the area around Hartsville, South Carolina. At their main station south of the city, David R. Coker began to apply techniques in plant hybridization discovered by Gregor Mendel in the 1860s and only brought to wider notice around the turn of the 20th century. His first experiments involved attempts to breed cotton with a longer staple, and to improve resistance to disease and pests. Coker eventually broadened his work to other crops, and was a major force in improving the education of farmers in the American South through the use of agricultural extension services. By 1963, more than half the cotton grown in the South was derived from Coker seeds, as were larger percentages of oat and tobacco crops. A warehouse in Hartsville, South Carolina belonging to the Coker Pedigreed Seed Company. The old heart logo that used to say \\"Blood Will Tell\\" is still visible on the tin roof. Of the original Coker farm holdings, some of the area used by Coker in his breeding experiments was listed as a National Historic Landmark in 1964 for its significance in revolutionizing the field of agriculture in the South. This area was roughly bounded on the south by United States Route 15, the east by Swift Creek Road, the north by the Seaboard Air Line tracks, and the west by a line paralleling west of South Carolina Highway 151, and included farm outbuildings dating to the 1930s in the west side of Highway 151. By the 1990s, the outbuildings had been demolished, and the land on the west side of Highway 151 developed commercially, and the landmark designation was reduced to , solely to the east of Highway 151. Since then, portions of the land on the east side have also been developed. A further-reduced parcel of farmland remains, on which a barn- shaped museum has been built to interpret the property and its importance.

In Scotland, the equivalent role is advocate's clerk. There are about 1,200 barristers' clerks in England and Wales. Around 350 are senior clerks. A group of 20 barristers normally employs one senior clerk and one or two junior clerks. More than half the clerks work in London, mainly in and around the four Inns of Court, with the remainder being in other large towns and cities. In the UK, the profession is regulated by the Institute of Barristers' Clerks. Barristers employ clerks to organise their bookings and provide messaging, telephone and accounting services. Clerks have detailed knowledge about the barristers on their list. They provide solicitors and others with information about the availability of barristers and advise on the choice of barrister.The Victorian Bar - DIRECTORIES - Barristers Clerks In recent years and in line with modernisation of the barristers' profession, an increasing number of barristers no longer employ clerks but manage their fees and time themselves or use modern management structures.  Typical activities  Clerks manage their barristers' time through diary management (e.g. when they have to be in court); clerks negotiate their fees; and clerks advise them on how their careers should be structured (e.g. what kind of law to specialise in, or when to become a Queen's Counsel). They may receive a percentage of the barristers' fees for this work. A barristers' clerk is responsible for running the business activities and administration of a barristers' chambers. The role is integral to the success of a set of chambers as a business and as a practice. Barristers' clerks must be familiar with court procedures and etiquette. They will also develop an expertise in the branch of law undertaken by their chambers. A barristers' clerk requires a combination of commercial acumen, legal knowledge and strong interpersonal skills. The term \\"clerk\\" is historical and does not accurately reflect the co-ordination of workload, marketing and financial management undertaken. Barrister's clerks are also responsible for client management, including attending client meetings to set up and forge relationships with individual solicitors and solicitors firms that deal with the work their barristers and chambers specialise in, sometimes this can mean travelling around the country (and in some cases abroad) to see clients. = The Role of a Junior Barristers' Clerk = Generally a junior barristers' clerk acts as an assistant to other senior and more experienced staff, increasingly assuming more responsibility over a period of time, including the allocation of briefs and negotiation of fees. One of the most significant duties that a junior barristers' clerk will undertake is to arrange the diary and general work programme of the barristers. The junior barristers' clerk is usually the first point of contact between a solicitor seeking the services of a barrister, and the barrister. Junior barristers' clerks need to be consistently professional in their approach and show positive attitudes and behaviours. The barristers' clerk needs to ensure that whichever barrister they put forward has the ability, competence and time to perform the assignment; so the barristers' clerk needs to be up to date with the barrister's diary and commitments. For a newly appointed barristers’ clerk, relationships with barristers in chambers, instructing solicitors, the court service and many other outside agencies is paramount. Depending on the size of chambers and the available staff resources, the typical responsibilities of a junior barristers' clerk will include some or all of the following: * Dealing with incoming and outgoing post * Collecting and delivering documents * Maintaining and updating court lists * Maintaining and filing briefs/instructions * Communicating with clients, court staff, solicitors, other chambers and various outside agencies * Dealing with routine telephone enquiries * Attending court listing meetings and representing their chambers' interests * Arranging court listings via the telephone * Fee billing * Diary management * Maintaining the stock of stationery and chambers brochures * Updating and maintaining chambers library References Legal professions ","title":"Barristers' clerk"},{"id":"15996046","text":"Bisphenol S (BPS) is an organic compound with the formula (HOC6H4)2SO2. It has two phenol functional groups on either side of a sulfonyl group. It is commonly used in curing fast-drying epoxy resin adhesives. It is a bisphenol, and a close analog of bisphenol A (BPA) in which the dimethylmethylene group (C(CH3)2) is replaced with a sulfone group (SO2).  Use  BPA Free Plastic BPS is used in curing fast-drying epoxy glues and as a corrosion inhibitor. It is also commonly used as a reactant in polymer reactions. BPS has become increasingly common as a building block in polycarbonates and some epoxies, following the public awareness that BPA has estrogen-mimicking properties, and widespread-belief that enough of it remains in the products to be dangerous. However, BPS may have comparable estrogenic effects to BPA. BPS is now used to a variety of common consumer products. In some cases, BPS is used where the legal prohibition on BPA allows products (esp. plastic containers) containing BPS to be labelled \\"BPA free\\". BPS also has the advantage of being more stable to heat and light than BPA. To comply with restrictions and regulations on BPA due to its confirmed toxicity, manufacturers are gradually replacing BPA with other related compounds, mainly bisphenol S, as substitutes in industrial applications. BPS is also used as an anticorrosive agent in epoxy glues. Chemically, BPS is being used as a reagent in polymer reactions. BPS has also been reported to occur in canned foodstuffs, such as tin cans. In a recent study analyzing BPS in a variety of paper products worldwide, BPS was found in 100% of tickets, mailing envelopes, airplane boarding passes, and airplane luggage tags. In this study, very high concentrations of BPS were detected in thermal receipt samples collected from cities in the United States, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. The BPS concentrations were large but varied greatly, from a few tens of nanograms per gram to several milligrams per gram. Nevertheless, concentrations of BPS used in thermal paper are usually lower compared to those of BPA. Finally, BPS can get into the human body through dermal absorption from handling banknotes.  Health Effects  Main article: BPA Controversy = Cardiac Effects = Although there is no direct link established between BPS and cardiac disease, it is thought that BPS may operate by a similar mechanism to BPA and could cause cardiac toxicity. In animal studies, BPS has been shown to hinder MI recovery, induce cardiac arrhythmias and cause cardiac developmental deformities. Rats exposed to high doses of BPS were reported to have increased risk of atherosclerosis (a significant risk factor in cardiac disease) due to BPS inducing synthesis of cholesterol in peripheral tissues. = Neurobehavioural Effects = BPS has the potential to have an effect on a wide range of neurological functions. A recent study showed that exposure to BPS during pregnancy may disrupt thyroid hormone levels. These are important in foetal neurodevelopment and prenatal exposure to BPS has been linked to impaired psychomotor development in children. In a study using human embryonic stem cells, BPS was shown to cause a reduction in length of neurites in neuron-like cells. This disruption could lead to neurobehavioral problems such as ASD. The mechanism of the neurological impact of BPS is thought to be related to its oestrogenic effect which can interfere in the levels and action of thyroid hormone, which is essential for normal development of the nervous system; it regulates migration and differentiation of neural cells, synaptogenesis and myelination. = Effects on Obesity = It has been proposed that BPS has the potential to affect body weight, and several studies have found a correlation between exposure to bisphenols and increased body weight. This is thought to be due to an accumulation of lipids in adipocytes i.e. a build-up of fat in fat cells. It has also been suggested that BPS leads to the formation of new adipocytes as exposure to it increases the expression of related markers. A correlation between exposure to BPS before birth and being overweight has been found in mice, although this was only found when they were also fed a high fat diet. The pathway through which BPS acts on cells to increase body weight is suggested to be different to the pathway through which BPA acts, even though they have very similar chemical structures. Only one study has demonstrated a decrease in body weight after BPS exposure, and the affected mice quickly regained the weight they had lost. = Other Metabolic Effects = BPS levels in the human body can be measured in the urine. In one study of children, there was a significant correlation between urinary levels of BPS and insulin resistance, abnormal kidney function and abnormal vascular function. It has been suggested that there is a link between gestational diabetes mellitus and urinary BPS. Therefore, exposure to BPS may be a risk factor for developing the condition. = Effects on Skeletal Development = The effect of long term exposure to BPS is an enrichment of osteoclast differentiation and enhanced development of the embryonic skeletal system. = Effects on Early Development = BPS, like BPA, can cross the placenta in sheep and alter the endocrine functionality of the placenta. It does this by reducing the maternal serum concentration of trophoblastic proteins. BPS shows almost identical effects on the placenta as BPA, with both BPS and BPS altering almost identical sets of genes. Fetal exposure to BPS through the placenta, during a critical period, can have negative effects on the developmental programming of the fetus. BPS exposure in the zebrafish model affected development of the hypothalamus and resulted in hyperactive behaviour. Studies in the Mouse model have shown that exposure to BPS significantly reduced the secretion of testosterone within the mouse fetal testes, with exposure to BPS in female mice also causing a significant fall in egg number, whilst also negatively affecting the quality of oocytes. Studies in the Zebrafish model have shown that parental exposure to BPS causes disrupted thyroid hormone levels in both the parental generation and F1 generation. It is not clear the mechanism of BPS’s effect on thyroid hormone levels after human exposure. = Effects on Reproductive Health = The endocrine disrupting nature of BPS has encouraged investigations into its affinity to estrogenic receptors, showing BPS to be a weak agonist; similar in potency to BPA, which it has come to substitute. Select studies show BPS to be capable of mimicking estradiol, and sometimes being more effective. The estrogenic activity of BPS has been demonstrated through in vivo rodent studies, inducing growth of the womb, with a range of dosages . These are pathways necessary for cell function, cell cycle regulation, and neuroendocrine induced behaviours which are important for reproduction. BPS has shown to both disrupt signalling and damage DNA. Androgenic and antiandrogenic activity have also been confirmed by BPS disrupting function of the androgen receptors. Studies on zebrafish have shown decreased egg quality, reduced sperm count, an increased frequency of embryo abnormalities, as well as changes in the mass of gonads; suggesting that BPS is a reproductive toxin for both sexes.  Environmental considerations  Recent work suggests that, like BPA, BPS also has endocrine disrupting properties. What makes BPS, and BPA, endocrine disruptors is the presence of the hydroxy group on the benzene ring. This phenol moiety allows BPA and BPS to mimic estradiol. In a study of human urine, BPS was found in 81% of the samples tested. This percentage is comparable to BPA which was found in 95% of urine samples. Another study done on thermal receipt paper shows that 88% of human exposure to BPS is through receipts. The recycling of thermal paper can introduce BPS into the cycle of paper production and cause BPS contamination of other types of paper products.European Commission-Joint Research Centre. European Union Risk Assessment Report, 4,4′-Isopropylidenediphenol (Bisphenol-A). 2008, available from http://ecb.jrc.ec.europa.eu/documents/ExistingChemicals/RISK_ASSESSMENT/ADDENDUM/bisphenola_add_ 325.pdf A recent study showed presence of BPS in more than 70% of the household waste paper samples, potentially indicating spreading of BPS contamination through paper recycling. BPS is more resistant to environmental degradation than BPA, and although not persistent cannot be characterised as readily biodegradable.  History  BPS was first made in 1869 as a dye and is currently common in everyday consumer products. BPS is an analog of BPA that has replaced BPA in a variety of ways, being present in thermal receipt paper, plastics, and indoor dust. After health concerns associated with bisphenol A grew in 2012, BPS began to be used as a replacement.  Regulation  It is difficult for consumers to determine if a product contains BPS due to limited labeling regulations.  Synthesis  Bisphenol S is prepared by the reaction of two equivalents of phenol with one equivalent of sulfuric acid or oleum.METHOD OF PREPARATION OF 4,4′-DIHYDROXYDIPHENYLSULPHONE (Freepatentsonline). :2 C6H5OH + H2SO4 → (C6H4OH)2SO2 \\\\+ 2 H2O :2 C6H5OH + SO3 → (C6H4OH)2SO2 \\\\+ H2O This reaction can also produce 2,4'-sulfonyldiphenol, a common isomeric complication in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. :Chemical reaction to bisphenol S  See also  * Bisphenol A * Tetramethyl Bisphenol F  References  Bisphenols Endocrine disruptors Estrogens Nonsteroidal antiandrogens Benzosulfones ","title":"Bisphenol S"},{"id":"15996051","text":"The Union Hotel was established by the Murray family in La Porte, California in 1855.

During his career, Lizardi represented Puerto Rico in several international tournaments including two Summer Olympic Games. On February 21, 2008, Lizardi died in a car accident when his car struck a parked truck on the back. The circumstances of the accident are still being investigated. Biography Diego Lizardi Marcial was born in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico. In 1981, while 6 years old, he started studying at the Gymnastic School in Cupey. Later, he studied at the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico in Hato Rey. He started rising as a gifted gymnast winning several national championships in \\"All Around\\" competitions. From 1988 to 2001, he gathered 13 championships in various levels. In 1990, Lizardi participated in his first international competition at the 1990 Central American and Caribbean Games held in Mexico. The Puerto Rican team rose in this tournament with the bronze medal. In 1993, he rose with the silver medal at the same tournament, this time held at Ponce, Puerto Rico. He also has won 9 world championships during this period. In 1996, he participated at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, finishing at the 64th spot. He participated again at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. In 2003, he was selected as Puerto Rico's flag bearer for the 2003 Pan American Games held at Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. After retiring as a competitive athlete, Lizardi continued collaborating with the Puerto Rico Gymnastics Federation while he created private gymnastics training centers throughout Puerto Rico. Lizardi died February 21, 2008, in a late night car accident when his car struck a parked truck. At the time, he was working to open another gymnastics school for kids in Puerto Rico's third largest city, Ponce. Hundreds of Puerto Ricans attended funeral services at the Puerto Rico Olympic Headquarters in Old San Juan where, in the presence of Lizardi's widow and parents, acting Governor Fernando Bonilla declared him to be Puerto Rico's \\"Eternal Standard-Bearer\\" (\\"El Eterno Abanderado\\") and then Puerto Rico Senate President Kenneth McClintock made a commitment to appropriate the funds necessary to hold the International Gymnastics Competition that Lizardi proposed to hold in 2009 in San Juan in his last conversation with McClintock's wife, San Juan Sports and Recreation Director María Elena Batista. Then Sports and Recreation Secretary David Bernier seconded the senator's proposal. Lizardi's body was later cremated. In June, 2008, at the request of Senate of Puerto Rico President Kenneth McClintock, Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Migdalia Padilla and former Senate President Antonio Fas Alzamora, the Puerto Rico Legislature appropriated $25,000 for a statue of Diego Lizardi to be placed at the Puerto Rico Sports Museum in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico.

As the first company to produce bicycles in Korea, this was in effect, the beginning of the bicycle industry in Korea. By January 1945, Samchuly was producing many components of the bicycle, including the chain, hub, crank, pedals, and other parts in its own factory. In April 1952, during the Korean war, Samchuly started manufacturing complete bicycles for the first time. This was 85 years after Ernest Michaux started mass- producing bicycles in France. Samchuly was the first to manufacture and sell a complete bicycle in Korea. =1965-1984= As the Korean economy struggled to grow, Samchuly decided to export bicycles to the United States and shipped their first set of bicycles in 1965. President Park Chung-Hee visited Samchuly's factory at Siheung and encouraged Samchuly to help Korea industrialize in the 1970s. Exports to the United States grew very rapidly in the 1970s, with annual exports averaging 100,000 bicycles. By the 1980s, annual exports averaged 300,000 bicycles. =1985-2007= In 1985, Korea established a designated manufacturing complex at Daegu to build bicycles and component parts. This complex planned to establish a manufacturing capacity of 3 million bicycles- one million for domestic consumption and two million for exports. With the support of the government, in 1987, Samchuly was able to manufacture 1 million bicycles from its factory at Yangsan. The following year, the year of the Seoul Olympics, Samchuly exported over 2 million bicycles to the United States alone. In 1991, Samchuly began producing the popular Lespo models. The firm received ISO 9001 certification in 1995.products from korea =2008-= By 2008, the Korean government started to promote environmentally friendly, green policies. A plan to build over 5,200 km of new bicycle paths and roads was released. As well, the Four Major Rivers Project was announced and as a result, plans to build bicycle paths connecting the Han River in Seoul; the Nakdong River in the Gyeongsang provinces, the Geum River in the Chungcheong and North Jeolla regions, and the Yeongsan River in South Jeolla, were announced. In response to government supported policies, Samchuly reviewed the possibility of manufacturing higher end bicycles in Korea. In July 2009, Samchuly broke ground for its Uiwang factory, which was built for the purpose of manufacturing high-end bicycles such as Cello Sports, a subsidiary brand of Samchuly. The production capacity of the Uiwang factory is 300,000 bicycles.

He has authored historical essays about the origins of the Spanish Civil War, the Second Republic in Spain, Francoism and the various political movements of that era. Following the death of Franco and the reinstatement of a democratic regime in Spain, a slow process of opening of archives and publicizing of Civil War related documents began.Miguel I. Campos. La historiografía española y la internacionalización de la Guerra Civil. Ab Initio, Núm. 5 (2012) In the face of this process Moa started reviving the Francoist theses that the parties which formed the Popular Front were ultimately responsible for the Spanish Civil War and the rise of autocracy in Spain. Moa maintains that they have left a legacy of \\"moral, political and intellectual devastation\\", accusing the left of hypocrisy in regards to democracy and totalitarianism, as well as claims that the material aid provided by Stalin and the USSR to the Spanish Republic in the Civil War not only prolonged the war causing innumerable deaths but was also equivalent to the help provided by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy to General Franco.Enrique Moradiellos García, Visiones de la guerra civil española: Acotaciones sobre una polémica a tres bandas The polemical nature of Moa's writings have gained him much public attention in Spain and a measure of controversy as a result; his best-selling book, Myths of the Civil War, with 150,000 units sold, was a best-seller for six consecutive months. As well as being praised by historians such as Stanley Payne, which condemn the \\"silent treatment\\" given to Moa by the mainstream media. Biography =Early years as a radical= Born during 1948 in Vigo, Galicia, Spain. During his youth, Moa was a radical anti-Francoist agitator. He was a militant of the Communist Party of Spain (and its reconstituted version), as well as the clandestine Maoist, designated-terrorist organisation GRAPO. It was involved in violent clashes with the government's Movimiento Nacional. Moa was present at the murder of a policeman on 1 October 1975, carried out after the execution of two ETA and three FRAP members. Two other members of GRAPO, Enrique Cerdán Calixto and Abelardo Collazo Araújo, were also present; Cerdán shot the police officer. Moa was expelled from GRAPO in 1977, he later recalled this period of his life in About a time and a country, the violent Left. Following the transition of Spain to democracy, Moa dedicated himself to the study of contemporary Spanish history, evolving over time to a Francoist position. =Intellectual evolution and writing= After the Spanish transition to democracy his opinions changed towards increasingly conservative positions. He is an outspoken critic of the Spanish political left which he accuses of being the main cause of the Spanish Civil War.En cuanto a mis tesis..., Pío Moa, Libertad Digital, 25 January 2007. He has also written essays on feminism, marxism, current Spanish politics and an autobiographical book about his experiences in the terrorist group GRAPO. In his books he criticizes strongly Franco's communist, socialist and nationalist rivals. Moa is rejected as pseudo-historian and revisionist by several historians,\\"Pro-Franco history tops bestseller list\\", The Guardian, 14 November 2005.¿Qué es un historiador?, Pío Moa, Libertad Digital, 6 November 2006. such as Paul Preston, Alberto Reig Tapia, Javier Tusell, Justo Serna, Mercedes Yusta, Santos Juliá or Enrique Moradiellos.

He commanded several concentration camps, including Sachsenhausen, before becoming a commander of the SS-Freiwilligen Legion Flandern and the SS Division Frundsberg. He is known for co-murdering SA leader Ernst Röhm on 1 July 1934. In 1957, he was sentenced to 18 months in prison by a West German court for his part in Röhm's murder. Career in the SS Lippert joined the Nazi Party (number - 246,989) In June 1930 and the SS (number - 2,968) in March 1931. He became the adjutant for Theodor Eicke, who was appointed the commandant of Dachau concentration camp in 1933. =Execution of Ernst Röhm= Ernst Röhm (right) with Kurt Daluege (left) and Heinrich Himmler (behind them), August 1933. In early 1934, Hitler and other Nazi leaders became concerned that Ernst Röhm, chief of the SA, was planning a coup d'état. Hitler decided on 21 June that Röhm and the SA leadership had to be eliminated. The purge of the SA leadership and other enemies of the state began on 30 June in an action which became known as the Night of the Long Knives. Eicke, along with hand-chosen members of the SS and Gestapo, assisted Sepp Dietrich's Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler in the arrest and imprisonment of SA commanders, before they were shot. After Röhm was arrested, Hitler gave the order that the imprisoned Röhm was to be executed. Himmler communicated Hitler's order to Eicke. Eicke was told to first give Röhm the choice to commit suicide. Accompanied by Lippert, and SS- Gruppenführer Ernst-Heinrich Schmauser, Eicke travelled to Stadelheim Prison in Munich where Röhm was being held. After telling Röhm that he had forfeited his life and that Hitler had given him a last chance to avoid the consequences, Eicke laid a pistol on a table in Röhm's cell and told him that he had 10 minutes in which to use the weapon to kill himself. Eicke, Lippert and Schmauser left and waited in the corridor for 15 minutes, during which time no shot was heard. Finally, Eicke and Lippert drew their pistols and re- entered Röhm's cell. Both fired and Röhm fell to the floor. One of the two then crossed to Röhm and administered a coup-de-grace. Postwar criminal conviction In 1956, the Munich authorities began an investigation into the Night of the Long Knives and in August arrested Lippert and Sepp Dietrich for their part in it. They were bailed, and the trial itself did not commence until 6 May 1957. They were represented by the lawyer Alfred Seidl who had defended Rudolf Hess at the Nuremberg Trials. Lippert and Dietrich were charged with manslaughter, in Lippert's case for the death of Röhm. Lippert asserted that he had remained outside Röhm's cell, and only Theodor Eicke had gone in. On 10 May, the case was summed-up and the prosecutor demanded a two- year sentence for Lippert. On 14 May, the President of the Court found both Lippert and Dietrich guilty and sentenced both men to 18 months. He described Lippert as \\"filled with a dangerous and unrepentant fanaticism\\". Lippert died on 1 September 1969.

The U.S. Ambassador based at the embassy in Libreville, Gabon is accredited to Sao Tome on a non- resident basis. The Ambassador and Embassy staff make regular visits to the islands. The US State Department has described relations with São Tomé and Príncipe as excellent. History of the relationship São Tomé and Príncipe began developing foreign relations following her independence in 1975. The United States was among the first countries to accredit an ambassador to São Tomé and Príncipe. The first Sao Tomean Ambassador to the United States, resident in New York City, was accredited in 1985. In 1986, Sao Tomean President Manuel Pinto da Costa visited the United States and met with then- Vice President George H.W. Bush. The U.S. government also maintains a number of smaller assistance programs in Sao Tome, administered through non- governmental organizations or the Embassy in Libreville. In 1992, the US federal government broadcaster Voice of America and the government of São Tomé signed a long-term agreement for the establishment of a relay transmitter station in Sao Tome. Voice of America currently broadcasts to much of Africa from this facility. In 2001, President Fradique de Menezes accepted $100,000 from Environmental Remediation, an American oil company involved in offshore exploration, but stated that the money was a legitimate campaign contribution. In August 2002 the BBC reported that São Tomé and Príncipe had agreed to host a US naval base to protect its oil interests. The islands are in a strategic position in the Gulf of Guinea from which the US could monitor the movement of oil tankers and guard oil platforms. Later in 2002, General Carlton W. Fulford, Jr., deputy commander in chief of the United States European Command, visited Sao Tome for planning talks on security. On July 16, 2003 the government of the 140,000 person state was briefly deposed in an attempted military coup. The US State Department deplored the takeover and urged those involved to release the arrested government officials. The coup leaders handed back power a few days later when the president promised to restore democratic rule. In July 2005, a U.S. Coast Guard cutter with a crew of 100 visited São Tomé and Príncipe in a public relations exercise. Carlos Neves, vice-president of the national assembly stated: \\"Unfortunately, Americans are interested in Sao Tome because of oil, but Sao Tome existed before that.\\" In November 2007 the United States and São Tomé and Príncipe signed a Millennium Challenge Corporation Threshold Program agreement worth US$8.66 million, designed to help the country improve its fiscal policy indicators by streamlining business registration processes, tax and customs administration.

She is most well known for her work as the director of the Edinburgh International Film Festival and for producing film adaptions of Irish writer Roddy Doyle's The Barrytown Trilogy: 1991's The Commitments, 1993's The Snapper, and 1996's The Van.  Career  Filmhouse Cinema plaque, Edinburgh As a student at University of Edinburgh, Myles was active in Edinburgh University Film Society. On September 4, 1967, Myles and her then boyfriend, David Will, wrote a letter to the editor of The Scotsman newspaper that was critical of the Edinburgh International Film Festival. The students were invited to work with festival director Murray Grigor, which they did, with great impact, as their focus was on auteurs like Samuel Fuller and other influential American New Wave filmmakers. From Spring 1968 onwards, she began working at Edinburgh International Film Festival, first in programming, and then as a deputy editor of the festival. From 1973 to 1980, Myles was director of the Edinburgh International Film Festival. She was the first woman director of a film festival. In 1979, together with Michael Pye, Lynda Myles coined the term 'the movie brats' which came to define a new generation of American film-makers, nurtured by watching and studying popular films themselves rather than by theatre or industry apprenticeship. It was this generation whose work Myles had championed in her role at the Edinburgh Film Festival. The term went into common usage, and was recently quoted by Stephen Spielberg in several interviews regarding his work. The argument underlying the phrase was made in her and Pye's study of this generation. She was director and curator of film at the Pacific Film Archive, University of California, Berkeley for two years. She was Senior Vice–President at Columbia Pictures. Myles was appointed Commissioning Editor for Drama at the BBC for two years. From 1990 to 1994, Myles was co-executive director of the East-West Producers' Seminar, a training program for young producers in Eastern Europe. In 1991, Myles co- produced the first of three films in Roddy Doyle's The Barrytown Trilogy, The Commitments. She continued to work as an independent producer, making the second and third films in The Barrytown Trilogy, The Snapper and The Van. Myles produced the 1997 film of Simon Donald's play, The Life of Stuff for BBC Films. In 2000, she produced Roddy Doyle's film When Brendan Met Trudy for BBC Films. Myles co-produced Chen Kaige's 2002 film, Killing Me Softly, for the Montecito Picture Company.

Born in Saint- Paul-de-la-Croix, in the area of Bas-Saint-Laurent, Victor-Lévy Beaulieu began primary school at Trois-Pistoles, moving later to Montréal-Nord. He began his public writing career at the Montreal weekly Perspectives, where he served as chronicler for a decade (1966–1976). In 1967, he became a copy writer at La Presse, Petit Journal, Digest Éclair, and finally at Maintenant in 1970. In 1967 he won the Larousse-Hachette Prize thanks to an eighteen-page essay devoted to Victor Hugo. In 1968, he spent a year in Paris, and on his return became a scriptwriter at the Montreal radio station CKLM while resuming his position of chronicler. Also in 1968, he published his first novel Mémoires d'outre-tonneau. This would be the first of a long run: Race de monde (1969) — La nuite de Malcomm Hudd (1969) — Jos Connaissant (1970) — Les Grands Pères (1971) — Un rêve québécois (1972) — Oh Miami Miami Miami (1973) — Don Quichotte de la démanche (1974). Beaulieu served as a teacher of literature at the National Theatre School of Canada from 1972 to 1978, and also wrote for the Radio-Canada broadcasts \\"Documents\\", \\"Petit théâtre\\", \\"Roman\\", \\"La Feuillaison\\". His recent book, James Joyce, l'Irlande et le Québec, has been praised by critics. In 2008 he threatened to burn copies of his entire body of work as a protest against the growth of bilingualism in Quebec and various statements by PQ leader Pauline Marois in support of English classes for francophone schoolchildren. The writer created a stir after describing Canadian Governor-General Michaëlle Jean as a \\"negro queen\\" in L'Aut'Journal magazine. Beaulieu said Ms. Jean was appointed to the post because she was \\"black, young, pretty, ambitious, and because of her husband, certainly a nationalist as well.\\" In an interview with La Presse, the author defended his text, saying he had not intended to be racist. However, his eight references to the \\"reine negre\\" caught the attention of Bloc Québécois Leader Gilles Duceppe and Bloc MP Vivian Barbot. Ms. Barbot told La Presse she found the text insulting and discriminatory, as well as a personal attack on Ms. Jean's character. Mr. Beaulieu wrote of the \\"small, black queen of Radio-Canada\\" and her visit to France, where she spoke about Canadian federalism, but also saluted France for its abolition of slavery in 1847. Mr. Beaulieu noted Ms. Jean, a native of Haiti, came from a country that long suffered the effects of slavery. He also attacked writer Mordecai Richler for the unsympathetic portrayal of French Canadians in his novels.

Coaches USA Basketball Darsch served as an assistant coach of the team representing the US in 1984 at the William Jones Cup competition in Taipei, Taiwan. The team chosen to represent the USA was the team expected to be selected as the national team for the Olympics. This resulted in a very strong team which was able to dominate the competition. In the opening game against Australia, the USA won 82–20. While other games were closer, Italy's 23-point loss to the USA was the closest of the eight games. The USA won all eight games, and won the gold medal. The USA team was led by Cheryl Miller, who led the team in scoring at over 15 points per game, rebounding, free throw percentage, assists and steals. Miller was named to the All-Tournament Team, along with Lynette Woodard, and Denise Curry. Darsch served as the assistant coach to the team representing the US at the World University Games held in Sheffield, England in July 1991. The USA team started out with a very strong offense, scoring over 100 points in each of the first four games. The fourth game was against the USSR, a team often challenging the US for the top spot, but the USA won 106–80 this time. The team fell short of 100 points in the game against Canada, but still won by 18 points. In the quarterfinal game, the USA won easily against Romania 135–53, with Ruthie Bolton scoring 40 points. The game against China was more of a challenge. The USA team shot poorly, hitting only 36% of their shots, but the defense held China to 35% shooting, and won a three-point game, 79–76. The gold medal match was against Spain, but the USA had a 13-point lead at halftime and won 88–62. Bolton was the highest scorer for the USA team with 14 points per game, but Lisa Leslie and Carolyn Jones were close behind with 13 points per game. Nancy Darsch served as an assistant coach to the USA National team which competed at the 1994 FIBA World Championship for Women in Sydney, Australia. The USA team opened strong with large margins of victory in their first five games. The 18-point win over Australia was the smallest margin in that stretch of games. Then the USA team faced Slovakia, and had more of a challenge. The Slovakian team held a lead late in the game, before the USA team made a comeback and won 103–96. The next game was the semifinal against Brazil. The game was close most of the way, but Brazil hit ten free throws in ten attempts in the last minute of the game to edge out the USA 110–107. The USA faced Australia in the bronze medal game, the team they had beaten by 18 points only days before. This game would be much closer, but the USA held off the Aussies to claim the bronze medal. Professional Darsch started her professional coaching career in the WNBA's inaugural season (1997) with the New York Liberty. As the head coach, she led the Liberty to a 17–11 season and the team advanced to the WNBA final against the eventual champion, the Houston Comets. She had the privilege of coaching the Liberty in the first-ever WNBA game against the LA Sparks. Darsch earned her first professional victory in that game with a 65–51 victory on June 21, 1997. In her two seasons with New York, she compiled a 36–24 record.

The castle features in the legend of the Nibelungs.Parent 67. The castle's association with mining led to a legend that King Goldemar, a dwarf or kobold, dwelled there. One version of the story, recorded by Thomas Keightley in 1850, says that King Goldemar lived with Neveling von Hardenberg at the castle. For three years, he brought the inhabitants good luck until a curious man tried to see his footprints by casting tares and ashes about. Goldemar cut the man up, roasted his body, boiled his head and legs, and ate him. He was gone the next day, vowing through a note that the house would be as unlucky as it had been lucky while he lived there.Keightley 256. Notes References * Keightley, Thomas (1850).

Cochin Jews came from India and both groups were part of the development of the British Empire, becoming allied with the British in Burma (now Myanmar). At its height in 1940 the community of Jews in the country stood at 2,500 members.Nathan Katz and Ellen S. Goldberg, \\"The last Jews in India and Burma\\", Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, Jerusalem Letter, n° 101, 15 Avril 1988. During and after the Second World War many Jews left the country, first under pressure from the Japanese occupation, and later because of repression under the newly independent nationalist Burmese government. One synagogue survives in Yangon, the capital, and in the 21st century, it attracts an increasing number of tourists. History The first recorded Jew in the country was Solomon Gabirol, who served as a commander in the army of King Alaungpaya in the 18th century.Secret Yangon II: The Lost Tribe: ThingsAsian But it was in the mid-19th century, during the British colonial period, that Jewish merchants from Iraq and India began establishing sizable communities in Rangoon and Mandalay. The Baghdadi Jews had emigrated from Iraq to escape persecution and being subject to pogroms; they comprised most of the immigrants. Cochin Jews and the Bene Israel came from India. Under British rule, the local Jewish community prospered as merchants developed small businesses, and traders worked in cotton and rice.McDonald-Gibson, Charlotte. \\"Myanmar Jews count on tourism\\", Globe and Mail, 02 December 2006 The Baghdadi Jews established Musmeah Yeshua synagogue in Rangoon; it is the only synagogue still standing in Yangon or the country. It was first built in the 1850s as a small wooden structure, then rebuilt in 1896. The Jewish cemetery, containing 700 graves, is about six miles away. A Jewish school, for children up to middle-school age, had 200 students at its peak in 1910. After that some parents sent their children to secular schools, especially as many Jewish men married Burmese or other ethnic women. In some cases, children were sent to India or Great Britain for higher education. Jews were so established in their major communities that Rangoon and Pathein both elected Jewish mayors in the early 20th century. In this community, a number of the men \\"married out\\", to Burmese women. The Jewish community also established ties with British colonial officers and businessmen. A second synagogue, Beth El, was opened in 1932, reflecting the growth in population. By 1940 the community numbered its peak of 2500 persons. most were involved in business and industry, with \\"some owning ice factories and bottling plants, others dealing in textiles and timber. The rest were primarily customs officials and traders.\\"Naing, Saw Yan.\\"Meet the family behind Burma’s last synagogue\\", Jewish Journal, 28 October 2015; accessed 25 January 2018 In the early part of the twentieth century, various minority groups began to work toward establishing some autonomy, including the Karen people, who were indigenous to the territory. The Burmese were working toward nationalism; they had been later migrants from China in ancient times. With the Japanese invasion in 1942, many Jews fled to India, as their British alliances made the Japanese hostile to them. Though the Japanese were allies of the Nazis, they did not have any particular antipathy towards the Jews. At the same time, they viewed the local Jews with suspicion as a pro-British and a \\"European\\" group. In the drive for independence, the Burmese majority worked to dispossess and defeat the minority groups and strictly limited their rights in the new government. Burma was the first Asian nation to recognize Israel, and it maintains diplomatic relations with the Jewish state. Israel opened its first Diplomatic mission in Yangon in 1953, and in 1957 it became an embassy. Both nations shared a Socialist outlook in their early years and held extensive contacts between their respective leaders.Fredman Cernea, Ruth. Almost Englishmen: Baghdadi Jews in British Burma, New York: Lexington Books, 2006 (paperback), p. 122 Following nationalization of businesses in 1964, the remaining Jewish community suffered further decline.

Since the late 20th century, some of the Mizo people, who are ethnically descended from Tibet and live in the north of Burma, on the Indian border, have identified as Jews. They have taken on the belief that they descend from the lost tribe of Manasseh, based on certain traditions that are similar to those of Judaism. Some have converted to Judaism and immigrated to Israel. Their settlers in Israel have embraced Orthodox Judaism (they had to convert to Orthodoxy to be considered citizens) and have been settled in Judea, Samaria, and Gush Katif. They are known as the Bnei Menashe. =21st-century Yangon Jewish community= Musmeah Yeshua synagogue bimah As of 2002, 20 Jews remained in Yangon, the capital city. Many Burmese Jews have immigrated to Israel over the years, after India achieved independence. The local Jews use the Musmeah Yeshua Synagogue, but it rarely draws the required quorum of men for a full religious service. Often, employees of the Israeli embassy help maintain regular services; Moses Samuels, a native-born descendant of Jewish immigrants from Iraq, took on his father's role as Trustee of the synagogue to keep it up, along with the cemetery. His son Sammy Samuels was also committed to the future of the synagogue. The senior Samuels has given numerous tours to visitors. In 2011 the congregation had 45 Jews.\\"Moses dreams of reversing Jewish exodus\\", Mizzima In 2007 the US-ASEAN Council for Business and Technology, the US-ASEAN Business Council's 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization, obtained a license from the United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to raise funds for a humanitarian project: the maintenance and restoration of the Musmeah Yeshua Synagogue in Yangon. (The license was needed to operate outside the US economic sanctions against the government of Myanmar because of its human rights abuses; sanctions were lifted in 2012.) The Council planned to provide for the synagogue's monthly expenses; complete restoration and maintenance of the synagogue; and assist the synagogue to purchase and establish a new cemetery. On December 8, 2013, an interfaith event attended by the Myanmar Presidential Minister U Aung Min, US Ambassador Derek Mitchell, Israeli Ambassador Hagay Moshe Behar, the Yangon Religious Council, and other guests celebrated the completion of the restoration and establishing the synagogue as self-supporting. They credited anthropologist Ruth Cernea, who wrote a history of the Jewish community in Rangoon; Laura Hudson of the Council, and Stuart Spencer, a member of the synagogue's diaspora, as three leaders of this project.

They were first established in 1882 with the Kingdom of Serbia. From 1918 to 2006, the United States maintained relations with the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (later Serbia and Montenegro), of which Serbia is considered the legal successor. At the end of the 19th century, the United States sought to take advantage of the Ottoman Empire's retreat from the Balkans by establishing diplomatic relations with the region's newly emerged nation states, among which was Serbia. The two countries were allies during World War I. After the war, Serbia united with Montenegro and territories previously held by Austria-Hungary to a create a unified South Slavic state that would come to be known as Yugoslavia. The country had diplomatic relations with the United States up to the start of World War II. During World War II in Yugoslavia, the United States supported the Serbian royalist Chetniks over their rivals, the communist Partisans. The Chetniks ultimately lost out to the Partisans and Yugoslavia became a single- party communist state with Partisan leader Josip Broz Tito at its head. In the immediate aftermath of the war, Yugoslavia and the United States had little diplomatic relations. The end of the war also resulted in the mass emigration of refugees from Yugoslavia, many of whom were Serbs that ended up moving to the United States. This helped create the first major Serbian diaspora in the United States. Some of the Serbian refugees who settled in the United States after World War II were anti-communist exiles who attempted to undermine Tito during the Cold War, using the United States as a venue for their anti- communist aims. During the breakup of Yugoslavia, the United States engaged in both combative and economic conflict, particularly with Serbia, known at the time as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (one of socialist Yugoslavia's successor states). The United States imposed sanctions and spearheaded a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999. During this period, another wave of Serbian emigration ensued, and many Serbian refugees moved to the United States. In the 2000s, diplomatic relations between the United States and Yugoslavia were restored, but were changed when Montenegro seceded in 2006, after which Serbia was the successor state to continue relations previously held by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia in February 2008, a move which the US recognized. History =Relations between the Kingdom of Serbia and the United States= Mihajlo Pupin (seated first from right), honorary consul of Serbia in the United States, at the first meeting of the NACA (1915) Diplomatic relations between the then-Kingdom of Serbia and the United States were established in the 19th century. In 1879, the Serbian Consulate-General in New York was opened. On February 3, 1882, the Serbian Parliament adopted a contract and Convention of diplomatic relations between the Kingdom of Serbia and the United States, given by King Milan Obrenović. The United States Senate adopted both documents on July 5, 1882 without debate or amendments. On November 10, 1882, Eugene Schuyler became the first United States ambassador in Serbia. =Relations between the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and the United States= US role in defining borders of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes After the participation of the United States in World War I, US president Woodrow Wilson issued his Fourteen Points as a list of prioritized negotiations to end the war. Wilson's tenth point asserted that the peoples living in Austria Hungary should independently decide their fates after the war, directly contradicting the United Kingdom's post-war vision of a surviving Austria Hungary. Wilson's eleventh point more specifically involved Serbia, explicitly stating that Serbia be guaranteed open access to the Adriatic Sea. During the negotiations for the Treaty of Versailles, the United States were represented by a delegation which was heavily involved in defining the borders for the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. During the process of defining new borders, The Kingdom of Serbia selected Jovan Cvijić to show maps to the American delegation in an effort to persuade them to endorse the acquisition of Baranya, east Banat, and other regions previously ruled by Austria Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania. Likewise, the American delegation also faced the lobby of Serbia's neighboring countries, and for the most part endorsed the allocation of Baranya to Hungary and most of Banat to Romania, in contrast to Cvijić's proposals. Cultural exchange King Alexander I of Yugoslavia on the cover of Time on February 11, 1929 Serbian students began studying in US after the WWI. For that purposes International Serbian Educational Committee was founded by professor Rosalie Slaughter Morton in 1919, and it was soon made official by the Ministry of Education. Morton was the first woman professor of gynecology in New York and she sought to \\"pay her respect, gratitude and admiration\\" for Serbia's role in the war. Total of 61 students (mostly from modern-day Serbia) were enrolled in the first generation. Various American colleges were made available for free studying to Serb students as a sign of good will and partnership. Such actions were only one aspect of generally good relations between the two nations on all fields at the time. American films made up over 50 percent of foreign showings in Yugoslav cinemas in the 1930s, with Charlie Chaplin being a favourite of the Belgrade public. During the same period, Jazz music became popular and several American musicians played in Belgrade, such as Arthur Rubinstein. =US support of Serbian monarchists during World War II= During World War II in Yugoslavia, the United States initially supported the royal government of Yugoslavia. When the Nazis invaded Yugoslavia in the spring of 1941, the United States decisively supported the Chetniks in the first years of the war. This support took place in the form of extensive clandestine relations between the Office of Strategic Services and Chetniks with William Donovan's administration. Such cooperation was highlighted by complex operations such as Operation Halyard, in which several hundred American pilots were rescued by Chetniks. A memorial plaque for Operation Halyard in Pranjani, Serbia. However, OSS support for the Chetniks was compromised by the United Kingdom's MI6 policy of favoring the Yugoslav Partisans over the Chetniks. In 1943, the US government's support for the Chetniks over the Yugoslav Partisans was such that president Franklin D. Roosevelt discussed with Winston Churchill in a private conversation that he imagined that Yugoslavia's boundaries would be completely redrawn into three separate states, with Peter Karađorđević Jr. being the monarch of an independent Serbian kingdom at the end of the war. The USAF and the British RAF began bombing Belgrade indiscriminately in April 1944 when they thought that Nazi occupation could not be removed by home-grown resistance alone. The United States intelligence circles gradually conceded its influence on Yugoslav guerrilla operations to the British. At the end of the war, President Harry S. Truman dedicated a Legion of Merit to Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović, but the award wasn't revealed publicly until 2005. =Cold War relations (1945–1991)= After the end of World War II, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRJ) was formed. One of the first diplomatic contacts made with the new communist government was the US Department of State's request for the US Army to testify at the Mihailović trial.U.S. Defends Mihailovic in Note to Yugoslavs, The Milwaukee Sentinel - April 3, 1946. However, the request was shunned and early relations between the United States and the government of Josip Broz Tito became strained, as American diplomats were furious over Mihailović's execution in 1946.Walter R. Roberts, Tito, Mihailović and the Allies 1941-1945, Rutgers University Press, page 307Martin, David.

Hoover Institution Publication, volume 191. Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University, 1978. Relations degraded even further a month later, when two USAF C-47 Skytrain cargo aircraft were shot down over Yugoslavia in the space of two weeks. More USAF aircraft were shot down over Yugoslavia up to 1948. As a result, U.S. senator Thomas Dodd staunchly opposed American financial aid to Tito's government, even saying that \\"Tito had bloodied hands.\\" In one of Josip Broz Tito's early visits to the United States, protesters in San Pedro drowned an effigy of him. Following the Second World War into 1961, the United States operated a Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) and many Yugoslavian Officers received American training. Along with receiving many American weapons, Yugoslavia received $600 million USD in military aid. The Apollo 11 crew in Belgrade (1969) by Stevan Kragujević The communist governments in Europe deferred to Stalin and rejected Marshall Plan aid from the United States in 1947. At first, Tito went along and rejected the Marshall plan. However, in 1948 Tito broke decisively with Stalin on other issues, making Yugoslavia an independent communist state. Yugoslavia then requested American aid. American leaders were internally divided, but finally agreed and began sending money on a small scale in 1949, and on a much larger scale 1950-53. The American aid was not part of the Marshall Plan. Yugoslavia began opening more diplomatic dialogue to western nations after the Tito–Stalin split, which assured that Yugoslavia was not to become a member of the Warsaw Pact. Pan American World Airways launched direct flights from New York to Belgrade in 1963. On January 1, 1967, Yugoslavia was the first communist state to open its borders to all foreign visitors and abolish visa requirements. The regular commercial air travel between the United States and Yugoslavia then saw the launching of JAT Yugoslav Airlines flights to the United States, effectively competing with Pan Am. Trade opportunities reopened between the United States and Yugoslavia, and American businesses began exporting to Yugoslavia. Likewise, by the 1980s Yugoslavia was even exporting many of its manufactured automobiles from Zastava Automobili's assembly line in Kragujevac to the United States. U.S. president Jimmy Carter discussed issues regarding Palestine and Egypt with Tito and referred to him as a \\"great world leader\\". Subsequently, the Reagan administration presented their policies towards Yugoslavia in a Secret Sensitive 1984 National Security Decision Directive NSDD 133. \\"U.S. Policy towards Yugoslavia.\\" A censored version declassified in 1990 elaborated on NSDD 54 on Eastern Europe, issued in 1982. The latter advocated \\"efforts to expand U.S. economic relations with Yugoslavia in ways which will benefit both countries\\" serving as \\"a useful reminder to countries in Eastern Europe of the advantages of independence from Moscow\\". Serbian anti-communists in the United States For much of the socialist period, the United States was a haven for many Serbian anti- communists living outside Yugoslavia. On 20 June 1979, a Serbian nationalist named Nikola Kavaja hijacked American Airlines Flight 293 from New York City with the intention of crashing the Boeing 707 into League of Communists of Yugoslavia headquarters in Belgrade. The aircraft, however, landed in Shannon, Ireland, where Kavaja were arrested. Nikola Kavaja hijacked American Airlines Flight 293 on June 20, 1979 with the intention of crashing it into the League of Communists building in Belgrade. A group of six Serbian nationalists, among them Boško Radonjić, placed a home-made bomb in the home of the Yugoslav consulate in Chicago in 1975. Radonjić later became the leader of the Westies gang in New York City, where he participated in organized crime and racketeering. He eventually became one of the most feared gangsters in the New York City underworld, and developed extensive friendships with Vojislav Stanimirović, John Gotti and the Gambino family. After Sammy Gravano turned John Gotti in to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in December 1990, Radonjić was highly suspected to have attempted to fix the trial on John Gotti's behalf. As a result of this, Radonjić was arrested on December 1999 during a spectacular rerouted plane going to Cuba to a lockdown at Miami International Airport when he was tracked down by the FBI. He was arrested in the United States again in January 2000 for further investigation of the 1992 Gotti trial. Upon release in 2001, he left the United States and moved back to Serbia where he lived until his death in 2011. He was also an admirer and long-time friend of Radovan Karadžić until the latter went into hiding in 1996. In the 1980s, Vojislav Šešelj taught political science at the University of Michigan after being expelled by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in 1981. In June 1989, he traveled to the United States again to meet with Momčilo Đujić in San Marcos, California, where Đujić named him Chetnik Vojvoda (duke in Serbian). He went on to form the Serbian Radical Party in 1991 and was accused by the ICTY tribunal of leading the Beli Orlovi militants in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in war-state Republic of Serbian Krajina. Radovan Karadžić pursued post-graduate medical studies at Columbia University from 1974 to 1975, See also: but did so without any specific political agenda at the time being; he later became the war-time president of the Republika Srpska during the Bosnian War and subsequently went into hiding in Serbia until his capture in 2008 for ICTY charges of war crimes and genocide. =Deteriorating relations and war with FR Yugoslavia (1991–2000)= Seated from left to right: Slobodan Milošević, Alija Izetbegović, Franjo Tuđman signing the Dayton Peace Accords at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base on November 21, 1995. The first form of sanctions initiated by the US against Yugoslavia took place already from 1990 as the Nickels Amendment, which was sponsored by senators Don Nickles and Bob Dole. The amendment was passed due to concerns about Albanians being arrested in Kosovo. Congressional Record 101st Congress (1989-1990): Foreign Operations Conference Sends Strong Message. October 27, 1990 The amendment officially came into legal effect from May 6, 1992; although it applied only to $5 million-worth of US foreign aid, it was reported as instrumental in denying SFR Yugoslavia its last application for IMF loans before its breakup and hyperinflation episode. The breakup of Yugoslavia began in 1992, the territories consisting of Serbia, Montenegro, and Kosovo composed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In the midst of the Yugoslav Wars, the United States as well as an overwhelming majority of states from the United Nations severed economic ties and imposed sanctions on FR Yugoslavia on May 30, 1992. The Panić–Ćosić–Milošević triangle and the United States The Yugoslav government of the newly formed FR Yugoslavia (successor to SFR Yugoslavia) ended up having three ideologically-opposed leaders occupying executive positions. From 1992, while Slobodan Milošević was the president of the Federal Republic of Serbia, national theorist Dobrica Ćosić was named President of FR Yugoslavia. Meanwhile, Milan Panić, a business magnate based in Newport Beach, California, accepted Milošević's invitation to be Prime Minister. Panić was subsequently elected as Prime Minister in the 1992 Yugoslav parliamentary elections. The United States did not revoke Panić's citizenship even though his occupation of an executive position in the Yugoslav government clearly contradicted the United States Constitution.Who is this man Milan Panic?: How did an American millionaire become Prime Minister of Yugoslavia? And what's in it for him? Keith Botsford reports - Voices. The Independent (July 23, 1992). Nevertheless, Panić would become a person of interest in US diplomatic circles, given his business and residence backgrounds. At a CSCE meeting in Helsinki in July 1992, US Secretary of State James Baker abruptly dismissed Panić's appeal to reduce the sanctions to Yugoslavia, even after an agreement (between Panić, Milošević, and Dušan Mitević) was reached by which Milošević would resign in return for sanction- relief. This ended up severely damaging Panić's unique diplomatic position internationally, as well as his standing in Yugoslavia. The Los Angeles Times published an article which described Panić as a doubtful upholder of potential American-Yugoslavian peacemaking, McManus, Tuohy. Los Angeles Times: Allies OK Naval Moves to Press Harder on Serbia - July 11, 1992 when in fact, many years later made to be known, Panić was actually invited by Baker in the first place rather than voluntarily coming to Helsinki. Panić and former US ambassador to Yugoslavia John Douglas Scanlan cooperated on a deep level Schudel, Matt. Washington Post: John D. Scanlan; U.S. Diplomat in Eastern Europe - November 25, 2007 in a campaign to challenge conservative politicians which echoed Baker's disapproval of giving Yugoslavia sanctions-relief in return for Milošević's planned resignation. One of Panić's advisors, academic Ljubiša Rakić, was dispatched to explain to Larry Eagleburger that the H.W. Bush administration was mistaken in seeing Panić as a Milošević puppet. Eagleburger replied, \\"Don't worry, we are going to do our own thing\\". Slobodan Milošević, President of Serbia, with Bill Clinton, President of the United States, Warren Christopher and Richard Holbrooke The three-pronged government lasted only from May to December 1992, as Panić and Ćosić decided to challenge Milošević in institutionally-revised elections in December that same year. The December election ended up as a failure for the opposition to Milošević, as Ćosić pulled out of the campaign in the last moment due to health problems. Multiple politicians of the opposition parties criticized the US-instigated fossil-fuel sanctions in the midst of a cold 1992-93 winter, saying that they actually further helped sympathy for Milošević and not against him. Lewis, Paul. Washington Post: Yugoslavs Face Hard Winter as the Blockade Bites. October 29, 1992 Post-Dayton lull and US economic influence in Yugoslavia (1995–1998) On November 21, 1995, Serbian president Slobodan Milošević travelled to the United States to sign the Dayton Peace Accords with Croatian president Franjo Tuđman and Bosnian president Alija Izetbegović near Dayton, Ohio. Months later, sanctions against Yugoslavia were finally lifted in October 1996. In 1997, a group of 17 economists wrote a letter titled \\"Program Radikalnih Ekonomskih Reformi u Jugoslaviji\\", advocating liberal macroeconomic policy by creating alarming predictions of the Yugoslav economy from 1998 to 2010. Naša Borba: Razradjen Program Radikalnih Ekonomskih Reformi u Jugoslaviji September 9, 1997 Not by coincidence, the letter was first published by B92, arguably the most West-friendly media outlet in Yugoslavia at the time. This would be the base for what would become a highly controversial political party in Serbia, G17 Plus, which began as an NGO funded by the National Endowment for Democracy. McCarthy, Paul. NED: Hearing of the Commission on Security & Cooperation in Europe \\"The Milosevic Regime Versus Serbian Democracy and Balkan Stability\\" - December 10, 1998 The original writers of the 1997 letter subsequently divided, as some either shunned or even criticized G17's fundamentals, whereas others would end up occupying positions in the post-Milošević government from 2000. NATO bombing of Yugoslavia Smoke from bombed Novi Sad's refinery in 1999. The United States reinstated sanctions against Yugoslavia in March 1998 when the Kosovo War started. New York Times: US and allies set sanctions on Yugoslavia. March 10, 1998 (Archives) Shortly after the controversies at Račak and Rambouillet, American diplomat Richard Holbrooke traveled to Belgrade in March 1999 to deliver the final ultimatum requesting entry of UN forces into Kosovo. Milošević rejected the ultimatum, and the United States completely severed ties with Yugoslavia on March 23, 1999. Bill Clinton became the first president to declare war while bypassing a Congressional majority. The establishment of the bombing campaign was contested by one of the tightest votings (213-213) in the entire history of the House of Representatives.New York Times (April 29, 1999) \\"House G.O.P. Adds Billions for Military In Balkans Package\\" The United States declared war on Yugoslavia on March 24, 1999 to take part in Operation Allied Force led by U.S. general Wesley Clark. Out of all the territories in Yugoslavia at the time, Serbia was bombed the most due to its concentration of military targets.NATO's role in relation to the conflict in Kosovo, NATO website, July 15, 1999. As a result of Slobodan Milošević granting entry to KFOR in Kosovo, the war against Yugoslavia ceased on June 10, 1999. =Post-war relations= Overthrow of Milošević and aftermath (2000–2008) Vojislav Koštunica, President of FR Yugoslavia, and George W. Bush, President of the United States, in the White House, 2001. A group named Otpor!, originally formed by students in 1998 with the financial assistance of USAID, International Republican Institute, and NED, was one of multiple significant participants in the Bulldozer Revolution, from which Milošević was overthrown. USAID donated over $30 million for Otpor to \\"purchase cell phones and computers for DOS's leadership and to recruit and train an army of 20,000 election monitors\\" as well as to supplement them with \\"a sophisticated marketing campaign with posters, badges and T-shirts.\\"Gallagher, T., 2005. The Balkans in the New Millennium: In the Shadow of War and Peace. London: Routledge. p.112. After the Bulldozer Revolution on October 5, 2000, the United States reestablished a diplomatic presence in Belgrade. In 2013, the Associated Press published an article which reported that a CIA operative, Francis Archibald, participated in the organization of the October 5 coup and that the overthrow was \\"regarded inside the CIA as a blueprint for running a successful peaceful covert action\\". Berman, Taylor. Gawker: CIA's New Chief Spy Outed on Twitter - May 8, 2013 Sanctions against FR Yugoslavia were lifted in January 2001. The United States under the Bush administration denied giving any aid to Yugoslavia even several months after UN sanctions were lifted before Vojislav Koštunica promised to cooperate with demands from The Hague regarding the Slobodan Milošević trial. Sun Sentinel: Bush Urges Leader's Trial. May 10, 2001 Joe Biden, Vice President of the United States, and Boris Tadić, President of Serbia, in Belgrade, 2009. After Milošević was arrested by the police under the new Yugoslav government, the United States pressured Yugoslavia to extradite Milošević to the ICTY or lose financial aid from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. In March 2001, American economist Joseph Stiglitz traveled to Belgrade to talk to a prominent Democratic Opposition leader, Zoran Đinđić, about the potential consequences of IMF-sponsored austerity. On June 25, 2001, Stiglitz published a paper, \\"Serbia's Advantages in Coming Late\\", about the necessity for Serbia not to rush privatization and not to pursue \\"shock therapy\\", which was the established macroeconomic advise of the Bretton Woods institutions. Stiglitz, Joseph. Project Syndicate: Serbia’s Advantages in Coming Late. June 25, 2001 Đinđić, however, did not live long to analyze the advice of the Bretton Woods institutions or the anti-austerity plan of Stiglitz, as he was assassinated on March 12, 2003. This accumulated to a crescendo when G17 Plus got into an intense standoff with the Serbian government, composed mostly by DOS, due to the fact that G17 Plus continuously lobbied for the dissolution of the state union of Serbia and Montenegro. Jovanovic, Igor. SETimes: Sukob demokratskih snaga oko guvernera Narodne banke Srbije. July 24, 2003 Later, in May 2006, Montenegro declared independence from the Serbo-Montenegrin state union; the United States immediately respected the results and urged the new government in Podgorica to keep close ties with Serbia. The United States recognized Serbia as the official successor state of the Serbia and Montenegro and the preceding Yugoslav state. Outside of fiscal policy, American influence was evident in executive positions. In September 2002, it was announced that the Military Court in Belgrade was to press charges against Momčilo Perišić, who was the vice president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia at the time, for espionage in the favour of the CIA.B92 (Serbian): Perišić optužen za špijunažu September 30, 2002 The trial never took place, although upon his release from The Hague on February 28, 2013, it was announced by Perišić's lawyer Novak Lukić that his client was \\"ready to be judged\\" on the same 2002 accusations of espionage. S Media: Nema opuštanja: Momčilo Perišić spreman za suđenje za špijunažu u korist SAD March 4, 2013 As of 2015 no further investigation has taken place. Crisis in 2008 The evacuated embassy of the United States in Belgrade after the 2008 Serbia protests. On February 15, 2008, it was announced that the pro-Western Boris Tadić won the 2008 Serbian presidential election. The 2008 elections were particularly important to Serbia's relations with the United States, as the main challenging party which lost the election, SRS, disintegrated when Tomislav Nikolić split with Vojislav Šešelj over integration into the European Union. When Nikolić split from SRS and began pursuing a pro-European profile (a reversal from SRS's eurosceptic position), he was being advised by American lobbying firm Quinn Gillespie & Associates. Only a few days after this election result, the declaring of independence by Kosovo on February 17, 2008 spurred off widespread unrest in Serbia, during which the embassy of the United States was evacuated and then torched by a mob. One man of Serbian nationality was killed inside of the embassy during the unrest. Serbia temporarily withdrew its ambassador from Washington, D.C., but the U.S. embassy in Belgrade was closed only for several days. Ambassador Cameron Munter said that no degrading of relations were expected regardless of the unrest. SNS-era (2012–) On April 19, 2012, shortly before the 2012 Serbian parliamentary and presidential election, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani traveled to Belgrade to attend a news conference with the SNS candidate for Belgrade mayor, Aleksandar Vučić.SRB Time.mk - Enovine - Djulijani nije Amerikanac! (serbian) - April 20, 2012 The US Embassy to Serbia released a statement saying that Giuliani's appearance did not represent the United States endorsing any candidate in Serbia's parliamentary upcoming election. The incumbent Belgrade mayor at the time, Dragan Đilas, slammed the conference which Giuliani attended, telling press that \\"Giuliani should not speak about Belgrade's future as a man who supported the bombing of Serbia.\\"B92- eng - Belgrade mayor accuses Giuliani of \\"supporting bombing\\" - April 20, 2012 Aleksandar Vučić, President of Serbia, and Mike Pompeo, United States Secretary of State, in Washington, 2020. The 2012 Serbian parliamentary and presidential elections both took place on May 6, 2012. The result ended with the removal of the incumbent DS-led coalition from the parliament majority, and the loss of incumbent Boris Tadić to Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) candidate Tomislav Nikolić. On July 3, 2012, the US government sent Philip Reeker to Belgrade, who participated in an undisclosed discussion with Mlađan Dinkić of the United Regions of Serbia party in his first day there. Reeker subsequently talked to Čedomir Jovanović, Ivica Dačić, Aleksandar Vučić, and Tomislav Nikolić. The contents of the discussions were not disclosed to journalists, as they were repeatedly shunned when asking about Reeker's mission in Serbia. Reeker's meetings with the leaders of various parties shortly after the election resulted in speculation on the United States overtly forming a coalition in the Serbian government. In one instance, professor Predrag Simić from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Political Sciences claimed that Reeker's visit to Belgrade in July 2012 was an attempt to create a parliamentary coalition between Democratic Party and SNS, as opposed to the SNS-SPS bloc which had been composed by the election results. In spite of the claim, the victorious SNS kept SPS as a coalition partner. However, United Regions of Serbia ultimately joined the ruling coalition, Politika: Sporazum koalicija SNS-a, SPS-a i URS-a . July 10, 2012. Accessed February 8, 2019. whose leader Dinkić was the first party leader Reeker spoke to in his July 2012 trip. Overall, the election ultimately resulted in the defeat of DS as they became the largest parliamentary opposition to SNS. The newly elected government ultimately continued Euro-Atlantic integration programs pursued by the Tadić administration. According to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, only 20% of Serbs approved of U.S. leadership, with 57% disapproving and 22% uncertain, the fifth-lowest rating for any surveyed European country that year.U.S. Global Leadership Project Report - 2012 Gallup Ahead of the 2016 presidential election in the United States, Vučić attended the Clinton Foundation's Global Initiative Annual Meeting held in September 2016.

In the meeting, Vučić participated in a discussion about the relationship between Serbs and Bosniaks in Bosnia and Herzegovina with the former mayor of Srebrenica, Ćamil Duraković. The discussion was moderated by Bill Clinton. Subsequently, former Trump campaign consultant Roger Stone alleged on an InfoWars episode that the government of Serbia paid $2 million for attending the Clinton Foundation's meeting. Before his appearance at the Clinton Foundation forum, Vučić was interviewed by Gorislav Papić from Serbian TV show Oko (\\"eye\\" in Serbian). When Papić asked Vučić why he appeared in the Clinton Foundation meeting in September 2016, Vučić asked Papić, \\"what, you want to get into a conflict with Hillary Clinton?\\" Vučić insisted that he was neutral in the US election in spite of his appearance at the Clinton Foundation meeting, adding that \\"Serbia is a small country to take sides of decisions made by Americans\\". Aleksandar Vučić, President of Serbia (left), Donald Trump, President of the United States (middle), and Avdullah Hoti, Prime Minister of Kosovo (right), singing the 2020 Kosovo and Serbia economic agreement in the White House On October 4, 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Richard Grenell as the Special Presidential Envoy for Serbia and Kosovo Peace Negotiations. After months of diplomatic talks, on January 20, 2020 Serbia and Kosovo agreed to restore flights between Belgrade and Pristina for the first time in over 20 years. On September 4, 2020 the President of Serbia, Aleksandar Vučić, and the Prime Minister of Kosovo, Avdullah Hoti, signed an agreement on the normalisation of economic relations between Serbia and Kosovo at the White House. The deal will encompass freer transit, including by rail and road, while both parties agreed to work with the Export–Import Bank of the United States and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation and to join the Mini Schengen Zone, but the agreement also included the relocation of the Serbian embassy to Jerusalem, as well as, and mutual recognition between Israel and Kosovo.

Trade and investment The Fiat 500L is manufactured in Serbia and sold in the United States as well as around the world. Serbia's strongest exports to the United States include Fiat automobiles manufactured in Kragujevac. Fiat purchased Zastava Automobili in 2008 and subsequently managed the factory in Kragujevac so that it would produce new Fiat automobiles as opposed to Zastava models (the last Zastavas were produced in 2008); in May 2013 alone, 3,000 Fiat 500L units were shipped from Serbia to Baltimore for sale in the United States. The Fiat 500L is the first automobile to have been exported from Serbia to the United States since the Zastava Koral before 1992, and is proving to be a popular model with a large amount of advertising in the United States.

Transportation Air Serbia at New York JFK International Airport in 2016. In 1963, Pan American World Airways launched flights from New York JFK International Airport to Belgrade. From the 1970s to 1992, JAT Yugoslav Airlines flew from Belgrade to New York, Chicago, Cleveland, and Los Angeles using Boeing 707 and McDonnell Douglas DC-10 equipment. With the breakup of Yugoslavia, flights between Belgrade and the United States were not re-instated until 2003, when the government of Serbia and Montenegro granted Uzbekistan Airways rights to operate non-stop passenger flights between Belgrade and New York with their Boeing 767 aircraft. The flights continued to and originated from Tashkent International Airport. The codeshare flights with Uzbekistan Airways were short-lived. On June 23, 2016 Serbian flag carrier Air Serbia launched its first flight from Belgrade to New York JFK International Airport.

Following the Battle of Pea Ridge, Arkansas and the resulting Confederate withdrawal from northern Arkansas, recruiters were dispatched throughout Missouri in an attempt to rebuild the Confederate forces. Southern guerrillas aided the recruiters and often fought alongside them.Banasik, Michael E, Embattled Arkansas: The Prairie Grove Campaign of 1862, Broadfoot Publishing Company, 1996, pages 116-118 Guerrilla warfare plagued Missouri from the start of the conflict in Missouri, but intensified in early 1862 as the weather warmed.Nichols, Bruce, Guerrilla Warfare in Civil War Missouri, 1862, McFarland & Company, 2004, page 60 To combat the growing guerrilla menace General Henry W. Halleck issued General Order Number 2 on March 13 which warned Missourians \\"warned that if they join any guerrilla band they will not, if captured, be treated as ordinary prisoners of war, but will be hung as robbers and murderers\\".The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Series I, Volume 8, page 612 Confederate President Jefferson Davis responded on April 21, 1862 attempting to legitimize guerrilla warfare by authorizing commissions for those forming bands of \\"partisan rangers\\". but this was not accepted by the United States authorities. On May 29 Brigadier General John Schofield responded with General Order No. 18 to the Missouri State Militia which read in part:The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Series 1, Volume 18, pages 402-3 > When caught in arms, engaged in their unlawful warfare, they will be shot > down upon the spot. As guerrilla warfare and recruiting increased, and as the state had been stripped of nearly all but the new volunteer Missouri State Militia Cavalry regiments, guerrilla action and Confederate recruiting began to press Missouri harder throughout the summer. The Missouri State Militia commanders and Union Volunteers began to converge on Joseph C. Porter's recruiters and associated guerrillas, fighting small action at Vassar Hill on July 19, Florida on July 22, and Santa Fe on July 24. Meanwhile, on July 22 General Schofield with the aid of Missouri's provisional Governor Hamilton Rowan Gamble ordered a compulsory militia enrollment, the Enrolled Missouri Militia, in an effort to raise a sufficient body of men for community defense.The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Series I, Vol. 13, page 12 Schofield issued General Orders No. 19 requiring all able bodied loyal men to enroll in the militia and the disloyal to register stating their sympathies. While these orders did raise a militia force for garrison duty and local policing that freed the Missouri State Militia for active pursuit of guerrillas and recruiters, the policies also forced those of Southern loyalties to choose sides. Thousands chose the brush, guerrilla bands, or to seek out recruiters to join the Southern army.Nichols, Bruce, Guerrilla Warfare in Civil War Missouri, 1862, McFarland & Company, 2004, pages 103-105 Joseph C. Porter and John A. Poindexter's Confederate recruiting commands would immediately benefit from the order as Southern sympathizer flocked to their banners. In the meantime it would be several weeks before this newest Missouri militia would be ready to take the field. The Brown's Spring Skirmish In Jefferson City on July 27 Colonel Odon Guitar of the 9th Missouri State Militia Cavalry (9th MSM Cavalry) received instructions to reinforce Lieutenant-Colonel Shaffer in Columbia with two companies, which he did. Guitar also received intelligence that Porter and guerrilla leader Alvin Cobb were encamped together only 11 miles north of Fulton at Brown's Spring. Guitar selected a force of 100 men of the 9th MSM Cavalry and a section of artillery from the 3rd Indiana Battery, crossed the Missouri River and proceeded to Fulton where he was joined by 54 men of Capt. Duffield's 3rd Iowa Cavalry. With these he advanced to Brown's Spring. A small skirmish ensued nearby and Guitar found the camp recently abandoned. Learning that Lieutenant Colonel Schaeffer's had arrived nearby with 500 men, Guitar camped for the night. Opposing forces =Union= :Guitar's Column *9th Missouri State Militia Cavalry (Cos.

Rather than avoiding battle, Porter prepared an ambush along the banks of Auxvasse Creek. On the morning of July 28 Guitar advanced along the Creek and was joined by Shaffer's much larger force for a combined force of 733 men. Guitar attempted to trap Porter by sending Shaffer east across the creek in a flanking movement with 464 men. Simultaneously Guitar advanced west of the creek with 269 men, but too rapidly for Shaffer's wing to complete their movement in time.Banasik, Michael E, Embattled Arkansas: The Prairie Grove Campaign of 1862, Broadfoot Publishing Company, 1996 Porter's force awaited Guitar in ambush, concealed in trees and brush adjacent to the path. The rebels unleashed two devastating volleys into the federals before they could react. Guitar ordered his men to dismount and to take cover in the woods while bringing his cannon forward. Porter lacked artillery and the federals hoped that their artillery would soon unnerve and dislodge Porter's men. After an hour Porter declared, \\"Boys, we can't stand this, we shall have to charge them—Forward! Charge!\\"Banasik, Michael E, Embattled Arkansas: The Prairie Grove Campaign of 1862, Broadfoot Publishing Company, 1996, pages 129-130 The Confederates shot down the gunners and overran at least one of the two pieces, driving the Federals back in disorder. At this stage Shaffer's force arrived on the field having countermarched after hearing volley fire and artillery. A company surged forward retaking the guns and sending the rebels reeling back to their original positions. Shaffer's men dismounted and the exchange of fire continued. After several hours, Porter's men were short of ammunition and the order was given to withdraw. Standing or leaving cover to withdraw exposed the men and many Confederates reported that this was when many of their casualties occurred. The exhausted Union troops did not pursue immediately and the Confederates were able to withdraw. Casualties Federal casualties were considerable with 13 killed and 55 wounded.The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies Series, 1 Volume 13, page 189 Confederate casualties can only be estimated. Setting the lower bound is a tabulation in the Fulton Telegraph of August 1 listing the names of those Confederates known dead, captured and wounded as well as mentioning several wounded refusing to give their names.Mudd, Joseph A., With Porter in North Missouri Guitar's report of the engagement claimed to have killed 52 and wounded from 125-150, but these figures are not supported by other accounts.The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Series 1 Volume 13, page 189 Participant and later author Joseph A. Mudd also quotes a contemporary Shelby County, Missouri history that said the \\"Confederates reported a loss of eleven killed and twenty-one severely wounded\\".Mudd, Joseph A., With Porter in North Missouri, page 181 Aftermath Guitar's force was too exhausted from the chase and battle to pursue Porter's fleeing command. Porter's threat to Northeast Missouri would end in defeat on August 6 at the Battle of Kirksville. Porter would order his command to scatter and find their way South to the Confederate Army. Guitar became ill shortly after Moore's Mill and was unable to join in the victory at Kirksville, although some of his force was present. Odon Guitar's efforts in this battle and his pursuit and destruction of Poindexter's force several weeks later would result in Guitar's promotion to brigadier general of Missouri State Militia.Christensen, Lawrence O., Dictionary of Missouri Biography University of Missouri Press, 1999 , pages 357-6 Southern recruiting efforts in the northern portion of the state would never recover.

It was established in 2004 by Georgina Chapman and Keren Craig. Marchesa is known for designing dresses for celebrities, including Scarlett Johansson, Jennifer Lopez, Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway, and Penélope Cruz.  Products  Vera Farmiga wearing Marchesa at the 82nd Academy Awards in 2010. Marchesa launched a handbag line, wedding dress line, Marchesa Bridal Couture, and collaborated with Lenox on dinnerware designs. In 2010, Marchesa collaborated with Le Métier de Beauté on a cosmetics line featuring the palettes of designers Chapman and Craig. History Marchesa is named after socialite Marchesa Luisa Casati. Founders Georgina Chapman and Keren Craig met at Chelsea College of Art and Design in London. Chapman, a graduate of the Wimbledon School of Art, began her career as a costume designer. Craig graduated from Brighton Art College focused on print and embroidery design. Chapman's draping and design paired with Craig's textile creations resulted in the establishment of Marchesa in 2004. Sienna Miller wore Marchesa on the cover of Vogue magazine's September 2007 issue (photographed by Mario Testino), which was the subject of the 2009 documentary, The September Issue. =Celebrities= The brand has been worn by Hollywood actresses on the red carpet. Sandra Bullock wore Marchesa at the 2010 Academy Awards, where she won Best Actress and was also named among the best dressed by readers of the Huffington Post. Sarah Hyland wore Marchesa at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. A number of celebrities wore Marchesa to the 2016 Met Gala, including Poppy Delevingne, Karolína Kurková, and Nina Dobrev. Weinstein controversy The success of the brand among celebrities was in part attributed to the influence of Miramax producer Harvey Weinstein, husband of Chapman. Weinstein reportedly pressured actresses who appeared in his films to wear the brand. After Weinstein's sexual abuse allegations emerged with allegations made by multiple actresses, Marchesa, once a mainstay of the red carpet, had been shunned by all the celebrities attending various awards ceremonies, in favor of other brands. In May 2018, Scarlett Johansson broke this months-long trend of red-carpet Marchesa avoidance by wearing a custom-made gown from the brand to the Met Gala. Since the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke, designers Georgina Chapman and Keren Craig have not spoken to the press about their business. The Fall 2019 collection was presented by couture design director Anna Holvik and Notte design director Ceazar Cabreros instead of Chapman and Craig. On 25 June 2019, Craig announced that she is going to leave Marchesa, which came after Harvey Weinstein's controversy.https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/25/harvey- weinstein-rape-conviction-movie-industry-hadley-freeman References External links * 2004 establishments in New York City Clothing brands of the United States Clothing companies based in New York City Clothing companies established in 2004 Fashion accessory brands High fashion brands Privately held companies based in New York (state) ","title":"Marchesa (brand)"},{"id":"15996570","text":"Gypsophilia is a Canadian jazz band from Nova Scotia. The band is composed of Ross Burns, Alec Frith, Nick Wilkinson (guitars), Gina Burgess (violin), Adam Fine (double bass), Matt Myer (trumpet), and Sageev Oore (piano, keyboards, accordion, melodica). Gypsophilia has released four albums to date, Minor Hope,(June 2007) Sa-ba-da-OW! (2009), Constellation (2011) and Nightswimming (2015) plus a b-sides compilation Horska (2013). On June 9, 2017 the band announced that they would be retiring after 13 years following their summer tour across Canada and a few final farewell performances in Halifax.http://www.gypsophilia.org/frontpage/one-last-time/ Musical style Gypsophilia was initially inspired by the music of French jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt, but soon found its own distinctive sound through unique original compositions and the melding of the band members' varied backgrounds and influences. While \\"gypsy jazz\\" remains a major component of the music, Gypsophilia has incorporated elements of tango, klezmer, funk, classical music, hard bop and post bop, and its soloists avoid the heavily-clichéd improvisational style found in most contemporary \\"gypsy jazz\\". The band's repertoire ranges from energetic swinging dance music to more sophisticated jazz, from highly improvised to through-composed pieces, but often combines these elements, striving to incorporate challenging modern harmonies and melodies in the context of an accessible, swinging beat. Debut album Gypsophilia's first CD Minor Hope was released on May 19, 2007. Recorded live over two nights at The Sonic Temple recording studio in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the album's thirteen original compositions demonstrate the range of influences that inform Gypsophilia's sound. For example, the long-form HIV Jump (D. Oore) mixes classical music with classic jazz and fusion. Nicole's Song (N. Wilkinson) builds from a contemplative ballad through a somewhat baroque bridge to a dynamic suspended climax. Sebo Psoriatic Psongs (D. Oore) begins as a dissonant country blues and ends with ‘70s Roland Kirk-inspired blues- funk. Kfeetz kfotz (קפיץ קפוץ) (D. Oore) is an uptempo klezmer romp. Vulnerable (D. Oore) is a fragile and highly-textured triple-metre ballad. Minor Hope (D. Oore) builds on the Django Reinhardt standard \\"Minor Swing\\" with new melody and harmony, and a solo double bass cadenza. Critical and audience response Gypsophilia's music has been enthusiastically received, and most of the band's performances have sold out quickly. In addition to finding a fanbase among jazz listening audiences, Gypsophilia has become popular among the indie scene in Canada, perhaps due to the music's high energy and wild stage antics at their live shows. Minor Hope has also been critically well-received, earning nominations for Nova Scotia Music Awards (Group Recording of the Year, Jazz Recording of the Year) and an East Coast Music Award (Jazz Recording of the Year).

United States – Singapore relations are bilateral relations between the United States and Singapore. Singapore and the United States share a very close and excellent relationship. According to the U.S. Global Leadership Report, 77% of Singaporeans approved of U.S. leadership under the Obama Administration in 2010, and while this approval rating decreased slightly down to 75% in 2011, it nonetheless remains one of the highest ratings of the U.S. for any surveyed country in the Asia-Pacific region.U.S. Global Leadership Project Report - 2011 Gallup  History  The United States first opened a consulate in Singapore in 1836, when the island was part of the Straits Settlements of the British Empire. Singapore and the United States have maintained formal diplomatic relations since the independence of Singapore in 1965. Singapore's efforts to maintain economic growth and political stability and its support for regional cooperation harmonize with U.S. policy in the region and form a solid basis for amicable relations between the two countries. =Hendrickson affair= E. Mason \\"Hank\\" Hendrickson (born 1945), an American diplomat married to fellow Foreign Service officer Anne E. Derse, was serving as the First Secretary of the United States Embassy when he was expelled by the Singaporean government in May 1988. Prior to his expulsion, he arranged for Francis Seow and Patrick Seong to travel to Washington, D.C. to meet with American officials at Hendrickson's arrangement. After their return, Singapore detained them under the Internal Security Act. Based on Seow and Seong's statements while in custody, the Singaporean government alleged that Hendrickson attempted to interfere in Singapore's internal affairs by cultivating opposition figures in a \\"Marxist conspiracy\\". Then-First Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong claimed that Hendrickson's alleged conspiracy could have resulted in the election of 20 or 30 opposition politicians to Parliament, which in his words could lead to \\"horrendous\\" effects, possibly even the paralysis and fall of the Singaporean government. In the aftermath of Hendrickson's expulsion, the U.S. State Department praised his performance in Singapore and denied any impropriety in his actions. The State Department also expelled Robert Chua, a senior-level Singaporean diplomat equal in rank to Mason, from Washington, D.C. in response. The State Department's refusal to reprimand Hendrickson, along with their expulsion of the Singaporean diplomat, sparked a protest in Singapore by the National Trades Union Congress; they drove buses around the U.S. embassy, held a rally attended by four thousand workers, and issued a statement deriding the U.S. as \\"sneaky, arrogant, and untrustworthy\\". A Heritage Foundation paper speculated that Singapore's angry public reaction to the Hendrickson affair may have been a response to the January 1988 termination of Singapore's eligibility for the Generalized System of Preferences, which provided tariff exemptions on Singaporean exports to the United States. =2018 North Korea-US Summit= The latest meeting was held on 11 June 2018 between Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and President Donald Trump at the Istana before meeting Kim Jong Un the next day.

Under the U.S.–Singapore Strategic Framework Agreement, some U.S. Navy littoral combat ships are rotationally deployed to Singapore's Changi Naval Base. Air Force One also lands at Paya Lebar Air Base whenever the president visits the country. On September 23, 2019, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and US President Donald Trump renewed a key defence pact which allows American forces to use Singapore’s air and naval bases, extending it by another 15 years to 2035. Relief operations Following that devastation of the United States Gulf Coast by Hurricane Katrina, three Singaporean CH-47 Chinook helicopters and thirty-eight RSAF personnel from a training detachment based in Grand Prairie, Texas, assisted in relief operations from 1 September. They ferried about 700 evacuees and hauled tons of supplies in 39 sorties on 4 September. One more CH-47 Chinook helicopter was sent to aid in relief efforts. =Academic exchanges= In 2011, more than 4,300 Singaporeans were studying in the United States, the highest figure in 10 years. The number of Singaporean students studying in the United States grew by 7 percent since 2010. American universities with the most number of Singaporeans are among the most prestigious in the country which includes Harvard University, Cornell University, Stanford University, and University of California, Berkeley. To add to the rising number of college students study in the United States, many local students in Singapore have also opted to study in American High Schools. US Ambassador to Singapore David I. Adelman said that the high number of Singaporeans studying in the United States reflects that Singapore–United States relations \\"have never been better\\". In 2012, Singapore and the United States signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to enhance collaboration in education between the two countries. This is the second MOU between the United States and Singapore on education. The first MOU signed in 2002 primarily focused on the teaching and learning of the Singaporean method of Mathematics and Science. The 2012 MOU have enhanced the teaching of Mathematics and Science, teacher development and school leadership, and educational research and benchmarking studies. In Addition, the conference also announced that the National Institute of Education (NIE) in Singapore and Columbia University's Teachers College are launching a joint Masters of Arts in Leadership and Educational Change. This joint Masters programme will take in up to 30 students from January 2013.

Interior of the dome in 2004. The Reichstag dome is a glass dome, constructed on top of the rebuilt Reichstag building in Berlin. It was designed by architect Norman Foster and built to symbolize the reunification of Germany. The distinctive appearance of the dome has made it a prominent landmark in Berlin. Design The Reichstag dome is a large glass dome with a 360 degree view of the surrounding Berlin cityscape. The debating chamber of the Bundestag, the German parliament, can be seen below. A mirrored cone in the center of the dome directs sunlight into the building, and so that visitors can see the working of the chamber. The dome is open to the public and can be reached by climbing two steel, spiralling ramps that are reminiscent of a double helix. The Dome symbolizes that the people are above the government, as was not the case during Nazism. The glass dome was also designed by Foster to be environmentally friendly. Energy efficient features involving the use of the daylight shining through the mirrored cone were applied, effectively decreasing the carbon emissions of the building. A large sun shield tracks the movement of the sun electronically and blocks direct sunlight which, would not only cause large solar gain, but also dazzle those below. The futuristic and transparent design of the Reichstag dome is intended to symbolize Berlin's attempt to move away from a past of Nazism and instead towards a future with a heavier emphasis on a united, democratic Germany. Construction Spiral walkway inside the glass dome With the reunification of Germany and the decision to move the capital from Bonn back to Berlin, it was also decided that the original Reichstag building should be rebuilt along with a new dome that emphasized a unified Germany. Architect Norman Foster won a commission to design and rebuild the Reichstag in 1993. Foster originally wanted a parasol-esque building, but his original design was rejected, partly due to the unrealistic costs. The design of the dome was at first controversial, but has become accepted as one of Berlin's most important landmarks. It derives from a design by Gottfried Böhm, who had previously suggested a cupola of glass with visitors walking on spiral ways to the top in 1988. His design was added to the information of the competition in 1992, which was won by Foster. Later the Bundestag decided that a cupola had to be built and Foster consequently gave up his resistance against it. Foster reused the idea of a spiral walkway within a conical structure for his design for City Hall in London some years later. The dome was constructed by Waagner-Biro. Original dome The Reichstag before the war with original dome in 1895. The original Reichstag building was proposed due to a need for a larger parliamentary building. Construction did not immediately begin due to debates between Otto von Bismarck and Reichstag members. In 1894, after an architectural contest, the winner, Frankfurt architect Paul Wallot, was chosen to design the building, which featured a very large dome. On February 27, 1933, the plenary chamber of the Reichstag building was destroyed in the Reichstag fire, an act blamed on the Communists, despite there being little evidence to determine who actually started the fire. The remains of the building and the dome were further demolished with the bombings of Berlin through World War II and the eventual fall of Berlin to the Soviets in 1945. While the Reichstag building was partially reconstructed in the 1960s as a conference center, the dome was not. Much of the dome and the ornaments that decorated it had been removed by that time.

Dufaux 4, 1909 Emile Taddéoli and his Dufaux 4, 1910 Armand Dufaux in the Dufaux 4 seaplane on Lake Geneva, December 1910 The Dufaux 4 was an experimental aircraft built in Switzerland in 1909 and which was originally constructed as an unnamed biplane, the third aircraft constructed by the brothers Armand and Henri Dufaux. The aircraft was entirely conventional for the era - a two-bay biplane with unstaggered wings of equal span and a triangular-section fuselage. Construction began in mid-September 1909 and work proceeded rapidly, as the brothers hoped to claim a CHF 1,000 prize put up by the Automobile Club de Suisse for the first Swiss-built aircraft to fly a 1 km closed-circuit. In early December, flight tests commenced at a field in Corsier. Although the machine made a few hops, it would not fly. The Dufaux brothers concluded that the field chosen was too small to give the aircraft enough room to build up speed for takeoff, so they selected a new location for their tests in Viry, in neighbouring France. The aircraft was assembled there on December 16 and a number of successful flights were made that same afternoon. The following day, the aircraft refused to takeoff on a number of attempts, but finally became airborne late in the afternoon. During this flight, at an altitude of 15 metres (50 ft), Henri attempted to bank the aircraft, but instead, it sideslipped to the ground. Both wings and the propeller were destroyed in the crash, but Henri was completely uninjured and the engine was undamaged. The brothers quickly rebuilt the machine in time to display it at an aviation meet at Colombier, but due to the inclement weather, did not attempt to fly it. By this time the brothers had started building the design, now dubbed the Dufaux 4, in series and were accepting orders for aircraft. In May, the aircraft was demonstrated for the Swiss military, but the brothers were informed that the aircraft was not suitable for military purposes. The Dufaux 4 is perhaps best remembered for a successful aerial crossing of Lake Geneva, performed by Armande on 28 August. He flew from St. Gingolph to Geneva at an altitude of around 150 m (500 ft), taking 56 minutes and 5 seconds for the crossing, and collecting a prize of CHF 5,000 that had been put up by the Perrot-Duval Company for this feat. An example is preserved at the Swiss Transport Museum.

It has elements of fantasy. It was started by director Amrit Sagar, based on Hatim al-Tai.  Plot  The story is set in the Middle East around the Middle Ages. The story starts with the birth of the emperor of Yemen's son who is named Hatim, of whom is said that he will spread the message of peace and good. At the same time the son of the emperor of Jaffar is born, but due to black magic done by palace resident Najumi, it is said that the baby will be the greatest ever known servant of the evil spirits. The emperor of Jaffar then decides that it is better for the world that the baby is killed. The king orders that the baby's heart be burned; his man Najumi, who secretly serves the evil spirits, burns the heart of a rabbit instead and shows it to the emperor, leaving the emperor believing that the baby is dead. Najumi names the baby Dajjal and teaches him all about the dark arts. Twenty years pass, Hatim grows up into a kind-hearted, benevolent and beloved prince of Yemen, whereas in Jaffar, Dajjal deposes and kills his parents and becomes the emperor of Jaffar. He creates an eternal fire on the top tower of his palace that grants him dark powers. Najumi explains to him that to become the supreme lord of the world he would have to capture the forces of good which he can do by marrying Sunena, the princess of Durgapur, who is goodness personified. However, she has to decide to marry Dajjal on her own and shouldn't be married by force. Dajjal arrives at Durgapur to ask the hand of Sunena, but she refuses. In the middle of the conflict where Dajjal threatens, Sunena's teenage brother Suraj takes out his sword and slices of Dajjal's hand; but it heals. Dajjal turns him into a stone statue and tells Sunena that only he can return her brother normal, but he will do so only if she is ready to marry him. He gives her a time-limit of seven months after which the curse will become permanent. In Yemen, Hatim's marriage is fixed with Jasmin the princess of Paristan (Fairyland). Hatim and Jasmin fall for each other in their very first meeting. Their wedding arrangements are ready but abruptly, Sunena's lover, Prince Vishal of Janakpur, comes disguised as a beggar, pleading with Hatim to help him fight Dajjal. The emperor of Yemen, Hatim, the emperor of Paristan, and Vishal meet together. The emperor of Paristan reveals that when Paristan was created by the forces of good, a prophecy was made that an evil lord will control this world as long as the angel of good doesn't intervene. Hatim must solve seven questions, to eliminate the power being given by dark forces to Dajjal, and for this purpose he must set off on a journey to distant lands and fantasy. The emperor gives Hatim a magical sword Name - Jwestrongil. Jasmin lends Hatim her childhood friend and server, Hobo, a fat elf as his bodyguard. Slowly all of Dajjal's powers and magical towers get destroyed as Hatim solves the questions. After solving the sixth question, there isn't enough time left to solve the seventh question and the armies of Yemen, Paristan, Durgapur and Janakpur descend on Jaffar for the final battle. As they fight a futile battle against Dajjal's zombie armie, Hatim invades the castle and fights Dajjal to death. They both die simultaneously but Hatim defeats death finding the answer to the seventh question.

Bush and Slovak President Ivan Gasparovic meet at the White House in October 2008. The fall of the socialist regime in Czechoslovakia in 1989 and the subsequent split of the two republics on January 1, 1993, allowed for renewed cooperation between the United States and Slovakia. The election of a pro-Western, reformist government in late 1998 further boosted close ties between the countries. The United States delivered more than $200 million after 1990 to support the rebuilding of a healthy democracy and market economy in Slovakia, primarily through programs administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Slovakia and the United States retain strong diplomatic ties and cooperate in the military and law enforcement areas. The U.S. Department of Defense programs have contributed significantly to Slovak military reforms. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have their roots in Slovakia, and many retain strong cultural and familial ties to the Slovak Republic. President Woodrow Wilson and the United States played a major role in the establishment of the original Czechoslovak state on October 28, 1918, and President Wilson's Fourteen Points were the basis for the union of the Czechs and Slovaks. Tomas Masaryk, the father of the Czechoslovak state and its first president, visited the United States during World War I and used the U.S. Constitution as a model for the first Czechoslovak Constitution.

The U.S. has maintained an official presence in Slovenia since the early 1970s, when the United States Information Agency (USIS) opened a library and American press and cultural center in Ljubljana. From its opening through 1992, the American Center worked to develop closer grassroots relations between the United States and the people of the then-Socialist Republic of Slovenia, a constituent republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On December 23, 1990, the Slovene people voted in a plebiscite to separate from greater Yugoslavia. On June 25, 1991, the new Republic of Slovenia officially declared its independence from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. A 10-day war commenced, during which Slovenian territorial troops fought off incursions by the Yugoslav People's Army. The United States formally recognized the new republic on April 7, 1992. To develop U.S. diplomatic relations with the new state, the United States opened a new Embassy in Ljubljana in August 1992. From the departure of Yousif Ghafari in January 2009 till November 2010, the U.S. Ambassador position was vacant. From November 2010 to 2015 it was held by Joseph A. Mussomeli. According to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, 26% of Slovenes approve of U.S. leadership, with 52% disapproving and 22% uncertain.U.S. Global Leadership Project Report - 2012 Gallup In November 2016, the United States elected Donald Trump as President of the United States, making his Slovenia-born wife, Melania, the First Lady of the United States. Diplomacy and politics Embassy of Slovenia in Washington, D.C. Embassy of the United States in Ljubljana Slovenian and American heads of state have exchanged several visits since Slovenia's independence, including George W. Bush's visit in June 2008 for the European Union-U.S. summit during Slovenia's EU Presidency. A meeting on the highest level between Slovenia and the United States happened in Prague in April 2010, when the President of the United States Barack Obama and the Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor attended a formal dinner of the leaders of the Central and Eastern Europe. Pahor called attention to the security situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Afghanistan and thanked the United States for its continuing support in strengthening trust among the Western Balkans leaders. On 28 November 2010, the New York Times media company published information acquired by WikiLeaks that in 2009, the United States officials offered Slovenia a meeting with Barack Obama under the condition that the country accepts one of the Guantanamo Bay detainees. Overall, according to Der Spiegel, 836 classified and secret diplomatic cables of the United States Department of State (State Department) mentioning Slovenia have been released through WikiLeaks in the November 2010 United States diplomatic cables leak. Most of them date from 2004 till 2010. According to the data published by Tableau Software, there were 947 cables related to Slovenia. On 29 November 2010, the Slovenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied any conditioning of the State Department with the acceptance of the Guantanamo detainees and said the cable mentioning the bargain is unknown to them. Slovenian media reported the Government of Slovenia had been discussing the acceptance of one Guantanamo detainee and that it had been in the process of preparing the legislation needed to allow it to accept detainees from Guantanamo. The ambassador Mussomeli stated there was no bargaining among the states. On 7 February 2011, the Slovenian Prime Minister Pahor started his visit in the United States. In the three-day visit he met several Democrats, among them Tom Harkin and Joseph Biden and met for a short time with the President Barack Obama in the White House. He also met with several businessmen and held a lecure on the Johns Hopkins University about the relations between the United States and the European Union. The conversations with American politicians regarded the economic development in the United States and in Slovenia. The bilateral relations were assessed as very constructive. Pahor was accompanied by the Slovenian foreign minister Samuel Žbogar who on 11 February attended the discussion in the United Nations Security Council about safeguarding international peace and security and met with the Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon. Economy The United States is Slovenia's largest non-European trading partner. The U.S. imported $699.7 million of goods from Slovenia, and exported $305.5 million in 2014. Under the Support for Eastern European Democracy (SEED) Act, the U.S. provided technical assistance on enterprise competitiveness, banking and pension reform, competition policy, and debt restructuring. Reflecting the progress Slovenia has made in these areas, Slovenia was among the first transition countries to \\"graduate\\" from the SEED program. Slovenia is a member of the European Union and trade relations are subject to Slovenian, EU, and U.S. law. Military Slovenia contributed assistance to the United States and NATO by facilitating the deployment of the Implementation Force and subsequently contributed helicopters, medical personnel, military police, and an infantry company to the Stabilisation Force (SFOR) and continues to be active in the European Union Force. The United States supported Slovenia's accession to NATO in March 2004 and continues to work with the Slovenian military to promote greater cooperation and interoperability with NATO forces. The U.S. European Command provides a liaison team that works with the Ministry of Defense full-time to develop greater familiarity with NATO structures and procedures. As of June 2008, Slovenia had 34 troops deployed in Bosnia and Herzegovina (ALTHEA, EUFOR, Joint Enterprise, NATO), 363 troops in the NATO Kosovo Force (KFOR), 65 Slovenian personnel with the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission in Afghanistan, 2 instructors to the NATO Training Mission in Iraq, 14 troops in Lebanon (UNIFIL), 3 in Syria (UNTSO), 15 at the EU Mission in Chad, and 1 in the U.S. (CENTCOM, NATO). With strong U.S. support, Slovenia has developed the International Trust Fund as the demining instrument of choice in the Balkans and is expanding operations to include the Caucasus. Slovenia also participates in several of the U.S. Office of Defense Cooperation's programs. The State Partnership Program allows access to experts within the state of Colorado on the full range of military-to- military, military-to-civilian and civilian-to-civilian activities between Slovenia and the U.S. The International Military Education and Training program provides military education and training in a professional and non- political manner, exposing foreign students to US professional military organizations. Training through the IMET program has been available to Slovenian Ministry of Defense employees and members of Slovenian Armed forces since 1993. To date, several hundred students have been trained in the US and in various seminars organized in Slovenia. Slovenia has also been an active participant in the U.S. Service Academies, a four-year military officer program, with 5 Military, 2 Air Force and 1 Naval Academy graduates in the Slovene Armed Forces. Travel and education In October 1997, Slovenia joined the group of countries whose citizens enjoy the privilege of visa-free travel to the United States and American travelers receive mutual benefits in Slovenia. Approximately 17,000 Slovenes travel to the U.S. each year and an estimated 20,000 Americans visit Slovenia. The Fulbright Program, funded by the U.S. government, sends 6-8 scholars and students to Slovenia from the U.S. every year, and hosts 6-8 scholars and students from Slovenia in the U.S. Culture Benjamin Franklin's book Poor Richard's Almanack was the first translation of an English text into Slovene. It was translated in 1812 by Janez Nepomuk Primic (1785–1823). In the first half of the 19th century, the Slovenes came into their first true encounter with America and the United States by the writings of the missionary Frederick Baraga (1797–1868), active among the Ojibwe Indians in Michigan. In 1853, just one year after its original publication, two independent translations of the novel Uncle Tom's Cabin were independently published by the writer Franc Malavašič in Ljubljana and the priest Janez Božič in Graz. These started the since-then uninterrupted dialogue between American authors and Slovene translators and readers.

History  The United States and Solomon Islands established diplomatic relations following its independence on July 7, 1978. U.S. representation is handled by the United States Embassy at Port Moresby where the Ambassador is resident. In recognition of the close ties forged between the United States and the people of the Solomon Islands during World War II, the U.S. Congress financed the construction of the Solomon Islands Parliament building. There are approximately 95 American citizens residing permanently in Solomon Islands. Assistance The two nations belong to a variety of regional organizations, including the Pacific Community and the Pacific Regional Environmental Program. The United States and Solomon Islands also cooperate under the U.S.-Pacific Islands multilateral Tuna Fisheries Treaty, under which the U.S. grants $18 million per year to Pacific island parties and the latter provide access to U.S. fishing vessels. The U.S. Coast Guard provides training to Solomon Islands border protection officers, and the U.S. military also provides appropriate military education and training courses to national security officials. The U.S. Peace Corps suspended its program in June 2000 due to the ethnic violence and breakdown in governance. More than 70 volunteers, serving throughout the country in rural community development, education, environmental management, and youth programs, were evacuated. U.S. trade with Solomon Islands is very limited. In 2001, U.S. exports to Solomon Islands were less than 5% of all exports, while Solomon Islands exports to the United States in that year were negligible.

Somalia has an embassy in Washington, D.C., and the United States maintains an embassy in Mogadishu which was reopened in late 2019. History Somalia had historic relations with the United States under the Geledi Sultanate. In 1776, the Geledi Sultanate was the first independent state in Africa to recognise the United States, and diplomatic relations were established in 1777 with the Geledi sharing naval intelligence with the American naval forces. In 1897, the Geledi Sultanate sent a high-profile delegation to New York under their foreign minister Khalid Aden Mohammed and signed the Indian Ocean Naval Treaty to combat Zanzibar slave trading. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Somalia's then socialist government abandoned alliances with its former partner the Soviet Union due to fallout over the Ogaden War. Because the Soviet Union had close relations with both the Somali government and Ethiopia's then new communist Dergue regime, they were forced to choose one side to commit to. The Soviet shift in support to Ethiopia motivated the Siad Barre government to seek allies elsewhere. It eventually settled on the Soviet Unions' Cold War rival, the United States. The US had been courting the Somali government for some time on account of Somalia's strategic position at the mouth of the Bab el Mandeb gateway to the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. Somalia's initial friendship with the Soviet Union and later military support by the United States enabled it to build the largest army on the continent.Oliver Ramsbotham, Tom Woodhouse, Encyclopedia of international peacekeeping operations, (ABC-CLIO: 1999), p.222.Somalia as a Military Target Former Somalia embassy in Washington, D.C.. After the collapse of the Barre government and the start of the Somali Civil War in the early 1990s, the United States embassy in Mogadishu was evacuated and closed down. However, the American government never formally severed diplomatic ties with Somalia, leading the UN-sanctioned multinational Unified Task Force (UNITAF) in southern Somalia. Following the establishment of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) in 2004, the U.S. also acknowledged and supported the internationally recognized TFG as the country's national governing body. It likewise engaged Somalia's regional administrations, such as Puntland and Somaliland, to ensure broad-based inclusion in the peace process. President of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at the State Department (January 2013). The Federal Government of Somalia was established on August 20, 2012, concurrent with the end of the TFG's interim mandate. It represents the first permanent central government in the country since the start of the civil war. On September 10, 2012, the new Federal Parliament also elected Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as the incumbent President of Somalia. The election was welcomed by the U.S. authorities, who re-affirmed United States' continued support for Somalia's government, its territorial integrity and sovereignty. In January 2013, the U.S. announced that it was set to exchange diplomatic notes with the new central government of Somalia, re- establishing official ties with the country for the first time in 20 years. According to the Department of State, the decision was made in recognition of the significant progress that the Somali authorities had achieved on both the political and war fronts. The move is expected to grant the Somali government access to new sources of development funds from American agencies as well as international bodies like the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, thereby facilitating the ongoing reconstruction process. President of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry at the State Department (September 2013). At the behest of the Somali and American federal governments, among other international actors, the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved United Nations Security Council Resolution 2093 during its 6 March 2013 meeting to suspend the 21-year arms embargo on Somalia. The endorsement officially lifts the purchase ban on light weapons for a provisional period of one year, but retains certain restrictions on the procurement of heavy arms such as surface-to-air missiles, howitzers and cannons. On April 9, 2013, the U.S. government likewise approved the provision of defense articles and services by the American authorities to the Somali Federal Government. At the request of the Somali authorities and AMISOM, the U.S. military in late 2013 also established a small team of advisers in Mogadishu to provide consultative and planning support to the allied forces. On 5 May 2015, President of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke, and other senior Somali government officials met with US Secretary of State John Kerry in Mogadishu. The bilateral meeting was the first ever visit to Somalia by an incumbent US Secretary of State. It served as a symbol of the ameliorated political and security situation in the country. The officials focused on the benchmarks enshrined within Somalia's Vision 2016 political roadmap, as well as cooperation in the security sector. In January 2017 after President Donald Trump took office, Somali citizens were temporary banned from entering the United States by the executive order \\"Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States.\\" This also includes Somali refugees who are willing to resettle in the United States through the US refugee admissions program. After the election of Somali-American dual citizen Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed as the next Somali President, US Secretary Of State Rex Tillerson congratulated the president- elect and is looking forward to strengthen the relationship between Somalia and the United States and that the recent elections marks an important milestone in Somalia's ongoing transition to peace, stability, and prosperity. Trade and partnerships The United States has continued to be one of the main suppliers of armaments to the Somali National Army (SNA). In June 2009, the reconstituted SNA received 40 tonnes worth of arms and ammunition from the U.S. government to assist it in combating the Islamist insurgency within southern Somalia. The U.S. administration also pledged more military equipment and material resources to help the Somali authorities firm up on general security. Additionally, the two countries engage in minor trade and investment. The United States exports legumes, grain baking-related commodities, donated products and machinery to Somalia. Somalia in turn exports precious stones and low-value shipments to the United States. Diplomatic missions Somalia maintains an embassy in Washington, D.C.. Between July and December 2014, the diplomatic mission was led by Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke, who served as Somalia's first Ambassador to the United States since 1991. As of April 2015, Fatuma Abdullahi Insaniya is the Ambassador of Somalia to the United States. The Somaliland region also has a Liaison Office in Washington, D.C. The US opened a Consulate-General in Mogadishu in 1957, the capital of the Trust Territory of Somaliland, a UN trusteeship under Italian administration. The consulate was upgraded to embassy status in July 1960, when the US recognized Somalia's independence and appointed an ambassador. It later closed down in January 1991, following the start of the civil war. The US also operated a consulate in Hargeisa in northwestern Somalia in the 1960s. In June 2014, in what she described as a gesture of the deepening relations between Washington and Mogadishu and faith in Somalia's stabilization efforts, U.S. Undersecretary of State Wendy Sherman announced that the United States would reopen its diplomatic mission in Mogadishu at an unspecified future date. In February 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama nominated Foreign Service veteran Katherine Simonds Dhanani to become the new Ambassador of the United States to Somalia. Dhanani later withdrew her nomination in May of the year, citing personal reasons. In May 2015, in recognition of the sociopolitical progress made in Somalia and its return to effective governance, US Secretary of State John Kerry announced a preliminary plan to reestablish the US embassy in Mogadishu. He indicated that although there was no set timetable for the premises' relaunch, the US government had immediately begun upgrading its diplomatic representation in the country. President of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud and Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke also presented to Kerry the real estate deed for land reserved for the new US embassy compound. In November 2015, Somalia re- opened its embassy in Washington, DC. In December 2018, the United States reopened a \\"permanent diplomatic presence\\" in Mogadishu. The new mission will not be a full embassy and some diplomatic staff are expected to remain at the US Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya where the US Mission to Somalia is based. The current US Ambassador to Somalia is Donald Yamamoto.

It was a member party of the Alliance Party from 1963 to 1966 and a member of Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition from 1976 until its expulsion in 2004. It contested the General Election in 2004 as well as the Sarawak state elections of 2006 and 2011 as an opposition party. On 18 April 2010, SNAP officially became a member of the Pakatan Rakyat (PR), the federal opposition coalition. However, just before the Sarawak State Elections in April 2011, SNAP withdrew from PR, citing seat allocation disagreements with People's Justice Party (PKR). On 17 January 2013, the Federal Court of Malaysia declared that SNAP is no longer a registered party because the party did not furnish evidence that leadership tussle in the party has been resolved. History =Early years= The SNAP was formed on 10 April 1961, the third party to be formed after the Sarawak United Peoples' Party (SUPP) and Parti Negara Sarawak (PANAS), open the way for Dayaks' active participation not only in the effort to prepare Sarawak's Independence, but also to be fully involved in political activities. Although there were Dayak in SUPP and PANAS, which were and are objectives respectively, the Dayaks' interest in the two parties were secondary and their roles minimal. Thus the Dayaks, particularly the Ibans felt that they might be left behind in the decision making of Sarawak that was desirous of becoming an independent country, if they did not have their own. So SNAP was born in Betong, Second Division, and its formation was greatly welcomed by the vast majority of the Ibans, who formed one-third of Sarawak's population then. Among the founders were Stephen Kalong Ningkan, who become its secretary-general, J.S. Tinker (Chairman), Edward Howell, Edwin Howell, Ivory Kedit, Mathew Dana Ujai, David Lawrence Usit, Nyipa Julin and Lionel Bediman Anak Ketit. The first general assembly of the party was held on 29 April 1961 at Munggu Bangkit, Betong, where the party was born. It became the party headquarters. About 300 people throughout Sarawak attend the assembly. Soon after the assembly, Ningkan and Tinker went to the First, Fourth and Fifth Divisions canvassing for membership and at the same time forming branches and sub-branches. It took them three months before returning to Betong. Edward Jeli who joined the party later canvassed for membership in Miri while others concentrated in the Second Division. After serious thoughts, SNAP accepted non-Dayaks as party members in 1963 with James Wong Kim Min as the first Chinese to join as a member. Others who later joined the party included Wee Hood Teck, Wee Boon Ping and Ho Ah Chon. Abang Othman Bin Datuk Abang Haji Moasili was the first Malay to join the party. Wee Hood Teck and Wee Boon Ping became the main financers of the party. Their presence and that of other non-Dayaks made SNAP a multi-racial party, although the bulk of its members were Dayaks. In August 1962, another party came into being in Sibu to cater for the Ibans of Batang Rajang. Its promoters refused to join SNAP, which they said, only catered for Ibans from Saribas. The party was known as Parti Pesaka Anak Sarawak (PESAKA) and among the initiators were Penghulu Masam Anak Radin, Pengarah Banyang, Penghulu Chundi Anak Resa and Penghulu Umpau. Temenggong Jugah, Temenggong Oyong Lawai Jau and Jonathan Bangau joined later. While Jugah and Oyong Lawai Jau were incipiently members of PANAS, Bangau was from SUPP. Others Penghulus from other divisions such as Penghulu Tawi Sli (Second Division) and Penghulu Abok Anak Jalin (Bintulu) also joined PESAKA. PESAKA was, therefore, known as the Penghulus' Party (Malay: Parti Penghulu). However, the person who actually mooted the idea of forming PESAKA was Thomas Kana, a former dresser at Kuala Belait. He was made the first secretary-general of the party. Incidentally, Ningkan, a SNAP founding member, was also a dresser at Kuala Belait. During their days in Kuala Belait, Ningkan and Kana greatly disliked one another and often threw insults at one another. When they returned to Sarawak, Ningkan formed SNAP and Kana formed PESAKA and both started to sow the seeds of disunity among the Ibans of Sarawak principally between the Ibans of Batang Rajang and the Iban of Saribas. They refused to compromise as both wanted to become \\"big\\" in a party and in the government. As far-fetched as it may be, Dayak unity, as we know it today took roots in the major differences and personal animosity of these two men. =1983 crisis= The crisis began in June 1980 when Dunstan Endawie Enchana who was the deputy chief minister of Sarawak and the president of SNAP, resigned from the party presidency. He was later appointed to Malaysian High Commissioner to New Zealand. Dunstan wanted Daniel Tajem to succeed him as the deputy chief minister while James Wong to become the president of the party. Joseph Samuel was also nominated for the party president post by party members. In a 25-member meeting, the delegates overwhelmingly supported Joseph Samuel for Sarawak deputy chief minister. However, Abdul Rahman Ya'kub, who was the chief minister of Sarawak, went against their wishes and appointed Daniel Tajem as the new deputy chief minister of Sarawak. Abdul Rahman's action has caused anger among the SNAP members because their wish was not respected.Hazis, FS (2012). In Domination and Contestation: Muslim Bumiputera Politics in Sarawak. Institute of Southeast Asian Studies. p. 120-124, 127, 128. . Google Book Search. Retrieved 1 February 2015. Leo Moggie was appointed as the party acting president after that. In March 1981, Abdul Rahman stepped down from the chief minister post and succeeded by his nephew Abdul Taib Mahmud. During SNAP party election in December 1981, James Wong challenged Leo Moggie for the president post. Moggie faction felt that SNAP, being a Dayak-based party, should be led by a Dayak instead of a Chinese. However, Wong's faction felt that James Wong has contributed so much to the party so he should be given an opportunity to lead the party. James Wong successfully defeated Moggie in the party president's race by a narrow majority of 15 votes. A supporter of Leo Moggie, Daniel Tajem also lost the vice-president post to Wong's supporter, Edward Jeli. James Wong tried to calm down the party by offering vice-president posts to Leo Moggie and Daniel Tajem. However, such offering did not satisfy Moggie's faction. The Malaysian parliament was dissolved on 29 March 1982 to make way for 1982 general election. James Wong tried to exclude Leo Moggie's supporters (Edmund Langgu, Edwin Tangkun, and Jonathan Narwin) in contesting for the parliamentary election. Chief minister Abdul Taib Mahmud decided to honour the list of candidates submitted by James Wong. However, Sarawak ruling coalition Barisan Nasional (BN) led by Taib, lost 5 parliamentary seats to the opposition. SNAP was a component party of BN at that time. Three seats were lost to Patrick Uren, Edmund Langgu, and Edwin Tanggun where all of them were former SNAP members contesting against the SNAP party. In 1983, Daniel Tajem, who was still the deputy chief minister of Sarawak, was expelled from the SNAP party because he was found guilty of helping the former SNAP candidates to contest against the official candidates listed by SNAP party in 1982 parliamentary election. However, Daniel Tajem refused to step down from the deputy chief minister post. Subsequently, in July 1983, Daniel Tajem and Leo Moggie formed a new party named Parti Bansa Dayak Sarawak (PBDS) in order to challenge James Wong's leadership in SNAP. Leo Moggie became the president of PBDS while Daniel Tajem became the deputy president of the party. PBDS immediately applied to join Taib's Barisan Nasional (BN) despite strong opposition by SNAP. PBDS was subsequently admitted into BN by Abdul Taib Mahmud despite strong opposition by Balang Seling, the secretary-general of SNAP. The decision to admit PBDS into BN was also welcomed by Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister of Malaysia at that time. The admission of PBDS into the BN has weakened the position of SNAP in the coalition because some of the electoral seats by SNAP would have to be given to PBDS. The formation of PBDS party further fragmented the voice of Dayak community in the Sarawak state government. The Dayak community was already divided between Muslim- bumiputera based Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB), Dayak-based Sarawak National Party (SNAP), and Chinese-based Sarawak United Peoples' Party (SUPP) before this. In 1983 elections, SNAP wanted to retain all the 18 seats it held previously in 1979 Sarawak state elections and was unwilling to give in to PBDS's demands for seats. Abdul Taib Mahmud, the chief minister of Sarawak at that time, then decided to allow SNAP to contest against PBDS in 1983 Sarawak state election under their respective party symbols instead of a common symbol of BN coalition. In this election, SNAP fielded candidates in 18 seats while PBDS fielded candidates in 14 seats. However, SNAP only managed to win 8 seats and PBDS won 6 seats after the election.

She rose to prominence after being kidnapped by the FARC-EP along with two of her sons and other members of her building. During captivity she was elected Member of the Colombian Chamber of Representatives and placed in a list of high-profile kidnapped victims held by the FARC in hopes to have a prisoner exchange. She was finally released on February 27, 2008 along with three other high-profile hostages. Captivity and election Shortly after Polanco and her sons were kidnapped in 2001, her husband Jaime Lozada Perdomo tried in vain to negotiate with the FARC, but after six months of futile attempts he chose to inscribe his wife as a candidate for the seat he was trying to run in Congress under the affiliation of the Movimiento de Integración Conservadora, a conservative political party he had founded. By doing this, he hoped to raise her profile as a political hostage and give his family a better chance to be freed in a political prisoner exchange. His plan worked, Gloria Polanco was elected with 28,742 votes becoming the only kidnapped politician to win an election of the sort. Her victory was credited to her work with the needy as First Lady of Huila. Although Polanco was Representative Elect to the Chamber for the constituency of Huila, she was not able to take office because of her captivity and was substituted by Carlos Ramiro Chavarro in her absence. Regardless of her appointment, she was treated as a political hostage, and her kidnap became a high priority for the Colombian Government. The FARC also changed her condition to that of a high-profile hostage, which to her dismay, lead to being separated from her sons who were also hostages. She was moved to another camp where other political hostages were being held. Her two sons were finally freed after her husband Jaime Lozada agreed to pay off their ransom. Lozada was later killed during an attack by the FARC in 2005, which also left Polanco's oldest son injured. It is believed that Lozada was killed because he still owed the FARC ransom money.

The United States and South Africa have been economically linked to one another since the late 18th century which has continued into the 21st century. U.S. and South Africa relations faced periods of strain throughout the 20th century due to the segregationist, white rule in South Africa, from 1948–1994. Following apartheid in South Africa, the U.S. and South Africa have developed a strategically, politically, and economically beneficial relationship with one another and currently enjoy \\"cordial relations\\" despite \\"occasional strains\\". South Africa remains the United State's largest trading partner in Africa as of 2019. History The United States has maintained an official presence in South Africa since 1799, when an American consulate was opened in Cape Town. The U.S. Embassy is located in Pretoria, and Consulates General are in Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town. In 1929, the United States and South Africa established official diplomatic relations. However, following WWII, both the United States and South Africa had political affairs that impacted their relations with all of the world. The United States had entered into the Cold War with the Soviet Union; while, simultaneously, the Nationalist Party in South Africa won the 1948 election against its rival, the United Party. With the Nationalist Party in power, this meant that the segregationist policies that had been impacting South Africa had become lawful, and the Apartheid Era had begun. Due to this, the United States policies towards South Africa were altered; and, overall, the relationship between South Africa and the United States was strained until the end of apartheid rule. Following the Apartheid Era, the United States and South Africa have maintained bilateral relations. =Apartheid Era= The Apartheid Era began under the rule of the Nationalist Party which was elected into power 1948. Throughout the Apartheid Era, United States foreign policy was heavily influenced by the Cold War. During the early period of apartheid in South Africa, the United States maintained friendly relations with South Africa, which may be attributed to the anti-communist ideals held by the National Party. However, over the course of the 20th century, American-South African relations were impacted by the apartheid system in place under the Nationalist Party. At times, the United States cooperated with and maintained bilateral relations with South Africa; and, at other times, the United States took political action against it. Cooperation 2 Squadron Mustang fighters during the Korean War in the early 1950s. Throughout the Apartheid Era, economic ties between the United States and South Africa played a prominent role in their relations with one another. From the 1950s to the 1980s, United States exports to, imports from, and direct investment in South Africa as a whole increased. South Africa was seen as an important trade partner because it provided the United States with access to various mineral resources— like chromium, manganese, vanadium— vital for the U.S. steel industry.Thomson, p 8. Aside from trade and investment, South Africa also provided a strategic location for a naval base and access to much of the African continent. In addition, the United States had a NASA missile tracking station located in South Africa, which became controversial in American politics due to segregation being practiced on the stations in compliance with apartheid policy. In the early 1950s the South African Air Force supported the United States during the Korean War by fighting on the side of the United Nations. Resistance Following the Sharpeville Massacre in 1960, the United States relations with South Africa began to undergo changes. In 1963, under the Kennedy Administration, the United States voluntarily placed an arms embargo on South Africa in cooperation with the United Nations Security Council Resolution 181. After President Kennedy's assassination and under the Johnson Administration, the United States policy towards South Africa was greatly impacted by the Civil Rights Movement taking place at home. In regards to the African struggles in Africa, President Johnson shared that: : The foreign policy of the United States is rooted in its life at home. We will not permit human rights to be restricted in our own country. And we will not support policies abroad which are based on the rule of minorities or the discredited notion that men are unequal before the law. We will not live by a double standard—professing abroad what we do not practice at home, or venerating at home what we ignore abroad. The primary political action taken by the Johnson Administration was the implementation of National Security Action Memorandum 295 in 1963. This, in short, aimed to promote change in apartheid policy in South Africa whilst still maintaining economic relations. Similarly, in 1968, the Johnson Administration created a National Policy Paper which discussed the U.S. political objectives of balancing a bilateral economic relationship with South Africa, while also promoting the end of apartheid in South Africa. Under the Nixon Administration and the Ford Administration, although controversial, most scholars agree that these administrations failed to combat apartheid policy in South Africa. The Carter Administration is known for its confrontational strategy against apartheid and white rule in South Africa. However, although the Carter Administration advocated for human rights in South Africa, most scholars agree that it was unsuccessful in creating change in South Africa. The Carter Administration feared that divestment of American companies in South Africa could have worsened the conditions for the black majority, while strengthening the position of the white minority in South Africa. This resulted in the Carter Administration refraining from placing sanctions—often promoted by the anti-apartheid movement—on South Africa, and lead to growth in investments in South Africa. Throughout the Johnson, Nixon, Ford, and Carter administrations, the United States anti-apartheid movement as well as divestment from South Africa campaigns increasingly gained support from the American public. The growth of the anti-apartheid movement as well as the divestment campaign lead to increased pressure on the U.S. government to take action against apartheid policy in South Africa. It is during this time— when these movements had more support than ever before— that the Reagan Administration came into office. Reagan meeting with the anti-apartheid activist Bishop Desmond Tutu in the oval office in 1984. The Reagan administration followed a policy of constructive engagement with the apartheid government in South Africa. The United States Congress forced a change in policy by imposing sanctions on the apartheid government in 1986. The Reagan administration practiced a policy of \\"constructive engagement\\" to gently push South Africa toward a moral racially sensitive regime. The policy had been developed by State Department official Chester Crocker as part of a larger policy of cooperation with South Africa to address regional turmoil.J. E. Davies, Constructive Engagement? Chester Crocker and American Policy in South Africa, Namibia and Angola 1981–1988 (2008). However, anger was growing in the United States, with leaders in both parties calling for sanctions to punish South Africa. Lawrence Eagleburger, Reagan's Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, in June 1983 announced a clear shift in policy to an insistence upon fundamental change in Pretoria's racial policy, as the Reagan administration had to confront growing congressional and public support for sanctions.Michael Clough, \\"Beyond constructive engagement.\\" Foreign Policy;; 61 (1985): 3–24. Online The new policy was inadequate to such anti-apartheid leaders as Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Weeks after it was announced that he had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize he went to the United States and denounced the Reagan administration's policy as inherently immoral. On 4 December 1984, he told the U.S. House Subcommittee on Africa: : Apartheid is an evil as immoral and unchristian in my view as Nazism, and in my view the Reagan administration's support in collaboration with it is equally immoral, evil, and totally unchristian, without remainder. However, on 7 December, Tutu met face-to-face with Reagan at the White House. They agreed that apartheid was repugnant and should be dismantled by peaceful means.Allen, p 249. Because efforts at constructive engagement had not succeeded in altering South Africa's policy of apartheid, Washington D.C. had to adapt this policy. In 1986, despite President Reagan's effort to veto it, the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 (CAAA) was enacted by United States Congress. This act was the first in this era that not only implemented economic sanctions, but also offered to aid to the victims living under apartheid rule. The Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act was the starting point for unified policy towards South Africa in United States politics. Under the Reagan, Clinton, and Bush administrations, there were continued efforts to try to end apartheid. By 1994, apartheid in South Africa had officially ended. Nelson Mandela was elected as the first president of this newly democratic nation. =Post Apartheid= PEPFAR program has helped to stabilize the AIDS pandemic in South Africa. Since the abolition of apartheid and the first-ever democratic elections of April 1994, the United States has enjoyed a bilateral relationship with South Africa. Although there are differences of position between the two governments (regarding Iraq, for example), they have not impeded cooperation on a broad range of key issues. Bilateral cooperation in counter-terrorism, fighting HIV/AIDS, and military relations has been particularly positive. Through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the United States also provides assistance to South Africa to help them meet their developmental goals. Peace Corps volunteers began working in South Africa in 1997. During the presidency of Thabo Mbeki (1999–2008) relations were strained due to a combination of the ANC's paranoia around alleged CIA activities in the country and perceived criticism of Mbeki's AIDS denialism, a feeling partly based on the ANC's experiences of tacit American support for the Apartheid government during the Reagan administration. The Bush administration's wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as its PEPFAR initiative (that clashed with Mbeki's views on AIDS) served to alienate the South African presidency until president Mbeki left government in 2008. Until 2008, the United States had officially considered Nelson Mandela a terrorist, however on 5 July 2008 Mandela along with as other ANC members including the then current foreign minister were removed from a US terrorist watchlist. Harry Schwarz, who served as South African Ambassador to the United States during its transition to representative democracy (1991–1994), has been credited as having played one of the leading roles in the renewal of relations between the two nations. Peter Fabricius described Schwarz as having \\"engineered a state of US/South Africa relations better than it has ever been”. The fact that Schwarz, for decades a well known anti- apartheid figurehead, was willing to accept the position was widely acknowledged as a highly symbolic demonstration of President F. W de Klerk's determination to introduce a new democratic system. During Schwarz's tenure, he negotiated the lifting of US sanctions against South Africa, secured a $600 million aid package from President Bill Clinton, signed the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty in 1991 and hosted President Mandela's state visit to the US in October 1994. funeral of Nelson Mandela. |alt= On 28 January 2009, newly elected US President Barack Obama telephoned his newly installed counterpart Kgalema Motlanthe as one of a list of foreign contacts he had been working through since his presidential inauguration the previous week. Given primary treatment was South Africa's role in helping to resolve the political crisis in Zimbabwe. According to White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the pair \\"shared concerns\\" on the matter. Obama credited South Africa for holding \\"a key role\\" in resolving the Zimbabwean crisis, and said that he was looking forward to working with President Motlanthe to address global financial issues at the 2009 G-20 London summit.Quoted in AFP 2009. The election of Obama along with Mbeki's departure from office as well as the enactment of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) with South Africa as a key beneficiary greatly improved opinions within the South African government of its relationship with the United States. As of 2014 the relationship between South Africa and the United States in the Zuma/Obama years is thought not to be as close as it was during the Mandela/Clinton years but greatly improved since the Mbeki/Bush years. The Zuma years coincided with a continuation of cooling of South Africa–United States relations whilst China–South Africa relations warmed significantly as South Africa focused diplomatic efforts on supporting the BRICS initiative. During the Trump administration relations between the two countries cooled due to statements made by President Trump regarding land reform in South Africa and the listing of South Africa as one of ten countries the \\"worst record\\" of supporting US positions in the United Nations. The publication of the list was accompanied with the statement that the Trump administration was considering cutting off American aid to listed countries. Diplomatic visits Diplomatic visits between the two nations increased near the end of apartheid. In February 1990, U.S. President George H.W. Bush invited both sitting South African President F.W. de Klerk and ANC leader Nelson Mandela to visit the White House. Both men accepted the invitation, with de Klerk scheduled to visit 18 June 1990 and Mandela, recently released from prison, scheduled to visit a week later. After controversy arose in South Africa, de Klerk postponed his visit. Mandela visited Washington on 24 June 1990 and met with President Bush and other officials. He also addressed a joint session of Congress. In September, de Klerk visited Washington, the first official state visit by a South African leader. Mandela was subsequently elected President of South Africa, and U.S. Vice President Al Gore and First Lady Hillary Clinton attended his inauguration in Pretoria in May 1994. In October of that year, Mandela returned to Washington for a state dinner hosted by U.S. President Bill Clinton. President Clinton visited South Africa in March 1998, marking the first time a sitting U.S. president visited the country. Since Clinton's visit, two of his successors have visited the country: President George W. Bush visited in July 2003, and President Barack Obama visited in June 2013.  Economic links  As of 2020 South Africa is the largest trade partner and investment source for the United States in Africa with over 600 American firms operating in the country. US$7.3 billion in direct investment from the United States to South Africa was recorded in 2017 while South African direct investment in the United States totaled US$4.1 billion for the same year. Thus making South Africa a net beneficiary of American investment. Bilaterial trade between the two countries totaled US$18.9 billion with South Africa having a surplus of US$2.1 billion for 2018. This partly attributed to the AGOA which gives South Africa key trading rights and reduced tariffs thereby allowing the country to diversify its exports when trading with the United States. The United States has used threats to remove South Africa from AGOA to lobby South Africa to allow for increase imports of American chicken and for the country not to pass certain legislation involving American companies. Such as the Private Security Industry Regulation Amendment Bill which would have seen all foreign security companies in South Africa sell off 51% ownership to South African entities.

United States and Sri Lanka started to enhance defence relations beyond the sale of military equipment, and training facilities were extended when Sri Lanka was in an internal battle with a secessionist movement Tamil Tigers. During Ranil Wickremesinghe's time as Prime Minister in 2002, agreements were signed with the US which allowed Sri Lanka to get assistance in terms of military training, military technology, intelligence, special training in counter- terrorism, and direct monetary assistance for military development. During the ceasefire period, United States Pacific Command assessment team conducted a study from 12 September 2002 to 24 October 2002, which made several recommendations to strengthen the capabilities of the Sri Lanka Army, Sri Lanka Navy and Sri Lanka Air Force in case of the peace process failing. After studying the weakness of the military, the study recommended the use of cluster bombs (which weren't banned until 2010 when Cluster Munitions Convention came into effect) to destroy unarmoured area targets and arming Kfir's and Mi-24 gunships with guided weapons in case of fighting close to enemy forces. The US also donated the SLNS Samudura during this time. It was reported that the US Navy Pacific Command provided intelligence to the Sri Lankan government during the civil war to hunt down LTTE crews and four ships. This was later confirmed by the former president Mahinda Rajapaksa whose government was hostile to the United States.

Trapessac was constructed in the 12th century by the Knights Templar and, together with the nearby fortress at Bagras, guarded the Syrian Gates, the principal pass between the coastal region of Cilicia and inland Syria.Robert W. Edwards, The Fortifications of Armenian Cilicia (Washington, D.C.: Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, 1987), p. 253. The castle fell to Saladin in 1188 after a bitterly fought, two-week siege. Lying as it did at a key point in the Amanus marches between the Principality of Antioch and the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, both the Templars and the Armenians were eager to retake the castle. Leo I of Armenia attempted to seize it in 1205 but was repelled by the defenders. The Templars also launched an expedition to recover it in 1237, but were ambushed and badly defeated, suffering grievous losses. It was reoccupied by Hetoum I in 1261 after the Mongols captured it in their invasion of Syria. However, the Armenians were not to hold it long. After the defeat of the Armenian army at the Battle of Mari in 1266, Hetoum agreed to surrender the fortress to the Mamluks to ransom his son Leo. It passed into the hands of Baibars in 1268. In 1280, the fortress was temporarily regained by Abaqa Khan when he advanced to sack Aleppo, only to be abandoned when he withdrew from Syria.

It was developed from the land-based CM.170 Magister. It was replaced in 1994. Design and development The French Navy's Aéronavale adopted a derivative of the Fouga CM.170-1 Magister as a basic trainer for carrier operations. Originally designated CM-170M Esquif, the prototype first flew on 31 July 1956, and was redesignated as the CM.175 Zéphyr soon after. Carrier trials were conducted from and off the French coast. The Zéphyr differed from the Magister in being equipped with an arrester hook and a modified structure and undercarriage strengthened for carrier operations. The Zéphyr also included a nose-mounted light. As it did not have ejection seats, the Zéphyr had new sliding canopy hoods which could be locked open during carrier launchings and landings. One six-round rocket pod could be mounted under each wing for weapons training. Two guns could be fitted in the nose, but these were seldom carried. Thirty-two aircraft were delivered. Operational history The first production aircraft first flew on 30 May 1959 and entered service in October 1959 with 59S the deck landing school at Hyéres.

The United States government has been critical of Sudan's human rights record and has dispatched a strong UN Peacekeeping force to Darfur.Peter Woodward, U.S. foreign policy and the Horn of Africa (Routledge, 2016). A review of relations The United States established diplomatic relations with Sudan in 1956, following its independence from joint administration by Egypt and the United Kingdom. After the outbreak of the Six- Day War in June 1967, Sudan declared war on Israel and broke diplomatic relations with the U.S. Relations improved after July 1971, when the Sudanese Communist Party attempted to overthrow President Nimeiry, and Nimeiry suspected Soviet involvement. Relations improved further after the U.S. provided assistance for the resettlement of refugees following the 1972 peace settlement that brought the First Sudanese Civil War with the south. Sudan and the United States reestablished diplomatic relations in 1972. On 1 March 1973, Palestinian terrorists of the Black September organization murdered U.S. Ambassador Cleo A. Noel and Deputy Chief of Mission Curtis G. Moore in Khartoum. Sudanese officials arrested the terrorists and tried them on murder charges. In June 1974, however, they were released to the custody of the Egyptian government. The U.S. Ambassador to Sudan was withdrawn in protest. Although the U.S. Ambassador returned to Khartoum in November, relations with Sudan remained static until early 1976, when President Nimeiri mediated the release of 10 American hostages being held by Eritrean insurgents in rebel strongholds in northern Ethiopia. In 1976, the U.S. resumed economic assistance to Sudan. Jaafar Nimeiry arriving on a state visit to the United States, 1983 The United States went from an unusually important and close relationship with Sudan in the early 1980s to one that began to deteriorate near the end of the Nimeiry government. In late 1985, there was a reduction in staff at the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum because of the presence of a large contingent of Libyan terrorists. In April 1986, relations with Sudan deteriorated when the U.S. bombed Tripoli, Libya. A U.S. Embassy employee was shot on 16 April 1986. Immediately following this incident, all non-essential personnel and all dependents left for six months. At this time, Sudan was the single largest recipient of U.S. development and military assistance in sub- Saharan Africa. =Presidency of Omar al-Bashir= Relations between the countries declined quickly following the 1989 military coup and the rise of Islamist leaders in Sudan's government. Sudanese support for Iraq during the 1990–91 Gulf War helped ensure the downturn. The United States, pushed by domestic interest groups such as evangelical Christians and the Congressional Black Caucus, expressed outspoken unhappiness over Khartoum's handling of the war with the SPLM/A, the human-rights situation, including alleged government support for slavery, and its welcoming environment toward international terrorist groups. Washington put Sudan on its list of state supporters of terrorism in 1993, an action that resulted in additional U.S. sanctions against Sudan. The administration of President William J. Clinton subsequently worked to isolate Sudan. During the mid-1990s, it instituted a Front Line States policy of pressure against Khartoum with the assistance of Uganda, Ethiopia, and Eritrea. Growing unhappiness over Sudan's policies and terrorist threat information aimed at Americans in Sudan, much of which turned out to be false, caused the United States in the spring of 1996 to relocate all Americans from the embassy in Khartoum to the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi. The embassy in Khartoum remained open but staffed by Sudanese and occasional Americans visiting from Kenya. At the urging of the United States, Sudan forced Osama bin Laden to leave the country in May of 1996, but Washington did not follow this development by trying to improve ties with Sudan. The low point in relations occurred in August 1998, just days after the bombing of the American embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya, when a U.S. naval vessel launched cruise missiles against a pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum on the questionable grounds that it was linked to the production of chemical weapons. At the end of the Clinton administration, the United States opened a dialogue with Sudan on counterterrorism, and Sudan was receptive. The George W. Bush administration generally continued a tough policy toward Sudan, but the events of September 11, 2001, had a dramatic impact on the relationship. The United States moved counterterrorism to the highest foreign- policy priority, and Sudan, taking advantage of this new situation, stepped up its counterterrorism cooperation with the United States. President Bush nominated former Senator John Danforth as his special envoy for Sudan in 2001. Danforth focused on ending the Sudanese civil war, but the U.S. Congress and the evangelical community remained highly critical of Sudan. The United States pursued a policy of carrots and sticks. In October 2002, President Bush signed the congressionally initiated Sudan Peace Act, which provided for punitive financial and diplomatic steps against Sudan if Washington concluded that Khartoum was acting in bad faith at the peace talks. At the same time, Sudan offered significant cooperation on counterterrorism, a response appreciated in Washington. The United States, working with IGAD, Britain, and Norway, played a key role in bringing the civil war in Sudan to an end. While this development had the potential to significantly improve Sudanese–American relations, Sudan's botched handling of the crisis in Darfur that began in 2003 set back relations with Washington. In 2006, under pressure from Congress and domestic interest groups, the Bush administration named another special envoy for Sudan, Andrew Natsios, who resigned at the end of 2007 and was replaced by former diplomat Richard S. Williamson. The United States took the lead in requesting the UN Security Council to impose additional international sanctions against Sudan. Failing to convince the UN to institute broader sanctions, President Bush signed a bill at the end of 2007 that allowed state and local governments to cut investment ties with companies doing business with Sudan. At the same time, the United States committed US$2.7 billion in fiscal years 2005–6 for humanitarian assistance, peacekeeping in Darfur, implementation of the CPA, and reconstruction and development in South Sudan. Khartoum continued to cooperate with the United States on counterterrorism. The United States also was the single largest holder—in the amount of US$1.5 billion—of Sudanese debt. The United States supported full implementation of the CPA and the Darfur Peace Agreement and rapid deployment of more than 20,000 additional peacekeepers to Darfur. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry with Sudanese Foreign Minister Ibrahim Ghandour, 2015 The situation in Darfur dominated the United States–Sudan relationship until early in the administration of President Barack H. Obama. Obama named Scott Gration as the new special envoy for Sudan. He changed the tone of the dialogue with the government in Khartoum and began contact with Darfur's highly fragmented rebel movements. He also concluded that the United States must give at least as much attention to successful implementation of the CPA as to resolution of the crisis in Darfur. He favored engagement with Khartoum over confrontation and proposed a policy of engagement that included rewards and penalties. Gration’s policy had support in the White House but detractors elsewhere in the U.S. government and some harsh critics on Capitol Hill and in the “Save Darfur Coalition” community. Late in 2010, the United States spelled out the conditions for the normalization of ties with Sudan. They included full implementation of the CPA and the holding of a referendum on the future of South Sudan in January 2011. The United States significantly increased the number of personnel devoted to an effort to assure this outcome. Washington also noted that there must be peace and accountability in Darfur. On 13 January 2017, the U.S. lifted economic and trade sanctions on Sudan due to cooperation with the Sudanese government in fighting terrorism, reducing conflict, and denying safe haven to South Sudanese rebels and improving humanitarian access to people in need. The White House announced the easing of sanctions as part of a five-track engagement process. On 16 March 2017, the U.S. and Sudan announced the resumption of military relations after exchanging military attachés. In April 2017, it was announced that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which was “especially keen to see sanctions lifted“, had decided to open a large office in Khartoum. Sudan was also removed from the list of Muslim-majority countries on the American travel ban. On 6 October 2017, the U.S. permanently lifted all 1997 sanctions after Sudan cut all ties with the North Korean regime of Kim Jong Un. =Post-al-Bashir= Al-Bashir was deposed as Sudan's president in a coup d'état in April 2019. In September 2019, Sudan's new prime minister, Abdalla Hamdok, said that he held useful talks with U.S. officials while at the United Nations, and expressed hope Khartoum could “very soon\\" be removed from the U.S. state sponsor of terrorism list. In December 2019, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated that the U.S. and Sudan are to begin exchanging ambassadors after 23 years of no diplomatic relations. That same month, Hamdok became the first Sudanese leader to visit Washington D.C. since 1985. The last U.S. Ambassador was Tim Carney, who left the post on 30 November 1997. Also in December, it was reported that the Sudanese transitional government will close the offices of Hamas, Hezbollah, and any other Islamic group designated as terrorist by the U.S. Sudan remains on the U.S. state sponsor of terrorism list. Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo meets with Sudanese Sovereign Council Chair General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, in Khartoum, on . As of June 2019, the office of U.S. Ambassador to Sudan was vacant. The Chargé d’Affaires was Steven Koutsis and the Deputy Chief of Mission was Ellen B. Thorburn. On 5 May 2020, Sudan appointed Noureldin Sati, a veteran diplomat, as ambassador. In August 2020, Mike Pompeo became the first US secretary of state to visit Sudan since Condoleezza Rice in 2005. The visit came on the heels of the Israel–United Arab Emirates peace agreement. His visit was meant to discuss the possibility of opening relations between Sudan and Israel and exhibit assistance and support for Sudan's shift to democracy. In October 2020, President Donald Trump announced that he would lift the designation of Sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism once $335 million in compensation from Sudan to American families victims of terrorism were deposited. U.S. assistance Despite policy disagreements, the U.S. has been a major donor of humanitarian aid to Sudan throughout the last quarter century. The U.S. provided assistance for resettlement of refugees following the 1972 peace settlement that brought the First Sudanese Civil War with the south to an end. The U.S. was also a significant source of aid in the March 1989 \\"Operation Lifeline Sudan,\\" which delivered 100,000 metric tons of food into both government and SPLA-held areas of Sudan, averting widespread starvation. In 1991, the U.S. made large donations to alleviate food shortages caused by a two-year drought. In October 1997, the U.S. imposed comprehensive economic, trade, and financial sanctions against Sudan. However, during another drought in 2000-01, the U.S. and the broader international community responded to avert mass starvation in Sudan. In 2001, the Bush Administration named a Presidential Envoy for Peace in Sudan to explore what role the U.S. could play in ending Sudan's civil war and enhancing the delivery of humanitarian aid. For fiscal years 2005-2006, the U.S. committed almost $2.6 billion to Sudan for humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping in Darfur as well as support for the implementation of the peace accord and reconstruction and development in southern Sudan. In response to Sudan's continued complicity in unabated violence in Darfur, U.S. President George W. Bush imposed new economic sanctions on Sudan in May 2007. However, relations between both countries have, at least, the chance to improve since President Barack Obama's sending of Special Envoy Scott Gration to Sudan to improve diplomatic conditions, and discuss ways to avert the current Darfur conflict. On 9 September 2009, the U.S. published a new law to ease the sanctions on parts of Sudan. Obama named Donald E. Booth as his Special Envoy for Sudan and South Sudan on 28 August 2013.

According to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, 51% of Surinamese people approve of U.S. leadership, with 4% disapproving and 45% uncertain, the fifth-highest rating for any surveyed country in the Americas.U.S. Global Leadership Project Report - 2012 Gallup  History  Since the reestablishment of a democratic, elected government in 1991, the United States has maintained positive and mutually beneficial relations with Suriname based on the principles of democracy, respect for human rights, rule of law, and civilian authority over the military. To further strengthen civil society and bolster democratic institutions, the U.S. has provided training regarding appropriate roles for the military in civil society to some of Suriname's military officers and decision makers. In addition, narcotics trafficking organizations are channeling increasing quantities of cocaine through Suriname for repackaging and transport to Europe and the United States, and of ecstasy for transport to the United States. To assist Suriname in the fight against drugs and associated criminal activity, the U.S. has helped train Surinamese anti-drug squad personnel. The U.S. and Suriname also have significant partnerships in fighting trafficking in persons and money laundering. Since 2000, the U.S. has donated a criminal records database to the police as well as computers, vehicles, and radio equipment. Projects through which the U.S. has supported the judicial system include case management and computer hardware donation. Along with training projects, these programs have led to a strong relationship with law enforcement entities in Suriname. The U.S. Peace Corps in Suriname works with the Ministry of Regional Development and rural communities to encourage community development in Suriname's interior. Suriname is densely forested, and increased interest in large-scale commercial logging and mining in Suriname's interior have raised environmental concerns. The U.S. Forest Service, the Smithsonian, and numerous non-governmental environmental organizations have promoted technical cooperation with Suriname's government to prevent destruction of the country's tropical rain forest, one of the most diverse ecosystems in the world. U.S. experts have worked closely with local natural resource officials to encourage sustainable development of the interior and alternatives such as ecotourism. On December 1, 2000, UNESCO designated the 16,000 square kilometre Central Suriname Nature Reserve as a World Heritage Site. Suriname's tourism sector remains a minor part of the economy, and tourist infrastructure is limited (in 2004, some 145,000 foreign tourists visited Suriname). Suriname's efforts in recent years to liberalize economic policy created new possibilities for U.S. exports and investments. The U.S. remains one of Suriname's principal trading partners, largely due to ALCOA's longstanding investment in Suriname's bauxite mining and processing industry. Several U.S. corporations represented by Surinamese firms acting as dealers are active in Suriname, largely in the mining, consumer goods, and service sectors. Principal U.S. exports to Suriname include chemicals, vehicles, machine parts, meat, and wheat. U.S. consumer products are increasingly available through Suriname's many trading companies. Opportunities for U.S. exporters, service companies, and engineering firms will probably expand over the next decade. Suriname is looking to U.S. and other foreign investors to assist in the commercial development of its vast natural resources and to help finance infrastructure improvements. Enactment of a new investment code and intellectual property rights protection legislation which would strengthen Suriname's attractiveness to investors has been discussed; the investment law was approved by the National Assembly and is currently being revised by the Ministry of Finance.

The Mr. Science Show first aired on Time Warner Cable as a Public-access television show 1992 with Tim Perkins as Mister Science. In the 60 minute shows Perkins played a science enthusiast who offered several experiments mixed with stories which taught something about a particular area of science. The experiments often involved the children from the audience and were often simple enough to be tried by viewers. The presentations were delivered in a humorous way and there was always something that would go wrong, thus providing viewers with an example of what not to do. Distribution The Mr. Science Science Shows were taped live and distributed freely as educational fillers to other Time Warner Cable facilities where they were seen sporadically by audiences in the United States. Over 50 programs were scripted but only a few were actually produced and broadcast. The live tapings were sometimes attended by hundreds of children from Brevard County Public Schools.

History  =Consular relations= Commemorative plaque of the first American diplomatic representation in Switzerland, in Basel With the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars, many Swiss sought a more peaceful and prosperous life in America. A sizable number emigrated to the United States, especially from the cantons of Vaud and Lucerne. As early as 1815, representatives from the two respective cantons had proposed to the Federal Diet that the country establish a consulate in either Philadelphia or New York City to ensure the rights of their merchants and expatriates. The following year the Diet resolved to create a consulate in New York. It was initially decided that their consul would be chosen from the Swiss population in America, but no appointment was ever made. In July 1822, with consultation from Swiss–American diplomat Albert Gallatin, the Diet appointed its first two consuls to the United States: Henry Casimir de Rham of Yverdon-les-Bains, canton of Vaud, a banker and merchant and then-resident of New York; and Antoine Charles Cazenove of Geneva, a wine and tobacco merchant and then-resident of Alexandria, Virginia. Niklaus Rudolf von Wattenwyl, the chairman of the Diet, sent a letter to United States President James Monroe, asking him to grant the appointees an exequatur and emphasizing the liberal and federal characteristics shared by both of their countries' constitutions. The letter marked the first official correspondence between the governments of Switzerland and the United States and established a precedent for the character of relations between them throughout the rest of the 1800s. The United States granted the exequatur. Gallatin advised the Diet on how to divide the territory to be administered by the two new consuls. De Rham assumed responsibility for a district encompassing the New England states, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and the states north of the Ohio River. Cazenove managed the remainder of the United States. Their main charge was to protect the interests and property of Swiss immigrants and traveler, particularly merchants. Both performed their duties in an honorary capacity outside of their regular business, with de Rham serving until 1842 and Cazenove until 1852. The latter's responsibilities in his later service became increasingly diplomatic. Switzerland's cotton and silk exports to the United States increased significantly throughout the 1820s, making it more desirable for the latter to establish its own consulate. In 1830, John G. Boker, businessman from New York City and a friend of Chief Clerk of the Department of State Daniel Brent, was appointed to be the first American consul to Switzerland. He arrived that fall in Bern and was warmly received by the chairman of the Diet. While waiting for his commission to be approved by the 22 cantons, Boker moved to Basel, as most Swiss exports to America passed through there. Impatient with the tedious nature of the decentralized government, he opened his consulate in October without official Swiss recognition. The United States consuls in Switzerland were busy in their early years. Since their income was dependent on duties made on inspected and approved goods, many American consuls were forced to operate their own businesses for extra money, which diverted their attention from their official responsibilities. While they were on business trips, the consulate was left in the care of a vice-consul or agent, usually a hired merchant. In the absence of a consul, one agent briefly relocated the consulate to Zürich in 1843, though it was returned to Basel the following year upon the arrival of the new appointee, Seth T. Otis. =Diplomatic relations= Diplomatic relations were established in 1853 by the U.S. and in 1868 by Switzerland. The first diplomatic representation of the U.S. was established in Basel in 1853. The U.S. Embassy in Switzerland is in Bern. The U.S. Mission to the European Office of the United Nations and other International Organizations, the U.S. Mission to the WTO, and the U.S. Delegation to the Conference on Disarmament are in Geneva. America Centers and Consular Agencies are also maintained in Zurich and Geneva. The U.S. ambassador to Switzerland is also accredited to Liechtenstein. As of November 2017, the U.S. ambassador to Switzerland is Ed McMullen, and as of November, 2014 the Swiss ambassador to the U.S. is Martin Dahinden. Moreover, Switzerland acts as the protecting power for relations and interests between the U.S. and Iran as the United States severed relations with Iran in 1980, during the Iranian Revolution and the Hostage Crisis. Between 1963 and 2015, Switzerland acted as the protecting power between Cuba and the United States, until the embassies were re-established in Havana and Washington, D.C.. Switzerland has an embassy in Washington, D.C. and maintains consulates-general in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco.

The United States and Switzerland signed three new agreements in 2006 that will complement the JEC. The first of the new agreements is the Enhanced Political Framework and was signed by Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns and Swiss State Secretary Michael Ambühl. The second agreement is the Trade and Investment Cooperation Forum and was signed by then-U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman and then-Economics and Trade Minister Joseph Deiss. The last agreement is the revised Operative Working Arrangement on Law Enforcement Cooperation on Counterterrorism and was signed by U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and then-Swiss Justice Minister Christoph Blocher. In February 2013, the Swiss Federal Council allowed for the signing of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) with the US. These agreements force all Swiss banks to inform the Internal Revenue Service of undeclared, off-shore accounts.

Later, U.S.–Syrian relations were severed again in 1967 after the Six-Day War (Israeli–Arab War) which resulted in Israel's occupation of the Golan Heights. Following the achievement of the Agreement on Disengagement between Israel and Syria, relations resumed in June 1974, and, afterwards, U.S. President Richard Nixon visited Damascus on an official trip.

The U.S. and Syria also consulted closely on the Taif Accord, ending the civil war in Lebanon. In 1991, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad made a historic decision to accept then-President Bush's invitation to attend a Middle East peace conference and to engage in subsequent bilateral negotiations with Israel. Syria improved its relations with the United States by securing the release of Western hostages held in Lebanon and lifting the travel restrictions on Syrian Jews. Throughout the Clinton Administration there were multiple attempts to engage al-Assad in Middle East peace negotiations.

Syria's opposition to the Iraq War deteriorated relations. Serious contention arose because the Syrian Government failed to prevent foreign fighters from using Syrian borders to enter Iraq and refused to deport the elements from the former Saddam Hussein government that support Iraqi insurgency. In turn, Syrian officials had concerns due to the high influx of Iraqi refugees into their country. In May 2003, the U.S. Secretary of State, Colin Powell, visited Damascus to demand Syrian closure of the offices of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Issues of U.S. concern include its ongoing interference in Lebanese affairs, its protection of the leadership of Palestinian rejectionist groups in Damascus, its human rights record, and its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. Relations diminished after the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. In February 2005, in the wake of the Hariri assassination, the U.S. recalled its Ambassador to Washington. In 2008, the CIA and the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) carried out a paramilitary raid targeting Al-Qaeda in Iraq in the town of Sukkariyeh in Abu Kamal. Subsequent reports revealed that nearly a dozen similar operations had taken place in Syria, Pakistan, and elsewhere since a 2004 classified executive order, the Al-Qaida Network Exord, permitted such missions, stipulating that those in sensitive countries such as Syria and Pakistan required presidential approval.Eric Schmitt and Mark Mazzetti, \\"Secret Order Lets U.S. Raid Al Qaeda\\"; New York Times, 9 November 2008.Ewen MacAskill, \\"US forces staged more than a dozen foreign raids against al-Qaida: Former CIA official lifts lid on secret anti-terror operations\\"; The Guardian, 10 November 2008. Accusations of terrorism Syria is considered to be a secular dictatorship with a poor human rights record. Syria has been on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism since the list's inception in 1979 and deems it to be a “safe-haven” for terrorists. Syria rejects its classification by the U.S. as a state sponsor of terrorism. However, in a 1986 interview on CNN, former US Secretary of State Alexander Haig, when asked which country he regarded as the world's worst state sponsor of terrorism, answered \\"unquestionably Syria.\\" Also in 1986, the U.S. withdrew its ambassador and imposed additional administrative sanctions on Syria in response to evidence of direct Syrian involvement in an attempt to blow up an Israeli airplane. A U.S. ambassador returned to Damascus in 1987, partially in response to positive Syrian actions against terrorism such as expelling the Abu Nidal Organization from Syria and helping free an American hostage earlier that year. Syria has publicly condemned international terrorist attacks, and has not been directly linked to terrorist activity since 1986, as it denies any involvement in Hariri killing. Syria actively bars any Syrian-based terrorist attacks and targeting of Westerners. Instead, Syria provides “passive support” to groups it deems as legitimate resistance movements. The United States characterizes this as providing safe-havens for terrorists groups, as the Syrian government allows groups such as Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command to operate within its borders .United States Department of State The U.S. believes that Syria provides tactical and political support to these groups and in April 2010 condemned Syria as it believes it provides SCUD missiles to Hezbollah forces in Lebanon. On September 4, 2013, the Syrian Parliament addressed a letter to the U.S. House of Representatives. This letter argued against a U.S. bombing campaign against Syria, appealing to the two governments' common fight against Islamic extremism and blaming recent chemical weapons attacks on insurgents.Letter from Syrian Arab Republic People's Assembly to United States House of Representatives , 4 September 2013.Sunny Peter, \\"Syrian Crisis: Syrian People’s Assembly Writes to Western Counterparts, Seek Civilised Dialogue, Not Language of Fire and Blood\\", International Business Times, 10 September 2013.Dylan Scott, \\"READ: Here's What The Syrian Government Is Telling Congress\\", 9 September 2013. =Iraqi foreign fighters= The U.S. has also blamed Syria for the movement of foreign Al Qaeda affiliates into Iraq. The movement of these foreign fighters peaked between 2005 and 2007; however, Syria attempted to decrease such movement through increased monitoring of borders, and improved screening practices of those crossing the border. Since 2009 the Syrian government has indicated willingness to increase border security cooperation between Iraqi and US forces. =2006 US embassy bombing attempt in Damascus= On September 12, 2006 the U.S. Embassy was attacked by four armed assailants with guns, grenades and a car bomb (which failed to detonate). Syrian Security Forces successfully countered the attack, killing three attackers and injuring one. Two other Syrians killed during the attack were a government security guard and a passerby. The Syrian Government publicly stated that terrorists had carried out the attack. The U.S. Government has not received an official Syrian Government assessment of the motives or organization behind the attack, but security was upgraded at U.S. facilities. The Syrian ambassador to the U.S., Imad Moustapha, blamed the attack on Jund al-Sham; meanwhile, President Bashar al-Assad, however, blamed U.S. foreign policy in the region as contributing to the incident. Economic sanctions The U.S. government has imposed a series of economic sanctions on Syria. The chief form of sanctioning results in Syria’s inclusion on the list of state sponsors of terrorism. These include legislatively mandated penalties, including export sanctions and ineligibility to receive most forms of U.S. aid or to purchase U.S. military equipment. =Executive orders= There have been a series of executive orders enacted by President George W. Bush which include Executive Orders 13315, 13224, 13382, 13338, 13399, 13441, and 13460. These sanctions are imposed on certain Syrian citizens or entities due to their participation in terrorism, acts of public corruption, or their destabilizing activities in Iraq and Lebanon. In May 2004, a new comprehensive set of economic sanctions were enacted under the Bush administration by Executive Order 13338. In May 2010 President Barack Obama renewed this set of sanctions against Syria. As of 2010, there have been 20 Syrian citizens who have been sanctioned. On August 18, 2011, Executive Order 13582 signed by President Obama froze all assets of the Government of Syria, prohibited U.S. persons from engaging in any transaction involving the Government of Syria, banned U.S. imports of Syrian- origin petroleum or petroleum products, prohibited U.S. persons from having any dealings in or related to Syria’s petroleum or petroleum products, and prohibited U.S. persons from operating or investing in Syria.Executive Order 13582, U.S. Treasury Department This is considered the start of the comprehensive U.S. embargo on Syria. =Commercial Bank of Syria= In 2006 the U.S. government enacted sanctions against the Commercial Bank of Syria which was a result money laundering concerns provided for under section 311 of the USA Patriot Act. These sanctions stop U.S. banks and subsidiaries from maintaining correspondence accounts with the Commercial Bank of Syria. =Syrian Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act= The Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act, imposed sanctions on Syria banned the majority of exports to Syria except food and medicine, specifically prohibiting the export of most goods containing more than 10% U.S.-manufactured component parts to Syria.. Since 2009 =Under President Barack Obama= The Obama administration initiated a policy of rapprochement with Syria. However, with the governments' violent response to the Syrian civil war in 2011, relations cooled dramatically and senior American officials, including President Obama himself, repeatedly called for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to resign. Lifting of travel restrictions In February 2010 the US travel advisory for American citizens traveling to Syria was lifted. The advisory had been in place since the 2006 embassy bombing attempt. The US Embassy in Syria reported that, \\"After carefully assessing the current situation in Syria, we determined that circumstances didn't merit extending the travel warning.” This move was seen by many as one of the first steps towards better bilateral relations. Re-engagement On February 17, 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama appointed American diplomat Robert Stephen Ford to serve as the new U.S. Ambassador to Syria, the first since 2005 in the aftermath of the Hariri assassination. Shortly after Ford's appointment, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs William Burns arrived in Damascus and hosted talks with President Bashar al-Assad in an attempt to revive relations. The talks were described as \\"candid\\" and that common ground was met on those issues pertaining to Iraq and Lebanon. In July 2010, Senator Arlen Specter met with al-Assad in attempts to further continue the new dialogue. In meetings revolved around discussing \\"specific steps to promote regional stability, revive Syria–Israel peace talks, and strengthen U.S.–Syrian bilateral relations.\\" Diplomatic cables between the US embassy in Damascus and the State Department that were released by WikiLeaks in 2011 revealed that the US gave financial support to political opposition groups and related projects at least through September 2010. The cables were sent because embassy staff became worried as Syrian intelligence agents were investigating these programs. The financing which began during the presidency of George W. Bush included $6 million to the Barada satellite television channel which broadcast anti-government programming into Syria. Barada TV is closely affiliated with the Movement for Justice and Development, a London-based network of Syrian exiles. Reaction to Syrian Civil War Military situation in the Syrian Civil War in December 2015 As the conflict in Syria had intensified, U.S. president Obama in mid-August 2011 stated publicly that Syria′s president Bashar al-Assad should step down. The U.S. pushed strongly for the United Nations Security Council to pass a resolution condemning the Syrian government′s measures to suppress the rebellion and adopting economic sanctions against Syria in late September and early October 2011, and when Russia and the People's Republic of China wielded their veto power to block the proposal, Ambassador Susan Rice expressed \\"outrage\\". Relations were further strained by Syrian security forces' failure to protect Robert Stephen Ford, the U.S. ambassador to Syria, from being attacked by pro-Assad crowds on at least two occasions, as well as to prevent vandalism of the U.S. embassy and diplomatic property. On 24 October 2011, the U.S. announced that it had recalled Ambassador Ford due to 'credible threats against his personal safety.\\" After the revelation of the Houla massacre in May 2012, the U.S. State Department announced that Syrian chargé d'affaires in Washington had been given 72 hours to leave the country. Effective February 6, 2012, the U.S. Embassy suspended operations and closed for normal consular services. Currently, US interests in Syria are represented by an Interests Section in the Embassy of the Czech Republic. In December 2012, US president Barack Obama announced the US would formally recognise the Syrian Opposition Coalition, rather than the Damascus government, as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people. , the embassy of the United States is suspended due to the Syrian Civil War. The Syrian National Coalition’s offices in the United States were recognised as diplomatic missions in May 2014.Syrian opposition offices get US diplomatic recognition, The National May 6, 2014U.S. recognizes Syria opposition offices as 'foreign mission', Reuters, MAY 5, 2014 =Arming Syrian rebels= Army of Glory fighter launches a BGM-71 TOW anti-tank missile at a Syrian government position during the 2017 Hama offensive. Between 2013 and 2017, under the aegis of the covert CIA-directed operation Timber Sycamore and the overt Department of Defence-led Syrian Train and Equip Program, the US trained and armed nearly 10,000 rebel fighters at a cost of $1 billion a year. The CIA had been sending weapons to anti-government rebels in Syria since at least 2012. Some of these weapons reportedly fell into hands of extremists, such as al-Nusra Front and ISIL. Former CIA analyst and Brookings Institution fellow Bruce Riedel has stated that Saudi support for the program has given Saudi Arabia greater say over American policy in the Syrian Civil War. It was reported in July 2017 that President Donald Trump had ordered a \\"phasing out\\" of the CIA's support for anti-government rebels. It was reportedly done in order to improve relations with Russia. It was said it would be done not without a return. In December 2017, Max Abrams and John Glaser observed in the Los Angeles Times that \\"[ISIL] imploded right after external support for the 'moderate' rebels dried up,\\" which is consistent with studies demonstrating that \\"external support for the opposition tends to exacerbate and extend civil wars, which usually peter out not through power- sharing agreements among fighting equals, but when one side—typically, the incumbent—achieves dominance.\\" =Under President Donald Trump= U.S. special operations forces near Manbij, acting as advisors to the Syrian Democratic Forces, March 2017 Trump's safe zone proposals During and after his campaign, Trump proposed establishing safe zones in Syria as an alternative to Syrian refugees' immigration to the US. In the past \\"safe zones\\" have been interpreted as establishing, among other things, no-fly zones over Syria. During the Obama administration Turkey encouraged the US to establish safe zones; the Obama administration was concerned about the potential for pulling the US into a war with Russia. Although safe zones were not in the final version of Trump's controversial Executive Order 13769, an earlier draft leaked several days before would have required the US to create a plan for safe zones in Syria. On January 30, the Saudi government informed Trump that it supported the creation of safe zones in Syria and Yemen. Two days later, on February 2, Trump discussed safe zones with the government of Jordan. On February 3 the U.S. secured Lebanon's backing for safe zones in Syria. On February 1 Russia asked the U.S. to be more specific on its safe-zone plan and expressed hope the U.S. would discuss it with Russia before implementation. On February 3 the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees opposed safe zones. On February 10, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while welcoming a notion that U.S. troops might fight alongside Syria, rejected the proposal for safe zones as \\"not a realistic idea at all\\". Turkey unveiled a new proposal for safe zones to Sunni Arab states meeting February 13 in Bahrain. On 19 December 2018, President Trump announced that he ordered the pullout of all 2,000-2,500 U.S. troops operating in Syria, though no clear timetable was given. U.S. operations in al-Tanf continued into 2019. Policy on Bashar al-Assad On 29 March 2017, during the Presidency of Donald Trump the United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson expressed that the longer term status of president Bashar al-Assad is to be \\"decided by the Syrian people\\". This appears as a policy shift, since under president Barack Obama’s administration, the US made the departure of Assad a key policy aim.In shift, Tillerson says Assad’s status up to Syrian people - AFP March 30, 2017 On March 30, 2017, United States Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley reaffirmed that the priority of the United States policy concerning Bashar al- Assad is to no longer force him out of power. On 7 April 2017 US missiles destroyed Shayrat Air Base in Homs Governorate which US military claimed to be the base for the aircraft that carried out the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack three days earlier. In April 2018, The US, The U.K. and France carried out missile strikes against Assad's compounds in response to the Douma chemical attack. On 17 June 2020, reports claimed that the US imposed tough new economic sanctions under the Caesar Act, targeting anyone doing business with the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from anywhere in the world. The sanctions were imposed to compel the Syrian government to halt its human rights abuses on civilians and accept a peaceful political transition. For the first time, the US has targeted Bashar al-Assad's wife, Asma al-Assad, claiming that she is \\"one of Syria's most notorious war profiteers\\".

The bilateral relationship between the two states is the subject of China–United States relations before the government led by the Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party) retreated to Taiwan and its neighboring islands as a result of the Chinese Civil War and until the U.S. ceased recognizing the ROC in 1979 as \\"China\\" and started referring to it as \\"Taiwan\\". Prior to relations with the ROC, the United States had diplomatic relations with the Qing dynasty beginning on until 1912. After the United States established diplomatic relations with the Beijing government, or People's Republic of China (PRC), under the Communist Party of China's rule as \\"China\\" in 1979, the Taiwan–United States relations became unofficial and informal. Until , informal relations between the two states were governed by the U.S. Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), which allows the United States to have relations with the \\"people on Taiwan\\" and their government, whose name is not specified. U.S.–Taiwan relations were further informally grounded in the \\"Six Assurances\\" in response to the third communiqué on the establishment of US–PRC relations. Following the passage of the Taiwan Travel Act by the U.S. Congress on March 16, 2018, relations between the United States and Taiwan have since maneuvered to an official and high-level basis. Both sides have since signed a consular agreement formalizing their existent consular relations on September 13, 2019. The policy of deliberate ambiguity of US foreign policy to Taiwan is important to stabilize cross-strait relations and to assist Taiwan from an invasion by the PRC if possible, whereas a policy of strategic clarity on Taiwan would likely induce PRC opposition and challenges to US legitimacy in East Asia or beyond. As stipulated by the TRA, the United States continues to be the main provider of arms to Taiwan, which is often a source tension with the PRC. Both states maintain representative offices functioning as de facto embassies. Taiwan is represented by the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States, and the United States by the American Institute in Taiwan. History =Taiwan under Qing & Japanese rule (Pre–1945)= United States Consulate in Taihoku, Formosa Two American diplomats in the 1850s suggested to Washington that the U.S. should obtain the island of Taiwan from China, but the idea was rejected.Leonard Gordon, \\"Early American Relations with Formosa, 1849–1870.\\" Historian 19.3 (1957): 262-289 at pp 271-77. Aboriginals on Taiwan often attacked and massacred shipwrecked western sailors, and American diplomats tried to help them.Leonard Gordon, \\"Early American Relations with Formosa, 1849–1870.\\" at pp 264-68. In 1867, during the Rover incident, Taiwanese aborigines attacked shipwrecked American sailors, killing the entire crew. They subsequently skirmished against and defeated a retaliatory expedition by the American military and killed another American during the battle. In the Japanese era, the United States also hosted a consulate in Taihoku, Formosa (today Taipei) from 1913. The consulate was closed in 1941 due to United States declaration of war on Japan. The site is now protected as the Former American Consulate in Taipei. =ROC on Taiwan= Beiyang and Nationalist era In 1784, the United States attempted to send a consul to China, but this was rejected by the Chinese government, with official relations beginning on June 16, 1844 under President John Tyler, leading to the 1845 Treaty of Wangxia. As Taiwan was under Japanese control, following the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, which overthrew the Qing dynasty, the William Taft administration recognized the government of the Republic of China (ROC) as the sole and legitimate government of China despite a number of governments ruling various parts of China. China was reunified by a single government, led by the Kuomintang (KMT) in 1928, which subsequently gained recognition as China's only legitimate government despite continued internal strife. The first winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature for writing about China was an American, born in the United States but raised in China, Pearl S. Buck, whose 1938 Nobel lecture was titled The Chinese Novel.Pearl S. Buck (1938), The Chinese Novel: Lecture Delivered before the Swedish Academy at Stockholm, December 12, 1938, by Pearl S. Buck. During the Pacific War, the United States and the Republic of China were allied against Japan. In October 1945, a month after Japan's surrender, representatives of Chiang Kai-shek, on behalf of the Allies, were sent to Formosa to accept the surrender of Japanese troops. However, during the period of the 1940s, there was no recognition by the United States Government that Taiwan had ever been incorporated into Chinese national territory. Chiang continued to remain suspicious of America's motives. =Retreat to Taiwan= Eisenhower, Soong Mei-ling, and Chinese president Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan. 1960. As the Korean War broke out, the Truman Administration resumed economic and military aid to the ROC on Taiwan and neutralized the Taiwan Strait by United States Seventh Fleet to stop a Communist invasion of Formosa (as well as a potential ROC counter-invasion of the mainland). US military presence in Taiwan consisted of the Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) and the United States Taiwan Defense Command (USTDC). Other notable units included the 327th Air Division. Until the US formally recognized the People's Republic of China in 1979, Washington provided ROC with financial grants based on the Foreign Assistance Act, Mutual Security Act and Act for International Development enacted by the US Congress. A separate Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty was signed between the two governments of US and ROC in 1954 and lasted until 1979. The U.S. State Department's official position in 1959 was: :That the provisional capital of the Republic of China has been at Taipei, Taiwan (Formosa) since December 1949; that the Government of the Republic of China exercises authority over the island; that the sovereignty of Formosa has not been transferred to China; and that Formosa is not a part of China as a country, at least not as yet, and not until and unless appropriate treaties are hereafter entered into. Formosa may be said to be a territory or an area occupied and administered by the Government of the Republic of China, but is not officially recognized as being a part of the Republic of China. Since 1979 Taiwan representative office in Washington, D.C., United States At the height of the Sino-Soviet Split, and at the start of the reform and opening of People's Republic of China, the United States strategically switched diplomatic recognition from the Republic of China (ROC) to the People's Republic of China (PRC) on January 1, 1979 to counter the political influences and military threats from the Soviet Union. The US Embassy in Taipei was 'migrated' to Beijing and the Taiwanese Embassy in the US was closed. Following the termination of diplomatic relations, the United States terminated its Mutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan on January 1, 1980. On April 10, 1979, U.S. President Jimmy Carter signed into law the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), which created domestic legal authority for the conduct of unofficial relations with Taiwan. U.S. commercial, cultural, and other interaction with the people on Taiwan is facilitated through the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), a private nonprofit corporation. The institute has its headquarters in the Washington, DC area and has offices in Taipei and Kaohsiung. It is authorized to issue visas, accept passport applications, and provide assistance to U.S. citizens in Taiwan. A counterpart organization, the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States (TECRO), has been established by Taiwan. It has its headquarters in Taipei, the representative branch office in Washington, DC, and 11 other Taipei Economic and Cultural Offices (TECO) in the continental U.S. and Guam. The Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) continues to provide the legal basis for the unofficial relationship between the U.S. and Taiwan, and enshrines the U.S. commitment to assisting Taiwan maintain its defensive capability. In July 2002, Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan (陳定南) became the first Taiwanese government official to be invited into the White House after the US had de-recognized Taiwan. After de-recognition, the U.S. still maintains unofficial diplomatic relations with Taiwan through Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office; the current head of TECRO in Washington, D.C. is Stanley Kao. The American Institute in Taiwan, a non- profit institute headquarters in the US soil under the laws of the District of Columbia in Arlington County, Virginia and serves as the semi-official, working-level US representation and AIT has branch offices in Taipei and Kaohsiung. The Chairman of AIT is Raymond Burghardt. Christopher J. Marut was appointed to be the new AIT Taipei Office Director in August 2012. With the absence of diplomatic recognition, in the present state, Taiwan-US relations are formally guided by the service of enactment of Taiwan Relations Act by US Congress for the continuation of Taiwan-US relations after 1979. In 2013, Taiwan Policy Act of 2013 was raised and passed in House Committee on Foreign Affairs by the US Congress to update the condition of US-Taiwan relations. In 2015 Kin Moy was appointed to the Director of the AIT. U.S. commercial ties with Taiwan have been maintained and have expanded since 1979. Taiwan continues to enjoy Export-Import Bank financing, Overseas Private Investment Corporation guarantees, normal trade relations (NTR) status, and ready access to U.S. markets. In recent years, AIT commercial dealings with Taiwan have focused on expanding market access for American goods and services. AIT has been engaged in a series of trade discussions, which have focused on copyright concerns and market access for U.S. goods and services. On December 16, 2015, the Obama administration announced a deal to sell $1.83 billion worth of arms to the Armed Forces of Taiwan, a year and eight months after U.S. House passed the Taiwan Relations Act Affirmation and Naval Vessel Transfer Act of 2014 to allow the sale of Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates to Taiwan. The deal would include the sale of two decommissioned U.S. Navy frigates, anti-tank missiles, Assault Amphibious Vehicles, and FIM-92 Stinger surface-to-air missiles, amid the territorial disputes in the South China Sea. China's foreign ministry had expressed its disapproval for the sales and issued the U.S. a \\"stern warning\\", saying it would hurt China–U.S. relations. A new $250 million compound for the American Institute in Taiwan was unveiled in June 2018, accompanied by a \\"low- key\\" American delegation. The Chinese authorities estimated this action as violation of \\"one China\\" policy statement and claimed the US to stop any relations with Taiwan without approbation of China. In September 2018, the United States approved the sale of $330 million worth of spare parts and other equipment to sustain the Republic of China Air Force. In July 2019, the US State Department approved the sale of M1A2T Abrams tanks, Stinger missiles and related equipment at an approximate value of $2.2 billion to Taiwan. In May 2020, the US State Department approved a possible Foreign Military Sale of 18 MK-48 Mod 6 Advanced Technology Heavy Weight Torpedoes for Taiwan in a deal estimated to cost $180 million. On 9 August 2020, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar visited Taiwan to meet President Tsai Ing-wen, the first visit by an American official since the break in diplomatic relations between Washington and Taipei in 1979. In September 2020, U.S. Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment Keith J. Krach attended the memorial service for former Taiwanese President Lee Teng- hui. Notable issues In 1949, when Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's troops decamped to Taiwan at the end of the Chinese civil war, Washington continued to recognize Chiang's \\"Republic of China\\" as the government of all China. In late 1978, Washington announced that it would break relations with the government in Taipei and formally recognize the People's Republic of China (PRC) as the \\"sole legal government of China.\\" Taiwan welcomes U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1960 Washington's \\"one China\\" policy, however, does not mean that the United States recognizes, nor agrees with Beijing's claims to sovereignty over Taiwan. On July 14, 1982 the Republican Reagan Administration gave specific assurances to Taiwan that the United States did not accept China's claim to sovereignty over the island (Six Assurances),For a detailed description of the U.S. \\"one China\\" stance, see Ambassador Harvey Feldman, \\"A Primer on U.S. Policy Toward the 'One-China' Issue: Questions and Answers,\\" Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 1429, April 12, 2001. and the U.S. Department of State informed the Senate that \\"[t]he United States takes no position on the question of Taiwan's sovereignty.\\" The U.S. Department of State, in its U.S. Relations With Taiwan fact sheet, states \\"[T]he United States and Taiwan enjoy a robust unofficial relationship. The 1979 U.S.–P.R.C. Joint Communiqué switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. In the Joint Communiqué, the United States recognized the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China, acknowledging the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China. The United States position on Taiwan is reflected in \\"the six assurances to Taiwan\\", the Three Communiqués, and the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA). The Six Assurances include: 1\\\\. The United States has not agreed to set a date for ending arms sales to Taiwan; 2\\\\. The United States has not agreed to hold prior consultations with the Chinese on arms sales to Taiwan; 3\\\\. The United States would not play any mediation role between Taiwan and Beijing; 4\\\\. The United States has not agreed to revise the Taiwan Relations Act; 5\\\\. The United States has not altered its position regarding sovereignty over Taiwan; and 6\\\\. The United States would not exert pressure on Taiwan to enter into negotiations with the Chinese.Testimony of John H. Holdridge, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs, in hearing, China-Taiwan: United States Policy, Committee on Foreign Affairs, U.S. House of Representatives, 97th Cong., 2nd Sess., August 18, 1982, pp. 15-16. Holdridge described the Six Assurances in his memoir, Crossing the Divide, p. 232. The \\"Three Communiqués\\" include The Shanghai Communiqué, The Normalisation Communiqué, and The August 17 Communiqué, which pledged to abrogate official US-ROC relations, remove US troops from Taiwan and gradually end the arms sale to Taiwan, but with the latter of no timeline to do so, an effort made by James Lilley, the Director of American Institute in Taiwan. President John F. Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon Johnson meet with Chen Cheng, Vice President of the Republic of China, 31 July 1961 Despite friendly relations with China, United States President George W. Bush was asked on 25 April 2001, \\"if Taiwan were attacked by China, do we (The U.S.) have an obligation to defend the Taiwanese?\\" He responded, \\"Yes, we do...and the Chinese must understand that. The United States would do whatever it took to help Taiwan defend herself.\\" He made it understood that \\"though we (China and the U.S.) have common interests, the Chinese must understand that there will be some areas where we disagree.\\" Then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Ash Carter greets Taiwan representative to the U.S. Jason Yuan and Vice Minister of Defense Andrew Yang before a meeting at The Pentagon on October 2, 2012 On 19 June 2013, ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed gratitude for a US Congress's bill in support of Taiwan's bid to participate in the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). On July 12, 2013, US President Barack Obama signed into law H.R. 1151, codifying the US government's full support for Taiwan's participation in the ICAO as a non- sovereign entity. The United States has continued the sale of appropriate defensive military equipment to Taiwan in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act, which provides for such sales and which declares that peace and stability in the area are in U.S. interests. Sales of defensive military equipment are also consistent with the 1982 U.S.-P.R.C. Joint Communiqué. Maintaining diplomatic relations with the PRC has been recognised to be in the long-term interest of the United States by seven consecutive administrations; however, maintaining strong, unofficial relations with Taiwan is also a major U.S. goal, in line with its desire to further peace and stability in Asia. In keeping with its China policy, the U.S. does not support de jure Taiwan independence, but it does support Taiwan's membership in appropriate international organisations, such as the World Trade Organization, Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, and the Asian Development Bank, where statehood is not a requirement for membership. In addition, the U.S. supports appropriate opportunities for Taiwan's voice to be heard in organisations where its membership is not possible. On 24 August 2010, the United States State Department announced a change to commercial sales of military equipment in place of the previous foreign military sales in the hope of avoiding political implications.ROC Central News Agency U.S. arms sales to return to normal track: Taiwan official However pressure from the PRC has continued and it seems unlikely that Taiwan will be provided with advanced submarines or jet fighters.Waldron, Greg. \\"Outlook gloomy for Taiwan F-16 C/D deal.\\" Flight International, May 26, 2011. Taiwan has indicated that it is willing to host national missile defense radars to be tied into the American system, but is unwilling to pay for any further cost overruns in the systems.\\"Taiwan rejects further advanced radar system price hikes.\\" CNA, June 14, 2011. Tsai Ing-wen (center), President of the Republic of China (Taiwan), accompanied by Secretary-General of National Security Council Joseph Wu (left) and Foreign Minister David Lee (right), made a phone call to Donald Trump, President-elect of the United States, on December 2, 2016. On December 2, 2016, U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump accepted a congratulatory call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-Wen, which was the first time since 1979 that a President-Elect has publicly spoken to a leader of Taiwan. Donald Trump stated the call was regarding \\"the close economic, political and security ties between Taiwan and the US\\". The phone call had been arranged by Bob Dole, who acted as a foreign agent on behalf of Taiwan. PRC Foreign Minister Wang Yi soon made a statement saying that China opposes any move to separate the country, without explicitly mentioning the phone call between Tsai and Trump. On 16 March 2018, President Trump signed the Taiwan Travel Act, allowing high- level diplomatic engagement between Taiwanese and American officials, and encourages visits between government officials of the United States and Taiwan at all levels. The legislation has sparked outrage from the PRC, and has been applauded by Taiwan. On 17 July 2018, Taiwan's Army was officially commissioned all of its Apache attack helicopters purchased from the United States, at cost of $59.31 billion NT(US$1.94 billion), having completed the necessary pilot training and verification of the fleet's combat capability. One of the helicopters was destroyed in a crash during a training flight in Taoyuan in April 2014 and the other 29 have been allocated to the command's 601st Brigade, which is based in Longtan, Taoyuan. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen said the commissioning of the Apaches was \\"an important milestone\\" in meeting the island's \\"multiple deterrence\\" strategy to counter an invasion and to resist Beijing's pressure with support from Washington, which has been concerned about Beijing's growing military expansion in the South China Sea and beyond. On 26 March 2020, President Trump signed the TAIPEI Act, aiming to increase the scope of US relations with Taiwan and encouraging other nations and international organizations to strengthen their official and unofficial ties with the island nation. Consular Representation The United States operates a de-facto embassy in Taipei called the American Institute in Taiwan. It operates a consulate in Kaohsiung called the American Institute in Taiwan Kaohsiung Branch Office. Taiwan operates several diplomatic missions in the United States, with the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States located in Washington, D.C. This mission is also accredited to Cuba, the Bahamas, Grenada, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, and Trinidad and Tobago, despite Taiwan not having relations with them. Other than the mission in Washington, Taiwan also operates consulates in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Honolulu, Houston, Miami, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Denver. Taiwan formerly operated a consulate in Guam.

According to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, 44% of Tajiks approve of U.S. leadership, with 38% disapproving and 18% uncertain.U.S. Global Leadership Project Report - 2012 Gallup Overview The United States remains committed to assisting Tajikistan in its economic and political development, as Tajikistan continues to recover from its civil war legacy. U.S. assistance efforts are evolving away from humanitarian aid and political reconciliation, as those needs increasingly have been met. Instead, their efforts are targeted toward broader goals of democratic and economic reforms. U.S.–Tajik relations have developed considerably since September 11, 2001. The two countries now have a broad- based relationship, cooperating in such areas as counter-narcotics, counter- terrorism, non-proliferation, and regional growth and stability. In light of the Russian border forces' withdrawal from the Tajik–Afghan border, the U.S. Government leads an international donor effort to enhance Tajikistan's territorial integrity, prevent the transit of narcotics and material or technology related to weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and support a stable, peaceful Tajikistan in order to prevent the spread of influence and activities of radical groups and terrorists.

They continue to assist Tajikistan on economic reforms and integration into the broader global marketplace, for example in pursuing World Trade Organization (WTO) accession. Tajikistan has been a strong supporter of U.S. efforts in the war on terrorism and in promoting peace and stability in Afghanistan.

The bridge enhance economic and commercial opportunities on both sides of the river, allowing goods and people to move across more easily. On the Afghan side, the bridge road will connect to the Afghan Ring Road, which is being built with international assistance primarily via the Asian Development Bank. The United States recognized Tajikistan on December 25, 1991, the day the U.S.S.R. dissolved, and opened a temporary Embassy in a hotel in the capital, Dushanbe, in March 1992. After the bombings of U.S. Embassies in Africa in 1998, Embassy Dushanbe American personnel were temporarily relocated to Almaty, Kazakhstan, due to heightened Embassy security standards.

History  Much of the relationship between Tanzania and the United States has been framed first by the Cold War, and more recently in the context of US policies toward Africa and development. At times relations between the two countries have been tense, though in recent years the two countries have established a growing partnership. Much early tension in the relationship is rooted in Tanzania's interests in promoting anti- colonial liberation forces in southern Africa, and the United States interests in protecting markets and business interests in Africa. These interests were often in conflict between 1961, and the late 1980s. Since the late 1980s, relations between the United States and Tanzania have improved as a result of mutual interests in debt relief, successive refugee crises, the liberation of southern African countries, and an improving Tanzanian economy (see Waters 2006). US President Barack Obama meeting his Tanzanian counterpart Jakaya Kikwete in the Oval office in May 2009. Ambassador Mark B. Childress presenting his credentials to President Kikwete. Terrorists associated with Al Qaeda bombed the U.S. Embassies in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi, Kenya, on August 7, 1998. This act horrified Tanzanians and Americans alike and also drew condemnation from around the world. In the aftermath of the bombing, Tanzania began to receive financial aide from the US for anti-terrorist efforts and police training. President Benjamin Mkapa visited the U.S. in September 1999 with a delegation of business executives, reflecting the increased level of cooperation on trade and investment issues and Tanzania's commitment to economic liberalization. President Jakaya Kikwete, who was elected in 2005, visited the U.S. in May 2006, meeting with Secretary of State Rice, Vice President Dick Cheney, and, briefly, President George W. Bush. He met President Bush in a private meeting in September 2006 In New York. Kikwete sought to broaden Tanzanian ties to the U.S. across all spheres, including political, economic, and military. The U.S. Government provides assistance to Tanzania to support programs in the areas of health, environment, democracy, and development of the private sector. The U.S. Agency for International Development's program in Tanzania averages about $20 million per year, a relatively small amount (see Waters 2006). The Peace Corps program, which discontinued in Tanzania due to objections to the United States involvement in the Vietnam War in the 1960s, was re-established in 1979, and provides assistance in education through the provision of teachers. Peace Corps also is assisting in health and environment sectors. Currently, about 147 volunteers are serving in Tanzania. First Lady Laura Bush visited Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar in mid-July 2005.

According to a 2012 Gallup public opinion poll, 60% of Thais approved of U.S. leadership under the Obama Administration, with 14% disapproving and 26% uncertain.Snapshot: U.S. Leadership Unknown in Myanmar Gallup As of 2013, there were 7314 international students of Thai origin studying in the United States, representing 0.9 percent of all foreigners pursuing higher education in America.TOP 25 PLACES OF ORIGIN OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS Institute of International Education According to a 2014 Global Opinion Poll, 73% of Thais have a favorable view of the U.S, compared to 15% unfavorable.Global Indicators Database. History =19th century= The first recorded contact between Thailand (then known as Siam) and the United States came in 1818, when an American ship captain visited the country, bearing a letter from U.S. President James Monroe. Chang and Eng Bunker immigrated in the early 1830s. In 1832, President Andrew Jackson sent his envoy Edmund Roberts in the U.S. sloop-of-war Peacock, to the courts of Cochin-China, Siam and Muscat. Roberts concluded a Treaty of Amity and Commerce on March 20, 1833, with the Chao-Phraya Phra Klang representing King Phra Nang Klao; ratifications exchanged April 14, 1836; proclaimed June 24, 1837. Naval surgeon William Ruschenberger accompanied the return mission for exchange of ratifications. His account and that of Mr. Roberts were collected, edited and re-published as Two Yankee Diplomats In 1830s Siam. The 150th anniversary of Roberts' mission was marked by in 1982 by issuance of the first edition of The Eagle and the Elephant: Thai-American relations since 1833, followed by multiple re-issues including a 1987 royal celebration edition and a 1997 golden jubilee edition. This was affirmed by former prime minister Samak Sundaravej, who in 2008, met George W. Bush on the \\"occasion of the celebration of 175th anniversary of Thai–American relations.\\" Thailand is thus the first Asian nation to have a formal diplomatic agreement with the United States; eleven years before the Great Qing and twenty-one years before Tokugawa Japan. In May 1856, Townsend Harris, a representative of President Franklin Pierce, negotiated a modified Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with representatives of King Mongkut (later Rama IV) that granted Americans additional extraterritorial rights. Stephen Mattoon, an American missionary who acted as Harris's translator, was appointed the first United States consul (representative) to Siam. (Rodgers and Hammerstein's play The King and I mentions in passing that the King plans to send war elephants to assist President Lincoln in his Great War. The actual letter sent by King Mongkut after receiving presents from the United States was addressed to the President when James Buchanan was in office, to offer elephants for breeding stock, not war; the offer was received by Lincoln, who courteously declined.) Sempronius H. Boyd, the third Minister Resident/Consular General to Siam On the occasion of the 150th anniversary of relations, it was revealed that President Andrew Jackson had given the king (later known as Rama III) a gold sword with a design of an elephant and an eagle chased on a gold handle. The king had also been presented a proof set of American coins, which included the \\"King of Siam\\" 1804 dollar struck in 1834. The set, minus a Jackson gold medal, was purchased for a record price of US$8.5 million by Steven L. Contursi, President of Rare Coin Wholesalers of Irvine, California on November 1, 2005. The set had been sold by Goldberg Coins & Collectibles of Beverly Hills, California, on behalf of an anonymous owner described as \\"a West Coast business executive,\\" who purchased it for over US$4 million four years before. =Early 20th century= Following the death of General Advisor in Foreign Affairs Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns in 1902, Phya Suriyanuwat, the Siamese Minister in Paris, was instructed to find a replacement. Phya Suriya was unable to find a suitable candidate in Europe, and notified Phya Akaraj Varathon, the Siamese Minister in Washington, that under the circumstances, he had decided to engage an American. In 1903, former US diplomat Edward Henry Strobel took a leave of absence from his position as the Bemis Professor of International Law at Harvard School of Law to represent the Kingdom of Siam in The Hague at the International Peace Court—which Rolin-Jaequemyns had been instrumental in founding. In 1906, Strobel moved to Bangkok to take the position of general advisor, where he died January 15, 1908. Among his successors were Jens Westengard, 1909–14, Wolcott Pitkin, 1915-17, Eldon James, and Francis B. Sayre—all but for Pitkin former Harvard law professors. \\"The Siamese government trusted the American Adviser in Foreign Affairs to act in the best interests of Siam. Authority and responsibility were delegated to him. He was permitted a considerable degree of freedom in his work. It was in his capacity as a lawyer, a jurist, an advocate, and a policy counselor that the American adviser contributed significantly to the successful conclusion of the treaty negotiations with the West. The first U.S. White House state dinner of the twentieth century, and just the second White House state dinner ever, occurred in April of 1931, while King Prajadhipok was visiting America in order to get eye surgery. \\" An agreement on relations between the two countries was signed in Washington D.C. on December 16, 1920.Text in League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 6, pp. 292-305. =Treaty of Amity (1966)= Thaksin Shinawatra and Surakiart Sathirathai meeting with former U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on 19 September 2005 Since World War II, the United States and Thailand have developed close relations, as reflected in several bilateral treaties and by both countries' participation in UN multilateral activities and agreements. The principal bilateral arrangement is the 1966 Treaty of Amity and Economic Relations, which facilitates U.S. and Thai companies' economic access to one another's markets. Other important agreements address civil uses of atomic energy, sales of agricultural commodities, investment guarantees, and military and economic assistance. =Proposed FTA (2004–present)= 180 years of Thai US relations logo In June 2004 the United States and Thailand initiated negotiations on a free trade agreement which, when concluded, will reduce and eliminate barriers to trade and investment between the two countries. These negotiations were placed on hold following the dissolution of the Thai parliament in February 2006 and the subsequent coup in September. The new military government issued compulsory licenses for several anti-HIV drugs, effectively ending the FTA negotiations.Channel News Asia. 2008, August 5. \\"US president's visit to Thailand will likely focus on Myanmar\\".

Pompeo meets with Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha on August 2, 2019 On 22 May 2014, the Royal Thai Armed Forces, led by General Prayut Chan- o-cha, Commander of the Royal Thai Army (RTA), launched a coup d'état against the caretaker government of Thailand, following six months of political crisis. US Secretary of State John Kerry issued a statement condemning the coup, saying that he was \\"disappointed\\" by the army's decision and \\"this act will have negative implications for the U.S.–Thai relationship, especially for our relationship with the Thai military\\". Security cooperation U.S. President George W. Bush meets with Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra of Thailand in the Oval Office Dec. 14, 2001. The two leaders discussed economic issues and the war on terrorism The United States and Thailand are among the signatories of the 1954 Manila pact of the former Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). Article IV(1) of this treaty provides that, in the event of armed attack in the treaty area (which includes Thailand), each member would \\"act to meet the common danger in accordance with its constitutional processes.\\" Despite the dissolution of the SEATO in 1977, the Manila pact remains in force and, together with the Thanat-Rusk communiqué of 1962, constitutes the basis of U.S. security commitments to Thailand. Thailand continues to be a key security ally in Asia, along with Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea. In December 2003, Thailand was designated a Major non-NATO ally (MNNA). Thailand has received U.S. military equipment, essential supplies, training, and assistance in the construction and improvement of facilities and installations for much of the period since 1950. Over recent decades, U.S. security assistance included military training programs carried out in the United States and elsewhere. A small U.S. military advisory group in Thailand oversaw the delivery of equipment to the Royal Thai Armed Forces and the training of Thai military personnel in its use and maintenance. Funding for the International Military Education and Training and the Foreign Military Financing programs, along with selected other programs totaling US$29 million, was suspended following the September 19, 2006 coup d'état in Thailand. As part of their mutual defense cooperation over the last decade, Thailand and the United States have developed a vigorous joint military exercise program, which engages all the services of each nation and averages 40 joint exercises per year. Thailand's U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield is currently the \\"only facility in Southeast Asia capable of supporting large-scale logistical operations\\". Thailand has allowed the US to use U-Tapao to land and refuel after traveling across the Pacific Ocean on the way to US operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Economic relations Abhisit Vejjajiva, Pimpen Vejjajiva, U.S. President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama on 23 September 2009, in New York =Foreign assistance= Economic assistance has been extended in various fields, including rural development, health, family planning, education, and science and technology. The formal U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) program ended in 1995. However, there are a number of targeted assistance programs which continue in areas of mutually defined importance, including: health and HIV/AIDS programming; refugee assistance; and trafficking in persons. The U.S. Peace Corps in Thailand has approximately 100 volunteers, focused on primary education, with an integrated program involving teacher training, health education, and environmental education. =Trade= The United States is Thailand's third largest trading partner after Japan and China. In 2006 merchandise imports from Thailand totalled US$22.5 billion, and merchandise exports totalled US$8.2 billion. The U.S., Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, and the European Union are among Thailand's largest foreign investors. American investment, concentrated in the petroleum and chemicals, finance, consumer products, and automobile production sectors, is estimated at US$21 billion. Current bilateral issues =Counter-narcotics= Golden Triangle. Thailand remains a trafficking route for narcotics from the Golden Triangle—the intersection of Burma, Laos, and Thailand—to both the domestic Thai and international markets. The large-scale production and shipment of opium and heroin shipments from Burma of previous years have largely been replaced by widespread smuggling of methamphetamine tablets (ya ba), although heroin seizures along the border continue to take place with some frequency. The United States and Thailand work closely together and with the United Nations on a broad range of programs to halt illicit drug trafficking and use and other criminal activity. The U.S. supports the International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) in Bangkok, which provides counter-narcotics and anti-crime capacity-building programs to law enforcement and judicial officials from a number of regional countries. According to Barry McCaffrey, a US four-star general, \\"the excellent U.S.-Thai counter-narcotics relationship has been an enormous success and stimulus for greater regional cooperation\\".Barry R. McCaffrey. May 1997 \\"The Opium Kings\\". =War on terrorism= Multinational service members stand in formation during the opening ceremony for Exercise Cobra Gold at the Royal Thai Marine Corps Headquarters in Sattahip, Thailand Thailand has been important to the US war on terrorism, \\"providing access to military facilities, sharing information on the movements of terrorist organizations and suspected terrorists, offering military engineering and medical personnel to support reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan\\".Xinhua. 2003, June 2. \\"News Analysis: Thai-US ties on an even keel despite difference on Iraq war\\". The most visible element of this cooperation was a joint operation between the CIA and Thai police which captured Riduan Isamuddin (better known by his nom de guerre, Hambali) in 2003. According to Shawn Crispin, the Asia Times Southeast Asia editor, Thailand represents one of the U.S.'s \\"once strong, now strained bilateral alliances\\".Shawn W Crispin. 2008, September 7. \\"What Obama means to Bangkok\\". Crispin surmises that the long history of bilateral cooperation and Thai fears of China's rise enabled Bush to have \\"his way with Thailand\\". The US war on terror combined with Thailand's southern Islamic insurgency has created tension, particularly with Thailand's People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD). The U.S. has pressured and enabled Thailand to crack down on the insurgency with more proactive military force.Gunarantna et al., 2005, pp. 94–96. In 2008, Thai courts refused to turn over Jamshid Ghassemi, an Iranian national accused of missile parts smuggling to the US, the \\"first-ever failed extradition\\" between Thailand and the US.Shawn W. Crispin. 2009, February 14. \\"When allies drift apart\\". US-Thai friction also increased when Thailand refused to quickly extradite Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, according to Crispin, signalling that \\"Washington is slowly but surely losing influence over its long time strategic ally\\". Crispin viewed it as \\"no doubt significant\\" that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton chose to visit Indonesia, but not Thailand, on her first trip to Southeast Asia. =Rice subsidies= Rice production in Thailand employs approximately two-thirds of the population, causing friction over US rice subsidies Since the 1980s, US farm subsidies for rice, along with copyright and patent issues, have constituted the \\"major problems in U.S.-Thai trade ties\\".Kenneth J. Conboy. 1988, March 8. \\"Cracks Appear in the U.S.-Thai Relationship\\". Heritage Asian Studies Backgrounder #75. The rice subsidy was one of the primary obstacles to the negotiation of a bilateral FTA.Bangkok Post. 2005, July 11. \\"Free or even fair? \\". Approximately two-thirds of Thailand's population are rice farmers, and the U.S. subsidy \\"severely strains U.S.-Thai relations as Bangkok finds itself unable to explain the income lost to its 35 million rice farmers\\". USDA-funded research to produce variants of Jasmine rice capable of growing in the US are viewed as biopiracy by many Thai rice farmers.Steward, Gene and Roggemann, Ellen. 2005. \\"\\". ENGAGE In 2005, Thai rice farmers gathered outside the US embassy to chant a \\"traditional ritual to bring misfortune to enemies\\". Farmer protests also occurred outside the US embassy during the 2001 WTO ministerial meeting in Doha.AFP. 2001, November 9. \\"WTO-Thailand-protest: Thai farmers and activists rally against WTO, US\\". Thai officials \\"sharply criticized\\" the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, and retaliated by joining two WTO dispute resolution cases against the US: one against anti- dumping subsidy offsets, and the Shrimp-Turtle Case.Wayne M. Morrison. 2003, March 28. \\"Thailand-U.S. Economic Relations: An Overview\\". Congressional Research Service. According to Oxfam, the US spends US$1.3 billion on rice subsidies annually for a crop that costs US$1.8 billion to grow, allowing the US to become the second largest global rice exporter (after Thailand) and dump rice at 34 percent below the cost of production. Following the election of Obama and the 2008 global financial crisis, there are Thai fears of renewed US protectionism. =China's rise= According to Stratfor, \\"Bangkok's support could prove pivotal for the United States in the years to come, as it presses war against militant Islamic groups in the region and prepares for the expansion of Chinese power\\".Stratfor. 2003, October 18. \\"U.S.-Thai Relations To Improve Bangkok's Regional Standing.\\" According to Crispin, however, it is \\"clear that Thailand fails to share the US's threat perception of China's rapid regional rise\\", trying to maintain strong relations with both the United States and China. In the words of one analyst, \\"Despite being both a bilateral and multilateral US treaty ally, as well as holding major non-NATO status, Thailand has hardly factored into Washington's regional strategy.\\" Since the Thai military coup in 2014 China has become Thailand's leading trading partner and its second largest source of foreign investment. Thailand's military budget for FY2017 includes the purchase of at least one Chinese submarine and Chinese armoured vehicles. China's premier became the first foreign national ever to address Thailand's parliament. Joint naval and marine exercises have been added to Sino-Thai army drills begun under Prime Minister Thaksin. Embassies The U.S. maintains an embassy in Bangkok, one of the largest in the world, and a consulate in the northern city of Chiang Mai.

It is referred to as a \\"black site\\" as its existence is not acknowledged by the US government. Every Thai government since 2002 has also denied its existence. The site has been variously referred to as \\"Detention Site Green\\" and \\"Cat's Eye\\". Its whereabouts has remained secret despite media efforts to uncover its location. Some experts believe it was at a US installation in Udon Thani Province. Some say it was at an air base southeast of Bangkok used by US forces as a refueling hub for flights to Afghanistan. Others point to a section of Bangkok's Don Mueang International Airport controlled by the Royal Thai Air Force. The site was reportedly closed down in December 2002.

Togo is a pro-Western, market-oriented country. The United States and Togo have had generally good relations since its independence, although the United States has never been one of Togo's major trading partners. The largest share of U.S. exports to Togo generally has been used clothing and scrap textiles. Other important U.S. exports include rice, wheat, shoes, and tobacco products, and U.S. personal computers and other office electronics are becoming more widely used. Embassy of the United States to Togo The Government of Togo, with the support of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), established an export processing zone (EPZ) in Togo in 1989. The zone has attracted private investors interested in manufacturing, assembly, and food processing, primarily for the export market. USAID closed its local office in 1994 and runs local development programs from its office in Accra through nongovernmental organizations in Togo. The Peace Corps began its work in Togo in 1962. Since that time, more than 2,200 Peace Corps Volunteers have served in the country. Currently there are 114 Volunteers serving in Togo. Volunteers have a successful history of collaboration and involvement with the Togolese people at all levels. Their efforts build upon counterpart relationships and emphasize low-cost solutions that make maximum use of local resources. Partnering with local and international organizations is an important component of Volunteer project activities. Volunteers work to promote self-sufficiency in the areas of small business development, education, environment, and health. All Volunteers, regardless of sector, are trained in how to promote HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention. The U.S. maintains an embassy in Lomé.

Embassy of the United States in Port of Spain Trinidad and Tobago – United States relations are bilateral relations between Trinidad and Tobago and the United States. The United States and Trinidad and Tobago enjoy cordial relations. U.S. interests here and throughout the hemisphere focus on increasing investment and trade, and ensuring more stable supplies of energy. They also include enhancing Trinidad and Tobago's political and social stability and positive regional role through assistance in drug interdiction, health issues, and legal affairs. The U.S. embassy was established in Port of Spain in 1962, replacing the former consulate general.  Background  International Military Education and Training (IMET) and Foreign Military Financing (FMF) programs were suspended in 2003 under the terms of the American Service-Members' Protection Act (ASPA), because Trinidad and Tobago, a member of the International Criminal Court, had not concluded a bilateral non-surrender or \\"Article 98\\" agreement with the United States. However, when the Congress de- linked IMET funding from the Article 98 sanctions, a nominal allocation of $45,000 in IMET was reinstated for late 2007. Currently, the main source of financial assistance provided to the defense force is through the State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement funds, Traditional Commander's Activities funds, the State Partnership Program (with Delaware), and IMET. Assistance to Trinidad and Tobago from U.S. military, law enforcement authorities, and in the area of health issues remains important to the bilateral relationship and to accomplishing U.S. policy objectives. The U.S. Government also provides technical assistance to the Government of Trinidad and Tobago through a number of existing agreements. The Department of Homeland Security has a Customs Advisory Team working with the Ministry of Finance to update its procedures. Similarly, the Treasury Department had an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) advising team that worked with the Board of Inland Revenue modernizing its tax administration; this long-running project ended in October 2007. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a part of the Department of Health and Human Services, collaborates with the Trinidad-based Caribbean Epidemiology Center (CAREC) and other regional partners to provide technical assistance and financial support for HIV/AIDS-related epidemiological surveillance and public health training in the region. U.S. commercial ties with Trinidad and Tobago have always been strong and have grown substantially in the last several years due to economic liberalization. U.S. firms have invested more than a billion dollars in recent years—mostly in the petrochemical, oil/gas, and iron/steel sectors. Many of America's largest corporations have commercial links with Trinidad and Tobago, and more than 30 U.S. firms have offices and operations in the country. Trinidad and Tobago is a beneficiary of the U.S. Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI). The U.S. embassy actively fosters bilateral business ties and provides a number of commercial services to potential investors and traders. A double- taxation agreement has existed since the early 1970s. A tax information exchange agreement was signed in 1989, and a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) and an Intellectual Property Rights agreement were signed in 1994. The BIT entered into force in 1996. Other agreements include Extradition and Mutual Legal Assistance treaties, which have been in force since 1999. An agreement on Maritime Cooperation was signed in 1996. There are large numbers of U.S. citizens and permanent residents of Trinidadian origin living in the United States (mostly in New York and Florida), which keeps cultural ties strong. About 20,000 U.S. citizens visit Trinidad and Tobago on vacation or for business every year, and more than 4,600 American citizens are residents.

Couples Bourguiba and Kennedy in the White House. Tunisia – United States relations are bilateral relations between Tunisia and the United States. According to a 2012 global opinion poll, 45% of Tunisians view the U.S. favorably.Opinion of the United States  History  The United States has very good relations with Tunisia, which date back more than 200 years. The United States has maintained official representation in Tunis almost continuously since 1795, and the American Friendship Treaty with Tunisia was signed in 1799. The two governments are not linked by security treaties, but relations have been close since Tunisia's independence. U.S.-Tunisian relations suffered in 1985, after Israel bombed the PLO headquarters in Tunis. Believing the U.S. knew about the attack, and was possibly involved, Tunisia considered breaking diplomatic ties with the U.S. It didn't do so, after the U.S. explicitly dissociated itself from the actions of Israel. Relations also suffered as a result of the 1988 Tunis assassination of PLO nationalist Abu Jihad, and the Gulf War in 1990. Relations later warmed, reflecting strong bilateral ties. The United States and Tunisia have an active schedule of joint military exercises. U.S. security assistance historically has played an important role in cementing relations. The U.S.-Tunisian Joint Military Commission meets annually to discuss military cooperation, Tunisia's defense modernization program, and other security matters. The United States first provided economic and technical assistance to Tunisia under a bilateral agreement signed March 26, 1957. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) managed a program until its departure in 1994, when Tunisia's economic advances led to the country's \\"graduation\\" from USAID funding. Tunisia enthusiastically supported the U.S.-North African Economic Partnership (USNAEP), designed to promote U.S. investment in, and economic integration of, the Maghreb region. The program provided over $4 million in assistance to Tunisia between 2001 and 2003. The Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) was launched in 2002 and incorporated the former USNAEP economic reform projects while adding bilateral and regional projects for education reform, civil society development and women's empowerment. In 2004, the MEPI Regional Office opened in Embassy Tunis. The Regional Office is staffed by American diplomats and regional specialists. It is responsible for coordinating MEPI activities in Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia in close coordination with the American Embassies in those countries. The Embassy of Tunisia in Washington, D.C. American private assistance has been provided since independence by foundations, religious groups, universities, and philanthropic organizations. The U.S. Government has supported Tunisia's efforts to attract foreign investment. The United States and Tunisia concluded a bilateral investment treaty in 1990 and an agreement to avoid double taxation in 1989. In October 2002, the U.S. and Tunisia signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA), and in October 2003 held the first TIFA Council Meeting in Washington, DC. American firms seeking to invest in Tunisia and export to Tunisia can receive insurance and financing for their business through U.S. Government agencies, including the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the Export-Import Bank. The best prospects for foreigners interested in the Tunisian market are in high technology, energy, agribusiness, food processing, medical care and equipment, and the environmental and tourism sectors. As of February 2008, the principal U.S. Officials included: the Ambassador Robert F. Godec, Deputy Chief of Mission Marc Desjardins, Political/Economic Counselor Dorothy C. Shea, and Commercial Attaché Beth Mitchell. In June 2009, Gordon Gray III was named the next Ambassador to Tunisia from the United States, and served from August 2009 to July 2012. The U.S. maintains an embassy in Tunis.

However, the Government of Turkmenistan essentially removed itself from the negotiations in 2000 by refusing all offers by its commercial partners and making unrealistic demands for billion-dollar \\"pre-financing.\\" Following a tripartite summit with the presidents of Russia and Kazakhstan in May 2007 in which gas was a major topic, however, the new President Berdimuhamedow resurrected the idea of a Trans-Caspian gas pipeline, explicitly refusing to rule out the possibility of constructing such a pipeline in the future. Gurbanguly Berdimuhammedov with Barack and Michelle Obama The United States and Turkmenistan continue to disagree about the latter state's path toward democratic and economic reform. The United States has publicly advocated industrial privatization, market liberalization, and fiscal reform, as well as legal and regulatory reforms to open up the economy to foreign trade and investment, as the best way to achieve prosperity, true independence and sovereignty.

History There was limited interaction between U.S. citizens and the Tuvaluan people in the 19th century. American whaling ships were active in the waters of the Tuvaluan archipelago. In 1821 Captain George Barrett, of the Nantucket whaler Independence II, visited Niulakita, which he named Rocky (Group).Keith S. Chambers & Doug Munro, The Mystery of Gran Cocal: European Discovery and Mis-Discovery in Tuvalu, 89(2) (1980) The Journal of the Polynesian Society, 167-198 This name was never much used, but Independence Island, after Barrett's ship, was one of the several names which came into general use for Niulakita during the 19th century. The United States Exploring Expedition under Lieutenant Charles Wilkes visited Funafuti, Nukufetau and Vaitupu in 1841.Tyler, David B. – 1968 The Wilkes Expedition. The First United States Exploring Expedition (1838–42). Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society During the visit of the expedition to Tuvalu Alfred Thomas Agate, engraver and illustrator, recorded the dress and tattoo patterns of men of Nukufetau. On 15 April 1889 Niulakita was sold for $1,000 to Mr H. J. Moors, an American citizen living in Apia, Samoa. Niulakita and other islands of the Tuvaluan archipelago were claimed by the United States under the Guano Islands Act (1856), which was passed by the U.S. Congress to enable citizens of the U.S. to take possession of islands containing guano deposits. In the 1840s guano was a source of saltpeter for gunpowder as well as an agricultural fertilizer. The legislation was enacted to assist in securing supplies of guano. On 4 August 1892 Captain Davis of visited Niulakita but did not land on the island, he recorded in the ship's journal: “Several natives appeared on the beach, and hoisted up an American ensign.” On 16 September 1896 Captain Gibson of HMS Curacoa, recorded in the ship's journal that six men and six women, natives of various islands, were living on Niulakita working for Moors. Captain Gibson determined that the island was not under American protection so he hoisted the Union Jack and delivered the flag, with a copy of the Declaration of British Protectorate, to the headman of the working party. Moors later abandoned Niulakita when the deposits of guano were depleted. In 1900 USFC Albatross visited Funafuti when the United States Fish Commission were investigating the formation of coral reefs on Pacific atolls. Harry Clifford Fassett, captain's clerk and photographer, recorded people, communities and scenes at Funafuti. During the Pacific War (World War 2) Funafuti was used as a base to prepare for the subsequent seaborn attacks on the Gilbert Islands (Kiribati) that were occupied by Japanese forces. The United States Marine Corps landed on Funafuti on 2 October 1942 and on Nanumea and Nukufetau in August 1943. The Japanese had already occupied Tarawa and other islands in what is now Kiribati, but were delayed by the losses at the Battle of the Coral Sea. The atolls of Tuvalu acted as a staging post during the preparation for the Battle of Tarawa and the Battle of Makin that commenced on 20 November 1943, which was the implementation of \\"Operation Galvanic\\". Following Tuvalu becoming an independent nation in 1978, relations with the United States were confirmed by the signing of a Treaty of Friendship in 1979, which was ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1983, under which the United States renounced prior territorial claims to four Tuvaluan islands (Funafuti, Nukufetau, Nukulaelae and Niulakita) under the Guano Islands Act of 1856. Management of tuna fishing in the western Pacific Tuvalu participates in the operations of the Pacific Island Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) and the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC). The Tuvaluan government, the US government, and the governments of other Pacific islands, are parties to the South Pacific Tuna Treaty (SPTT), which entered into force in 1988. Tuvalu is also a member of the Nauru Agreement which addresses the management of tuna purse seine fishing in the tropical western Pacific. In May 2013 representatives from the United States and the Pacific Islands countries agreed to sign interim arrangement documents to extend the Multilateral Fisheries Treaty (which encompasses the South Pacific Tuna Treaty) to confirm access to the fisheries in the Western and Central Pacific for US tuna boats for 18 months. Tuvalu and the other members of the Pacific Island Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) and the United States have settled a tuna fishing deal for 2015; a longer term deal will be negotiated. The treaty is an extension of the Nauru Agreement and provides for US flagged purse seine vessels to fish 8,300 days in the region in return for a payment of US$90 million made up by tuna fishing industry and US-Government contributions. Differences in positions on climate change COP21 in Paris (2015) There have been disagreements between the two countries over the issues of climate change and the Kyoto Protocol. The main point of friction between Tuvalu and the United States has been the latter's non-ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. The impact of global warming in Tuvalu has been a concern of the government of Tuvalu. Following the Kyoto Protocol, Tuvalu repeatedly urged the United States to do more to reduce its pollution levels. In 2002, Tuvaluan Prime Minister Koloa Talake threatened to take the United States to the International Court of Justice for its refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol.\\"Talake, Luka Tussle For PM In Island Nation Polls\\" , Samisoni Pareti, Pacific Magazine, August 1, 2002 He was prevented from doing so by his subsequent defeat in that year's general election. More recently, under the administration of President Barack Obama, the United States has acknowledged the effects of climate change on the Pacific Small Island Developing States (PSIDS). Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga said at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21 in December 2015) that the goal for COP21 should a global temperature goal of below 1.5 degrees Celsius relative to pre- industrial levels, which is the position of the Alliance of Small Island States. The leadership of President Obama in achieving the outcome of COP21, resulted in the participating countries agreeing to reduce their carbon output \\"as soon as possible\\" and to do their best to keep global warming \\"to well below 2 degrees C\\", results in a closer alignment in the climate change policies of the two countries. Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga described the important outcomes of COP21 as including the stand-alone provision for assistance to small island states and some of the least developed countries for loss and damage resulting from climate change and the ambition of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees by the end of the century. Consistent position on human rights practices Prime Minister Apisai Ielemia and Sikinala Ielemia with President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama (2009) Tuvalu supports American positions on issues related to human rights. Tuvalu participates in the preparation of reports prepared by the U.S. Department of State entitled \\"Country Reports on Human Rights Practices\\", which are submitted to the U.S Congress by the Department of State in compliance with the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA) and section 504 of the Trade Act of 1974. Tuvalu is recognised as one of the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and participates in the activities of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and from this perspective Tuvalu lobbies to achieve development goals that in international forums may be opposed by the United States. There are many aspects of social and political policy on which Tuvalu maintains a position that is consistent with that of the United States. On 29 September 2013 the Deputy Prime Minister Vete Sakaio stated in his speech to the General Debate of the 68th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, that Tuvalu, maintains a commitment to “multilateralism and genuine collective action to reflect, assess, address and plan ahead our Chartered principles of peace, justice, human rights and social progress, and equal opportunity for all.” Tuvalu's relations with Cuba Tuvalu recognises the government of Cuba and the government of Tuvalu has, since 2008, stated a desire for the U.S. to review its relationship with Cuba.\\"Cuba-Pacific ministerial meeting underway in Havana\\", ABC Radio Australia, 17 September 2008 The Deputy Prime Minister Vete Sakaio stated in his 2013 speech to the U.N. that “Tuvalu also fully supports the lifting of the embargos against Cuba. This will allow the Republic of Cuba to further consolidate and enhance its cooporation with Small Islands Developing States like Tuvalu.” Diplomatic missions Neither country has a resident ambassador. The United States ambassador to Fiji is accredited to Tuvalu. Tuvalu maintains a diplomatic presence in the United States through its Permanent Mission to the United Nations, in New York City;US Department of State it is headed by Samuelu Laloniu (since 21 July 2017).

He played professionally in Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Austria and the United States, earning two caps, scoring two goals, with the Hungarian national team in 1922. Schwarz founded, owned, managed and played for the New York Americans in the first and second American Soccer Leagues. He was also the ASL and International Soccer League vice president. His daughter was married to United States national team player Ben Zinn. Player Schwarz began his professional career as a forward for Ferencvárosi TC when he was seventeen. In 1922, Ferencvárosi won the Hungarian Cup. That fall, Schwarz moved to Czechoslovakian club Makkabi Brno. In November 1923, Makkabi played an exhibition game against SK Rapid Wien, crushing them 4-1 off two Schwarz goals. This brought him to the attention of Hakoah Vienna which signed him in December 1923. He went on to play twelve games, scoring nine goals, through the remainder of the 1923-1924 season. In the spring of 1926, Hakoah Vienna toured the United States. Impressed by the high pay and relatively minor anti-Semitism compared to Europe, Schwarz and several of his team mates decided to move to the U.S. following the conclusion of the tour. Before he did so, he returned to Austria where Hakoah won the league championship. Then in the summer of 1926, he left Europe for good to move to the United States. When he arrived, he signed with the New York Giants of the American Soccer League (ASL). In 1928, the ASL and United States Football Federation engaged in a struggle for dominance in the U.S. Known as the “Soccer War”, this struggle led to USFA and FIFA declaring the ASL and “outlaw league”. When that happened, Schwarz signed for Rangers F.C., but was unable to join the club due to labor restrictions in Great Britain. After the Rangers deal fell through, Schwarz helped form New York Hakoah in the Eastern Professional Soccer League. Hakoah took third in the league, but ran away with the 1929 National Challenge Cup. Hakoah won both legs of the final over St. Louis Madison Kennel, with Schwarz scoring a goal in Hakoah's 3-0 second game victory. Following the end of the “Soccer War” in 1929, the ASL and ESL merged with New York Hakoah of the ESL merging with Brooklyn Hakoah of the ASL to form the Hakoah All-Stars. In 1931, Schwarz founded his own team, the New York Americans with whom he became both a player and coach. In 1933, Schwarz and his team mates lost to Stix, Baer and Fuller F.C. in the final of the 1933 National Challenge Cup. While the Americans defeated the St. Louis Shamrocks in the 1937 National Challenge Cup, Schwarz did not play in the final game as he had broken his leg in February 1937. After that, he played sporadically, but continued to play occasional games with the Americans until at least 1951.The Year in American Soccer – 1951 =National team= Schwarz earned two caps, scoring two goals, with the Hungarian national team. Both games came in July 1922, the first against Germany and the second a few days later against Finland. In that game, Schwarz scored two goals in a 5-1 victory. He never played for the national team again. On 19 May 1935, Schwarz played an unofficial international match for the United States men's national soccer team in a 5-1 loss to Scotland. Coach =Professional= When Schwarz founded the New York Americans in 1931, he installed himself as team coach. At some point, he left coaching, but in 1956 returned as coach of the Americans =National team= In 1953, Schwarz was selected to coach the United States men's national soccer team from 1953 until 1955. During that time, he compiled a 2-4 record as the U.S. failed to qualify for the 1958 FIFA World Cup. Owner In 1931, Schwarz founded the New York Americans, for which he was both the owner and player-manager. He guided the team through the last years of the ASL's existence, going to the final of the 1933 National Challenge Cup. That spring, the ASL collapsed and Schwarz was instrumental in the creation of a second American Soccer League which began playing in the fall of 1933. He continued to own the Americans for an unknown time after that. Executive Following the collapse of the first American Soccer League in the spring of 1933, Schwarz became instrumental in the founding of the second league with that name. In the fall of 1933, the new league came into existence with Schwarz entering the Americans in the Metropolitan Division. Schwarz was indefatigable, selling tickets, promoting the team and even selling concessions at halftimes. Over the years, Schwarz was one of the more important executives in the American Soccer League, In 1947, he became the league's vice president and in 1957, he served as the ASL Business Manager. In 1960, he became the vice president and general manager of the International Soccer League. Promoter Schwarz also worked during World War II to convince American GIs living in Britain to play soccer, in hopes of growing the sport in America. He later organized tours by top European clubs in order to increase the popularity of the sport. He was also not set on the outdoor game, but in 1960, he also organized one of the first major indoor soccer tournaments at Madison Square Garden. Schwarz was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 1951. He died on 19 June 1977 in Queens.

Relations with successor governments were cordial, although Milton Obote and his administration rejected strong U.S. criticism of Uganda's human rights situation. Bilateral relations between the United States and Uganda have been good since Museveni assumed power, and the United States has welcomed his efforts to end human rights abuses and to pursue economic reform. Uganda is a strong supporter of the Global War on Terror. The United States is helping Uganda achieve export-led economic growth through the African Growth and Opportunity Act and provides a significant amount of development assistance. At the same time, the United States is concerned about continuing human rights problems and the pace of progress toward the establishment of genuine political pluralism.

Most U.S. program assistance is focused in the areas of health, education, and agriculture. Both the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have major programs to fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Other programs promote trade and investment, curb environmental degradation, encourage the peaceful resolution of local and international conflicts, and promote honest and open government. The United States also provides large amounts of humanitarian assistance to populations without access to adequate food supplies because of conflict, drought and other factors.

The United States upgraded its consulate in the capital, Kyiv, to embassy status on January 21, 1992.

Following a period of economic decline characterized by high inflation and a continued reliance on state controls, the Ukrainian government began taking steps in the fall of 1999 to reinvigorate economic reform that had been stalled for years due to a lack of a reform majority in the Ukrainian parliament. The Ukrainian government's stated determination to implement comprehensive economic reform is a welcome development in the eyes of the US government, and the U.S. is committed to supporting Ukraine in continuing on this path. Bilateral relations suffered a setback in September 2002 when the federal government of the U.S. announced it had authenticated a recording of President Leonid Kuchma's July 2000 decision to transfer a Kolchuga early warning system to Iraq. The Government of Ukraine denied that the transfer had occurred. Ukraine's democratic Orange Revolution has led to closer cooperation and more open dialogue between Ukraine and the United States. U.S. policy remains centered on realizing and strengthening a democratic, prosperous, and secure Ukraine more closely integrated into Europe and Euro-Atlantic structures. Secretary of State John Kerry and Vice President Joe Biden with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko on January 20, 2016 A cornerstone for the continuing partnership of the US with Ukraine and the other post-Soviet states has been the Freedom for Russia and Emerging Eurasian Democracies and Open Markets (FREEDOM) Support Act (FSA), enacted in October 1992. Ukraine has been a primary recipient of FSA assistance. Total U.S. assistance since independence has been more than $3 billion. U.S. assistance to Ukraine is targeted to promote political and economic reform and to address urgent humanitarian needs. The U.S. has consistently encouraged Ukraine's transition to a democratic society with a prosperous market-based economy. In November 2006, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) selected Ukraine to be eligible to apply for compact assistance. Ukraine already participates in the MCC Threshold Program, and in December 2006 signed a $45 million Threshold Program agreement. This program, which began implementation in early 2007, aims to reduce corruption in the public sector through civil society monitoring and advocacy, judicial reform, increased government monitoring and enforcement of ethical and administrative standards, streamlining and enforcing regulations, and combating corruption in higher education. Ukraine is beginning the process of developing a Compact proposal, and successful implementation of the Threshold Program will be necessary before the MCC will enter into a Compact with Ukraine.

The letter will also be sent to the Chairman of the UN General Assembly. The letter was passed in a 77 to 9 roll- call vote with one abstention.Crimean parliament votes against opening U.S. diplomatic post, Interfax-Ukraine (18 February 2009) In 2012 the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations passed Resolution 466, calling for the unconditional release of political prisoner Yulia Tymoshenko and implemented a visa ban against those responsible. The resolution condemned the administration of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych (in office: 2010-2014) and asked NATO to suspend all cooperative agreements with Ukraine. In response, First Deputy General Prosecutor of Ukraine Renat Kuzmin wrote a letter to U.S. President Barack Obama, complaining that his visa was revoked. Since 2016 certain conspiracy-theories have complicated relations between Ukraine and the United States. On June 8, 2017 an explosive device was hurled at the United States embassy in Kyiv. In 2015, Rep. John Conyers and his colleague Ted Yoho offered bipartisan amendments to block the U.S. military training of Ukraine's Azov Battalion. Some members of the battalion are openly white supremacists.\\"Ukraine's Neo-Nazis Won't Get U.S. Money\\". Bloomberg. 12 June 2015. On December 22, 2017 the United States agreed to supply Ukraine with more lethal weapons, including Javelin anti-tank missiles, though with the stipulation they could not be used against the Russian-backed insurgency. In 2018 the U.S. House of Representatives passed a provision blocking any training of Azov Battalion of the Ukrainian National Guard by American forces, citing its neo-Nazi background. In previous years, between 2014 and 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives passed amendments banning support of Azov, but due to pressure from the Pentagon, the amendments were quietly lifted. On April 25, 2018, 57 members of the House of Representatives, led by Ro Khanna, released a condemnation of Holocaust distortion in Ukraine. They criticized Ukraine's 2015 memory laws glorifying Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) and its leaders, such as Roman Shukhevych. The condemnation came in an open bipartisan letter to Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan. On September 24, 2019 the United States House of Representatives initiated an impeachment inquiry against incumbent U.S. president Donald Trump in the wake of a scandal surrounding a phone conversation that Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25. On August 12, 2019 an anonymous whistleblower had submitted a complaint to U.S. Inspector General Michael Atkinson that stated that Trump had allegedly attempted to pressure Zelensky into launching an investigation on former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, during the phone call. Trump held a meeting with Zelensky in New York City on September 25 where both presidents stated that Zelensky had not been pressured during the July phone call and that nothing out of the ordinary had occurred.

The United Arab Emirates has been described as the United State's best counter-terrorism ally in the Gulf by Richard A. Clarke, the US national security advisor and counter-terrorism expert. In terms of defense, the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces has been nicknamed \\"Little Sparta\\" by United States Armed Forces Generals and US secretary of defense James Mattis for its active role against extremists in the Middle East. The United Arab Emirates also hosts the only United States border preclearance in the Middle East. Diplomatic Relations Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington DC, May 2017 US embassy in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The United States was the third country to establish formal diplomatic relations with the UAE and has had an ambassador resident in the UAE since 1974. The two countries have enjoyed friendly relations with each other and have developed strong government-to-government ties including a close security cooperation. The quality of U.S.-UAE relations increased dramatically as a result of the U.S.-led coalition's campaign to end the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. UAE ports host more U.S. Navy ships than any port outside the U.S. The United Arab Emirates influenced the US elections in 2016, where the Emirati government funneled over $3.5 million through a channel that ran from an adviser of Mohammed bin Zayed, George Nader, to a California businessman, Ahmad “Andy” Khawaja. In an indictment unsealed by the US Department of Justice in December 2019, the two businessmen, along with six others, were charged them with conspiring to make and conceal excessive campaign contributions to gain influence in US, first through Hillary Clinton and then through Donald Trump. On September 3, Khawaja was arrested by the authorities in Lithuania, 10 months after the DOJ’s indictment. Lithuania police said that he “performed multimillion-dollar transactions and was in possession of significant amounts of money”, when arrested. According to former US ambassador to the UAE Richard G. Olson, “It was well known that if you needed something done in the Middle East, the Emiratis would do it.” Leading the UAE Embassy in Washington, DC is Ambassador Yousef Al Otaiba, who presented his credentials in July 2008. In December 2018, the UAE reopened its embassy in Damascus to restore ties with the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad – a step that the UAE took against the wishes of the US. In January 2019, the UAE hosted a Syrian trade delegation that was led by a businessman, who was on US Treasury sanctions list since 2011. US prosecutors in 2016 alleged that Dubai-based Gunes General Trading carried out suspicious transactions totaling to $142 million, using the UAE financial system during 2011 and 2012, the BBC found and reported on 20 September 2020. US prosecutors accused the Dubai-based trading firm of being part of a network that was under the control of Turkish-Iranian gold trader, Reza Zarrab. The network allegedly coordinated the transaction worth millions of dollars for the Iranian government and other US-sanctioned entities belonging to Iran. On 19 August 2020, the Trump administration slapped sanctions on two aviation companies in the United Arab Emirates over their work for Iranian airline, Mahan Air. The airline has been subject to US counter terrorism sanctions since 2019 for its support to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the State Department has designated as a foreign terrorist organization. The sanctions targeted UAE-based Parthia Cargo and Delta Parts Supply, along with Parthia’s owner, Amin Mahdavi. Bilateral Nuclear Cooperation Agreement On January 15, 2009, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Foreign Minister of the United Arab Emirates, and U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice signed a bilateral agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation that enhances international standards of nuclear non- proliferation. President Barack Obama subsequently endorsed the agreement and submitted it to Congress on May 20, 2009 for the mandatory 90-day review.White House: Office of the Press Secretary Press Release After a hearing on Capitol Hill in July 2009, leaders of the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations Committees issued resolutions supporting the US-UAE nuclear cooperation agreement.\\"House Committee on Foreign Affairs, July 14, 2009 Military U.S. Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security Ellen Tauscher and United Arab Emirates Ambassador Yousef Al Otaiba exchange diplomatic notes to bring the Agreement for Peaceful Civilian Nuclear Energy Cooperation into force. (17 December 2009) The United States maintains three military bases in the United Arab Emirates. The three bases are Al Dhafra Air Base, Al Minhad Air Base, and the Fujairah Naval Base. A major military hospital modeled on the major American medical facility in Germany, Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, is also being built in the UAE which will be operated by the United States Army, United States Department of Defense, and the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces. According to Richard A. Clarke, then US National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection and Counter-terrorism and a contributor in the 9/11 Commission Report, the UAE is the United States best counter-terrorism ally in the Gulf. According to previous US ambassador to UAE Richard G. Olson, Deputy Commander of the UAE Armed Forces Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan structured the UAE Armed forces to be closely aligned with the US military. The United Arab Emirates Armed Forces is the only Arab country to commit military troops for humanitarian aid missions in the US-led War in Afghanistan. The UAE military is nicknamed as \\"Little Sparta\\" by United States Armed Forces Generals and specifically by former US defense secretary James Mattis due to its active and effective military role, particularly in the War on Terrorism, despite its small active personnel. Mattis has also called the UAE led 2016 Battle of Mukalla operation a model for American troops, referencing how the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces liberated the port of Mukalla from Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula forces in 36 hours after being held by AQAP for more than a year. Prior to joining the Trump administration, Mattis received permission from the US military after retiring from the Marine Corps to work as a military adviser to the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces. The United Arab Armed Forces also receive defense advice from two former top US military commanders, former Secretary of Defense James Mattis and General John R. Allen, a retired United States Marine Corps four-star general and former commander of the NATO International Security Assistance Force. Through a partnership with the United States, the United Arab Emirates has spearheaded an active role against fighting AQAP and ISIL-YP in Yemen. On 26 February 2019, US president Donald Trump publicly thanked the United Arab Emirates on his Twitter for the UAE's effort in rescuing Danny Burch, a US citizen who was held in captivity for 18 months by militants in Yemen. United States border pre-clearance Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, 2013 The United Arab Emirates is one of the few countries and the only one in the Middle East which has a US border pre-clearance that are staffed and operated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers, allowing travelers from Abu Dhabi International Airport to reach the United States as domestic US travelers. The U.S. customs pre-clearance facility at Abu Dhabi International Airport officially opened on January 26, 2014. U.S. customs pre-clearance is currently being planned at Dubai International Airport. Intelligence According to Reuters, US intelligence operatives from the National Security Agency (NSA) helped the United Arab Emirates National Electronic Security Authority (NESA) engage in surveillance of terrorists, other governments, militants, human rights activists, and dissidents in a collaborative project called Project Raven. The project helped break up an ISIS network within the Emirates as well as assess if other attacks were imminent after the ISIS inspired Murder of Ibolya Ryan in Abu Dhabi. According to Lori Stroud, one of the former NSA intelligence analysts, Americans were also targeted for surveillance.Inside the UAE’s secret hacking team of American mercenaries, Reuters, 30 Jan 2019 The New York Times reported that as a result, Mozilla rejected Abu Dhabi-based cybersecurity firm DarkMatter – linked to Project Raven – from administering online website security certificates. The United States Central Intelligence Agency does not gather human intelligence about the UAE as it does on almost every other nation where the United States has significant interests.

The organisation and motivation of the uprisings were unclear, since many different organizations of Vietnamese revolutionaries with different ideologies were involved. Some were supporters of the mystic and geomancer Phan Xich Long, who had claimed to be a descendant of the boy Emperor Hàm Nghi, who had been deposed by the French for attempting a revolt with the aim of securing independence some three decades earlier. Long had been imprisoned three years earlier after declaring himself Emperor and attempting to storm Saigon with the help some purported magic potion to restore the monarchy. Long's supporters sought his release from jail. There were also a loose alliance of secret organizations from the provinces in the Mekong Delta region. The centre of the planning appeared to be the Nui Cam Pagoda in Châu Đốc, while many participants also appeared to have been sympathisers and affiliates of Prince Cường Để, who was living in exile. Cường Để was a direct descendant of Emperor Gia Long, who founded the Nguyễn Dynasty in 1802. Cường Để was a descendant of Gia Long's eldest son Prince Cảnh, but Canh died of smallpox before his father, so the succession passed to Emperor Minh Mạng and his descendants.Marr, p. 102. A later report from the Governor General of French Indochina to the French Minister of Colonies asserted that Cường Để was the \\"chef occulte\\" of the rising, through the actions of his \\"most loyal partisans and most active agents in Cochinchina\\". The centrepiece of the plot was to seize the central prison of Saigon, in order to facilitate the release of Phan Xich Long and many other revolutionaries who had been imprisoned. This would also have provided access to the French armoury and their firearms, which would have given an upgrade to the firepower of the Vietnamese, who were armed with spears and machetes. The prison was also viewed among the populace as a symbol of the hated French colonial rule, so its capture was intended to provide a psychological boost to foment the general public into joining the uprising. On February 14, 1916, around three hundred men landed at Saigon's waterfront and began to move in groups towards the penitentiary, shouting slogans as they marched. However, some of the groups came across police patrols, and retreated back towards the piers after being fired upon with pistols.Marr, p. 230. The groups that did reach the prison found the gates securely protected, and retreated chaotically. Despite the failure to capture the jail, many areas in the Mekong Delta proceeded with their planned actions against the French. Phan Xich Long At Bien Hoa, on the northern outskirts of Saigon, a revolt was attempted at the local jail. In Thủ Dầu Một, another town northwest of Saigon, a march towards Saigon was planned, but was quickly dispersed by the authorities. At Bến Tre to the south in the Mekong Delta, a march by villagers resulted in the burning and destruction of the local archives and registers offices. After French authorities broke up the march, the participants retreated and began to attack any Vietnamese collaborators that they could lay their hands on. At Vũng Tàu, a port town to the southeast of Saigon, an armed group made a failed attempt to seize the military post. In Vĩnh Long in the delta, the Nghia Hoa society led a protest march to the office of the local French administrator, while a group that had come north from Cần Thơ with the intention of joining them was forcibly dispersed before reaching their destination. A bomb was uncovered in Mỹ Tho, while the town of Long Xuyên in the far south saw ransackings and kidnappings for ransom. In the town of Tây Ninh, on the western border with Cambodia, an armed rebel unit led by the self-proclaimed General Vuong Van Le briefly patrolled the surrounding areas. The French community in Cochinchina was taken aback by the revolt that had occurred and demanded a strong response from the colonial authorities. Hundreds of Vietnamese were quickly apprehended, and summary justice was dispensed by a French War Council. Eventually, 51 people were put to death and an unknown number of dissidents were jailed. Despite some criticism back in France about the severity of the reaction, the local authorities prevailed in implementing their strong response.Marr, p. 231.

The house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1971. and Description and history The Heyward House is located in the Charleston Historic District, on the east side of Church Street south of Trade Street. It is a two-story structure, with a tile roof and stuccoed exterior. It is now attached as a wing to the house immediately to its left, a three-story building. The house is not architecturally distinguished, and has principally been modified since the period of Heyward's residence by the removal of intervening walls with the adjacent house to create enlarged dining and bedrooms. Dubose Heyward was born in 1885 into an aristocratic Charleston family, which fell upon hard times, leading him to engage in a number of low-wage jobs early in life. He was a significant early figure in the renaissance of Southern literature in the 1910s, helping found the Poetry Society of South Carolina in 1920. In 1925 he moved to North Carolina, where he wrote Porgy, his most significant claim to fame. It was unique at the time in present a southern African-American in a well-rounded and human light, and not as either a comic foil or propaganda piece. Porgy was the inspiration for George Gershwin's popular folk opera Porgy and Bess, cementing the character's place in American culture. Heyward lived in this house between about 1919 and 1924.

It is now owned and operated by the Charleston Museum. Furnished for the late 18th century, the house includes a collection of Charleston-made furniture. Other structures include the carriage shed and 1740s kitchen building. The house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1970. and History Built in 1772, this Georgian-style double house was the town home of Thomas Heyward, Jr., one of four South Carolina signers of the Declaration of Independence. A patriot leader and artillery officer with the South Carolina militia during the American Revolutionary War, Heyward was captured when the British took Charleston in 1780. He was exiled to St. Augustine, Florida, but was exchanged in 1781. The City rented this house for George Washington's use during the President's week-long Charleston stay, in May 1791, and it has traditionally been called the \\"Heyward-Washington House.\\" Heyward sold the house in 1794 to John F. Grimké, also a Revolutionary War officer and father of Sarah and Angeline Grimke, the famous abolitionists and suffragettes. It was acquired by the museum in 1929, opened the following year as Charleston's first historic house museum, and was recognized as a National Historic Landmark in 1978. The museum features a collection of historic Charleston-made furniture including the priceless Holmes Bookcase, considered one of the finest examples of American-made colonial furniture. The property also features the only 1740s kitchen building open to the public in Charleston as well as formal gardens featuring plants commonly used in the South Carolina Lowcountry in the late 18th century.

The IUPAC name is poly(1-carboxyethylene). They may be homopolymers of acrylic acid, or crosslinked with an allyl ether of pentaerythritol, allyl ether of sucrose, or allyl ether of propylene. In a water solution at neutral pH, PAA is an anionic polymer, i.e. many of the side chains of PAA will lose their protons and acquire a negative charge. This makes PAAs polyelectrolytes, with the ability to absorb and retain water and swell to many times their original volume. Dry PAAs are sold as white, fluffy powders that are frequently used as gels in cosmetic and personal care products. Their role in cosmetics is to suspend solid in liquids, prevent emulsions from separating and control the consistency in flow of cosmetics. Carbomer codes (910, 934, 940, 941, and 934P) are an indication of molecular weight and the specific components of the polymer. For many applications PAAs are used in form of alkali metal or ammonium salts, e.g. sodium polyacrylate. In the dry powder form, the positively charged sodium ions are bound to the polyacrylate, however in aqueous solutions the sodium ions can dissociate. Instead of an organized polymer chain, this leads to a swollen gel that can absorb a high amount of water. Polyacrylic acid is a weak anionic polyelectrolyte, whose degree of ionisation is dependent on solution pH. In its non-ionised form at low pHs, PAA may associate with various non-ionic polymers (such as polyethylene oxide, poly-N-vinyl pyrrolidone, polyacrylamide, and some cellulose ethers) and form hydrogen-bonded interpolymer complexesVitaliy V Khutoryanskiy, Georgios Staikos (2009) https://books.google.com/books?id=6vOLVWUSebYC&pg;=PR5 In aqueous solutions PAA can also form polycomplexes with oppositely charged polymers (for example, chitosan), surfactants, and drug molecules (for example, streptomycin). Applications Polyacrylic acid and its derivatives are used in disposable diapers, ion exchange resins, adhesives and detergents. Detergents are often copolymers of acrylic acid that can be used in both zeolites and phosphates in washing powder formulations. They are also popular as thickening, dispersing, suspending, and emulsifying agents in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and paints. Cross-linked polyacrylic acid has also been used in the processing of household products, including floor cleaners. Acrylic acid is also the main component of Superadsorbent Polymers (SAPs), cross-linked polyacrylates that can absorb and retain more than 100 times of their own weight in liquid. PAA may inactivate the antiseptic chlorhexidine gluconate. The neutralized polyacrylic acid gels are suitable to obtain biocompatible matrices for medical applications such as gels for skin care or skin disease treatment products. PAA films can be deposited on orthopaedic implants to protect them from corrosion. Crosslinked hydrogels of AA and gelatin have also been used as medical glue, which has a high bonding strength. For the development of polymeric matrices which allows controlled delivery rate of active substances, the recent investigations aimed towards the clarification of the conformational changes of the polymeric gel during neutralization, light irradiation, and embedment of gold nanoparticles. The US Food and Drug Administration authorised the use of SAPs in packaging with indirect food contact. Polymer synthesis Free radical polymerization is still the most common industrial for production of polymers. For the free radical polymerization of acrylic acid, most commonly thermochemical initiators such as potassium persulfate and AIBN are used. The polymerization can take several hours to complete but can be accelerated by drastically increasing the temperature and pressure. PAA is widely used in dispersants and since the molecular weight has a significant impact on the rheological properties and dispersion capacity, it is crucial to have control over the molecular weight distribution. RAFT polymerization was used to obtain PAA with a defined molecular weight, leading to improved dispersion properties. This was only possible in low AA/CTA ratios, at higher ratios transfer to the solvent was observed that had a negative effect on control over the reaction. Block copolymers of PAA have been prepared that are responsive to pH and temperature stimuli, demonstrating the possibility to be used for drug delivery purposes. ATRP has been used to growth PAA brushes from the surface. One reported approach was with surface-initiated ATRP of tert-butyl acrylate that was subsequently deprotected through pyrolysis to form the carboxylic acid. These PAA brushes can form chelate complex with silver and can therefore exhibit antibacterial activity.

He was born in Visalia, California, of Indigenous Mexican ancestry, to Martin and Dora (Garcia) Perez. Martin Sr. was born in Aguascaliente, Mexico. Dora's father, identified in records as Mission Indian, attended Sherman Indian School in Riverside, California. Dora's mother was a Yaqui curandera, or traditional healer, from Altar, Sonora, Mexico. The family had close ties to the family of Mike Garcia, the pitcher for the Cleveland Indians, and both referred to each other as cousins. Minor League career Perez played football, basketball and baseball for Redwood High School, signed with the California Angels as an amateur free agent after graduation, and served in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. He was an infielder in the minor leagues from 1964-69 (Idaho Falls, Quad Cities, San Jose, El Paso, Hawaii). He led Texas League shortstops in assists with 363 and in double plays with 72 at El Paso in 1968. He led Pacific Coast League shortstops in double plays with 79 in 1969, and played on the Hawaii team that won the PCL Southern Division Championship in 1970. Major League career Perez was called up to the majors as relief shortstop for Jim Fregosi in September 1969, and in October 1970 was traded to Atlanta.\\"Society for American Baseball Research\\" Perez, 5 feet 10 inches and 160 pounds, was the Braves' starting shortstop from 1971–73 and their starting second baseman the following two seasons. In 1971, he helped the club break the all-time Braves' record for double plays in a season with 180. In 1976, he was the Giants' most-used second baseman, appearing in 89 games there after his June 13 acquisition in a trade that included future Giants' slugger Darrell Evans. He led National League second basemen in fielding percentage in 1974. Perez was acquired in March 1977 by the defending AL champion New York Yankees to shore up their middle-infield and possibly compete for the starting shortstop position. Soon after, however, the Yankees traded for Bucky Dent to play shortstop and Perez finished his career at Oakland in 1977-78. In 10 seasons, he played in 931 games and had 3,131 at bats, 313 runs, 771 hits, 180 doubles, 22 triples, 22 home runs, 241 RBI, 11 stolen bases and 245 walks. His career batting average was .246.

H. Gordon (AP-117) was a troop transport that served with the United States Navy in World War II. After the war, she was transferred to the US Army and served as USAT General W. H. Gordon. With the outbreak of the Korean War, she was reacquired by the Navy as a civilian-manned Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) vessel, and redesignated USNS General W. H. Gordon (T-AP-117). She served again under the same designation in the Vietnam War. General W. H. Gordon was launched under Maritime Commission contract by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company of Kearny, New Jersey, 7 May 1944; and commissioned, after being acquired by the Navy, 29 June 1944, Captain R. E. Wood, USCG, in command. World War II Following her shakedown cruise in Chesapeake Bay, General W. H. Gordon proceeded to Boston and sailed 5 September in convoy for France. She arrived Cherbourg with troop reinforcements 15 September and returned to New York via Plymouth 30 September 1944. Subsequently, the transport made 12 voyages to various European and African ports in support of the accelerating Allied effort against the Axis. She carried supplies, troops, and took large numbers of German prisoners of war to the United States. General W. H. Gordon sailed to Panama from France 5 August 1945, bringing replacement troops for the Pacific campaigns. She stopped at Ulithi and Manila to debark troops and steamed into San Francisco Bay 25 September 1945. =After hostilities= The war over, the veteran transport sailed again 13 October with over 4,000 occupation troops for Japan and Korea. After one more voyage to Japan, the ship returned to San Francisco 29 January 1946 and decommissioned at Oakland 11 March. She was then stricken from the Naval Vessel Register, and transferred to the War Shipping Administration (WSA). Subsequently she was put to use by the Army Transport Service, as USAT General W. H. Gordon. Army transport General W. H. Gordon was one of two ships of her class chartered by WSA to the American President Lines (APL) in mid-1946 for postwar operation as troopships, the other being . A design designated P2-S2-R10 was prepared, probably for the full conversion of these two ships to passenger liners, but the project was not carried out. While in civilian service the ship appears to have been painted in APL colors but retained the name General W. H. Gordon. She made numerous calls at Shanghai, China. In September 1949 the ship also evacuated 1220 people of 34 different nationalitiesFrank Diköter, The Tragedy of Liberation, 2013 when the Communists took over the city in 1949. In March 1950, at Tientsin, China, she embarked hundreds of foreigners again as well as the U.S. Consul General from Shanghai, who a few days earlier had hauled down his flag, the last flying over a diplomatic post on the Chinese mainland. Korean War In November 1951, upon expiration of APL's charter, she was taken into the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS), reinstated on the Naval Vessel Register and placed in service as a civilian-manned Navy transport. USNS General W. H. Gordon (T-AP-117) departed San Francisco in December 1951 on the first of many trans-Pacific voyages in support of Korean War operations. 1950s-1960s She was modernized at Portland, Oregon, between June and December 1953, with her World War II vintage lifeboats and davits being replaced and eight new empty positions for /50 twin gun mounts fitted, presumably for service as a regular Navy armed transport if required. However, the need for large troop transports declined, and General W. H. Gordon was inactive between October 1954 and March 1955. Transferred to the Atlantic in late 1956, she was laid up in the Maritime Administration's Hudson River reserve fleet in June 1957 and a year later stricken from the Naval Vessel Register. In May 1961 the Navy reacquired General W. H. Gordon from the Maritime Administration, reinstated her on the Naval Vessel Register and returned her to MSTS service. She spent the next several years carrying troops between New York and Bremerhaven, West Germany. In March to April 1963, General W. H. Gordon made a one time voyage under contract to the UN. She sailed from New York, bound for Dar es Salaam, Tanganyika (now part of Tanzania). There, she embarked Indian troops to transport them back to their home country. The voyage to Bombay took six days. Vietnam War In 1965 the transport went to the Pacific to support the expanding Vietnam War, making numerous voyages between the U.S. West Coast and Southeast Asia. The first shipment of troops from the United States occurred on or about June 25, 1965 from the Oakland Army Terminal docks. Elements of the 1st Infantry Division (16th, 18th and 28th infantry battalions) arrived in Oakland by air or on a train from Fort Riley, Kansas. The 1st Battalion, 18th Infantry Regiment arrived at Cam Ranh Bay on July 12 1965. Other elements of the 1st Infantry Division continued on to Vũng Tàu and disembarked on July 15, 1965. On 21 July 1966 she departed from Tacoma Washington with elements of the 4th Infantry Division from Fort Lewis, Washington arriving at Qui Nhon Harbor on 6 August 1966. There were 800 Marines on board. Following disembarkation, the unit was transported to a base camp at the foot of Dragon Mountain near Pleiku, later renamed Camp Enari. She was also credited with participating in the Vietnamese Counteroffensive and the Tet Counteroffensive between December 1967 and March 1968. In September 1967 she transported troops from the 198th Infantry Brigade from Oakland to Da Nang harbor, arriving after a stop at Subic Bay in the Philippines in October 1967. Final decommission General W. H. Gordon was laid up in the Maritime Administration's National Defense Reserve Fleet on the James River, Virginia in April 1970, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register in March 1986 and sold for scrapping in April 1987.

Her car breaks up near Siena where she meets Prince Piero di Montalcino (Gassman), a handsome Italian nobleman. He believes that she must be rich, and she also thinks that he must be wealthy, but that's very far from the truth. The romance reaches its climax at the traditional Palio horse race where, after Diana breaks up with the prince upon hearing that he bribed the jockey of the rival contrada into throwing the race so that his horse could win, she fast-talks the rival horse's owner into letting her ride.

En route to his degrees in science, theology and philosophy of religion, he also studied at Union College, and in Oxford and Chicago. Ordained in 1962, he served two United Church parishes in Quebec and Ontario. At an unusually early stage in his career, David was named to that role of \\"teacher of the church\\" which he never relinquished, holding posts at St.Paul's College, Waterloo, Coughlan College, St. John's, Newfoundland, and from 1978 at Vancouver School of Theology. These were the institutions that served as his base; the world of religious thought and life was his parish. David was no \\"ivory-tower\\" academic. He thought with and for the Church. To peruse his publications is to identify issues that were central in Canadian Christian life during the more than thirty years of his professional ministry. In the \`70's he wrote two small and highly influential books: The Liberation of the Bible. called us to free Scripture from the spiritual strait-jackets into which we had placed it; while The Lordship of Jesus challenged liberal Canadian churches to wrestle seriously with the meaning of their Christology. David wore his Reformed heritage proudly; yet, his was never a parochial identity. By the mid-80s, partnering with the American theologian John Cobb, he was at the forefront of Buddhist-Christian encounter. Out of this experience came his important 1988 work, The Dialogical Imperative. When the First Nation peoples of the north-west coast invited VST to partner with them in finding an innovative way to prepare leadership for Christian ministry in their communities, David gave energetic and imaginative support on the team which created VST's Native Ministries Degree Programme. David also thought ahead of the Church. Most of us were probably bemused when David first began to explore the new world of cybernetics. His revolutionary thinking about Theology in a Digital World, and the new possibilities of human community that would emerge with the World-Wide Web finally received overdue international recognition in 1998, when he was made the recipient of a prestigious Lilly Foundation Grant, as a Faculty Fellow. Tragically, the work this award was to sponsor was cut dramatically short just a year later, when David suffered a cerebral hemorrhage, and died three days short of his 63rd birthday. Lochhead taught at the Vancouver School of Theology since 1978.

Honda marketed the vehicle as a heavy-duty recreation bike with a large load capacity. The Motra has a distinctively rugged appearance, with angular steel tube and panel framework supporting large racks fore and aft. The utility/military style is emphasized by a lack of decorative chrome, and a solid yellow or green paint scheme for all bodywork and wheels. The Motra's 3-speed gearbox is coupled with a second stage to provide the same 3-speeds with a lower final ratio for low-speed off-road travel in steep terrain. The Motra's CT50 designation is a slight exception in Honda nomenclature in that 'CT' does not indicate a mechanical family of bikes. It is distinct from the CT70, which is an ST-series bike for the US and Canadian market, and from the CT50/CT90/CT110 Trail Cubs, which are an offshoot of the Super Cub bikes. The Motra's CT50 designation is a re-use of the Trail Cub CT50 designation from 1968. In 2004 Honda resurrected the Motra's style, but not off-road utility, with the PS250 Big Ruckus scooter.

He was the Vice- Chancellor of University of Pune during 1961 - 1964. The Government of India had honored Potdar with the title Mahamahopadhyaya in 1946, and Padmabhushan in 1967. Because of his vast knowledge, he was sometimes called as Dr. Johnson of Maharashtra or a living encyclopedia. Potdar was a disciple of Itihasacharya Rajwade, and a trustee of Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal (इतिहास संशोधक मंडळ) in Pune. His disciples included Pandurang Sadashiv Sane, Swami Swaroopanand, Vasudeo Sitaram Bendrey, Sethu Madhav Rao Pagadi, and Ramchandra Chintaman Dhere. Early life Potdar was born into Karhade Brahmin Potdar family in the village of Birwadi in Raigad District of Maharashtra. Potdar completed his matriculation in 1906 from Nutan Marathi Vidyalaya in Pune, and four years later received a bachelor's degree in History and Marathi from Fergusson College (University of Bombay in those days), also in Pune. During 1912–1920, he taught at, and later served as the Head Master of Nutan Marathi Vidyalaya. During 1921–1935, he served as a professor at New Poona College (later renamed S. P. College) in Pune. Potdar had mastered Sanskrit to the extent that he could fluently converse in it. He also was proficient in Persian and this proved to be valuable while conducting Historical Research. Personal He never got married and preferred to remain a bachelor. Scholarly career In 1910, Sardar Mehendale, V. K. Rajwade, and Potdar founded Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal. Since then, Potdar maintained passionate interest through his life in the growth of the Mandal. He traveled all over India, collecting historical documents pertaining especially to Maratha empire and Marathi literature. He ran periodicals, delivered speeches, and organized lecture series, inspiring others to research historical papers. He only once went abroad and that was to what in those times was USSR. In 1965, the Government of Maharashtra appointed Potdar to write the biography of Shivaji, but before he could finish the assignment, he died on 6 October 1979 in Pune. There was some criticism in this respect as there were many in Maharashtra in those times who felt that the delay on his part for such an important project was inexcusable.

A Hibernophile is a person who is fond of Irish culture, Irish language and Ireland in general. Its antonym is Hibernophobe. The word originates from \\"Hibernia\\", the word used by the ancient Romans to refer to Ireland. The term is often used in particular for people all over the world (in America especially in areas where many Irish diaspora settled) who ostensibly base their business, political, or social practices on like of or admiration for Irish models. In some cases, Hibernophilia represents an individual's preference of Irish culture to their own, or the belief that Irish culture is superior, or appreciation of Irish history. Hibernophiles often enjoy attending St. Patrick's Day parades that occur all over the world. They also tend to favour stereotypical parts of Irish culture: shamrocks, Leprechauns and shillelaghs. In some cases a Hibernophile may also be called a Plastic Paddy, a pejorative term in Ireland, which refers to a person who appropriates stereotypical aspects of Irish culture without a deeper understanding.

It is the fourth single and final single from the album and was released in Australia in March 2008. The band's publicist, Ms. Fanclub, announced on 27 February that the single would be released to radioplay in the following week, without specifying a date. In her announcement, she also noted that a music video will be released at about the same time. The music video was then released in mid- March; however, the single's release was then announced as 31 March. A music video was released for the song; however, it features the live version of the song taken from the DVD for the Across the Great Divide tour, whereas the radio single for the song is a radio edit of the studio album version. The music video is directly taken from the DVD; however, it is altered optically with filters and converted into black and white. Background \\"Who Really Cares (Featuring the Sound of Insanity)\\" was recorded by Powderfinger for their 2007 album Dream Days at the Hotel Existence at Sunset Sound Studio, Los Angeles, California, in early 2007 with producer Rob Schnapf. The part of the title \\"Featuring the Sound of Insanity\\" refers to a sound just after the bridge in which a sitar is played with synthesised effects overlaid. Prior to its release as a single, a live version of \\"Who Really Cares\\" appeared on the earlier Dream Days at the Hotel Existence single, \\"I Don't Remember\\". Another live version also appears on the group's 2007 DVD Across the Great Divide tour. Release =Cover art= Though the single was never a physical CD release, artwork was created for it. The artwork featured the headless man who is otherwise seen throughout the releases for other singles from Dream Days at the Hotel Existence, however on this cover, the area where his head would be is a fireball, and he appears to be holding a briefcase while walking down the hallway of a hotel, another common theme throughout the artwork for the album. Unlike the last two singles from Dream Days at the Hotel Existence, the artwork doesn't follow the picture-in-picture theme. Powderfinger drummer Jon Coghill (right) and touring pianist Lachlan Doley (left) in the music video for \\"Who Really Cares\\", featuring high contrast optical filters. = Music video = The music video for \\"Who Really Cares\\" is a live performance of the song by Powderfinger for their Across the Great Divide tour in 2007. The music video contains the performance featured on the DVD for the Across the Great Divide tour, filmed in Melbourne in 2007. The performance features a piano solo by the pianist Lachlan Doley, who performed keyboards and piano throughout the tour. The music video, produced by PVC as part of the tour DVD, is completely in black and white and throughout features optical filters that warp and alter the visual display. These filters intensify from the bridge and continue until the end of the clip. The music is performed differently from the original studio recording, with improvised solos, including Ian Haug playing the sitar part on a double necked guitar with synthesised effects to emulate the sitar sound, and the performance of the song ends with a ritardando, where the tempo slows to an end., retrieved 13 March 2008. Critical response Prior to being released as a single, \\"Who Really Cares\\" received a mixed response by reviewers when commenting on Dream Days at the Hotel Existence. Melbourne based webzine TheScene.com.au reviewer Andrew Weaver comments on the song's musical layering, coupling the song with \\"Wishing on the Same Moon\\" and comments that the layering in the two songs gives the music \\"genuine depth of sound and taking the veteran group to new places\\". CitySearch Sydney also made reference to the likeness to \\"Wishing on the Same Moon\\", but notes that what sets the two songs apart is \\"a serviceable fade-out cacophony of keys and guitar\\". Music journalist Chris Leonard of UK magazine Rock Louder praises the live performance of the song while Powderfinger performed in Glasgow on 11 December 2007. J. Watson of Fasterlouder.com.au comments that the song, when performed live at The Sydney Opera House Forecourt for charity on 31 October 2007, was \\"another highlight of the evening\\". Fellow reviewer from Fasterlouder, ShahXerxes, comments on the song's \\"sparse Pink Floyd-esque sound which echoes through \\"Who Really Cares\\", as clever a rock ballad as the band have ever written.\\" Andrew Ramadge of Mess + Noise echoed the comments of similarities to Pink Floyd, and also Neil Young, stating \\"where psych-gospel organ and wailing guitar billow around Fanning’s vocals like a lost track from Dark Side of the Moon\\". Though most of the critical response has been positive, the song has also received criticism from UK reviewer Matthias Scherer of Noize Makes Enemies. Scherer notes that the song's title \\"Who Really Cares\\" is a question that \\"should have been asked before recording, not during\\", though this comment refers both to the song itself, and the whole album of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence. Charts The song's critical response has been mostly positive, though so too were the two prior singles from Dream Days at the Hotel Existence, which both performed poorly in the charts. Like these two, \\"Who Really Cares\\" was released to radioplay and music video stations, but with little inclusion in circulation, leading speculators to believe the single will follow \\"I Don't Remember\\" and \\"Nobody Sees\\" with poor charting performance. This speculation proved to be accurate, leading to \\"Who Really Cares\\" to be the first single by Powderfinger since their 2004 release \\"Bless My Soul\\" to fail to achieve a position on the ARIA Charts. Although B-side \\"One More Kiss As You Fly Away\\" was the number 81 on the ARIA Charts.

Plot  Maurice Giraud (Herbert) is sent to New York to arrange for the Academy Ballet of America to come to Paris to compete for cash prizes at an international dance festival, but a cabbie takes him by mistake to the Club Ballé, a nightclub about to go under. The desperate owners of the club, Terry Moore (Vallee) and Duke Dennis (Jenkins), know that an error has occurred, but see the invitation as a way out of their financial problems. To get some ballet into their nightclub act, they hire ballet teacher Luis Leoni (Fritz Feld) and his star (and only) pupil Kay Morrow (Rosemary Lane) to teach their girls ballet on the boat crossing the Atlantic. Terry finds Kay very attractive, but things are complicated when his ex-wife, Mona (Gloria Dickson), invites herself along, rooming with Kay. Meanwhile, the head of the real ballet company, Padrinsky (Curt Bois), finds out what has happened and cables Giraud aboard ship, then heads to Paris with his patron, a ballet-loving gangster named Mike Coogan (Edward Brophy), who intends to rub out Terry and Duke. Giraud is upset about being hoaxed, but is mollified when a \\"talking dog\\" (a ventriloquist hired by Terry and Duke) convinces him that Padrinsky is the liar. After they arrive in Paris, a representative of the exposition, Pierre Le Brec (Melville Cooper), wants to watch the group's rehearsals, and Duke tells his new friend Coogan, the gangster, that Le Brec is causing him trouble. Coogan goes to \\"take care\\" of the problem, but by mistake knocks out Leoni instead of Le Brec. Padrinsky shows up and arranges for the imposters to be deported on the day of the contest, but Mona manages to change the order so that Coogan and Padrinsky are shipped out, instead, which allows the company to perform and win the grand prize.Arthur Hausner IMDB Plot SummaryTCM Full Synopsis  Cast  * Rudy Vallee as Terry Moore * Rosemary Lane as Kay Morrow * Hugh Herbert as Maurice Giraud * Allen Jenkins as Duke 'Dukie' Dennis * Gloria Dickson as Mona * Melville Cooper as Pierre LeBrec * Mabel Todd as Leticia * Fritz Feld as Luis Leoni * Curt Bois as Padrinsky * Edward Brophy as Mike Coogan * Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson as Doorman * The Schnickelfritz Band as themselves Cast notes: * Carole Landis, Peggy Moran, and Diana Lewis appear as Gold Diggers.  Production  Gold Diggers in Paris was the fifth and last in Warner Bros.' series of \\"Gold Digger\\" films, following Gold Diggers of Broadway (1929), which is now lost; Gold Diggers of 1933, which was a remake of the earlier film, and the first to feature Busby Berkeley's extravagant production numbers; Gold Diggers of 1935; and Gold Diggers of 1937.Warners also released a silent film, The Gold Diggers, in 1923, based on the same play that was used as source material for Gold Diggers of Broadway and Gold Diggers of 1933. Majestic Pictures attempted to cash in on the \\"Gold Diggers\\" concept by naming a feature Gold Diggers of Paris, but Warner Bros. prevented this through legal action, and the filming and release of Gold Diggers in Paris may have been a part of the effort to protect what Warners considered to be their trademark. The film was in production at the Warner Bros. studios in BurbankIMDB Filming Locations from January to March 1938.IMDB Business Data It premiered in New York City on June 1, 1938, and went into general release on June 11.IMDB Release dates The film was known as The Gay Impostors in the U.K.  Songs and music  As usual for a Warner Bros. musical of this period, the extravagant musical numbers were created, designed, staged, choreographed, and directed by Berkeley. The majority of the songs in Gold Diggers in Paris were written by the team of Harry Warren (music) and Al Dubin (lyrics), who contributed many of the songs in the Gold Diggers series and other Warner Bros. musicals. \\"I Wanna Go Back to Bali\\", \\"Latin Quarter\\" (a song which was later used frequently in Warner Bros. cartoons featuring Pepé Le Pew), \\"Let's Drink to a Dream\\", \\"Put That Down in Writing\\", \\"Stranger in Paree\\", and \\"Waltz of the Flowers\\" were their creations in this film. In addition, Harry Warren wrote two other songs, \\"My Adventure\\" and \\"Daydreaming All Night Long\\", but with lyrics by Johnny Mercer.TCM MusicAllmovie Overview Publicity photo of the Schnickelfritz Band = The Schnickelfritz Band = The Schnickelfritz Band, (\\"Schnickelfritz\\" supposedly being German slang for \\"silly fellow\\"), a comedy musical group somewhat reminiscent of Spike Jones (who came later), performs novelty songs in the film. Led by Freddie Fisher, who played woodwinds, sang, and also composed the song \\"Colonel Corn\\" for the band, the band consisted of Stanley Fritts (trombone, drums, jug, washboard), Nels Laakso (cornet, trumpet), Paul Cooper (piano, arrangements), Kenneth Trisko (drums), and Charles Koenig (string bass, tuba). Original trumpeter Nels Laakso left to join The Korn Kobblers and was replaced by trumpet player George Rock, who later became a key member of Spike Jones's City Slickers. The group, which was billed as \\"America's Most Unsophisticated Band!\\", recorded for Decca Records, and was brought to Hollywood by Rudy Vallee after his agent saw the group in St. Paul, Minnesota. According to one source, Gold Diggers in Paris was almost complete at the time the band arrived in Hollywood, so the band's segments were inserted into the film with short intros and reaction shots used to connect them to the rest of the action. The band broke up shortly after doing the film, with Fritts taking some of the members east to become the \\"Korn Kobblers\\", and Fisher staying in Hollywood to open a nightclub, where he appeared billed as \\"The Original Colonel of Corn\\". Although the Schnickelfritz Band never appeared in another film, Fisher appeared in several others as a band leader.\\"Schnickelfritz\\" Time (September 6, 1937)Hoosier Hot Spots Museum\\"Freddie Fisher: The Colonel of Corn and the Schnickelfritz Band\\"IMDB The Schnickelfritz BandIMDB Freddie Fisher  References   External links   * 1938 films 1938 musical films American black-and-white films American films English-language films Films about musical theatre Films directed by Busby Berkeley Films directed by Ray Enright Films produced by Samuel Bischoff Warner Bros. films American musical films ","title":"Gold Diggers in Paris"},{"id":"15998252","text":"Dr.Pappu Venugopala Rao (born 30 June 1948) is a well-known Indian educationist and renowned musicologist.

E. kingii is one of the most common trilobite fossils in the USA locally found in extremely high concentrations within the Wheeler Formation in the U.S. state of Utah. E. kingii has been considered the most recognizable trilobite. Commercial quarries extract E. kingii in prolific numbers, with just one commercial collector estimating 1.5 million specimens extracted in a 20-year career.  Etymology  Even though the generic name Elrathia was first published in the combination E. kingii, a species from the House Range, Utah, the name, itself, is derived from Elrath, Cherokee County, Alabama.  Description  E. kingii is a medium-sized trilobite with a smooth sub-ovate carapace that is tapered towards the rear. Thorax is usually 13 segments. Pygidium has four axial rings and a long terminal piece. Posterior margin of the pygidium has a long broad medial notch. In contrast, E. marjum usually has 12 segments, 5 axial rings, lacks a notched posterior margin and possess incipient antero-lateral spines. The British Columbian species, E. permulta, is much smaller, averaging about only 20 millimeters, and has up to thoracic 14 segments. Because E. permulta lacks several diagnostic features of the genus it may even represent a distinct genus.  Synonyms  Elrathia is variously known as Elrathina, which is a separate genus sometimes considered to be a synonym of Ptychoparella. The species E. kingii is often erroneously called E. kingi (with one i).

The theatre also contains one of only 98 Wurlitzer theatre organs still located in their original installation. Volunteer Work Because of the nature of the Lincoln Theatre, nearly every person who helps with running the theatre does so through volunteering, to keep the maintenance costs as low as possible. Some of the volunteering positions include ticket sales, poster distribution, cleaning, and concessions. Volunteers are often reimbursed for their time in the form of free entry into ticketed events held at the Lincoln. Theatre Organ right The organ at the Lincoln Theatre is a two manual, seven rank style D Special. The addition of \\"Special\\" to the style is from the addition of a full piano (with pedal piano extension) to the right of the console, a marimba to the left, and a kinura rank located in the pipe chamber. The cost of purchasing and installing the organ at the time was $22,500. right Because of the niche area of theatre organ culture, only a few volunteers are in charge of caring for and playing the organ. Some concerts have been held exclusively for the organ; however, it is mostly played for 30 minutes before a movie showing by one of the volunteers. On nights which feature an organist, one of the lobby volunteers places a notice informing guests of who is playing that night.

According to Daoist tradition, Louguan (the eastern terminus of the ancient Silk Road, west of the capital Chang'an) was near where the legendary Laozi 老子 transmitted the Daodejing to the Guardian of the Pass Yin Xi 尹喜. The Xishengjing allegedly records the Daoist principles that Laozi taught Yin Xi before he departed west to India. Yin Xi, from a Ming Dynasty edition Liexian Zhuan The Daozang \\"Daoist Canon\\" contains two Song Dynasty editions (CT 726 and 666), the Xishengjing jizhu 西昇經集注 \\"Collected Commentaries to the Scripture of Western Ascension\\" by Chen Jingyuan 陳景元 (d. 1094 CE, see Huashu), and the Xishengjing by Emperor Huizong 徽宗 (r. 1100-1125 CE). The original date of the Xishengjing is uncertain, and is estimated at \\"late 5th century\\" (Kohn 2007:1114) or \\"6th century\\" (Komjathy 2004:52). The Xishengjing is also known under two variant titles. Laojun xishengjing 老君西昇經 \\"Lord Lao's Scripture of Western Ascension\\" includes the supposed author's honorific name. Xishengji 西升記 \\"Record of Western Ascension\\" uses the usual Chinese character sheng 升 \\"rise; hoist; ascend\\" instead of its variant sheng 昇 (with 日 \\"sun\\" above) and replaces jing \\"classic\\" with ji \\"record; remember; note\\". The Xishengjing is textually affiliated with the Huahujing \\"Classic on Converting the Barbarians\\", which purportedly records Laozi's travels into India where he founded Buddhism. Chinese Buddhists strongly debated this claim that Laozi became Gautama Buddha and argued that both texts were forgeries. The received Xishengjing text has 39 sections in 5 parts, described by Livia Kohn. > First, it establishes the general setting, narrates the background story, > outlines Yin Xi's practice, and discusses some fundamental problems of > talking about the ineffable and transmitting the mysterious. Next, the > inherence of the Dao in the world is described together with an outline of > the way in which the adept can make this inherence practically useful to > himself or herself. A more concrete explanation of the theory and practice, > including meditation instruction, is given in the third part. The fourth > part deals with the results of the practice and with the way of living a > sagely life in the world. The fifth and last part is about \\"returning\\" (fan > 反); it describes the ultimate return of everything to its origin, and > explains the death of the physical body as a recovery of a more subtle form > of participation in the Dao. (2007:1114) For example, the first part of the Xisheng jing begins, > 1\\\\. Western Ascension Laozi ascended to the west to open up the Dao in > India. He was called Master Gu; skilled at entering nonaction, Without > beginning or end, he exists continuously. Thus steadily ascending, he > followed his way and reached the frontier. The guardian of the Pass, Yin Xi, > saw his [sagely] qi. He purified himself and waited upon the guest, who in > turn transmitted Dao and virtue to him. He arranged it in two sections. [He > said]: I'll tell you the essentials of the Dao: Dao is naturalness. Who > practices can attain [it]. Who hears can speak [about it]. Who knows does > not speak; who speaks does not know. Language is formed when sounds are > exchanged. Thus in conversation, words make sense. When one does not know > the Dao, words create confusion. Therefore I don't hear, don't speak; I > don't know why things are. It can be compared to the knowledge of musical > sound. One becomes conscious of it by plucking a string.

On the > other hand, one may be conscious of musical sounds, sad melodies. One then > dampens the sounds to consider them within. Then when the mind makes the > mouth speak, one speaks but does not know. (tr.

It is based on the idea that if motorists are compelled to purchase auto insurance by the government, the government ought to ensure motorists pay fair premiums and receive high-quality coverage. Governments across the country have used various insurance schemes - from full tort to full no-fault - in pursuit of this goal. Public auto insurers in Canada have historically operated on a not-for-profit basis. The exception to this is the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC), which had its enabling legislation amended in 2010 to allow the provincial government to compel ICBC to pay dividends into the provincial treasury.  Versus private auto insurance  Arguments over public versus private provision of auto insurance often revolve around price and treatment of claimants. Ultimately, the question of which system is more efficient remains an open one. The principled arguments for private insurance turn on the ‘disciplining’ effect of market competition. With regard to price, proponents of private insurance argue that an open and competitive market for auto insurance would force providers to be cost-efficient and to compete on price, therefore resulting in lower premiums. However, those in favour of public insurance provision argue that, since private companies would also have to make profits for their owners, a non-profit entity would be more likely to have low premiums. With regard to claimants themselves, proponents of private insurance argue that competition will force private insurers to treat claimants as fairly as possible, since insureds will simply change providers if they feel mistreated. The counterargument to this is, given that all private insurers have similar profit pressures, they will all be similarly reluctant to pay benefits in order to increase their profit margins, thus resulting in insureds being poorly served no matter which insurer they choose - whereas a public insurer operating on a long-run break-even basis would have more flexibility to fully compensate claimants. On an empirical level, cost comparisons across jurisdictions are difficult for several reasons. First, different jurisdictions use different insurance models. British Columbia, for example, uses a tort model with some no-fault accident benefits; Saskatchewan offers consumers a choice between no-fault and tort policies; Manitoba uses a no- fault model with the option to sue for economic damages in excess of no-fault benefits; and Québec uses a pure no-fault model with no option to sue. Second, mandated minimum levels of coverage and benefits can vary widely, even between provinces that use similar insurance models. Third, what is covered within a given category, such as medical benefits, may also differ between jurisdictions. Fourth, different parts of the country differ in areas such as demographics and weather, which may affect the costs of claims as well as accident frequency. Lastly, comparisons with other countries - and the United States in particular - are difficult since Canada’s public healthcare system covers medical costs that would otherwise often be borne by auto insurers. Because of this, it is difficult to conduct accurate comparisons of premiums across the country. An analysis that does not disclose its methodology, or that uses premium data drawn from multiple outside sources, is likely to be unreliable. As would be expected, these complicating factors have resulted in various comparative studies of premiums across the country reaching different conclusions. For example, studies by the Consumers' Association of Canada found that rates in the four public-provision provinces are lower than in provinces that use a private auto insurance system.Consumers' Association of Canada, \\"Consumers' Association National Study On Auto Insurance Rates Confirms Toronto Consumers Pay The Highest Rates In Canada\\" , September 10, 2003 On the other hand, the Fraser Institute, a right-wing think-tank, released a study in 2011 which concluded that the highest auto insurance rates in Canada were paid in Ontario, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, of which the latter three operate public insurers.Fraser Institute, \\"The Personal Cost and Affordability of Auto Insurance in Canada: 2011 Edition\\" , April 12, 2014 More recently, a 2015 Deloitte analysis conducted for Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI) found that the four provinces with public provision have the cheapest insurance rates.  In British Columbia  The Insurance Corporation of British Columbia was created in 1973 by the NDP government of premier Dave Barrett. While it was initially opposed by the opposition Social Credit Party, ICBC became popular with the public and its continued existence has been supported by the government of the day ever since. ICBC initially held a monopoly on all auto insurance, though in 1977 the provincial government opened up the optional insurance market.McCandless 102. Despite the entrance of several firms in the 1980s, in 2003, 87% of British Columbians who bought additional coverage did so from ICBC.McCandless 110. Since its inception, ICBC’s mandate has changed several times. While initially it was responsible for only insurance, at various points since its creation it has also been responsible for social programs (e.g., the CounterAttack anti- impaired driving initiative), traffic safety initiatives, vehicle and driver licensing, commercial transport and compliance, fine collection, and driver education.McCandless 104-7. In 2010, ICBC’s enabling legislation, the Insurance Corporation Act, was amended by Christy Clark’s BC Liberal government to allow the Cabinet Committee to compel ICBC to pay specified dividends into the provincial treasury. Over the next several years, this arguably had a large negative impact on ICBC’s financial position and has been pointed to as the underlying cause of ICBC’s forecast for dramatic rate increases totalling over 40%.  In Manitoba  Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI) was created in 1971 by an NDP government under the leadership of Edward Schreyer. It had featured prominently in his campaign platform for the 1969 election. It is a non-profit Crown corporation that operates on a pure no- fault model.Manitoba Public Insurance, \\"2013 Rate Application: Comparison of Basic Policies: 2012-3 Insurance Year.\\" 1. Accessed July 13, 2017.  In Quebec  In 1978, the Parti Québécois government of René Lévesque created the Régie de l'assurance automobile du Québec (RAAQ). In 1990, the RAAQ became the Société de l'assurance automobile du Québec (SAAQ). In Quebec, public auto insurance is limited to coverage of personal injuries while damage to property is covered by private insurers.Insurance Bureau of Canada, \\"Car Insurance- Quebec\\" , accessed March 8, 2008  In Saskatchewan  Created in 1945 by Tommy Douglas's CCF government, Saskatchewan Government Insurance is the oldest public auto insurer in Canada. Saskatchewan is the only province in Canada that offers motorists a choice between no-fault and tort systems of insurance.  Elsewhere in Canada  Other provinces have considered introducing a public auto insurance system. The Ontario New Democratic Party won the 1990 provincial election on a platform that included public auto insurance. After assuming office, Premier Bob Rae appointed Peter Kormos, one of the most vocal proponents of public insurance, as the minister responsible for bringing forward the policy.Derek Ferguson, \\"Minister says he'll propose public system\\", Toronto Star, October 2, 1990, A9. With the onset of the recession, however, both business and labour groups expressed concern about layoffs and lost revenues.James Daw, \\"Auto plan could cost $1.6 billion firms say\\", Toronto Star, February 7, 1991, C1; James Rusk, \\"Car insurance study gets attention\\", Globe and Mail, April 4, 1991, B6. The government dropped the policy in 1991, which was one reason for its loss of power in 1995. Public auto insurance has also been considered in New Brunswick after private insurance rates nearly doubled from 2003 to 2005 but was ultimately rejected by the provincial government.\\\\- Auto Insurance Reform: New Brunswick It was also an issue in Nova Scotia during its 2003 provincial election and remained in the platform of the official opposition, the Nova Scotia New Democratic Party during the 2006 election campaign. However, it did not appear in the NDP platform in the 2009 campaign, and during the NDP's majority government, they didn't introduce a public insurance scheme. Public auto insurance was also under consideration by the Newfoundland and Labrador Progressive Conservative government of Danny Williams in 2004 as a \\"last resort\\" when private insurance firms threatened to pull out of the province in response to legislation rolling back premiums. \\"Even Newfoundland is looking at public auto insurance\\" , NUPGE, June 6, 2004 See also *Saskatchewan Government Insurance *Insurance Corporation of British Columbia *Société de l'assurance automobile du Québec *Manitoba Public Insurance *Vehicle insurance References Vehicle insurance Canadian transport law Insurance in Canada ","title":"Public auto insurance"},{"id":"15998373","text":"Bula Choudhury (born 2 January 1970, Hugli, India) is an Arjuna awardee, Padma shri awardee, former India national women's swimming champion and elected as MLA from 2006 To 2011 in West Bengal state of India.

Biography Zuev was born on in the Siberian city of Tümen in a white-collar family. Zuev studied in Leningrad State University to major in the historical studies of the Eastern countries, successfully learning Classical Chinese, Middle Chinese, and modern Chinese. In 1955, Zuev received a B.A. diploma and was sent to work in the Institute of History, Archeology and Ethnography of the Kazakh SSR Academy of Sciences. He received his Ph.D. in 1967. His PhD thesis \\"Ancient Turkic genealogical legends as a source on early history of Turkic people\\" published a number of new discoveries about socio-political history of Turks, suggested etymology of the name of the Ashina tribe, traced historical past of the Turkic tribes in the Chinese genealogical legends, suggested a hypothesis about an ethnic triumvirate of Ashina-Ashide-Basmyl. It turned out that a main achievement in that publication became the etymology of the name of the Kagan tribe Ashina. Zuev was a collaborator in fundamental editions of the USSR history: \\"Historical Atlas of the USSR peoples\\", \\"Historical atlas of the Kazakh SSR\\", and five-volume edition \\"History of the Kazakh SSR from most ancient times to the present\\". The mass of Zuev's work included analysis of the Kazakhstan and Central Asian political history from the 3rd century BC to the 3rd century AD, history of ancient and medieval periods, ethnical composition and movement of tribes in the Western Turkic Kaganate, pre- Mongolian period (10th–12th centuries) history. Zuev wrote about genesis, ethnic composition and political history of the Türgesh Kaganate. After the fall of the USSR, Zuev was able to publish a number of works on ancient and medieval history of nomadic peoples of the Central Asia and Kazakhstan. These are \\"Sarmato-Alans of Aral (Yancai\\\\Abzoya)\\" (1995), \\"Ancient Turkic social terminology in the Chinese texts of the 8th century\\" (1998), \\"Creation of Türgesh Kaganate: history and tradition\\" (1996), \\"Forms of the ethno-social organization of Central Asia nomadic peoples in antiquity and Middle Ages: pied horde, centuria (comparative – typological study)\\" (1998), \\"Kypchak Urbe- khan in epos and history\\" (2001), \\"Manichaeism and Talas (interpretation of Ancient Turkic inscriptions)\\" (2002), and others.

Although assistants are not required under the Laws, at most organised levels of football the match officiating crew consists of the referee and at least two assistant referees. The responsibilities of the various assistant referees are listed in Law 6, \\"The Other Match Officials\\". In the current Laws the term \\"assistant referee\\" technically refers only to the two officials who generally patrol the touchlines, with the wider range of assistants to the referee given other titles. The assistant referees' duties generally consist of judging when the ball has left the field of play – including which team is entitled to return the ball to play, judging when an offside offence has occurred, and advising the referee when an infringement of the Laws has occurred out of his or her view. These two officials are typically positioned on opposite touchlines, and each stay beside different halves of the pitch. At higher levels of play the referee is also assisted by a fourth official. The fourth official's duties are usually administrative in nature, such as supervising the substitution procedures, and he or she will generally spend the game in the vicinity of the teams' technical areas. Competition rules will mandate procedures for replacing officials who are unable to continue. Often, the fourth official will replace the referee or one of the assistant referees if they are unable to continue. The Laws also allow for designated reserve assistant referees who have no other responsibilities unless called upon to replace a member of the officiating team who is unable to continue. At very high-level games there may be further assistant referees. Additional assistant referees are positioned to observe incidents near the two goals. Video assistant referees view footage of the game and can advise the referee to review decisions that may have been incorrect. The referee is the sole arbiter of the Laws during the match. Assistants' calls and judgements are considered to be advisory and can be overruled by the referee. General duties As outlined in Law 6 of the Laws of the Game, the officiating team works together to enforce the Laws during a game, though the referee remains the final decision maker in all matters. The assistant referees (including additional assistant referees if present) and the fourth official are expected to advise the referee if they have a clearer view of any particular incident. At the highest levels of play, particularly in matches held in large stadiums, the entire officiating crew may be equipped with wireless microphones and earpieces to facilitate vocal communication across long distances or through loud stadium noise. Having a team of assistants allows for the replacement of officials if one or more are unable to continue. The system of who replaces who is a matter for the organising competition. All officials wear uniforms that match that of the referee, though the fourth official will often wear a tracksuit over the kit in colder weather. Roles =Assistant referee= The diagonal system of control. In this the two assistant referees stay on opposite touchlines in opposite halves. Partick Thistle and Dundee United Law 6 of the Laws of the Game specifies that \\"two assistant referees may be appointed\\". The assistant referees move along the touchlines, each covering their own half of the field of play. In general, assistant referees are responsible for assisting the referee with: * whether the whole ball has passed outside the field of play * which side is entitled to return the ball into the field of play * offside offence decisions * managing substitutions (where no fourth official is present) * identifying offences or other infringements where the referee does not have an adequate view All decisions by the assistant referees are only advisory to the referee; their decisions are not binding and the referee is allowed to overrule an assistant. An assistant referee may also be called upon by the referee to provide an opinion regarding matters which the referee requires clarification on. Occasionally the assistant referee will assist in player management during free kicks, as well as provide visual assistance during penalty kicks. The assistant referees also usually assist the referee with preparatory and administrative functions. Assistant referees carry brightly coloured flags (usually red, yellow, or some pattern involving those colours) which are used to indicate their decisions to the referee, players, and spectators. During the game each assistant referee oversees one touch-line and one end of the field utilising the diagonal system of control. The more senior of the two assistants will normally occupy the side of the field containing the technical areas, to help oversee substitutions. At higher levels of play, the assistant referees' flags may be equipped with buttons that the assistant referee may press to send an audible signal to the referee in order to get the referee's attention. Assistant referees were formerly called linesmen. In 1996, the name was changed, primarily to better reflect the modern role of these officials, and secondarily to become non-gender specific, though the term is still in widespread unofficial use. They are also sometimes incorrectly referred to as \\"referee's assistants\\". =Fourth official= The fourth official (also known as the reserve referee, replacement referee, or simply RR) assists the referee in a variety of tasks, and may be called upon to replace another match official. The practice of having a named replacement referee was introduced in 1966 by English referee and administrator Ken Aston, but the International Football Association Board (IFAB) did not officially create the position until 1991, and listed only areas of responsibility. The fourth official is simply instructed to assist the referee at all times, and their duties are largely at the discretion of the referee. The fourth official typically has a table a short distance from the touchline between the two teams' technical areas, however their positioning is not defined by the Laws of the Game. Fourth official indicating there should be a minimum of two minutes of injury-time played In general, fourth officials are responsible for assisting the referee with: * administrative functions before, during and after the match * assessment of players' equipment; * managing substitutions, including using a numbered board or electronic display where supplied * notifying, by means of numbered boards or electronic displays where supplied, the time added on at the end of each half * acting as the contact point between the match officiating crew and any outside agents (such as stadium managers, security personnel and ball retrievers) * maintaining decorum in the teams' technical areas * identifying offences or other infringements where the referee does not have an adequate view In practice, the fourth official becomes a key member of the officiating team, who can watch the field and players and advise the referee on situations that are going on out of their sight. The fourth official keeps an extra set of records, and helps make sure the referee does not make a serious error such as cautioning the wrong player, or giving two cautions to the same player and forgetting to send off the player.Refereeing & Disciplinary – The Fourth Official: the Scottish Football Association website. Retrieved on 28 February 2008. Where the fourth official is a junior member of the officiating team, they are generally expected to replace an assistant referee where they are unable to continue to perform their duties (either due to injury or replacing the main referee). However, in most high-level competitions, the fourth official is a designated referee (as opposed to assistant) and therefore replaces the referee in cases where they are unable to continue. =Additional assistant referee= An additional referee for the goal line The additional assistant referee (AAR) is an official that assists the referee behind the goal line to assist the referee in observing any incident that may occur near the penalty area. Recent trials, for example at the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League group stage, have been started to make place for an additional two assistant referees to be added to the game, positioned behind the goal lines, to \\"ensure that the Laws of the Game are upheld, informing the referee of incidents of any kind that they may otherwise have missed, particularly in key areas of the field like the penalty area and its surroundings,\\" but only informing the referee of their observations through a wireless communication system. Their positioning also gives a good view to assist the referee in \\"ghost goal\\"-type incidents. The trial was evaluated by IFAB technical experts. This trial was later extended to the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League and qualifying games and the final tournament for the UEFA Euro 2012. Their reception has been mixed. Following a two-year experiment in the UEFA Champions League, Europa League and Euro 2012, as well as the AFC President's Cup and competitions in Brazil, France, Italy, Morocco and Qatar, the use of additional assistant referees was approved by the International Football Association Board (IFAB) in July 2012. Additional assistant referees were used in the 2013 Scottish Cup Final, the first time they had been utilised in a domestic match in Scottish football. =Video assistant referee= The video assistant referee (VAR) is an official, who will also have assistants themselves, that reviews decisions made with the use of video footage and a headset for communication with the on-field referee. Their use by competitions is optional. = Fifth official and reserve assistant referee= The fifth official was an official meant to serve as a replacement for either of the assistant referees in the unlikely event of an injury or incident that would prevent the assistant from continuing the game. For matches in the 2006 World Cup, FIFA assigned five officials. The role of the fifth official was to assist the fourth official in a variety of tasks, and potentially be called upon to replace another match official if necessary, for example in the case of injury.Definition of the fifth official: PDF file (page 8) quoting the \\"IFAB Agenda 2007\\". Retrieved on 14 May 2012. If an assistant referee could not carry on their duties, the fifth official was to be the primary replacement, whereas the fourth official was the referee's primary replacement. This distinction was made to reflect the fact that assistant referees and referees perform different tasks. The fifth official had access to television coverage of the match, but was not permitted to advise the on- field referees of any incidents they had missed. Speaking after the 2006 FIFA World Cup Final, Italy coach Marcello Lippi claimed that the referee had sent off France player Zinedine Zidane after receiving advice from \\"the fourth and fifth officials looking at the video at the edge of the pitch\\". These claims were subsequently denied by FIFA. In the current Laws of the Game the role of the fifth official has been reduced to that of the reserve assistant referee (RAR, also known as the reserve official). They have no duties other than to replace an assistant referee or fourth official who is unable to continue.

Today the building is used as a vocational school. There are now in Smolensk two synagogues and five Chadarim. History Choral Synagogue (Smolensk) There were the first Jews in Smolensk in the 15th century, when Prince Vitoft of Lithuania got Smolensk in 1404 and granted it the Magdeburg rights and other privileges. 1728 the Jewish businessmen have acquired the right to come in Smolensk on trading affairs. 4,600 Jews - 10% of the total population, were mentioned in Smolensk in the 19th century. Though Smolensk was not included into feature of settled way of life, in the 18th and 19th centuries the number of Jews in the city gradually increased and in 1896 had reached 4651 persons (about ten percent of the city's population). Jews traded in wood, flax and grain and were engaged in financial activities. In the beginning of the 20th century in Smolensk there were two synagogues and five chadarim and a Jewish initial school created on the basis of the Talmud. The society of the help to the poor Jews was founded in 1898. In 1910, the Jews of Smolensk were victims of a bloody pogrom; in city there were rabble-rousing conditions. In the 1st World War in Smolensk there has arrived the big number of the Jews run or moved from a front strip, in particular, from Latvia. After an establishment in Smolensk under the Soviet authority (November, 1917) a gradual liquidation of the Jewish establishments began. In 1922 the Choral synagogue was confiscated by the Soviet authorities. The next years number of the Jewish population of city continued to grow and to 1926 has reached 12 887 person (16,2% of all population). In 1929 to Smolensk from Gomel the Jewish pedagogical school worked under aegis Евсекции has been translated. 13,000 Jews - 8% of the total population were in Smolensk before the beginning of the war. In days of fights for Smolensk many Jews were lost, the part ran from city. After final occupation of Smolensk nazis have created a ghetto in suburb Sadki and have driven there about two thousand the Jews remained in city and its vicinities. By December, 1941 all of them have been destroyed. According to population censuses, in 1959 in Smolensk there lived 3929 Jews, in 1970–3662, in 1979–3223, in 1989–2645. Synagogues in city during the post-war period were not. Number of the Jewish population of Smolensk area in 1959 has made 5991 person, in 1970–5316 person, in 1979–4451 person, in 1989–3536 person.

Reproduction and rearing The species is of interest for aquaculture for food production (and indirectly as conservation measure because it may lower the fishing pressure on wild population), as well as for production of fish. Maturation in earthen tanks of fish caught in the wild is not problematic, since manipulation of fish during fishing and transportation is well done.

History The first Condor F-WBIX first flew in 1956. The Condor was an evolution of the Druine Turbi, but featured an extensively revised fuselage allowing the pilot and instructor to sit side by side under a full canopy. Norman Jones, the founder of the Tiger Club and owner of Rollason Aircraft & Engines, had already had a number of Druine Turbulents built by his company and hit upon the idea of developing the Condor for the demands of club flying. With a number of refinements to the design, Rollason Aircraft and Engines undertook series production at Croydon Airport from 1961 as the Rollason Condor. As Croydon had closed for flying in 1959, all aircraft were transported to Redhill, where they were reassembled and test flown. Norman Jones was keenly interested in the development of Flying Clubs and so made Condors available on favourable loan terms. To emphasise the fact that his company was entirely independent and un-subsidised, Norman Jones had painted on the rudder of one aircraft the legend \\"British Made - Private Enterprise and No Taxpayers Money\\". In 1973, Rollasons ceased all aircraft work at Croydon and moved to Shoreham where a single Condor was completed. A number of unfinished fuselages were sold off for possible completion as amateur-built aircraft; one of these was G-BADM, registered to Rollasons in 1972 and subsequently completed in 1994 by an amateur.http://www.rollason- condor.co.uk/histories/badm.htm Borea in France also produced the D.61 Condor.

The main hall inside the temple is the Hall for Worship of Ancestors, which is one of only four buildings in Beijing to stand on a three-tiered platform, a hint that it was the most sacred site in imperial Beijing. It contains seats and beds for the tablets of emperors and empresses, as well as incense burners and offerings. On the occasion of large-scale ceremonies for worship of ancestors, the emperors would come here to participate. Flanking the courtyard in front of this hall are two long, narrow buildings. These were worship halls for various princes and courtiers. The Western Wing housed the memorial tablets of meritorious courtiers, while the Eastern Wing enshrined various princes of the Ming or Qing dynasty. Behind the Hall for Worship of Ancestors are two other main halls. The first was built in 1420 and used to store imperial ancestral tablets. By the 1920s, the Imperial Ancestral Temple and its surrounding spaces had become a public park, and that public park today has been expanded from its original size and is now also known as the Working People's Cultural Palace (劳动人民文化宫; pinyin: Láodòng Rénmín Wénhuà Gōng). This park was extended based on the Imperial Ancestral Hall site, and the park is located east of Tiananmen, while the Zhongshan Park lies to the west.

It allows users to create abstract knowledge representations such as those required by the Semantic Web using a natural language interface. Natural language understanding (NLU) technology is not employed. Instead, natural language generation (NLG) is used in a highly interactive manner. The text editor accepts repeated refinement of a selected span of text as it becomes increasingly less vacuous of authored semantics. Using a mouse, a text property held in the evolving text can be further refined by a set of options derived by NLG from a built-in ontology. An invisible representation of the semantic knowledge is created which can be used for multilingual document generation, formal knowledge formation, or any other task that requires formally specified information. The two projects at Brighton worked in the field of Conceptual Authoring to lay a foundation for further research and development of a Semantic Web Authoring Tool (SWAT). This tool has been further explored as a means for developing a knowledge base by those without prior experience with Controlled Natural Language tools.

It competed in the Tasmanian Football League (TFL/TANFL) as a junior club from 1901 to 1907, and as a senior club between 1908 and 1941. They were known as the Canaries and wore black and gold as their club colours. In 1942, the TFL competition was suspended indefinitely due to World War II. The club did not resume competition after the war and, to all intents and purposes, the former Cananore Football Club was transformed into what is now the Hobart Football Club.

Cananore played as a junior club between 1901 and 1907; and, as a junior club, played their matches at West Hobart Oval (the current school oval of the Lansdowne Crescent School) . Cananore gained senior club status for the 1908 TFL season; and, from then, played their home games at the Tasmanian Cricket Association Ground. The name of the Cananore Football Club was derived from a misspelt plaque on a large family home, which had been a gathering point for fans of the club in its formative years. The house is long demolished and the plaque is now displayed in the Hobart Football Clubrooms. The club were TFL/TANFL premiers eleven times and Tasmanian State Premiers on ten occasions. The Canaries' final season of football was the 1941 TANFL Season under coach J.Cashmore. The club would go into recess due to World War Two, and, in 1944, TANFL executives drew up a plan to turn the competition into a regulated, district-based format upon resumption of the League in 1945, rather than the previous motley collection of clubs. As a result of these changes, Cananore was replaced in the TANFL by the Hobart Football Club who would go on to share the same black and gold colours, same home ground (TCA Ground) and many of the same players and supporters from Cananore would go on to be involved with Hobart for many years to come. Tasmanian Football Hall of Fame On 18 May 2010, AFL Tasmania announced that the Cananore Football Club and Hobart Football Club would be inducted together in the Great Clubs category of the Tasmanian Football Hall of Fame. Notable footballers Two Cananore footballers to have been inducted in the Australian Football Hall of Fame are Albert Collier, who was also known for his long career at Victorian Football League club , and Horrie Gorringe, who played his entire career at Cananore.

Local shareholders were local nobility (Pallavicino and Balbi), bankers (Quartara, Polleri) and merchants (Lagorio, Dodero, Bacigalupo), creating an initial capital of 3 million Italian lira. It acquired \\"Banca Vonwiller\\" of Milan. In the 1890s, the international financial crisis led to refinancing by German and Swiss banks and name change to \\"Credito Italiano\\" (1895) With a paid-in capital of 14 million lire. It now became a major national bank Later, it acquired \\"Banca Manzi\\" of Rome (1901) and \\"Banca Meuricoffre\\" of Naples (1905). Its headquarters moved to Piazza Cordusio opened a branch office in London in 1911. By 1913 the equity capital reached 75 million lire, and its savings and demand deposits grew very rapidly. It became a major source of funding for Italian industry in the prosperous years 1896-1913, especially iron and steel, electric power, sugar-beet refining, urban transportation, and chemicals. =First World War= At the commencement of the First World War, the executive directors of Credito Italiano and the Banca Commerciale Italiana – another German funded bank in Italy – were officially in favour of neutrality. However these banks were the subject of a campaign by both Italian nationalists, spearheaded by L'Idea Nazionale and Liberals grouped around Francesco Saverio Nitti. Both these political initiatives had links with business rivals Gio. Ansaldo & C. and Banca Italiana di Sconto. =Post war expansion= Following the war it acquired the \\"Banca del Monferrato\\", \\"Banca di Legnano\\", \\"Credito Varesino and the Swiss Banca Unione di Credito (1919), and in 1920 it joined the \\"Compagnia Finanziaria Nazionale\\" (1920); and established \\"Banca Italo-cinese\\", the \\"Banca Italo Viennese\\" and \\"Tiroler Hauptbank\\" (1920). In 1921 it opened offices in Paris and Berlin and later contributed to the establishments of Banca Italo Egiziana (1924) and Banca Nazionale di Albania (1925).It was highly profitable in the boom years 1922 – 1925, thanks to the success of Italian industry. Decline set in after 1925. As a result of the great depression, it went bankrupt and was nationalized, but became active again with funding from Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (1933–1990s). Italian government introduced a law that forced bank to separate short term loan and medium loan business in 1936. Credito Italiano, along with two other \\"bank of national interests\\", BCI and Banco di Roma, had formed Mediobanca in 1946. =Privatization and expansion= In the 1990s the bank became a private company, as Italian government sold the stake of the bank. The bank also acquired Banca Popolare di Spoleto (about 50%) in 1992 and Banca Cattolica di Molfetta (35%) in 1994.

His writings were particularly influential in Spain, where they were resisted by his fellow Minim Francisco Palanco.http://www.scholasticon.fr/nomenP.htm#palanco , in FrenchJonathan Israel, Radical Enlightenment: Philosophy and the Making of Modernity, 1650-1750 (2001), p. 331. Life His father was dean of the Chancery of Toulouse, and his mother's father was professor of medicine at the University of Toulouse. He studied the humanities at the Jesuit college. At the age of eighteen he joined the Order of Minims. His instructor in philosophy was a follower of Aristotle, but Maignan soon began to dispute and oppose all that seemed to him false in Aristotle's teachings, especially of physics. He preferred Plato to Aristotle. He mastered the mathematics of the day, practically without aid from anyone. At the end of a few years his ability was recognized by his superiors and he was given charge of the instruction of novices. In 1636 he was called to Rome by the general of the order to teach mathematics at the convent of the Trinità dei Monti. There he lived for fourteen years, engaged in mathematics and in physical experiments, and publishing his work on gnomonics and perspective. In 1650 he returned to Toulouse and was made provincial. When his three years were up, he was glad to devote himself entirely to his studies. When Louis XIV, having seen his machines and curiosities at Toulouse, invited him to Paris, in 1669, through Cardinal Mazarin, he begged to be allowed to pass his life in the seclusion of the convent. Works His published works are: *\\"Perspectiva horaria sive de horographia gnomonica tum theoretica tum practica\\" (4 vols., Rome, 1648); *\\"Cursus philosophicus\\" (1st ed., 4 vols., Toulouse, 1652; 2nd ed. with changes and additions, Lyons, 1673); *\\"Sacra philosophia entis supernaturalis\\" (Lyons, 1662, 1st vol., and 1672, 2nd vol.); *\\"Dissertatio theologica de usu licito pecuniæ\\" (Lyons, 1673).

While the design was a conventional pod-and-boom layout, the propulsion system was unusual in that it used a turbine engine, not to drive the rotor directly, but to provide a source of hot gas that was fed through the rotor shaft, along the blades, and out through tip jets. The intention was to eliminate the weight and mechanical complexity of a gearbox and an anti-torque system for the tail. This engine system underwent extensive static tests while a full-size mockup was built to prove the aerodynamics in a wind tunnel. Ultimately, however, the programme was cancelled in 1969 before a prototype was actually constructed.

It was founded in 1839 as the Microscopical Society of London making it the oldest organisation of its kind in the world. In 1866, the society gained its royal charter and took its current name. Founded as a society of amateurs, its membership consists of individuals of all skill levels in numerous related fields from throughout the world. Every year since 1852, the society has published its own scientific journal, the Journal of Microscopy, which contains peer-reviewed papers and book reviews. The society is a registered charity that is dedicated to advancing science, developing careers and supporting wider understanding of science and microscopy through its Outreach activities. Probably the society's greatest contribution is its standardised 3x1 inches microscope glass slides in 1840, which are still the most widely used size today and known as the \\"RMS standard\\". The Royal Microscopical Society is a member of the Foundation for Science and Technology, the Biosciences Federation, the European Microscopy Society and the International Federation of Societies for Microscopy. History Alfred William Bennett, botanist, publisher, early vice-president and editor of the Journal of Microscopy from 1897 until his death in 1902. On 3 September 1839 a meeting of 17 gentlemen including physicist Joseph Jackson Lister, photography pioneer Joseph Bancroft Reade, the botanists Edwin John Quekett and Richard Kippist, and artist and inventor Cornelius Varley, was held at Quekett's residence at 50 Wellclose Square to take into consideration the propriety of forming a society for the promotion of microscopical investigation, and for the introduction and improvement of the microscope as a scientific instrument, following a decade of great advances in the field of microscopy. At this gathering it was agreed that a society should be founded and a committee appointed. It was named the Microscopical Society of London and a constitution was drawn up. On 20 December 1839, a public meeting was held at the Horticultural Society's rooms at 21 Regents Street in London. At the convention, Professor Richard Owen was elected President, along with Nathaniel Ward as Treasurer, and Farre as Secretary. A Council was also appointed, consisting of J.S. Bowerbank, Thomas Edwards, Dr F. Farre, George Gwilt, George Jackson, Dr John Lindley, George Loddiges, the Rev. C. Pritchard, Edwin John Quekett, M.J. Rippingham, Richard Horsman Solly and Robert Warington. With them, forty-five men were enrolled as members. At its foundation, the Society acquired the best microscopes then obtainable from the three leading makers, Powell & Lealand, Ross, and Smith. The first president of the society was palaeontologist Sir Richard Owen who is best known for coining the word \\"dinosaur\\" and for his role in creation London's Natural History Museum. It was renamed the Royal Microscopical Society in 1866, when the Society received its Royal Charter under the Presidency of James Glaisher. Its governing documents are its Charter and By-laws. In 1870, then President, the Rev. Joseph Bancroft Reade, in his maiden speech revealed that he had suggested adding the suffix \\"-al\\" to the name of the fledgling society to prevent \\"the possibility of ourselves being mistaken for microscopic objects\\". John Thomas Quekett (brother of co-founder Edwin John Quekett) served as the society's secretary from 1841 to 1860. Distinguished botanist Dukinfield Henry Scott served as president of the society between 1904 and 1906 In 1885, botanist and women's rights campaigner Marian Farquharson, became the first female Fellow of the Society. Although not permitted to attend meetings, her greatest contribution to the scientific community was of her campaign in gaining women rights to full fellowship of learned societies. In 1900 she sent a letter addressed to the Royal Society and the Linnean Society petitioning that \\"duly qualified women should be eligible for ordinary Fellowship and, if elected, there should be no restriction forbidding their attendance at meetings\\". Both societies refused her requests to join, eventually the Linnean Society elected her as a fellow in 1908. In September 1989, Royal Mail released a set of four stamps to mark the celebration of the Society's 150th anniversary entitled \\"Microscopes\\", one of which being the snowflake, its own logo. In 2017, the society appointed two patrons, Baroness Brown of Cambridge and Baroness Finlay of Llandaff, both of whom are members of the House of Lords. Membership RMS members come from a wide range of backgrounds within the biological and physical sciences. After three years of continuous Ordinary Membership, members are invited to become a Fellow of the Society after a set number of criteria have been met, which allows for individuals to benefit from voting and election rights as well as the use of the post-nominal letters FRMS after their names. =Honorary Fellows= The society elects a maximum of 65 persons as Honorary Fellows. Publications =Journal of Microscopy= Illustration of Professor Henfreys paper on some Fresh-water Con-fervoid Algae, new to Britain (1853) The Journal of Microscopy provides a forum for publication, discussion, and education for scientists and technologists who use any form of microscopy or image analysis. This includes technology and applications in physics, chemistry, material and biological sciences. The journal publishes review articles, original research papers, short communications, and letters to the editor, covering all aspects of microscopy. It is published on behalf of the Society by Wiley-Blackwell. =infocus Magazine= infocus Magazine is the society's magazine for members. It provides a common forum for scientists and technologists from all disciplines which use any form of microscope, including all branches of microscopy and microbeam analysis. infocus features articles on microscopy related topics, techniques and developments, reports on RMS events, book reviews, news and much more. Published four times a year, infocus is free to members. Outreach activities The society is heavily involved with outreach activities, particularly those aimed at children, where the aim is to interest them in science as a whole as opposed to simply lab work. In late 2015, the society was one of many \\"subject experts\\" consulted by awarding organisations as a part of a consultation by the Department for Education regarding reforms to the course content of the subject of Geology at GCE Advanced Level (A-level) in the national curriculum. Other advising parties included British Geological Survey, Natural History Museum and the Royal School of Mines. =Microscope Activity Kit Scheme= One such method is through the use of the Microscope Activity Kit Scheme starting in March 2011, a free scheme sending fully equipped Kits of microscopes and ready-to-go activities to Primary Schools throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland for a term at a time. By December 2014, the Kits had gone from 2 to 50 and had been used by over 20,000 children in the UK.Microscope Activity Kits - Royal Microscopical Society website =RMS Diploma= The RMS Diploma, launched in 2012 to replace the former RMS DipTech qualification, aims to help microscopists advance in their careers by improving and refining their skills to gain a distinguished qualification. The Diploma from the Royal Microscopical Society is attained via a flexible portfolio-based course of study that is designed by the candidate with the assistance of their line- manager, and with input from existing Fellows of the Society. This approach ensures that the study is both challenging and rewarding whilst fitting with, and complementing, the candidate's existing employment. =Courses and conferences= Each year the RMS hosts a programme full of meetings, courses and conferences. These events provide opportunities for keeping abreast of the very latest developments and attract speakers of the highest quality and delegates active in all areas of science from forensics to flow cytometry, live cell imaging to SPM. = Gender equality = Since 2017 the RMS website has hosted a database of women working in microscopy to aid conference and meeting organisers in creating more diverse speaker line-ups for events. Female scientists can either add themselves to the database or be nominated for inclusion.

Mark is rather an ascetic than a dogmatic writer. He is content to accept dogmas from the Church; his interest is in the spiritual life as it should be led by monks. He is practical rather than mystic, belongs to the Antiochene School and shows himself to be a disciple of John Chrysostom. Identification Various theories about his period and works have been advanced. According to Johannes Kunze, Mark the Hermit was superior of a laura at Ancyra; he then as an old man left his monastery and became a hermit, probably in the desert east of Palestine, near Mar Saba. He was a contemporary of Nestorius and died probably before the Council of Chalcedon (451). Nicephorus Callistus (fourteenth century) says he was a disciple of John Chrysostom.\\"Hist. Eccl.\\" in Patrologia Graeca, CXLVI, XlV, 30. Cardinal BellarmineDe Script. eccl. (1631), p. 273. thought that this Mark was the monk who prophesied ten more years of life to the Emperor Leo VI in 900. He is refuted by Tillemont.Memoires (1705), X, 456 sq. Another view supported by the Byzantine MenaiaActa Sanct. March 1. identifies him with the Egyptian monk mentioned in Palladius,Historia Lausiaca, XX (P.G., XXXII. who lived in the fourth century. The discovery and identification of a work by him against Nestorius by P. KerameusIn his Analekta ierosol. stachyologias (St. Petersburg, 1891), I, pp. 89–113 makes his period certain, as defended by Kunze. According to a brief entry in the \\"Great Synaxaristes\\" of the Orthodox Church, his feast day is observed on May 20. Ὁ Ὅσιος Μάρκος ὁ Ἐρημίτης. 20 Μαΐου. ΜΕΓΑΣ ΣΥΝΑΞΑΡΙΣΤΗΣ. Works Mark's works are traditionally the following: # of the spiritual law, # Concerning those who think to be justified through works (both ascetic treatises for monks); # of penitence; # of baptism; # To Nicholas on refraining from anger and lust; # Disputation against a scholar (against appearing to civil courts and on celibacy); # Consultation of the mind with its own soul (reproaches that he makes Adam, Satan, and other men responsible for his sins instead of himself); # on fasting and humility; # on Melchisedek (against people who think that Melchisedek was an apparition of the Word of God).

Alaskan and her near-sistership Olympian were known as \\"Henry Villard's White Elephants.\\"Newell, Gordon R., ed., H.W. McCurdy Marine History of the Pacific Northwest, at 43, 346, n. 10 and 414, Superior Publishing, Seattle 1966 There were a number of vessels named Alaska and Alaskan, this large side-wheel steamboat should not be confused with them. Construction Alaskan was built in 1883 by the Delaware River Iron Ship Building and Engine Works shipyard in Chester, Pennsylvania. She was a sidewheeler driven by a single cylinder vertical condensing walking-beam steam engine, which gave her high speed.Newell, Gordon R., Ships of the Inland Sea, p. 92-96, Binford and Mort, Portland, Oregon (2nd Ed. 1960) Her iron hull was long, and she was rated at 1718 tons. She was built primarily for service on Puget Sound.Mills, Randall V., Sternwheelers Up Columbia, p. 139, 163, and 189, University of Nebraska Press (1977 reprint of 1947 edition) Operations in Pacific Northwest In 1884, Alaskan was brought to the Pacific Northwest through the Strait of Magellan, around South America. Alaskan and Olympian were built to designs popular and successful on Chesapeake Bay. When she arrived in the Pacific Northwest this design proved unsuited for the conditions, and the ship became a steady money loser. Timmen, one of the leading marine historians of the Pacific Northwest, states of Henry Villard that \\"[t]his financial genius, who once monopolized the Northwest's rail and water transportation, must have suffered a lapse of common sense when he ordered the pair constructed in Delaware.\\"Timmen, Fritz, Blow for the Landing, p. 146, Caxton Printers, Caldwell, Idaho 1973 =Columbia River service= Villard's company, the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company first placed Alaskan in service on the Columbia River, where because of her huge size, she could only operate on the deeper water from Portland to Astoria. Her first set of officers included master Capt. James W. Troup (1856–1932), pilot Archie Pease, and engineer Thomas Smith. Alaskan's chief rival on this route was U.B. Scott's Telephone, supposedly then the fastest steamboat in the world. Occasionally the highly skilled Troup and Pease were able to outrun Telephone, then under the command of the equally-skilled river veterans Capt. William H. Whitcomb (1851–1924) and chief engineer Newton Scott. Both Alaskan and Olympian proved too expensive to operate on the Columbia River. The main problem was that they consumed huge quantities of expensive coal.Marshall, Don, Oregon Shipwrecks, p. 55-57, Binford and Mort, Portland, Oregon 1984 =Puget Sound service= Tacoma, W.T. circa 1880 Alaskan moored at Seattle In 1888, unable to make a profit on the Columbia, O.R. & N transferred Alaskan to Puget Sound where together with Olympian she ran from Tacoma, Seattle, and Port Townsend to Victoria and back. She served on this route until 1889. =Need for drydocking= In 1889, Alaskan needed underwater work and maintenance on her hull. However there were no drydocks in the Pacific Northwest. Instead there were only wooden \\"gridirons\\", enormous frames of wood weighted down with rocks placed on a beach or mudflat. When work was needed below the waterline of a vessel, the procedure was simply to float the ship over the gridiron, wait for the tide to run out, and work on the vessel as fast as possible before the tide came back in. No gridiron in the Pacific Northwest was big enough to handle Alaskan, so the decision was made to run her down to San Francisco. Sinking Alaskan left Puget Sound, sailing around the Olympic Peninsula, then up the Columbia and Willamette rivers to Portland. With Capt. R.E. Howes in command, Alaskan then ran back down the Columbia, crossed over the Columbia Bar at 11:30 a.m. on Saturday, May 11, 1889, then turned south for San Francisco at . She ran about off the coast in ballast—carrying no freight or passengers though many had applied—with 34 persons on board. She ran all night, passing the Yaquina Head Lighthouse at 11:00 p.m. running off shore. Weather conditions were good: light wind and rain showers, and the barometer holding steady. By Sunday morning, the wind and wave height had increased. The ship was laboring heavily through the rolling waves offshore at . Alaskan had never been intended to run as an ocean vessel, and she had been worn out by hard driving on the Columbia River. By 3:00 p.m. off Cape Blanco she was in serious trouble as the sidewheels moved at \\"dead slow\\" and green water came in over the bow. The ship could not maintain direction, as a wave would lift one side and its paddle out of the water, then another, so that little or no forward progress could be made. painting depicting sinking of Alaskan The aftercabin worked loose with the securing bolts pulled through the planking. Second Officer Weeks and the crew tried to shove blankets and ticking into the holes to stop the leaks, but the vessel still kept shipping additional tons of water. The ship continued to gradually come apart under the stress. Her iron hull was not breached but her wooden upper works were being torn away by waves. By 6:00 p.m. her condition became irretrievable when the port side paddle box tore away, leaving numerous holes in the hull. The water rose in the hold faster than the pumps could work. By midnight, the boiler fire was extinguished and Alaskan lost all power save for an emergency sail rigged earlier to keep her steadier in the wind. Captain Howes ordered the ship's boats to be launched and towed behind the vessel on a line. Three of the four boats were successfully launched this way, and most of the crew were successfully evacuated, save only five men: Captain Howes, the chief engineer, the second mate, steward Al Rahles, and seaman Denny. As the boats were being launched, the crew saw a light from another ship, and desperately launched two distress rockets to ask for assistance. As the evacuation was going on, a wave broke over the deck and sucked Quartermaster (the seaman who actually steers the ship) Shielderup into the now-exposed side wheel where he was horribly mangled. At about 1:00 a.m. on Monday morning, the ship seemed to be going down so they cut the line to the boats. There was then no way off the Alaskan for the five men left on board. The ship stayed afloat for about another hour and a half. Captain Howes and chief engineer Swain ended up clinging to a fragment of the deck. The pilot house floated by, with three men hanging on to it. Against the captain's advice, the chief struck out swimming for them, but never made it and was not seen again. Rescue of survivors The tug Vigilant, moving slowly because of her tow—a manned barge—had seen the Alaskan's distress rockets, and arrived at the scene Monday evening, when she picked up the three men from the pilot house, and one living man and one dead from a life raft. Vigilant found Captain Howes still hanging on to the deck fragment, which had been gradually getting smaller as seas tore off pieces. He was taken on board after 33 hours in the water. Vigilant picked up the men from the first boat, with the ship's mate on board. A second boat reached shore, but the third boat was never seen again. Quartermaster Shieldrup was picked up alive, his leg nearly severed. He died a short while later and was buried at sea. News accounts said 21 people were lost, although there may have been undocumented stowaways drowned as well.Daily Morning Astorian, 19 May 1889, p.3 The ship was insured for $200,000.

A wide variety of legal mechanisms are employed by debtors to prevent the attachment of their assets. For example, a declaration of bankruptcy will severely limit the ability of creditors to attach the property of the debtor. Many jurisdictions have a homestead exemption or other property exemptions which limit the ability of creditors to attach the debtor's primary residence, vehicle, and/or personal effects.. Prejudgment attachment Prejudgment attachment or Prejudgment writ of attachment allows recovery of money damages by levying a security interest on the property of the party paying money damages. A writ of attachment is filed to secure debt or claim of the creditor in the event that a judgment is rendered. Foreign attachment procedures have existed from time to time in Scotland, where it was known as arrestment; in France, where it was known as saisie arret; in the U.S and elsewhere. (Google Books) Prejudgment attachment in Chinese litigation proceeding can be obtained by the plaintiff before filing the case with court or arbitration commission in the case of emergency where failure to take immediate action will result in irreparable damage to relevant party. However, the party shall file its case with court or arbitration body within thirty days after the prejudgment attachment is granted by courts. John Guest of the Province of Pennsylvania =Historical London procedure= The person holding the property or owing the money had to be within the City at the time of being served with the process, but all persons were entitled to the benefit of the custom. The plaintiff having started the action, and made a satisfactory affidavit of his debt, was entitled to issue attachment, which thereupon affected all the money or property of the defendant in the hands of the third party, the garnishee. The garnishee had all the defences which would be available to him against the defendant, his alleged creditor. If there had been no fraud or collusion, the garnishee could plead payment under the attachment. The court to which this process belonged was the Lord Mayor's Court, the procedure of which was regulated by the Mayor's Court of London Procedure Act 1857. This custom, and all proceedings relating to it, were expressly exempted from the operation of the Debtor's Act 1869.

The track width derives from a scale of 1:160 for rails. Background When N gauge was developed it proved impossible to fit the then available motors into scale models of British prototype locomotives. British railways use a smaller loading gauge than those in Europe and America, resulting in smaller locomotives. A greater body size was required on the models to accommodate the motors, so instead of adopting the correct 1:160 scale, 1:148 was used. This allows larger models, but means that the gauge is not an accurate representation of standard gauge. A similar problem and solution was adopted with OO gauge and British TT gauge in Britain.

He was the reformer of the city of Bern, Switzerland, where the Reformation received little to none opposition. Haller was born at Aldingen in Württemberg. After schooling in Pforzheim, where he established a friendship with Philipp Melanchthon, he studied theology in Cologne. He became a teacher in Rottweil in 1510 and in Bern in 1513, where he was appointed assistant preacher at the church of St Vincent in 1515. In 1520 he became a canon and the people's priest. Even before his acquaintance with Huldrych Zwingli in 1521 he had begun to preach the Reformation, his sympathetic character and his eloquence making him and the painter and writer Niklaus Manuel a great force. Zwingli became his friend and adviser and they began a lively exchange of letters. In 1526, Haller participated in the disputation of Baden, and in 1528 in the Bern disputation, which resulted in the Bernese Reformation edict on 7 February 1528 in which Bern officially decided for the Reformation. Zwingli's 1531 death brought the Reformation in Bern to a crisis, to which the city council reacted by calling the first Bernese Synod with 200 participants. Haller was especially concerned as Zwingli's successor Heinrich Bullinger was unable to attend. However, he received strong support from Wolfgang Capito who arrived in Bern shortly before the opening of the Synod. In 1532 Haller became the leader of the Reformed Church of Bern. He was in contact with Guillaume Farel in the western part of Switzerland and Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich and acted as a mediator between the Calvinist Reformation and Zürich. He died in Bern, leaving no writings except a few letters which are preserved in Zwingli's works. References * Rudolf Dellsperger: Berchtold Haller In: Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz.

Development The Do R was a larger development of the Do J, with a larger high-mounted strut-braced monoplane wing and longer fuselage. All but the first three built also had four engines, in place of the Do J's two. The Do R could carry 19 passengers in two cabins; 11 in the forward cabin and eight in the rear.  Dornier R 2 Superwal  The first R 2 Superwal, (D-1115), made its maiden flight on 30 September 1926. Two 650 hp Rolls-Royce Condor III engines were mounted in tandem in a nacelle above the wing and in line with the hull; one engine drove a tractor propeller and the other drove a pusher propeller. D-1115 was the largest flying boat that could be built in the postwar Dornier factory in Manzell. The Superwal went into service with Severa and later DVS in List, both organisations of the German government, tasked to develop military seaplanes, ignoring restrictions of the Versailles treaty. Two more R 2 Superwals were built in 1927 for Severa (D-1255 and D-1385). D-1255 was periodically operated by Deutsche Luft Hansa and was named Narwal. D-1385 was equipped with 800 hp Packard engines, and remained in service until November 1936.  Dornier R 4 Superwal  Between 20 January and 5 February 1927 Dornier Chief Pilot Richard Wagner established twelve world records for seaplanes with a new R4 Gas Superwal. This aircraft and eleven more with Gnome et Rhône Bristol-Jupiter engines (R4 Gas) or 525 hp Siemens- Bristol-Jupiter engines (R4 Sas) were delivered to the Italian airline Società Anonima Navigazione Aerea (SANA) and Luft Hansa during 1928 and ‘29. Apart from their use by Luft Hansa, six Superwals saw regular service with SANA into the early 1930s on a route along the Italian west coast and on to Spain. Three aircraft were lost during their service. The Superwal I-RUDO (equipped with Isotta Fraschini Asso 500 engines) went into service with the Italian Air Ministry in 1934 and became the last Superwal in Italian service. At least one aircraft was assembled in Spain by CASA.

After the war, she was acquired by the US Army and became USAT General William Weigel. On the outbreak of the Korean War, she was transferred to the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) and designated USNS General William Weigel (T-AP-119), a designation she retained for her later service in the Vietnam War. AP-119 was laid down under Maritime Commission contract 15 March 1944 by the Federal Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company of Kearny, New Jersey; named General C. H. Barth (AP-119) on 15 April 1944; renamed General William Weigel 24 August 1944; launched 3 September 1944; acquired by the Navy 4 January 1945; and commissioned at Bayonne, New Jersey, 6 January 1945, Captain Thomas Y. Awalt, USCG, in command. World War II General William Weigel sailed from New York 11 February 1945 with 5,000 rotation troops; and, after delivering them safely to Le Havre, embarked US and French veterans at Southampton and returned to New York 19 April. Underway again 1 May with Navy men bound for Puerto Rico, the troopship touched at San Juan to debark them and to take on 5,000 Army fighting men for passage to Hawaii. As General William Weigel was steaming toward Pearl Harbor, one of her passengers became critically ill. To save his life, strict radio silence was broken to arrange a mid-ocean rendezvous with a seaplane out of Balboa. He was transferred to the seaplane 19 May and flown to a hospital; General William Weigel reached Honolulu 6 days later. This far ranging ship sailed 28 May for Marseilles to embark 5,000 soldiers and transferred them to Eniwetok and Manila to take part in the climactic Pacific battles. Subsequently she loaded passengers at Leyte and returned via Ulithi to moor at San Pedro, California, 25 August 1945. =After hostilities= As part of the Magic Carpet fleet, she stood out from San Diego, California 11 September with rotation troops for Pearl Harbor and returned to San Francisco 24 September with 5,000 veterans. From 6 October 1945 to 8 February 1946, she made three round-trip trans- Pacific voyages (two out of San Francisco and the third from Seattle) to bring occupation troops to Yokohama. Following a Magic Carpet voyage to Manila and back to San Francisco 11 April 1946, the transport departed San Francisco 16 April for New York, arriving 1 May. Decommissioned there 10 May 1946, she was transferred to the War Department for peacetime operations as an Army transport and made shuttle runs with troops and supplies from San Francisco to garrisons in the Pacific until reacquired by the Navy 20 July 1950. General William Weigel was assigned to MSTS 1 August 1950, and redesignated USNS General William Weigel (T-AP-119). Korean War In this phase of her career, the ship sailed from the Pacific coast to Japan and Korea carrying troops for duty in the Korean War. She continued to rotate American troops to strengthen the United Nations position in Korea until she was placed in Reduced Operational Status in 1955. General William Weigel was returned to the Maritime Commission 12 June 1958 and entered the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Olympia, Washington. Vietnam War She was reacquired by the Navy 18 August 1965 and assigned to MSTS as the Navy bolstered its support forces for the Vietnam War. On 9 December 1965 she departed US Army Oakland California Terminal with elements of the 20th Engineer Battalion arriving at Cam Ranh Bay on 1 January 1966. She departed US Naval Base San Diego on 18 February 1966 with elements of 3rd Battalion, 1st Regiment, 3rd Marine Division, arriving at US Naval Base Pearl Harbor Hawaii on 5 March. The following day she was boarded by elements of the 25th Infantry Division at Pearl Harbor and departed on 6 March. USNS Weigel disembarked US Army troops at the port of Vũng Tàu on 12 March and two days later US Marines at Danang on 14 March 1966. In early August of 1966 she transported a replacement draft of U.S. Marines from San Diego, CA to Danang.M.E. Compton, member of replacement draft; On 28 September 1966 she departed the US Army Oakland California terminal carrying various units of the 54th Transportation Battalion including the 523rd Transportation Company. On 20 October 1966, elements of the 585th Transportation Group disembarked at Cam Ranh Bay. Three days later, on 23 October 1966, the 523rd Transportation Company disembarked in Qui Nhơn harbor. On 21 March 1967, Weigel landed the 6th Battalion, 32nd Artillery in Qui Nhơn. On her final voyage, Weigel departed US Army Oakland California Terminal on 3 October 1967 with elements of the 324th Signal Brigade and 3rd Battalion 506th Infantry, 101st Airborne Division, the 3rd Battalion (Abn) 503rd Infantry Regiment, 82d Airborne Division, reassigned to the 173rd Airborne Brigade and the 201st Aviation Company (Corps) out of Fort Bragg, NC to be located at Nha Trang, disembarking at Cam Ranh Bay on 26 October 1967. From there she made three more stops up the coast of Vietnam with her final stop being at Da Nang, where she moored in the harbor and disembarked by landing craft the US Army's 51st Civil Affairs Platoon of the 29th Civil Affairs Company, to be under the operational command of the 3rd Marine Amphibious Force. The eight men of the 51st Civil Affairs Platoon, the smallest tactical unit in the US Army at the time, were the last troops delivered to a war zone by Weigel in her long and far-ranging career as a troopship, with PFC Fred Jablonsky of New York City being the last to leave the ship. She carried troops to the Vietnam War from 1965 through 1967. The Weigel's final voyage may have actually begun on December 7, 1967, Pearl Harbor Day. Still a troop ship, she departed Pier 39 at Pearl Harbor around midnight, carrying almost half of the 11th Infantry Brigade soldiers to Vietnam. Colonel Oran K Henderson flew ahead with the advance party a week earlier and other half of unit had departed day earlier by another troop ship. She arrived in the Port of Qui Nhon on December 22, 1967, but since piers were all tied up, troops did not disembark until 11pm the next day. Once there, the troops disembarked the Weigel and they went to Phù Cát Air Base and flew on C-130s north to Đức Phổ Base Camp. Some elements then trucked up to Chu Lai and the Americal Division [23rd Infantry] was formed from the 11th, 196th and 198th light infantry brigades. The Weigel was used to ferry Korean troops to and from Vietnam in 1967 and the early part of 1968 before sailing to San Francisco. Final decommission General William Weigel was placed out of service and struck from the Naval Register on 31 March 1986. She was sold for scrapping on 10 April 1987 for $1,005,050, and scrapped in Taiwan later that year.

Beginnings In December 1911, the theatrical magazine Rampa published a note under the heading The Cinema in the Theatre (signed by V. Scânteie) indicating that \\"The Maestro Nottara is in the course of making a patriotic work re-creating the Romanian War of Independence on film, so that today's generations might learn the story of the battles of 1877, and for future generations a live tableau of Romanian bravery will remain\\". As a result, the director of the Bucharest branch of the Gaumont-Paris studio, Raymond Pellerin, announced the premiere of his film Războiul din 1877-1878 (The 1877-1878 War), scheduled for 29 December 1911. A \\"film\\" made in haste, with a troupe of second-hand actors and with the help of General Constantinescu, who commanded a division at Piteşti, from whom he had obtained the extras needed for the war scenes, \\"Războiul din 1877-1878\\" was screened a day before by the prefect of the capital's police, who decided that it did not correspond with historic fact. Consequently, the film was confiscated and destroyed, Raymond Pellerin was declared persona non grata and he left for Paris, while the \\"collaborationist\\" general saw himself moved to another garrison as a means of discipline. Production Plevna) On 5 May 1912, the magazine Flacăra (The Flame) brought to its readers' attention the fact that \\"as it is known, a few artists have founded a society with the goal of producing a film about the War of Independence... Such an undertaking deserves to be applauded\\". The initiators were a group of actors: C. Nottara, Aristide Demetriade, V. Toneanu, I. Brezeanu, N. Soreanu, P. Liciu, as well as the young Grigore Brezeanu, associate producer and the creative force behind the whole operation. Since a large amount of money was needed for the production, they also brought into this effort Leon Popescu, a wealthy man and owner of the Lyric Theatre. The group received strong backing from government authorities, with the army and all necessary equipment being placed at its disposal, plus military advisers (possibly including Pascal Vidraşcu). The cameras and their operators were brought from abroad, and the print was prepared in Parisian laboratories. Could Grigore Brezeanu have been the film's director? No source from that time gives credence to such a hypothesis. On the contrary, they present him as \\"initiator\\", producer of the film, beside members of the National Theatre and Leon Popescu. Furthermore, it appears that it was he who attracted the financier of the entire undertaking. In 1985, the film critic Tudor Caranfil discovered among Aristide Demetriade's papers his director's notebooks for Independenţa României, unequivocally confirming that he was the film's director. Thus, the film's production crew was as follows:CNcinema.abt.ro *Producers: Leon Popescu, Aristide Demetriade, Grigore Brezeanu, Constantin Nottara, Pascal Vidraşcu *Screenwriters: Petre Liciu, Constantin Nottara, Aristide Demetriade, Corneliu Moldoveanu. *Director: Aristide Demetriade *Cinematographer: Franck Daniau *Makeup and hairstylist: Pepi Machauer Plot The film depicts the events of the Russo- Turkish War (1877–1878), which led to independence for Romania. Premiere On 2 September 1912, at the Eforie cinema, the largest movie theatre in Bucharest, the premiere of Independenţa României took place. Despite all its shortcomings as the theatrical game of the actors, the errors of an army of extras uncontrolled by direction which provoked unintended laughter in some scenes and rendered dramatically limp those of the beginning, the film was well received by spectators, being shown for several weeks. Through this realization, through the dimensions of its theme, through the distribution method chosen, through the genuine artistic intentions, through its professional editing (for the time), the creation of this film can be considered Romania's first step in the art of cinematography. Aftermath And yet he who had realized this work, the man who kept the whole team together, the theatre director Grigore Brezeanu, was left disappointed. The press of the time made ostentatious mention of Leon Popescu, who financed the film and made sure to distance the other financiers, buying their part; no such praise was heaped on the artistic makers of the film. This caused producer Grigore Brezeanu to say in an interview given to the magazine \\"Rampa\\" and published on 13 April 1913: \\"My dream would have been to build a large film studio. I have come to believe that this is impossible. First of all, we are missing a large capital investment. Without money we cannot rival the foreign studios...A studio, according to our financiers, is something outside art, something in the realm of agriculture or the C.F.R. Hence I have abandoned this dream with great regret.\\" References Bibliography * Caranfil, Tudor, În căutarea filmului pierdut, Ed.

The Modern Kannada language has evolved in four phases over the years. From the Purva Halegannada in the 5th century (as per early epigraphic records), to the Halegannada (Old Kannada) between the 9th and 11th century, the Nadugannada (Middle Kannada) between the 12th and 17th century (as evidenced by Vachana literature), it has evolved to the present day Hosagannada (Modern Kannada) from 18th century to present. Hosagannada (Modern Kannada) is the official language of the state of Karnataka and is one of the 22 official national languages of the Republic of India and is the native language of approximately 65% of Karnataka's population. Etymology Halegannada is derived from two Kannada terms, haḷe and Kannaḍa. Haḷe, a prefix in Kannada language, means old or ancient. In Kannada grammar there are sandhis in which while pronouncing two words in combined form, the k becomes g (ādeśa sandhi) and so haḷe and Kannaḍa together becomes Haḷegannaḍa. Origin Purvada HaleGannada (Pre-old Kannada) A replica of the original Halmidi inscription at Halmidi village A 5th century copper coin was discovered at Banavasi with an inscription in the Kannada script, one of the oldest such coins ever discovered. In a report published by the Mysore Archaeological Department in 1936, Dr. M. H. Krishna, (the Director of Archaeology of the erstwhile Mysore state) who discovered the inscription in 1936 dated the inscription to 450 CE. This inscription in old-Kannada was found in Halmidi village near Hassan district. Many other inscriptions having Kannada words had been found like the Brahmagiri edict of 230 BCE by Ashoka. But this is the first full scale inscription in Kannada. Kannada was used in the inscriptions from the earliest times and the Halmidi inscription is considered to be the earliest epigraph written in Kannada. This inscription is generally known as the Halmidi inscription and consists of sixteen lines carved on a sandstone pillar. It has been dated to 450 CE and demonstrates that Kannada was used as a language of administration at that time.K.V. Ramesh, Chalukyas of Vatapi, 1984, Agam Kala Prakashan, Delhi p10 Dr K.V.Ramesh has hypothesized that, compared to possibly contemporaneous Sanskrit inscriptions, \\"Halmidi inscription has letters which are unsettled and uncultivated, no doubt giving an impression, or rather an illusion, even to the trained eye, that it is, in date, later than the period to which it really belongs, namely the fifth century A.D.\\" The original inscription is kept in the Office of the Director of Archaeology and Museums, Govt. of Karnataka, Mysore, and a fibreglass replica has been installed in Halmidi. A mantapa to house a fibreglass replica of the original inscription has been built at Hamidi village. The Government has begun to promote the village as a place of historical interest. Evidence from edicts during the time of Ashoka the Great suggests that the Kannada script and its literature were influenced by Buddhist literature. The Halmidi inscription, the earliest attested full- length inscription in the Kannada language and script, is dated to 450 CE while the earliest available literary work, the Kavirajamarga, has been dated to 850 CE. References made in the Kavirajamarga, however, prove that Kannada literature flourished in the Chattana, Beddande and Melvadu metres during earlier centuries.Narasimhacharya (1988), pp. 12, 17. The 5th century Tamatekallu inscription of Chitradurga, and the Chikkamagaluru inscription of 500 CE are further examples.Narasimhacharya (1988), p6Rice (1921), p13Govinda Pai in Bhat (1993), p102 Purvahalegannada grammar The grammar of the ancient Kannada language was in general more complex than of modern Kannada which has some similarities of old Tamil. Phonology wise, there was full use of the now obsolete letters ೞ and ಱ (i.e. same as in Tamil and Malayalam). Aspirated letters were not normally used, as there was less an influence from Sanskrit. Words (nouns and verbs etc.) were permitted to end in consonants, the permitted consonants being: ನ್ ಣ್ ಲ್ ಳ್ ೞ್ ರ್ ಱ್ ಯ್ ಮ್. If words were borrowed from Sanskrit, they were changed to fit the tongue and style of the Kannada language. Most words were Dravidian in origin. Nouns declined according to how they ended (i.e. which type of vowel or consonant). They were grouped into human and non-human (animate and inanimate). Examples of terminations of declension are: ಮ್, ಅನ್, ಅಳ್, ಅರ್, ಒನ್, ಒರ್, ಗಳ್, ಗೆ, ಅತ್ತಣಿಂ, ಇನ್, ಇಂದೆ, ಅಲ್, ಉಳ್ and ಒಳ್. Most terminations were suffixed to the 'oblique case' of nouns. The plurals of human and non-human nouns differed; non-human nouns took the suffix ಗಳ್ whilst human nouns took the suffix ಅರ್. These two suffixes had tens and tens of varied forms. Occasionally, with human nouns and nouns normally taking only ಅರ್, double plurals were formed using both the suffixes e.g. ಜನ (person) + ಅರ್ + ಕಳ್ = ಜನರ್ಗಳ್ (people). There was a large variety of personal pronouns. The first-person plural had a clusivity distinction, i.e. ನಾಂ - We (including person being talked to); ಎಂ - We (excluding person being talked to). There were three degrees of proximity distinction, usually shown by the three vowels: ಇ - proximate space; ಉ - intermediate space; ಅ - distant space. Numbers and natural adjectives (i.e. true adjectives) were often compounded with nouns, in their ancient, crude forms. Examples of these crude forms are: One - ಒರ್, ಓರ್; Two - ಇರ್, ಈರ್; Big - ಪೇರ್; Cold - ತಣ್. Examples of compounds are: ಓರಾನೆ - One elephant, ಇರ್ಮೆ - Two times/Twice, ಪೇರ್ಮರಂ - large tree, ತಣ್ಣೀರ್ - cold water As of verbs, there was a large variety of native Kannada verbs. These verbs existed as verbal roots, which could be modified into conjugations, nouns etc. Many verbs existed which are now out of use. e.g. ಈ - To give; ಪೋರ್ - To fight; ಉಳ್ - To be, To possess. Verbs were conjugated in the past and future. The present tense was a compound tense, and was artificial (i.e., it wasn't in the language originally); it was made using forms of the verb ಆಗು/ಆ (= to become). There was a negative mood (e.g. from ಕೇಳ್ - To listen, ಕೇಳೆನ್ = I do not listen, I have not listened, I won't listen). Note that the negative mood is devoid of time aspect, and could and can be used with a past, present, or future meaning. Apart from the negative mood, all tenses were formed using personal terminations attached to participles of verbs. Causative verbs were formed using ಚು, ಸು, ಇಚು, ಇಸು, ಪು, (ದು - obsolete, only present in very ancient forms). The first two and last were originally used only in the past tenses, the middle two in the non-past (i.e. present), and the penultimate one in the future. This reflects the Dravidian linguistic trait of causativity combined with time aspect. This trait was eventually lost. Appellative verbs also existed, which were nouns used as verbs by suffixing personal terminations, e.g. ಅರಸನ್ (king) + ಎನ್ (personal termination for 'I') = ಅರಸನೆನ್ (I am the king) Nouns were formed from verbal roots using suffixes and these nouns were usually neuter gender and abstract in meaning, e.g. suffixes ಕೆ, ಗೆ, ವು, ವಿ, ಪು, ಪಿ, ಮೆ, ಅಲ್; Root ಕಲ್ (To learn) + ಪಿ (Suffix) = ಕಲ್ಪಿ (Knowledge, learning) Also, negative nouns could be formed from negative verb- bases e.g. ಅಱಿಯ (Negative base of root ಅಱಿ, inferred meaning not-knowing, Literally: Yet-to-know) + ಮೆ (suffix) = ಅಱಿಯಮೆ (Lack of knowledge, Ignorance, Literally: Yet-to-know-ness) Regarding adjectives, Kannada had and still has a few native words that can be classed as true adjectives. Apart from these, mentioned in 'Numbers and natural adjectives', Kannada used and uses the genitive of nouns and verbal derivatives as adjectives. e.g. ಚಿಕ್ಕದ ಕೂಸು - Small baby (literally: baby of smallness). It may be said that there are not real 'adjectives' in Kannada, as these can be called moreover, nouns of quality. Halmidi textual analysis The replica of the Halmidi inscription mounted on a pedestal The inscription is in verse form indicating the authors of the inscription had a good sense of the language structure. The inscription is written in pre-old Kannada (Purvada-halegannada), which later evolved into old Kannada (Halegannada), middle Kannada and eventually modern Kannada.M.

More than 800 inscriptions are found at Shravanabelagola dating from various points during the period from 600 to 1830 CE. A large number of these are found at Chandragiri, and the rest can be seen at Indragiri. Most of the inscriptions at Chandragiri date back to before the 10th century. The inscriptions include text in the Kannada, Sanskrit, Tamil, Marathi, Marwari and Mahajani languages. The second volume of Epigraphia Carnatica, written by Benjamin L. Rice is dedicated to the inscriptions found here. The inscriptions that are scattered around the area of Shravanabelagola are in various Halegannada (Old Kannada) and Purvadahalegannada (Pre-Old Kannada) characters. Some of these inscriptions mention the rise to power of the Gangas, Rashtrakutas, Hoysalas, Vijayanagar empire and Mysore Wodeyars. These inscriptions have immensely helped modern scholars in properly understanding the nature, growth and development of the Kannada language and its literature. Old Kannada inscription at the base of Gomateshwara monolith in Shravanabelagola (981 CE. Western Ganga Dynasty) The earliest full-length Kannada copper plates in Old Kannada script (early 8th century) belongs to the Alupa King Aluvarasa II from Belmannu, South Kanara district and displays the double crested fish, his royal emblem.Gururaj Bhat in Kamath (2001), p97 The oldest well-preserved palm leaf manuscript is in Old Kannada and is that of Dhavala, dated to around the 9th century, preserved in the Jain Bhandar, Mudbidri, Dakshina Kannada district.[26] The manuscript contains 1478 leaves written using ink. The written Kannada language has come under various religious and social influences in its 1600 years of known existence. Linguists generally divide the written form into four broad phases. From the 9th to the 14th centuries, Kannada works were classified under Old Kannada (Halegannada). In this period Kannada showed a high level of maturity as a language of original literature.The earliest cultivators of Kannada literature were Jain scholars (Narasimhacharya 1988, p17) Mostly Jain and Saivite poets produced works in this period. This period saw the growth of Jain puranas and Virashaiva Vachana Sahitya or simply vachana, a unique and native form of literature which was the summary of contributions from all sections of society.More than two hundred contemporary Vachana poets have been recorded (Narasimhacharya 1988, p20)Sastri (1955), p361 Early Brahminical works also emerged from the 11th century.Durgasimha, who wrote the Panchatantra, and Chandraraja, who wrote the Madanakatilaka, were early Brahmin writers in the eleventh century under Western Chalukya King Jayasimha II (Narasimhacharya 1988, p19) By the 10th century, Kannada had seen its greatest poets, such as Pampa, Sri Ponna and Ranna, and its great prose writings such as the Vaddaradhane of Shivakotiacharya, indicating that a considerable volume of classical prose and poetry in Kannada had come into existence a few centuries before Kavirajamarga (c.850).Sastri (1955), p355 Among existing landmarks in Kannada grammar, Nagavarma II's Karnataka-bhashabhushana (1145) and Kesiraja's Shabdamanidarpana (1260) are the oldest.Sastri (1955), p359Narasimhacharya (1988), p19 Epigraphia Carnatica by B.L.Rice published by the Mysore Archeology department in 12 volumes contains a study of inscriptions from 3rd century until the 19th century. These inscriptions belonged to different dynasties that ruled this region such as Kadambas, Western Chalukyas, Hoysalas, Vijayanagar kings, Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan and the Mysore Wodeyars. The inscriptions found were mainly written in Kannada language but some have been found to be written in languages like Tamil, Sanskrit, Telugu, Urdu and even Persian and have been preserved digitally as a CD-ROM in 2005. Information Dissemination on Halegannada Linguist Lingadevaru Halemane announcing the launching of the lecture series in Bangalore in June 2007 on Halegannada, noted that there was documentary proof about Kannada being existent even in 250 BCE, and that there were enough grounds for giving classical status to Kannada. The lecture series unveiled the indigenous wealth of the language, the stone inscriptions belonging to different periods, besides the folk and medicinal knowledge people possessed in this region in that age. This series of lectures would be extended to other parts of the state. The central Government of India formed a new category of languages called Classical languages, in 2004. Tamil was the first to be classified so. Sanskrit was added to the category a year later. The four criteria to declare Kannada as a Classical language, stated below, which are stated to be fulfilled has prompted action to seek recognition from the Central Institute of Indian Languages # Recorded history of over a thousand five hundred years # High antiquity of a language's early texts # An body of ancient literature, which is considered a valuable heritage by generation of speakers # The literary tradition has to be original and not borrowed from another speech community and the language could be distinct from its \\"later and current\\" forms or it could be continuous. The classical tag equates a language to all ancient languages of the world. This is a qualification that helps in the establishment of its research and teaching chairs in any university in the world. It also provides a larger spectrum for its study and research, creates a large number of young researchers and ensures republication of out-of-print classic literature. An Expert Committee comprising eminent researchers, distinguished academicians, reputed scholars, well known historians and renowned linguists prepared a report by collecting all the documents and credentials to prove the claim of its antiquity. This document was submitted to the Committee of Linguistic Experts set up in November 2004 by the Government of India for recognition of Kannada as a classical language. The Expert Committee Report of the Government of Karnataka titled \\"Experts Report submitted to the Government of Karnataka on the subject of the recognition of Kannada as a classical Language\\" published in February 2007 by Kannada Pustaka Pradhikara of The Department of Kannada and Culture, Government of Karnataka, M.S.

JSM had offices in Hong Kong, where it was one of the leading law firms, and in Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai on mainland China, as well as in Bangkok, Thailand and Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Before the combination, the firm had a team of 800 staff, including more than 260 lawyers. According to the firm, JSM was one of the top three foreign law firms in Thailand and Vietnam. On September 1, 2018, the firm changed its name in Asia to Mayer Brown. History Johnson Stokes & Master was established in 1863 in Hong Kong by Edmund Sharp as a sole proprietorship at a time when Hong Kong had less than a dozen practising lawyers. Later, an office in Shanghai, China was set up in 1893. In 1895, Alfred Bulmer Johnson became senior partner of the firm with Alfred Stokes and Godfrey Master as supporting partners. At that time, JSM was already legal advisor to The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, a major commercial establishment in Hong Kong. On December 1, 1896, Johnson retired from private practice at the firm and also resigned his position of Crown Solicitor which he had held from 1882. On this occasion, the succession of the Crown Solicitor-ship was passed not to the firm's next in command - Stokes who was in Shanghai, China running the local branch of the firm - but to the next most senior solicitor in the Colony, Henry Lardner Dennys. In July 1897, JSM engaged the firm's first local born solicitor - the Oxford- educated Wei Wah-on, son of a compradore of the Chartered Mercantile Bank. In 1936, JSM moved into the air-conditioned offices of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Building. After the Second World War, JSM resumed business in the Bank Building though Hong Kong was in a sorry state at that time.

Life He studied at different universities (Salamanca, Montpellier, Bologna, etc.) and entered the Dominican Order in 1452 at Eichstätt, Bavaria. After his religious profession he took up philosophy and theology at Leipzig, where he also produced his first literary work De modo praedicandi (1457). In 1459 he defended publicly in Freiburg a series of theses so successfully that the provincial chapter then in session there sent him to the University of Bologna for advanced courses in theology and canon law. Recalled after two years, he was made lector of theology and engaged in teaching and preaching. In 1465 he taught philosophy and was regent of studies in Cologne; in 1467 taught theology at Ulm; in 1469 or 1470 was elected prior in Eichstätt, on 31 May 1473, the newly founded University of Ingolstadt conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Theology; in 1474 he taught theology in the convent at Ratisbon and in 1478 became professor of Old Testament exegesis in the University of Ingolstadt. Shortly after, on the invitation of the patron of learning, Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, he became rector of his newly erected Academy of Philosophy, Theology, and Sacred Scripture at Buda, in gratitude for which Nigri dedicated to the king his Clypeus Thomistarum adversus omnes doctrinae doctoris angelici obtrectatores (Venice, 1481), in which he defends the teaching of Thomas Aquinas against the Scotists and Nominalists. Works Hebrew alphabet. From Peter Niger's Stern des Meschiah, 1477, 1646 Niger was an eminent theologian and preacher, and an orthodox disciple of Aquinas. In his theological works he mainly limits himself to the discussion of questions of logic and psychology. He devoted most of his time to preaching to the Jews. He had learned their language and become familiar with their literature at Salamanca and Montpellier by associating with Jewish children and attending the lectures of the rabbis. At Ratisbon, Worms, and Frankfort-on-the-Main he preached in German, Latin, and Hebrew, frequently challenging the rabbis to a disputation. He wrote two anti-Semitic works, one in Latin, Tractatus contra Perfidos Judaeos (Esslingen, 1475), in which he severely attacked the Jews and the Talmud. The other, written in German, is entitled Stern des Messias (star of the Messiah)(Esslingen, 1477). Reuchlin in his Augenspiegel declared them absurd. Both works have appendices giving the Hebrew alphabet in Hebrew and Latin type, rules of grammar and for reading Hebrew, the Decalogue in Hebrew, and some Messianic texts from the Old Testament. They are among the earliest specimens of Hebrew printing in Germany, and the first attempt at Hebrew grammar in that country by a Christian scholar. They were later published separately as Commentatio de primis linguae Hebraicae elementis (Altdorf, 1764). Peter Teuto, O. P. (Quétif, I, 855) and Peter Eystettensis (Eck, \\"Chrysopassus Cent.\\", XLIX) are most probably to be identified with this Peter Nigri. References *Quétif-Échard, SS. Ord.

The album was produced by Mike Thorne and released on his own label, The Stereo Society. The record company made a mistake with the track listing: they intended to change the sequence of the tracks and updated the art work to reflect the new song order, but neglected to change the running order on the disc itself. Reception Writing for Allmusic, critic Dave Thompson said the Shadows and Dust was \\"the album that Lovich should have made in 1980\\", stating that it would have been a much better follow-up to 1979's Flex than the albums that actually followed. Time Out New York said that the album \\"reveals Lovich to be as gleefully off-kilter as ever. The album is a brilliantly giddy crush of goofy goth and rubbery funk. Alt.Culture.Guide said that the album was \\"armed with sequencers, a deepened sense of theater and one or two block-rockin beats\\". The Harp review found the first few tracks \\"ponderous\\" but liked the later tracks, saying that the track \\"Insect Eater\\" \\"really scorches the rocket cottage with Lovich's repeated shrieks of \\"Earwigs in my bed at midnight!\\" underlined with luscious keyboard burbles\\". The reviewer for the Charleston Gazette said the album is \\"shocking in that Lovich seems not to have missed a beat.

C. Breckinridge (AP-176) was a troopship that served with the United States Navy in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. In October 1949 she was redesignated T-AP-176 but retained her Navy crew. Her namesake was United States Marine Corps Lieutenant General James Carson Breckinridge (1877-1942), who was the grandson of John Cabell Breckinridge, who served as Vice President of the United States from 1857 to 1861. USS General J. C. Breckinridge, a General John Pope class troop transport, was built under Maritime Commission contract by the Federal Shipbuilding & Drydock Company at Kearny, New Jersey. World War II She was commissioned with a United States Coast Guard crew in June 1945 and was en route to Marseille on her first operational voyage when the surrender of Japan ended World War II. Peacetime service The transport made four more voyages to France to bring troops home, then was transferred to the Pacific, arriving at San Francisco in January 1946. A Navy crew replaced her Coast Guard crew there in February, probably after she was selected as one of six ships of her class to be retained in the postwar commissioned fleet. Following five trans-Pacific voyages, between October 1946 and January 1947 General J. C. Breckinridge was then converted at Philadelphia for peacetime employment, with special facilities for military dependents. She retained her armament but lost some of her lifeboats. Breckinridge then returned to the Pacific where she maintained a busy schedule of voyages between the west coast of the United States and numerous points in the Western Pacific. In April 1948, the ship destroyed two floating mines in the San Francisco-Hawaii shipping lanes with gunfire, one 990 miles off the coast and the other 545 miles. They were among more than a dozen sighted recently off the Pacific coast and were thought to be remnants of Japanese mine fields torn loose by storms in the Aleutians.Associated Press, “Floating Mines Found in Path of S.F.-Hawaii Ships,” The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Wednesday 21 April 1948, Volume LIV, Number 201, page 3. In October 1949 all the ships in the Naval Transportation Service were reassigned to the newly created Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS). As a ship, operationally subordinate to MSTS she was redesignated T-AP-176, but because she was a commissioned vessel with a Navy, not civilian, crew, General J. C. Breckinridge retained the designation \\"USS\\" instead of becoming \\"USNS.\\" Korean War In July 1950, immediately after the outbreak of the Korean War, General J. C. Breckinridge was reconverted to a troop transport at San Francisco and in August carried troops from Seattle to Yokosuka, Japan. She was diverted from her return voyage to support the assault on Inchon, where she arrived with fresh troops the day after the landing. In early November 1950 she sailed from Ft. Mason near San Francisco to Moji, Japan carrying about 3000 ground personnel of the 452nd USAFR Bomb Wing and later in that month assisted in the evacuation of Wonsan, and in December she helped evacuate Hungnam. General J. C. Breckinridge made two more troop voyages in the war in Korea and then returned to regular MSTS transport duty, carrying both military and civilian passengers throughout the Pacific area. In 1955 she was again modified, losing her armament and receiving additional lifeboats. She remained an active part of the MSTS nucleus fleet as one of its few commissioned ships until December 1965, when she was inactivated and turned over to the Maritime Administration for layup in its reserve fleet. From 1958 to 1959, Breckinridge was commanded by five time Navy Cross recipient Captain Roy M. Davenport. Davenport earned the decorations as a submarine commander during World War II and was the first person and the only sailor to receive five Navy Crosses. Vietnam War Breckinridge played a small role in the Vietnam War in 1965 and received a service star for her service there. She landed troops off the coast of Vung Tau in Vietnam in May 1965. In June 1965 she landed troops at Cam Ranh Bay, Nha Trang and Qui Nhon.Oral History Interview from Lee Lewandowski who spoke from personal experience. Breckenridge also made at least one other voyage to South Vietnam in 1965, dropping off troops at Cam Ranh Bay and Qui Nhon (and perhaps other ports) from 11–17 September. Point of departure was Oakland, California, on or about 10 August. Decommission General J. C. Breckinridge was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and permanently transferred to the Maritime Administration in December 1966. The Maritime Administration sold her in August 1987 to a Japanese firm for scrapping. Awards General J. C.

The HRC enforces City Ordinances and policies on nondiscrimination and promotes social and economic progress for all.  History  In 1963, the modern day civil rights movement manifested in San Francisco through demonstrations against hotels, supermarkets, drive-in restaurants, automobile showrooms and automobile repair shops which were discriminating against African Americans. In early 1964, Mayor John Shelley appointed an Interim Committee on Human Relations, which subsequently recommended to the Board of Supervisors that a permanent Human Rights Commission be established. In July 1964, the Board of Supervisors passed the recommendation, and Mayor Shelley signed an ordinance establishing the Human Rights Commission. From 1964, the Human Rights Commission grew in response to City government's mandate to address the causes of and problems resulting from prejudice, intolerance, bigotry and discrimination. The Mayor and the Board of Supervisors gave the Human Rights Commission more and broader powers and duties to address these problems, and passed additional ordinances, which were implemented by the Human Rights Commission. In June 1990, the voters of San Francisco established the Human Rights Commission as a Charter Commission (see Section 3.699-5 of the Charter).  General information  The San Francisco Human Rights Commission (HRC) is a department of the City and County of San Francisco [and County of San Francisco] that works to increase equality, eradicate discrimination, and to protect human rights for all people. The HRC enforces City Ordinances and policies on nondiscrimination and promotes social and economic progress for all. Some of the HRC's core focuses include: *Discrimination Complaints: Studying, investigating, and mediating incidents of discrimination, including intergroup tensions. *Equal Benefits: Working to increase equality for employees in Domestic Partnerships and prevent discrimination in City contracting. *Local Business Enterprise: Promoting the utilization of local businesses in City contracting, helping build small businesses in the City's underserved and marginalized neighborhoods. *LGBT: Advocating for and assisting the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender communities with issues of discrimination. *Equity Advisory Committee: Advises the Commission on quality of life issues such as homelessness, environmental justice, immigration, healthcare, and other matters affecting people's lives in San Francisco. The HRC also works in other human rights issues, such as combating human trafficking, hate crimes, and bullying. For more information, please visit the HRC website.  About the Human Rights Commission's advisory committees  Advisory committees are an integral and vitally important component of the HRC, providing for community involvement and opportunity for in-depth study and exploration of issues. The Chair of the Commission assigns Commissioners and appoints members from the community to participate in these committees. The HRC currently maintains three advisory committees: the Equity Advisory Committee; the Local Business Enterprise Committee and the Lesbian Gay Bisexual & Transgender Advisory Committee. The Executive Director is Theresa Sparks.  Current initiatives  HRC staff are currently working on a range of human rights policy issues all of which can be found on the HRC's website. A snapshot of these issues include: *Creation of a Youth Anti-Bullying Training Module: The HRC is working with Assemblyperson Tom Ammiano's Office to replicate his anti- bullying legislation (also known as Seth’s Law), in order to create a youth sensitivity training module for City Departments, Agents and Contractors working with youth. *Hate Crimes Prevention: The HRC staffs the Coalition Against Hate Violence, which is composed of various nongovernmental and government agencies, who work together to prevent hate violence and to protect individuals who have been subjected to hate violence. *Combating Human Trafficking in San Francisco: The HRC staffs the San Francisco Collaborative Against Human Trafficking (SFCAHT), which is composed of over 25 agencies, all of which are committed to ending human trafficking in San Francisco. SFCAHT's goals consists of: increasing the general public's awareness about human trafficking; broadening the scope of current outreach efforts to inform survivors of human trafficking of the resources and services available to them; and to collect data about human trafficking in San Francisco in order to build the base of information about the true scope and impact of human trafficking citywide. *Sanctuary City Ordinance Enforcement: According to the Sanctuary City Ordinance, City Departments, Commissions or City employees may not help Immigration and Customs Enforcement with immigration investigations or arrests unless such help is required by federal or state law or a warrant. The HRC enforces the Sanctuary City Ordinance and HRC staff assist the public with filing, mediating, and investigating complaints of non-compliance of the SCO. *Comprehensive Health Care for the Transgender Community: The HRC is working with Assemblyperson Tom Ammiano, the State Department of Managed Health Care and the Transgender Law Center to extend comprehensive healthcare benefits to the transgender community.

Waterhouse c. 1890 Frederick George Waterhouse (25 August 1815 – 7 September 1898) was an English naturalist, zoologist and entomologist who made significant contributions to the study of the natural history of Australia. Waterhouse was born near London, a son of solicitor J. W. Waterhouse. He was a keen naturalist and worked with his elder brother George Robert Waterhouse at the British Museum (Natural History). On 7 July 1852 he married Fanny Shepherd Abbott (c. 1831 – 7 August 1875), and soon after they sailed for South Australia in the Sydney, the first steamer to make the voyage. Together they had five sons and one daughter. His original intention was to prospect for gold at the Victorian diggings, but he was unsuccessful and found employment with C. T. Hargrave, surveying in the Mount Lofty Ranges and Kangaroo Island. In 1860 he became curator of the South Australian Institute Museum, which opened in 1862, and which he had helped to found in 1856 with the donation of his own valuable entomological and ornithological collection. He was a corresponding member of the Zoological Society of London. He joined the John McDouall Stuart Expedition 1861–1862, returning to Adelaide in 1863 with bird and mammal skins, insects and plants, including specimens of the Princess Alexandra parrot, Polytelis alexandrae. In 1872, trawling in the Gulf St Vincent with Albert Molineux, secretary of the Agricultural Bureau, he caught forty species of fish which had not been found there previously, some of which were new to science, and were described by François Louis de la Porte, comte de Castelnau then in Melbourne. In 1882 he took eight months' leave of absence on account of ill-health, travelled to England, and on his return retired to his home \\"Wandeen\\" in Burnside. His replacement at the Museum, William Haacke, made his name there by proving that echidnas were oviparous, but resigned after a series of disputes with the Board and Director. In 1897 he moved to Jamestown to live with his son, Edward George Waterhouse (c. 1860 – 25 January 1947). He died on 7 September 1898, aged 83 years, at Mannahill (between Peterborough and Broken Hill), where Edward, a mounted constable, had been transferred.

Early life Louis Strange was born in Tarrant Keyneston, Dorset, and was educated at St Edward's School, Oxford, joining the school's contingent of the Dorset Yeomanry. Strange spent his childhood at Tarrant Keynstone Mill on the River Stour. His family farmed at Spetisbury in Dorset. He had seen military aircraft and the airship Beta flying over Dorset during the summer manoeuvres of 1912 when serving with the Dorsetshire Yeomanry and determined in May 1913 to become a pilot. He joined the Ewen School of flying at Hendon Aerodrome in July and gained his Royal Aero Club Aviators' Certificate, No. 575, on 5 August. On 8 October 1913 he was commissioned as a second lieutenant (on probation) in the Royal Flying Corps (Special Reserve). Just after obtaining his licence he won his first cross-country race and then won the Hendon March Meeting race, beating his old instructor into second place. In the latter part of 1913 and early 1914, Strange flew many hours from Hendon, instructing trainee pilots. On 4 April 1914 he appeared in Flight magazine as one of five pilots who had recently joined the \\"Upside Down Club\\" by performing a loop. RFC service His posting to the sixth course of instruction at the RFC's Central Flying School at Upavon, Wiltshire, came in May 1914. There he was retrained to fly B.E.2b and B.E.8 military aircraft. On 20 June he took part in a Hendon–Birmingham–Manchester and return air race at the controls of an Gnome powered Bleriot monoplane, being first to arrive at Trafford Park Aerodrome, Manchester, where the Lord Mayor greeted him. To reach Strange's hand, the man stood on a bracing wire to the landing gear, damaging it. On take-off to return south, the wire snapped, smashing the Bleriot's propellor and the machine was damaged, putting him out of the race. On 30 July 1914 Strange was formally commissioned for service in the Regular Army as a second lieutenant in the Dorsetshire Regiment, but remained on attachment to the Royal Flying Corps, in which he was appointed a flying officer the same day. In August 1914 he was despatched to join his first operational unit, No. 5 Squadron RFC, based at Gosport, Hampshire. On 15/16 August – despite severe weather and a damaged longeron – he flew his Farman aircraft via Dover and over the English Channel to Amiens and then to the unit's new base at Maubeuge, France, being the last of the squadron to arrive. Aerial combat and bombing pioneer Strange soon adapted his Farman to carry a Lewis machine gun, improvising a mounting to the top of the observer's nacelle. His first armed encounter with the enemy came on 22 August when six enemy aircraft appeared at 5,000 feet over the airfield at Maubeuge. He took off in his Farman with Lieutenant L. Penn-Gaskell as gunner in the front cockpit to intercept the patrolling Germans, but with inconclusive results as the laden aircraft would not climb above . The next few days saw a general Allied retreat and the squadron had to move base several times, whilst Strange and his fellow pilots continued their observation and light bombing sorties. Less than two weeks after arriving in France Strange's inventive brain designed home-made petrol bombs that on 28 August he and his observer dropped by hand from their Henry Farman biplane onto the convoys of German troops and transport north of St. Quentin; the results \\"sent us home very well pleased with ourselves\\". In October 1914 Strange invented a safety strap allowing the observer of his Avro 504 to \\"stand up and fire all round over top of plane and behind\\". He also designed and fitted a machine gun mounting to the 504, consisting of a crossbar between the central struts over which was slung a rope, allowing the Lewis to be pulled up into a position from which the observer, seating in the front cockpit, could fire backwards over Strange's head. On 22 November 1914 it was with this arrangement that Strange claimed his first victory; with Lieutenant F. Small as gunner, he attacked an Aviatik two-seater and forced it down from over Armentières to make a bumpy landing in a ploughed field just behind the British lines. On 25 December 1914 Strange flew to the German-held airfield at Lille and, as a Christmas day prank, bombed it with footballs. Strange next turned his talents to developing a bomb chute with Lieutenant Euan Rabagliati. Attempting to drop 7-pound shrapnel bombs through a steel tube set in the floor of the Avro 504, one bomb jammed in the tube and prompted a forced landing through a field of corn, which luckily ripped the detonator from the jammed bomb. On 16 February 1915 he was appointed a flight commander with the acting rank of captain, and posted to No. 6 Squadron. On 10 March, the first day of the battle of Neuve Chapelle, Strange carried out one of the first tactical bombing missions of the war. He had modified his B.E.2c to carry four bombs on wing racks which could be released by pulling a cable fitted in the cockpit. He dropped these bombs on Courtrai railway station, from a height of no more than , causing 75 casualties and closing the station for three days. Subsequently, on 27 March, he was awarded the Military Cross, which he received from the King at Buckingham Palace on 9 December 1915. While with No. 6 Squadron, Strange was a compatriot of Captain Lanoe Hawker. The squadron became pioneers of many aspects in military aviation at the time, driven largely by the imagination of Strange and the engineering talents of Hawker. Their talents led to various mountings for Lewis machine guns, one of which won Hawker the Victoria Cross, and one that nearly cost Strange his life. Having equipped his Martinsyde S.1 scout with a Lewis gun mounted on the top wing above the cockpit, on 10 May 1915 Strange sought out the enemy to try out the new arrangement and attacked a German Aviatik two-seater. In order to change the empty drum on the Lewis, Strange had to stand up in the cockpit. Immediately the machine flipped on its back, throwing Strange from the cockpit and developing a flat spin downwards. Strange, hanging onto the ammunition drum of the Lewis gun, managed to swing back into the cockpit and kick the stick over to right the aircraft only 500 feet above the ground. Strange later related: :I kept on kicking upwards behind me until at last I got one foot and then the other hooked inside the cockpit. Somehow I got the stick between my legs again, and jammed on full aileron and elevator; I do not know exactly what happened then, but the trick was done. The machine came over the right way up, and I fell off the top plane and into my seat with a bump. He safely returned to base, but was criticised by his CO for \\"causing unnecessary damage\\" to his instrument panel and seat in his efforts to regain the cockpit. The squadron's log book simply noted: \\"the squadron was fortunate in its personnel.\\" On 21 September 1915 Louis Strange was appointed to form and command No. 23 Squadron RFC at Gosport, Hampshire. As a squadron commander he held the acting-rank of major, to which he was appointed on 5 November, the day he married his wife, Marjorie. Due to appendicitis Strange handed over command in March 1916. Strange then established No. 1 School of Air Gunnery at Hythe in Kent, with the acting-rank of lieutenant-colonel, and formed No. 2 School of Air Gunnery at Turnberry. On 1 April 1917 he became Assistant Commandant at the Central Flying School, graded as a wing commander and retaining his acting rank. On 26 June 1918 Strange was selected to command the newly formed 80th Wing. During the next five months he was to be awarded both the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Distinguished Service Order. His wing of Sopwith Camels, S.E.5s, DH.9s and Bristol Fighters launched massed raids on the enemy airfields, reducing the effectiveness of German aerial response. Between 1 July and 11 November the seven squadrons under Strange's command (including Nos. 88, 92, 103, 2 AFC & 4 AFC) – the latter two of which were from the Australian Flying Corps – destroyed or drove 'down out of control' some 449 German aircraft, as well as 23 balloons. On 24 September 1918 Louis' younger brother Gilbert John Strange, a 7-kill ace and a captain in No. 40 Squadron, was killed in action. Between the wars On 1 August 1919 Strange was granted a permanent commission in the Royal Air Force with the rank of major, resigning his commission in the Dorsetshire Regiment the same day. On 1 November 1919 he was promoted from squadron leader to wing commander. Strange retired from the service through ill health (sciatica) on 24 February 1921. He bought of farmland at Worth Matravers on the Isle of Purbeck, and worked them over the next seven years, helping to restore his health. Strange operated a dairy farm with his brother Jack Ronald Stuart Strange, but the partnership was dissolved by mutual consent on 15 October 1928 with Jack Strange taking over the business. By the late 1920s Strange had become a director and chief pilot of Simmonds Aircraft Limited and remained a director when it became the Spartan Aircraft Company. He was also a director of the Whitney Straight Corporation. Strange flew company aircraft in several competitions, including the Simmonds Spartan G-AAGN in the 1929 King's Cup Air Race, and the Simmonds Spartan G-AAMG in a handicap race from Woodley to Hanworth and back, at the Reading Air Fete in June 1930, coming 2nd with an average speed of . RAF service in World War II Too old for a regular commission, on 18 April 1940 Strange returned to military service as a 50-year-old pilot officer in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. He was posted to No. 24 Squadron, the RAF's only transport and communications services squadron at that time. On 21 May 1940 Strange arrived in Merville in northern France as No. 24 Squadron's Aerodrome Control Officer. The airfield had been evacuated by the RAF fighter squadron stationed there and No. 24 Squadron were tasked with saving what aircraft and equipment they could. Two fighters were patched up and flown back to England. All remaining Hurricanes had been cannibalised, leaving one in flying condition. With no pilot available, Strange took off in an aircraft type he had never flown before, unarmed, and with most of the instruments missing. Anti-aircraft fire forced Strange up to and the lone fighter was then attacked by several Bf 109s. Surprised by the sound of machine-gun fire, Strange dived the Hurricane to tree-top height and successfully escaped. A month later he was awarded a bar to his Distinguished Flying Cross. On 21 June 1940, Squadron Leader Strange was appointed commanding officer of the newly created Central Landing School (CLS) at RAF Ringway near Manchester. This unit was charged with the initiation, development and organisation of the UK's sole parachute training facility, and which later pioneered the parachute training curriculum of the Allied airborne forces. The unit was later redesignated No.1 Parachute Training School RAF (PTS). Using the techniques developed under Strange, the PTS trained over 60,000 Allied personnel and paratroopers at Ringway between 1940 and 1946. On 5 May 1941, the Merchant Ship Fighter Unit (MSFU) was established at RAF Speke near Liverpool, and Strange was appointed as commanding officer. The MSFU was charged with the development of the CAM ship for the catapult-launching of Hurricanes for convoy defence. A catapult for training volunteer pilots was erected at the airfield. With insufficient aircraft carriers available, there was the so-called \\"Air Gap\\" within which merchant shipping was out of reach of land-based aircraft on both sides of the Atlantic. As the predatory Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condors could therefore operate with impunity, fighters launched by catapult from merchant ships were felt to be a potentially effective response. About 50 Hurricane Mk.Is were modified by General Aircraft for catapult launch and 35 merchantmen were configured to carry catapults, with the first Atlantic crossings in April 1941. The Catapult Aircraft Merchantmen (CAM) and their so-called \\"Hurricats\\" soon proved their worth: Seven Condors were destroyed through 1941–43, while the deterrent effect was even more important. In September 1941 he was posted as Commanding Officer, RAF Valley, although illness prevented him from fulfilling the post. From August 1942 until the end of the year he served with Group HQ at Uxbridge. Three months as Commanding Officer at RAF Hawkinge followed before a transfer to No. 12 Group HQ as a supplementary squadron leader. In December 1943 Strange was posted to No. 46 Group as Wing Commander, Operations. There he assisted in the planning for Operation Overlord, landing in Normandy himself on 15 June. He had six airstrips under his control in the expanding beachhead as this time. He was also responsible for the control and administration of a series of Temporary Staging Posts (TSP) supporting the Allied campaign. During the advance that followed the break-out from Normandy, Strange personally 'liberated' Château Lillois, 24 years after he had been the first to announce the departure of the Germans from there in 1918. In October 1944 Strange served with the HQ, 1st Allied Airborne Army. He was also at SHAEF Forward Headquarters in Reims on 6–7 May 1945 to witness negotiations to the German surrender on all fronts. Strange eventually retired from the service in June 1945. For his wartime contribution Strange was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire on 1 January 1945, and was awarded the American Bronze Star Medal in early 1946.  Postwar civil aviation  He returned to farming but continued his links with civil aviation. He bought the Taylorcraft Auster Plus D light aircraft G-AHCR and flew it in several competitions, including the Wiltshire Flying Club's Thruxton Cup Race on 26 August 1950, averaging over the route; the Daily Express sponsored South Coast Race on 16 September 1950, coming in 54th out of 61 entrants; and the 1950 Daily Express Challenge Air Trophy, at the age of 59, being the oldest of the 76 competitors. He continued to fly regularly and died peacefully in his sleep in 1966, aged 75. In recognition of the high esteem in which he was held in the RAF and his important contribution to military aviation, the Squadron Briefing Room in the new No. 23 Squadron Headquarters building, which was officially opened by the AOC-in-C Strike Command on 2 April 1997, was named \\"The Strange Room\\". His daughter, Susan Strange, was an eminent British scholar in international relations.

In this case, the House of Lords reconsidered its ruling in the earlier landmark case Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd concerning the liability of multiple tortfeasors. The main question in this case was whether the solvent employers should pick up the proportion of the damage for which the insolvent employers were responsible. In other words, should a tortfeasor or a claimant bear the risk of the other tortfeasors going insolvent? Facts Like in Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd, the claimants had contracted mesothelioma after having worked for a number of different employers, all of whom had negligently exposed them to asbestos. What distinguishes this case from Fairchild is that the conduct of the employers of the claimants were not exclusively tortious.Barker v Corus [2006] UKHL 20 Mesothelioma is a fatal illness which is caused by exposure to asbestos, but the risk of which increases depending on how often one is exposed. Because of long latency periods (it takes 25 to 50 years before symptoms of disease become evident) it was impossible to know which employer actually caused the disease, although all of them admittedly increased the risk of the disease occurring. Unlike Fairchild, in which the House of Lords held that all the employers were jointly and severally liable for the damage, in this case some of the employers have become insolvent. Judgment The House of Lords, by a majority, accepted the argument that the solvent employer should not be jointly and severally liable, but only proportionately liable. Lord Hoffmann said the following. Significance The outcome was a new concept of \\"proportionate liability\\". So for example, Mr B has worked for employers X, Y, and Z for ten years each. X, Y and Z have all exposed Mr B to asbestos, and it is not possible to say with which employer Mr B had contracted a disease. But now X and Y have gone insolvent, and Mr B is suing Z. Under the Barker v. Corus principle, Z would only have to pay one third of the full compensation for Mr B's disease, in other words, Z has only \\"proportionate liability\\" for that part which he materially increased the risk of Mr B's harm. This outcome was advocated by a number of academics.see, e.g. Peter Cane, Atiyah's Accidents, Compensation and the Law (2006) 99 After the decision in Barker there was a swift and fierce political backlash, with large numbers of workers, families, trade unions, and Members of Parliament calling for the reversal of the ruling. This was on the basis that it would undermine full compensation for working people and their families. Soon enough the Compensation Act 2006Full text of the Compensation Act 2006 was introduced, specifically to reverse the ruling. However the Act only applies to mesothelioma. What remains to be seen is whether the \\"proportionate liability\\" idea will crop up in other situations. The essential decision to be made is whether a tortfeasor or a claimant should bear the risk of other tortfeasors going insolvent. It is important to keep in mind, that in the example above, Z may not have actually caused any harm. Moreover, it might have been that Z in fact caused all the harm.

Biography  Cubillo was born on 3 June 1930, in San Cristóbal de La Laguna and received a law degree from the University of La Laguna. He was married and had 3 children. He founded the Canary Islands Independence Movement in 1963. While exiled in Algiers, escaping the Francoist dictatorial regime, Antonio Cubillo began a campaign to claim independence from the Spanish rule in the late 1970s. In 1978 he was crippled in an assassination attempt linked to the security forces of the Spanish Ministry of the Interior. After the movement was disbanded in 1982 (following the creation of the Canary Islands Autonomous Community), he was able to return to Spain and found a democratic party in 1985,El Guanche the National Congress of the Canaries. In 2002, the Madrid supreme court recognized that the Government of Spain committed a crime of state terrorism against his person in 1978 and paid him damages as a result. To this day, this is the first time the State officially recognized it engaged in crimes against civilians. In 2011, a documentary called Cubillo: The Story of a State Crime was shown on National TV highlighting the role of the State. Cubillo's core claims have always been that the Canary Islands could be better off if it could keep and develop more of its resources and thus maintain greater autonomy from Madrid. He claimed that the resources are considerable in terms of tourism, geo-political locations for maritime traffic development, fishing fields, oil fields and natural energy resources. The movement he founded, however, failed to attract public support among Canarios owing to its violent nature. The organizations that have succeeded it, such as the Popular Front of the Canary Islands (FREPIC), have remained largely marginal.Historia electoral, Coalición Canaria He died on 10 December, 2012, at his home in Santa Cruz de Tenerife.

According to Parkinson, in his book British Intervention in Malaya 1867-1877, the \\"Hysan or Tokong\\" leader in Penang was \\"Chan Keng Kwi\\", with \\"Lew Ah Sam\\" as leader in Larut.\\"British intervention in Malaya, 1867-1877\\" by Cyril Northcote Parkinson Published by University of Malaya Press, 1960 googlebooks  16 June 1865  In a gambling house in Klian Pauh, a quarrel between a Fui Chew Hakka and a Chung Shan Hakka. In Perak the Fui Chew Hakka were members of the Ghee Hin society and likewise the Chung Shan Hakka there were members of the Hai San Society. The disturbance escalated when 1,000 armed Chung Shan Hakka men turned up and attacked the Fui Chew taking 14 Fui Chew men prisoner. The Malay Clerk (Kerani) and police did not interfere. Loh Chong and Lim Seng, both Hockiens from Penang who were merchants trading in Larut attempted to find a peaceful settlement. They went to the village and approached Chong Chong the head of the Fui Chew Hakka, asking him to restrain his men till a peaceful settlement could be achieved. Chong Chong agreed and asked Loh Chong to get Lau Sam, head of the Chung Shan Hakka at Larut, to apply to the Raja for 200 Malays to keep the peace. The two merchants approached Lau Sam at Klian Pauh who, having agreed to this course of action, requested the Jemadar (the ranking police officer) at the Balai (police station) to send a Malay guard to keep the peace till negotiations could be effected. Judge and Magistrate Abdul Jabbar shortly arrived at the Balai with 200 armed Malays. About 20 to 30 of these were then sent to Klian Bahru with Abdul Jabbar's proclamation that no Fui Chew be allowed to leave and that no one be allowed to take them any provisions. In the afternoon some Hockien men went to negotiate a settlement to the quarrel. They arrived back at about 9pm with news that a settlement was agreed and that an agreement would be drawn up at 8am the following day.  17 June 1865  At about midnight the Chung Shan took out their 14 Fui Chew prisoners, thrust sharpened bamboo into the necks of each, painted their flags with the blood and executed all but one of their prisoners who managed to escape to Klian Bahru. In the early morning of 17 June 1865 about 300 to 400 armed Fui Chew Hakka from Klian Bahru arrived at Klian Pauh and attacked the Chung Shan. Once again those Chinese not a party to dispute i.e. the Hockiens attempted to affect peaceful settlement.  19 June 1865  Loh Chong and his party negotiated with the Fui Chew and proposed that they pay a fine of $1,000 to the Chung Sang Hakka and while this was ultimately agreed it left a bitter taste in the mouths of the Fui Chew who had already lost many of their people in the fighting that took place. Loh Chong left at about noon that day but shortly after his departure another fight broke out between the two sides. Abdul Jabbar with 200 armed Malays and a large gun attempted to disperse the parties concerned and eventually opened fire.  20 June 1865  The Fui Chews then retired to Klian Bahru. Under the direction of Ngah Lamat and Kulop Mat Ali, two groups then set out in pursuit of the Fui Chew Hakka, one party of Malays led by Penghulu Sunu and another group of Malays accompanying the Chung Shan Hakka. By noon 20 June 1865 the Fui Chew were utterly defeated.  How It Ended  Their houses of the Fui Chew Hakka were destroyed completely. Their provisions seized. Their tin taken to the Balai and most of the ore taken to Chung Keng Quee's smelting house. So Ah Chiang, leader of the Ghee Hin was captured by Ngah Ibrahim at Teluk Kertang (Port Weld) and executed. The battle continued back and forth and spread to Province Wellesley and the island of Penang and other secret societies joined the fray. Both sides, exhausted, finally came to terms. An official inquiry took place and both the Hai San and Ghee Hin societies were fined $5,000 each for violating the peace of Penang and their leaders, banished. By around 1870 there were a combined total of about 40,000 Hakka and Cantonese mine workers in the Larut district and the mining areas between the two groups were near to each other. It is this proximity that might explain how the next battle began.  Notes  = Sources = The Western Malay States 1850-1873: The Effects of Commercial Development on Malay Politics.

He represented the Crown in the ecclesiastical courts of the Church of England, where cases were argued not by barristers but by advocates (see Doctor's Commons). In the nineteenth century much of the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts was transferred to other courts, firstly the Courts of Probate and Divorce and Matrimonial Causes and eventually the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court of Justice. The position of Queen's Advocate remained vacant after the resignation of Sir Travers Twiss in 1872. Use in colonies and extraterritorial jurisdictions In some British colonies and extraterritorial British courts, the principal British Government lawyer was called the King's Advocate, Queen's Advocate or Crown Advocate. For example, before the British Supreme Court for China and Japan and in Malta the principal British Government lawyer was called the Crown Advocate. In Cyprus, he was referred to as the King's Advocate. The Attorney General of Sri Lanka was known as the King's Advocate or Queen's Advocate between 1833 to 1884.

The team participated in the Tasmanian Football League from 1945 to 1997. Club history The club was founded in November 1944 as a result of a meeting called by the late Bill Barwick at Wrest Point Riviera (now Wrest Point Casino). With World War II in its final stages it became clear that some former TANFL clubs would not survive and as a result, the League's Constitution was amended to provide for district football. In 1945 four clubs, Sandy Bay, North Hobart, New Town and Hobart, took part in the revamped competition. Sandy Bay adopted the colours of Royal Blue and White, the playing jumper was Royal Blue and White with a white seagull on the breast. This was used by the club between 1945–1966 and from 1967 onwards, the club wore a Blue and White vertical striped playing jumper. Sandy Bay was given permission by the Hobart City Council to use Queenborough Oval in Sandy Bay as its home ground and a weatherboard changeroom was erected on the site of where the Graeme Mackey Stand and Pavilion would be built twenty years later. Sandy Bay's emblem was the Seagull, generally thought to be named after all the seagulls that hung around the waterfront suburb where the club was located. Sandy Bay team posing for the photographer, c. 1950. Sandy Bay participated in the Tasmanian Football League with a strong degree of success in its first three decades in the competition, participating in fifteen TFL Grand Finals between 1945–1978 (including eight consecutive Grand Finals from 1971–1978) and winning the Tasmanian State Premiership twice in 1946 and 1971. But after losing the 1979 TANFL Preliminary Final by 19 points to Clarence, the club's era of dominance was over. Another problem looming for Sandy Bay was that during their remarkable period of sustained success during the 1970s, the demographic of their area had begun to change to a more upmarket occupancy and as a result, their supporter base withered away badly during this time. Home games at Queenborough Oval reflected this trend where their average home attendances had fallen from a 3,823-average in 1970 to just a 995-average by 1980. It was during this time that the Hobart Mercury and other sports commentators began to headlines calls for the club to vacate Queenborough Oval and relocate to either the North Hobart Oval or into the Kingborough region, south of Hobart. Despite improving attendances at home in 1981 and 1982, the Seagulls made the move to North Hobart Oval in 1983, where they played all of their home fixtures at the ground. Buoyed by increased attendances, the club made it all the way to the Preliminary Final, where it suffered a 53-point loss to New Norfolk. But the success of the 1983 season proved to be mirage, as the club sunk back down the ladder, struggling for attendances. With the beginning of the new TFL Statewide League competition in 1986, the Seagulls made a permanent return to Queenborough, and with solid home crowds, the club had a brilliant season. At one stage the Seaguls won 13 matches in succession under Andy Bennett, leading them into their first Grand Final since 1978. But the Seagulls juggernaut stopped in spectacular fashion on Grand Final day, where they trailed badly all day en route to a 32-point defeat at the hands of Glenorchy. From 1987 onwards, it was a case of doom and gloom for the struggling Seagulls. Their supporter base was continuing to fall and the club was struggling financially, despite a strong finish to the 1990 season, in which they made it to the First Semi Final and held a 38-point lead early in the match before being overrun by eventual premier, Hobart by 33 points. The bottom fell out of the club only eighteen months later. During the 1992 season, Sandy Bay required an immediate cash injection of $70,000 in the middle of the season in order to keep the club afloat until the end of the season. A 'Save The Bay' campaign was hastily organised and charity matches took place in order to raise funds for what was now an ailing club. After various TFL and media-driven merger attempts over a number of years, the Bay moved back to North Hobart Oval in 1994, when the club made its last finals appearance. After finishing second on the ladder during the roster season, they would make it to the Preliminary Final, but the club suffered from a dreadful start to the match and despite a second half rally, ultimately bowed out to New Norfolk by 26-points. From 1995 the Seagulls battled on as more merger attempts were foist upon them, but no more success came its way. In 1997, president Bill Sorell, announced that the club would be wound up at the completion of the season. The Seagulls final home match at Queenborough took place on Sunday, 27 July 1997, when they hosted Glenorchy. Sandy Bay were beaten convincingly by 101-points. Three weeks later it would be all over for the Sandy Bay Football Club, their final match taking place at Bellerive Oval on 16 August 1997, when they suffered a 76-point defeat to Clarence amid emotional scenes and a standing ovation from the crowd as they left the ground for the final time. A short time later, the club was wound up and closed down.

The dish consists of spaghetti, tomato ketchup or a tomato-based sauce, onion, button mushrooms, green peppers, sausage, bacon and optionally Tabasco sauce. Naporitan is claimed to be from Yokohama. An instant Naporitan is also available in Japan today.  Origin  It was created by Shigetada Irie (), the general chef of the New Grand Hotel (Hotel New Grand) in Yokohama, when he was inspired by one of the military rations of GHQ, which was spaghetti mixed with tomato ketchup.  Name  The chef named the dish after Naples, Italy (hence \\"Napoli\\"). Phonetically, the Japanese language doesn't distinguish R and L as separate sounds, and so uses the same katakana characters to represent R and L sounds of Western alphabets. Thus when converting katakana back into English, based solely on the Japanese writing the spelling in the English alphabet is ambiguous and can vary. The spelling Naporitan is derived from the usual romanization of Japanese, while the spelling Napolitan takes the origin of the name into account.

He played in the Scottish Football League for Hibernian, Dundee United, Airdrieonians and Meadowbank Thistle. Career Campbell was born on the island of Benbecula in the Outer Hebrides. He began his football career in local amateur football, making his debut for the Benbecula team aged just ten. He later played for Harris and helped them to the Lewis and Harris Football League title in 1978. By this time Campbell was a student at the University of Edinburgh and while playing for the university football team he was recommended to Hibernian, signing for them in the summer of 1978. Making his debut in October that year, Campbell finished the season with a Scottish Cup runners-up medal. Hibs lost the 1979 Scottish Cup Final in a twice-replayed final against Rangers. In the first final, which ended goalless, Campbell was apparently fouled in the penalty box by Rangers goalkeeper Peter McCloy. Campbell unsuccessfully attempted to retrieve the ball instead of appealing for a penalty, and the referee chose not to award one. After a second season with Hibs ended in relegation, Campbell moved to Dundee United. He played just four times during the 1980-81 season, after which Campbell left United. He then moved to Airdrieonians and, despite being in the Premier Division, dropped down to part-time football to combine working in his own sports shop. A short spell with Meadowbank Thistle followed before he \\"more or less stopped playing at 28\\", although he did subsequently appear for Spartans in the East of Scotland Football League.

After Namibia gained independence in 1990, Shityuwete published his autobiography titled \\"Never Follow the Wolf\\" which chronicled his time on Robben Island as well as his trial for involvement in the Namibian War of Independence as commander of the People's Liberation Army of Namibia, the military wing of the South West Africa People's Organization. Early life and exile Shityuwete was the 19th child of 22 to his father and was named by his grandfather, Nelindi Shityuwete, king of Evale. He worked as a contract labourer under the apartheid South African occupation and became interested in politics working in Walvis Bay docks in 1959, when he was one of the labourers who first joined Ovamboland People's Organization, which on 19 April 1960 became SWAPO. He made several trips to Angola including with Jakob Kuhangwa, guided by Eliaser Tuhadeleni nickname Kaxumba Kandola. In 1964 he was among a group that left Namibia and were arrested at the Botswana border and escaped and eventually arrived for military training in Tanzania. He returned to Namibia in 1966 as part of PLAN cadre G2 to participate in the Namibian War of Independence, but he and three of the four others of the group were arrested at Nkurenkuru by the South African Police. They were detained in Pretoria, South Africa, and held for two years before a trial in September 1967 for him and 32 others under the Terrorism Act of 1967. In 1968 he was sentenced to 20 years on Robben Island prison, others such as Nathaniel Maxuilili and Jason Mutumbulwa got lesser sentences. Ephraim Kapolo dies during the trial in Pretoria. Others in Robben Island prison at the same time included Jerry Ekandjo, John Pandeni, John Ya Otto Nankudhu, Andimba Toivo ya Toivo, Gerson Veii, Kaxumba Kandola, Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu. On 7 May 1984 Shityuwete was released from prison and in February 1985, received a scholarship through the Council of Churches in Namibia to study at the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom, sponsored by Africa Educational Trust. He studied in Birmingham until 1987, when he graduated and moved to London, where he married Jane (née Prewett) and had a daughter, Tulimelila. Return to Namibia Shityuwete returned to Namibia in 1989 upon the establishment of the Constituent Assembly, which wrote the Namibian Constitution. His family joined him on 16 March 1990, five days before Namibia's official independence on 21 March 1990. After independence, he was hired to help found the Ministry of Labour as Deputy Director of Human Resources, where he worked with future ambassador Ponhele ya France as well as Katrina Itula. He worked in the Labour Ministry until retirement in 1996. Their son, Freddy, was born in 1991. In 2008, Shityuwete was diagnosed with lymphoma and had successful surgery to remove the cancer in neighboring South Africa. In early 2010, he also suffered a stroke which left him unable to speak English, though he later recovered the ability to speak it through the help of a language therapist. He continued very active after his retirement, including in Namibia-Angola friendship and being Director of the Namibian Former Robben Island Political Prisoners Trust.Helao Shityuwete - a Personal Account, by Tuli Shiyuwete The Namibian, 25 August 2014Helao Shityuwete – Still a Fighter The Namibian, 14 March 2011 References * Shityuwete, Helao, Never Follow the Wolf, 1990 1934 births Living people People's Liberation Army of Namibia personnel Namibian writers Namibian people imprisoned abroad Prisoners and detainees of South Africa Alumni of the University of Birmingham Namibian expatriates in the United Kingdom Trials in South Africa Inmates of Robben Island 20th-century Namibian writers ","title":"Helao Shityuwete"},{"id":"16000211","text":"Nagpur has a population of 4.6 million.

He also spent time on loan with Walsall and Lillestrøm. After playing professional football for almost 20 years, Rønningen retired after the 2012-season, and joined HamKam as a goalkeeper coach. Career =Early years= Rønningen was born in Lunner and played for the local club Lunner IL until he joined Vålerenga in 1994. He made his debut for Vålerenga in the 1997 Norwegian Football Cup match against Brann, and became the first goalkeeper to score a goal in an official match, when he scored from the penalty spot in the 6–0 victory against Eik-Tønsberg. Rønningen did not get many chances for Vålerenga, and in the spring of 1999 he was loaned out to English club Walsall. When Rønningen returned to Norway, the only club who wanted to get Rønningen on loan was the Norwegian Third Division side Grindvoll. Lillestrøm needed a goalkeeper-reserve in the fall of 1999, and Thodesen tipped the club that Rønningen was available for loan. =Brann= After Thodesen was hired as Teitur Thordarson's assistant in Brann ahead of the 2000 season, he brought Rønningen to the club. After a year as the second-choice goalkeeper, but got the chance when Magnus Kihlstedt was injured in the spring of 2001. Rønningen soon became the first choice at Brann, and in August 2001 he was called up to the Norway national football team, two years after he was playing in the Third Division. Rønningen was never capped for Norway, but did play one match for Norway B against Romania in January 2002, in addition to two matches for the under-21 team and one match for the under-18 team. Rønningen scored a goal from the penalty spot in the 4–1 victory against Hovding in the second round of the 2002 Norwegian Football Cup. Brann was leading 3–1 and had been awarded a penalty kick, which Rønningen converted. Rønningen remained a regular at Brann, even though he was competing with the talented youngster Håkon Opdal, and played a total of 95 matches for the club, until he in the summer of 2004 transferred to rivals Rosenborg. =Rosenborg= That he transferred to Rosenborg was quite a surprise, as they already had the goalkeepers Espen Johnsen and Alexander Lund Hansen . Rønningen was however not happy with the contract negotiation with Brann, and moved to Rosenborg where he received a bigger payment, even though he was supposed to be the third-choice goalkeeper. The young goalkeeper Lund Hansen was sent on loan to Fredrikstad FK so that he could play regularly, and Rønningen remained the second-choice goalkeeper at Rosenborg, but did however play the first round of the 2005 Norwegian Football Cup against Orkla, where he scored one of the goals from the penalty spot in the 11–0 victory. =HamKam= Rønningen moved to HamKam ahead of the 2006 season, and was the first-choice goalkeeper until Jon Masalin became the preferred goalkeeper half-way through the 2008 season. Rønningen wanted to leave HamKam, but after Masalin was injured Rønningen again became the first choice. Rønningen stayed at the club through two relegations, even though his payment was reduced from 1,2 M NOK at Rosenborg to 0,2 M NOK at the third tier. He scored a goal on a penalty when HamKam won promotion back to the second tier with a 6–0 victory against Lørenskog in the decisive match of the 2010 season. According to the local newspaper Hamar Arbeiderblad, Rønningen was HamKam's best player in the 2011 season, and the 36-year-old decided to play for one more season, despite being called \\"father\\" by his younger teammates. He was however injured in the beginning of the next season, and he believed he had played his last match for HamKam, but when his replacement Gary Hogan was injured, Rønningen was again playing. After playing for the club for seven seasons, Rønningen retired after the 2012 season and joined HamKam's coaching staff as a goalkeeper coach, where he was working the talented goalkeepers Lars Øvernes and Emil Holst.

The population of the civil parish, including Kingerby, Kirkby and Usselby, and West Rasen in its own civil parish, was 660 at the 2011 census. Osgodby is close to the A1103 and A46 roads, and north-west from the market town of Market Rasen. The parish contains the small villages of Kingerby, Kirkby cum Osgodby, Osgodby itself, Usselby and the hamlet of Bishopbridge. To the north is North Owersby. Nearby to the west is the north- south River Ancholme. The population of the parish is 646. History At the time of Domesday Book the village consisted of 41 households. There are medieval settlement remains, including a moat, visible as earthworks and thought to be part of Tournay Manor which was established during the 14th century. In 1424 John Tournay was given as a gift land on the south side of Osgodby, but the principal residence of the family was at Caenby. During the Second World War there was an army camp at Osgodby, and 60 accommodation huts were dispersed within nearby woodland. One building remains at the junction of the A46 - A1103, function unknown, and where the woods border the A1103, Westwards from the A46, many of the foundations are still visible. Bishopbridge The River Ancholme and The Bell at Bishopbridge Bishopbridge is a hamlet at the western limit of the parish of Osgodby, on the A631 and is named after the bridge that crosses the River Ancholme at this point. The hamlet consists of a public house and a few farms and houses. The settlement marks the upper limit of the navigation of the Ancholme, which was created by an Act of Parliament in 1767, which records the location as Bishop Brigys, in a later Act of 1802 it has changed to Bishop Briggs. The navigation ends where there is a measurement weir at the gauging station that records the flow of the river. On the adjacent River Rase, another weir and gauging station measures the flow of that river. Both sites are listed as Bishopbridge.

In 1970, he originally published it in eight installments in the student newspaper The Maine Campus. It's a Western parody about gunslinger Jack Slade, who protects a damsel in distress against some outlaws. Story Gunslinger Jack Slade comes to Dead Steer Springs, called upon by Sandra Dawson, whose farm is threatened by the outlaw Sam Columbine – he wants to sell the land to the railroad. But in fact, everything is a sham; Sandra turns out to be Slade's ex-girlfriend – whom he believes dead. She couldn't get along with Slade anymore and conspired with Columbine to kill Slade. Both, however, didn't take into consideration that Slade is prone to wearing bullet-proof blue underwear (with nice flowers). Slade, playing possum after a duel, shoots both conspirators. Then he needs a joint before setting out for future adventures. Connections to The Dark Tower Even though Slade is, of course, a much shallower and most of all much less serious character than King's later creation Roland Deschain, Slade can be considered a first test run for the famous gunslinger: *Like Slade, Roland pines for his lost love (Susan Delgado). *Both smoke whenever possible. *Both always hit what they shoot at. *Both only speak when necessary and are used to journeying alone. *Like the gunslingers in The Dark Tower (see especially Wolves of the Calla), Slade feels the obligation to help if called upon.

He was a son of Christiaan Snelleman and Sara Lacombe. Snelleman was married three times, to Josepha Hendrika Dupont (1860-1899), Catharina Johanna Elisabeth Augusta Inckel (born 1870), and Theodora Maria Beun (1887-1964).Genealogical information Johannes François Snelleman Expeditions and publications Between 1887 and 1889 Snelleman participated as zoologist in a scientific expedition to Central Sumatra (Netherlands East Indies), with the objective to map the Hari River basin to do research into the natural environment and the people. The expedition, organised by the Royal Netherlands Geographical Society, was led by lieutenant Johannes Schouw Santvoort, Royal Dutch Navy, with members D.D. Veth (son of KNAG chairman P.J. Veth) and A.L. van Hasselt. Snelleman wrote a book about the expedition. After the Sumatra Expedition Snelleman and Veth senior and junior kept a close contact. During a later KNAG expedition in Angola in 1884/'85, D.D. Veth died of exhaustion. Together with his father P.J. Veth Snelleman wrote a book about D.D. Veth and the expedition in South West Africa. Later, Snelleman would cooperate in a book series published by Veth, and titled Java, geographisch, ethnologisch, historisch (Java: geography, ethnography, history). Snelleman was editor of the four volume Encyclopaedie van Nederlandsch-Indië (Encyclopedia the Netherlands Indies), started in 1896 with P.A. van der Lith as sole editor. Snelleman cooperated with Van der Lith on volume two (1899) and became joint editor for volume three (1902). After the death of Van der Lith in March 1901, Snelleman completed the final volume (1905) as sole editor. Together with H.D. Benjamins, Snelleman published the Encyclopaedie van Nederlandsch West-Indië (Encyclopedia of the Dutch West Indies)Encyclopaedie van Nederlandsch West-Indië - Lijst van medewerkers With the same Benjamins, Snelleman started the journal :nl:De West-Indische Gids (West Indian Guide) in 1919. Museum director In the (late?) 1880s and 1890s, Snelleman was curator of the Museum voor Volkenkunde National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden. In 1901 Snelleman was appointed director of the Ethnologisch Museum (Ethnological Museum) in Rotterdam (later named Museum voor Land- en Volkenkunde and currently Wereldmuseum Rotterdam) and the Maritiem Museum 'Prins Hendrik' (Maritime Museum 'Prince Hendrik') in that city. These two, thematically unconnected museums, were placed under a single directorship in 1885. He kept this position until early 1915, when he took his retirement due to ill-health.

White and published by Atheneum Publishers in 1961, is a book that recounts and analyzes the 1960 election in which John F. Kennedy was elected President of the United States. The book won the 1962 Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction and was the first in a series of books by White about American presidential elections. (The others are The Making of the President 1964 (1965), The Making of the President 1968 (1969), and The Making of the President 1972 (1973).) The book traces the 1960 campaign from the primaries (in which John F. Kennedy faced Minnesota Senator Hubert Humphrey and Missouri Senator Stuart Symington) to the conclusion of the general election contest against Richard Nixon. Much of the narrative is written in an almost novelistic style, describing politicians' looks, voices and personalities. But it also contains thought- provoking discussions of various trends in American life and politics. The Making of the President 1960 was a huge success, staying on the best-seller list for more than 40 weeks. Critics and journalists hailed it as a new way of looking at its subject. It had a huge impact on political reporting and even on American politics itself. As White noted, it was an up-close look at a leader under the pressure of circumstances.H.White, H.

A scrapstore or scrap store is a particular type of organization centered upon the principle of re-use and may be operated as for profit or not for profit. The basic operational principle of all Scrapstores is the same, although their business models may differ significantly. The terms Scrapstore and Creative Reuse can be used interchangeably although Scrapstore is preferred in the UK and Creative Reuse is often used in the USA The basic principle Scrapstores operate by taking re-usable, safe, clean waste products (‘scrap’) and re- distributing it. Usually these materials come from local industries and are donated, although there is a cost to the scrapstore in terms of collection and sorting etc. The benefit to the businesses is that they are getting rid of material that they would normally pay to dispose of and that they are seen to play a part in their local community. Being significantly different from scrapyards, the re-use element tends to be dominated by art and craft activities – often aimed at those working with young children - but items may also be used in do-it-yourself or other activities. It is also common for scrapstores to trade in new art and craft products to complement the sale of scrap. The business models Some scrapstores operate as charities, with the provision of re-use items to local schools and playgroups as their core aim. Others operate as social enterprises, with reduction of landfill and provision of re-use items being part of their triple bottom line and with profit being used to support a charity, or another social aim. The most visible difference between the two business models is one of access and price structure. The charitable model as outlined by Children’s Scrapstore tends towards closed membership and restricted access. They are frequently funded, specifically to provide materials to particular groups within their community and access is restricted to these groups. The groups usually pay an annual membership fee, which may fluctuate based on the size and location of the group. They usually then make another volume related payment each time they take away scrap material. Access may be limited to a certain number of visits per month, a certain volume of scrap or there may be limits on particularly desirable items in order to give all members an opportunity to access them. The social enterprise model as outlined by Unique Scrapstore tends to be more recognizable as a business. Such stores will tend to have a more defined pricing structure and lower membership fees. There still tends to be a focus on customers who work with young children, (including discount schemes or free items) but such stores are more likely to be open to the public as well. (some scrapstores also offer on-line or mail order services) Social enterprise based scrapstores will tend to have clear, measurable re-use targets incorporated into their triple bottom line. Scrap swaps Whilst the UK scrap stores (approximately 90) are all separate organizations, they do work together to use large volumes of scrap that arise from specific companies or events. Additionally scrap stores who collect surplus specific materials from their own area swap their excess with other scrap stores from other areas to ensure variety for their members and maximum reuse potential.  Workshops  In addition to providing re-use items, some ScrapStore stores also provide an outreach provision in the form of workshops where participants can demonstrate examples of ways in which they can put ‘reducing, reusing and recycling’ into practice in a shared environment and have a better understanding of their commitment to improving the environment; the local economy; and society by reducing waste in landfill. As part of the 2017, UK City of Culture Celebrations, the ScrapStore in Hull offered a series of educational craft workshops set in a pretend factory environment designed to inspire families to make a difference to their community through increased environmental awareness. Awards Worcestershire Resource Exchange, which run a scrapstore, has been recognised with a Queen's Award for Voluntary Service by Deputy Lord-Lieutenant Andrew Duncan.

History What had been the original WHAV (1490 AM) changed formats and call signs on September 8, 2002, when owner Costa-Eagle Radio Ventures Limited Partnership—a partnership between Pat Costa and The Eagle-Tribune—completed a complicated three-way format and call letter swap between their three AM stations in the region. WCCM (800 AM) moved to the WHAV frequency at 1490 kHz, WNNW moved to WCCM’s 800 kHz frequency and WHAV’s programming moved to WNNW’s 1110 kHz frequency and became known as WCEC.Sunday Eagle-Tribune, September 8, 2002 During the summer of 2007, another frequency swap occurred and WCCM moved to 1110 kHz and WCEC moved to 1490 kHz. In a series of legal filings, the right to the WHAV name was assumed by COCO+CO., Inc.’s Xelocast division, using it to launch a new English-language Internet radio station January 3, 2004 at whav.net. Since that time, a number of cable television stations have also agreed to carry its locally oriented programming. WHAV also broadcasts at low power on 1640 AM for the Haverhill area.

This confirms the general belief reported by Scott that Ferrara was a Spanish or Italian artificer who was brought to Scotland in the early sixteenth century by James IV to instruct the Scots in the manufacture of the high-quality steel blades current in Renaissance Europe.

It is of great architectural importance to the city and area. The mosque's architect was Zlatko Ugljen, the craftsman was Ismet Imamović, while the contractor was Zvijezda from Visoko. Original mosque was built in 1477, but it was completely reconstructed and finished in 1980. Its most notable award came in 1983, when it received the Aga Khan Award for Architecture. The jury commended the mosque for its boldness, creativity and brilliance, as well as its originality and innovation. In 2007 it received another recognition, this time from Hungarian architects for being one of the three best designed places of worship in Europe. Plan, structure and materials The mosque comprises five functional areas: *Access space and first courtyard *Mosque proper *Annex building *Graveyard *Minarets The central space of the mosque is designed both for praying and other religious activities such as lectures and discussions. The indoor area for praying is an annex building. The annex consists of a small auditorium and an office. Traditionally, in Bosnian mosques, graveyards act as a buffer between mosque and other buildings, but in this case, the graveyard is isolated. Architect Zlatko Ugljen used the traditional layout of Bosnian mosques which consist of a courtyard leading to a square praying area, over which rises a cupola. The difference is in an unusual arrangement of this concept, where large glass panels make this mosque more integrated with the rest of the building. Windows with five panels symbolizes Five Pillars of Islam, but also casts light in the interior. The southeast facade of the cupola is faced toward the Ka'ba. Fountains, pulpit and other decorative elements are simple, just like the calligraphy in the interior which is simple and readable. Both the interior and exterior of the mosque are painted white, while the beige color was used for the floor, and green for a few metallic elements, like frames and tubes. Building materials used were plastered concrete for walls and cupola, white mortar for the inner walls, a combination of pine wood and white mortar for surfaces of many interior elements, local travertine tiles for exterior paths and courtyard paving, and iron tubes for minarets, while the floors inside of the mosque are covered with green carpet. Aga Khan Award for Architecture The award that came from the Aga Khan Development Network listed this mosque as one of the most valuable modern mosques built in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The network stated that: > The mosque serves as a religious and intellectual centre for its community. > Its geometrically simple plan encloses a complex, slope-ceilinged, skylit > volume, pure, abstract, sparsely ornamented and painted white. The > archetypal Bosnian mosque has a simple square plan crowned by a cupola and > entered by means of a small porch. The White Mosque's plan conforms to the > archetype, but its roof is a freely deformed quarter of a cupola, pierced by > five skylights, themselves composed of segments of quarter cupolas. The > effect is one of confrontation between the elementary plan and the > sophisticated hierarchy of roof cones. The principal symbolic elements, > mihrab, minbar, minaret and fountains, have a fresh folk art character > subtly enhanced by the avant-garde geometries of their setting. Zlatko Ugljen has also been commended for \\"masterfully assimilat[ing] modern influences, especially Le Corbusier's Ronchamp Cathedral, and traditional Ottoman forms and elements\\".

This village was founded by migrants from Amazo Gharai Mardan (near Sawabi) in 1718. It got its name from its proximity to a large stone which looked like a human skull.. In Pashto, a human skull is called a Kooprai which was corrupted to Kupri over the years. The father (Baba) of this village migrated from District Mardan and his name was Ahmed Baba. The main tribes in Amazai are Pathans (Yousafzai, Tanoli), Mughals and Gujjars. The population is approximately 3500 and the predominant occupations are in agriculture. There are two mosques (Sunni Islam) and a Hujra in Kupri. People come to Hujra and sit together and discuss their issues.

Currently, the most explicitly libertarian party in the United Kingdom is the Libertarian Party. However, there has also been a long-standing right-libertarian faction of the mainstream Conservative Party that espouses Thatcherism. UK voters have tended to vote more in line with their position along the traditional 'left-right’ division rather than along libertarian-authoritarian lines, and so libertarians in the United Kingdom have supported parties across the political spectrum.  Political parties  = Libertarian parties = The Libertarian Party is the main libertarian party within the United Kingdom describing itself as being a \\"Classically Liberal, Regionalist and Minarchist organisation\\". The Liberal Party was formed in 1989 from those opposed to the merger between the Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party. The Scottish Libertarian Party was formed as a separate party in 2012 and officially registered in 2014. = Relationship with the Conservative Party = Libertarianism, and particularly right-libertarianism, became more prominent in British politics after the promotion of neoliberalism and economic liberalism under the premiership of Margaret Thatcher. Since the 1980s, a number of Conservative MPs have been considered to have libertarian leanings, and libertarian groups have been perceived to exert considerable influence over the Party. However, in her first Conservative Party conference speech as leader, Theresa May attacked the \\"libertarian right\\" and argued for a more pro-state communitarian conservatism. In recent years, Conservative Party policy has appeared to move further away from libertarianism, and a smaller proportion of their support has come from voters with libertarian attitudes. = Relationship with the Green Party of England and Wales = Sociologist Chris Rootes stated that the Green Party took \\"the left-libertarian\\" vote, while Dennison and Goodwin characterised it as reflecting \\"libertarian- universalistic values\\". The party wants an end to big government – which they see as hindering open and transparent democracy – and want to limit the power of big business – which, they argue, upholds the unsustainable trend of globalisation, and is detrimental to local trade and economies. There have been allegations of factionalism and infighting in the Green Party between liberal, socialist, and anarchist factions. = Relationship with the UK Independence Party = As leader of the Eurosceptic UK Independence Party (UKIP), Nigel Farage sought to broaden the public perception of the UKIP beyond being a party solely seeking to withdraw the United Kingdom from the European Union to one of being a party broadly standing for libertarian values and reductions in government bureaucracy. The party describes itself as a \\"libertarian, non-racist Eurosceptic party\\". UKIP's original activist base was largely \\"libertarian\\", supporting an economically liberal approach. Its \\"economic libertarian\\" views have been influenced by classical liberalism and Thatcherism, with Thatcher representing a key influence on UKIP's thought. Farage has characterised UKIP as \\"the true inheritors\\" of Thatcher, claiming that the party never would have formed had Thatcher remained Prime Minister of the UK throughout the 1990s. Winlow, Hall, and Treadwell suggested that a UKIP government would pursue \\"hard-core Thatcherism\\" on economic policy. UKIP presents itself as a \\"libertarian party\\", and the political scientists David Deacon and Dominic Wring described it as articulating \\"a potent brand of libertarian populism\\". However, commentators writing in The Spectator, The Independent, and the New Statesman have all challenged the description of UKIP as libertarian, highlighting its socially conservative and economically protectionist policies as being contrary to a libertarian ethos. While Farage denied in 2007 that the party's strategy was \\"targeting David Cameron as such\\", political scientist Chris Robinson opines in 2010 that Farage may well have been hoping that this expansion of the party platform would attract voters disenchanted with Cameron premiership and thinking him \\"too Tony Blair- like\\". In 2010, the UKIP's call to ban the burkha in public places was criticised by Shami Chakrabarti as contrary to libertarianism.  Libertarian think tanks  =Libertarian Alliance= The Libertarian Alliance was the oldest and most explicitly libertarian think tank, existing until 2017 \\"[to explain] the benefits of political and economic freedom and of toleration in the sense put forth by such philosophers as John Locke, David Hume, Adam Smith, Edmund Burke, John Stuart Mill, F.A. von Hayek, Karl Popper, and many others in the British liberal tradition\\".\\"Mission Statement\\". Libertarian Alliance. Politically neutral, it has united classical liberals, minarchists, anarcho-capitalists and even social anarchists. The Libertarian Alliance's founder Chris Tame was also the director of FOREST, the smokers' rights organisation. The more conservative Society for Individual Freedom from which the Libertarian Alliance originally split was its sister organisation. =Institute of Economic Affairs= The Institute of Economic Affairs is the oldest pro-free-market think tank in the United Kingdom and a progenitor of a large network of neoliberal think tanks around the world as well as greatly shaping the Thatcher government's economic policies. =Other organisations= The Centre for Policy Studies was set up by Margaret Thatcher and Keith Joseph for the purpose of advancing classical liberalism while the Adam Smith Institute largely promotes free-market regulatory and welfare reforms. =Student societies= There are a few libertarian student societies at British universities, including Cardiff University, Queen Mary University of London (Liberty Society), Oxford, Cambridge, the London School of Economics (the Hayek Society), University College London, King's College London, St Andrews, York, Sheffield, Loughborough and Durham.  Students for Liberty UK  Students for Liberty UK is part of European Students for Liberty (an offshoot of the American charity Students for Liberty) which run conferences, workshops and leadership training for students and promote liberty across Europe.

His main works concerned Celtic and Hittite and other languages of Asia Minor. Born in a diplomatic family, he was a fluent speaker of English and German since he was a child. He worked at the department of Germanic and Celtic languages of the Institute of Linguistics (Russian Academy of Sciences) and taught at the Russian State University for the Humanities. Through his great learning and talent for languages he became one of the first Russian scholars in two particularly difficult disciplines of Indo-European studies, dedicating himself to the Celtic and ancient languages of Asia Minor. He was also an expert in the broader questions of Indo-European linguistics and culture. His best known books are “Drevnejšie pamjatniki irlandskogo jazyka” (Древнейшие памятники ирландского языка, The oldest monuments of the Irish language) (Moscow, 1984, 2nd ed. 2003), containing the full corpus of the Ogham inscriptions, known at that time, and “Vvedenie v keltologiju” (Введение в кельтлогию, Introduction toCeltic studies (in collaboration with Viktor Kalygin)) (Moscow 1989; 2nd ed. 2006). His modest position and the limited number of publications do not represent the true scope of Korolev, who was, in many scholars’ opinion, one of the best experts in Indo-European linguistics not only in Russia, but in the world as well. The realization of his brilliant potential was impeded by the difficulties of life and his untimely death.  Publications  * Королёв А. А.

Biography Born in Brooklyn, New York, she graduated from the New York School of Fine and Applied Arts in 1920 with diplomas in advertising and costume design. After graduation, she accepted a teaching position at the Texas State College for Women in Denton, Texas, then served as an instructor in Art at the Parsons School of Design from 1923–1926. After a trip to Colorado in 1926, Sibell began looking for a teaching position in the West. She received a B.S. in Art Education from New York University, and later received an M.A. in English Literature from the University of Colorado. She started teaching at the University of Colorado Boulder in 1926, and served as head of the Department of Fine Arts from 1928 to 1947, adding many options to the department while presiding over its extraordinary growth. She was not only the grande dame of the Fine Arts Department during the first half of the 20th century, but also an early champion of civil rights, accepting minorities into the Fine Arts program when some other programs informally declined to do so. During WWII, she mentored and championed the first black member of the fine arts honorary, Dolores Hale, and invited her to her home on many occasions during a time in Boulder when interracial socializing happened very rarely. Upon her arrival in Colorado, she was struck by the beauty of the mountains and began traveling into deserted mountain mining towns to sketch the remains of communities that were fast disappearing. Her sketches and watercolors provide an invaluable record of the otherwise forgotten and lost ghost towns of Colorado and the West. Sibell also authored many articles and several books about the history of the disappearing ghost towns. She became a nationally recognized author with the publication of Stampede to Timberline, The Bonanza Trail, Montana Pay Dirt, and Timberline Tailings, which she both authored and illustrated. Stampede to Timberline went through fourteen printings, becoming a definitive guidebook for ghost town enthusiasts, although many residents objected to having their towns depicted as such. Starting in 1928, Sibell designed sets and costumes for many theater productions on campus, including the operettas written and directed by her future husband, English professor Francis Wolle. In 1930 she received an M.A. in English Literature for a thesis on Shakespearean costuming. Sibell and Wolle were married in 1945 after a friendship of 18 years. They were members of St. Aidan's Church, and she was active in helping her husband, who became an ordained perpetual deacon in the Episcopal Church following his retirement from the University in 1959. Sibell Wolle retired from the University of Colorado Boulder in 1966. Sibell Wolle was active in numerous civic organizations, such as the Soroptomist Club, Delta Phi Delta, the Boulder Artist's Guild, and received many honors and prizes for her professional work. She was chosen in 1947 as a Faculty Research Lecturer for the University, the first woman to be so honored. She designed the original George Norlin Award medal for the university, and in 1957 received one herself. She was also awarded the University of Colorado's Robert Stearn's Award for outstanding faculty or staff in 1966, and in 1976 was honored as an \\"Alumni of the Century.\\" To the end of her life she remained active in her community and continued to keep her artistic record of America's mining past. She was also an avid collector of Southwestern Native American art. Muriel Sibell Wolle died on January 9, 1977. The University of Colorado Board of Regents moved to change the name of the Fine Arts Building to the Muriel Sibell Wolle Fine Arts Building, in their meeting of April 20, 1978. The building was demolished in January 2008 to make way for the new Visual Arts Complex. In March 2008, St. Aidan's Episcopal Church dedicated the Muriel Sibell Wolle Gallery in her honor.

Mass action against the ruling National Party government, coupled with South Africa's growing international isolation and economic sanctions, were instrumental in leading to negotiations to end apartheid, which began formally in 1990 and ended with South Africa's first multiracial elections under a universal franchise in 1994.Tom Lodge, \\"Action against Apartheid in South Africa, 1983–94\\", in Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash (eds), Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present. Oxford & New York: Oxford University Press, 2009, pp. 213–30. . Apartheid was adopted as a formal South African government policy by the National Party (NP) following their victory in the 1948 general election. From the early 1950s, the African National Congress (ANC) initiated its Defiance Campaign of passive resistance. Subsequent civil disobedience protests targeted curfews, pass laws, and \\"petty apartheid\\" segregation in public facilities. Some anti-apartheid demonstrations resulted in widespread rioting in Port Elizabeth and East London in 1952, but organised destruction of property was not deliberately employed until 1959. That year, anger over pass laws and environmental regulations perceived as unjust by black farmers resulted in a series of arsons targeting sugarcane plantations. Organisations such as the ANC, the South African Communist Party, and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) remained preoccupied with organising student strikes and work boycotts between 1959 and 1960. Following the Sharpeville massacre, some anti- apartheid movements, including the ANC and PAC, began a shift in tactics from peaceful non-cooperation to the formation of armed resistance wings. Mass strikes and student demonstrations continued into the 1970s, powered by growing black unemployment, the unpopularity of the South African Border War, and a newly assertive Black Consciousness Movement. The brutal suppression of the 1976 Soweto uprising radicalised a generation of black activists and greatly bolstered the strength of the ANC's guerrilla force, Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK). From 1976 to 1987 MK carried out a series of successful bomb attacks targeting government facilities, transportation lines, power stations, and other civil infrastructure. South Africa's military often retaliated by raiding ANC safe houses in neighbouring states. The National Party made several attempts to reform the apartheid system, beginning with the Constitutional Referendum of 1983. This introduced a Tricameral Parliament, which allowed for some parliamentary representation of Coloureds and Indians, but continue to deny political rights to black South Africans. The resulting controversy triggered a new wave of anti-apartheid social movements and community groups which articulated their interests through a national front in politics, the United Democratic Front (UDF). Simultaneously, inter-factional rivalry between the ANC, the PAC, and the Azanian People's Organisation (AZAPO), a third militant force, escalated into sectarian violence as the three groups jockeyed for influence. The government took the opportunity to declare a state of emergency in 1986 and detain thousands of its political opponents without trial. Secret bilateral negotiations to end apartheid commenced in 1987 as the National Party reacted to increased external pressure and the atmosphere of political unrest. Leading ANC officials such as Govan Mbeki and Walter Sisulu were released from prison between 1987 and 1989, and in 1990 the ANC and PAC were formally delisted as banned organisations by President F. W. de Klerk, and Nelson Mandela released from prison. The same year, MK reached a formal ceasefire with the South African Defence Force. Further apartheid laws were abolished on 17 June 1991, and multiparty negotiations proceeded until the first multi-racial general election held in April 1994. African National Congress Although its creation predated apartheid, the African National Congress (ANC) became the primary force in opposition to the government after its moderate leadership was superseded by the organisation's more radical Youth League (ANCYL) in 1949. Led by Walter Sisulu, Nelson Mandela and Oliver Tambo, elected to the ANC's National Executive that year, the ANCYL advocated a radical black nationalist programme that combined the Africanist ideas of Anton Lembede with those of Marxism. They brought the notion that white authority could only be overthrown through mass campaigns. The ideals of the ANC and ANCYL are stated in the ANC official web site and state, concerning the \\"Tripartite Alliance\\", \\"The Alliance is founded on a common commitment to the objectives of the National Democratic Revolution, and the need to unite the largest possible cross-section of South Africans behind these objectives.\\" This cites the actionable intent, their goal to end oppression.\\"A brief history of the African National Congress\\" , ANC. Once the ANCYL had taken control of the ANC, the organisation advocated a policy of open defiance and resistance for the first time. This unleashed the 1950s Programme of Action, instituted in 1949, which laid emphasis on the right of the African people to freedom under the flag of African Nationalism. It laid out plans for strikes, boycotts, and civil disobedience, resulting in occasionally violent clashes, with mass protests, stay-aways, boycotts and strikes predominating. The 1950 May Day stay-away was a strong, successful expression of black grievances. In 1952 the Joint Planning Council, made up of members from the ANC, the South African Indian Congress as well as the Coloured People's Congress, agreed on a plan for the defiance of unfair laws. They wrote to the Prime Minister, DF Malan and demanded that he repeal the Pass Laws, the Group Areas Act, the Bantu Administration Act and other legislation, warning that refusal to do so would be met with a campaign of defiance. The Prime Minister was haughty in his rejoinder, referring the Council to the Native Affairs Department and threatening to treat insolence callously. The Programme of Action was launched with the Defiance Campaign in June 1952. By defying the laws, the organisation hoped for mass arrests that would overwhelm the government. Nelson Mandela led a crowd of 50 men down the streets of a white area in Johannesburg after the 11 pm curfew that forbade black peoples' presence. The group was apprehended, but the rest of the country followed its example. Defiance spread throughout the country and black people disregarded racial laws by, for example, walking through \\"whites only\\" entries. At the campaign's zenith, in September 1952, more than 2,500 people from 24 different towns had been arrested for defying various laws. After five months, the African and Indian Congresses opted to call off the campaign because of the increasing number of riots, strikes and heavier sentences on those who took part. During the campaign, almost 8,000 black and Indian people had been detained. At the same time, however, ANC membership grew from 7,000 to 100,000, and the number of subdivisions went from 14 at the start of the campaign to 87 at its end. There was also a change in leadership. Shortly before the campaign's end, Albert Luthuli was elected as the new ANC president. By the end of the campaign, the government was forced to temporarily relax its apartheid legislation. Once things had calmed down, however, the government responded with an iron fist, taking several supreme measures, among which were the Unlawful Organisations Act, the Suppression of Communism Act, the Public Safety Act and the Criminal Procedures Act. The Criminal Law Amendment Act No 8 stated that \\"[Any person who in any way whatsoever advises, encourages, incites, commands, aids or procures any other person ... or uses language calculated to cause any other person to commit an offence by way of protest against the law... shall be guilty of an offence\\". In December 1952, Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu and 18 others were tried under the Suppression of Communism Act for leading the Defiance Campaign. They received nine months' imprisonment, suspended for two years. The government also tightened the regulation of separate amenities. Protesters had argued to the courts that different amenities for different races ought to be of an equal standard. The Separate Amenities Act removed the façade of mere separation; it gave the owners of public amenities the right to bar people on the basis of colour or race and made it lawful for different races to be treated inequitably. Walter Sisulu, Nelson Mandela, Albert Luthuli and other famous ANC, Indian Congress and trade union chiefs activities were all proscribed under the Suppression of Communism Act. The proscription meant that the headship was now restricted to its homes and adjacent areas and they were banned from attending public gatherings. Meanwhile, on the global stage, India demanded that apartheid be challenged by the United Nations, leading to the establishment of a UN commission on apartheid. Though under increasing restrictions, the movement was still able to struggle against the oppressive instruments of the state. More importantly, collaboration between the ANC and NIC had increased and strengthened through the Defiance Campaign. Support for the ANC and its endeavours increased. On 15 August 1953, at the Cape ANC conference in Cradock Professor Z. K. Matthews proposed a national convention of the people to study the national problems on an all-inclusive basis and outline a manifesto of amity. In March 1954, the ANC, the South African Indian Congress (SAIC), the Coloured People's Congress, the South African Congress of Democrats (SACOD) and the South African Congress of Trade Unions (SACTU) met and founded the National Action Council for the Congress of the People. Delegates were drawn from each of these establishments and a nationwide organiser was assigned. A campaign was publicised for the drafting of a freedom charter, and a call was made for 10,000 volunteer to help with the conscription of views from across the country and the organisation of the Congress of the People. Demands were documented and sent to the local board of the National Action Council in preparation for drafting the Charter. The Congress of the People was held from 25 to 26 June 1955 in Kliptown, just south of Johannesburg. Under the attentive gaze of the police, 3,000 delegates gathered to revise and accept the Freedom Charter that had been endorsed by the ANC's National Executive on the eve of the Congress. Among the organisations present were the Indian Congress and the ANC. The Freedom Charter articulated a vision for South Africa radically different from the partition policy of apartheid, emphasising that South Africa should be a just and non-racial society. It called for a one-person-one-vote democracy within a single unified state and stated that all people should be treated equally before the law, that land should be \\"shared among those who work it\\" and that the people should \\"share in the country's wealth\\" — a statement often been interpreted as a call for socialist nationalisation. The congress delegates had consented to almost all the sections of the charter when the police announced that they suspected treason and recorded the names and addresses of all those present. In 1956, the Federation of South African Women (FEDSAW) was founded and led by Lilian Ngoyi , Helen Joseph and Amina cachalia. On 9 August that year, the women marched on the Union Buildings in Pretoria, protesting against the pass laws. On the morning of 5 December 1956, however, the police detained 156 Congress Alliance leaders. 104 African, 23 white, 21 Indian and eight Coloured people were charged with high treason and plotting a violent overthrow of the state, to be replaced by a communist government. The charge was based on statements and speeches made during both the Defiance Campaign and the Congress of the People. The Freedom Charter was used as proof of the Alliance's communist intent and their conspiracy to oust the government. The State relied greatly on the evidence of Professor Arthur Murray, an ostensible authority on Marxism and Communism. His evidence was that the ANC papers were full of such communist terms as \\"comrade\\" and \\"proletariat\\", often found in the writings of Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin. Halfway through the drawn- out trial, charges against 61 of the accused were withdrawn, and, five years after their arrest, the remaining 30 were acquitted after the court held that the state had failed to prove its case. Resistance goes underground in the 1960s =The Sharpeville Massacre= In 1958 a group of disenchanted ANC members broke away from the ANC and formed the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC)in 1959. First on the PAC's agenda was a series of nationwide demonstrations against the pass laws. The PAC called for blacks to demonstrate against pass books on 21 March 1960. One of the mass demonstrations organised by the PAC took place at Sharpeville, a township near Vereeniging. Estimates of the size of the crowd is 20,000 people. The crowd converged on the Sharpeville police station, singing and offering themselves up for arrest for not carrying their pass books. A group of about 300 police panicked and opened fire on the demonstrators after the crowd trampled down the fence surrounding the police station. They killed 69 people and injured 186. All the victims were black, and most of them had been shot in the back. Many witnesses stated that the crowd was not violent, but Colonel J. Pienaar, the senior police officer in charge on the day, said, \\"Hordes of natives surrounded the police station. My car was struck with a stone. If they do these things they must learn their lesson the hard way\\". The event became known as the Sharpeville massacre. In its aftermath the government banned the African National Congress (ANC) and the PAC. List of attacks attributed to MK in South Africa between 1980 and 1983. =Beginning of the guerrilla campaign= The Sharpeville Massacre had the effect of persuading several anti-apartheid movements that nonviolent civil disobedience alone was ineffective at encouraging the National Party government to seek reform. The resurgent tide of armed revolutions in many developing nations and European colonial territories during the early 1960s had the effect of persuading ANC and PAC leaders that nonviolent civil disobedience should be complemented by acts of insurrection and sabotage. Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, were instrumental in persuading the ANC's executive to adopt armed struggle. Mandela had first advocated this option during the Defiance Campaign of 1952, but his proposal was rejected by his fellow activists as being too radical. However, with the subsequent success of revolutionary struggles in Cuba, French Indochina, and French Algeria, the ANC executive became increasingly more open to suggestions by Mandela and Sisulu that the time was ripe for armed struggle. From 1961 to 1963 the ground in South Africa was slowly being readied for armed revolution. A hierarchal network of covert ANC cells was created for underground operations, military aid solicited from sympathetic African states and the Soviet Union, and a guerrilla training camp established in Tanganyika. In June 1961 the Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) had been set up by the ANC to coordinate underground militant activity throughout South Africa. By the end of 1962 the ANC had established an MK high command consisting of Mandela, Sisulu, Govan Mbeki, Raymond Mhlaba, and prominent South African Communist Party (SACP) activist Joe Slovo. Slovo and the SACP were instrumental in bolstering MK and developing its tactics for guerrilla warfare, inciting insurrection, and urban sabotage. White SACP members such as Jack Hodgson, who had served in the South African Army during World War II, were instrumental in training MK recruits. The SACP was also able to secure promises of military aid from the Soviet Union for the fledging guerrilla army, and purchased Liliesleaf Farm in Rivonia, just outside Johannesburg, to serve as MK's headquarters. Throughout the 1960s, MK was still a relatively small unit of poorly equipped guerrilla fighters incapable of taking significant action against the South African security forces. Success of the MK's strategy hinged upon its ability to stoke the anger of a politically conscious black underclass and its armed struggle was essentially a strategic attempt at mass socialisation.This reflected the principles of Leninist vanguardism which heavily influenced SACP and to a lesser extent, ANC political theory. MK commanders hoped that through their actions, they could appeal to the masses and inspire a popular uprising against the South African regime. A popular uprising would compensate for the MK's weaknesses as it offered a way to defeat the National Party politically without having to engage in a direct military confrontation which the guerrillas would have no hope of winning. On December 16, 1961, MK operatives bombed a number of public facilities in several major South African cities, namely Johannesburg, Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, and Durban. This programme of controlled sabotage was timed to coincide with the Day of the Vow, the anniversary of an important battle between the voortrekkers and the Zulu Kingdom in 1838. Over the next eighteen months, MK carried out 200 acts of sabotage, mostly targeting pass offices, power pylons, and police stations.In October 1962 the ANC publicly declared responsibility for the sabotage campaign and acknowledged the existence of MK. Mandela began planning for MK members to be given military training outside South Africa and managed to slip past authorities as he himself moved in and out of the country, earning him the moniker \\"The Black Pimpernel\\". Mandela initially resisted arrest within South Africa, but in August 1962, after receiving some inside information, the police put up a roadblock and captured him. MK's success declined after this, and the police infiltrated the organisation. In July 1963, the police found the location of the MK headquarters at Lilliesleaf. In , they raided the farm and arrested many major leaders of the ANC and MK, including Walter Sisulu, Govan Mbeki and Ahmed Kathrada. They were detained and indicted with sabotage and attempting to bring down the government. At the same time, police collected evidence to be used in the trial, which enabled them to arrest other such people, like Denis Goldberg. Especially harmful was the information on Operation Mayibuye (Operation Comeback), a plan for bringing exiles back into the country. It also revealed that MK was planning to use guerrilla warfare. The PAC's secretive martial arm was called Poqo, meaning \\"go it alone\\". Poqo was prepared to take lives in the quest for liberation. It murdered whites, police informants and black people who supported the government. It sought to arrange a national revolution to conquer the white government, but poor organisation and in-house nuisances crippled the PAC and Poqo. The PAC did not have adequate direction. Many PAC principals were taken into custody on 21 March 1960, and those released were hampered by bans. When Robert Sobukwe (jailed following the Sharpeville massacre) was discharged from Robben Island in 1969, he was placed under house arrest in Kimberley until he died in 1978. Police repeatedly lengthened his incarceration through the \\"Sobukwe clause\\", which permitted the state to detain people even after they had served their sentences. The PAC's management difficulties also existed in exile. When they were outlawed, PAC leaders set up headquarters, in among places, Dar es Salaam, London and the United States. In 1962, Potlako Leballo left the country for Maseru, Basutoland, and became the PAC's acting president. Soon after he was elected as acting president, he make public statement that he will launch an attack to South African Police with an army of 150.000 cadres. A few days after that statement, he send two PAC women couriers, Cynthia Lichaba and Thabisa Lethala to post letters in Ladybrand, a South African town close Lesotho. The letters contained instructions and details of Poqo cadres. When Basutoland special branch intelligence in Maseru warned the South Africans that two female PAC couriers had crossed into South Africa to deliver letters. The two girl was arrested and Basutoland police confiscated correspondence addressed to poqo cells which was contained the address of the cell. A wave of arrests followed, and 3,246 PAC and Poqo members went to jail. In 1968, PAC was eventually expelled from Maseru (where it was allied to the opposition Basutoland Congress Party) and Zambia (which was friendlier to the ANC). All in all, MK ran a far more successful guerrilla campaign than Poqo. Between 1974 and 1976 Leballo and Ntantala trained the Lesotho Liberation Army (LLA) and Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA) in Libya. American pressures split the PAC into a \\"reformist-diplomatic\\" group under Sibeko, Make, and Pokela and a Maoist group under Leballo based in Ghana. APLA was destroyed by the Tanzanian military at Chunya on 11 March 1980 for refusing to accept the reformist-diplomatic leadership by Make. Leballo was influential in the South African 1985 student risings and pivotal in removing Leabua Jonathan's regime in Lesotho, the stress of which caused his death. The PAC never recovered from the 1980 massacre of Leballo's troops and his death and won a paltry 1.2% of the vote in the 1994 South African election. The widely publicised Rivonia Trial began in October 1963. Ten men stood accused of treason, trying to depose the government and sabotage. Nelson Mandela was tried, along with those arrested at Lilliesleaf and another 24 co-conspirators. Many of these people, however, had already fled the country, Tambo being but one. The ANC used the lawsuit to draw international interest to its cause. During the trial, Mandela gave his legendary \\"I am prepared to die\\" speech. In June 1964, eight were found guilty of terrorism, sabotage, planning and executing guerrilla warfare, and working towards an armed invasion of the country. The treason charge was dropped. All eight were sentenced to life imprisonment. They did not get the death penalty, as this hazarded too much international criticism. Goldberg was sent to the Pretoria Central Prison, and the other seven were all banished to the prison on Robben Island. Bram Fischer, the defence trial attorney, was himself arrested and tried shortly thereafter. The instructions that Mandela gave to make MK an African force were ignored: it continued to be organised and led by the SACP. The trial was condemned by the United Nations Security Council, and was a major force in the introduction of international sanctions against the South African government. After Sharpeville the ANC and PAC were banned. The South African Communist Party denied it existed, having dissolved in 1950 to escape banning as the CPSA. Leaders like Mandela and Sobukwe were either in jail or in exile.Consequently, there were serious mutinies in Angolan camps by Soweto and Cape student recruits angry at the corrupt and brutal consequences of minority control. By incarcerating leaders of MK and the ANC, the government was able to break the potency of the ANC within South Africa's borders, and greatly affect its efficiency outside of them. The ANC faced many problems in the aftermath of the Rivonia Trial, its inner administration cruelly afflicted. Thus, by 1964, the ANC went underground and began guerilla activities from bases abroad.At the end of the 1960s, new organisations and ideas would form to confront apartheid. The next key act of opposition would come only in 1976, however, with the Soweto uprising. The government's effort at defeating all opposition had been effective. The State of Emergency was de-proclaimed; the economy boomed; and the government began implementing apartheid by building the infrastructures of the ten separate Homelands, and relocating blacks into these homelands. In 1966, Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd was stabbed to death in parliament, but his policies continued under B.J. Vorster and later P.W. Botha. Black Consciousness Movement Prior to the 1960s, the NP government had been most effective in crushing anti-apartheid opposition within South Africa by outlawing movements like the ANC and PAC, and driving their leaders into exile or captivity. This planted the seeds for the struggle, particularly at such tertiary-education organisations as the University of the North and Zululand University. These institutions were fashioned out of the Extension of University Education Act of 1959, which guaranteed that black and white students would be taught individually and inequitably. After the banning of the ANC and PAC, and the Rivonia Trial, the struggle within South Africa had been dealt a stern blow. The age bracket that had seen the Sharpeville massacre had become apathetic in its gloom and despair. This changed in the late 1960s and most notably from the mid-1970s, when new devotion came from the latest, more radical generation. During this epoch, new anti-apartheid ideas and establishments were created, and they gathered support from across South Africa. The surfacing of the South African Black Consciousness Movement was influenced by its American equivalent, the American Black Power movement, and directors such as Malcolm X. African heads like Kenneth Kaunda also stirred ideas of autonomy and Black Pride by means of their anti-colonialist writings. Scholars grew in assurance and became far more candid about the NP's bigoted policies and the repression of the black people. During the 1970s, resistance gained force, first channelled through trade unions and strikes, and then spearheaded by the South African Students' Organisation, under the charismatic leadership of Steve Biko. A medical student, Biko was the main force behind the growth of South Africa's Black Consciousness Movement, which stressed the need for psychological liberation, black pride, and non-violent opposition to apartheid.Slightly more contentious was the movement's decision to stop working with white liberals in multi-racial organisations. Founded by Biko, the BC faction materialised out of the ideas of the civil rights movement and Black Power movement in the USA. The motto of the movement was \\"Black is Beautiful\\", first made popular by boxer Mohammed Ali. BC endorsed black pride and African customs, and did much to alter feelings of inadequacy, while also raising awareness of the fallacy of blacks being seen as inferior. It defied practices and merchandise that were meant to make black people \\"whiter\\", such as hair straighteners and skin lighteners. Western culture was toured as destructive and alien to Africa. Black people became conscious of their own distinctive identity and self-worth, and grew more outspoken about their right to freedom. The National Union of South African Students (NUSAS) was the first organisation to represent students in South Africa, but it had a principally white membership, and black students saw this as an impediment. White students had concerns more scholastic than political, and, although the administration was multi-racial, it was not tackling many of the issues of the mounting number of black students since 1960. This resulted in the 1967 creation of the University Christian Movement (UCM), an organisation rooted in African- American philosophy. In July 1967, the annual NUSAS symposium took place at Rhodes University in Grahamstown. White students were permitted to live on university grounds, but black students were relegated to accommodation further away in a church vestibule. This later led to the creation of the South African Students Organisation (SASO), under Steve Biko, in 1969. The Black Consciousness Movement (BCM) was an umbrella organisation for groups such as SASO. It was created in 1967, and among its members were the Azanian People's Organisation, the black Community Programme (which directed welfare schemes for blacks), the Black People's Convention (which, at first, attempted to unite charitable associations like that for the Education and Cultural Advancement of African People of South Africa) and the South African Students Movement (SASM), which represented high-school learners. The BPC finally expanded into a political administration, with Steve Biko as its honorary president. When the BCM's principles were illuminated, a number of fresh organisations, staunch in their endorsement of black liberation, came into being. The Azanian People's Organisation was only launched in 1978, a long time after the birth of the Black Consciousness Movement, as a medium for its message. The BCM drew most of its backing from high schools and tertiary institutions. Black Consciousness ethics were crucial in lifting consciousness amongst black people of their value and right to a better existence, along with the need to insist on these. The BCM's non-violent approach subsided in favour of a more radical element as its resolve to attain liberty was met with state hostility. After the carnage in Soweto the ANC's Nelson Mandela grudgingly concurred that bloodshed was the only means left to convince the NP to accede to commands for an end to its apartheid policy. A subversive plan of terror was mapped out, with Steve Biko and the BCM to the fore. The Black Consciousness Movement and other opinionated elements were prohibited during the 1970s because the government saw them as dangerous. Black Consciousness in South Africa adopted a drastic theory, much like socialism, as the liberation movement progressed to challenging class divisions and shifting from an ethnic stress to focusing more on non-racialism. The BCM became more worried about the destiny of the black people as workers, believing that \\"economic and political exploitation has reduced the black people into a class\\". With Black Consciousness increasing throughout black communities, a number of other organisations were formed to combat apartheid. In 1972, the Black People's Convention was founded, and the black Allied Worker's Union, formed in 1973, focused on black labour matters. The black community programmes gave attention to the more global issues of black communities. School learners began to confront the Bantu education policy, designed to prepare them to be second- class citizens. They created the South African Student's Movement (SASM). It was particularly popular in Soweto, where the 1976 insurrection against Bantu Education would prove to be a crossroads in the fight against apartheid. Taken into custody on 18 August 1977, Steve Biko was brutally tortured by unidentified security personnel until he lapsed into a coma. He went for three days without medical treatment and finally died in Pretoria. At the subsequent inquest, the magistrate ruled that no-one was to blame, but the South African Medical Association eventually took action against the doctors who had failed to treat Biko. There was tremendous reaction both within and outside South Africa. Foreign countries imposed even more stringent sanctions, and the United Nations imposed an arms embargo. Young blacks inside South Africa committed themselves even more fervently to the struggle against apartheid, under the catchphrase \\"Liberation before education\\". Black communities became highly politicised. The Black Consciousness Movement began to change its focus during the 1980s from being on issues of nation and community to issues of class and, perhaps as a result, had far less of an impact than in the mid-'seventies. Still, there is some evidence to suggest that it retained at least some influence, particularly in workers' organisations. The role of Black Consciousness could be clearly seen in the approach of the National Forum, which believed that the struggle ought to hold little or no place for whites. This ideal, of blacks leading the resistance campaign, was an important aim of the traditional Black Consciousness groups, and it shaped the thinking of many 'eighties activists, most notably the workforce. Furthermore, the NF focused on workers' issues, which became more and more important to BC supporters. The Azanian People's Organisation was the leading Black Consciousness group of the 1980s. It got most of its support from young black men and women—many of them educated at colleges and universities. The organisation had a lot of support in Soweto and also amongst journalists, helping to popularise its views. It focused, too, on workers' issues, but it refused to form any ties with whites. Although it did not achieve quite the same groundswell of support that it had in the late 1970s, Black Consciousness still influenced the thinking of a few resistance groups. Soweto uprising In 1974 the Afrikaans Medium Decree forced all black schools to use Afrikaans and English in a 50–50 mix as languages of instruction. The intention was to forcibly reverse the decline of Afrikaans among black Africans. The Afrikaner- dominated government used the clause of the 1909 Constitution that recognised only English and Afrikaans as official languages as pretext to do so. The decree was resented deeply by blacks as Afrikaans was widely viewed, in the words of Desmond Tutu, then Dean of Johannesburg as \\"the language of the oppressor\\". Teacher organisations such as the African Teachers Association of South Africa objected to the decree. The resentment grew until 30 April 1976, when children at Orlando West Junior School in Soweto went on strike, refusing to go to school. Their rebellion then spread to many other schools in Soweto. Students formed an Action Committee (later known as the Soweto Students' Representative Council) that organised a mass rally for 16 June 1976. The protest was intended to be peaceful. In a confrontation with police, who had barricaded the road along the intended route, stones were thrown. Attempts to disperse the crowd with dogs and tear gas failed; when the police saw they were surrounded by the students, they fired shots into the crowd, at which point pandemonium broke out. In the first day of rioting 23 people were killed in escalating violence. The following day 1,500 heavily armed police officers were deployed to Soweto. Crowd control methods used by South African police at the time included mainly dispersement techniques, and many of the officers shot indiscriminately, killing 176 people, most by police violence.16 June 1976 Student Uprising in Soweto. africanhistory.about.com Student organisations Student organisations played a significant role in the Soweto uprisings, and after 1976 protests by school children became frequent. There were two major urban school boycotts, in 1980 and 1983. Both involved black, Indian and coloured children, and both went on for months. There were also extended protests in rural areas in 1985 and 1986. In all of these areas, schools were closed and thousands of students, teachers and parents were arrested. =South African Students Movement= Students from Orlando West and Diepkloof High Schools (both in Soweto) created the African Students Movement in 1970. This spread to the Eastern Cape and Transvaal, drawing other high schools. In March 1972, the South African Students Movement (SASM) was instituted. SASM gave support to its members with school work and exams, and with progress from lower school levels to university. Security forces pestered its members continually until, in 1973, some of its leaders fled the country. In 1974 and 1975, some affiliates were captured and tried under the Suppression of Communism and Terrorism Acts. This flagged the SASM's progress. Many school headmasters and -mistresses forbade the organisation from playing a role in their schools. When the Southern Transvaal local Bantu Education Department concluded that all junior secondary black students had to be taught in Afrikaans in 1974, SASM limbs at Naledi High School and Orlando West Secondary Schools opted to vent their grievances on school books and refused to attend their schools This form of struggle spread fast to other schools in Soweto and hit boiling point around 8 June 1976. When law enforcement attempted to arrest a regional SASM secretary, they were stoned and had their cars torched. On 13 June 1976, nearly 400 SASM associates gathered and chose to start a movement for mass action. An Action Committee was shaped with two agents from each school in Soweto. This board became known as the Soweto Students' Representatives Council (SSRC). The protest was set aside for 16 June 1976, and the organisers were determined only to use aggression if they were assaulted by the police. =National Union of South African Students= After the Sharpeville Massacre, some black student organisations came out but were short-lived under state proscription and antagonism from university powers. They were also unsuccessful in co-operating effectively with one another, resulting in a dearth of harmony and force. By 1963, one of the few envoys for tertiary students was the National Union of South African Students (NUSAS). Although the organisation was meant to be non-racial and anti- government, it was made up primarily of white English students from customarily broad-minded universities such as those in Natal, Cape Town, the Witwatersrand and Grahamstown. These students were had compassion for the effort against the state. By 1967, however, NUSAS was forbidden from functioning on black universities, making it almost impossible for black Student Representative Councils to join the union. =South African Students Organisation= Growing displeasure among black students and the expansion of Black Consciousness led to the incarnation of the South African Students Organisation (SASO) at Turfloop. In July 1969, Steve Biko became the organisation's inaugural head. This boosted the mood of the students and the Black Consciousness Movement. By means of the unified configuration of SASO, the principles of Black Consciousness came to the forefront as a fresh incentive for the strugglers. =Congress of South African Students= The Congress of South African Students (COSAS) was aimed at co-ordinating the education struggle and organised strikes, boycotts and mass protests around community issues. After 1976 it made a number of demands from the Department of Education and Training (DET), including the scrapping of matric examination fees. It barred many DET officials from entering schools, demanded that all students pass their exams – \\"pass one, pass all\\"—and disrupted exams. =National Education Crisis Committee= In 1986, following school boycotts, the National Education Crisis Committee (NECC) was constituted from parents, teachers and students. It encouraged students to return to their studies, taking on forms of protest less disruptive to their education. Consumer boycotts were recommended instead and teachers and students were encouraged to work together to develop an alternative education system. Trade union movement Following the start of apartheid, South Africa was flourishing economically, due to its newly found trade relations. Products such as gold and coal were being traded along the nation's coastal lines, to western countries. The products being traded, were all mined by the black labour workers, who were split up by the Bantustan law. This law created different tribes of black South Africans, each who respectively would work in the same area and perform certain labour acts. This was strategic as it allowed the white people to direct labour easily. Respectively, in 1973 labour action in South Africa was renewed, as a result of the numerous strikes in Durban. Abuse of black workers was common, and, as a consequence, many black people were paid less than a living wage. In January, 2,000 workers of the Coronation Brick and Tile Company went on strike for a pay raise (from under R10 to R20 a week), incorporating Gandhis views of civil resistance into their rebellions. The strike drew a lot attention and encouraged other workers to strike. Strikes for higher wages, improved working conditions and the end of exploitation occurred throughout this period. Inspired by the brick and tile workers, other industrial and municipal workers followed in suit and walked off their jobs. A month later, 30,000 black labour workers were on strike in Durban alone. The entire apartheid system, relied on black labour workers to keep its economy growing, thus the strikes strategically disrupted the system of power. Not only did these strikes distort the nation's economy, they also inspired students to strike on their own. The Durban labour strikes were a foundation for multiple rebellions such as the ‘Soweto Uprising’. Police employed tear gas and violence against the strikers, but could not apprehend the masses of people involved. The strikers never chose individuals to stand for them, because these people would be the first to be detained. Blacks were not permitted trade unions, which meant that the government could not act against any particular individuals. Strikes usually concluded when income boosts were tendered, but these were generally lower than had initially been insisted upon. The Durban strikes soon extended to other parts of the country. 1973 and 1974 saw a countrywide amplification of labour opposition. There was also an increasingly buoyancy among black workers as they found that the state did not retort as harshly as they had expected. They thus began to form trade unions, even though these remained illegitimate and unofficial. After 1976, trade unions and their workers began to play a massive role in the fight against apartheid. With their thousands of members, the trade unions had great strength in numbers, and this they used to their advantage, campaigning for the rights of black workers and forcing the government to make changes to its apartheid policies. Importantly, trade unions filled the gap left by banned political parties. They assumed tremendous importance because they could act on a wide variety of issues and problems for their people—and not only work- related ones, as links between work issues and broader community grievances became more palpable. Fewer trade-union officials (harassed less by the police and army) were jailed than political leaders in the townships. Union members could meet and make plans within the factory. In this way, trade unions played a pivotal role in the struggle against apartheid, and their efforts generally had wide community support. In 1979, one year after Botha's accession to power, black trade unions were legalised, and their role in the resistance struggle grew to all-new proportions. Prior to 1979, black trade unions had had no legal clout in dealings with employers. All strikes that took place were illegal, but they did help to establish the trade unions and their collective cause. Although the legalisation of black trade unions gave workers the legal right to strike, it also gave the government a degree of control over them, as they all had to be registered and hand in their membership records to the government. They were not allowed to support political parties either, and it goes without saying that some trade unions did not comply. Later in 1979, the Federation of South African Trade Unions (FOSATU) was formed as the first genuinely national and non-racial trade union federation in South Africa. It was followed by the Council of Unions of South Africa (CUSA), which was influenced strongly by the ideas of Black Consciousness and wanted to work to ensure black leadership of unions. The establishment of the trade union federations led to greater unity amongst the workers. The tremendous size of the federations gave them increased voice and power. 1980 saw thousands of black high-school and university students boycotting their schools, and a country-wide protest over wages, rents and bus fares. In 1982, there were 394 strikes involving 141,571 workers. FOSATU and CUSA grew from a mere 70,000 members in 1979 to 320,000 by 1983, the year of the establishment of first the National Forum and then the UDF. Both of these had an important impact, but the latter was far more influential. With the establishment of the new constitution in 1984, the biggest and longest black uprising exploded in the Vaal Triangle. COSAS and FOSATU organised the longest stay-away in South African history, and, all told, there were 469 strikes that year, amounting to 378,000 hours in lost business time. In accordance with the State of Emergency in 1985, COSAS was banned and many UDF leaders arrested. A meeting between white business leaders and those of the ANC in Zambia brought about the formation of COSATU in 1985. The newly formed trade-union governing body, committed to improved working conditions and the fight against apartheid, organised a nationwide strike the following year, and a new State of Emergency was declared. It did not take long for COSATU's membership to grow to 500,000. With South Africa facing a neigh-unprecedented shortage of skilled white labour, the government was forced to allow black people to fill the vacancies. This, in turn, led to an increase in spending on black, coloured and Indian education. Still, there were divides amongst the trade-union faction, which had the membership of only ten per cent of the country's workforce. Not all trade unions joined the federations, while agricultural and domestic workers did not even have a trade union to join and were thus more liable. Nevertheless, by the end of this period, the unions had emerged as one of the most effective vehicles for black opposition. Churches The government's suppression of anti-Apartheid political parties limited their influence but not church activism. The government was far less likely to attack or arrest religious leaders, allowing them to potentially be more politically active in the struggle. The government did, however, take action against some churches. Beyers Naudé left the pro-apartheid Dutch Reformed Church and founded the Christian Institute of Southern Africa with other theologians, including Albert Geyser, Ben Marais and John de Gruchy. Naudé, along with the Institute, were banned in 1977, but he later became the general secretary of the South African Council of Churches (SACC), a religious association that supported anti-apartheid activities. Significantly, it also refused to condemn violence as a means of ending apartheid. Frank Chikane was another general secretary of the SACC. He was detained four times because of his criticism of the government and once allegedly had an attempt on his life, initiated by Adriaan Vlok, former Minister of Law and Order. The charismatic Archbishop Desmond Tutu was yet another general secretary of the SACC. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in 1984 and used his position and popularity to denounce the government and its policies. On 29 February 1988 Tutu, and a number of other church leaders, were arrested during a protest in front of the parliamentary buildings in Cape Town.\\"Tutu, Other Clergy Arrested in Protest\\", The Harvard Crimson, 1 March 1988. Alan Boesak led the World Alliance of Reformed Churches (WARC). He was very influential in founding the UDF and was once jailed for a month after organising a march demanding the release of Nelson Mandela. Although church leaders were not totally immune to prosecution, they were able to criticise the government more freely than the leaders of militant groups. They were pivotal in altering public opinion regarding apartheid policies. A 1977 New York Times article reported that the Catholic Church in South Africa had caught up and in fact surpassed Protestant Churches by authorizing the admission of black students to previously all- white schools. This was done in disregard of South African law which required segregation. Protestant churches such as the Anglicans had generally followed a conciliatory approach of attempting to gain prior government approval. The Catholics also announced they were laying the groundwork to extend their approach to hospitals, homes and orphanages. In contrast, the Dutch Reformed Church still offered biblical justifications for segregation in 1977, although some reformers within this denomination challenged that.New York Times (archives), \\"Catholic Defiance of Apartheid Is Stirring South Africa,\\" John Burns, Feb. 6, 1977. Mass Democratic Movement The Mass Democratic Movement played a brief but very important role in the struggle. Formed in 1989, it was made up of an alliance between the UDF and COSATU, and organised a campaign aimed at ending segregation in hospitals, schools and beaches. The campaign proved successful and managed to bring segregation to an end. Some historians, however, argue that this occurred because the government had planned to end segregation anyway and did not, therefore, feel at all threatened by the MDM's action. Later in 1989, the MDM organised a number of peaceful marches against the State of Emergency (extended to four years now) in the major cities. Even though these marches were illegal, no-one was arrested—evidence that apartheid was coming to an end and that the government's hold was weakening. The MDM emerged only very late into the struggle, but it added to the effective resistance that the government faced. It organised a series of protests and further united the opposition movement. Certainly, it was characteristic of the \\"mass resistance\\" that characterised the 'eighties: many organisations united, dealing with different aspects of the fight against apartheid and its implications. White resistance While the majority of white South African voters supported the apartheid system for the first few decades, a minority fervently opposed it. Although assassination attempts against government members were rare, Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd, called the \\"architect of grand apartheid\\", suffered two attempts on his life (the second of which was successful) on the hands of David Pratt and Dimitri Tsafendas, both legally considered white (although Tsafendas had a mother from Portuguese East Africa). The moderate United Party of Jan Smuts (the official opposition in 1948–1977) initially opposed the Nationalists' programme of apartheid, having favoured the dismantling of racial segregation by the Fagan Commission, but eventually came to revert its policy and even criticised the NP government for \\"handing out\\" too much South African land to the bantustans. In parliamentary elections during the 1970s and 1980s between 15% and 20% of white voters voted for the liberal Progressive Party, whose main champion Helen Suzman for many years constituted the only MP consistently voting against apartheid legislation. Suzman's critics argue that she did not achieve any notable political successes, but helped to shore up claims by the Nationalists that internal, public criticism of apartheid was permitted. Suzman's supporters point to her use of her parliamentary privileges to help the poorest and most disempowered South Africans in any way she could. Harry Schwarz was in minority opposition politics for over 40 years and was one of the most prominent opponents of the National Party and its policy of apartheid. After assisting in the 1948 general election, Schwarz and others formed the Torch Commando, an ex-soldiers' movement to protest against the disenfranchisement of the coloured people in South Africa. Beginning in the 1960s, when he was Leader of the Opposition in the Transvaal, he became well-known and achieved prominence as a race relations and economic reformist in the United Party. An early and powerful advocate of non-violent resistance, he signed the Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith with Mangosuthu Buthelezi in 1974, that enshrined the principles of peaceful negotiated transition of power and equality for all, the first of such agreements by black and white political leaders in South Africa. In 1975 he led a break away from the United Party, due to its lame duck approach to criticism of apartheid and became leader of the new Reform Party that led to the realignment of opposition politics in South Africa. Schwarz was one of the defence attorneys in the infamous Rivonia Trial, defending Jimmy Kantor, who was Nelson Mandela's lawyer until he too was arrested and charged. Through the 1970s and 1980s in Parliament he was amongst the most forthright and effective campaigners against apartheid, who was feared by many National Party ministers. Helen Zille, a white anti- apartheid activist, exposed a police cover-up regarding the death of Black Consciousness founder Steve Biko as a reporter for the Rand Daily Mail. Zille was active in the Black Sash, an organisation of white women formed in 1955 to oppose the removal of Coloured (mixed-race) voters from the Cape Province voters' roll. Even after that failure, however, it went on assisting blacks with issues such as pass laws, housing and unemployment. Covert resistance was expressed by banned organisations like the largely white South African Communist Party, whose leader Joe Slovo was also Chief of Staff of the ANC's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe. Whites also played a significant role in opposing apartheid during the 1980s through the United Democratic Front and End Conscription Campaign. The latter was formed in 1983 to oppose the conscription of white males into the South African military. The ECC's support-base was not particularly large, but the government still saw fit to ban it 1988. The army played a major role in the government's maintenance of its apartheid policies. It was expanded considerably to fight the resistance, and more money was being spent on increasing its effectiveness. It is estimated that something between R4-billion and R5-billion was spent on defence in the mid-'eighties. Conscription was used to increase the size of the army, with stiff prison sentences imposed for draft evasion or desertion. Only white males were conscripted, but volunteers from other races were also drawn in. The army was used to fight battles on South African borders and in neighbouring states, against the liberation movements and the countries that supported them. During the 1980s, the military was also used to repress township uprisings, which saw support for the ECC increase markedly. Cultural opposition to apartheid came from internationally known writers like Breyten Breytenbach, André Brink and Alan Paton (who co-founded the Liberal Party of South Africa) and clerics like Beyers Naudé. Some of the first violent resistance to the system was organised by the African Resistance Movement (ARM) who were responsible for setting off bombs at power stations and notably the Park Station bomb. The membership of this group was virtually all drawn from the marginalised white intellectual scene. Founded in the 1960s, many of ARM's members had been part of the National Union of South African Students (NUSAS). Unlike pro-peace opposition NUSAS, however, ARM was a radical organisation. Its backing came mostly from Johannesburg, Port Elizabeth and Cape Town. By 1964, though, ARM ceased to exist, most of its members having been arrested or fled the country. On 24 July 1964, Frederick John Harris, an associate of ARM, deposited a time bomb in the Johannesburg station. One person was slain, and 22 were injured. Harris explained that he had wanted to show that ARM was still in existence, but both ARM and the ANC slammed his actions. He was sentenced to death and executed in 1965. Jewish resistance Many Jewish South Africans, both individuals and organisations, helped support the anti-apartheid movement. It was estimated that Jews were disproportionately represented (some sources maintain by as much as 2,500%) among whites involved in anti-apartheid political activities. Much like other English-speaking white South Africans, Jews supported either the Progressive Party or the United Party. One organisation, the Union of Jewish Women, sought to alleviate the suffering of blacks through charitable projects and self-help schemes. Fourteen of the 23 whites involved in the 1956 Treason Trial were Jewish and all five whites of the 17 members of the African National Congress who were arrested for anti-apartheid activities in 1963 were Jewish. Some Jewish university students vehemently opposed the apartheid movement. A large number of Jews were also involved in organisations such as the Springbok Legion, the Torch Commando, and the Black Sash. These anti-apartheid organisations led protests that were both active (i.e. marching through the streets with torches) and passive (i.e. standing silently in black). Two Jewish organisations were formed in 1985: Jews for Justice (in Cape Town) and Jews for Social Justice (in Johannesburg) tried to reform South African society and build bridges between the white and black communities. Also in 1985, the South African Jewish Board passed a resolution rejecting apartheid.Jewish opposition to the Apartheid Regime In addition to the well- known high profile Jewish anti-apartheid personalities, there were very many ordinary Jews who expressed their revulsion of apartheid in diverse ways and contributed to its eventual downfall. Many Jews were active in providing humanitarian assistance for black communities. Johannesburg's Oxford Synagogue and Cape Town's Temple Israel established nurseries, medical clinics and adult education programs in the townships and provided legal aid for victims of apartheid laws. Many Jewish lawyers acted as nominees for non-whites who were not allowed to buy properties in white areas. In 1980, South Africa's National Congress of the Jewish Board of Deputies passed a resolution urging \\"all concerned [people] and, in particular, members of our community to cooperate in securing the immediate amelioration and ultimate removal of all unjust discriminatory laws and practices based on race, creed, or colour.\\" This inspired some Jews to intensify their anti-apartheid activism, but the bulk of the community either emigrated or avoided public conflict with the National Party government. The Jews of Africa Indian resistance Hilda Kuper, writing in 1960, observed of the Natal Indian Congress: Fatima Meer was notable among South African anti-apartheid activists from the Indian diaspora. Role of women South African women greatly participated in the anti- apartheid and liberation movements that took hold of South Africa. These female activists were rarely at the head of the main organisations, at least at the beginning of the movement, but were nonetheless prime actors. One of the earliest organisation was The Bantu Women's League founded in 1913.Bernstein, Hilda. For their Triumphs and for their Tears: Women in Apartheid South Africa(International Defense and Aid Fund for Southern Africa. Revised and enlarged edition, London, March 1985), p. 86. In the 1930s and 1940s, female activists were strongly present in trade union movements, which also served as a vehicle for future organisation. In the 1950s, organisations specifically for women were created such as the ANC Women's League (ANCWL) or the Women's Council within the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO).Lachick and Urdang, p. 110. In April 1954, the more global Federation of South African Women (FSAW or FedSAW) was founded with the objective to fight against racism and oppression of women as well as to make African women understand that they had rights both as human beings and as women. While female activists fought along men and participated to demonstrations and guerrilla movements, FSAW and ANCWL also acted independently and organised bus boycotts, campaigns against restrictive passes in 1956 in Pretoria and in Sharpeville in 1960.Rob Davies, Dan O'Meara and Sipho Dlamini, The Struggle For South Africa: A Reference Guide to Movements, Organizations and Institutions. Volume Two (London: Zed Books, 1984), p. 366. 20,000 women attended these kind of demonstrations. Many participants were arrested, forced into exile or imprisoned, including such as Lilian Ngoyi. In 1958, 2000 women were arrested during an anti-pass campaign.Bernstein, p. 96. After the Sharpeville massacre, however, many organisations such as FSAW were banned and went underground. At the same time South African women fought against gender discrimination and called for rights specific to women, such as family, children, gender equality and access to education. At a conference in Johannesburg in 1954, the Federation of South African Women adopted the \\"Women's Charter\\",ANC/FSAW, Women's Charter. which focused on rights specific to women both as women and mothers. The Charter referred both to human rights, women's rights and asked for universal equality and national liberation. In 1955, in a document drafted in preparation for the Congress of People,ANC/FSAW, What Women Want , Compiled in Preparation for the Congress of the People, 1955. the FSAW made more demands, including free education for children, proper housing facilities and good working conditions, such as the abolition of child labour and a minimum wage. The difficulty for these local movements was to raise global awareness to truly have an impact. Yet, their actions and demands gradually attracted the attention of the United Nations and put pressure on the international community. In 1954, Lilian Ngoyi attended the World Congress of Women in Lausanne, Switzerland.ANC official website, Lilian Nogyi Later, in 1975, the ANC was present at the 1975 United Nations Decade for Women in Copenhagen and in 1980 an essay on the role of women in the liberation movementANC, Secretariat for the World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women. The Role of Women in the Struggle Against Apartheid, 1980. was prepared for the United Nations World Conference. This has been crucial in the recognition of Southern African women and their role in the anti-apartheid movement. Among important activists during the anti- apartheid movement were Ida Mntwana, Lilian Ngoyi, Helen Joseph, and Dorothy Nyembe.Bernstein, pp. 100–101. Lilian Ngoyi joined the ANC National Executive and was elected first vice-president and later president of FSAW in 1959. Many of these leaders served long prison sentences.

The series was created by Jeremy Brock and Paul Unwin. It is set in the fictional Holby City Hospital, in the equally fictitious city of Holby, and features occasional crossovers of characters and plots with spin-off show Holby City. Casualty follows the professional and personal lives of the doctors, nurses, paramedics, hospital management and patients at Holby General. It features an ensemble cast of regular characters, and began with 10 main characters in its first series, all but one – Charlie Fairhead (played by Derek Thompson) have since left the series. Many main characters have been written in and out of the series since. In addition, Casualty features guest stars each week, as well as recurring guests that take part in story arcs that span a portion of a series or multiple series. Main characters =A= Jez Andrews Jez Andrews, played by Lloyd Everitt, made his first screen appearance on 12 March 2016. The character and Everitt's casting was announced on 29 January 2016, whilst further details announced on 24 February 2016 with the casting of David Hide (Jason Durr) and Elle Gardner (Jaye Griffiths). Executive producer Oliver Kent described the three castings as \\"wonderful\\" and said their storylines would be \\"brilliantly vibrant, bold and gripping\\". Jez is characterised as a \\"young, ludicrously handsome and very openly bisexual\\" paramedic. Kent teased the dynamic between Jez and his paramedic colleague, Iain Dean (Michael Stevenson), calling it \\"fun\\" and \\"unlike anything we’ve seen before\\". Tasha Hegarty of Digital Spy described Jez as \\"Iain's new partner in crime\\". It was announced that Jez would \\"fail to impress\\" Iain with his \\"cheeky banter and lax attitude\\" upon his arrival, and would struggle to replace Iain's former colleague, Dixie Dixon (Jane Hazlegrove). Kent also revealed that a \\"big\\" friendship would be established between Jez and Max Walker (Jamie Davis). Everitt had already filmed his first scenes when his casting was announced and revealed that his favourite thing to film had been a scene where he rescued a girl from falling from a cliff, \\"I actually felt it was a real life situation and that excited me.\\" Of his casting, Everitt said, \\"I feel honoured to be joining such a successful show and look forward to bringing a different essence to a programme that's synonymous with British culture and television. It's actually the first programme I remember watching when I was a child at my Nan's house - there's a great beauty to that.\\" Jez arrived and tried flirting with Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing) until his colleague, Iain Dean (Michael Stevenson), revealed she was the department's clinical lead. Jez and Iain escorted Emilie Groome (Carol Royle) to a hospice, where she would spend her final days. They stop the ambulance during the journey whilst her sons and doctors, Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford) and Caleb Knight (Richard Winsor), treat her. Jez allows Cal to steal the ambulance so he can take Emilie to the seaside. Jez then spends the rest of the day trying to impress Iain with his banter whilst they search for a lift back to the hospital. Jez finally wins Iain over and they receive a lift back to the hospital. Jez installs a basketball hoop in the ambulance bay and befriends Max Walker (Jamie Davis), who often spends time playing basketball with Jez. Max and Robyn Miller (Amanda Henderson) then begin renting a room to Jez. Jez went on a night out with Isaac Mayfield, after he had a row with boyfriend Dominic Copeland resulting in a one-night stand. This eventually leads to Mayfield physically, sexually and emotionally abusing Copeland in sister show Holby City, resulting in his dismissal. He later pursues Louise Tyler (Azuka Oforka) and, although she tells him she is uncomfortable knowing he has been with both men and women, he eventually wins her over and the two go on a date. He later expresses concerns to Iain that he thinks Louise expects too much after she invites him to an expensive restaurant. He bails on their date, wanting to avoid being embarrassed because he can't afford any of the food and hooks up with a guy. To his horror, Jez wakes up in the young man's bed and discovers that he is Elle's son. He is injured after falling from Elle's drainpipe in his attempt to hide from her. Her son later visits the hospital to give Jez his ID which he had left behind, leading Elle to find out about them sleeping together. Although angry at first, Elle eventually calms down and tells Jez to use the front door next time he wants to stay over. When Roy Ellisson is brought into the ED following a fight, he abuses Jez in the ambulance for being black and \\"queer\\". Jez later reveals that he knows the man Roy was fighting with from bars in town. He tries to support Mickey Ellisson after discovering that he is gay and helps him apologize to the man his father beat up. He encourages Mickey to come out and provides reassurance when Roy rejects him. After his father dies, Mickey goes to see Jez at the ambulance station and the two share a kiss. Jez and Mickey commence a relationship, keeping it a secret from Mickey's family. Mickey participates in a race-related assault on a shopkeeper and is injured during the getaway, landing him back in the ED. When Mickey is almost discovered, he racially insults Jez to demonstrate his loyalty to his brother. Grieving and seething with injustice, Ethan reveals Mickey's relationship to Scott. Scott goes to attack Jez, but Mickey shields him and says he made the wrong choice. Scott attacks them with a knife, and in the struggle is tossed over a second floor balcony, leaving him badly injured. Denise arrives and disowns Mickey, and Scott later dies. The 'shot-in-one-take' episode \\"One\\" opens with Jez bravely dragging a Korean woman from a burning building. He finds out that her baby was left behind in the building, which leaves him devastated. This event completely shatters Jez's confidence and he begins to take sick days from work. He freezes up when a fire is started in his apartment and Robyn tries to pass him her baby. Because of the timing of the fire, it is concluded that Jez was targeted in the attack, and that Denise Ellisson was involved. This event is the last straw for Mickey who says he is going travelling and invites Jez to come with him so they can escape everything and start anew. Jez wonders what he has to lose at this point and considers joining him, but when he reacts quickly and saves Robin's baby from choking, he appears to be at peace with staying at Holby. After a talk with Iain he changes his mind and meets Mickey at the airport. The Holby staff later receive photographs of the couple relaxing in Mexico. Linda Andrews Linda Andrews, played by Christine Tremarco, made her debut appearance in the twentieth episode of the twenty-fourth series, broadcast on 16 January 2010. Linda was originally introduced to aid the departure of Jessica Harrison (Gillian Kearney), who she trained to be a nurse with. Linda told Jessica that she is moving to America and \\"almost flippant remarked\\" that Jessica join her, which she agreed to. Tremarco reprised the role as a regular cast member in 2011 and Linda returned to the hospital as a clinical nurse manager, but was later demoted to staff nurse. She was billed as a \\"fun-loving nurse\\" who is \\"determined to become more sensible.\\" Tremarco said she was \\"delighted\\" to be invited back to the show, adding that it was \\"so exciting joining a long-running show\\" and how \\"everyone has given me such a warm welcome\\". To prepare for the role, Tremarco observed a real nurse, who \\"was incredibly helpful\\" because she is a \\"squeamish person\\". Tremarco described Linda as \\"a party girl\\" with an \\"attitude that she’s young free and single\\". She added that she was \\"fun and outgoing\\", but had \\"a heart of gold\\" and would \\"do anything for anyone.\\" The show introduced Linda's family in 2012, beginning with her \\"recovering drug addict\\" sister Denise Andrews (Kate McEvoy) who hasn't had \\"any contact in years\\". Of Denise's introduction, producer Nikki Wilson said, \\"Denise suddenly arrives with two kids in tow, and leaves them with Linda. So party girl Linda finds herself responsible for two children - which will affect her working life in a big way.\\" Wilson also teased a possible romance between Linda and Lenny Lyons (Steven Miller), noting that they have a \\"really sparky relationship\\". The character departed from the series in the thirty-fifth episode of the twenty-seventh series, broadcast on 11 May 2013. The exit had only been revealed through advanced spoilers beforehand. Martin \\"Ash\\" Ashford Patrick Robinson (pictured) reprised his role as Martin \\"Ash\\" Ashford in 2013 after a 15-year absence. Martin \\"Ash\\" Ashford, played by Patrick Robinson, is introduced in the first episode of series 5, first broadcast on 7 September 1990. Ash left on 24 February 1996, but returned on 21 February 1998 for two episodes. It was announced on 3 February 2013, that Robinson has returned to Casualty and would make his first appearance on 9 February 2013. He would be filling the gap left since Michael French's departure as Nick Jordan. Speaking of his return, Robinson said; \\"It's fantastic to be back! Recreating a character that has moved on and changed so much is incredibly challenging and this feels like a totally new job. But to be back working with Derek Thompson, I feel like I've come home.\\" Executive producer, Jonathan Young added; \\"We're thrilled to have Patrick back. Ash was a hugely popular character and reuniting him with Charlie will reignite a friendship that we hope will delight viewers old and new. With many years of nursing under his belt plus a stint working as a doctor in America, Ash brings a unique perspective to the ED that will challenge Zoe but charm the rest of the team.\\" Robinson made his final appearance in the series in December 2014 and in the following month, it was explained that Ash had left. Robinson confirmed in March 2018 that it was not his decision to leave and that producers had decided not to renew his contract, which disappointed him. He told Tess Lamacraft of What's on TV that people approach him to ask what happened to Ash, since he did not receive an exit storyline. Ash joined the hospital as a staff nurse and was promoted to senior staff nurse in series 7. When Lisa \\"Duffy\\" Duffin (Cathy Shipton) left the hospital, Ash became a charge nurse later on. He was suspended from the hospital when a racist thug that threatened him with a knife accuses him of assault, but was acquitted when Matt Hawley (Jason Merrells) admits he overheard the man threatening Ash. Ash continued his role of charge nurse until his departure. Ash returned to the ED in 2013 as a locum consultant, who was eventually given a permanent place within the hospital. During his original stint in the ED, Ash had friendships with Kelly Liddle (Adie Allen) and Charlie Fairhead (Thompson). He is devastated when Kelly commits suicide and becomes Charlie's 'right-hand man'. When Ash returned to the ED in 2013, he renewed his friendship with Charlie, whilst also befriending clinical lead Zoe Hanna (Sunetra Sarker) and later, staff nurse Rita Freeman (Chloe Howman). Ash has also been involved in several relationships. He was shown to be living with his girlfriend, Nikki Wyatt, in series 7, but they separated when she had an abortion. Ash was later shown to have feelings for his new flatmate Mie Nishi-Kawa (Naoko Mori), but she left Holby before their relationship could develop. Ash married the hospital's PR officer Laura Milburn (Lizzy McInnerny) in the series 10 finale and they left Holby together following this. During his 1998 return, Ash confirmed he and Laura had a daughter and were separated. His 2013 return brought him into conflict with Zoe upon his return, but they later became friends. He quickly made an impression on his colleagues when he attended a motorbike crash on the way to his first shift. Zoe left Ash in charge of the emergency department when she became ill and he took to the challenge well. Ash's daughter, Ella Ashford (Tahirah Sharif) was introduced in April 2013 when she was admitted into the ED. Ash is shown to deeply love Ella, despite her trouble-making attitude. He does later recognise Ella's faults and begins punishing her for her irresponsible actions. Ash later discovers that Ella had an affair with her maths teacher, resulting in his decision to have Ella stay with him permanently. Ella later steals ketamine from Ash's emergency medical equipment and when she shows no remorse for her actions, despite her boyfriend dying under the influence, Ash reports her to the police who arrested her. Ash was assigned F2 doctor Lily Chao (Crystal Yu) as a mentee in August 2013 and becomes disgusted by her bedside manner. Ash warns Lily about her behaviour when she performs a life-threatening operation on a patient in cubicles. When a pregnant woman with down's syndrome is admitted, Lily and Ash are tasked with treating her. Lily becomes attached to the patient and performs another risky operation on her without permission. Ash is furious with her and informs her that her patient died when she had, in fact, gone to the maternity ward. When she discovers the truth, Lily files a formal complaint against Ash and despite persuasion from Zoe to rethink her decision, she decides to make the complaint. They later attend a meeting with the hospital's CEO Guy Self (John Michie) who decides that Lily should not have performed the operation without the permission of Ash or Charlie and Ash is given a written warning for his behaviour. Ash becomes a support for Rita when her paedophile husband is admitted into the ED, resulting in her to begin excessive drinking. When he discovers Rita drinking at work, he sends her home but is left with the choice of telling her boss the truth. Ash (along with colleagues Lily, Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing), Tess Bateman (Suzanne Packer) and Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford)) are involved in a road collision, where Ash becomes trapped in the vehicle. He insists his colleagues are to be saved before himself and following that, paramedics Jeff Collier (Matt Bardock) and Kathleen \\"Dixie\\" Dixon (Jane Hazlegrove) attempt to rescue him from the vehicle. They discover metal stuck in his leg which Jeff resolves to pull out in order to stop Ash from bleeding out. This allows Dixie and firemen to retrieve out of the vehicle, but as they get to the ambulance, the vehicle explodes with Jeff inside. Jeff's death began affecting Ash, who develops survivor's guilt which has serious effects on his work. Dixie blames Ash for Jeff's death and after a series of arguments, Dixie tells Ash that he should have died in the explosion and not Jeff. Ash continues to react angrily when a Jehovah's Witness refuses to receive a blood transfusion and when two teenagers constantly put themselves in danger. Ash's boss, Connie, demands he attend counselling which he doesn't enjoy. The counsellor, Ben Harding (Mark Letheren), suggests that Jeff chose to save Ash because he believed Ash was worth saving prompting him to turn his life around and honour Jeff's wishes by correctly doing his job. He also talks to Dixie who apologises for blaming Ash. However, Ben's words cause Ash to become obsessed with saving lives to honour Jeff and is eventually convinced to take leave from work. Off-screen, Ash chooses to resign from his job in order to concentrate on Ella who had been released from prison. Lloyd Asike Michael Obiora appeared in the show as nurse Lloyd Asike for two years. Lloyd Asike played by Michael Obiora is a staff nurse who first appeared on 20 August 2011, alongside Scarlett Conway (Madeleine Mantock). Lloyd and Scarlett's casting were revealed in an interview that Digital Spy published with executive producer, Oliver Kent on 6 July 2011. Lloyd left Casualty on 8 June 2013 after deciding to retrain as a doctor. Upon his arrival, Lloyd was mentored by Jay Faldren (Ben Turner) and it slowly becomes clear that Lloyd has feelings for Scarlett and following the massive fire at the hospital, he admits his feelings to her and they begin a relationship. Their relationship ends abruptly when she hands herself in for throwing a brick at a police officer during the Holby Riots. His mum, Florence and sister, Shelia appear towards the end of series 26. In an interview with Digital Spy in 2011, producer Oliver Kent announced the casting of Michael Obiora as Lloyd Asike. Obiora's casting was announced at the same time as Scarlett Conway (Madeleine Mantock). He said, \\"We're bringing in two new nurses at the start of the new series - Lloyd Asike and Scarlett Conway. We're very excited about the castings. Lloyd is played by the brilliant Michael Obiora, who viewers will probably know from Hotel Babylon, EastEnders and Grange Hill. He's phenomenal.\\" In 2012, producer Nikki Harris spoke to Inside Soap about whether Lloyd was going to have a relationship with Scarlett. She said, \\"I couldn't possibly say yet - just keep watching! What's interesting about the pair of characters is the question of identity. Lloyd is from a very strong, cultural black background and is very rooted in his origins, whereas Scarlett was brought up in a white family. So we're really interested in exploring the two differences in identity between the two.\\" =B= Mike Barratt Mike Barratt, played by Clive Mantle, made his first appearance during the seventh series. Mike was a consultant, who formed a relationship with staff nurse Rachel Longworth (Jane Gurnett). He became a popular member of the cast and was branded a \\"heart-throb\\". Mantle left at the end of series eleven, but briefly returned during the following series. Of his decision to leave the show, Mantle said \\"I didn't want to see the audience always expecting him to be there and perhaps taking less notice of him. I've had a great time, but I'm frightened that, if I stick around too long, I'll end up unable to do anything else.\\" The character later appeared in sister show Holby City between 1999 and 2001, as a consultant general surgeon. Mantle reprised his role for the 30th anniversary episode \\"Too Old for This Shift\\", which aired in August 2016. Tess Bateman Tess Bateman, played by Suzanne Packer, is a ward sister who first appeared on 13 September 2003. From her arrival until 2005, Tess was an emergency nurse practitioner and following that, she was promoted to clinical nurse manager for six years, until 2011. In May 2011, Tess resigned from her position and resumed the role of ward sister, but was later reinstated. Tess continued in the role until January 2015 when she resigned to help set up a new health centre as a secondment, returning as a ward sister shortly after. Packer chose to leave the role in 2015, with Tess departing on 22 August 2015. Tess left Holby to live in Leeds with her son and grandson. Packer reprised her role for the 30th anniversary episode \\"Too Old for This Shift\\", which aired in August 2016. Connie Beauchamp Constance \\"Connie\\" Beauchamp played by Amanda Mealing, originally appeared in Casualty's spin off show, Holby City, in the role of Cardiothoracic Consultant and Clinical Lead of Holby's Darwin Cardiothoracic Ward. Connie later went on to become Director of Surgery and Medical Director of Holby City Hospital. During this period, she appeared in the first two crossovers between Casualty and Holby City, featuring the casts of both shows, and made a guest appearance in the Casualty episode shown 9 September 2007. She departed from the show in its thirteenth series, resigning from her post. Her return was announced on 23 July 2013 and she arrived in Casualty on 29 March 2014. Big Mac Mackenzie \\"Big Mac\\" Chalker played by Charles Dale first appeared on 24 November 2007. He was a porter until October 2013, when he applied to become an emergency care assistant. However, he quit this role in November 2014 and applied to be a healthcare assistant instead. He hasn't changed his job role since. Dale's departure was announced on 7 June 2016, after eight and a half years on the show. Big Mac's exit airs on 11 June 2016 when he decides to leave Holby.Charles Dale to Leave Holby.tv Dale since revealed he would return for a cameo appearance in the show's thirtieth anniversary specials. Big Mac is a veteran of the Falklands War of 1982, where many of his fellow soldiers were killed while he survived. This has led to him experiencing intense feelings of guilt. The BBC describe him as \\"overly sensitive\\" and \\"just a little bit grouchy\\". An episode of series 23 devoted to the character sees him assume a vigilante role on the city's Farmead Estate. Dale states that the episode causes Mac to realise: \\"it's time he stood up for himself and that he can't run from things that happened in the past all his life.\\" Describing Mac's personality, Dale appraised that Mac is \\"deeply introverted\\" and struggles to accept that his colleagues actually like him. He explained that although Mac occasionally acts pompously, this approach is \\"a mask that he puts on to keep people at distance when he gets afraid or embarrassed\\". He expanded that Mac has: \\"been scared to go out and he's terrified of life. But because of people in the hospital he's slowly discovering it.\\" Mac has a budding friendship with Noel Garcia (Tony Marshall) and Louise Tyler (Azuka Oforka). When paramedic Dixie Dixon (Jane Hazlegrove) mentioned to Louise and Mac that they were looking for a new Emergency Care Assistant, Mac showed interest and Louise completed an application on Mac's behalf. Mac was given the job and spent a day training Max Walker (Jamie Davis) to be a porter in the ED. He has also supported paramedic Iain Dean through traumatic events. In September 2012, Mac became the centre of a big storyline which saw him suffer a major heart attack. Mac survived the heart attack, and according to Dale, the storyline gave Mac \\"a new lease of life.\\". Later in March 2014, Mac was held hostage alongside Iain and attacked in the ambulance bay by one of Iain's army colleagues, Kenny Archer. Mac made a full recovery and returned to work. In October 2014, following the death Jeff Collier (Matt Bardock), Mac asks for a transfer back to the ED, where he becomes a healthcare assistant. Noel was attacked in January 2016 and whilst the attack took place, Mac hid in a nearby toilet. Noel is left seriously injured, but recovers and is left under the impression that Mac fought the attacker off. Subsequently, Noel does various good gestures for Mac including buying Mac a new motorbike. Mac continues to live with the guilt of his cowardice, whilst the attacker Mercedes Christie (Hannah Spearitt) regularly visits Mac and blackmails him in return for drugs. The investigating officers discover the truth and Mac is publicly taken away for questioning, causing him to be remonstrated by several members of the ED staff. Noel discovers the truth and ends their friendship, moving out of their apartment. The two men bicker needlessly at work until Jack Diamond (Alistair Brammer) and Robyn Miller (Amanda Henderson) lock them in a room together. Mac explains that he panicked and now felt deeply ashamed about his actions. Noel forgives him and agrees to move back in. Mac realises that Mercedes is a deeply troubled woman and is sympathetic towards her. When Mac loses his pain medication, he grows irritable and steals painkillers from a pharmacy order he is asked to make. Mercedes catches him doing so and steals the drugs for herself. When the pharmacy reports a stock inconsistency, the suspicion of theft is raised and Mac is unable to complete Mercedes' demands, causing him to feel trapped. He tearfully confesses everything to Noel, who promises to support him and scares Mercedes away from Mac, reminding her that she risks the custody of her child (Toby Murray). Mac is recommended to a support group, but he is too ashamed to attend and quickly re-offends, stealing a patient's tramadol tablets. Charlie Fairhead (Derek Thompson) discovers this and when Mac breaks down and explains everything to Charlie, he offers to hide the drugs. Charlie hides the drugs in his locker, but an investigation into the missing drugs begins. Elle Gardner (Jaye Griffiths) discovers the drugs and reports her findings to clinical nurse manager, Rita Freeman (Chloe Howman), under the impression they belonged to Charlie. Charlie keeps his promise and is suspended, leaving Mac feeling guilty and Elle ostracised from the staff. Noel informs Mac that he knows they were Mac's drugs and orders him to tell the truth, but he avoids doing so. Mac has a terrible day which sees him treat a girl who he discovers is being abused by her stepfather. The stepfather plays the victim by claiming that the girl is harassing him. When the truth is revealed about the abuse, the stepfather drags the girl out the ED, but Mac steps in and bravely takes a beating in order to protect her.

The character and Sallés' casting details were first announced on 31 May 2019. Rosa is billed as an \\"outspoken and confident\\" hospital porter from a Venezuelan background. Sallés described Rosa as \\"solitary\\", \\"fabulous [and] strong\\", and \\"a passionate, spirited lady, who's full of energy\\". and explained that Rosa is not afraid to speak her mind and gets involved in situations that do not concern her. She is not afraid of the emergency department hierarchy and immediately introduces herself to clinical lead Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing). Sallés explained that Rosa believes that \\"if there's a job to be done, let's not sit on formalities.\\" The actress confirmed that the character's backstory, including the reason she moved to the UK, would be explored during the series. Sallés was contracted with the drama until October 2019 and enjoyed working on the show, hoping that her contract would be extended. Series producer Lucy Raffety told Elaine Reilly of What's on TV that Rosa would feature in an \\"interesting story\\" with established character David Hide (Jason Durr). It was later confirmed that Rosa is a love interest for David. When Rosa arrives, she irritates her colleagues and patients by giving her opinion when it is not wanted. David becomes easily frustrated by Rosa's behaviour and tries to reprimand her. Sallés explained that David is easily wound up, but Rosa understands when to stop. When she hears David speaking in his \\"bumbling\\" manner, Rosa is attracted to him. The actress liked Durr's comic timing in the scenes and found him amusing. Sallés and Durr would often include extra unscripted movements and other things to the scene for comedic purposes or to explore their characters further. The actress appreciated how producers would allow them to do this. Sallés explained that Rosa and David would eventually become close as he is drawn to her honesty, practicality, as well as how she \\"cuts to the chase [and] grounds him\\". On Rosa's introduction, Reilly (What's on TV) believed that the character defied the traditional Casualty introduction of \\"their first day on the wards is a baptism of fire\\". Sue Haasler, writing for the Metro, liked Rosa and predicted that she would be \\"a wonderful character\\" that she would enjoy learning more about. Describing the character, she commented, \\"Rosa is feisty, strong and opinionated, but she has a really warm heart and sees through the masks that people put on.\\" Faith Cadogan Faith Cadogan, portrayed by Kirsty Mitchell, made her first appearance in the thirty-fourth series, in an episode originally broadcast on 28 December 2019. The character was first previewed in a show trailer, released on 5 December 2019, and Mitchell confirmed her casting on Twitter, where she expressed her excitement at joining the cast. Faith is described as an \\"efficient\\" advanced clinical practitioner (ACP) who impresses clinical lead Dylan Keogh (William Beck). The character is later revealed to be the wife of established character Lev Malinovsky (Uriel Emil). Reviewing Faith's first episode, Sue Haasler of the Metro described the character as \\"brilliant – skilled, calm and knowledgeable and exactly what was needed on such a terrible day.\\" Haasler later branded Faith \\"super-competent\\" and was surprised by the Faith and Lev pairing. Alice Chantrey Alice Chantrey, played by Sam Grey, made her first appearance on 1 April 2006. Alice joined the series as a receptionist and she later trained as a healthcare assistant. Grey chose to leave the series in 2010 and departed on 1 May 2010. It was announced on 16 August 2016 that Alice would guest appear in the show on 27 August 2016 for the show's thirtieth anniversary celebrations. It was announced on 3 February 2006 that Grey had been cast in the role. She said of her casting: \\"I'm really excited to be working with such skilled and talented actors on Casualty. It's a great opportunity to learn more. At the moment my real nerves are helping me to play the part of Alice as she's an anxious character.\\" Alice is described by the BBC as \\"cripplingly shy\\" and easily intimidated. Alice is befriended by Sam Bateman, and develops a crush on senior house officer Guppy Sandhu. Alice goes as far as to pretend one of the porters is her boyfriend in an effort to draw his attention, however all this achieves is helping Sam realise he has feelings for her himself. When the department is threatened with closure, consultant Harry Harper opposes the move, and Clinical Manager Nathan Spencer persuades Alice to claim that he has sexually harassed her, in order to sabotage Harry's campaign. Realising she has been tricked, Alice drops her claim and expresses a wish to leave for the South American rain forest, but Sam persuades her to stay. Later in the series, Sam himself leaves to travel in Thailand. Alice kisses him before his departure, confessing her love for him. Alice began a relationship with paramedic Curtis Cooper, which Grey described as \\"a bit of a slow burn\\", commenting: \\"They've been tiptoeing around each other for a while because they both have their own issues - Alice is a nervous character and very shy, while Curtis has a past, which he tries to keep back. Although they find it difficult to communicate they get on well and hit it off in the quirkiest way possible.\\" She assessed that Alice was initially nervous of the relationship as: \\"She's very naive, quite like a little girl in many ways. She's never had a proper relationship and is still a virgin. Curtis knows all this about her and is very careful with her as a result.\\" When Curtis is targeted by a local gang leader, Tony, he breaks up with Alice to protect her, as Tony threatens to kill her. When they later reunite, Alice is assaulted by Tony's girlfriend and admitted to the ED as a patient. She and Curtis become engaged, however on their wedding day, Alice is taken hostage at gunpoint on the hospital roof. Curtis tackles her assailant over the edge, and dies saving Alice. The Daily Mirror's Jim Shelley criticized Alice's relationship with Curtis, deeming it \\"about as convincing as Stacey Slater's with Bradley, or Corrie's Maria and Tyrone\\", lacking in plausibility as: \\"Alice had gone from being so virginal and meek she was practically mute to marrying a youth the police claimed used to be 'a serious player'.\\" Alice began to take a 'back-seat' role following the conclusion to her relationship with Curtis, appearing in few scenes per episode with minimal lines. Following the death of Adam Trueman's (Tristan Gemmill) son, he went on a downward spiral and had a one-night stand with Alice. He rejected her the following morning, devastating her. Alice remained concerned about Adam and having been hurt by Adam too many times, she gets a new job and decides to leave Holby City Hospital. Adam's ex-wife Jessica Harrison (Gillian Kearney) meets Alice before her departure, where Adam discovers them. Lily Chao Lily Chao, played by Crystal Yu, is a registrar who first appeared on 3 August 2013. Lily had been through several years training from her arrival until August 2015. The BBC have described Lily as an intelligent, logical, high- achiever who comes from a hard-working family that like to boast about their doctor daughter, but have never really told her they are proud of her. In 2014, series producer Erika Hossington spoke to Digital Spy about a series of standalone episodes the show would produce, revealing that the first standalone would feature Lily, \\"The first one is a murder mystery and the character it features is Lily. That's been written by Jeff Povey. It's a great episode and it's all set at night. The hospital is empty, so it feels like a very ghostly place and that really feeds into the story that we're telling. It's brilliant and it feels very different.\\" Lofty Chiltern Ben \\"Lofty\\" Chiltern, played by Lee Mead, made his first appearance in the series twenty-eight episode \\"The Last Chance Saloon\\", broadcast on 1 March 2014. The character was introduced to fill the \\"youngish male nurse\\" gap left by Jamie Collier following actor Daniel Anthony's decision to leave. Mead had previously appeared on the show in its twenty-sixth series as a patient and found it an honour to be invited back. Lofty was originally a staff nurse but was promoted to senior staff nurse in 2016. The character was specifically written for Mead, which helped the writing team when writing for the character. Mead opted to take a sabbatical from the show in 2015. On-screen, while the character was left running the ED, agency nurse Diane Stuart (Catherine Skinner) died and consequently, Lofty left Holby. The character departed in the series thirty episode \\"High Tide\\", broadcast on 12 March 2016. It was announced in February 2017 that the character would be reintroduced to Casualty sister show, Holby City, working as a staff nurse on the fictional Keller ward. Kirsty Clements Kirsty Clements, portrayed by Lucy Gaskell, is a staff nurse who first appeared in the twenty-fourth series episode \\"Russian Endings\\", broadcast on 15 May 2010.

Her personalities helps her build friendships with her colleagues, notably Adam Trueman (Tristan Gemmill) who she shares a close bond with. Producers used the character to highlight the issue of domestic violence and introduced Kirsty's husband, Warren Clements (Stephen Lord), and daughter, Nita Clements (Holly Earl), for the storyline. Gaskell quit the role after a year of filming, with Kirsty's departure concluding her domestic abuse storyline. Producers decided to create a positive exit for the character and on-screen, Kirsty decides to leave Holby with Nita after she is motivated to create happier memories for herself. The character made her final appearance in the series 25 episode \\"When You're Smiling\\", broadcast on 30 July 2011. Maggie Coldwell Actress Susan Cookson (pictured) as doctor Maggie Coldwell. Maggie started off her career in medicine as a nurse, before retraining to become a doctor. She is highly competent, although has been held back from progressing further up the career ladder as a result of a tendency to be too outspoken with hospital management, most notably clashing frequently with Nathan Spencer. She successfully applied for the role of consultant, before Nathan claimed there was no funding to pay her post. It was revealed that when her husband, Steve, had been sentenced to jail, she had told her children that he had died. When they discovered the truth and he was subsequently released, she allowed them to travel abroad with him to Malaysia. Paramedic Josh Griffiths was her lodger before his departure, however she has a long running romantic interest in Josh's best friend Charlie Fairhead. Maggie's daughter Joanne returned in January 2008, and Maggie was shocked to see that she was heavily pregnant. Maggie became a grandparent in February 2008, when Joanne gave birth to a baby girl called Lana. She now shares her house with Joanne, Lana, Toby and Ruth. At the end of the 2008 series Maggie decided to leave Holby after the shock and stress of the coroners court, where she was framed by Marilyn.

Jamie Collier Jamie Collier, played by Daniel Anthony, made his debut appearance in the seventeenth episode of the twenty- seventh series, broadcast on 5 January 2013. Jamie was introduced as the nephew of Jeff Collier (Matt Bardock) and was created as one of four student nurses introduced to the show. A social media account was created for each character by the show and the four characters also featured in an online 'webisode' where they interviewed \\"each other about their final training placement and their fears of working in a busy Emergency Department\\" on their mobile phones. Anthony, Henderson, Devereux and Newman visited a real emergency department to prepare for the role where they were offered to observe \\"the majors or minors department\\".

Davood Ghadami, who guest starred as \\"gay Iranian asylum seeker\\" Ramin in 2013, was asked to reprise his role for Jamie's exit storyline. Kent commented that there was \\"a rather nice chemistry\\" between Jamie and Ramin and so the series chose to reintroduce the character for a \\"rather nice story.\\" Anthony reprised his role in October 2014 for Bardock's exit from the series and returned in episode six of the twenty-ninth series, which broadcast on 11 October 2014. Jeff Collier Jeff Collier played by Matt Bardock, is a paramedic who first appeared on 10 February 2007. It was announced on 30 June 2014, that Jeff would be leaving later in the year after seven years on the show. Jeff left after being killed in an accident, where he saves the life of Martin Ashford (Patrick Robinson), on 4 October 2014. This led to the exit of Tamzin Bayle (Gemma Atkinson), the permanent return of Iain Dean (Michael Stevenson) and the guest appearance of Jamie Collier (Daniel Anthony). Jeff becomes good friends with Dixie upon his arrival, and when she is told budgetary constraints mean one of her team must be transferred, Jeff volunteers to go. He returns several months later, following the departure of Cyd Pyke. He discovers that fellow paramedic Snezana Lalovic (Ivana Bašić) is stealing hospital equipment to help illegal Serbian immigrants, and reluctantly agrees to keep it a secret when she swears not to do it again. In November 2009, Jeff was struck on the back of the head by Alistair MacCormack (Joe McFadden), who believed that Polly Emmerson (Sophia Di Martino), who he delusionally regarded as his \\"girlfriend\\", was seeing Jeff. Alistair also thought that Jeff had got a restraining order against him, but it was really Polly, who had reported Alistair to the police. Jeff was admitted to the ED. During a call to a college shooting, Jeff witnesses the death of a student that leaves him suffering post-traumatic stress and threatened his job. He was told that would either need to return at work during the week or have to leave his job. He got some help and returned to work. Jeff's wife, Lucy, leaves him after finding love with another man. He sees his children very infrequently. In between part 1 and part 2 of the Holby Riots, Dixie & Jeff were in a red button special, \\"The Kids Aren't Alright\\", which sees Dixie encourage Jeff to speak to his children again. In need of a lodger, Jeff searches for someone to move in and when Dixie's house is burnt down, she moves in with Jeff. Dixie asks Jeff to marry her, to make her father proud. Her father is unaware that she is a lesbian but catches her kissing another woman and suffers a heart attack. In series 27, his nephew, Jamie Collier (Daniel Anthony), joins the E.D as a student nurse and Jeff's father, Billy, dies shortly after Jamie's arrival. Jeff is a support to Dixie when her partner, Carol, dies of a brain injury. He becomes concerned for Jamie when he decides to leave Holby for Australia with new lover, Ramin but eventually decides to let him go. In series 28, Jeff is left stunned when past and former paramedic Tamzin Bayle (Gemma Atkinson) returns. Jeff later volunteers at an activity obstacle course. He meets event organiser, Samantha Keelman (Michelle Collins), helping her when she is admitted after slipping from a rope on a different obstacles. They agree to go out on a date, Samantha is revealed to be married and stabs her husband accidentally when he finds her and Jeff in bed. She attempts to blame Jeff but her lies are discovered and she is arrested by the police. Tamzin later reveals that she had called off her wedding. When his colleagues, Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing), Tess Bateman (Suzanne Packer), Martin Ashford (Patrick Robinson), Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford) and Lily Chao (Crystal Yu) are involved in a car crash, Jeff and Dixie arrive to help, successfully saving their colleagues. Meanwhile, Jeff tells his wife Dixie that he wants a divorce. In order to save Ash from bleeding out, he forcibly pulls out a piece of metal from his leg, allowing Dixie and the firemen to pull him out and carry him to the ambulance. Before Jeff can exit the vehicle, it explodes, killing him instantly as a horrified Ash and Dixie watch on. Inside Soap described Jeff and Dixie as the 'dynamic duo'. In an interview with Inside Soap, producer Nikki Harris teased what was next for the two saying, \\"Dixie and Jeff were central to our opening episodes in Cardiff, as they really came under pressure with the car crash and the explosion that happened on the estate. And as we look at how the police interact with ED later on, the paramedics are going to be on the front line in terms of that, because they're sort of in between each side. So Jeff and Dixie are set to have key roles in those storylines when they play out on screen.\\" On 28 March 2014, it was announced Michelle Collins would join the cast as Samantha Keeler, the love interest of Jeff. It was revealed that as the romance with Jeff blossoms, a secret held by Samantha threatens to turn both of their worlds upside down. Casualty's executive producer Oliver Kent said: \\"We can't wait for everyone to meet Samantha and see where her story goes over the two months she's on screen. Michelle has been absolutely brilliant and her arrival is set to have a huge impact on one of the show's most loved characters.\\" On 30 June 2014, it was announced that Bardock would be leaving his role as Jeff after seven years in the role and that Jeff would depart on-screen in late 2014, after the conclusion of his new love interest storyline with Samantha Keeler. Executive producer, Oliver Kent spoke about Bardock's departure; \\"Matt Bardock has given us one of Casualty's all-time favourite characters and we are sad to see him go. Jeff Collier has been an iconic action hero for seven years and we have been so lucky to have had him on our team for so long. We wish him all the very best for the future.\\" Bardock spoke about his exit from the programme on Twitter after receiving several messages from fans. He tweeted that he was overwhelmed with all the lovely comments and then thanked his fans for the 'love and support' for Jeff. He said it was a real 'gas' for seven years.

He was teased to have a \\"secret past\\" that \\"comes back to haunt him\\". Curtis formed a relationship with Alice Chantrey (Sam Grey), which hit turmoil when Curtis' past was explored. Grey described Curtis as \\"a reformed bad boy\\" with \\"a past\\". Curtis departed at the end of the twenty-third series, broadcast on 1 August 2009. Curtis was killed off and died as a result of his injuries after falling from the hospital roof. The Daily Mirror's Jim Shelley criticized Alice's relationship with Curtis, deeming it \\"about as convincing as Stacey Slater's with Bradley, or Corrie's Maria and Tyrone\\", lacking in plausibility as: \\"Alice had gone from being so virginal and meek she was practically mute to marrying a youth the police claimed used to be 'a serious player'.\\" =D= Gemma Dean Gemma \\"Gem\\" Dean, played by Rebecca Ryan, made her first appearance in \\"Little Sister\\", an episode in series 31. The sister of Iain Dean (Michael Stevenson), she is introduced when she recognises Iain while he is working as a paramedic. She goes to prison following a car accident, but is later released. Iain gets her a job as a barista in the hospital. At first, she refuses to fill in the application form for the job, and short-changes customers; it is then revealed that she cannot read or write. Gemma later secures a job as a porter. She is in a relationship with F1 junior doctor Rash Masum (Neet Mohan). Toby De Silva Toby De Silva, portrayed by Matthew Needham, made his first appearance on 8 September 2007. Toby is a doctor who has just graduated from medical school. As an only child whose parents are in the medical profession, Toby was pushed into medicine. On his first day on the show, we saw his lack of confidence which earned him the nickname Dracula. After making lots of mistakes and messing up an injection on a patient in front of his mother, Professor Camille Windsor, he decided to resign. Adam Trueman decided to give Toby another chance to prove himself by giving him a tricky procedure to do. After completing the procedure successfully, he decided to stay. Since then Toby became more and more confident at his job and at Christmas 2007, he kissed Maggie under the mistletoe for a pound. She offered him her spare room, which he accepted, becoming her lodger. On 2 February 2008, Toby and Abs Denham found Ruth had hanged herself in her room. Toby found it hard to cope being the only F2 around and only just managed to complete a complicated procedure to save a girl's life. After Ruth's attempted suicide, Toby got drunk at a pub with Maggie's pregnant daughter, Joanne. When she went into labour, he was forced to deliver the baby himself. The birth was successful and Toby and Joanne have since become lovers. Toby took a job in Orthopaedics with Sean Anderson as his boss. He was furious to discover Maggie had expressed serious doubts about his ability to do the job. In November 2008, Toby discovered Ruth had spent the night with new Clinical Lead Nick Jordan and told her that Jordan was using her for a night of sex, not the whirlwind romance she believed was happening. She refused to believe him, saying that he was only saying that as he'd always fancied her. Later on, Toby went for a drink with new medical counsellor, Ben Harding, to discuss his feelings about Ruth but she found him in bed with Ben later that night which was the start of many problems to come. Toby withdrew his statement and after arguing with Ben, embarrassed himself at the Christmas party with drink in hand. He threw away his NHS id badge but then realised he needed it to get his belongings back. He saw it and jumped into a boat, trying to retrieve it, but his foot went through the wood. He nearly drowned but luckily Toby was rescued and taken to casualty. He told his father that he was gay and told Mr Jordan that he wanted to quit immediately rather than serve his notice. This plan was derailed, following a rush of patients following a train crash, Mr Jordan said he could quit at the end of the shift. Only Toby was able to deal with a young girl who was refusing treatment. Saying goodbye to Ruth, he tricked her telling there was a spider on her head which made her close her eyes. He took the opportunity to kiss her on the cheek before leaving. As he walked through the ED he received hugs and smiles from his co-workers. Outside, due to Toby's father, Ben met him and they walked out of the ED carpark with promises of coffee. Toby made a brief reappearance at the end of episode 3 of series 24 when he is seen to openly kiss the medical counsellor, Ben Harding and then they both head into the pub to join the rest of the team from the just- finished shift. He is welcomed with open arms by his ex-colleagues and offers some friendly advice to the new F2 doctors. Iain Dean Iain Dean, played by Michael Stevenson, first appeared in the red-button special Under Fire, credited as Corporal Dean. Iain was introduced as a former army colleague of Sam Nicholls who he had an affair with in Afghanistan. Iain made a Casualty debut on 28 April 2012 for one episode. Stevenson returned to Casualty in April 2013 on a six-month contract, with Iain returning on-screen on 31 August. Iain's return saw him join the paramedic team as a student paramedic. Stevenson's contract ended in autumn 2013 and Iain's exit scenes aired on 22 March 2014. It was announced on 19 May 2014 that Stevenson had returned to Casualty as a regular character and that Iain's return scenes would air in the sixth episode of series 29. These scenes aired on 11 October. Stevenson appears as Iain in a crossover two-part episode with Casualty spin- off series, Holby City, originally broadcast in March 2019. In March 2014, Stevenson spoke of how \\"lucky\\" he felt to have been able to have multiple stories, having only been introduced as part of one storyline, \\"I’ve been dead lucky. I went in to serve one storyline and ended up with stories of my own! I’ve been so lucky to come straight into the love story with Sam and then for this other storyline to develop.\\" He also went on to speak of how he was aware of Iain's history upon his casting as well as how his character was not intended to be as central as he was. In August 2014, series producer Erika Hossington discussed Iain's return with Digital Spy, \\"We will see the return of Michael Stevenson as paramedic Iain, and he's coming back into the show as a regular character. It's going to be fun establishing his partnership with Dixie, and especially seeing how Dixie copes with the change after she and Jeff were such a strong team.\\" Iain first appears in the red-button special \\"Under Fire\\" as the army colleague of Sam Nicholls. The special explores their relationship and the work they do in Afghanistan. When Iain appears in Casualty, he is seen to give evidence at the hearing of Sam, after she restrained a patient from attacking Dylan Keogh. Iain is not seen again following his brief appearance at court until August 2013. Iain returns as the new student paramedic, working alongside Dixie Dixon and Jeff Collier. It becomes clear to the pair that Iain is overly confident and will need to be kept in line. He continues to try and prove himself to Jeff and Dixie, but receives backlash when he fortunately manages to rescue a woman from a bus crash seconds before it exploded. Iain returned on 6 October 2014, following news that Jeff had died in an explosion. He immediately returned for his funeral and helped Dixie grieve. A struggling Dixie decided to work instead of go to Jeff's funeral and in a bid to change her mind, Iain decides to go with her. They successfully help a homeless man who has been dumped in landfill. Iain talks to Dixie and they rush to the funeral, where they are in time for Dixie's reading. Iain arrives at the wake to celebrate Jeff's life. He follows Dixie and Tamzin Bayle to the ambulance shelter where Tamzin reveals she is leaving Holby following the wake. Following this, Dixie offers Iain his old job as a paramedic. He accepts with delight. In October 2015 Iain begins a relationship with Rita Freeman after a one-night stand. However, this ended in 2016 after she pretended her ex-husband was stalking her and had punched her in the face, when in fact it was herself who did it. Abs Denham John \\"Abs\\" Denham, portrayed by James Redmond, made his first appearance on 4 October 2003. Redmond chose to leave the role in 2008, with Abs departing the show on 18 October 2008, after five years on-screen. It was announced on 16 August 2016 that Abs would guest appear in the show on 27 August 2016 for the show's thirtieth anniversary celebrations. Abs' first day at work was particularly memorable. He discovered that an escaped psychiatric patient had stolen his identity and was posing as him within the Emergency Department. Although the impostor successfully fooled Clinical Nurse Manager Tess Bateman (Suzanne Packer), the matter was eventually sorted out and the genuine Abs was able to start doing his job. Abs entered into a short lived marriage with Ellen Zitek (Georgina Bouzova), the half-sister of his love interest Nina Farr (Rebekah Gibbs). Ellen lied to him over the course of many months about the danger she faced in her home country, and Abs agreed to get married simply to help her get a visa. It eventually became clear however, that Ellen's motives had not been genuine, and she was acting simply out of malice toward Nina. She left for a short period, during which Abs reunited with Nina - however, they were soon harassed by a loan shark to whom Ellen owed £15,000. Abs struggled to keep up with the payments, and not only got beaten up but had items repossessed. However, after being beaten up himself, the loan shark was fatally injured and Abs was free of Ellen's debt. Immigration officials also informed him that they would not be investigating his marriage to Ellen any longer, leaving him free to enjoy his time with Nina. Once Ellen returned, Abs demanded a divorce. However, she soon revealed she was suffering from cancer, and although both Abs and Nina supported her throughout, several months later she was killed in an unrelated incident, run down by a motorbike, leaving Abs a widower. His relationship with Nina disintegrated during this period, with him first reacting poorly to the revelation she had once had relationships with women and identified as bisexual. He then became jealous of her relationship with Greg Fallon (Kip Gamblin), and eventually Nina decided to leave Holby. In a special Comic Relief episode written by Richard Curtis, Abs was participating in a sleep-a-thon and was taken hostage by Megan Roach's (Brenda Fricker) grandson who crashed his camper van. Abs was unhurt but for a minor cut on his head. He was shot on New Year's Eve 2007 while out at a night club with Kelsey Phillips (Janine Mellor) but he escaped with just a minor injury to his arm. In protest of Charlie Fairhead's (Derek Thompson) redundancy, he called an unofficial work-to-rule, but after a patient died as a result, he realised he'd taken things too far and called it off. In March 2008, Abs attended his brother's funeral. At the funeral, he was reunited with his old friend Stacey. However, when his friend's drunken behaviour ended in a violent punch-up, Abs was forced to talk to Stacey about the dangers of alcoholism. Later, he revealed to his mother that he wanted to open up a clinic to treat alcoholism. Jack Diamond Jack Diamond, played by Alistair Brammer, made his first appearance during the thirtieth series. Jack was a receptionist, who formed a friendship with receptionist Noel Garcia (Tony Marshall). The character was first previewed in the 2015 autumn trailer, which was released on 18 September 2015, where a receptionist character called Jack was revealed. Brammer's casting was announced by executive producer Oliver Kent in an interview with Radio Times, where he billed Jack as \\"flamboyant and outrageous and waspish\\". Brammer confirmed on Twitter that he was only contracted on the show for six months and he left after appearing in fifteen episodes.

On 5 May 2015, Dixie made a guest appearance in Holby City on the AAU ward, where she reunites with Adrian \\"Fletch\\" Fletcher (Alex Walkinshaw) and helps him with his ongoing issues. It was announced in January 2016 that Hazlegrove had left her role of Dixie after almost 10 years with her final scenes airing on 30 January 2016. She first appeared as a paramedic having transferred from another hospital alongside close friend, Cyd Pyke. When senior paramedic Josh Griffiths takes a six-month sabbatical to travel the world, Dixie becomes Operational Duty Officer. She forges a friendship with new recruit, Jeff Collier, to whom she admits she is a lesbian. Believing Cyd's life is in danger, following a venomous snake bite, Dixie confesses her love for her friend. When Cyd recovers, their friendship is strained by this and she transfers to another hospital. In series 23, Dixie accidentally runs a girl over whilst driving the ambulance.

Inside Soap described Dixie and Jeff as the 'dynamic duo'. In an interview with Inside Soap, producer Nikki Harris teased what was next for the two saying, \\"Dixie and Jeff were central to our opening episodes in Cardiff, as they really came under pressure with the car crash and the explosion that happened on the estate. And as we look at how the police interact with ED later on, the paramedics are going to be on the front line in terms of that, because they're sort of in between each side. So Jeff and Dixie are set to have key roles in those storylines when they play out on screen.\\" In 2014, series producer Erika Hossington spoke to Digital Spy about the future plans for Dixie, saying that she and Jeff would be at the focus before his departure, \\"The other main characters we'll be focusing on over the next few months are Jeff and Dixie. I know the fans are really keen to know whether Dixie returns from her suspension before Jeff leaves, and I can confirm that she does - it would have been a huge letdown to the audience if she hadn't!\\" Hossington continued to say that following Jeff's departure that Dixie would establish a partnership with Iain, \\"It's going to be fun establishing Iain's partnership with Dixie, and especially seeing how Dixie copes with the change after she and Jeff were such a strong team.\\" Lisa \\"Duffy\\" Duffin  Lisa \\"Duffy\\" Duffin, played by Cathy Shipton, is one of the show's original characters and is a senior ward sister and senior midwife.

With Holby under intense media scrutiny, Elle finds some missing drugs in Charlie's locker and immediately reports them to Rita. Rita is obliged to inform Connie and Charlie is placed on immediate administrative leave, but since he is especially well-loved and trusted in the department Elle's decision draws the ire and mistrust of the whole staff, including even Jacob.

Back at Adam's house, Jessica seems happy to stay until she finds Harry's feeding spoon in a kitchen drawer. Unable to take any more, Adam insists Jessica make a decision about staying or leaving there and then. In 2016, Kearney described filming the scenes in which Adam and Jessica's car submerged into a frozen lake as \\"the biggest thing\\" she has been involved in. She recalled that she had a \\"fear of water beforehand\\", before stating how \\"exciting\\" filming the scenes was because \\"it's so big budget and it's weird to see\\". David Hide David Hide, played by Jason Durr, made his first screen appearance on 30 April 2016 as a staff nurse. The character and Durr's casting was announced on 24 February 2016, alongside those of Jez Andrews (Lloyd Everitt) and Elle Gardner (Jaye Griffiths). Executive producer Oliver Kent described the three castings as \\"wonderful\\" and said their storylines would be \\"brilliantly vibrant, bold and gripping\\". David is characterised as a \\"shy, withdrawn, and socially awkward\\" nurse. He was billed as someone who \\"goes about their work efficiently and quietly\\", with another side to his personality that would \\"love to be able to unleashed\\", but comes \\"at a price\\". Durr said he felt \\"delighted and thrilled\\" to be joining the \\"iconic\\" show in its thirtieth year, and described David as \\"intriguing\\". Durr confessed that despite being in a medical drama, he had \\"a huge phobia of needles and blood\\" and was hoping his new role would overcome his \\"life long fear\\".

Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap described David as \\"an oddball\\" with \\"a troubled past\\". David's family was introduced in September 2016, with Harry Collett and Lorraine Pilkington cast as David's son, Ollie, and former wife, Rosa, respectively.

He explained that there has been distractions in David's life which have prevented him from seeing \\"as much as Ollie as he wants to.\\" David's absence from Ollie's life have created issues, which Durr said needed to \\"be dealt with\\". Rosa disapproved of David and Ollie's relationship due to her dislike of David's past behaviour, which she revealed in the middle of the ED. Durr believed that David did not \\"feel great\\" about Rosa's outburst, but said that David \\"strives to deal with it\\" and \\"tries to be positive\\". Durr, Collett and Pilkington filmed a stunt which saw Ollie left trapped in a car engulfed in flames and Hide described the scenes as \\"a joy to do\\" because it forces David \\"to step up, which is difficult for him\\". During his first shift, David managed to impress consultants Connie Beauchamp and Dylan Keogh (Amanda Mealing and William Beck), despite having previously concerned Dylan by his lack of speech. David dislikes people calling him 'Dave' and is frustrated when consultant Elle Gardner repeatedly does this, but charge nurse Charlie Fairhead (Derek Thompson) reassures him that she is only messing with him.

After suppressing his emotions for so long with his bipolar medication, David comes off them, so that he can live his life. He quickly becomes manic, hallucinating a psychiatrist and impulsively buying a sports car, before taking Robyn for a drive in it. She goes into labour and David proceeds to try to deliver her baby in a graveyard, at night, while it is raining. The birth does not go to plan and as a result, Robyn's baby suffers serious medical complications in her early life. David is taken to a psychiatric ward, and once released rejoins the ED staff.

People have always told Robyn that she's a 'born nurse'. As far as the \\"care\\" part of the job goes she's one of the best but she does worry about the academic side of the job – maths, chemistry and biology have never been her best subjects! Robyn is determinedly positive and extremely chatty. She makes friends easily and is able to charm patients and get them on side with her down to earth talkative charm. However, this can sometimes be her downfall as she loves a good gossip but isn't the best at keeping secrets! When Robyn met her fellow student nurses, she instantly struck a bond with Jamie Collier and was devastated when he left. Robyn's stepbrother, Max Walker, was later introduced and he moved in with Robyn when his music career flopped. She managed to get him a job in the ED as a porter, replacing Big Mac. Robyn was admitted in the ED as a patient when she went back home and found a man ironing a shirt he stole from Max's wardrobe. She began to chase him to the garden and over the fence where she jumped onto a rake, impaling her foot. The man, who told Robyn his name was Nigel, helped Robyn and called 999. He stayed with her as she was admitted in the ED but missed his interview at St James' Hospital. He had left his wallet behind when he left to try and save his potential job and Robyn saw that his name was actually Lofty Chiltern. He returned, after feeling too guilty, and when questioned remained adamant that his name was Nigel. Robyn told Rita Freeman (Chloe Howman) about him and her worries and she said that she would be happy to ring the police for her and advised that Robyn should let her do so.

There Robyn meets Glen, an apparently sweet, punny man who had recently lost his wife to cancer. After an awkward start, their relationship blossoms and Robyn is visibly elated. However, David notices something suspicious and discovers that there is no record of Glen's wife; it surmises he has fabricated the whole thing to win Robyn's pity. Robyn is incensed and declares her wish to never see him again. Some time later, Glen is admitted to the ED with several physical injuries. When some test results show unusual signs, he admits that he has a cancerous tumour on his brain, which explains why he was so desperate to make a connection with Robyn. In light of this, Robyn forgives him. Though Glen has been told the cancer is terminal, Robyn vows to stick by him and encourages him to consider his options; she begins to take notes on his symptoms and develop diet plans. They visit Paris together and have other plans in mind, but right when Robyn is about to ask for his hand in marriage, Glen discovers he has less time than he originally thought, and has a seizure that sends him back into the ED. Though she is deeply troubled by the news, she remains optimistic and encouraging. Glen starts to think that marrying her would be cruel, considering he would leave her a widow after mere months, and that he is undeserving of her, but after a conversation with Dylan of all people, he decides to marry her, asking Dylan to tell Robyn while he is being treated. However, Glen develops complications during a CT scan and gets stuck in a lift en route to neurology. Robyn accepts his proposal over the intercom, and they prepare to get married that very same day. In the midst of all of this, Robyn is visibly tired and suddenly faints. Dylan administers a blood test on her, suspecting anemia, but it turns out she is pregnant. This leaves Robyn happier about her situation, since it means she will always have part of Glen with her. Unaware of this, Glen asks for paper on which to write his wedding vows just before the ceremony. He instead writes a letter to Robyn containing the message that he must leave her. Robyn is walked down the aisle only for David to hand her the letter, leaving her completely heartbroken.

The character and Oshin's casting details were first announced on 14 August 2019. Mason is billed as an \\"over confident\\" F1 doctor who \\"sees himself as a high flier and someone who's going places\\". Mason struggles with his first shift and as a result, he has to prove himself to his colleagues in the emergency department (ED). Oshin expressed his delight at joining the cast and Simon Harper, the executive producer, revealed that the actor impressed the casting team in his first audition. He also praised him and his performance as Mason, commenting, \\"He's brilliant as Mason, layering the character with a deep vulnerability beneath the bravado of a junior Doctor.\\" Harper also confirmed that the character would be a focus in the series as the drama explores the NHS at \\"critical breaking point\\". After Mason reports Rash Masum (Neet Mohan) to the clinical lead, Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy confirmed that he would cause trouble for another of his colleagues. Sue Haasler, writing for the Metro, described the character as \\"tall, confident and cocky – but not in a good way\\", and thought he \\"has a massive amount to learn from the Casualty school of compassion\\". Dainty (Digital Spy) dubbed the character \\"abrupt [and] cocky\\" and observed that Mason had \\"absolutely no qualms in throwing his mentor Rash under the bus\\" in his first episode. On the character, she added, \\"But keep a close eye on this one, as all might not be as it seems.\\" Oshin's last episode was broadcast on 28 December 2019, when Mason was found dead in a store cupboard by Rash. Yuki Reid Yuki Reid, played by Will Sharpe, is an F2 Junior Doctor. He was one of eight new Foundation House Officer Year 2 doctors joining the department at the start of series 24. He had known May since the beginning of medical school and helped her out with work, secretly smitten with her. However, May leaves the series after she frames Yuki for breaking a patient's neck, causing her to become paralysed. This resulted in Yuki running away and ending up being admitted to hospital after sleeping rough. After the breakdown of Yuki and May's relationship, he became very close to fellow F2 Lenny. Yuki and the F2s spent the majority of the series competing for the JAFA award, but on the day of the award ceremony he finds out that Lenny has been guaranteed the award in return for keeping quiet about a botched medical trial. After the reveal, the JAFA is cancelled, but Mr Jordan brings both doctors back. In the same episode, 'What Tonight Means to Me - Part One', a series of flashbacks explained that Yuki's brother had cancer and died, explaining his real reason for becoming a doctor, rather than because of his relationship with May, as previously believed. In terms of personality, whilst he is a young, intelligent and handsome man, Yuki suffers from social anxiety, low confidence, low self-esteem, the tendency to obsess over detail and shyness. Still, he has shown that he can rise to the occasion when needed and his ability to diagnose patients is outstanding. Megan Roach Megan Roach, portrayed by actress Brenda Fricker, is one of the original characters of the series, making her first appearance in the first episode, \\"Gas\\", on 6 September 1986. Megan would remain as a major character until the conclusion of the fifth series in 1990 when the actress left the show.

Megan committed suicide with the aid of Charlie and Tess to end her suffering on 7 August 2010. Her return episode was voted as the third best Casualty episode ever by fans. =S= Ruby Spark Ruby Spark, portrayed by Maddy Hill, made her first appearance on 14 July 2018. On 17 January 2018, Jack Hardwick of the Daily Star reported that Hill had joined the cast of the drama. Ruby is billed as an \\"incredibly conscientious\\" and \\"naïve\\" newly-qualified paramedic, who despite knowing the rules of her job, has lots to learn about being a paramedic. Ruby clashes with paramedics Iain Dean (Michael Stevenson) and Sam Nicholls (Charlotte Salt), although producer Lucy Raffety stated that Ruby would learn from Iain and Sam. Raffety told Emma Bullimore of TV Times that Ruby's introduction builds to the show's thirty-third series, which she billed as the \\"Year of the Paramedic\\". She also said that seeing paramedic life from Ruby's perspective would be \\"heartwarming and heartbreaking\\". Hill began filming in February 2018. Hill expressed her delight at joining the cast and commented, \\"Ruby is like no one I've ever played before.\\" Raffety also expressed her joy at Hill's casting and praised the actress. She hoped that Ruby would become a \\"massive hit\\" with the audience. Hill appears as Ruby in a crossover two-part episode with Casualty spin-off series, Holby City, originally broadcast in March 2019. Nathan Spencer Nathan Spencer, portrayed by actor Ben Price, was installed as the new corporate director of Holby city hospital NHS trust in 2005, and from the outset his unswaying mindset and failure to empathise with the human condition made him unpopular with his staff. His professional background was in banking, so his only concern was with meeting hospital targets and balancing the books. As a result, he would frequently clash with A&E; consultant Harry Harper, even threatening to remove Harry from his post because he consistently refused to make any sort of (financial) compromise with patient care. Nathan began his time at Casualty by stalking Selena Donovan. He was at one point jabbed with a needle which could possibly have been used by an HIV-positive patient. Nathan ordered a search of all clinical waste to find the needle and became more uptight than usual, with receptionist Alice Chantrey bearing the brunt of his anger. However, after being persuaded to take an HIV-test, Nathan was relieved to be given the all- clear. After starting a relationship with Selena, Nathan proposed marriage to her. Displaying character traits of being a jobsworth and a stickler for the rules, Nathan took great pleasure in installing a large plasma TV screen in the middle of the department to enforce the \\"four-hour rule\\", a government directive in which 98% of all A&E; patients must be seen, treated, and admitted/discharged within four hours of arrival. However, in blatant disregard of his own rules, on one occasion Nathan had his own mother admitted ahead of all those currently queued in the system. Harry Harper continued to clash with Nathan, so in another attempt to get rid of him, Nathan fabricated a charge of sexual harassment against him and persuaded Alice to make a complaint. Harry was suspended, but Alice became suspicious and withdrew her allegation when it threatened to devastate Harry's election campaign. Nathan was forced to confess all to Selena, who ended their engagement. When Harry was unexpectedly elected as Holby's new MP (he stood for Parliament in a bid to save the Emergency Department from closure), Nathan installed wildcard Australian Theo \\"Stitch\\" Lambert as the new consultant. When he discovered Stitch in his office taking cocaine, he was convinced to keep quiet by the threat of the ridicule which would ensue if it was revealed Nathan had made such a poor staffing choice. Later on in the series, Selena discovered she was pregnant with his baby. She informed Nathan that she had had an abortion, however later revealed to Harry that she had not actually done so. Nathan remained unaware of this until the last episode in the series, when Selena was shot dead. The team performed a Cesarean section on Selena, delivering her and Nathan a baby daughter, Angel. Angel later died in Nathan's arms after being diagnosed with a severe E. Coli infection in the NICU and he switched off her ventilator. Nathan left the show in episode six of series 22. He was sacked for incompetence by Harry Harper, now having quit Westminster to return as the Emergency Department's consultant manager. Despite their previous working relationship Harry found the job difficult, knowing what Nathan had recently been through. Patrick Spiller Patrick Spiller, played by Ian Kelsey, made his first appearance in the series fourteen episode \\"Free Fall\\", broadcast on 11 December 1999. He was introduced as a specialist registrar in emergency medicine. The character was described as \\"Casualty bad boy\\" by Marion McMullen of the Coventry Telegraph, who deemed him \\"arrogant, brusque and bad-tempered\\". Kelsey described him as \\"very good\\" at his job, but that his bedside manner becomes worse as the series develops. Patrick's storylines have included attempts to advance his career and relationships with Holly Miles, Rachel James and Lara Stone. Of Patrick's relationship with Rachel, Kelsey said \\"Spiller and Rachel just fancy each other - it's all about sex.\\" Kelsey chose to leave the series in 2001 and the character was killed off. Patrick departed the series in the series sixteen episode \\"Past, Present, Future\\", broadcast on 16 March 2002. =T= Adam Trueman Adam Trueman, portrayed by actor Tristan Gemmill, is a consultant in the emergency department. In preparation for the role, Gemmill spent 8 hours shadowing a real consultant on an ED shift as research for the role. Describing his character, he assessed: \\"Adam is self-confident, witty and brash, an excellent doctor who cares deeply about his job. He presents a strong exterior to the world but perhaps has issues and vulnerabilities that suggest there is more to him than you might first expect.\\" Upon his arrival, Adam clashes with clinical lead Harry Harper (Simon MacCorkindale), however they come to appreciate one another more with time. On Harry's last day, he offers Adam his job but Adam refuses and Zoe Hanna (Sunetra Sarker) is given it instead. At a party, Adam meets Jessica Harrison (Gillian Kearney) and they have a one-night stand. He was shocked to find that she is the department's new nurse when he arrives at work the next morning. He and Jessica begin an affair, but she breaks up with him when her son Lucas is injured in a road accident while they are together. At the beginning of series 23, following Jessica's discovery that her husband was also having an affair, Gemmill explained: \\"Adam is hopeful they will get together again but Jessica has a more realistic approach because obviously she doesn't want to abandon her children. She's having troubles with Sean, and she sort of more or less decides that actually 'no this is not going anywhere' and she has got to get over it, forgive Sean and move on with her life, which leaves Adam quite smacked in the face really. He has a bit of an unstable time of it.\\" Gemmill added that: \\"Adam's state of mind is not helped by the arrival of Nick Jordan who comes into the department as Clinical Lead and has very definite ideas of how to run the place. Adam clashes with him almost straight away and they stay at loggerheads for some time.\\" Later in the series, Adam's brother, Alex, who was paralysed in an accident when they were children, begins to deteriorate from a resultant illness. Adam is devastated when his brother dies, and channels his anger towards Nick, who helped Alex sign an advance directive requesting not to be resuscitated. When Adam discovers Jessica's new son Harry could be his, the two renew their relationship. He is angry when she uses Harry as bait to get her other children, Lucas and Amelia, back from their father who has taken them to Saudi Arabia. They later reconcile, and Adam proposes. Although Jessica turns him down, they stay together, and a DNA test confirms Adam is Harry's father. Jessica then later accepts Adam's proposal, and a wedding is being arranged for the New Year. Adam, Jessica and the three children are now all living together, with Adam taking an active role as father. Their New Year's Eve wedding is aborted when they are called back to the ED to deal with a major accident, and have to settle for a blessing in the hospital chapel. However, returning to the wedding venue to sign the legal papers, their car skids onto an icy lake and plunges in, ultimately leaving Jessica in a coma and Harry dead. Jessica gradually recovers but she and Adam drift further apart, leading to her departure to America with an old school friend, Linda Andrews (Christine Tremarco) which leaves Adam devastated. He becomes increasingly reckless, having a one-night stand with young vulnerable HCA Alice Chantrey (Sam Grey) and inviting himself into a patient's house after work one night. Adam then begins a false relationship with the patient's mother, hoping to relive the paternal feelings he had for his own son, Harry, and Jessica's two other children. After this relationship disintegrates, Adam spirals further into depression. Louise Tyler Louise Tyler (originally Tilney) played by Azuka Oforka, is a staff nurse. She first appeared on 1 October 2011, appearing for four episodes as an ambulance dispatcher before returning as the new receptionist, drafted in to give Noel Garcia (Tony Marshall) more support following the Holby riots on 18 August 2012. Louise is extremely organised, very efficient and loves to be in control. According to the BBC Louise has no problem giving a dressing down to anyone she considers lazy, a time-waster, in the wrong, or simply in her way. In her first episode, Louise fell out with the paramedic duty manager, Dixie Dixon (Jane Hazlegrove) and when she returned as a receptionist, it was shown that they had still fallen out but episodes later, Louise had to get details of a patient who was in resus however, she was scared of going in because of the blood. Dixie noticed this and helped her overcome this fear. Louise and Dixie then became friends. Louise became 'frenemies' with Big Mac (Charles Dale) and Noel and was often to be found in argument with them. She also helped Noel when he was left homeless and was support for Big Mac when he was held hostage by Iain's unstable army colleague, Kenny. In July 2015, it is revealed that Louise has history with new senior staff nurse Jacob Masters (Charles Venn), but asks that he does not reveal their past. It is later discovered that Louise was previously a nurse, but left the role. In August, original character Lisa \\"Duffy\\" Duffin (Cathy Shipton) makes a two-episode appearance, having previously appeared in the show for twelve years. Duffy inspires Louise to become a nurse again, a post she returns to. When Duffy returned to the ED full-time in August, it was revealed that Louise had been mentored by Duffy. Oforka decided to leave her role as Louise in 2018 after appearing in the show for seven years. The character's exit was not announced beforehand and Louise leaves in episode 24 of the thirty-third series, originally broadcast on 16 February 2019, after a long-running storyline about an ongoing financial struggle.

Ruth Winters Ruth Winters (portrayed by actress Georgia Taylor from 2007) is one of three new characters to join Casualty at the beginning of its twenty-second series. It was first announced on 18 July 2007 that Taylor had been cast in the role of Ruth. The BBC describe the character as \\"clever, hardworking and focused\\", stating that she has wanted to be a doctor since she was eight, and graduated top of her class - working hard at the expense of her personal life. Taylor herself has commented: \\"Ruth's very responsible and articulate, and seems pretty confident. But underneath it all, she's something of a troubled soul which hopefully we'll find out later on. She's very self-critical and won't allow herself to make any mistakes. But, for a junior doctor, the whole first year in a hospital is about making mistakes and learning from it. Ruth won't accept help from anyone; she thinks she knows it all.\\" During her first few months, Ruth misdiagnoses a patient with severe stomach pains, missing a ruptured ectopic pregnancy but blames a nurse so she can preserve her reputation. Ruth is shocked when her alcoholic father is admitted as a patient and reluctantly fakes a blood alcohol test so he will not be prosecuted for causing an accident but is devastated to realise he has manipulated her into this. Ruth goes on to give a patient the wrong medication and orders a nurse to remove another patient's neck brace, leaving them paralysed as a result. She lies about her culpability and accidentally gives a patient a morphine overdose. When a suicidal patient dies in her care, Ruth confesses her mother committed suicide when she was a child. When Ruth misdiagnoses yet another patient, resulting in his death, she hangs herself. She is in a coma for a month, but eventually recovers.

She goes on to begin a tentative relationship with nurse, Jay Faldren. Series producer Oliver Kent commented on their pairing: \\"Ruth's never allowed romance into her life, but when she starts to get close to Jay, the possibility of happiness with another person suddenly presents itself to her. But the question is, will she allow herself? Or will his laddish ways get in the way? She's so obsessed with her career that she's always tempted to put that first.\\" In series 24, the first episodes show that Ruth and Jay are continuing their relationship - keeping it from their colleagues for her benefit but this annoys Jay, giving her the ammunition to kiss him in public but, when they head home, Ruth realises she has missed some pills and worries she could be pregnant. Discovering that she is pregnant, she takes a pill to terminate the pregnancy without telling Jay. On her birthday, Jay gives her a necklace for their date at the surgeon's dinner. Ruth's happiness is short-lived when senior medic Sarah Evans warns her that Jay is bad news and that she'll think twice about recommending her for the surgical training post if she continues to see him.

Later in the series, her brother Jonathan, visits and reveals that he has just been released from prison. Ruth is horrified to see Jonathan when he turns up, looking for her help, much to Jay's surprise, who didn't realise she had a brother. Jonathan swears that he has turned over a new leaf but she sees his track marks, refuses to believe he's changed. Later, a group of hard-drinking homeless men cause havoc when they steal bottles of alcohol-based hand sanitiser and take it to an hospital annexe to enjoy in private. Tragedy strikes when young security guard, Mick, desperate for Ruth's approval, confronts the homeless men but Jonathan is quick to get help. Ruth looks forward to celebrating Christmas with her brother when she notices an heirloom is missing from her flat and plunged into a world of stolen phones, heroin overdoses and male prostitution, Ruth realises that she's likely to face Christmas alone. Days after a lonely Christmas, Ruth and Jay are thrown together on a medical case and Ruth finally admits that she's lonely. Letting down her guard, she accepts Jay's comfort and the pair go home together. However, this is short lived, when Ruth admits that she terminated the pregnancy, leading to Jay dumping her. This leads to her to build the courage to admit she loves him but he walks away anyway. Months later, Ruth has a big presentation that goes horribly wrong. When conference organiser and big name doctor Edward takes an interest in her, she's incredibly flattered and a little bit smitten. Ruth married Edward Thurlow, Clinical Director of Neurosurgery on 26 June 2010, making Jay too late when he pleads his undying love at the register office, leaving Ruth to reveal that she has already married. Despite marrying Edward, it is hinted that Ruth still has feelings for Jay and that he feels the same. However, Ruth's feelings are spurned when she discovers Jay is dating Polly.

Actress Emily Carey took over the role in November 2014, when the character was introduced to Casualty. Grace is the daughter of Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing) and Sam Strachan (Tom Chambers) and the younger half-sister of Kieron Patel. Following a short cameo appearance in the first episode of series 32, Carey confirmed she would be departing the serial for \\"quite a while\\". Grace is born seven weeks premature and in the breech position. As she was starved of oxygen, she has to spend some time in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. After a scan shows that she has a bleed on the brain and internal bleeding, Grace is placed on a ventilator. Grace almost dies from an Intraventricular hemorrhage and has to have a blood transfusion. Connie decides to turn off Grace's life support when her ECG results show minimal brain-stem activity. When Doctor Ooma Chowdry (Sakuntala Ramanee) asks Connie if she wants to hold Grace, Connie declines, but Sam holds her and notices she is breathing on her own. Grace pulls through and Connie allows Sam increased access to his daughter. Sam ask Maddy to look after Grace and while Grace is in a room on her own, Susie Prendergast kidnaps Grace, thinking she is her baby sister. She threatens to drop Grace on her head, but Sam and Maddy persuade Susie to give her back. When Grace is 10 months old, she falls down the stairs and is badly injured. She is rushed to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit and undergoes surgery for a collapsed lung and nearly dies. Grace leaves with Connie, who has decided to care for her father, who has been diagnosed with cancer. A few years later, Grace is expelled from boarding school and returns to Holby. Her relationship with her mother suffers as Connie spends a lot of time at work. Grace's grandmother, Audrey Strachan, tells her that she is going to live in New York with Sam. Connie is against the idea, but later allows Grace to live with her father. She returns to Connie in February 2016 after nearly a year in America. Connie places much more priority on her daughter following her return. However, Grace soon discovers her mother is in a relationship with Jacob Masters. Impatient from past experiences, Grace delivers an ultimatum and threatens to go back to America, so Connie stops seeing Jacob. Meanwhile, Grace returns to school in England and makes friends with a girl called Carmel. Connie helps Grace win over Carmel and her highly competitive mother by purposely losing at her school's sports day. As Grace's new friendship continues, her hold on her mother loosens and Connie begins seeing Jacob again in private. During a sleepover, Carmel injures her leg on a trampoline and Grace runs to her own house to get Connie. There she discovers Connie and Jacob alone together, which angers her. At the hospital it is discovered that Carmel is malnourished and has scratches and bruising on her abdomen. Grace allows Carmel to blame her for the injuries. Jacob is convinced that Grace is lying, especially considering that she bites her nails and so can't scratch people. He coaxes the truth out of her; Carmel's mother has been psychologically abusing her daughter, and the injuries were self-inflicted. Connie confronts Carmel's mother and social services are contacted. Following this shared experience, Grace decides to give her blessing to Connie and Jacob's relationship. The three are overjoyed, and Connie and Grace drive home together. Carmel's mother gives chase and forces them off a cliff. They are each thrown from the car but miraculously they survive. Due to the extent of her injuries and the location, Grace is airlifted to the ED. Catastrophically, a drone collides with the helicopter and it crashes into the entrance, worsening her condition. The second accident causes a subdural haematoma that sends her into a coma, and the outlook is not promising. The shock of this leaves Connie traumatised, and she spends almost all of her time at Grace's bedside. Finally, after several weeks, Connie witnesses Grace slowly awaken from her coma. Grace emerges from the coma conscious but withdrawn and nearly mute; the first word she is seen saying after she awakes is 'skate' upon seeing a snow globe. Grace is unable to walk and can barely even eat by herself. Under her mother's care at home and through physical therapy, she slowly starts to recover, eventually regaining the ability to walk with the aid of a crutch. Connie holds Elle Gardner responsible for Grace's condition and brings her daughter along to the disciplinary hearing againstLater in January on the night before Elle's tribunal, Grace collapsed whilst trying to walk to the toilet. The following day, Connie tried to over-emphasise Grace's injuries by forcing her to observe in a wheelchair, against the advice of Sam. During the tribunal Connie embellished her version of events and slandered Elle in her speech, and Grace left the room disgusted. In the toilets, she destroyed a mirror with one of her crutches in anger before falling on the fragments suffering a tonic-clonic seizure and severing an artery. Elle soon found Grace and called for help. Connie later arrived at the scene, and was initially reluctant to let Elle treat her. Elle fitted a catheter into Grace's neck to stop the bleeding before she was rushed to the ED. Grace was taken to have a CT scan and it was revealed that she sustained no further serious cerebral injuries but she may have developed epilepsy, to Connie and Sam's horror, and she later underwent surgery. After waking up, Grace was not communicating with Connie nor Sam. The scans confirmed that Grace has epilepsy. Sam initially thought the reasoning behind Grace not talking was due to PTSD or just as a silent protest. The following week just as Connie and Sam were preparing to take her home, Grace showed Connie her tablet screen with the words \\"This is all your fault,\\" written on it, implying that she blamed Connie for what happened to her. =Mercedes Christie= Mercedes Christie, played by Hannah Spearritt, made her first screen appearance on 23 January 2016.

Alison Graham, writing for the Radio Times, branded the Ellisson family \\"Holby’s tiny band of violently industrious fascists\\" and called Mickey \\"gormless\\" and a \\"dope\\", quipping he is \\"too dumb to draw breath\\".

Scientific career Winder received his early education at Belvedere College, and developed an early interest in botany and zoology, cycling around the Irish countryside looking for interesting specimens. In 1945 he entered University College Dublin (UCD) to study science and came to the attention of Arthur Stelfox of the Natural History Museum. Stelfox introduced Winder to entomologist Philip Graves, who promptly sent the 18-year-old Winder off to the mountains of Kerry in search of a rare butterfly, but Winder returned with a specimen of a dragonfly, Cordulia aenea, which was previously unknown in Ireland.universityscience.ie – profile of Frank Winder While climbing a steep gully on Knocknagantee in Kerry in search of a rare fern, Winder sustained a long fall but luckily was not seriously injured. It was that fall which made him realise that he would need to acquire rock-climbing skills if he was to explore cliffs in relative safety. (He later revisited the site of his fall, establishing a new rock-climb on the neighbouring buttress.) Winder graduated from UCD with a BSc in biochemistry in 1948 and an MSc the following year. In 1950, after a brief period working for Glaxo, he joined a Medical Research Council research laboratory in Trinity College Dublin working on the chemotherapy of tuberculosis, under the leadership of Vincent Barry. The team developed a class of phenazines that proved very effective in the treatment of TB and leprosy, and remain in use worldwide. Winder also pioneered research into the primary anti-TB drug, isoniazid; his work on this continues to be cited internationally.Graham S. Timmins, Vojo Deretic (2006) Mechanisms of action of isoniazid; Molecular Microbiology 62 (5), 1220–1227; In Trinity, he became a lecturer in biochemistry in 1960, a fellow of the college in 1962, reader in 1966, dean of Graduate Studies 1974 to 1977 and professor in 1975. He was conferred with the degree of Doctor of Science in 1972. He served as director of the Biology Teaching Centre from 1986 to 1991 and was co-opted to Senior Fellowship in 1985. He served on the Board of College where he made contributions to the debates on policy and other business. He retired in 1996, but continued to come to college every day until shortly before his death. In the 1950s Winder was one of the founders of Tuairim, a group of young professionals who formed a think-tank to examine the problems affecting Ireland at the time, especially that of emigration. He was elected to membership of the Royal Irish Academy in 1961 and held the office of vice-president three times. Climbing career Frank Winder joined the Irish Mountaineering Club (IMC) shortly after its founding in 1948, and quickly became one of its leading members.J. Lynam and P.O'Neill (editors), IMC50: The Golden Jubilee of the Irish Mountaineering Club, (IMC 1998) He established many new rock-climbs in various parts of Ireland, especially in counties Wicklow, Donegal, and Galway.

(or John Ponce or, in the Latinate form, Johannes Poncius)John Punch; Johannes Poncius (1603–1661) was an Irish Franciscan scholastic philosopher and theologian. Punch was ultimately responsible for the now classic formulation of Ockham's Razor, in the shape of the Latin phrase entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem, \\"entities are not to be multiplied unnecessarily.\\"A. C. Crombie, Medieval and Early Modern Science II (1959 edition) pg. 30. His formulation was slightly different: Non sunt multiplicanda entia sine necessitate.Johannes Poncius’s commentary on John Duns Scotus's Opus Oxoniense, book III, dist. 34, q. 1. in John Duns Scotus Opera Omnia, vol.15, Ed. Luke Wadding, Louvain (1639), reprinted Paris: Vives, (1894) p.483a Punch did not attribute this wording to William of Ockham, but instead referred to the principle as a \\"common axiom\\" (axioma vulgare) used by the Scholastics. Life His name was John Punch, but he is often known as \\"Ponce\\", which was a derivation of the Latin form of his surname: Poncius. At an early age, he went to Belgium and entered the novitiate of the Irish Franciscans in St. Antony's College, Louvain. He studied philosophy at Cologne, began the study of theology in Louvain, under Hugh Ward, O.F.M. and John Colgan, O.F.M., was called by Luke Wadding to Rome, and admitted 7 September 1625 into the College of St. Isidore, which had just been founded for the education of Irish Franciscan friars. After receiving his degrees he was appointed to teach philosophy and later, theology in St. Isidore's. He lectured afterwards at Lyons and Paris, where he was held in great repute for his learning. Punch succeeded Father Martin Walsh in governing Ludovisi College at Rome for the education of Irish secular priests; and for some time he filled the position of superior of St. Isidore. He had a passionate love of his country and was an active agent in Rome of the Irish Confederate Catholics. When dissensions arose among the Confederates, and when Richard Bellings, secretary to the Supreme Council, published his Vindiciæ (Paris, 1652), attacking the Irish Catholics who remained faithful to the nuncio, Father Punch promptly answered with his \\"Vindiciae Eversae\\" (Paris, 1652). He had already warned the Confederates not to trust the Royalists. In a letter (2 July 1644) to the agent of the Catholics, Hugo de Burgo, he says: :\\"the English report that the king will not give satisfaction to our commissioners (from the Confederates) though he keep them in expectation and to delay them for his own interest\\". Works In 1643 he published in Rome his Cursus philosophiæ. Some of his opinions were opposed by Mastrius, and Punch replied in Appendix apologeticus (Rome, 1645), in which he says that although he accepts all the conclusions of Duns Scotus, he does not feel called upon to adopt all Scotus's proofs. Mastrius acknowledged the force of Punch's reasoning and admitted that he had shed light on many philosophical problems. In 1652, Punch published \\"Integer cursus theologiæ\\" (Paris). These two works explain with great clearness and precision the teaching of the Scotistic school. In 1661, he published at Paris his great work, \\"Commentarii theologici in quatuor libros sententiarum\\", called by Hurter opus rarissimum. Punch also assisted Luke Wadding in editing the works of Scotus. Wadding says that he was endowed with a powerful and subtle intellect, a great facility of communicating knowledge, a graceful style, and that though immersed in the severer studies of philosophy and theology he was an ardent student of the classics. His other works are: *\\"Judicium doctrinæ SS. Augustini et Thomæ\\", Paris, 1657; *\\"Scotus Hiberniae restitutus\\", in answer to Father Angelus of St. Francis Mason, who claimed Scotus as an Englishman; *\\"Deplorabilis populi Hibernici pro religione, rege et libertate status\\" (Paris, 1651).

He won both the Coretta Scott King Award, as illustrator, and the Ezra Jack Keats New Illustrator Award for Uptown (Holt, 2000), the first book he both wrote and illustrated. He has won six King Awards as illustrator and he is a four-time Caldecott honor recipient. For his lifetime contribution as a children's illustrator, Collier is U.S. nominee for the biennial, international Hans Christian Andersen Award in 2014.  Biography  Bryan Collier was raised in Pocomoke City near the southern border of Maryland Eastern Shore. As a child he had a great collection of quality children's books that his mom, a Head Start teacher, would bring home. Some of his favorites were, Whistle for Willie by Ezra Jack Keats, Snowy Day by Keats, Harold and the Purple Crayon by Crockett Johnson, and Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak. He said that he wouldn't read the books at first; he would only look at the images to tell him the story. Collier started working with watercolors and photo collage when he was 15 years old. He said it was something that sort of clicked in him overnight and the next day he starting painting. While in high school he won first place in a Congressional Competition and his painting was displayed in the Capitol Building in Washington D.C. for a year. Collier received a scholarship through a national talent competition through the Pratt Institute in New York City, one of the leading art schools in the United States. He later graduated from Pratt with honors. While at Pratt, he was a volunteer at the Harlem Horizon Art Studio located within the Harlem Hospital Center. The center is open to the children of the hospital as well as the children of the community. He later became the Program Director, a position he held for twelve years. Collier said that one of the biggest reasons for wanting to become a part of children's books was because of an experience he had in 1995 at a book store where the books he saw did not look or feel or sound like him or his children. He thought that he could do better, so that's what he worked towards. Today Collier continues to be active at the Harlem Horizon Art Studio but now as a volunteer. He believes it's important to be a positive role model for kids. He says, \\"It gives the community, the schools, the kids, and the parents the opportunity to come together for a very positive uplifting cause—the building and re-building of self-esteem, teaching the appreciation of art, and keeping the kids connected and involved and away from negative influences.\\" He also spends time visiting schools to talk with teachers, librarians, and students about books and art. Illustration style Collier uses a unique technique of combining watercolors with collage. The first thing he does before creating the illustrations is a photo shoot of either his family or friends acting out the story. Sometimes he uses up to ten rolls of film. He believes that by having people act out the story, it shows him the important gestures that illuminate the scenes. Next, he carefully selects some of the photographs that best fit the text and begins sketching. After the sketching is complete, he begins painting in watercolor and the collage follows. He gets pieces for his collage mostly from magazines like Elle.  Awards  Collier is a four-time recipient of a Caldecott Honor: Martin's Big Words, Rosa, Dave the Potter, and Trombone Shorty. Those four books are among nine for which Collier has received Coretta Scott King Award recognition as the winner or honor recipient. The annual King Awards, one for an illustrator and one for a writer, recognize the year's \\"most distinguished portrayal of African American experience in literature for children or teens\\".

Following the success of \\"EHV\\", a second programme was published – Social and Emotional Education (\\"SEE\\"), primarily for ages 12 to 14+ but it has also proved constructive for older children identified as likely to benefit from help getting their lives 'back on track'.

Besides this there are two elective subjects that partly deal with values education: Religions and Ethics (for 7th, 8th, and 9th grade) and Philosophy for children (Critical thinking, Ethical exploring, Me and the other; for 7th, 8th, and 9th grade). Slovenian educational system does not require special training in the field of values education for teachers that teach mentioned subjects . =Sweden= Values education is a part of Swedish schools. Whereas the formal curricula is about educating students to be competent democratic citizens by practising student participation, qualitative studies have shown that in everyday school life, values education and school democracy often appeared to be reduced to traditional disciplining with high focus on rules and regulations.Thornberg, R.

Hong Kong: Hong Kong Institute of Educational Research, Chinese University Press =United Kingdom= Since 1988 the British government, although not recognising or calling it values education, has promoted and respected values in the guise of spiritual, moral, social and cultural development (SMSCD) leaving the initiative to individual schools to decide how values education standards should be met. It is not clear whether there are standards of values education. The Government and state school systems have never called it \\"values education.\\" Values education courses in Britain may be implemented in the form of government supported campaigns such as Social & Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL,The Standards Site: Social and emotional aspects of learning... improving behaviour… improving learning but are more often provided by local experts in the form of LVEP.

Its first incarnation was as a subject centre of the Learning and Teaching Support Network (2000-2004), then a subject centre of the Higher Education Academy (2004-2011). Its second incarnation was as an enterprise unit of the University of Southampton. LTSN/ HEA Subject Centre for Languages, Linguistics and Area Studies 2000-2011 The Subject Centre for Languages, Linguistics and Area Studies, (also known as LLAS) was one of 24 subject centres of the Higher Education Academy in the United Kingdom. Formed in 2000 as part of the Learning and Teaching Support Network (LTSN), LLAS was hosted by the University of Southampton 2000-2011, jointly with the University of Hull, 2000-2003. In 2004 the functions of LTSN were incorporated into the newly formed Higher Education Academy. It had a UK-wide remit to support teachers of languages, linguistics and area studies in UK higher education. It was funded via the Higher Education Funding Council for England, the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, the Scottish Funding Council and the Department for Employment and Learning (Northern Ireland}. LLAS activities were supported and informed by a number of advisory committees, made up of academics representing languages, linguistics and area studies disciplines. The largest of these committees was the Advisory Board, but there were also Specialist Advisory groups for each of the three subject areas. There were advisory groups for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and a number of special interest groups (SIGs) including 'literature and culture' and a group for teachers of \\"Less Widely Used Less Taught\\" languages (LWULT). LLAS had a partnership with CILT, The National Centre for Languages. The Director of LLAS was Michael Kelly OBE, who is also Emeritus Professor of French at Southampton University. Other staff included a team of academic co-ordinators, a web development team, and an administration team.

She started her career as a graphic artist for television, but transitioned to writing and designing children's books in the 1970s.  Early Life  Gibbons was born in Oak Park, Illinois in 1944, and she was described as exhibiting \\"artistic talents at an early age.\\" She gained a reputation in school as an artist, eventually creating her own small books that she personally described as \\"writing and drawing pictures of what I loved and where I wanted to be.\\" She often visited the Chicago Art Institute nearby which likely fueled her passion for art. She studied graphic design at the University of Illinois. Gibbons herself quoted in the Something about the Author Autobiography Series, \\"I consider myself quite fortunate because I never had to debate with myself as to what I wanted to do with my life. The answer was always there. I wanted to be a writer and artist.\\" Gibbons was inspired by one of her professors at the University of Illinois who was a professional children's book illustrator. When she was 21, she married Glenn Gibbons, and started her first job with a television station in Champaign, Illinois. She worked on children's show designing on-air graphics and set design. Later, the couple moved to Chicago, and Gibbons continued her work with the TV station, WMAQ-TV while also picking up jobs in advertising. In 1969, she moved to New York City, worked for WNBC-TV, and ended up designing a few graphics for Saturday Night Live. In 1971, she became the graphic designer for Take a Giant Step, a children's television program on NBC. In 1972, Gail Gibbon's husband, Glenn, died in a car accident, which inevitably sparked her career. She submitted her first portfolio to an agent, who encouraged her to pursue a career in children's literature.  Career  Gail Gibbons first book was Willy and His Wheel Wagon,Children's book author and illustrator, Gail Gibbon a 32-page self-illustrated picture book published by Prentice-Hall. By 1978, Gibbons had published 5 children's books, including Things to Make and Do for Halloween and Salvador and Mister Sam: A Guide to Parakeet Care. By 1979, Gibbons was pushed to publish solely non-fiction children's books, and she released Clocks and How They Go, which exhibits a more direct teaching style in writing. Gibbons continued with this style of writing, growing into a prolific non-fiction children's book author and illustrator. Some of her books were even chosen as Reading Rainbow selections.

Overview The book examines the full cost of the Iraq War, including many hidden costs. The book also discusses the extent to which these costs will be imposed for many years to come, paying special attention to the expenditures that will be required to care for wounded veterans. The authors conclude by illustrating the opportunity cost of the resources spent on waging the war. The book was a New York Times and international best-seller and has been translated into 22 languages. The total cost of $3 trillion is comparable to that found in other studies. The Joint Economic Committee of Congress estimated that the war would cost $3.5 trillion, while the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office projected that the total cost will reach between $1.4 and $2.2 trillion. The Stiglitz-Bilmes work builds on an earlier study by Yale economist William Nordhaus, who predicted in 2002 that the war could reach $2 trillion if it went badly.War in Iraq: Costs, Consequences and Alternatives Numerous economists, including James K. Galbraith of the University of Texas and Nobel Laureate Lawrence Klein have supported the methodology in the book. Economist Fred Foldvary also wrote a positive review of the book in Econ Journal Watch in 2008. He believes better knowledge of both the budgeted and implicit costs of the war as spelled out in the book will further a more coherent dialogue on present and future related policy matters. Criticism In a 2006 review, economist Alan Krueger argued the estimate was too high for three reasons. First, it counts future interest payments on the debt created by military spending as well as the direct expenditures, which is double counting. Second, it counts increased military recruitment costs that incorporate a premium for higher risk of death or injury and the direct cost of the deaths and injuries, which is also double counting. Third, it attributes a global increase in the price of oil entirely to the Iraq War. Other academics, including John Lott, Richard Zerbe, and Edgar Browing, echoed those criticisms, and in addition challenged the Lancet surveys of Iraq War casualties to determine the number of Iraqi deaths.

The company, which once occupied the One World Financial Center building in Manhattan, now bases its operations at 85 Broad Street in New York City. History Originally created as Oppenheimer & Company, Oppenheimer Holdings was founded in 1950 when a partnership was created to act as a broker-dealer and manage related financial services for large institutional clients. While the 1960s and 1970s was a time of great prosperity for the company, the origins of the firm trace back to 1881. After re-configuring operations in 1975, Oppenheimer & Co. formed three operating subsidiaries: * Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., a retail brokerage firm * Oppenheimer Capital Corporation, an institutional investment manager * Oppenheimer Management Corp. (subsequently spun off and acquired by Invesco) In the 1980s, OpCo founding partners began looking for a buyer. Mercantile House Holdings, PLC, a publicly owned British corporation, made an offer in 1982, which was accepted and closed a year later. In 1986, a majority interest was bought in Oppenheimer & Co. and Oppenheimer Capital by the firm's management, Chairman and CEO Stephen Robert and president Nathan Gantcher, along with a small group of their colleagues from Mercantile, for $150 million. A year later, British & Commonwealth Holdings, PLC, acquired Mercantile. The 1990s brought another separation of the original firm when Oppenheimer Capital's senior personnel acquired a majority interest in the subsidiary and separated from OpCo. In 1995, Robert and Gantcher, who controlled about 40 percent of OpCo's equity, became eager to locate additional capital to grow their firm. At first, OpCo explored options of forming a possible alliance with ING Groep NV that eventually fell through. Carrying on with this goal, management set out to merge with a bulge bracket bank that had access to the foreign markets. Robert and Gantcher entertained offers from the second-largest private German financial institution and retail bank, Bayerische Vereinsbank. On May 8, 1997, The Wall Street Journal announced that Pittsburgh-based PNC Bank Corp. was in talks to buy Oppenheimer & Co. for about $500 million in cash, stock, and options. Despite that, according to the article's source, PNC and Oppenheimer hadn't arrived at a fixed price and that chatter could break the formal agreement. 13 days following the announcement, the Bloomberg News desk announced that for the third time in two years, OpCo had been abandoned by a prospective buyer. Two months later, it was announced that CIBC wanted to expand its brokerage business and was interested in Oppenheimer. =CIBC Oppenheimer= In 1997, CIBC Wood Gundy acquired Oppenheimer Holdings for $525 million and paid over for the next three years and included $175 million in order to retain the loyalty of key Oppenheimer executives who were not shareholders in the closely held private firm. When the deal was closed, the firm's name was changed to CIBC Oppenheimer Holdings. In 2003, CIBC made the decision to sell Oppenheimer's retail brokerage business and name for $257 million to Fahnestock Viner Holdings, which subsequently changed its name to Oppenheimer. =Fahnestock Viner holdings= Fahnestock Viner traces its lineage back to Harris C. Fahnestock, an investment banker who was a founding member of one of Citigroup's predecessors, the First National Bank of New York. In 1881, Harris' son William formed his own investment bank at Two Wall Street, Fahnestock & Co., which expanded through the decades and was eventually acquired in 1988 by E.A. Viner Holdings, Ltd. The new company, Fahnestock Viner Holdings, would eventually change its name in 2003 upon the acquisition of CIBC Oppenheimer's retail brokerage business (the Private Client and U.S. Asset Management Divisions). =CIBC World Markets= On November 4, 2007, CIBC announced that it agreed to sell to Oppenheimer & Co. its American domestic investment banking, equities, leveraged finance, and related debt capital markets businesses. The transaction also included CIBC's Israeli investment banking and equities business, and certain parts of other U.S. capital markets-related businesses located in the UK and Asia. The acquired businesses by Oppenheimer had over 700 employees and annual revenue of 400 million. According to the agreement, Oppenheimer borrowed $100 million from CIBC in the form of a subordinated debt. Additionally, CIBC agreed to provide an initial $1.5 billion lending, to the entity for financing the syndicated loans for American middle-market companies. CIBC President and Chief Executive Gerry McCaughey said, \\"It [transaction] will permit CIBC to redeploy capital over time to further support the continued growth of our strong and profitable U.S. and international operations, as well as our core Canadian businesses.\\" The deal was closed on January 14, 2008. =Settlements with US regulators= In January 2015, Oppenheimer & Co. paid $20 million in civil settlements with U.S. regulators.  Ownership  As of 2020, the company has Class A non- voting stock which is publicly-traded, while 98% of the Class B voting stock is owned by its chairman Albert G. Lowenthal.

John, the father was a civil engineer as well as an architect. Although they did carry out some commissions separately, they were given joint credit for many of their projects, and it is difficult to attribute much of their work to a single individual. In general, John Green worked on civil engineering projects, such as road and rail bridges, whereas Benjamin worked on projects that were more purely architectural. Their work was predominantly church and railway architecture, with a sprinkling of public buildings that includes their masterpiece, Newcastle's Theatre Royal. Drawings by John and Benjamin Green are held by the Laing Art Gallery in Newcastle upon Tyne. Biographies =John Green= The front of the Literary and Philosophical Society building in Newcastle, designed by John Green John Green was born on 29 June 1787 at Newton Fell House, Nafferton, two miles north of Ovington, Northumberland. He was the son of Benjamin Green, a carpenter and maker of agricultural implements. After finishing school, he worked in his father's business. The firm moved to the market town of Corbridge and began general building work with young John concentrating on architectural work. About 1820, John set up business as an architect and civil engineer in nearby Newcastle upon Tyne. Holy Trinity Church, Cambo, by John and Benjamin Green John Green married Jane Stobart in 1805, and they had two sons, John (c.1807–68) and Benjamin (c1811-58), both of whom became architects. Little is known about the career of John, but Benjamin worked in partnership with his father on many projects. In 1822 John Green designed a new building for the Newcastle Literary and Philosophical Society. The building, which houses the society's substantial library, is still in use today. He also designed a number of farmhouses, being employed on the Beaufront estate near Hexham and also on the Duke of Northumberland’s estates. John Green was principally a civil engineer, and built several road and rail bridges. In 1829–31 he built two wrought-iron suspension bridges crossing the Tyne (at Scotswood) and the Tees (at Whorlton). The bridge at Scotswood was demolished in 1967 but the one at Whorlton still survives. When the High Level Bridge at Newcastle was proposed ten years later, John Green submitted plans, but those of Robert Stephenson were accepted by the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway. Green also built a number of bridges using an innovative system of laminated timber arches on masonry piers, the Weibeking system, based on the work of Bavarian engineer C.F. Weibeking. The two he built for the Newcastle and North Shields Railway, at the Ouseburn and at Willington Quay remain in use, though the timbers were replaced with wrought iron in a similar lattice pattern in 1869. In 1840 he was elected to the Institution of Civil Engineers, and in 1841 he was awarded the institution's Telford Medal for his work on laminated arch design. John Green died in Newcastle on 30 September 1852. =Benjamin Green= Theatre Royal on Grey Street, Newcastle Grey's Monument in the centre of Newcastle Benjamin Green was a pupil of Augustus Charles Pugin, father of the more famous Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin. In the mid-1830s he became a partner of his father and remained so until the latter's death in 1852. The two partners differed somewhat. John has been described as a 'plain, practical, shrewd man of business' with a 'plain, severe and economical' style, whereas Benjamin was 'an artistic, dashing sort of fellow', with a style that was 'ornamental, florid and costly'. The Greens worked as railway architects and it is believed that all the main line stations between Newcastle and Berwick upon Tweed were designed by Benjamin. In 2020 Morpeth Station was restored to Green's original designs following a £2.3M investment. They also designed a number of Northumbrian churches, the best examples being at Earsdon and Cambo. The Green's most important commissions in Newcastle were the Theatre Royal (1836–37) and the column for Grey's Monument (1837–38). Both of these structures were part of the re-development of Newcastle city centre in neo- classical style by Richard Grainger, and both exist today. Although both of the partners were credited with their design, it is believed that Benjamin was the person responsible. Penshaw Monument, County Durham Another well-known structure designed by the Greens is Penshaw Monument (1844). This is a folly standing on Penshaw Hill in County Durham. It was built as a half-sized replica of the renowned Temple of Hephaestus in Athens, and was dedicated to John George Lambton, first Earl of Durham and the first Governor of the Province of Canada.

He serves as a tenured professor at University of California, Los Angeles, and is the inaugural holder of the Abdus Salam Chair at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS). He is best known for pioneering RF CMOS technology during the late 1980s to early 1990s. As of 2008, the radio transceivers in all wireless networking devices and modern mobile phones are mass-produced as RF CMOS devices. Abidi received his B.S. from the Imperial College London followed by a M.S. and PhD from the University of California, Berkeley in 1981. He worked as an electrical engineer with Bell Labs and in January 1985 joined UCLA as a tenured academic. In 2007, he left for a three- year sabbatical to work as a founding dean of the engineering school at Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) and returned to Los Angeles in 2009. In 2017, he was named as the inaugural holder of the Abdus Salam Chair at LUMS. Abidi is a prominent academic and is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and The World Academy of Sciences. He received the IEEE Donald O. Pederson Award in Solid-State Circuits in 2008. In 2015, UC, Berkeley recognised him as a distinguished alumnus for his contributions to the theory and practice of analog and RF circuits. Life and education Born and raised in Pakistan, Abidi was educated till matriculation at Cadet College Hasan Abdal, Pakistan, completed his high school from Dudley College of Technology, UK, and gained a B.Sc. degree (with first-class honours) in electrical engineering at Imperial College, London, in 1976. Later he attended University of California, Berkeley; he gained an M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering in 1978 and a Ph.D in 1981 under the supervision of Robert Meyer. Abidi is an IEEE Fellow and a member of the United States National Academy of Engineering (NAE). He joined LUMS (Lahore University of Management Sciences) School of Science and Engineering as its first dean. Academic career Since 1985, Abidi has worked at UCLA, where he is currently a Distinguished Chancellor's Professor. From 1981 to 1984, he worked for Bell Laboratories as a Member of Technical Staff at the Advanced LSI Development Laboratory. He was a Visiting Faculty Researcher at Hewlett Packard Laboratories in 1989. He is one of only a few Pakistani-origin members of the NAE. and was recognized as an ISSCC top- ten author. While working at Bell and then UCLA, he pioneered radio research in metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) technology and made seminal contributions to radio architecture based on complementary MOS (CMOS) switched-capacitor (SC) technology. While working at Bell in the early 1980s, he worked on the development of sub-micron MOSFET (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor) VLSI (very large-scale integration) technology at the Advanced LSI Development Lab, along with Marty Lepselter, George E. Smith and Harry Bol. As one of the few circuit designers at the lab, Abidi demonstrated the potential of sub-micron NMOS integrated circuit technology in high-speed communication circuits, and developed the first MOS amplifiers for Gb/s data rates in optical fiber receivers. Abidi's work was initially met with skepticism from proponents of GaAs and bipolar junction transistors, the dominant technologies for high-speed circuits at the time. In 1985 he joined UCLA, where he pioneered RF CMOS technology during the late 1980s to early 1990s. His work changed the way in which RF circuits would be designed, away from discrete bipolar transistors and towards CMOS integrated circuits. He was a visiting researcher at HP Labs for a year in 1989, during which time he investigated A/D conversion at ultra-high speeds, before returning to UCLA and researching analog signal chains for disk drive read channels, high-speed A/D conversion, and analog CMOS circuits for signal processing and communications. Abidi, along with UCLA colleagues J. Chang and Michael Gaitan, demonstrated the first RF CMOS amplifier in 1993. In 1995, Abidi used CMOS switched-capacitor technology to demonstrate the first direct-conversion transceivers for digital communications. In the late 1990s, the RF CMOS technology that he pioneered was widely adopted in wireless networking, as mobile phones began entering widespread use. As of 2008, the radio transceivers in all wireless networking devices and modern mobile phones are mass-produced as RF CMOS devices. Abidi served as the Program Secretary for the IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) from 1984 to 1990, and was the General Chairman of the Symposium on VLSI Circuits in 1992. He was the Secretary of the IEEE Solid-State Circuits Council from 1990 to 1991. From 1992 to 1995, he was the Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits.

Located in the heart of eastern Dubai in Deira, Al Muraqqabat is bordered by the localities of Al Rigga, Al Muteena and Al Khabisi. Although a predominantly residential area, Al Muraqqabat also has many shopping malls, hotels and restaurants. As a residential area, Al Muraqqabat has the third-highest population density in the city of Dubai (after Ayil Nasir and Naif). The locality is bounded to the north by route D 88 (Omar bin Khattab Road) and to the south by route E 11 (Abu Baker Al Siddique Road). Al Muraqqabat Road divides the locality into two sub-sections, the western flank of which is primarily residential, while the eastern flank is more commercial, with banks, hotels and restaurants located in it. Fish Roundabout, located at the northwestern periphery of Al Muraqqabat is an important landmark in Deira. Additionally, other landmarks in the locality include Al Ghurair City, Hamarain Centre, Warba Centre, JW Marriott, Al Muraqqabat Police Station, the head offices of Mashreq Bank and Al-Futtaim Group, Ansar gallery departmental store and Reef mall. There are famous restaurants like Samad Iraqi, Aroos Damascus and Al Shami Lebanese, Bait al Mandi Yemeni, Puranmal Indian veg, Gulf pastry Arabic pizza, and some Arabic sweets shop, Domino's Pizza. Like many parts of Deira, Al Muraqqabat is a primarily South Asian community. The locality follows a grid plan, with even- numbered streets running northwest–southeast through the locality, starting with 2nd Street, near route D 80 (Salahuddin Road) and ending with 30 Road (Al Rigga Road). Odd numbered streets run perpendicular to even-numbered streets in a southwest–northeast direction, beginning with 1st Street in the northern periphery of the locality (near Fish Roundabout), and ending with 45th Street (near Hamarain Centre and route D 78). Al Rigga is a twin locality of Al Muraqqabat as the grid system of local roads from Al Muraqqabat continues to progress into Al Rigga. Al Rigga is parallel to Al Murraqabat and Al Rigga. Al Rigga is important centre of entertainment and shopping during the Dubai Shopping Festival (DSF).

He was born, raised and spent his rugby playing career in New Zealand, but has lived and worked in Ireland for most of his broadcasting career. Playing career Brent Pope played for various provincial and New Zealand underage teams before representing Mid Canterbury and then Canterbury. Playing for Lincoln University Pope then moved to Otago University and for the next decade played for Otago at New Zealand first division level, helping Otago to its first ever first division national title in 1991. Pope played nearly 100 first class games for New Zealand in a career that spanned nearly 10 years with the Dunedin-based side, during that time he formed potent loose forward trios with the likes of All Blacks Paul Henderson, Mike Brewer, Josh Kronfeld, Arran Pene and Jamie Joseph. Pope was selected in the original 1987 New Zealand Rugby World Cup training squad, but had to withdraw a week before the tournament began due to a serious elbow injury in the final series of All Black trials, he was then replaced by a young Auckland No 8 by the name of Zinzan Brooke. Pope came back after injury to be nominated as one of New Zealand's outstanding domestic players of that year 1987, Pope was named Otago player of the year in 1987/8 and was again shortlisted for the All Blacks tour to Japan at the end of that year only to miss out again when the tour party was trimmed to just 24 players. Pope played in a number of final All Black trials from 1987-1992, represented the South Island, New Zealand Schools, Universities, Leinster, Barbarians, New Zealand selection XV, International XV and was a Captain of the Penguins. Pope also played county provincial representative rugby in England and United States (OMBAC) He came to Ireland in 1991 where he played and later coached St Marys, Clontarf F.C. and Leinster A. Coaching career Pope successfully coached both St Marys and Clontarf to 3 separate National Division AIL Rugby titles, 3 All Ireland Floodlit Cups, and 2 Leinster Senior Cups, the first in Clontarf since the 1956) Pope was the first ever Leinster-based Coach to win the AIB League First Division title with St Marys RFC in 1999/2000, he also coached at senior provincial level with Leinster B in 2000, and established the Irish Shamrocks, a touring Irish team to New Zealand for promising Irish club players. Rugby Pundit Pope featured regularly as a rugby pundit on RTE, with presenter Tom McGurk and George Hook, in the coverage of Six Nations, International and Heineken Cup matches. Celebrity Brent has worked for RTÉ Sport for over 23 years and has also appeared in many crossover programmes such as The Restaurant, The Den, The Afternoon Show, The Hook and Popey Roadshow, The Late Late Show, The Saturday Night Show, and various Travel programmes.

Until the vulnerability is mitigated, hackers can exploit it to adversely affect computer programs, data, additional computers or a network.Compare: An exploit directed at a zero-day is called a zero-day exploit, or zero-day attack. The term \\"zero-day\\" originally referred to the number of days since a new piece of software was released to the public, so \\"zero-day\\" software was software that had been obtained by hacking into a developer's computer before release. Eventually the term was applied to the vulnerabilities that allowed this hacking, and to the number of days that the vendor has had to fix them. Once the vendor learns of the vulnerability, the vendor will usually create patches or advise workarounds to mitigate it. The more recently that the vendor has become aware of the vulnerability, the more likely that no fix or mitigation has been developed. Even after a fix is developed, the fewer the days since then, the higher the probability that an attack against the afflicted software will be successful, because not every user of that software will have applied the fix. For zero-day exploits, unless the vulnerability is inadvertently fixed, e.g. by an unrelated update that happens to fix the vulnerability, the probability that a user has applied a vendor-supplied patch that fixes the problem is zero, so the exploit would remain available. Zero- day attacks are a severe threat.The Man Who Found Stuxnet – Sergey Ulasen in the Spotlight published on November 2, 2011  Attack vectors  Malware writers can exploit zero-day vulnerabilities through several different attack vectors. Sometimes, when users visit rogue websites, malicious code on the site can exploit vulnerabilities in Web browsers. Web browsers are a particular target for criminals because of their widespread distribution and usage. Cybercriminals, as well as international vendors of spyware such as Israel’s NSO Group, can also send malicious e-mail attachments via SMTP, which exploit vulnerabilities in the application opening the attachment. Exploits that take advantage of common file types are numerous and frequent, as evidenced by their increasing appearances in databases like US-CERT. Criminals can engineer malware to take advantage of these file type exploits to compromise attacked systems or steal confidential data.  Window of vulnerability  The time from when a software exploit first becomes active to the time when the number of vulnerable systems shrinks to insignificance is known as the Window of Vulnerability (WoV). The time-line for each software vulnerability is defined by the following main events: * t0: The vulnerability is discovered (by anyone). * t1a: A security patch is published (e.g., by the software vendor). * t1b: An exploit becomes active. * t2: Most vulnerable systems have applied the patch. Thus the formula for the length of the Window of Vulnerability is: t2 – t1b In this formulation, it is always true that t0 ≤ t1a and t0 ≤ t1b. Note that t0 is not the same as Day Zero. For example, if a hacker is the first to discover (at t0) the vulnerability, the vendor might not learn of it until much later (on Day Zero). For normal vulnerabilities, t1b – t1a > 0. This implies that the software vendor was aware of vulnerability and had time to publish a security patch (t1a) before any hacker could craft a workable exploit (t1b). For zero-day exploits, t1b – t1a ≤ 0 so that the exploit became active before a patch was made available. By not disclosing known vulnerabilities, a software vendor hopes to reach t2 before t1b is reached, thus avoiding any exploits. However, the vendor has no guarantees that hackers will not find vulnerabilities on their own. Furthermore, hackers can analyze the security patches themselves, and thereby discover the underlying vulnerabilities and automatically generate working exploits. These exploits can be used effectively up until time t2. In practice, the size of the WoV varies between systems, vendors, and individual vulnerabilities. It is often measured in days, with one report from 2006 estimating the average as 28 days.\\"Internet Security Threat Report\\" Symantec Corp, Vol. X, Sept. 2006, p. 12  Protection  Zero-day protection is the ability to provide protection against zero-day exploits. Since zero-day attacks are generally unknown to the public it is often difficult to defend against them. Zero-day attacks are often effective against \\"secure\\" networks and can remain undetected even after they are launched. Thus, users of so- called secure systems must also exercise common sense and practice safe computing habits. Many techniques exist to limit the effectiveness of zero-day memory corruption vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows. These protection mechanisms exist in contemporary operating systems such as macOS, Windows Vista and beyond (see also: Security and safety features new to Windows Vista), Solaris, Linux, Unix, and Unix-like environments; Windows XP Service Pack 2 includes limited protection against generic memory corruption vulnerabilities and previous versions include even less. Desktop and server protection software also exists to mitigate zero-day buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Typically these technologies involve heuristic termination analysis—stopping them before they cause any harm. It has been suggested that a solution of this kind may be out of reach because it is algorithmically impossible in the general case to analyze any arbitrary code to determine if it is malicious, as such an analysis reduces to the halting problem over a linear bounded automaton, which is unsolvable. It is, however, unnecessary to address the general case (that is, to sort all programs into the categories of malicious or non-malicious) under most circumstances in order to eliminate a wide range of malicious behaviors. It suffices to recognize the safety of a limited set of programs (e.g., those that can access or modify only a given subset of machine resources) while rejecting both some safe and all unsafe programs. This does require the integrity of those safe programs to be maintained, which may prove difficult in the face of a kernel level exploit. The Zeroday Emergency Response Team (ZERT) was a group of software engineers who worked to release non-vendor patches for zero-day exploits.  Worms  Zero-day worms take advantage of a surprise attack while they are still unknown to computer security professionals. Recent history shows an increasing rate of worm propagation. Well designed worms can spread very fast with devastating consequences to the Internet and other systems.  Ethics  Differing ideologies exist relative to the collection and use of zero-day vulnerability information. Many computer security vendors perform research on zero-day vulnerabilities in order to better understand the nature of vulnerabilities and their exploitation by individuals, computer worms and viruses. Alternatively, some vendors purchase vulnerabilities to augment their research capacity. An example of such a program is TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative. While selling and buying these vulnerabilities is not technically illegal in most parts of the world, there is a lot of controversy over the method of disclosure. A 2006 German decision to include Article 6 of the Convention on Cybercrime and the EU Framework Decision on Attacks against Information Systems may make selling or even manufacturing vulnerabilities illegal. Most formal programs follow some form of Rain Forest Puppy's disclosure guidelines or the more recent OIS Guidelines for Security Vulnerability Reporting and Response. In general these rules forbid the public disclosure of vulnerabilities without notification to the vendor and adequate time to produce a patch.  Viruses  A zero-day virus (also known as zero- day malware or next-generation malware) is a previously unknown computer virus or other malware for which specific antivirus software signatures are not yet available. Traditionally, antivirus software relies upon signatures to identify malware. This can be very effective, but cannot defend against malware unless samples have already been obtained, signatures generated and updates distributed to users. Because of this, signature-based approaches are not effective against zero-day viruses. Most modern antivirus software still uses signatures, but also carries out other types of analysis. = Code analysis = In code analysis, the machine code of the file is analysed to see if there is anything that looks suspicious. Typically, malware has characteristic behaviour and code analysis attempts to detect if this is present in the code. Although useful, code analysis has significant limitations. It is not always easy to determine what a section of code is intended to do; particularly if it is very complex and has been deliberately written with the intention of defeating analysis. Another limitation of code analysis is the time and resources available. In the competitive world of antivirus software, there is always a balance between the effectiveness of analysis and the time delay involved. = Emulation = One approach to overcome the limitations of code analysis is for the antivirus software to run suspect sections of code in a safe sandbox and observe their behavior. This can be orders of magnitude faster than analyzing the same code, but must resist (and detect) attempts by the code to detect the sandbox. = Generic signatures = Generic signatures are signatures that are specific to certain behaviour rather than a specific item of malware. Most new malware is not totally novel, but is a variation on earlier malware, or contains code from one or more earlier examples of malware. Thus the results of previous analysis can be used against new malware. = Competitiveness in the antivirus software industry = It is generally accepted in the antivirus industry that most vendors' signature-based protection is identically effective. If a signature is available for an item of malware, then every product (unless dysfunctional) should detect it. However, some vendors are significantly faster than others at becoming aware of new viruses and/or updating their customers' signature databases to detect them. There is a wide range of effectiveness in terms of zero-day virus protection. The German computer magazine c't found that detection rates for zero-day viruses varied from 20% to 68%. It is primarily in the area of zero-day virus performance that manufacturers now compete.  U.S. government involvement  =NSA's use of zero-day exploits (2017)= In mid-April 2017 the hackers known as The Shadow Brokers (TSB)—allegedly linked to the Russian government—released files from the NSA (initially just regarded as alleged to be from the NSA, later confirmed through internal details and by American whistleblower Edward Snowden) which include a series of 'zero-day exploits' targeting Microsoft Windows software and a tool to penetrate the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT)'s service provider. Ars Technica had reported Shadow Brokers' hacking claims in mid- January 2017 and in April the Shadow Brokers posted the exploits as proof. = Vulnerabilities Equities Process = The Vulnerabilities Equities Process, first revealed publicly in 2016, is a process used by the U.S. federal government to determine on a case-by-case basis how it should treat zero-day computer security vulnerabilities; whether to disclose them to the public to help improve general computer security, or to keep them secret for offensive use against the government's adversaries. The process has been criticized for a number of deficiencies, including restriction by non-disclosure agreements, lack of risk ratings, special treatment for the NSA, and less than whole- hearted commitment to disclosure as the default option. = Signature-based detection = A virus signature is a unique pattern or code that can be used to detect and identify specific viruses. The antivirus scans file signatures and compares them to a database of known malicious codes. If they match, the file is flagged and treated as a threat. The major limitation of signature- based detection is that it is only capable of flagging already known malware, making it completely useless against zero-day attacks.

Based on the 1954 Louis L'Amour Western novel of the same name, the film is about a wanderer named Rafe Covington who swears an oath to his dying best friend to look after his beloved wife and Wyoming ranch, only to encounter other forces who strongly desire the ranch and the woman for their own purposes. Crossfire Trail premiered to 12.5 million viewers, making it the most-watched made-for-cable television movie ever, until the premiere of High School Musical 2 in 2007.  Plot  In 1880, Rafe Covington (Tom Selleck) is with his best friend Charles Rodney on a vessel bound for San Francisco. Rodney is dying, having been severely beaten by the ship's captain (Mark Acheson). With his last breaths, Rodney makes Covington swear an oath to take care of his beloved Wyoming ranch and his wife, Anne (Virginia Madsen). After beating the captain in vengeance of Rodney's death, Covington and his two other friends, Irishman Rock Mullaney (David O'Hara) and J.T. Langston (Christian Kane), head off to Wyoming. After a long trek through the Rocky Mountains, they find the ranch long deserted and immediately set to work restoring it. Covington heads into the local town to pick up supplies. He finds Anne and informs her of what happened, but she refuses to believe him as it's been accepted that Rodney was killed by a Sioux war party a year previously. Anne is being wooed by a wealthy businessman named Bruce Barkow (Mark Harmon), who essentially runs the town and secretly desires the ranch for his own purposes. Covington also makes friends with Joe Gill (Wilford Brimley), an older cowboy who was a good friend of Rodney's, but makes enemies with Barkow's men Mike (Patrick Kilpatrick) and Luke (Rex Linn) Taggart and Snake Corville (Marshall R. Teague), after Covington rescues the daughter of the Sioux chief Red Cloud (who Rodney had bought the ranch from years before) from Mike's clutches. To the ire of Barkow, Covington, Rock, J.T., and Gill round up Rodney's scattered cattle and get the ranch going again. Covington repeatedly tries to convince Anne that he was there when Rodney died and is there to look after her and the ranch, but again and again she refuses to believe him. Meanwhile, Barkow attempts to convince Anne that Covington is interested in the ranch for himself. One day, Covington, Rock, J.T., and Gill head into town for a drink, and Covington purchases a new Winchester Centennial rifle that was special ordered for Rodney. Outside, a severely drunk Mike challenges Covington to a duel. Covington tries to walk away, but when Mike draws his pistol and shoots, Covington returns fire with the rifle and kills him. Snake then attempts to ambush Covington from atop one of the buildings, but Covington notices and guns him down too. With the stakes now raised, Barkow sends for Beau Dorn (Brad Johnson), an infamous gunfighter with an impeccable reputation. The next day, Covington, Gill, Rock, and J.T. discover large volumes of petroleum oil on the ranch. When they arrive back at the ranch house, they find Barkow there with his thugs. Barkow gives Covington three days to clear out with J.T. and Rock, or else he will have Dorn force them out. He offers Gill the chance to stay, but Gill openly sides with Covington. Dorn arrives in town and meets with Barkow; he agrees to kill Covington and his friends in exchange for a piece of the ranch for himself. That night, Barkow officially proposes marriage to Anne, but she neither accepts nor rejects his proposal. When the three days run out, Barkow sends Dorn to the ranch, where he perches atop a hill with a sniper rifle. Anne also rides out to the ranch and Covington shows her the pits of petroleum oil. Finally realizing Barkow's true intentions, Anne tells Covington she believes him and they kiss. Dorn opens fire with his rifle from afar, shooting J.T. in the heart and killing him. Barkow's thugs then steal Rodney's cattle and herd them into town. When Anne rides in and tells Barkow she believes Covington, he angrily beats her and forces the town's cowardly sheriff to marry them in front of the townspeople, thereby giving him legal control over the ranch. Barkow then attempts to rape Anne in a hotel room, but he knocks her out when she fights back. After holding a funeral for J.T., Covington, Rock, and Gill load up their guns and ride into town to confront Barkow and Dorn. A furious gunfight begins where Rock, Gill, and the town's general store owner take on Barkow and his thugs. Even though Gill and the store owner are both shot and wounded, all of Barkow's men are gunned down and Rock kills Luke by emptying his rifle into him. Meanwhile, Covington engages Dorn in a tense one-on-one shootout. Dorn shoots Covington in the shoulder, but Covington plays dead and then shoots Dorn in the ankle and again in the chest when he isn't looking. Dorn slowly dies and Covington holsters his weapon, only to be shot again through the back by Barkow. Just as Barkow prepares to finish off Covington, Anne arrives and shoots him dead with Covington's rifle. With the battle over and justice restored, the townspeople emerge from the buildings and Covington, Anne, Gill, and Rock reunite as the credits roll.

Twist is sold in bags, and each bag contains a variety of pieces, mostly consisting of chocolates with some sort of filling in the center. New pieces are added and old ones discontinued frequently. Only two pieces, Lakris (licorice) and Cocos (coconut-filled chocolate), have existed since the product was launched. The name Twist refers to the way each piece is wrapped. Twist quickly became popular when it was introduced in Norway in 1957. It was introduced in the other Nordic countries soon thereafter; Sweden in 1958, Denmark in 1963, and Finland in 1964. However, the product is still most popular in its home market: Norwegians consume three times as much Twist as Swedes.

Sámi girkoráđđi, l.sa. Sáme girkoráde, s.sa. Saemien gærhkoeraerie) is the organ of the Church of Norway responsible for Sami church life. It answers to the General Synod of the Church of Norway. Background The history of the Sami people is one of marginalisation and Norwegianization – the government policy of forced assimilation of the Sami into Norwegian society. Christian missions among the Sami people go back to the Middle Ages, but from 1700 the Protestant and pietistic mission among the Sami, together with state colonialism, brought lasting changes to the Sami society (as well as religion). From around 1850 a very rough assimilation policy held the Sami people in a firm grip until 1980. This period may be referred to as the Dark Ages of the Sami people. This assimilation policy permeated the public officials, schools and the Church of Norway. In parts of Sápmi the Sami culture and language was eradicated during this period. Throughout the nineteen-eighties, an increasing awareness of the rights of the indigenous peoples became visible both in the Norwegian and the Sami society. The awakening had begun for the Sami people in the beginning of the 20th century and during the so-called Alta controversy it became a hot topic among the Norwegian politicians as well. In 1989 the Sami people were granted their own parliament, the Sámediggi. In 1992 the General Synod in the Church of Norway decided to establish an organ to oversee and work for the Sami church life. In 1997 the General Synod acknowledged its role in the assimilation process and declared it would make good of its mistakes. Organisation  The council has seven members. One member is to be a bishop appointed by the Bishops’ Conference, and one appointed by the Sami Parliament. The General Synod elects five other members, among these there is to be a representative from some of the Sami languages in Norway (Southern Sami, Lule Sami and Northern Sami). The leader of the council is elected by the General Synod. The Secretary General and the rest of the staff at the Secretariat of the council holds currently offices together with the in Oslo. A process to move the Secretariat is currently in motion. The current leader of the Sami Church Council is Tore Johnsen and the Secretary General is Rávdná Turi Henriksen (temporary constituted). Main aims of the council According to the statutes of the Sami Church Council (KM 12/92) the main aims are: * to further, protect and coordinate Sami church life in the Church of Norway * to respond to issues that according to the council is of relevance to Sami church life or indigenous people * to further knowledge of particular values that Sami church life and the heritage of Sami Christianity represents for the Church as a whole, and to work with issues the church needs to related to the Sami culture, tradition and history * to contribute to the strengthening of the culture and language of the Sami population, and to further knowledge and commitment to the role of the Sami people in the Church of Norway. * to care for relations with churches that has Sami congregations in Scandinavia and the Kola Peninsula, and to further work and coordination of issues that are of common interest of the Sami Christians * to oversee the work with indigenous question, together with the Council on Ecumenical and International Relations on behalf of the Church of Norway.

In the show, she helps Barry Allen control the speedster powers and aids in the crime-fighting as the Flash. Throughout the show, Barry and Tina appear attracted to each other, but always claim to be \\"just\\" friends and partners.

He was drawn against Northern Ireland's Daryl Gurney in the first round but lost 3-1. In 2009, Thompson reached the quarter final stage in the German Open, IDPA Lakeside Classic and the Denmark Open but his defense of the Scottish Open ended in the early stages of the competition. 2010 saw Garry reach the quarter-finals of the World Championship. He defeated Ross Montgomery, the sixth seed, in the decided set after Montgomery missed six darts to win the match. He then swept aside the previously impressive Martin McCloskey 4-1 with some much-improved finishing. In the quarter-final he took two sets off the eventual champion Martin Adams but was ultimately outplayed. Thompson was seeded 10th for the 2011 BDO World Championship, and once again reached the quarter-final stage. He beat German teenager Arno Merk 3-1 in the first round, and Alan Norris 4-2 in the second round, but in the quarter-final he lost 5-4 to Jan Dekker having led 3-0 and 4-2 in sets and missing nine darts at doubles to win the match. Had Thompson won the match and gone on to win his semi-final as well, he would have played the final on his 46th birthday. Thompson was unseeded for the 2012 BDO World Championship, and was defeated 3-1 by débutante Paul Jennings in the first round. Thompson was once again unseeded at the 2013 BDO World Championship, but this time won his first round match 3-1 over Gary Robson. In the second round, Thompson was once again defeated by Dekker in a deciding set, 4-3, having led 3-2. Thompson won the BDO British Open in 2013, arguably his biggest victory to date, beating James Wilson in the final. Despite this, Thompson only qualified for the 2014 World Championship as a preliminary and lost his prelim match to Jim Widmayer after leading 2-1 in sets and having several chances to break Widmayer's throw in the deciding set.

DART uses intelligent agents to aid decision support systems located at the U.S. Transportation and European Commands. It integrates a set of intelligent data processing agents and database management systems to give planners the ability to rapidly evaluate plans for logistical feasibility. By automating evaluation of these processes DART decreases the cost and time required to implement decisions. DART achieved logistical solutions that surprised many military planners. Introduced in 1991, DART had by 1995 offset the monetary equivalent of all funds DARPA had channeled into AI research for the previous 30 years combined. Development and introduction DARPA funded the MITRE Corporation and Carnegie Mellon University to analyze the feasibility of several intelligent planning systems. In November 1989, a demonstration named The Proud Eagle Exercise indicated many inadequacies and bottlenecks within military support systems. In July, DART was previewed to the military by BBN Systems and Technologies and the ISX Corporation (now part of Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories) in conjunction with the United States Air Force Rome Laboratory. It was proposed in November 1990, with the military immediately demanding that a prototype be developed for testing. Eight weeks later, a hasty but working prototype was introduced in 1991 to the USTRANSCOM at the beginning of Operation Desert Storm during the Gulf War. Impact Directly following its launch, DART solved several logistical nightmares, saving the military millions of dollars. Military planners were aware of the tremendous obstacles facing moving military assets from bases in Europe to prepared bases in Saudi Arabia, in preparation for Desert Storm. DART quickly proved its value by improving upon existing plans of the U.S. military. What surprised many observers was DART's ability to adapt plans rapidly in a crisis environment. DART's success led to the development of other military planning agents such as: *RDA - Resource Description and Access system *DRPI - Knowledge-Based Planning and Scheduling Initiative, a successor of DART See also * Military logistics * JADE (planning system) References Military logistics of the United States Automated planning and scheduling Common Lisp (programming language) software Mitre Corporation ","title":"Dynamic Analysis and Replanning Tool"},{"id":"16002320","text":"The following highways are numbered 355: Canada *Manitoba Provincial Road 355 *20px New Brunswick Route 355 *Prince Edward Island Route 355 *Saskatchewan Highway 355 Japan *25px Japan National Route 355 United States * 25px Interstate 355 * 25px Arkansas Highway 355 * 25px Georgia State Route 355 ** 25px Georgia State Route 355 Loop (former) * 25px Kentucky Route 355 * 25px Louisiana Highway 355 * 25px Maryland Route 355 * 25px New York State Route 355 ** New York State Route 355 (former) * 25px Ohio State Route 355 (former) * 25px Puerto Rico Highway 355 * 25px Tennessee State Route 355 * Texas: ** 25px Texas State Highway 355 (former) ** 25px Texas State Highway Loop 355 (former) ** 25px Texas Farm to Market Road 355 * 25px Virginia State Route 355 ** Virginia State Route 355 (former) ","title":"List of highways numbered 355"},{"id":"16002331","text":"George Glenn \\"Farmer\\" Bell (November 2, 1874 – December 25, 1941) was a pitcher in Major League Baseball.

Summary Killing for Culture is a look into death on film including mondo films and snuff films. It is divided into three sections, each with its own focus. =Feature film= This section deals with snuff films as seen in fictional movies. It starts with a chapter on the infamous 1976 film Snuff. Made by husband-and-wife team Michael Findlay and Roberta Findlay in 1971, it was left unreleased until 1976 when Allan Shackleton added a new ending, a scene depicting what was supposed to be the film crew for the preceding movie murdering one of the actresses. Shackleton marketed the film as authentic snuff and the film was a huge hit. The second chapter starts with an examination of Michael Powell's 1960 Peeping Tom. The film follows the exploits of a photographer, who in his spare time kills women while filming them. Considered obscene and depraved, even with its lack of nudity or blood, the film ruined Powell's otherwise good career. The next film looked at in this chapter is Joe D'Amato's 1976 film Emanuelle in America, part of the Black Emanuelle series. Emanuelle, played by Laura Gemser, is a photographer and journalist who investigates a snuff film and gets a little too close to the truth. =Mondo film= This section of the book covered mondo films, a series of exploitation \\"shockumentaries\\" that presented \\"actual\\" footage of deviant sexual activities or death. Many scenes in these films, while represented as real, were false. =Death film= This section of the book discusses actual deaths caught on film, as presented through the media. One of the main subjects of the section was the broadcast suicide of Pennsylvania State Senator R. Budd Dwyer.

The SWL was built as a result of a split initiated by Trotskyists who were part of the Israeli Committee for One Democratic Republic of Palestine. The prominent member of the SWL was Yossi Schwartz, former member of the leadership of the Canadian section of the International Communist League (Fourth Internationalist), known as the international Spartacist tendency, the Trotskyist League (Canada). The Trotskyists, led by Schwartz, believed that only a program that struggles for a socialist Palestinian republic can unite the Palestinian Arab workers and peasants of the region. With two comrades, Schwartz founded a faction named Militants for the Fourth International. The MFI contained only 5-6 comrades. After a short factional struggle, the MFI decided to build itself as independent organization. The newborn SWL contacted the Partido Obrero, the Workers' Party (Argentina) tendency in Argentina, the leading section of the Co-ordinating Committee for the Refoundation of the Fourth International. The SWL became the official section of the CCRFI. It published a monthly journal, The Militant. During 2002 and the beginning of 2003, the SWL attempted to launch a movement for one and democratic republic with Abnaa el-Balad movement. The failure to build it, led the minority faction to conclude that it must ally with the Communist Party of Israel and call for voting to its political front, Hadash. The majority, led by the PO comrades, claimed that the 2003 elections should be boycotted. As a result of the factional struggle, the SWL (Minority) changed its views and accepted the right of the Israeli people for self- determination, along the perspective of socialist federation of the Middle East with full cultural and national rights to all minorities. In June 2003, the SWL (Minority) decided to become political supporter of the International Marxist Tendency led by Alan Woods and the late Trotskyist politician Ted Grant. It changed its name to In Defense of Marxism Circle (IDMC), starting entry work within the Communist Party of Israel and later on within the Labor Party (Israel). The SWL was dissolved and does not exist any more. In July 2007, the IDMC comrades left the International Marxist Tendency following the former's demand for military support in the Hamas movement and their refusal to accept the work of the IMT within the Pakistan Peoples Party, adopting some of the politics of the SWL again but upholding the state capitalism analysis of the USSR and changing their name to the Internationalist Socialist League.

DamID identifies binding sites by expressing the proposed DNA-binding protein as a fusion protein with DNA methyltransferase. Binding of the protein of interest to DNA localizes the methyltransferase in the region of the binding site. Adenine methylation does not occur naturally in eukaryotes and therefore adenine methylation in any region can be concluded to have been caused by the fusion protein, implying the region is located near a binding site. DamID is an alternate method to ChIP-on-chip or ChIP-seq.  Description  = Principle = Principle of DamID. This sketch shows an idealized view of the DNA molecule wrapped around histones within the nucleus of a cell. The enzyme Dam (green) is fused to the protein of interest (orange) by expression of a chimeric DNA sequence. The protein of interest drags Dam onto its cognate targets. The tethering leads to methylation of GATCs in the neighborhood of the binding site (red) but not at a distance. N6-methyladenine (m6A) is the product of the addition of a methyl group (CH3) at position 6 of the adenine. This modified nucleotide is absent from the vast majority of eukaryotes, with the exception of C. elegans, but is widespread in bacterial genomes, as part of the restriction modification or DNA repair systems. In Escherichia coli, adenine methylation is catalyzed by the adenine methyltransferase Dam (DNA adenine methyltransferase), which catalyses adenine methylation exclusively in the palindromic sequence GATC. Ectopic expression of Dam in eukaryotic cells leads to methylation of adenine in GATC sequences without any other noticeable side effect. Based on this, DamID consists in fusing Dam to a protein of interest (usually a protein that interacts with DNA such as transcription factors) or a chromatin component. The protein of interest thus targets Dam to its cognate in vivo binding site, resulting in the methylation of neighboring GATCs. The presence of m6A, coinciding with the binding sites of the proteins of interest, is revealed by methyl PCR. = Methyl PCR = In this assay the genome is digested by DpnI, which cuts only methylated GATCs. Double-stranded adapters with a known sequence are then ligated to the ends generated by DpnI. Ligation products are then digested by DpnII. This enzyme cuts non-methylated GATCs, ensuring that only fragments flanked by consecutive methylated GATCs are amplified in the subsequent PCR. A PCR with primers matching the adaptors is then carried out, leading to the specific amplification of genomic fragments flanked by methylated GATCs. = Specificities of DamID versus Chromatin Immuno- Precipitation = Chromatin Immuno-Precipitation, or (ChIP), is an alternative method to assay protein binding at specific loci of the genome. Unlike ChIP, DamID does not require a specific antibody against the protein of interest. On the one hand, this allows to map proteins for which no such antibody is available. On the other hand, this makes it impossible to specifically map posttranslationally modified proteins. Another fundamental difference is that ChIP assays where the protein of interests is at a given time, whereas DamID assays where it has been. The reason is that m6A stays in the DNA after the Dam fusion protein goes away. For proteins that are either bound or unbound on their target sites this does not change the big picture. However, this can lead to strong differences in the case of proteins that slide along the DNA (e.g. RNA polymerase).  Known biases and technical issues  = Plasmid methylation bias = Depending on how the experiment is carried out, DamID can be subject to plasmid methylation biases. Because plasmids are usually amplified in E. coli where Dam is naturally expressed, they are methylated on every GATC. In transient transfection experiments, the DNA of those plasmids is recovered along with the DNA of the transfected cells, meaning that fragments of the plasmid are amplified in the methyl PCR. Every sequence of the genome that shares homology or identity with the plasmid may thus appear to be bound by the protein of interest. In particular, this is true of the open reading frame of the protein of interest, which is present in both the plasmid and the genome. In microarray experiments, this bias can be used to ensure that the proper material was hybridized. In stable cell lines or fully transgenic animals, this bias is not observed as no plasmid DNA is recovered. = Apoptosis = Apoptotic cells degrade their DNA in a characteristic nucleosome ladder pattern. This generates DNA fragments that can be ligated and amplified during the DamID procedure (van Steensel laboratory, unpublished observations). The influence of these nucleosomal fragments on the binding profile of a protein is not known. = Resolution = The resolution of DamID is a function of the availability of GATC sequences in the genome. A protein can only be mapped within two consecutive GATC sites. The median spacing between GATC fragments is 205 bp in Drosophila (FlyBase release 5), 260 in mouse (Mm9), and 460 in human (HG19). A modified protocol (DamIP), which combines immunoprecipitation of m6A with a Dam variant with less specific target site recognition, may be used to obtain higher resolution data.  Cell-type specific methods  A major advantage of DamID over ChIP seq is that profiling of protein binding sites can be assayed in a particular cell type in vivo without requiring the physical separation of a subpopulation of cells. This allows for investigation into developmental or physiological processes in animal models. = Targeted DamID = The targeted DamID (TaDa) approach uses the phenomenon of ribosome reinitiation to express Dam-fusion proteins at appropriately low levels for DamID (i.e. Dam is non-saturating, thus avoiding toxicity). This construct can be combined with cell-type specific promoters resulting in tissue-specific methylation. This approach can be used to assay transcription factor binding in a cell type of interest or alternatively, dam can be fused to Pol II subunits to determine binding of RNA polymerase and thus infer cell-specific gene expression. Targeted DamID has been demonstrated in Drosophila and mouse cells. = FRT/FLP-out DamID = Cell-specific DamID can also be achieved using recombination mediated excision of a transcriptional terminator cassette upstream of the Dam-fusion protein. The terminator cassette is flanked by FRT recombination sites which can be removed when combined with tissue specific expression of FLP recombinase. Upon removal of the cassette, the Dam-fusion is expressed at low levels under the control of a basal promoter.  Variants  As well as detection of standard protein- DNA interactions, DamID can be used to investigate other aspects of chromatin biology. = Split DamID = This method can be used to detect co-binding of two factors to the same genomic locus. The Dam methylase may be expressed in two halves which are fused to different proteins of interest. When both proteins bind to the same region of DNA, the Dam enzyme is reconstituted and is able to methylate the surrounding GATC sites. = Chromatin accessibility = Due to the high activity of the enzyme, expression of untethered Dam results in methylation of all regions of accessible chromatin. This approach can be used as an alternative to ATAC-seq or DNAse-seq. When combined with cell-type specific DamID methods, expression of untethered Dam can be used to identify cell-type specific promoter or enhancer regions. = RNA-DNA interactions = A DamID variant known as RNA-DamID can be used to detect interactions between RNA molecules and DNA. This method relies on the expression of a Dam-MCP fusion protein which is able to bind to an RNA that has been modified with MS2 stem-loops. Binding of the Dam-fusion protein to the RNA results in detectable methylation at sites of RNA binding to the genome. = Long-range regulatory interactions = DNA sequences distal to a protein binding site may be brought into physical proximity through looping of chromosomes. For example, such interactions mediate enhancer and promoter function. These interactions can be detected through the action of Dam methylation. If Dam is targeted to a specific known DNA locus, distal sites brought into proximity due to the 3D configuration of the DNA will also be methylated and can be detected as in conventional DamID. = Single cell DamID = DamID is usually performed on around 10,000 cells, (although it has been demonstrated with fewer). This means that the data obtained represents the average binding, or probability of a binding event across that cell population. A DamID protocol for single cells has also been developed and applied to human cells. Single cell approaches can highlight the heterogeneity of chromatin associations between cells.

Biography Pearce was born in Perth to Ronald Malcolm Pearce, a professional fisherman, and Betty Pearce (née Crain). He was educated at Bayswater Primary School. During a three-year stay in Tasmania he attended Hobart High School for years 8–10, returning to Western Australia and Governor Stirling Senior High School for years 11 and 12 in 1962–1963, serving as school captain in his final year. He then completed a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Western Australia (UWA), and a Diploma of Education at Claremont Teachers' College, graduating in 1969. On 19 January 1969, he married Barbara Joy Collins at St Martin's Church in Kensington. Pearce then became a secondary school teacher, teaching at Eastern Goldfields Senior High School in Kalgoorlie (1970–1972); Bentley High School (1973–1974) and Lynwood Senior High School (1975–1976), where he became Senior Master in English. Pearce was active in student politics. At UWA, he was secretary of the Guild of Students and served as vice-president on two occasions. In 1969 he became an honorary Life Associate of the UWA Guild of Students and also served as president of the National Union of Australian University Students (a predecessor to the National Union of Students) in 1969. He subsequently joined the State School Teachers' Union of Western Australia, and was elected vice- president in 1976, and whilst in Kalgoorlie and Lynwood he served as secretary of local Labor party branches, serving on the party's State Executive in 1973. Whilst in Kalgoorlie and Lynwood he served as secretary of local Labor party branches, as well as being a member of the party's State Executive in 1973.  Political career  He was preselected for the new seat of Gosnells ahead of the 1977 state election, beating Nick Clarke, a telecommunications technician, and narrowly won the seat, beating his Liberal rival by 238 votes. He was appointed Deputy Opposition Whip in 1977, and in June 1978, he was commissioned to write a report into improving Labor's prospects at the 1980 election. He recommended that the party concentrate its energies on \\"middle class\\" seats. From 1980, he served as the Shadow Minister for Education and Women's Interests. With Labor's election victory at the February 1983 election under leader Brian Burke, at which Pearce contested and won the new seat of Armadale, Pearce was promoted to the Ministry, serving as Minister for Education in the Burke ministry. On 20 December 1984 he was also given the Planning portfolio, and on 16 March 1987 the Intergovernmental Relations portfolio. From 12 May 1986 until 25 July 1986, he was also the Minister for Police and Emergency Services after Arthur Tonkin's departure from the Ministry. At this time he also became Leader of the House in the Legislative Assembly, responsible for managing government business, and held that position until his departure from the Ministry. When Peter Dowding became premier in February 1988, in a cabinet reshuffle designed to move ministers from portfolios in which they had been controversial, Pearce moved to the Transport portfolio and took on the Parliamentary and Electoral Reform portfolio, overseeing the implementation of the Acts Amendment (Electoral Reform) Act 1987 which had been steered through by former deputy premier Mal Bryce. Following the February 1989 election, at which the Environment Minister Barry Hodge lost his seat, Pearce took on the portfolio. When Carmen Lawrence became premier in February 1990, Pearce lost all roles except Environment and Leader of the House in the Legislative Assembly, but increased in seniority within the Cabinet. On 20 October 1992, it was announced by the Premier, following the delivery of Part One of the Royal Commission into WA Inc, that a finding of improper conduct had been made against Pearce and that he would stand down from the Ministry and vacate his parliamentary seat after the next election. He was accused of acting improperly in making information public about the Liberal Party president's fund withdrawals from the Teachers' Credit Society, which failed in 1987. Pearce denied the allegations, but stated that Westminster conventions meant he was required to resign anyway. On 26 October 1992, he was replaced as Environment Minister by Jim McGinty, and as Leader of the House by Eric Ripper. In 1998, he became Executive Director of the Forest Industries Federation of Western Australia and in March 2008, he became director of the National Association of Forest Industries.

The story centers on elementary schoolgirl Amu Hinamori, whose popular exterior, referred to as \\"cool and spicy\\" by her classmates, contrasts with her introverted personality. When Amu wishes for the courage to be reborn as her would-be self, she is surprised to find three colorful eggs the next morning, which hatch into three Guardian Characters: Ran, Miki, and Su. Cast of Shugo Chara! from the first anime series. Peach-Pit uses Amu to explore differences between one's true self and the self that is presented to others. Like Jun Sakurada in Peach-Pit's previous work, Rozen Maiden, Amu tackles issues such as alienation and fitting in at school. Unlike most heroines in other magical girl series, Amu is neither the perfect sweetheart nor a complete klutz. Amu gets grumpy and frequently talks back to others in contrast to the polite schoolgirls that fill the genre. Amu's Guardian Characters—Ran, Miki, Su, and later Diamond—aid her in her quest of self- discovery. Each Guardian Character represents an aspect of Amu's true self. Ran represents Amu's desire to be more honest and athletic, Miki represents Amu's desire to be more level headed and artistic, Su represents Amu's desire to be more caring and improve her domestic skills, while Diamond represents Amu's desire to shine in front of others and be a good speaker. Moreover, the Guardian Characters are more than mere mascots who help Amu learn about her true self. They can also perform a \\"Character Change\\" where Amu's personality is replaced by an entirely different one. However, Amu is not the only one with Guardian Characters. Each of the Guardians—Tadase Hotori, Nadeshiko Fujisaki, Kukai Soma, and Yaya Yuiki—have their own Guardian Characters. Amu also encounters Ikuto Tsukiyomi and Utau Hoshina(Tsukiyomi), two siblings who also have Guardian Characters and are employed by the Easter Company to search for the Embryo. Eventually, Nadeshiko Fujisaki and Kukai Soma leave the Guardians and are replaced by Rima Mashiro and Kairi Sanjo, respectively. Kairi later leaves and is replaced by Nagihiko Fujisaki, Nadeshiko's real identity. Main characters =Amu Hinamori= , the series' protagonist, is a student at Seiyo Elementary School. Amu's classmates see her as \\"cool and spicy\\". She can be identified as a tsundere (cold and mean to opening up to other people), but her true character is shy and timid. Part of the reason for this misunderstanding is the trendy punk goth clothing her mother buys for her as well as the way she expresses her shyness. However, when Amu wishes for the courage to become her would-be self, three colorful eggs appear. When they hatch, they reveal Amu's Guardian Characters: Ran, Miki, and Su. Amu becomes a member of the Guardians, the school's student council, and discovers that each member has a Guardian Character. Amu's position with the Guardians is the Joker. Her task as the Joker is to search for and purify X Eggs and X Characters (also, in the second season, she purifies Mystery Eggs, the corrupted forms of people's would-be selves). Ran, Miki, and Su help Amu with her task through a process called Character Transformation, which is enabled by the Humpty Lock and grants Amu special abilities depending on the Guardian Character. Later on, Amu also creates a fourth egg, known as Diamond. In the second season, when Amu shows her true potential, the Humpty Lock increases in power. Thus, new transformation scenes are used. Amu's main love interests are Tadase Hotori and Tsukiyomi Ikuto. Throughout the first half of the series, Amu has a crush on Tadase and blushes every time she is in his presence. She initially regarded Ikuto as a jerk and pervert, but she grew close to him as he aided her countless times. When Ikuto first confesses his love to her, she thinks he is teasing her and dismisses him. When Tadase asks Amu if it is okay for him to fall in love with her, she is thrilled at the progress in their relationship but soon finds herself drawn to Ikuto. She is saddened when Ikuto decides to leave in search of his father. Because of this, she realizes that she truly loves Ikuto. After he confesses to her and kisses her close to the lips, she refuses to admit her feelings for him, which prompts Ikuto to make a deal with her that he will get her to fall in love with him. In chapter 48, Amu confesses to Tadase's older self that she had liked him for his outer character. Although they have a much better relationship than before, Amu remains stubborn about her feelings for Ikuto. In the final chapter of Shugo Chara Encore, she is happy to reunite with him and is seen holding hands with him at Sanjou and Nikaidou's wedding. Amu's primary rival is Utau Hoshina, Ikuto's younger sister, who is jealous that Ikuto shows an interest in Amu instead of her. They soon become good friends after Utau leaves Easter. Amu gains the Dumpty Key from Yoru and uses it to unlock the Humpty Lock. In some of the later chapters, when Amu opens the Humpty Lock with the Dumpty Key, she and Tadase see more of Ikuto's past. Their journey ends when the Amu Character transforms with Diamond, and she and Ikuto fight briefly. Ran, Miki, Su, and Diamond all combine their powers, making the Amu character transform into Amulet Fortune and the Ikuto character transform into Seven Seas Treasure. Amu ventures to the Eggs' Cradle, a place where unborn and \\"lost\\" Shugo Chara reside, to search for four coloured shards representing each of her Shugo Chara in an attempt to bring Ran, Miki and Su back. In chapter 44, Diamond tells Amu that Ran, Miki and Su have \\"disappeared\\" and that she will help Amu find them as her \\"navigator\\". Diamond becomes Amu's guide in the Eggs' Cradle in Amu's search for the four coloured shards. She finally comes to terms with the loss of her Guardian Characters at the end of the journey, however as she returns she realizes that she has Ran, Miki, Su and Diamond back in Egg form much to her relief and later joy as they are born again later in Shugo Chara! Encore. She is portrayed by Yuuka Maeda in the musical. ; : Ran is the first to hatch from Amu's eggs and represents her desire to be more honest, confident and athletic. Ran is frequently cheering Amu on. During Character Change, Amu gains increased athletic abilities. During Character Transformation, Amu becomes Amulet Heart, with a cheerleader inspired outfit. In chapter 38, Ran undergoes a new Character Transformation, along with Miki, Su, and Diamond becoming Amulet Fortune. In chapter 44, she disappears along with Miki and Su, and later Diamond as well when Amu no longer needs them. In Shugo Chara! Encore at the very end of the last chapter, she and Amu's other Shugo Chara emerge and hatch again at Sanjou and Nikaidou's wedding much to Amu's joy. ; : The second Guardian Character to hatch is Miki. Miki represents Amu's desire to be sharper, level headed, and artistic. Miki also helps Amu make fashion choices. Reflecting Amu's love interests, Miki has shown an interest in Tadase's Guardian Character, Kiseki; Ikuto's Guardian Character, Yoru; Kukai's Guardian Character, Daichi; and Nagihiko's Guardian Character, Rhythm. During Character Change, Amu gains increased artistic abilities. During Character Transformation, Amu becomes Amulet Spade. In chapter 38, Miki undergoes a new Character Transformation with Ran, Su, and Diamond becoming Amulet Fortune. In Shugo Chara! Doki, Miki is the only one of Amu's Guardian Characters to be able to sense Mystery Eggs clearly. In chapter 44, she disappears along with Ran and Su, and later Diamond as well when Amu no longer needs them. In Shugo Chara Encore, she returns along with the others and together they catch the wedding bouquet for Amu who accidentally threw it back in the air again. ; : The third Guardian Character, Su, represents Amu's desire to be more caring, sensitive and improve her domestic skills. However, Su is prone to silly mistakes. She is very fond of Amu's teacher, Yuu Nikaidou. Amu cooking and cleaning skills improve during Character Change. She also becomes \\"too girly\\". During Character Transformation, Amu becomes Amulet Clover with an outfit just like Su's. In chapter 38, Su undergoes a new Character Transformation with Ran, Miki, and Diamond becoming Amulet Fortune. In chapter 44, she disappears along with Miki and Ran, and later Diamond as well when Amu no longer needs them. She and the others make an unexpected return toward the end of the last chapter of Shugo Chara Encore as they appear to be reborn again from Amu's feelings. ; : Diamond is Amu's fourth Guardian Character. Diamond represents Amu's desire to calmer and more optimistic. She is shown to be an air-headed character who always speaks with a soft voice. In Japanese versions, her name is shortened to Dia. She is a unique Guardian Character, who only appears and uses her powers when she senses Amu's strong desire to help others. Before hatching, she became an X Egg and left after Amu lost confidence in adjusting to the changes happening in the spring semester. Her egg is later found by Utau, while collecting X Eggs with Yukari. Unusually, she is not shaped like the usual X Character; she looks like a normal Guardian Character, but with a white X-shaped clip covering her black diamond-shaped clip. Because of this, Amu does not know her true name. X-Diamond is able to character change with Utau to extract more X-eggs from people. They can also Character Transform with Utau, becoming Dark Jewel, however, the transformation does not last very long. When Amu is finally able to prove to Diamond that she does have enough confidence to shine she reverts into her true original form. Together they undergo a Character Transformation, becoming Amulet Diamond. Afterward, Diamond returns to her egg until Amu's desires to \\"shine again\\", but secretly comes out as a spirit at times. In chapter 38, Diamond finally returns and helps Amu to lift Ikuto's spirit. They then character transform and help Ikuto, She, Ran, Miki, and Su combine powers with Amu becoming Amulet Fortune. In chapter 44, Diamond tells Amu that Ran, Miki and Su have \\"disappeared\\" and that she will help Amu find them as her \\"navigator\\". Diamond becomes Amu's guide in the Eggs' Cradle in Amu's search for the four colored shards. Coming to terms with herself and the future, Amu accepts the loss of her Guardian Characters and Diamond disappears as well, guaranteeing that the four of them will always be watching over her. In Shugo Chara! Encore, Diamond and the other three have hatched again and catch Amu's thrown bouquet. When Amu Character Changes with Diamond in Shugo Chara! Party's Shugo Chara Dokki Doki, Amu does not really do much but smile and sparkle, disappointing Ran, Miki, and Su. =Tadase Hotori= is a boy in the same year as Amu and serves as King's Chair of the Guardians. Like Amu, he is actually a shy person and is not good at public speaking; instead, he Character Changes with his Guardian Character, Kiseki. Although he is popular with the girls, when a girl confesses their love to Tadase, he will have Kiseki reject her. However, whenever he hears the word ouji (\\"prince\\"), or anything resembling the word ouji, he Character Changes into an egotistical king who seeks world domination. Amu develops a crush on Tadase soon after she transfers to the school. His love interest is Amulet Heart, Amu's Character Transformation with Ran, but it later becomes Amu herself. In episode 39, Kiseki's egg turns into an X Egg because Tadase lost his self-esteem by not being able to find the Embryo. With the help of Amulet Heart, Tadase turns back to normal. Tadase has known Ikuto and Utau since childhood, but he does not talk about it in detail until the Guardians are about to face Utau in their final battle. Amu and Tadase reconcile soon after, though. Later on, he agrees to help Amu save Ikuto from Easter. Tadase confesses his love for Amu in chapter 28 (episode 74 in the anime) behind Amu's house while Ikuto is hiding in Amu's closet. Ikuto overhears and makes fun of Tadase, only to protect him, which he knows nothing about. When Tadase is facing Ikuto in chapter 35, his staff becomes a sword called Royal Sword in episode 99. Tadase ventures into the Eggs' Cradle with Amu, but subsequently gets separated from her because of a meteor shower. The future Tadase, who looks like Tsukasa, helps Amu and reveals himself to be Tadase. In episode 127 of the anime, he kisses Amu on the cheek and tells her that he will always be by her side. He is portrayed by Hidemi Hikita in the musical. ; : Kiseki is Tadase's Guardian Character. Kiseki was born for a combination of Tadase's desire to be stronger and the dream of world domination. Because of this, Kiseki is extremely egotistical and often demanding, and does not like obeying others. He frequently calls other Guardian Characters to go on \\"Special Secret Meetings\\". A running gag is that the other Guardian Character will almost always ignore him when he starts up a meeting. Kiseki is aware of Tadase's crush on Amu and acts the same way as Amu's Guardian Characters whenever Tadase seems to be confessing to Amu. Kiseki holds a grudge against Ikuto's Guardian Character, Yoru. During Character Change, Tadase gains the confidence to overcome his shyness. However, sometimes Tadase will become an egotistical person who seeks world domination. Although Tadase could not Character Transform with Kiseki at first, they later gain this ability with the help of Amu after Kiseki's egg gets tainted with an X, becoming Platinum Royal. = Ikuto Tsukiyomi = is a teenage boy in high school, contracted by Easter to find the Embryo. He often helps Amu even though he works for Easter. Ikuto actually despises Easter and tries to wrench himself free from them by trying to find the Embryo to grant that wish. He possesses the Dumpty Key which pairs with Amu's Humpty Lock which at first did not fit in the keyhole. Like his father, Ikuto is a skilled violinist. He is the current owner of the Dumpty Key, which originally belonged to Aruto, his father, although Tadase's father had it for a little while. His father is presumed to be dead, but Ikuto refuses to believe it and has set out to find him. As her status as the only daughter of the past president of the Easter Company, his mother was forced to marry the company's director after her husband's violin was found in a foreign country. From her second marriage, she bound her children to working for Easter. Ikuto's personality is aloof, mysterious, and a little naughty. He likes teasing people, especially Amu and Tadase. He is also the older brother of Utau Hoshina. As the series goes on, he grows very strong feelings for Amu—he confessed that he loves her in the same chapter Tadase does, although she believes he is teasing her. He later surrenders himself to Easter, not wanting to get anyone else involved in the mess he made. In the manga timeline, it is shown he character transforms with a new black Guardian Egg to become Death Rebel, shocking Amu. In chapter 38, he character transforms with Yoru and the black egg into Seven Seas Treasure. In chapter 39; it is said that Ikuto may have two eggs, one is possibly still inside him. In one of the later chapters, Ikuto calls Amu \\"princess\\" and she replies by asking him to thank her for making him get back to normal. Ikuto swears that this time he will be the one to protect her. In chapter 43, Ikuto confesses to Amu he will never see her again as he is going to search for his father. Ikuto returns for Yukari Sanjo and Yuu Nikaidou's wedding. Amu is very happy and relieved to see him. He promises that he will show Amu sides of him that she has not seen, but only when he returns for her when she is older. Later he kisses her on the nose. At the wedding Ikuto and Amu are seen holding hands and Amu says she knows she can reach the future without letting go of his hand. He is portrayed by KENN in the musical. ; : Yoru is Ikuto's cat-like Guardian Character and represents Ikuto's desire to be free. Yoru often goes out by himself and enjoys causing trouble for the Guardians and their Guardian Characters for fun. When Ikuto and Yoru undergo a Character Transformation, they become Black Lynx. Yoru becomes hysterical when Ikuto does the Death Rebel Character Transformation in chapter 31. During this time, he also cannot track Ikuto because the hypnotizing tuning fork confuses him. Later on, when Amu and Tadase find Ikuto being controlled by Easter, Yoru takes the Dumpty Key and gives it to Amu. In chapter 38 he and the black egg combine powers with Ikuto to become Seven Seas Treasure. In chapter 46, Amu finds a dazed Yoru in the Eggs' Cradle. He and Amu fall out of the Egg's cradle and see Ikuto. In chapter 48, when Yoru sees how happy Ikuto is, he commends him for having become a \\"true alley cat\\", and goes back to being a heart's egg inside of Ikuto. =Utau Hoshina/Tsukiyomi= is a junior high student model turned singing idol. She is actually Ikuto's younger sister, . Utau had tried to find the Embryo to release her brother from Easter, but she never succeeded. Utau is very attracted to Ikuto and becomes extremely jealous of Amu because Ikuto shows an interest in her. However, she eventually accepts Amu and they become friends. She becomes good friends with Kukai in the anime and manga, and soon starts a relationship with him. She was the vocalist of the indie band Black Diamond which is produced by her manager, Yukari Sanjo. They the CDs of their music to draw the eggs out of children and make them into X Eggs. She only sings in Black Diamond whilst in a x-chara change with X-Diamond. X-Diamond is found during one of her x-egg withdrawal sessions. Utau mainly uses X-Diamond to extract other people's heart's egg since X-Diamond can withdraw more x-eggs than Il can; El refuses to do anything. X-Diamond can Character Transform with Utau, and become Dark Jewel, however, the transformation lasts for only a short period of time. When the plan falls apart, Utau quit Easter with her manager and becomes a singer on her own, without Easter contracting her. She is portrayed by Misaki Yonemura in the musical. ; : The devilish Iru is the first of Utau's two Character Guardians introduced in the story. Iru seems mean and unkind, but it is just her character. Sometimes she can be helpful and sincere, but she dislikes nagging. She represents Utau's energetic and playful side. During Character Transformation, Utau becomes Lunatic Charm, with the attack Nightmare Lorelei and later, Lilin Trident. When Iru feels lonely because Eru is not there for her to tease, and when she feels that Utau is ignoring her because of Diamond, she Character Transforms with Amu, becoming Amulet Devil. ; : El is Utau's second Guardian Character and is the complete angelic opposite of Il. She represents Utau's caring and outspoken side towards her brother Ikuto. El often nags, likes correcting people over their choices that she considers wrong herself, and helps those who are troubled by love. Because El was treated badly by Il and ignored by Utau, she left home and wound up in Amu's care. El can perform a Character Transformation with Amu, resulting in Amulet Angel, which surprises Utau. However, as Amu is not El's real owner, the Character Transformation remains powerless with no real abilities. Whenever El performs a Character Transformation with Amu, Amu usually ends up being embarrassed because of El's over-the-top antics. Eru finally performed a Character Transformation with Utau, forming Seraphic Charm. Later in the manga series, Utau uses White Wing to help the Guardians help Ikuto.

When Amu rejects the offer to join the Guardians, Nadeshiko tries several tactics to convince her to join. The two become best friends and Nadeshiko looks over and supports Amu in her love life. However, before Amu and Nadeshiko enter the sixth grade, Nadeshiko leaves Seiyo Elementary to travel to Europe to study dancing. : Nadeshiko is actually a boy named Nagihiko Fujisaki. Amu and the girls call him by his nickname \\"Nagi\\". It is tradition in the Fujisaki family for males to be raised as females as part of their training so that they may play female roles in Japanese dance. Nagihiko's secret is known to his family, Tadase, Kukai, Rima (including their Shugo Chara), and the school's principal Tsukasa Amakawa. Nagihiko has trouble telling Amu that he is actually a boy, instead, he tells Amu that he is Nadeshiko's twin brother. After Kairi leaves the Guardians, Nagihiko returns and is appointed as the interim Jack's Chair. She/he is portrayed by Kanon Fukuda in the musical. :; :: Temari is Nagihiko's first Guardian Character. Temari appears to be elegant and reflects Nagihiko's desire to be more mannered and become a Japanese dancer. However, during Character Change, both Temari and Nagihiko (as Nadeshiko) become aggressive and very masculine; Nagihiko, inadvertently, also gains a naginata, which he promptly uses. Prior to Nagihiko's return to the guardians, Temari went back into her egg to slumber. In chapter 34 and episode 98, Temari wakes up after Nagihiko realizes that it does not matter what gender a person is, it is the effort they put into whatever they do. They perform a Character Transformation, Yamato Maihime's attack is \\"Robe of Feathers, Dance of the Cherry Blossoms\\". :; :: Rhythm is Nagihiko's second Guardian Character. Rhythm appears to be cool and outgoing, showing Nagihiko's boyish self. However, he can also be quite a flirt, as is shown when he hugs all of the female guardian charas after just meeting them. Rhythm's egg was first seen in chapter 30 and in episode 56, but as of chapter 34 and episode 91, he hatches after Nagihiko remembers how much he likes playing basketball, at his own pace and rhythm, while fighting against an X Character. During Character Change, huge headphones appear around Nagihiko's neck, and he gains an energetic persona; he also does not seem to hesitate to participate in athletic activities, and goes all out dominating several sports such as soccer, baseball, tennis, and judo.

She is also a ballerina, though a rather clumsy one. She has a newborn baby brother named Tsubasa, who she claims gets all her parents' attention. It is because of this that her baby-like Guardian Character, Pepe, was born. Though she acts jealously around Tsubasa, Yaya does have a responsible side.

She is portrayed by Meimi Tamura in the musical. :; :: Pepe is a baby-like Guardian Character who was born from Yaya's desire to remain baby-like in nature.

Although Rima is the same age as Amu, she is petite and has relatively poor athletic abilities. Most of the boys in her class love her and treat her like a real queen because of her beauty and passive personality, while the girls are annoyed by her because of her selfishness. : Because of a kidnapping incident that happened before she transferred to Seiyo Elementary, her parents pick her up after school. Since it interferes with their work schedules, they often argue about who cares more for Rima over their work. This results in Rima often having no one but Kusukusu as company for her secret interest in gag comedy. Later, she opens up to Amu and becomes friends with her. : When Yaya explains to Rima about Amu and Nadeshiko's friendship, she appears to be jealous. At first, she is shown to have a great dislike for Nagihiko because Amu told Rima and Yaya that he is Nadeshiko's twin brother due to a confusion between the two. This leads Rima to be protective over Amu and cold toward Nagihiko, although it is implied she is in love with him. She tells Nagihiko that he is useless because his Guardian Character is still inside an egg, but she gains respect and trust for him later on.

However, when he sees the true meaning of his \\"missions\\", he tries to rebel against Yukari, but not before he reveals his secret to the Guardians when they accidentally discover him with teaser CDs.

However, he overreacts at the slightest provocation when Amu has a relationship with a boy. ; : Ami Hinamori is Amu's little sister who is innocent and pure-hearted. Ami is able to see Guardian Characters despite the fact that she does not have one. Unlike Amu, Ami is dressed in \\"Sweet Lolita\\" clothing. She respects and looks up to both Utau and Amu and loves to sing. She is a huge fan of Utau and plays a big role in helping her rediscover her good side. ; : Tsukasa Amakawa is the first King's Chair of the Guardians and their founder. He is the Seiyo Elementary superintendent and manages the planetarium as a part-time job. He is the author of the book Kokoro no Tamago (The Heart's Egg'). Tsukasa looks like Tadase because he is Tadase's uncle on his mother's side. In chapter 32, Tsukasa is seen in a photograph along with the Hotori family and the Tsukiyomi family. So when Ikuto runs away, Tsukasa takes him in and apparently \\"kidnapped\\" him in Tadase's eyes. At first, he is thought to hold the Humpty Lock. He is a cat lover and has a liking for Ikuto's cat ears, often teasing him with catnip and food. In chapter 37, Tsukasa mysteriously tells Ikuto \\"he is not a grown up man\\". Tsukasa also has a cunning ability to guess people's thoughts. ; : Kazuomi Hoshina is the managing director of Easter company, a middle-aged man who is also Ikuto and Utau's stepfather, and the former superior of Nikaidou and Yukari. After his repeated failure to obtain the Embryo, he starts fearing that Gozen may abandon him, so he forms a plan to brainwash Ikuto to collect X Eggs. In chapter 33, he realizes that the Embryo only shows up when X Eggs are purified, so he lures the Guardians into a trap. In chapter 41, it is revealed that Kazuomi is actually Hikaru's grandfather and he had previously lost his son and wife in a terrible accident. It is also revealed that he forced Souko, Ikuto and Utau's mother, into remarrying him so that his grandson can be his successor at the Easter Company instead of Ikuto. In chapter 42, he asks Ikuto and Souko for forgiveness and decides to retire from Easter. When he gives the divorce papers to Souko, Souko gives him a paper which, after reading it, shocks him. It is later revealed during a conversation between Ikuto and Souko that she never submitted the divorce papers from Aruto, Ikuto's real father in the first place. Ikuto refers to him as \\"Mr. Director\\". ; : Nobuko Saeki is a spiritual fortune teller and has a praised fortune telling column in Housewives' Knowledge, although she dislikes the occult. She is 54 and likes miso peanuts. Her spiritual sense is so strong that she is able to see the Guardian Characters. She is the one who inspires Amu to wish to be a new person. In Chapter 33, she appears to help the Guardians into the Easter headquarters, saying that Amu is searching for someone precious to her. She is also fond of Tadase, probably because he looks so much like Tsukasa, who is one of the astrologers in her magazine. ; : Saaya Yamabuki is an egotistical girl in the same class as Amu and leader of the Tadase Fan Club. Along with the other club members, Saaya shows off whenever she gets the chance to impress Tadase, and Kukai, but to no avail. She is also very jealous of Amu. Because of that, she once transformed with her hearts' egg (which changed into a ? egg) in Doki! into Hinamori Dream. ; : Seiichiro Suzuki is a third grade boy who greatly admires Amu. He is often seen cheering for Amu, admiring her in some way, or proving to Saaya Yamabuki that Amu is a superhero or can save anyone from anything. References Shugo Chara!

Thomas on a tract of prairie land. It was later named after Thomas' son-in-law, Grant Foreman, by the Muskogee Historical Society and the National Register of Historic Places. Grant Foreman and his wife, Carolyn Thomas Foreman, each became notable historians who wrote a number of books and articles about Oklahoma history. On display are many of their possessions, including books and memorabilia, photos, documents and Native American works of art. When Judge Thomas moved to Muskogee after being appointed to a newly created judgeship in 1897, he had difficulty finding a suitable property for the home he wished to build. He and his daughter, Carolyn, moved into the Adams House hotel until Thomas could get a house ready. He talked to Pleasant Porter, then the Principal Chief of the Creek Nation, who agreed to sell him a by another large vacant tract piece of the Porter Pasture, just outside the city. The Thomases moved in in 1898.\\"Thomas-Foreman Historic Home.\\" 2012 Accessed February 13, 2019. Reportedly, there was only one small log cabin in the vicinity and no vegetation except grass. The judge planted 350 trees which provided fruit and shade. A large red oak tree in the northwest corner of the property is the only one of these original trees still standing. Carolyn and Grant collected a number of acorns while honeymooning in California in 1905. These apparently survived until the present. Three Rivers Museum The Grant-Foreman House is operated by the Three Rivers Museum. The Three Rivers Museum was established in Muskogee in 1989 as the dream of local historian Dorothy Ball, chairman at that time of the Muskogee Historic Preservation Commission. The main building of the museum, the formerly-abandoned Midland Valley Railroad Depot, was obtained in 1998 with federal grant funds. Due to budget issues regarding maintenance and public access with respect to the Grant Foreman House owned by the Oklahoma Historical Society, the Museum voted in 2002 to contract with OHS to take over the operation of that site and make needed renovations.

A member of the Democratic Party, she was the first woman elected as mayor and the youngest, winning after three recounts by the narrowest margin recorded. With private sector experience, she had been elected previously to the Town Council. Early life Capone was born, raised and educated in East Haven, Connecticut. She attended local schools and received her MBA from Southern Connecticut State University. She married in 1999 to Regan Almon and divorced in 2011. Career She entered local politics and was elected to the 15-member Town Council of East Haven as its only Democrat. In 2010 Democratic registered voters outnumbered registered Republicans, but another major portion of the electorate is independent. In 2007, Capone challenged the 10-year Republican incumbent mayor, Joseph A. Maturo, Jr., and ran a campaign based on change. She claimed her private sector experience in budget and fiscal management could help her improve city government. She promoted upgrading the city's use of technology, and developing Candlestick Park for the city. After three recounts, Capone won by 25 votes, the closest election in the town's history. She was the first woman elected mayor of East Haven, and the youngest at age 32.Mark Zaretsky, \\"East Haven mayor slapped with ethics complaint\\", New Haven Register, 11 October 2009, accessed 27 November 2014Mark Zaretsky, \\"Capone sworn in, makes history in E.

Illingworth filed an ethics complaint against Almon for her having substantially raised the salary of her assistant Berg in 2008, suggesting they may have an improper personal relationship. Supporters of Capone Almon suggested his action was to try to discredit the mayor prior to the election, scheduled for early November, and questioned why Illingworth had not challenged the raise when it took place in 2008. \\"Capone confirmed that Berg got a $9,960 raise, effective July 1, 2008, increasing her salary from just over $40,000 to $50,000. But she said Berg's job was reclassified at the same time, with the added duties of writing grants and scheduling special events -- and since then, Berg's efforts have brought in $742,156 in grant revenue.\\" In 2008, twenty other positions had received raises, which were also criticized in 2009 by Capone Almon's Republican challenger in the November election. Capone Almon was re-elected. Under her administration, the city has increased the amount of money it has gained in grants for improvements. In 2009 the United States Department of Justice began an investigation into actions by the police department, about which many complaints of harassment of Latinos had been received. It issued a preliminary report on the conduct of the East Haven police department under Police Chief Leonard Gallo, who had served since his 1998 appointment by former mayor Joseph Maturo, Jr. DOJ was conducting both a civil and criminal investigation into the conduct of the department following a 2009 \\"unwarranted arrest of a Catholic priest who was looking into charges that his Latino parishioners were victims of police discrimination.\\"\\"East Haven Mayor Must Go/ Joe Maturo Jr. Must Follow Police Chief He Backed To The Hilt\\", Hartford Courant, 30 January 2012, accessed 27 November 2014 Capone Almon put Gallo on administrative leave after receiving the report, pending final actions. 2011 General Election In the November 2011 General Election, Capone as incumbent was challenged by Republican Joseph Maturo, Jr., the former mayor. He narrowly defeated her by 31 votes. This slim margin forced an automatic recount, as had occurred in the 2007 election, but he maintained his victory. He immediately reinstated Gallo, who barred police commission members from police headquarters and the parking lot. They soon passed a policy that required him to allow them access.Dave Altimari, Denise Buffa, and David Owens, \\"FBI: 4 Arrested Police Officers Were 'Bullies With Badges',\\" The Hartford Courant, 25 January 2012 In December 2011 the Justice Department delivered its final report of the civil investigation into the police department, concluding that it had a pattern of \\"systematically discriminating against Latinos.\\" It also found that the department had repeatedly changed reports of the arrests of Almon and Father Paul Manship, trying to cover up evidence in these cases. As of January 2012, the Justice Department criminal investigation resulted in the arrests of four officers for harassing Latinos, and authorities said that Gallo had interfered with the investigation, as if he \\"didn't understand civilian control of the police department.\\" After the arrests, Gallo resigned as police chief in late January 2012. In 2012 two officers pleaded guilty; the other two were convicted at trial in 2013. In 2014 all received sentences,with sentences ranging up to 5 years in federal prison.

Indonesia has the second largest ethnic Malay population after Malaysia. Indonesian, the national language of Indonesia, is a standardized form of Riau-Johor Malay.Sneddon 2003, The Indonesian Language: Its History and Role in Modern Society, p. 69–70Kamus Saku Bahasa Indonesia, p. 272, PT Mizan Publika, There were a number of Malay kingdoms in Indonesia that covered the islands of Sumatra and Kalimantan, such as Srivijaya, Melayu Kingdom, Dharmasraya, Sultanate of Deli, Sultanate of Siak Sri Indrapura, Riau-Lingga Sultanate, Sultanate of Bulungan, Pontianak Sultanate, and the Sultanate of Sambas. History =Sumatra= There have been various Malay kingdoms based on the island of Sumatra: the Melayu Kingdom, Srivijaya, Dharmasraya Sultanate of Deli, Sultanate of Siak Sri Indrapura and the Riau-Lingga Sultanate . =Kalimantan= In the Pontianak incidents during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, the Japanese massacred most of the Malay elite and beheaded all of the Malay Sultans in Kalimantan. During the Fall of Suharto, there was a resurgence in Malay nationalism and identity in Kalimantan and ethnic Malays and Dayaks in Sambas massacred Madurese during the Sambas riots. Language A Palembangese Malay girl clad in the Gending Sriwijaya costume Sumatra is the homeland of the Malay languages, which today spans all corners of Insular Southeast Asia. The Indonesian language, which is the country's official language and lingua franca, was based on Riau-Lingga (or Johor-Riau) Malay. The Malay language has a long history, which has a literary record as far back as the 7th century AD. A famous early Malay inscription, the Kedukan Bukit Inscription, was discovered by the Dutchman M. Batenburg on 29 November 1920, at Kedukan Bukit, South Sumatra, on the banks of the River Tatang, a tributary of the River Musi. It is a small stone of 45 by 80 cm. It is written in Old Malay, a possible ancestor of today's Malay language and its variants. Most Malay languages and dialects spoken in Indonesia are mutually unintelligible with Standard Indonesian. The most widely spoken are Palembang Malay (3.2 million), Jambi Malay (1 million), Bengkulu Malay (1.6 million) and Banjarese (4 million) (although not considered to be a dialect of Malay by its speakers; its minor dialect is typically called Bukit Malay). Besides the proper Malay languages, there are several languages closely related to Malay such as Minangkabau, Kerinci, Kubu and others. These languages are closely related to Malay, but their speakers do not consider their languages to be Malay. There are many Malay-based creoles spoken in the country especially in eastern Indonesia due to contacts from the western part of Indonesia and during colonial rule where Malay replaced Dutch as a lingua franca. The most well-known Malay creoles in Indonesia are Ambonese Malay, Betawi, Manado Malay and Papuan Malay. Sub-ethnic groups of Indonesian Malays =Malay ethnic groups in Indonesia= A Palembangese Malay woman in the traditional wedding costume from South Sumatera, Indonesia, known as Aesan Gede The Malay people in Indonesia fall into various sub-ethnicities with each having its own distinct linguistic variety, history, clothing, traditions, and a sense of common identity.

It is located at 330 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, known as Mickle St. during Whitman's time there. History In 1873, Whitman suffered a paralytic stroke and, in May the same year, his mother Louisa Whitman died; both events left him depressed.Miller, 33 Louisa was in Camden, New Jersey at the time and Whitman arrived three days before her death. He returned to Washington, D. C., where he had been living, only brieflyKaplan, 347 before returning to Camden to live with his brother George, paying room and board. The brothers lived on Stevens Street and Walt lived there for the next eleven years.Moss, 50 Whitman spent the Christmas of 1883 with friends in Germantown, Pennsylvania while his brother was building a farmhouse in Burlington, New Jersey that included accommodations for the poet.Loving, 428 Instead of moving with his brother, however, Whitman purchased the Mickle Street House in Camden in the spring of 1884. He was 65, and it was the first home he owned.Kaplan, 11 Whitman called it his \\"shanty\\" or \\"coop\\", emphasizing its shabbiness.Reynolds, 551 His brother George did not approve of the purchase and the decision strained their relationship.Kaplan, 13 Others questioned Whitman's judgment as well. A friend called it \\"the worst house and the worst situated\\".Reynolds, 550 Another friend noted it \\"was the last place one would expect a poet to select for a home.\\" The lot on which the home was standing was purchased in 1847 by a clerk named Adam Hare for $350. It was likely Hare who built the house. By the time Whitman bought it, it was a two-story row house with six rooms and no furnace. Its recent occupant was Alfred Lay, the grandfather of a young friend of Whitman. When Lay couldn't pay the rent for March, Whitman loaned him the $16 he needed. Whitman soon after purchased the home for $1,750, which he earned from recent sales of a recent edition of Leaves of Grass and through a loan from publisher George William Childs.Kaplan, 13–14 Lay continued to live there with his wife, cooking to cover part of their rent and paying $2 a week; the Lays moved out on January 20, 1885.Loving, 432 Whitman later invited Mary Davis, a sailor's widow living a few blocks away, to serve as his housekeeper in exchange for free rent in the house.Kaplan, 14 She moved in on February 24, 1885,Loving, 433 bringing with her a cat, a dog, two turtledoves, a canary, and other assorted animals.Reynolds, 548 During a yearlong tour of the United States in 1882, Oscar Wilde visited Whitman at this home. The two writers shared elderberry wine and Wilde later reflected, \\"There is no one in this great wide world of America home I love and honor so much\\".Schmidt, Shannon McKenna and Joni Rendon. Novel Destinations: Literary Landmarks from Jane Austen's Bath to Ernest Heminway's Key West. Washington, D.C.: National Geographic, 2008: 47. Another international visitor, an admirer named John Johnston, described meeting Whitman on a hot summer day in 1890, sitting cross-legged on a large rocking chair with his shirt open and sleeves rolled up above his elbows.Reynolds, 582 While living in the home, Whitman completed several poems, many focused on public events. One was a sonnet published in the February 22, 1885, issue of the Philadelphia Press called \\"Ah, Not This Granite Dead and Cold\\" which commemorated the completion of the Washington Monument. Some of Whitman's writing was done in his bedroom, which visitors noted was similar to a newspaper office, piled with stacks of paper.Kaplan, 16 In this home, he also prepared an anthology of essays and articles November Boughs. During his years in the house, however, Whitman only earned an estimated $1,300, of which only $20 came from royalties from Leaves of Grass and about $350 came from new works. The majority of his earnings were donations from admirers and well-wishers. Walt Whitman in his Mickle Street home the year before his death Whitman's health had been failing since before he moved into the home, worsened by another stroke he suffered in 1888, and he began making preparations for his death. For $4,000, he commissioned a granite house-shaped mausoleumLoving, 479 which he visited often during its construction.Kaplan, 49 In the last week of his life, too weak to lift a knife or fork, he wrote: \\"I suffer all the time: I have no relief, no escape: it is monotony — monotony — monotony — in pain.\\"Reynolds, 587 He spent his last years preparing a final edition of Leaves of Grass. At the end of 1891, he wrote to a friend: \\"L. of G. at last complete—after 33 y'rs of hackling at it, all times & moods of my life, fair weather & foul, all parts of the land, and peace & war, young & old\\".Reynolds, 586 In January 1892, an announcement was published in the New York Herald in which Whitman asked that \\"this new 1892 edition... absolutely supersede all previous ones. Faulty as it is, he decides it as by far his special and entire self-chosen poetic utterance.\\"Kaplan, 51 The final edition of Leaves of Grass was published in 1892 and is referred to as the \\"deathbed edition\\".Miller, 36 Whitman died at 6:43 p.m. on March 26, 1892, a few days before his 73rd birthday. His autopsy was performed at the home and revealed that the left lung had collapsed and the right was at one- eighth its breathing capacity. A public viewing of Whitman's body was also held at the Camden home; over one thousand people visited in three hours.Loving, 480 In his final years, Whitman had noted his appreciation for the house and for Camden. He wrote, \\"Camden was originally an accident—but I shall never be sorry. I was left over in Camden. It has brought me blessed returns.\\" Modern history Walt Whitman's house, 2007 After Whitman's death, the majority of the home's contents remained at the house. His heirs sold it to the city of Camden in 1921 and it was opened to the public five years later. In 1947, ownership was passed to the state of New Jersey. The home was listed in the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection's Historic Preservation Office in 1971 (ID# 934)New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection - Historic Preservation Office New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places - Camden County list (PDF) and the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1966 (NR reference #: 66000461).National Register of Historic Places - NEW JERSEY - Camden County NRHP county listing The surrounding area was designated in 1970 as the Walt Whitman Neighborhood (ID# 935) within the state, and the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 (NR reference #: 78001752). The six-room Walt Whitman House is operated as a museum by the New Jersey Division of Parks and Forestry. The home is now open to the public. It is operated with help from the Walt Whitman Association. Included in the collection is the bed in which the poet died and the death notice that was taped to his front door.

He has illustrated several books for many authors including Julie Andrews Edwards, Lester Laminack, Erica Perl, Margie Palatini, Alyssa Capucilli, Harvey Fierstein, and Pamela Duncan Edwards. Background Henry Cole, born 1955 near Purcellville, Virginia, United States, most often uses a cartoon-like style with vivid colors and primarily works in acrylics and colored pencils. Cole grew up on a dairy farm in Virginia. He enjoyed art as a child and frequently made birthday cards for friends or signs for school functions He later went on to study Forestry at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. He never received formal art training, but his mother was an illustrator who gave him advice throughout his career. Work Before Cole was an illustrator, he taught science at The Langley School in Virginia from 1984–1999.(2008). Cole, Henry. Something About the Author, 181, 41-45. He frequently used art to illustrate a concept during his classes. As an elementary school teacher, Cole often had the opportunity to hear visiting authors and illustrators speak, and thought that he might be interested in pursuing book illustration as a career. Cole has collaborated with many authors as well as celebrities such as Julie Andrews and Harvey Fierstein. The Sissy Duckling (2002), written by Fierstein, was a Lambada Literary Award Finalist in 2002 Some of Cole's most famous works are Moosestache (1999) written by Margie Palatini, Mooseletoe (2000) written by Margie Palatini, Big Chickens (2008) written by Leslie Helakoski, and Honk! The Story of a Prima Swanerina (2000) written by Pamela Duncan Edwards, which has recently been made into an animated video by Disney. Some criticism has been received for And Tango Makes Three (2005), for which Cole was the illustrator. The book is about the true story of two male penguins that raised a chick together in the Central Park Zoo in New York City. Afraid that the book promotes homosexuality, many schools have categorized this book as nonfiction rather than juvenile fiction. The Library of Congress, however, continues to categorize this work as juvenile fiction. Cole's illustrations for this work and several others have been recognized for their realistic nature which is in contrast to his usual trend of cartoon-like illustrations. In a review of And Tango Makes Three, Booklist contributor Jennifer Mattson states that \\"Cole's pictures complement the perfectly cadenced text\\".Mattson, Jennifer (2005). And Tango Makes Three (book). Booklist. 101(18). Retrieved April 24, 2009, from Professional Development Collection database. Cole's many books are well reviewed. Booklists review of Katy Duck is a Caterpillar (2009), written by Alyssa Satin Capucilli states that, \\"The...comedic color drawings translate Katy's longing and disappointment and will easily appeal to young children\\".BooklistOnline Cole has also received praise for his illustrations in Tubby the Tuba (2006), written by Paul Tripp. Children's book reviewer Carolyn Phelan for Booklist states, \\"Cole's colorful retro-style artwork endows the instrument-characters great emotional expressiveness. He uses the large format to good advantage, creating scenes that are varied in their effects and show up well from a distance\\". Cole's usual whimsical, cartoon- like style with vivid colors and limited white space not only helps to enhance the story by adding character elements; it also draws young readers in. In addition to illustrating for other writers, Cole has also written and authored fifteen children's books. I Took a Walk (1998) and On the Way to the Beach (2003) both depict things one might find while walking through nature. A Kirkus Reviews contributor wrote that On the Way to the Beach had \\"marvelously detailed and accurate illustrations [that] give readers a peek into the natural world\\". In an additional review for On the Way to the Beach Carolyn Phelan for Booklist states that, \\"Parents looking for an early introduction to nature study will find this an informative offering with a playful approach\\". On Meadowview Street (2007) is about a girl named Caroline who decides to stop mowing her lawn and let it grow into a field of wildflowers. A Publisher's Weekly critic described the illustrations as \\"beautifully portrayed in meticulously detailed, velvety acrylics\\". Jennifer Mattson from Booklist stated, \\"The jab at soulless suburbia and its faux-bucolic trappings may be most appreciated by adults, but the crucial message ... will speak strongly to today’s ecologically aware children. And it's all done without stridency\\". All of the books end with a spread containing panels of wildlife seen in the book. Released in early 2010, A Nest for Celeste is Cole's latest foray into writing, and was received with great acclaim. About a mouse looking for a place she can call home, the book also teaches about the work of naturalist John James Audubon as Celeste makes friends with his young apprentice. Amazon.com featured it as a Best Book of the Month in March and the Publisher's Weekly starred review stated that \\"Evocative illustrations, compelling characters, and thoughtful reflections on the nature of home combine to powerful effect.\\" One notable title, \\"Unspoken,\\" (2012) has received numerous awards:: NY Times Best Picture Books, ALA Notable Book, Chicago Public Library Best of the Best, 2012 Upstanders Award, Virginia Jefferson Cup Award, Jr. Library Guild Selection, Parents Choice Gold Award, SLJ Best Book, Publisher's Weekly Best Books, White Ravens of 2013, Bank Street College of Education Best Children's Books, NCTE Notable Books in Language Arts, and Pennsylvania Keystone to Reading Award. In an interview with Harper Collins, Cole stated \\"Your own book is your own baby. I think it's more fulfilling to both write and illustrate a book. However, it can be more fun and stimulating to collaborate with another person and create something jointly\\". Personal As a child, Cole grew up on a dairy farm and enjoyed being outdoors. His love for the outdoors is what eventually led him to study science. He has said that he spent a \\"lifetime\\" observing things in nature such as birds and leaves which has made art easier. He has also stated that he hopes to do more environmental books in the future. Cole is also inspired by artists Norman Rockwell, Paul Klee, John Singer Sargent, and N.C. Wyeth.

All athletes take them. It's really nothing special.\\"Time: An Athlete Dying Young On April 1987, Dressel's condition rapidly declined. She had taken over 100 medications in the last few months, among them steroids. After taking additional medication to relieve back pain, her body went into allergic-toxic shock on April 8, causing rapid multiple organ failure. Due to consistent overmedication, her nerves were so damaged that painkillers were useless. After three days of agony, Dressel died on April 10. An autopsy revealed traces of 101 different medications in her body.Vor 20 Jahren: Der \\"Fall Dressel\\" erschüttert den SportThe Death of Birgit Dressel ; article by Ljubodrag Simonović =Aftermath= According to the German Olympic Sports Association (DOSB), doping was common in the West German athletes of the 1980s. After her death, a 120-page report was filed where Dressel's death has been officially deemed \\"due to unknown reasons\\", but German doping analyst Werner Franke said: According to the German Olympic Sports Association (DOSB), many West German athletes \\"in fear flushed their medications down the toilet\\", but soon many reverted to the old ways of doping. \\"Helpful\\" was also the general laissez-faire attitude in West German sports with doping, as the DOSB remarked that neither in sports nor in the legal branch there was any drive to further investigate this death; doping was even called \\"therapeutic\\" by some.

Services they carry out carrying out include checking clients' credit files, instructing property valuations and checking an application fits lending criteria. In exchange for providing these services, the lender will usually pay a commission to the packager, which will usually be shared with the mortgage broker. Packagers are also sometimes able to negotiate exclusive mortgage deals with lenders that are not available directly to individual and smaller brokers, such as reduced interest rates or free property valuations. Mortgage packagers often work with a limited number of lenders, or specialise in a certain niche market. This expertise allows them to help the mortgage broker ensure an application is made to the right lender and minimise the chance of an application being rejected before it is submitted. The services of a mortgage packager cannot usually be accessed directly by members of the public. Normally when a buyer applies for a mortgage, the buyer spends time completing mortgage application forms with a mortgage broker. The mortgage application forms are then sent directly to a lender on the buyer's behalf. Once the lender is in receipt of the application and supporting paperwork they start to process the application they have received, this includes applying for the buyers employer reference, accountant references and a mortgage valuation. With this process, clients run the risk of the lender rejecting the case if the lender is not happy with everything that has been presented to them, leaving the client having to start the whole process again. However, with a mortgage packager, the case is assessed and underwritten before it gets to the lender, reducing the risk of rejection. Should the application no longer be suitable for the lender in question, there is also the facility to switch the application to a different lender without the need of completing a new application form.

He started with piano lessons as a child and on to the electric guitar as a teenager. He was a member of a couple rock bands over the years, but his true passion comes from building on his home studio and becoming a skilled engineer and producer of his own and other musicians projects. His ongoing side project, Entium, occasionally releases tracks that are on the electronica side of things. Geoff's vocal influences include artists like Dave Gahan, Jean-Luc De Meyer and Peter Murphy. =David Battrick= David has been a long-standing fixture in the Portland, Oregon music scene. He has been a past member of Monochrome, Written in Ashes, and Pharrah Phosphate. Notably, David spent 3 years studying percussion under the tutelage of Roger Allen (of the Portland Philharmonic fame). =Daniel Edgar= Daniel spent much of his early days growing up in a small Oregon town tinkering with drums, various noisemaking electronics, synthesizers and samplers. From an early age, he was inspired by European synthpop, 80s post-punk, and industrial music. Before Monody, Daniel spent time in several bands playing keyboards, bass, drums and most recently guitar.

He attended Fordham University as well as the Maryland Agricultural College. McLane starred for Fordham's baseball team as both a pitcher and outfielder, while also playing guard on the school's football team. He achieved a notable success on the diamond against Yale University on March 25, 1904.\\"Kramer's Trip Abroad; Champion Cyclist Will Meet the Best Riders of Europe.\\", The New York Times, published March 19, 1905, page 12, accessed February 28, 2008. Stepping in at the last minute when Fordham's scheduled starting pitcher was incapacitated, he led his school to a 6–3 victory, the results of which were subsequently painted on the wall of the stadium. He received offers from several professional clubs during his college career, but elected to remain in school. McLane's sole major league appearance was in the second game of a doubleheader and the last game of the season for fifth-place Brooklyn. The Superbas were playing the Boston Doves in Boston. Brooklyn lost the first game 6 to 5. In the second game, Brooklyn's pitcher, Doc Scanlan, faced Boston's rookie Sam Frock. According to The New York Times, \\"The second game rapidly degenerated into a farce, the Brooklyn players putting up a loose game in the field and at bat.\\" Scanlon lasted only ⅓ inning, giving up 3 walks and 1 hit. George Bell replaced him and did not fare much better; over the first three innings, the Superbas gave up 11 runs without scoring any. With the score 11 to 0, the game was called \\"by agreement\\" after the top of the seventh inning.Note that there are discrepancies between McLane's fielding record as reported in The New York Times box score and the record reported, for example, by baseball- reference.com. The Times shows McLane playing left field, whereas baseball- reference.com shows him playing right field, and although both sources agree that he made 1 putout, baseball-reference.com reports 2 errors, while the Times reports no errors.

It differs from ordinary histogram equalization in the respect that the adaptive method computes several histograms, each corresponding to a distinct section of the image, and uses them to redistribute the lightness values of the image. It is therefore suitable for improving the local contrast and enhancing the definitions of edges in each region of an image. However, AHE has a tendency to overamplify noise in relatively homogeneous regions of an image. A variant of adaptive histogram equalization called contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) prevents this by limiting the amplification.  Motivation and explanation of the method  Ordinary histogram equalization uses the same transformation derived from the image histogram to transform all pixels. This works well when the distribution of pixel values is similar throughout the image. However, when the image contains regions that are significantly lighter or darker than most of the image, the contrast in those regions will not be sufficiently enhanced. Adaptive histogram equalization (AHE) improves on this by transforming each pixel with a transformation function derived from a neighbourhood region. It was first developed for use in aircraft cockpit displays.D. J. Ketcham, R. W. Lowe & J. W. Weber: Image enhancement techniques for cockpit displays. Tech. rep., Hughes Aircraft. 1974. cited in R. A. Hummel: Image Enhancement by Histogram Transformation. Computer Graphics and Image Processing 6 (1977) 184195. In its simplest form, each pixel is transformed based on the histogram of a square surrounding the pixel, as in the figure below. The derivation of the transformation functions from the histograms is exactly the same as for ordinary histogram equalization: The transformation function is proportional to the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of pixel values in the neighbourhood. 300 px Pixels near the image boundary have to be treated specially, because their neighbourhood would not lie completely within the image. This applies for example to the pixels to the left or above the blue pixel in the figure. This can be solved by extending the image by mirroring pixel lines and columns with respect to the image boundary. Simply copying the pixel lines on the border is not appropriate, as it would lead to a highly peaked neighbourhood histogram.  Properties of AHE  * The size of the neighbourhood region is a parameter of the method. It constitutes a characteristic length scale: contrast at smaller scales is enhanced, while contrast at larger scales is reduced. * Due to the nature of histogram equalization, the result value of a pixel under AHE is proportional to its rank among the pixels in its neighbourhood. This allows an efficient implementation on specialist hardware that can compare the center pixel with all other pixels in the neighbourhood. An unnormalized result value can be computed by adding 2 for each pixel with a smaller value than the center pixel, and adding 1 for each pixel with equal value. * When the image region containing a pixel's neighbourhood is fairly homogeneous regarding to intensities, its histogram will be strongly peaked, and the transformation function will map a narrow range of pixel values to the whole range of the result image. This causes AHE to overamplify small amounts of noise in largely homogeneous regions of the image.K. Zuiderveld: Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization. In: P. Heckbert: Graphics Gems IV, Academic Press 1994,  Contrast Limited AHE  Ordinary AHE tends to overamplify the contrast in near-constant regions of the image, since the histogram in such regions is highly concentrated. As a result, AHE may cause noise to be amplified in near-constant regions. Contrast Limited AHE (CLAHE) is a variant of adaptive histogram equalization in which the contrast amplification is limited, so as to reduce this problem of noise amplification.S. M. Pizer, E. P. Amburn, J. D. Austin, et al.: Adaptive Histogram Equalization and Its Variations. Computer Vision, Graphics, and Image Processing 39 (1987) 355-368. In CLAHE, the contrast amplification in the vicinity of a given pixel value is given by the slope of the transformation function. This is proportional to the slope of the neighbourhood cumulative distribution function (CDF) and therefore to the value of the histogram at that pixel value. CLAHE limits the amplification by clipping the histogram at a predefined value before computing the CDF. This limits the slope of the CDF and therefore of the transformation function. The value at which the histogram is clipped, the so-called clip limit, depends on the normalization of the histogram and thereby on the size of the neighbourhood region. Common values limit the resulting amplification to between 3 and 4. It is advantageous not to discard the part of the histogram that exceeds the clip limit but to redistribute it equally among all histogram bins. 300 px The redistribution will push some bins over the clip limit again (region shaded green in the figure), resulting in an effective clip limit that is larger than the prescribed limit and the exact value of which depends on the image. If this is undesirable, the redistribution procedure can be repeated recursively until the excess is negligible.  Efficient computation by interpolation  Adaptive histogram equalization in its straightforward form presented above, both with and without contrast limiting, requires the computation of a different neighbourhood histogram and transformation function for each pixel in the image. This makes the method very expensive computationally. Interpolation allows a significant improvement in efficiency without compromising the quality of the result. The image is partitioned into equally sized rectangular tiles as shown in the right part of the figure below. (64 tiles in 8 columns and 8 rows is a common choice.) A histogram, CDF and transformation function is then computed for each of the tiles. The transformation functions are appropriate for the tile center pixels, black squares in the left part of the figure. All other pixels are transformed with up to four transformation functions of the tiles with center pixels closest to them, and are assigned interpolated values. Pixels in the bulk of the image (shaded blue) are bilinearly interpolated, pixels close to the boundary (shaded green) are linearly interpolated, and pixels near corners (shaded red) are transformed with the transformation function of the corner tile. The interpolation coefficients reflect the location of pixels between the closest tile center pixels, so that the result is continuous as the pixel approaches a tile center. 450 px This procedure reduces the number of transformation functions to be computed dramatically and only imposes the small additional cost of linear interpolation.  Efficient computation by incremental update of histogram  An alternative to tiling the image is to \\"slide\\" the rectangle one pixel at a time, and only incrementally update the histogram for each pixel,T. Sund & A. Møystad: Sliding window adaptive histogram equalization of intra-oral radiographs: effect on diagnostic quality. Dentomaxillofac Radiol. 2006 May;35(3):133-8. by adding the new pixel row and subtracting the row left behind. The algorithm is denoted SWAHE (Sliding Window Adaptive Histogram Equalization) by the original authors. The computational complexity of histogram calculation is then reduced from O(N²) to O(N) (with N = pixel width of the surrounding rectangle); and since there is no tiling a final interpolation step is not required.

The first licensed sexologist in the country, Kotb bases her methods on the teachings of the Qur'an, which she says encourages strong marital life including healthy sexual relationships between husband and wife.  Early life and education Born and raised in Egypt, Kotb grew up wanting to be a surgeon. She attended medical school at Cairo University, writing a thesis named \\"Medicolegal Implications of Sexually Transmitted Diseases in Sexually abused Children.\\" While writing her thesis, she realized that she had very little idea about normal sexuality. As a result, she began researching the topic, eventually coming across a passage in the Qur'an discussing sexual relations between husbands and wives that she saw as speaking to the woman's sexual rights. Of the experience, she said: In 2003, she became the first licensed sexologist in Egypt, graduating with a degree in clinical sexology from Maimonides University. She continued her studies, eventually earning a Ph.D with her thesis, entitled \\"Sexuality in Islam\\". The Big Talk Kotb's show, The Big Talk, is a call-in show broadcast on Al-Mehwar, an Egyptian satellite channel, where she answers questions about common sexual topics including masturbation and foreplay. Although Kotb states that she is open to most questions, as part of her proposal she agreed to not discuss sex outside of marriage and also refuses to discuss topics which are haram, or prohibited by Islam, such as sex during a woman's menses and anal sex. Although Kotb's show is extremely popular, it has drawn its share of conservative critics. Sheik Youssef al- Badri, a conservative cleric noted for his support of female circumcision, has criticized her show for \\"increas[ing] the number of sex perverts\\". Beliefs about sexuality Kotb cites Al-Baqara (\\"The Cow\\"), the longest surah (or chapter) of the Quran, as her inspiration for understanding human sexuality, noting that it speaks about the daily life of a man and woman and commands the man to provide pleasure to his wife. She argues that Islam in general and the Qu'ran in particular is very permissive of sex, and that discussion of the topic is suppressed not by religion but by culture. While this stance is seen as extremely liberal in Egypt, Kotb's beliefs about sexuality tend to be conservative by Western standards. Although she has called for women to explore their bodies, she has also stated that women do not need to masturbate, discouraging the practice by saying that \\"a woman has to remain blank until she gets married and by masturbating she's forming her sexuality.\\" References External links *Heba Kotb's official website *Interview on Al-Jazeera 1967 births Egyptian feminists Egyptian television personalities Living people People from Cairo Egyptian sexologists Sex educators ","title":"Heba Kotb"},{"id":"16003056","text":"Charles Harding Smith (24 January 1931 – 1997) was a loyalist leader in Northern Ireland and the first effective leader of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). An important figure in the Belfast-based \\"defence associations\\" that formed the basis of the UDA on its formation in 1971, Smith later became embroiled in feuds with other UDA leaders and was eventually driven out of Northern Ireland by his opponents. Development of the UDA A former soldier in the British Army Smith, at the time residing in Rosebank Street on the Shankill Road, called a meeting of other locals at the Leopold Street Pigeon Fanciers Club to develop a response to attacks by republicans from the neighboring Ardoyne area. The location was chosen because Smith was himself a pigeon fancier and a member of the club.Peter Taylor, Loyalist, Bloomsbury, 2000, p. 101 At the meeting, it was agreed to establish a vigilante group, the Woodvale Defence Association (WDA), with Smith in command assisted by Davy Fogel, who organised military drilling for the forty or so recruits, and Ernie Elliott.Henry McDonald & Jim Cusack, UDA: Inside the Heart of Loyalist Terror, Penguin Ireland, 2004, pp. 18–19 The WDA gained widespread notoriety and was blamed on a series of bomb attacks and shootings, most of which had been carried out by the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF).McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 22 Nevertheless, Smith's reputation as a hardline loyalist was boosted as a result and when his group merged with other similar vigilante movements to form the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) in late 1971 he was chosen as chairman of the new group's thirteen-member Security Council ahead of the other leading candidates Tommy Herron and Jim Anderson. According to journalist Martin Dillon, Smith was heavily influenced by William Craig and William McGrath, both of whom saw a need for a group to replace the Ulster Special Constabulary and felt that they could easily influence Smith to their way of thinking.Martin Dillon, The Trigger Men, Mainstream Publishing, 2003, pp. 173–174 Smith soon took charge of procuring arms for the UDA. In early 1972, working in tandem with Belfast businessman John Campbell who agreed to bankroll the purchases, was put in contact with a Scottish arms dealer from whom Smith was to purchase £50,000 worth of weapons. Smith sent three WDA associates, John White, Bobby Dalzell, and Robert Lusty (who was also a serving officer in the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC)), to meet the arms dealer in a London hotel, following them without attending the actual meeting. The \\"arms dealer\\" was actually a Special Branch agent and, after recording the conversation with the WDA men, arrested all three. Smith went to Scotland Yard the same day to inquire about his friends only to be arrested himself.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 28 Smith remained in custody in England until December 1972 when his case came to trial. Campbell claimed that the deal had been organised for the RUC to entrap the arms dealer, whom they believed to be a Provisional IRA member and a series of mistakes by the prosecution helped to ensure that the case collapsed with Smith acquitted.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 33Document: British saw UDA as playing 'constructive' role The trial was used as part of early arguments regarding collusion between the RUC and loyalists as a list of RUC Special Branch suspects was uncovered in Smith's house while he attempted to call Chief Constable Graham Shillington as a character witness.Tim Pat Coogan, The Troubles, London: Hutchinson, 1995, p. 143 Return to Belfast By the time Smith returned to Belfast in December 1972 there had been changes in the UDA with Tommy Herron in effective control of the organisation and Davy Fogel the dominant figure amongst the WDA. Smith immediately took back control of his west Belfast stronghold, threatening Fogel with death if he didn't fall into line. Fogel, a close ally of Ernie Elliott, who was killed in circumstances that Smith had been rumoured to be involved in, although it was later determined that Elliott was shot dead after a drunken brawl on Sandy Row had descended into a gunfight, decided it was best not to go up against Smith and stood down.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 34 However, Smith was not satisfied and, after putting out intelligence that Fogel had been taking UDA funds for himself, arrested Fogel and held him captive for three hours in a Shankill social club where he was told to leave the area. Fogel briefly left for east Belfast but when the UDA there made it clear he wasn't welcome either he left to live in England, from where he controversially gave an interview about his time in the UDA to The Sunday Times.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 35 Among claims made by Fogel in this interview was one that Smith was attempting to take control of the UDA with the help of the UVF.Coogan, The Troubles, p. 156 Smith was a strong admirer of the UVF's military structure and hoped to replicate it in the UDA but he had a deep dislike of UVF leader Gusty Spence.Dillon, The Trigger Men, pp. 179–180 As part of his remit to instil military discipline, Smith moved against a culture of racketeering that had become endemic in the west Belfast UDA during his absence. It was this initiative that led to the rumours concerning Smith's involvement in the death of Elliott, who had been named by some of his rivals in the UDA as a gangster.Dillon, The Trigger Men, p. 181 Despite Smith's show of strength following his return to Belfast his public persona remained low-key, with Herron fast emerging as the public face of the UDA. Much of this was down to the fact that Smith was inarticulate and unable to project a good image, unlike Herron who was a good talker and fairly charismatic.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 49 The emergence of these two leaders at the same time however was to bring the fledgling movement into near civil war. Following a period of marginalisation Jim Anderson, who was serving as caretaker leader of the UDA, had resigned as chairman of the UDA and as a result a meeting was called of the group's leaders in March 1973 to determine who would succeed him. By this time Smith and Herron were recognised as the undisputed leaders of the Belfast UDA; there was a fear that whichever of the two was chosen as chairman the other one would automatically feel obliged to challenge his leadership. As a result, it was determined that someone else should be appointed chairman as a compromise candidate and as Highfield-based activist Andy Tyrie, a man noted for his skill as an organiser, was chairing the conference it was decided that he would be acceptable to both men as chairman of the UDA.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, pp. 64–65 Tyrie soon proved to be a powerful rival to the two leaders. In September 1973, Herron was kidnapped and shot dead. As of 2014, his murder remains unsolved.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 68 Feud Tyrie had not proven to be the puppet Smith had hoped and had consolidated his power through his close involvement with Glenn Barr and the Ulster Workers Council during the strike of May 1974, an event that had helped to give real credence to Tyrie's leadership abilities.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, pp. 75–77 Fearing the growing power of Tyrie, Smith criticised the UDA leader for sending a delegation to Libya to meet Muammar al-Gaddafi, who was a hate figure for many loyalists due to his providing arms to the PIRA.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 85 Smith, who had known about the trip in advance but had raised no objections, verbally attacked Tyrie over the Libya debacle in a meeting of the Inner Council in December 1974 before declaring the following January that he intended to split his West Belfast Brigade from the rest of the UDA.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 86 Two weeks after announcing the schism Smith was attending a meeting at the West Belfast UDA's headquarters with Tommy Lyttle when he noticed a sniper on a nearby roof. Smith, who was wearing a bullet-proof vest, opened his coat as if to challenge the sniper to fire but was seriously wounded when the sniper did shoot twice, hitting him both times with armour-piercing bullets. With Smith in hospital Tyrie called a meeting of the leading figures in the Shankill UDA and managed to convince Lyttle and other leading figures that Smith was too divisive a figure to remain in charge. Smith was out of the hospital after only two weeks and declared himself back in charge but before long he had fallen foul of a number of important people. Two Shankill UDA members had been interned on the basis of evidence that rumours suggested had come from Smith whilst he had also clashed with the local UVF after suggesting that they merge but only on the basis that he would be in control. He began to make threats against Barr and Chicken, two popular members who were leading figures on the UDA's political side.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, pp. 86–87 Smith called a meeting of his commanders, but, in an attack arranged in advance by his opponents within the UDA, a gunman burst in and shot him twice in the chest. The gunman walked up to the injured Smith and prepared to shoot him in the head but the gun jammed and he again survived an attempt on his life.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 87 Departure Smith spent another week in hospital after which he again returned to his Belfast home. Loyalist Davy Payne was sent to his house with another hitman and the two ordered Smith to leave Northern Ireland. He was taken to the airport the following day and left for England, leaving Tyrie as sole leader of the UDA. Smith settled in Skipton, Yorkshire, where he worked as a lorry driver before his death in 1997.Dillon, The Trigger Men, p. 195 During Dáil Éireann debates in 2005 he was named as a \\"self-confessed British intelligence agent\\".Dáil Éireann debates Vol. 599, No. 6.

In 2019-20, Clyde & Co's revenue was £627 million (approximately $810 million), marking the firm’s 22nd successive year of growth.  History  Clyde & Co was founded by Scottish lawyer Richard Arthur Clyde. He came from a distinguished legal family, which in the last century has produced two Lords President of the Court of Session in Scotland. Richard Clyde's nephew, the late Lord Clyde, was a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary from 1996 to 2001. The earliest record of Dick Clyde as a solicitor in independent practice dates from 1928, although it was in 1933 that having left his position as an assistant solicitor with a well known firm of City marine lawyers, he set up his own office in Lime Street in the heart of the insurance district of the City of London. He managed to attract instructions from Lloyd's underwriters and insurance companies, and within a short time went into partnership with Maurice Hill, a member of the founding family of the Liverpool solicitors Hill Dickinson and a descendant of Sir Rowland Hill, who had established the penny post. Michael Payton, who had joined the firm in 1966, assumed the post of Senior Partner in 1984, a position he held until 2013 when he assumed the role of Chairman. James Burns was elected Clyde & Co Senior Partner in 2013, and during his tenure, Clyde & Co grew revenues by one third (£336m to £447m). More than 15 new offices were added on five continents including: Dusseldorf, Miami, Cape Town, Johannesburg, Melbourne, and Edinburgh. James Burns was named Management Partner of the year by Legal Business in April 2016.

M.S.L. programs typically last one academic year and put students through a similar regimen as first-year Juris Doctor (J.D.) students but may allow for further specialization. Despite having similar names, an M.S.L. is distinct from a Master of Laws (LL.M.), which is a second law degree offered by law schools to students who have already earned a J.D. or Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.). M.S.L. students may study such staples as constitutional law, torts, contracts, civil procedure, and other requirements alongside regular law students, writing the same papers and taking the same exams. But they typically graduate after accumulating two semesters of credit instead of six. Some M.S.L. programs are designed for academics who hold Ph.D.s in a discipline related to the law, and who want to add a legal dimension to scholarship. Other programs aim to provide fundamental legal education to professionals who are not lawyers, but whose careers involve legal or regulatory issues. Responding to this need, M.L.S. degrees are increasingly offered to working professionals on an online or part-time basis, and allow professionals to tailor elective law courses to their particular career fields. Currently, there are approximately 15 online programs available from accredited universities. Overview The degree has several variants, including a Master of Studies in Law degree (at Yale Law School, Northeastern University School of Law, The University of Iowa, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Toronto, and the University of Western Ontario), for example, or a Master in the Study of Law (at Ohio State), or a Master in Law (at the University of Pennsylvania Law School). In June 2015, Fordham University School of Law launched an M.S.L. with specializations in Corporate Compliancehttp://law.fordham.edu/complianceMSL and Fashion Law.http://law.fordham.edu/fashionlawMSL In March 2007 The Ohio Board of Regents approved M.S.L. Degree for the University of Dayton School of Law, and beginning in the Fall of 2014, Washburn University School of Law offers M.S.L. classes to individuals engaged in a wide range of parallel professions. Drexel University offers a Master of Legal Studies program as of 2013. West Virginia University offers a Master of Legal Studies (M.L.S.) completely online as part of its nationally ranked Division of Public Administration. The University of Washington School of Law offers a Masters of Jurisprudence in Employment and Human Resources, Environmental Regulation, Health Law, Indigenous Rights, Intellectual Property Law and Policy, Sustainable International Development Law, Tax Law, and Technology Law. Arizona State University also offers an M.L.S. Seattle University School of Law offers a Master of Legal Studies degree as of 2016. The John Marshall Law School in Chicago, and the Albany Law School in New York, both offer M.S. degrees in several concentrations. The Vermont Law School offers a Masters of Environmental Law and Policy (MELP) degree (formally known as the Master of Studies in Environmental Law (MSEL) degree). As of 2011, UC Hastings will be offering a Master of Studies in Law (MSL) and LLM in Law, Science and Health Policy programs together with the University of California, San Francisco. Since 2004, Friends University has offered a Master of Studies in Business Law (MSBL). Santa Barbara & Ventura Colleges of Law introduced their Master of Legal Studies (M.L.S.) program entirely online in 2012, and can be completed in under two years. Willamette University College of Law in Oregon offers a one-year Master of Legal Studies (MLS) program designed for professionals whose job involves working within a legal or regulatory framework. Trinity Law School recently introduced an online MLS program that can be taken as a general degree or with one of five emphases, most of which focus on Christian topics such as bioethics, Church and Ministry Management, and Human Rights. Loyola University Chicago School of Law offers M.J. degrees in Children's Law & Policy (online), Compliance & Enterprise Risk Management (online), Health Law (online), and Rule of Law for Development. From the mid-1970s until 2004, there was also a unique M.S.L. program at Yale Law School for journalists. The program was a competitive fellowship offered to three or four applicants a year, chosen by the university. Yale provided free tuition, and the fellows also received a living stipend provided originally by the Ford Foundation and later by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. A number of reporters who currently cover the Supreme Court or other law-related issues for major mainstream media organizations are former fellows, including Barbara Bradley of NPR (1994), Linda Greenhouse of the New York Times (1978), Charles Lane (journalist) of the Washington Post (1997), Neil A. Lewis of the New York Times (1979), Charlie Savage of the Boston Globe (2003), and Viveca Novak of Time Magazine (1986). The program lost its funding after the 2003-04 academic year when the Knight Foundation declined to renew its grant, but is still offered to doctoral students and graduates and journalists on a tuition basis. M.L.S programs offered through Stanford Law School and the University of Arizona's James E. Rogers College of Law provide the opportunity for interdisciplinary research as well as a foundational legal education in U.S. law. The University of Colorado Boulder offers an MSL degree in Ethics and Compliance, with the opportunity for a variety of specializations including: cyber- security/information privacy, health care, marijuana, and finance among some others. Appalachian School of Law also offers a Juris Masters (J.M.) to students who complete their first full semester of full letter-graded course work (Typically after the completion of their second year of law school).

At one point, the rivals quarreled over which had the best pastrami, with the Stage Deli pointing out that the Carnegie Deli's pastrami was made with water from New Jersey, and the Carnegie Deli responding that the Stage Deli's pastrami, while made with New York water, was bought from a vendor instead of home-made. Thus, New Yorkers could get the same pastrami from any deli supplied by the same vendor.Milton Parker, Allyn Freeman, How to Feed Friends and Influence People: The Carnegie Deli (2005), p. 67-68.

Florence Wolfson was born on August 11, 1915 in Manhattan. Her parents, Daniel and Rebecca Wolfson, were Russian Jewish immigrants. Daniel was a doctor and Rebecca was the proprietor of a couture shop on Madison Avenue. She had a younger brother, Irving, born in 1919. She grew up in Harlem and the Upper East Side. In 1928, she met her future husband, Nathan Howitt, whose family owned a hotel in the Catskills where the Wolfsons spent their summers. She attended Wadleigh High School, graduating at age 15. As a teenager, she met and became infatuated with famous stage actress Eva Le Gallienne.Kopppel, Lily, The Red Leather Diary, New York, 2008. .

Elkin, Queen's Hall 1893-1941 (Ryder, London 1944), p. 16, note, says 1858. It was situated between the Quadrant in Regent Street and Piccadilly, and Vine Street and George Court. There was a frontage on Regent Street, and another in Piccadilly. Taking the orchestra into account, the main hall had seating for slightly over 2,000 persons.Elkin 1944, 16. It had a grand hall long and broad, the seating was distributed between ground floor, balcony, gallery and platform and it had excellent acoustics.R. Elkin, Royal Philharmonic - The Annals of the Royal Philharmonic Society (Ryder 1946), 67. On the ground floor were two smaller halls, one square; the other by .\\"Victorian London - Buildings, Monuments and Museums - St James's Hall\\" in the Victorian Dictionary The Hall was decorated in the 'Florentine' style, with features imitating the great Moorish Palace of the Alhambra. The Piccadilly facade was given a Gothic design, and the complex of two restaurants and three halls was hidden behind Nash's Quadrant.Hobhouse, Hermione. History of Regent Street (Macdonald and Jane's, London, 1975), p. 84 Sir George Henschel recalled its 'dear old, uncomfortable, long, narrow, green-upholstered benches (pale-green horse-hair) with the numbers of the seats tied over the straight backs with bright pink tape, like office files.'H. Henschel, When Soft Voices Die (Methuen, London 1949). The Hall was built jointly by two music publishing firms, Chappell & Co. and Cramer & Co., in the hope of attracting the growing audiences for fine musical performances that attended the Crystal Palace and the halls being built in the provinces. It stood empty for nearly a year after its opening.R. Pound, Sir Henry Wood (Cassell, London 1969), 34-35. For almost half a century thereafter, the Hall was London's principal concert hall,Survey of London: volumes 31 and 32, Chapter IV to be succeeded by Queen's Hall in the 1900s and later by Wigmore Hall, the Royal Albert Hall and Royal Festival Hall. It became famous for its 'Monday Pops' concerts and Ballad Concerts, as the home of the Philharmonic Society and the Christy Minstrels and for the many famous conductors and performers who gave important performances there.  Opening  The first performance at the hall was The Hymn of Praise by the Vocal Association, under Julius Benedict.C. Pearce, Sims Reeves - Fifty Years of Music in England (Stanley Paul, London 1924), pp. 205-07. Sims Reeves sang Beethoven's 'Adelaide' there (the first of many successes), accompanied by Arabella Goddard, in a concert at the end of May 1858. According to Reeves' biographer, 'The hall itself met with general approval, but the arrangements for chorus and orchestra were severely condemned.' In the same year, one of the first complete performances of J.S. Bach's St Matthew Passion to be heard in England was given there under William Sterndale Bennett, with Sims Reeves, Helen Lemmens-Sherrington, Charlotte Sainton-Dolby and Willoughby Weiss.Reeves, Sims. My Jubilee: or, Fifty Years of Artistic Life (Simpkin, Marshall, London 1889), pp. 178-79. cf W. Sterndale Bennett (Ed.), Grosse Passions-Musik composed by John Sebastian Bach (Lamborn Cock, Hutchings, London 1862).  The Christy Minstrels  1874 Advertisement The hall became known for its continuous production of blackface minstrelsy from 1862 until 1904.According to The Encyclopædia Britannica, eleventh edition, Vol. XXI, p. 726, the Christy Minstrels played at the theatre beginning in 1862 and later evolved into the Moore and Burgess Minstrels, which continued at the hall through 1904. See also this article.Notes to \\"Ray Andrews Classic English Banjo,\\" citing Reynolds, Harry: Minstrel Memories: The Story of Burnt Cork Minstrelsy in Great Britain 1836-1927 (London, 1928) Known as the Christy Minstrels and later the Moore and Burgess Minstrels, the Hall's resident minstrel troupe performed in one of the smaller halls located on the ground floor near the restaurant, below the main hall.Elkin 1946, 67. Gilbert and Sullivan's 1893 comic opera, Utopia, Limited, contains a joke in which the Court of St. James's is purposely confused with St. James's Hall and its minstrel shows, and a parody of a minstrel number is included in the same scene.Utopia, Limited scene In residence for the whole active life of the hall, the Minstrels had their permanent home there, but their interests often conflicted with those of the main hall. In January 1890, for instance, George Bernard Shaw wrote: > At the Hallé orchestral concert... I was inhumanly tormented by a quadrille > band which the proprietors of St James's Hall (who really ought to be > examined by two doctors) had stationed within earshot of the concert-hall. > The heavy tum-tum of the basses throbbed obscurely against the rhythms of > Spohr and Berlioz all the evening, like a toothache through a troubled > dream; and occasionally, during a pianissimo, or in one of Lady Hallé's > eloquent pauses, the cornet would burst into vulgar melody in a remote key, > and set us all flinching, squirming, shuddering, and grimacing hideously.'G. > B. Shaw, London Music in 1888-89 as heard by Corno di Bassetto, etc > (Constable, London 1937), 299-300. Only a fortnight later, the band, at first subdued, broke out in a 'wild strain of brazen minstrelsy' during the final bars of the funeral march in the Eroica Symphony. After the movement was applauded a member of the audience began calling out that a complaint should be lodged, and won general approval, hear, hear, and people standing up to look at him.Shaw 1937, 305-306. On one occasion Lady Henschel and her daughter went to hear Joseph Joachim play at a Saturday 'Pop', but were so aware of the 'rhythmic gay sounds, thumping and shimmering away in a most enlivening manner', that they decided to go and hear Moore and Burgess instead.H. Henschel, When Soft Voices Die (Methuen, London 1949), 66-67.  Monday and Saturday 'Pops' and Ballad Concerts  Samuel Arthur Chappell, one of the brothers in the Chappell & Co. firm of Bond Street music publishers, who concentrated on selling brass and woodwind instruments, together with his brother Thomas, devised the idea of the Monday Popular Concerts, which established the fame and popularity of the hall.Boosey, William. Fifty years of music, London: Ernest Benn Limited (1931) George Bernard Shaw reported that the concerts at the hall contributed greatly to the spread and enlightenment of musical taste in England.Shaw 1937, 297. Monday 'Pops' were held in the evening, and Saturday 'Pops' on Saturday afternoons. These were chamber-concerts. Their programmes were almost exclusively 'classical', and consisted of piano and organ recital, singers, violinists, string quartets and other chamber ensemble.Henschel 1949, 66-67. They were managed by John Boosey, and later by William Boosey, together with Chappell. In 1861 the Musical World observed: 'classical chamber music of the highest order is brought week after week within the reach of the shilling paying masses as it has now been no less than fifty-two times at St James's Hall.... swelling the total of the Monday Popular Concerts to no less than sixty-three within two years of their foundation.... Such a result is unparalleled in the history of musical entertainments.'C. Pearce 1924, pp. 231-32. George Bernard Shaw gives an interesting narrative of the 'Pops' between 1888 and 1894.Shaw 1937, passim: G.B. Shaw, Musical Life in London 1890-1894 (Constable, London 1932), passim. Shaw admired the Joachim Quartet, led either by Joachim himself or often by Mme Wilma Norman Neruda (Lady Hallé) (and later still by Eugène Ysaÿe), with ('modest') L. Ries (2nd violin), ('solemn') Herr Strauss (viola) and the ('gentle') cellist Alfredo Piatti. This was certainly the 'star turn' in that period.Henschel 1949, 66. (The epithets are George Henschel's.) They frequently played full works, or even groups of works, at the 'Pops': their larger ensemble was often heard in the Beethoven septet. Among soloists heard in 1888-90 (the 31st and 32nd seasons)Monday 27 January 1890 was the 1105th Pop were Charles Hallé, Alma Haas (Beethoven op. 110), Agnes Zimmerman (Waldstein), Edvard Grieg, Bernhard Stavenhagen (Schumann Papillons), Arthur de Greef (Chopin), pianists; Joseph Joachim (Brahms), Mme Norman Neruda, (Bach concerto for 2 violins), violin; Bertha Moore, Charles Santley (Der Erlkönig, To Anthea), Marguerite Hall (Schubert, Brahms, Henschel), singers.Shaw 1937, 40-42, 59-61, 68, 297-99, 318, 336-338. The concerts were mixed, often consisting of a chamber-work, some songs, and instrumental solos. The Hall became known for the \\"London Ballad Concerts\\", which began in the 1860s and moved in January 1894 to Queen's Hall. They \\"were started... by Messrs Boosey 'for the performance of the CHOICEST ENGLISH VOCAL MUSIC by the MOST EMINENT ARTISTS'.\\"Elkin 1944, 91.  The Philharmonic Society  The Philharmonic Society of London, founded 1813, until 1869 gave its concerts in its rooms at Hanover Square, which had seating for only about 800. The Society decided to move permanently to St James's Hall, and a complimentary additional concert, held at St James's Hall, was given to its subscribers at the end of the 1868-69 season. Charles Santley, Charles Hallé, Thérèse Tietjens and Christina Nilsson were the soloists.Elkin 1946, 65. When the move was made, the Society remodelled its charges to obtain a wider audience and compete with the Crystal Palace and other large venues, and introduced annotated programmes. The Society remained at the hall until 28 February 1894, when it moved to the Queen's Hall.Elkin 1944, 52. There were major events in 1870-71, when a Beethoven centenary season was held, with all nine symphonies performed. The bust of Beethoven by Johann Nepomuk Schaller was presented to the Society and collected (in Pest, Hungary) by Sir William Cusins. It was exhibited at the Society's first concert in 1871, and a replica was placed at the front of the platform at every Philharmonic concert thereafter. The Society's Gold Medal incorporated an image of the bust. Another major event of 1871 was the original presentation of medals to ten distinguished musicians.Elkin 1946, 67-71. =Notable Philharmonic performers at St James's Hall= In 1871, Charles Gounod conducted a concert of his music. In 1873 Brahms's A German Requiem had its English premiere; Edward Lloyd first sang before the Society; and Hans von Bülow made his London debut, playing Beethoven's \\"Emperor\\" concerto and Bach's Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue. In 1874, Pablo de Sarasate and Camille Saint-Saëns played there, and in 1875, August Wilhelmj. Other Philharmonic Society highlights of the next few years included performances by George Henschel, Xaver Scharwenka, Émile Sauret, Joseph Joachim and Edward Dannreuther.Elkin 1946, 72-73. Changes of management were introduced in 1881 following the Society's recovery from a financial crisis. Concerts were moved from Monday to Thursday evenings, to make way for the Monday Night Popular Chamber-Concerts, known as the 'Pops'.Elkin 1946, 76. The 1881 season included two performances of Berlioz's Roméo et Juliette; Scharwenka gave the British premiere of his Piano Concerto No. 2, and Eugen d'Albert and Emma Albani appeared before the Society. Over the next two years many choral works were given with the Philharmonic Choir, including works by Franz Liszt, Anton Rubinstein, Weber, Beethoven and Brahms.Elkin 1946, 77-78. In 1883, Cusins retired as conductor, and for one season there was a team of honorary conductors. Antonín Dvořák conducted his Sixth Symphony (although it was referred to as \\"Symphony No. 1\\") in March 1884. Sir Arthur Sullivan conducted the concerts of 1885-87, and as guest conductors, Dvořák, Moritz Moszkowski and Saint-Saëns were heard in works written for the Society. Among the soloists were Tivadar Nachéz, Fanny Davies, Lillian Nordica, Ella Russell, Emma Nevada, Józef Hofmann and František Ondříček.Elkin 1946, 79-80. Most notably Saint-Saëns's Symphony No. 3 (Saint-Saëns) written at the behest of the Society, and premiered there on 19 May 1886. F. H. Cowen succeeded Sullivan as conductor from 1888-92\\\\. In his first season Edvard Grieg played his Piano Concerto in A minor and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky made his first appearance before an English audience, introducing two works. Johan Svendsen and Charles-Marie Widor also conducted in that season, and Clara Schumann made her farewell performance to the Society. Tchaikovsky returned in 1889 to conduct his Piano Concerto No. 1 with Wassily Sapellnikoff making his English debut (who three years later created a furor with the Liszt E flat concerto); and Agathe Backer-Grøndahl and Eugène Ysaÿe also made their English debuts. In 1890, Dvořák conducted his Fourth Symphony. Paderewski, who gave four recitals at St. James's Hall for his début in 1890, returned there for the Society in 1891 to perform the Saint-Saëns' C minor, and the Rubinstein D minor, concerti. Leonard Borwick and Frederic Lamond also performed there for the Society. Cowen gave many concerts of contemporary English composers such as Sullivan, Hubert Parry, Alexander Mackenzie, Charles Villiers Stanford, and of his own works.Elkin 1946, 82-85. In 1892 Alexander Mackenzie succeeded Cowen. In the 1893 season, Tchaikovsky gave the English premiere of his Fourth Symphony, Saint-Saëns conducted his Le Rouet d'Omphale and played his G minor concerto, and Max Bruch conducted his own Second Violin Concerto with Ladislas Gorski as soloist. In November 1893, a presentation was made to the Society's Secretary Francesco Berger in appreciation of ten years service. Soon afterwards, Queen's Hall opened its doors, and the Society moved there in the following February.Elkin 1944, 52; Elkin 1946, 87-88.  Subscription Concerts  Hans Richter often conducted Richard Wagner concerts at St. James's Hall, beginning in 1877.Elkin 1944, 23. These 'Orchestral Festival Concerts' (established regularly in 1879 by the violinist Hermann FrankeHenschel 1949, 61.), which commenced after Easter, were among the chief rivals to the Philharmonic Society programmes. At the time of Arthur Sullivan's resignation of the Philharmonic conductorship, the Society suggested to Richter that he might become its conductor, and the two series of concerts might be amalgamated under the Society's supervision. Richter did not accept the plan.Elkin 1946, 82. In addition to Richter's series, there was also a nine- year winter series of subscription concerts established and conducted by George Henschel, including a full cycle of Beethoven symphonies in one year, and a rare performance of Richard Wagner's Symphony. The content was planned against a 'permanent background' of Beethoven and Brahms. Helen Henschel refers to 'the famous Wagner cat' which inhabited the Hall. It was said to walk onto the stage during rehearsals whenever any work by Wagner was being played, but never otherwise.H. Henschel, When Soft Voices Die (Methuen, London 1949), 69. Shaw refers to both, noting that Richter's concerts were too expensive, and that Henschel's orchestra was too small.Shaw 1937, 59. Readings by Charles Dickens 1868 Program book for the series of Dickens readingsIn 1868, famed Victorian author Charles Dickens presented a final series of \\"Farewell Readings,\\" at the hall, which commenced on the evening of October 6, with a program devoted to \\"Doctor Marigold\\" (from the Christmas Story) and \\"The Trial\\" from Pickwick. He had settled with his tour managers, Chappell & Co., on 100 readings for the princely sum of £8,000 pounds. Attendees would receive printed programs and Chappell's advertisements included the following statement: > It is scarcely necessary for Messrs. CHAPPELL and Co. to add that any > announcement made in connexion with these FAREWELL READINGS will be strictly > adhered to and considered final; and that on no consideration whatever will > Mr. DICKENS be induced to appoint an extra night in any place in which he > shall have been once announced to read for the last time. The stalls were priced at five shillings, balcony seats at three, and general admission at one shilling. A new amenity, sofa stalls (\\"of which there will be a limited number only\\"), went for seven shillings. The following year Dickens would have to cut a provincial tour short after collapsing showing symptoms of a mild stroke in Preston on 22 April 1869. When he had regained sufficient strength, he arranged, with medical approval, for a series of readings to partially make up to Chappell & Co. what they had lost due of his illness. There were to be twelve final performances, running starting on 11 January 1870 back at the hall. Dickens would give his last public reading here at 8:00 pm on the 15 March 1870. He died shortly thereafter on 9 June, having suffered another stroke.NYPL, Berg Collection  Other uses  The Bach Choir, established in 1875 under a founding committee including Sir George Grove and Sir John Stainer, had as a primary aim the introduction to England of Bach's Mass in B Minor. With a choir of between 200 and 250 voices, including the Swedish Nightingale, Jenny Lind, and under the baton of her husband, conductor Otto Goldschmidt, the Mass came to performance in April 1876 at St James's Hall, and a second performance was given a month later.Elkin 1944, 62. Henry J. Wood performed the E minor organ concerto of Ebenezer Prout at the Hall with an orchestra under Joseph Barnby, in the late 1880s. Although the performance earned him much praise, he referred to the instrument as 'that terrible box of whistles at St. James's Hall'.H. Wood, My Life of Music (Gollancz, London 1946 edition), 31. This had not seemed to bother Camille Saint-Saëns when he premiered his third Symphony there (in which two sections make extensive use of the organ) in 1886. Saint-Saëns was a fine organist, and was titulaire of Église de la Madeleine in Paris. If he had any objections to the organ of St. James Hall for the premier of his symphony, they do not appear in his writings. The Stock Exchange Orchestral Society, founded 1883, originally played in the Prince's Hall Piccadilly, but transferred to St. James's Hall until 1894, when they moved to Queen's Hall.Elkin 1944, 104. In December 1893 Harry Plunket Greene and Leonard Borwick began their celebrated partnership in lieder recitals at the hall, which continued well into the new century. In 1895, the 16-year-old pianist Mark Hambourg gave a concert there under Henry J. Wood, in which he played three piano concerti.  The end of the Hall  Philharmonic Hall (originally the new St James's Hall) in Great Portland Street as it appeared in 1917. The Chappell ballad concerts were being managed by William Boosey in 1902, when the hall was owned by a private company. The controlling share was held by T. P. Chappell, chairman of Chappell's: he turned down a good offer to buy the hall because Boosey felt strongly about its old connection with the Saturday and Monday 'Pops' and the Chappell ballad concerts. But Chappell died in June 1902, and the other shareholders accepted a new offer without consulting Boosey, who was badly put out. Then Queen's Hall came into the market, and a friend of Boosey's acting in that interest pointed out that Queen's Hall would be worth much more if St James's Hall ceased to operate. Boosey realised that Messrs Chappell could benefit most by becoming lessors of Queen's Hall, and it was immediately arranged with the result that Chappell's controlled Queen's Hall from 1902 down to 1944.Elkin 1944, 20-21. The 11-year-old violinist Franz von Vecsey made his English debut at St James's Hall in April or early May 1904.Elkin 1944, 30. It continued in use until February 1905 when it was demolished. Le Méridien Piccadilly Hotel was afterwards built on the site.Elkin 1944, 16, n. 1907 building A new St. James's Hall at Great Portland Street, (on a site previously occupied by St Paul's Church) had its foundation stone laid by the Lord Mayor and Sherriffs on 20 April 1907.\\"Court Circular\\", The Times, 6 April 1907, p. 7 It opened on 25 April 1908 with a series of promenade concerts performed by the newly formed St. James's Hall Orchestra under the musical directorship of Mr. Lyell Taylor.\\"Concerts\\", The Times, 6 April 1908, p. 8 References External links *Victorian London - St James's Hall (Victorian London) *Images of the first hall (British History On-line) *\\"The St. James's Hall Christy Minstrels' Illustrated 'Christmas Annual'\\" - 1868 Former buildings and structures in the City of Westminster Former concert halls in London Music venues completed in 1858 1858 establishments in England 1905 disestablishments ","title":"St James's Hall"},{"id":"16003597","text":"Nataša Vojnović () (Serbian Cyrillic: Наташа Војновић) is a Bosnian Serb supermodel, who participated in the Elite Model Look of 1996.

Together with other European states, the Netherlands is often at or near the head in international civil liberties and political rights rankings.See Freedom House rankinggg, 2005 . Switzerland received the highest possible grade, 1, in both political rights and civil liberties. See also the Netherlands' entry in List of indices of freedom. Per year there are about 6,000 victims of and 100 convictions for human trafficking. Despite this, the Netherlands is considered to have one of the best human rights records in the world. Constitutional rights The first chapter of the Dutch constitution codifies the rights of all inhabitants of the Netherlands. These are both negative and positive rights as well as democratic rights. This includes a ban on discrimination (the first article of the Netherlands), the freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of association and freedom of assembly and the right to privacy. These are limitations on government, which citizens can enforce these classical civil rights directly at the judge. Additionally there are social rights such as the right to housing, social security, health care, education and employment. These are duties of the government towards its citizens, but these cannot be enforced by a judge. Democratic rights include the passive and active right to vote. The Netherlands has banned capital punishment during peace time and war time. The Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations is responsible for the constitution. In the Netherlands there are still some legacy laws conflicting with the freedom of speech. Lèse- majesté and Blasphemy law (amongst others), the latter was officially abolished on February 1, 2014.Wet van 23 January 2014 tot wijziging van het Wetboek van Strafrecht in verband met het laten vervallen van het verbod op godslastering, Stb. 2014, 39. (Law of January 23, 2014, to amend the Criminal Code in connection with the abolishment of the ban on blasphemy) The Netherlands is signatory to all relevant international human rights instruments such as European Convention on Human Rights, Rome Statute (for the International Criminal Court) and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, European Convention on Torture and the European Social Charter. Practice Several institutions are involved in the protection of classical human rights, in addition to the Supreme Court, the Commission Equal Treatment (non- discrimination), the Board Protection Personal Information (privacy) and the National Ombudsman. In 2007 Amnesty International criticised the Dutch government of several human rights issues, including war crimes in the Iraq War, the treatment of alleged terrorists and the detention of migrants, especially children and an incident surrounding a fire in an asylum seeker detention centre. In 2005 The US Department of State observed several problems with human rights such as the societal discrimination and violence against religious and ethnic minorities, especially after the murder of Theo van Gogh and the human trafficking in women and girls for sexual exploitation. =Human trafficking= Human trafficking is a widely recognised problem. The Netherlands is listed by the UNODC as a top destination for victims of human trafficking. In the Netherlands, it is estimated that there are from 1,000 to 7,000 trafficking victims a year. Most police investigations relate to legal sex businesses, with all sectors of prostitution being well represented, but with window brothels being particularly overrepresented. In 2008, there were 809 registered trafficking victims, 763 were women and at least 60 percent of them were forced to work in the sex industry. All victims from Hungary were female and were forced into prostitution. Out of all Amsterdam's 8,000 to 11,000 prostitutes, more than 75% are from Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia, according to a former prostitute who produced a report about the sex trade in Amsterdam, in 2008. An article in Le Monde in 1997 found that 80% of prostitutes in the Netherlands were foreigners and 70% had no immigration papers. In 2000, the Netherlands established the Dutch National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings and Sexual Violence against Children to report on the progress of the Dutch Government in combating human trafficking, which produced its first report in 2002. By 2017 it is estimated that more than 6000 people in the Netherlands are human trafficked each year, 4000 largely local women for sexual slavery and abuse, and 2000 largely foreign men for work by organized crime groups. Each year 1320 Dutch minor girls are being trafficked for sexual slavery and abuse. Torture and ill treatment According to the Council of Europe anti-torture Committee, there were several violations of human rights committed by Dutch officials. =Police brutality= In 2009, two police officers from Bleiswijk approached a homeless man sleeping on the grass in a town park, detained him, and drove him away to a place north of Moerkapelle. They then told him to dig his own grave, whilst threatening him with guns. The homeless man was left there. The incident came up only because one of the policemen has reported the incident to his superior. Both policemen were discharged and sentenced to six months in prison. House visit controversy People on welfare in the Netherlands can get a house visit by inspectors without any concrete suspicion of fraud required. Because forcing entry would be in conflict with the right to privacy, the citizen in question is asked permission to enter. However, if entry is denied, they can be cut on their income. It is not accepted for the residents to make video recordings of this event in their own home. A significant large part of the Dutch population is potentially exposed these privacy invasive measures as they do not only apply to people on unemployment welfare but other benefits as well. International law The Netherlands hosts several international human rights institutions. The Hague is home to the International Criminal Court, the Yugoslavia Tribunal, the International Court of Justice, Rwanda Tribunal.

Life  He joined the Dominican Order at Pisa in 1494. He was involved in the attempted take-over of the Milanese convent of Sant'Eustorgio by the Observant friars of the Congregation of Lombardy before becoming master of studies at the Dominican studio in Bologna in 1513–4. He served as inquisitorial vicar in Modena from 1517–9, where he was involved in prosecuting witches, and then regent master at S. Domenico in Bologna in the early 1530s. He was appointed (1536) by the Venetian Senate to the chair of theology at the University of Padua. He was also for a time socius of the Master-General of the Order of Preachers, and prior provincial of the Holy Land. In July, 1542, he was made Master of the Sacred Palace by Pope Paul III, and during the four years that he discharged the duties of that office he rendered services to the Holy See and to the Fathers of the Council of Trent, regarding many difficult and mooted questions. As Master of the Sacred Palace, he was said to have wanted to move against Copernicus' De revolutionibus, only stopped by his death. From the year 1518 Spina was engaged in a heated controversy with his famous confrère, Cardinal Cajetan. Still more harsh was his opposition to Ambrose Catharinus, whom he denounced as guilty of heresy to Paul III about the beginning of the year 1546.  Works  The most important of Spina's works are: *\\"Tutela Veritatis de Immortalitate Animæ contra Petrum Pomponatium\\" and *\\"Flagellum in Tres Libros Apologiæ Pomponatii de Immortalitate Animæ\\", both published in 1518. Of special interest are also *\\"Tractatus de Strigibus et Lamiis\\" (Venice, 1523), and *\\"Apologiæ Tres adversus Joann. Franc. Ponzinibium Jurisperitum\\" (Venice, 1525). He also edited many works of Thomas Aquinas, including his commentary on the Physics, Metaphysics, and logical works, as well as some of his Biblical commentaries (Matthew, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Lamentations). In his treatise \\"De Conceptione B. Mariæ Virg.\\" (Venice, 1533), Spina opposed the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception.  References  *Alva y Astorga, Monumenta Dominicana: pro immac. concept.

In an experiment, in which he combined styrene with isobutylene, he created a unique material that was solid yet flexible due to the tiny bubbles formed by isobutylene within the styrene. McIntire had invented foam polystyrene, more commonly known by its brand name, Styrofoam, that was 30 times lighter and more flexible than solid polystyrene. It was also inexpensive and moisture resistant. McIntire remained at The Dow Chemical Company for his entire career.

By the end of the 1940s, Hebmüller's economic situation was deteriorating. The company also suffered from a massive fire at its Wülfrath factory on 23 July 1949, which could not be extinguished because of water shortage. Almost the entire factory was destroyed. The company never recovered from the destruction, although the factory itself was rapidly rebuilt, and in 1949 alone more than 350 more cars were produced.

History =World War I= 28th Aero Squadron, unit photograph, Foucaucourt Airdrome, France, 18 November 1918 Established in 1917 as the 28th Aero Squadron after the United States' entry into World War I. Formed at Camp Kelly, Texas, then sent to Quebec for combat flying training with units of the Royal Flying Corps. Deployed on the to the Western Front in France and served with the British Second and American Fifth Armies from 20 March until c. 24 June 1918 (C flight participated in Somme Defense from 21 March to 6 April 1918). The 28th also saw combat as a pursuit unit with the First United States Army from 2 September 1918 until 10 November 1918. The squadron returned from France in June 1919 and was demobilized. During World War I, it had two aces in its ranks, Martinus Stenseth and Thomas Cassady.Franks & Dempsey, p. 86 =Inter-war years= After World War I, the 28th Squadron (Bombardment), was constituted as a new unit on 30 August 1921. It was organized on 20 September at Mather Field, California and assigned to the Ninth Corps Area. The squadron was equipped with Dayton-Wright DH-4s and was used for aerial forest fire patrols along the western side of the Sierra Mountains and Sacramento, California area. On 19 January 1922, it was consolidated with its World War I predecessor unit, the 28th Aero Squadron, giving it a history dating to 22 June 1917. The unit was inactivated on 28 June 1922 with the closure of Mather Field.Clay, The squadron was reactivated on 1 September 1922 at Clark Field, Philippine Islands and assigned to the Philippine Department. It was moved to Kindley Field, on Corregidor Island and again equipped with DH-4s. Assigned to the 4th Group (Composite) (later 4th Composite Group), the 28th was redesignated the 28th Bombardment Squadron on 25 January 1923. Along with the 2d Observation and 3d Pursuit Squadrons, the 28th provided the bombardment capability of the Air Service in the Philippines during the 1920s and 1930s. Its mission was tactical training for coastal defense. Exercises and maneuvers with Army ground forces and Naval forces were a regular and important part of its mission. The squadron was moved to the Manila area in 1922, operating from time to time from either Clark or Nichols Fields.Edmonds, Along with the venerable DH-4, the 28th was equipped with the Martin NBS-1 bomber (also known as the MB-2) built during the final months of World War I. The MB-2 was the standard bomber of the Air Service throughout the 1920s, the squadron being upgraded to the Keystone LB-5 in 1929, then the Keystone B-3 in 1931. Also, the 28th flew the Loening OA-1 amphibian which it operated from Manila Bay. The obsolete Keystones were replaced by the Martin B-10 in 1937. In June 1938, the squadron moved to Clark Field. As a result of the rising tensions with the Japanese Empire in 1940, the defenses of the Philippines were judged to be abysmal, and a reinforcement effort was made to defend the islands against any Japanese aggression. The 28th Squadron received Douglas B-18 Bolos in early 1941, and later, some early-model Boeing B-17C Flying Fortresses. On 1 November, it was assigned to the incoming 19th Bombardment Group in a reorganization of the Far East Air Force (FEAF) assets in the Philippines. The 28th, however, was filled with new pilots fresh out of flight training that were sent to reinforce the Philippines. The incoming 19th Group used the 28th as a fourth squadron, deploying two of its squadrons (the 30th and 93d) from March Field, California to the Philippines between 16 October and 4 November 1941 with more modern B-17Es, and the 14th Bombardment Squadron, which had arrived in September as its third squadron. The 28th also had eighteen B-18s on the line at Clark. By 1 December 1941, the 19th Bombardment Group had all four of its squadrons at Clark Field. It was decided to disperse the Group and move the 14th-or-30th and 93d squadrons south to Del Monte Field on Mindanao. Del Monte, however, was little more than a grass field cut out of a pineapple farm with no supporting hangars, supplies, shops or other infrastructure to support the bombers. On 7 December, there were 35 B-17s in the Philippines, with the 19th and 14th Squadrons at Clark Field on Luzon with a total of 19 planes (B-17Ds and B-17Es), and two squadrons at Del Monte 500 miles to the south with the other 16 B-17Es. A fifth squadron, the 38th Reconnaissance Squadron with four B-17Cs and two new B-17Es was inbound from Hamilton Field, California to Pearl Harbor on their way to the Philippines to reinforce the American force there, and was expected to arrive in a week. =World War II=  Battle of the Philippines After the Pearl Harbor Attack on 7 December 1941 in Hawaii, Clark Field was put on alert for a Japanese attack. FEAF Commanding General Lewis H. Brereton sought permission from theater commander General Douglas MacArthur to conduct air raids against Japanese forces on Formosa, but was refused. It was a little before 0800 when Brereton returned to Air Headquarters at Nielson Field. As he entered his office he asked what decision the staff had reached, but on being told said, \\"No, We can't attack till we're fired on\\" and explained that he had been directed to prepare the B-17s for action but was not to undertake offensive action till ordered. Later, about 1100 on 8 December7 December in Hawaii was 8 December in the Philippines. a combat strike was approved by FEAF against Formosa. Just as the B-17s were on the line, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service attacked Clark Field and practically destroyed the Army Air Corps capability of conducting an offensive action against the enemy. Damage to the physical structures at Clark Field was immense. This included the barracks which housed the personnel of the 28th. As a result, the entire squadron was ordered to bivouac in a nearby rifle pit. Confusion was the order of the day. A limited few were assigned to help repair and salvage parts of the remaining planes. There was very little for the remaining squadron personnel to do. =Infantry= With almost all of the squadron's aircraft destroyed at Clark, the men of the ground echelon were pressed into service as infantry under 5th Interceptor Command. On Christmas Eve of 1941, the 28th evacuated Clark Field and went by train to Bataan. The squadron was bivouacked approximately two miles east of Corregidor Island. On 29 December, the 28th received orders to travel to the port of Mariveles. During its journey to the port, men of the squadron witnessed the Japanese air force attempting to bomb Corregidor. Arriving at the port of Mariveles, they were instructed to board the inter-island steamer, the . That evening, about 21:00 the ship sailed from the port. It traveled all night, and at daylight, anchored off the Island of Mindoro in an attempt to keep away from the enemy naval forces. However, that area was not a sanctuary, inasmuch as a Japanese patrol bomber spotted the Mayon and attempted to bomb it. The plane dropped six bombs without making a serious hit on the ship. At nightfall, the ship once again initiated its journey southward. The next morning, it anchored in a small cove for protection once again. There was an enormous amount of life preservers and debris on the water on this cove. It was later learned that the Japanese had sunk the sister ship of the Mayon, named the , where the Mayon anchored. That night, the ship sailed once more and arrived at the port of Bago, Mindanao the next morning. At Bago, the men of the 28th were issued some old British Lee–Enfield rifles fully coated with cosmoline. After cleaning their rifles, the men embarked on buses at Malaybalay and stayed overnight. The next day, the enlisted men of the 28th, along with a few officers, were transported further southward by bus to Carmen Ferry on the Pulangi River. They were approximately forty miles from the city of Davao, where the Japanese armed forces were entrenched. its orders were to guard the ferry and patrol the Pulangi River. On 16 April 1941, the personnel of the 28th Bomb Squadron were ordered north to Maramag, Mindanao. Maramag was the planned site of a secret airfield which was hopefully to be used by FEAF. However, this part of the Philippine Islands defense plans were never fully developed due to enemy action. On 7 May 1942, most of the personnel of the 28th, along with servicemen from other Air Corps units of the 19th Group, were ordered to embark for an area in northern Mindanao known as Alanib. At Alanib, the entire group started on a twenty three kilometer hike to another area in the center of Mindanao named Bosok. This area was not accessible by truck. The group's assignment was to prepare entrenchments for Filipino troops to guard a back trail which could have permitted the Japanese armed forces on Mindanao. The American force, having reached approximately one kilometer from its destination of Bosok, was ambushed by a Japanese patrol. The infiltration had already begun. Fortunately, there were few casualties during the encounter. However, having only shovels and no weapons, the entire force proceeded to backtrack toward Alanib, the embarkation point. The Japanese patrol was in hot pursuit. However, there were U.S. Army trucks at Alanib when the men arrived. The drivers of the trucks informed the men of the 28th that all of the American armed forces in the Philippine Islands had been ordered to surrender as of that day. At Alanib, the ground echelon of the 28th Bombardment Squadron surrendered to the Japanese as ordered on 10 May 1942, although some presumably joined guerrilla forces and continued fighting as unorganized resistance during the Japanese Occupation. The trucks transported the men of the 28th to Maramag and then to a prisoner of war camp at Malaybaly, Mindanao. After their surrender, a number of the 28th personnel died in Japanese Prisoner of war camps and on the Japanese Hell ships en route to Japan. =Air echelon= The surviving squadron aircraft were sent to Del Monte Field on Mindanao, but were unable to operate effectively against the invading Japanese forces. From Del Monte, the few aircraft began reconnaissance and bombardment operations against Japanese shipping and landing parties until 17 December when badly in need of depot maintenance, the 28th began displacing south to Darwin, Australia. The air echelon of squadron retreated to Australia, reforming at Batchelor Airfield near Darwin, Northern Territory.5TH Air Force USAAF in Australia, 1942–1945 Squadron deployed aircraft from Australia to Java in January 1942 to support Allied forces during the Dutch East Indies Campaign, carrying out bombing missions against the advancing Japanese forces. Allied withdraw from Java forced squadron to return to Australia in March. In Australia, squadron was reformed as part of Fifth Air Force, receiving aircraft and crews from the United States which had arrived in Australia after the Pearl Harbor Attack. Flew combination of B-17C/D/E aircraft; participated in the Battle of the Coral Sea in May 1942, and raided enemy transportation and communications targets as well as troop concentrations during the Japanese invasion of Papua New Guinea. The squadron bombed enemy airdromes, ground installations, and shipping near Rabaul, New Britain in August 1942. By late 1942, the USAAF decided that no more B-17s would be sent to the Pacific, and that units would be withdrawn or re-equipped in the Pacific in favor of the longer-ranged Consolidated B-24 Liberator. In addition, the combat losses by Eighth Air Force in Europe were reaching such magnitude that the entire B-17 production was urgently needed for replacements and training in that theater. Leaving its remaining B-17 aircraft in Australia, squadron personnel returned to the United States in December 1942. The men of the 28th Squadron distinguished themselves during the Battle of the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies campaign by severely disrupting the timetable of the Japanese armed forces in conquering Southeast Asia. This gave the United States government and its Allies sufficient time to arm Australia, halt the Japanese advance in Southeast Asia, and then proceed with the task of winning the war. B-29 Superfortress operations against Japan Reformed as a B-17 heavy bomber Replacement Training Unit assigned to Second Air Force in Texas. The squadron conducted replacement training from 1 February 1943 until 1 April 1944, when it was inactivated. Shortly before inactivation, the squadron was designated the 28th Bombardment Squadron, Very Heavy. The squadron was activated the same day as a Boeing B-29 Superfortress very heavy bombardment squadron. When training was completed moved to North Field (Guam) in the Mariana Islands of the Central Pacific Area in January 1945 and assigned to XXI Bomber Command, Twentieth Air Force. Its mission was the strategic bombardment of the Japanese Home Islands and the destruction of its war-making capability. Flew \\"shakedown\\" missions against Japanese targets on Moen Island, Truk, and other points in the Carolines and Marianas. The squadron began combat missions over Japan on 25 February 1945 with a firebombing mission over Northeast Tokyo. The squadron continued to participate in wide area firebombing attack, but the first ten-day blitz resulting in the Army Air Forces running out of incendiary bombs. Until then the squadron flew conventional strategic bombing missions using high explosive bombs. The squadron continued attacking urban areas until the end of the war in August 1945, its subordinate units conducted raids against strategic objectives, bombing aircraft factories, chemical plants, oil refineries, and other targets in Japan. The squadron flew its last combat missions on 14 August when hostilities ended. Afterwards, its B 29s carried relief supplies to Allied prisoner of war camps in Japan and Manchuria Remained on Guam after the war conducted sea-search, photographic mapping, and training missions in the western Pacific. Deployed to Kadena Air Base, Okinawa in June 1950 as a result of the Korean War. Flew strategic bombing missions over North Korea; targets included an oil refinery and port facilities at Wonsan, a railroad bridge at Pyongyang, and Yonpo Airfield. After United Nations ground forces pushed the communists out of South Korea, the squadron turned to strategic objectives in North Korea, including industrial and hydroelectric facilities. It also continued to attack bridges, marshalling yards, supply centers, artillery and troop positions, barracks, port facilities, and airfields. Continued bombardment operations until the June 1953 armistice in Korea; returned to the United States in May 1954; the squadrons B-29s being sent to reclamation. =Strategic Air Command= 28th Bomb Squadron B-1B Lancers release chaff and flares while maneuvering during a training mission 24 February 2010 Reactivated in May 1954 with new Boeing B-47 Stratojet medium bombers and personnel at Pinecastle Air Force Base, near Orlando, Florida under Strategic Air Command (SAC). Engaged in training operations and participated in numerous SAC exercises and deployments with the B-47 until 1961 when the B-47s began to be phased out of SAC. Re-equipped with Boeing B-52H Stratofortresses in 1962 at Homestead Air Force Base, Florida. Flew intercontinental training missions with the Stratofortress, and maintained nuclear alert. Re-equipped with B-52G model in 1968 and moved to Robins Air Force Base. Deployed personnel and aircraft several times to forward bases in the Western Pacific, carrying out combat missions over Indochina under Operation Arc Light, Operation Linebacker I and the Linebacker II raids of 1972–73 at the end of the Vietnam War. Squadron reformed at Robins in 1973 and returned to nuclear alert status. Inactivated in 1983 as part of the phaseout of the B-52G from the SAC inventory. Reactivated in 1987 and re-equipped with the Rockwell B-1B Lancer strategic bomber. Stationed initially at McConnell Air Force Base, Kansas, the squadron moved to Dyess Air Force Base, Texas in 1994 and transferred to the 7th Wing when McConnell was realigned as a tanker base. Currently, the 28th conducts weapons system training for B-1 crews. Each year, it trains more than 200 active duty crewmembers.

The prehistory of Stockholm is the continuous development and series of events that made the mouth of Lake Mälaren strategically important; a location which by the mid 13th century had become the centre of the newly consolidated Swedish kingdom. The origin of Stockholm pre-dates its written history, and several mythological stories and modern myths have attempted to explain both its emergence and its name.  Prehistory  North-bound cliffs of Södermalm Stockholm stands on a bedrock of gneiss and granite approximately 2 billion years old. Over millions of years, north-west to south-east oriented cracks appeared in the rock, which rivers transformed into the valleys still present in the landscape, for example the lakes Långsjön, Magelungen, and Drevviken. All around Stockholm, such open fields are separated by forest-laden ridges. Late in this geological process, east to west-oriented faults appeared, resulting in for example the tall, dark cliffs along the northern waterfront of Södermalm.Andersson, Stockholms årsringar, pp 13-17 Three million years ago, a series of ice ages started to grind down the north-bound faults, leaving the south-bound formations intact. During the latest ice age (70,000-9,500 BCE), the area surrounding Stockholm was covered by an ice layer up to two kilometres thick. While the ice effectively eliminated every trace of pre-ice age life, it is assumed humans probably did inhabit the area before the ice age, notwithstanding no archaeological traces can confirm it. Nevertheless, bones from a mammoth have been found in the Brunkebergsåsen esker stretching north to south through central Stockholm.Stockholm County Museum, Istid As ice lightened its grip of the area about 11,500 BCE, the area was inundated by melt water before the land started to rise and the first islets rose over the water surface (at the time located about 40 metres over the present sea level).Stockholm County Museum, Stenåldern The retiring ice left behind a cover of sand, gravel, and rocks forming moraine ridges still witnessing how the ice gave up some 250 m annually over two centuries. Under the ice sheet, streams formed eskers, most notably the huge Brunkebergsåsen, the steep slopes of which still form barriers in central Stockholm. After some 1000 years the first humans settled in the area to start the Stone Age era characterized by a climate similar to that of the present Mediterranean Sea. Due to land elevation, the archaeological traces of these first coastal settlements are today found far from the coast and the modern metropolitan area. The traces consists of various tools, including quartz and flint arrowheads used by these hunter- gatherers to catch mostly seals.Stockholm County Museum, Äldre stenåldern During the end of the Stone Age (4200-1800 BCE) humans started to use more stationary settlements, solid buildings standing on strong poles drilled into the ground, even if the access to food still made migratory periods necessary. Graves got more elaborate as grinned axes made of carefully selected and often imported rocks accompanied the dead together with ceramics, fancy garments, and other impressive objects.Stockholm County Museum, Yngre stenåldern  Emergence  The remains of the entrance into Birka with the cross of St Ansgar in the background. The first town in the Lake Mälaren region was undoubtedly Birka on Björkö island about 20 km west of present-day Stockholm. Founded in the late 8th century, it was described by Rimbert, Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen, who wrote about his predecessor Ansgar's missionary journeys c. 830 and 850. For unknown reasons, Birka was deserted around 975. Shortly thereafter, Sigtuna appeared on the northern shores of Mälaren. Located on the main navigable approach to Uppsala, Sigtuna is believed to have been designed as missionary outpost and a Christian trade centre rivalling the still pagan Uppsala. While Sigtuna saw its heyday during the 10th century, the Blackfriars decided to construct their first monastery in Sweden at Sigtuna in the 1230s (inaugurated 1247), which seem to indicate Sigtuna was still the city dominating the Mälaren region at that time.Hall, pp 13-16 Ruins of the St Olof Church at Sigtuna. Notwithstanding surviving records makes it difficult to see exactly when and in what order events took place, several causes for the development to occur in the 13th century can be distinguished: Of the half dozen trade posts in Sweden described in 1120 as cathedral cities or cities with a potential to become such, Sigtuna is believed to be the only one with the density and status of a city in the proper sense. This quickly changed as German merchants introduced developed forms of production and 'industrialised' Swedish mining, mostly during the second half of the 13th century. This rewrote the regional map and resulted in the gradual development of a Swedish urbanity. As trade routes moved westward in the Mälaren region, Sigtuna found itself left astern.Hall, p 48-49 Solna parish, today a northern suburb. The Solna Church is one of three round churches in Stockholm dating back to the late 12th century and thus older than Stockholm.Andersson, pp 26-27 Birger jarl's elimination of the \\"true Folkungs\\" between 1247 (Battle of Sparrsätra) and 1251 (Battle of Herrevadsbro) lead to increased consolidation of the Swedish kingdom and the introduction of a continental feudal society. Additionally, the Swedish dominion expanded east as Birger jarl and Torgils Knutsson conquered Tavastland and Karelia (later Finland) which placed present-day Stockholm, until then an insignificant peripheral island, in the absolute centre of the small empire. Lastly, navigation on Lake Mälaren changed dramatically as land elevation isolated it from the Baltic Sea during the 13th century and made the strait in what is today central Stockholm the only navigable passage into the Lake Mälaren region. It remains uncertain when this happened more precisely, but the development was further accelerated by the growth of international trade in the Baltic. The streams around Stadsholmen can't have been much of a problem for Viking longships or traditional knarrs, but as German merchants introduced the sea-going deep- draught cogs, the straits and streams at the mouth of Lake Mälaren became insurmountable obstacles which thus created a need for a trading post at the location. While the oldest traces of human activities in present Stockholm are considerably older, the development as described above preceded the foundation of the city on its present location. However, Birka, Sigtuna, and Stockholm forms a series of urban structures which can be thought of as the capital of the Lake Mälaren region, at a few occasions relocated to fit into the socio- economic structure of the day.  Icelandic sagas  Agne being hung by Skjalf and other imprisoned Finns. Lithography by Hugo Hamilton, 1830. The watercourse passing south of the old town of Stockholm first appears in historical records as the somewhat cryptic phrase: \\"What split off is called Stockholm\\" (Stockholm heter det som sprack av), found in a version of the Saga of the Saint Olaf by the Icelandic author Stymer Frode, preserved through a manuscript from the 14th century. Stymer explains, what today are the islands Södermalm and Stadsholmen was at the time united by an isthmus, and Saint Olaf of Norway (995-1030) produced the strait, in the saga called Konungssund (\\"King's strait\\"), by summoning assistance from superior forces. A slightly different version, undoubtedly the most famous, is the account of the Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson (1178–1241). He retells, while King Olav of Norway raided the Lake Mälaren area, the Swedish king Olof Skötkonung (960s-1021/1022) hoped to trap him by pulling an iron chain over Stocksund (\\"Log Strait\\", e.g. modern Norrström passing north of the old town), a strait in addition guarded by a castellum and an army on either sides. The Norwegian king then dug himself through the southern isthmus and, helped by vivid streams produced by spring flood and favourable winds, managed to have his ships break through the foreshore and shoals, and finally escaped to the Baltic Sea. Snorri however adds, the Swedes refuted this version as drivel.Söderlund, Slussen, pp 11-21  Agnefit  Gustav Vasa in the 16th century. Stockholm derives its mythological origin from a dwelling place called Agnefit. The second element fit means 'moist meadow' and, arguably, the only possible location for a meadow in present-day Stockholm at the time was on the western shore of today's Stadsholmen. The first element of this name is, explains the historian Snorri Sturluson (1178–1241), derived from King Agne, a presumably mythological king who in a dim and distant past (around 400 A.D. according to some historians) encamped here after having successfully raided Finland. His intentions were to marry Skjalf, the daughter of the defeated Finnish tribal chief. The young woman, however, tricked him to arrange a celebration including prominent guests which eventually turned into a boozing party, and, while Agne slept sober, Skjalf had him hung in his gold necklace before escaping. A modern story dated back to the mid 17th century, tells how the population of Birka, a historical city on Lake Mälaren, grew too rapidly, and the Gods then consulted urged parts of the population to emigrate to a new site. To determine where to build the new city, it was decided a log bound with gold should point out where to settle by sailing ashore on the site, and, occasionally, it landed on an islet in what is today central Stockholm. According to a 17th-century myth, the tower Birger Jarls torn, often and erroneously said to be the oldest building in Stockholm, was built on this location.Stockholms gatunamn, Namnet Stockholm, p 30-32.  Origin  According to the Chronicle of Eric, written in the 1320s, Stockholm was founded by Birger Jarl around 1250 as a lock to the Lake Mälaren region (laas fore then sio, \\"lock before that lake\\") in order to prevent pirates from reaching the seven cities and nineteen parishes around it. Another medieval source (Visbyannalerna), however, claims the city was founded in 1187 following a pagan pillaged the city of Sigtuna, and as there was an \\"Earl\\" named Birger around at that time too, the disputed origin of the city are likely to remain obscure and some historians choose a diplomatic interpretation saying there was some sort of fortification around by the mouth of Lake Mälaren when the city was founded during the second half of the 13th century. As Snorri mentions no city in his account but some sort of fortification called a kastali (in various manuscripts curiously said to be located east and west of Stocksund), it has generally been assumed this fortification eventually developed into the castle Tre Kronor located where still is the Stockholm Palace.Söderlund, St Erik 2002, pp 27-28 While the reliability of these stories remains disputed, dendrochronological examinations of logs driven into the seabed in Norrström, square oak logs, and sunken logs found on Helgeandsholmen just north of Stadsholmen in 1978-1980, concluded these trees were cut down during the period 970-1020, most of them from around 1010, and these logs presumably gave the entire city its present name, Stock-holm, \\"Log-Islet\\". Anyhow, any hypothesis on the origin of the city necessarily need to depart from three poorly documented defensive structures:Hall, p 23-25 # Some kind of original primitive redoubt surrounded by wooden barriers probably constructed during the Viking era (i.e. around 1000). # A bailey and a larger building located on a pair of islets now part of Helgeandsholmen accompanied by a row of poles forming a barrier in the strait (i.e. the \\"lock\\" of Lake Mälaren). # A castle built on the north- eastern corner of Stadsholmen, a construction probably initiated by Birger Jarl in the mid 13th century and completed around 1300. It is possible the construction of this castle started simultaneously with the second defensive structure mentioned above and that this structure became outdated as the castle was completed. It is often said the keep of the Three Crown Castle originated from at least parts of these defensive structures. As historical and archaeological records are fragmentary, the origin of this tower and the castle remain open for various interpretations, as do the size and extent of the city at the time. Some researchers conclude Stockholm evolved into the Swedish capital and an important trade city before 1200 (Kumlien), while others suggest the location remained a mostly rural area around 1250 to quickly expand into the large city before the castle was completed (Hansson, Ödman).  Origin of the name  The first, verified, mention of the name 'Stockholm' is from two letters written in Latin in 1252; the first, written in July, is a letter where the King Valdemar and Birger Jarl offered their royal patronage to Fogdö Abbey; and the other, written by Birger Jarl in August, urged the peasantry in Attundaland to pay their tithes to the Uppsala Cathedral. Both letters were written in Stockholm, but give no further information of the city itself or any explanation on the background of the name. However, it can be assumed at least some sort of dwelling in consistence with the station of a Swedish jarl existed at that time. While the name itself easily splits into two distinct elements - stokker, or in modern Swedish stock, meaning \\"log\\", and holme, meaning \\"islet\\" - a matter-of-fact explanation for the name is much harder to produce, and over the years many popular myths have, accordingly, attempted to give a background. The first attempt to a more serious explanation was put forward by the German humanist Jacob Ziegler in his work Schondia (Scandinavia) printed in 1532. Writing in Latin, he describes the city as the stronghold and trade post of the Swedes, located among paludibus, meaning either marshes or lakes, and - like Venice - resting on poles. Most likely, while in Rome Ziegler must have come in contact with prominent Swedes like Johannes Magnus who supplied him with the description of the city, which still today styles itself \\"The Venice of the Nordic countries\\" (Nordens Venedig). Other interpretations includes stock being an allusion to: * poles erected either to indicate frontiers or temporary market places, * trap logs used to catch animals, * stubs supposed to have been abundant on the central island of the city, * fiskestock - either the local \\"fish livestock\\" or a hollowed-out log used as an osier basket, * the place where the watercourse and/or logs clogs (stockar sig), * the name Stocksund for the stream flowing through the city, as mentioned in Snorri Sturluson's Ynglinga saga and the saga of Saint Olaf (see below), thus supposing the original name of the city was Stocksundsholm (\\"Log-strait- islet\\"), * a footbridge stretching over the stream, supposedly built before 1000, and, * probably the most widespread explanation, logs drilled into the strait for either defensive purposes, or to force ships to pay tolls. To add to the enigma, Stockholm has been called Eken (\\"The oak\\") in many contexts. While it is mostly associated with slang today, it is supposedly derived from Stockhäcken, the name the city was given by traders from Västergötland (called Västgötaknallar).

His 1979 home demo of the song was released as the B-side of his 1982 hit \\"Someday, Someway\\" and is available on his compilations The 9 Volt Years and This Is Easy: The Best of Marshall Crenshaw. Written by Crenshaw while in Beatlemania, the song was inspired by the Hollies and featured tongue-in-cheek lyrics about his wife. The song, though originally a B-side, would later be covered by many artists, including Owen Paul, who reached number 3 in Britain with his rendition. Original version \\"You're My Favorite Waste of Time\\" was one of the first songs Marshall Crenshaw wrote, preceding his 1982 hit, \\"Someday, Someway\\". Crenshaw explained, \\"That's one that I actually remember writing. I was still in Beatlemania at the time. The show was at the Stanley Theater in Pittsburgh, and we were going to be there for two weeks. I got there a day early and was hanging out, watching the guys build sets. I went down to the room where all the guitars were, and I grabbed one of those Gibson J-160s. The Beatles, in the early days, used J-160 acoustics with P-90 pickups, so we had a couple of those in the show. I was noodling around, and I made that song up in my head as I was wandering around the theater. I got the title, and I was thinking a song that The Hollies might do, with a big anthemic chorus and harmonies and stuff.\\" The lyrics were intended by Crenshaw to be humorous. He explained, \\"The lyrics are tongue-in- cheek. 'You're my favorite waste of time.' It’s a love song. I don’t know what I was thinking of. I guess I was partly thinking about when I used to go over to [my wife] Ione’s house—this was when we were still in our teens—and we’d wait for her parents to go to bed so we could be alone. While we would do that, we were just sitting around watching TV, killing time. I really liked doing that with her, just sort of doing nothing. You could take it a lot of different ways, though. It’s a funny song, and it’s got funny words. Like, 'I don’t care if being with you is meaningless and ridiculous.' That’s a funny thing to say.' Crenshaw recorded \\"You're My Favorite Waste of Time\\" in a homemade sound laboratory in his apartment in Pelham, New York. The song, which was recorded by Crenshaw alone, was credited to \\"Marshall Crenshaw and the Handsome, Ruthless and Stupid Band\\". The song was originally released as the B-side to Crenshaw's hit \\"Someday, Someway.\\" It would later appear on compilation albums and would be covered by numerous artists. Reflecting on the song's popularity among other artists Crenshaw later stated that the song \\"has really had staying power.\\" Cover versions =Owen Paul version= The song was recorded by Scottish singer Owen Paul and released in the United Kingdom on 19 May 1986. It remains his biggest hit single, reaching number 3 on the UK chart in July 1986 and at number 23 in Australia. Paul is usually considered as a \\"one-hit wonder\\" because of the song's popularity and the fact that it was his only UK chart single. This recording features future Thunder member Mark Luckhurst on bass. It was aborted on the television programme Pebble Mill at One when the band members just stood still instead of miming as they were unable to hear the backing track. Referring to the Owen Paul version, Crenshaw said that \\"a guy in Britain picked up on [Bette Midler's] version of it and had his own smash hit, which still gets played on the radio all the time in Europe.\\" Crenshaw was critical of Paul's version in an interview, saying \\"I can't listen to even twenty seconds of that record at all.\\" =Other versions= Australian born Irish singer Johnny Logan recorded the song on his album, We All Need Love (2003). In 2008, the song featured in a Coco Pops Coco Rocks commercial. In 2012, the song featured in an episode of the BBC programme Rogue Traders on Watchdog. The song has also been recorded by Freedy Johnston, Bette Midler, Jeff Foskett, Matthew Sweet and Susanna Hoffs, and Ronnie Spector. Crenshaw said of Bette Midler's version, \\"I guess there must have been something in it that struck her as funny—that appealed to her sense of humor perhaps, whatever that is.\\" References Marshall Crenshaw songs Bette Midler songs Johnny Logan (singer) songs 1986 singles Songs written by Marshall Crenshaw 1979 songs Chrysalis Records singles ","title":"You're My Favorite Waste of Time"},{"id":"16003918","title":"Nallamalupu Bujji"},{"id":"16003922","text":":This page is for the mountain range in British Columbia.
