Football career Early career Born in Lisbon, Costa began his career at S.L. Benfica, also being loaned to C.F. Os Belenenses and Amora F.C. during his formative years. In 2003, he moved to Italy's A.C. Reggiana 1919, but failed to appear in any games in the season's Serie C1/A. Greece In January 2005, Costa joined Superleague Greece club Ionikos FC. Exactly two years later he was loaned to Athlitiki Enosi Larissa FC, which eventually won the domestic cup as the player appeared in one match in the tournament, the 31 January quarter-finals against PAE Kerkyra. During his two-and-a-half-year stay in the country, Costa was voted by fans and league players and coaches for two straight years to the annual All-Star game, held between the best Greek and foreign players. England / Romania On 1 September 2007, Costa signed a one-year contract with Leeds United. He made seven appearances, all but one as a substitute, and was sent off in a rare start, a game against Bury for the Football League Trophy; his injuries otherwise largely prevented him from playing. In mid- January 2008, Costa joined Scottish club Falkirk for a trial, but returned to Elland Road after this proved unsuccessful. He was released in April. For the 2008‚Äì09 campaign, Costa moved to Romania with FC Politehnica Timi»ôoara, with the contract including a special clause that stated it could be terminated if the player suffered an injury. He was released on 4 August 2008. Bulgaria In September 2008, Costa signed for PFC CSKA Sofia. He made his debut for his new team on 4 October against FC Vihren Sandanski, playing a total of five matches during the season. In January of the following year CSKA released the player, via arbitration commission of the Bulgarian Football Union. On 28 January 2009, Costa joined PFC Levski Sofia on a three-year deal. He made his competitive debut also against Vihren, in the first game of the second round of the championship, a 3‚Äì2 win. On 9 May he appeared in The Eternal Derby against ex-team CSKA, with a 2‚Äì0 away win; in total, he contributed with eight appearances for an eventual league win. On 21 June 2009, it was announced that Levski were trying to sell Costa. Club coach Emil Velev decided to sell the player due to his poor performances in the second round of the campaign. Return to Portugal On 13 July 2009, Costa returned to Portugal after six years, joining C.D. Nacional. He was not registered for the season's UEFA Europa League by the Madeirans and, on 5 January 2010, without making any official appearances, he was released, quickly signing with G.D.

It is a national monument. It is the seat of the Bishop of Versailles, created as a constitutional bishopric in 1790 and confirmed by the Concordat of 1801. Interior with pulpit It was built as the parish church of Saint Louis before becoming the cathedral of the new diocese. The building is of the mid-18th century: the first stone was laid, by Louis XV, on 12 June 1743 and the church was consecrated on 24 August 1754. The architect was Jacques Hardouin-Mansart de Sagonne (1711-1778), a grandson of the famous architect Jules Hardouin-Mansart. In 1764 Louis- Fran√ßois Trouard added the Chapelle de la Providence (now the Chapelle des Cat√©chismes) to the northern transept. During the French Revolution it was used as a Temple of Abundance, and badly defaced. It was chosen and used as the cathedral by the post-Revolutionary bishop, who preferred it to the church of Notre-Dame in Versailles, which had been the choice of the preceding constitutional bishop. Its consecration as a cathedral was however severely delayed, and was not performed until 1843, by the diocese's third bishop, Louis-Marie-Edmond Blanquart de Bailleul.

The island lies in the path of the North Atlantic Current, which makes its climate more temperate than would be expected for its latitude just south of the Arctic Circle. This effect is aided by the Irminger Current, which also helps to moderate the island's temperature. The weather in Iceland is notoriously variable. The aurora borealis is often visible at night during the winter. The midnight sun can be experienced in summer on the island of Gr√≠msey off the north coast; the remainder of the country, since it lies just south of the polar circle, experiences a twilight period during which the sun sets briefly, but still has around two weeks of continuous daylight during the summer. Seasons Winter The Icelandic winter is relatively mild for its latitude, owing to maritime influence and proximity to the warm currents of the North Atlantic Gyre. The southerly lowlands of the island average around in winter, while the north averages around . The lowest temperatures in the northern part of the island range from around . The lowest temperature on record is . Summer The average July temperature in the southern part of the island is . Warm summer days can reach . The highest temperature recorded was in the Eastern fjords in 1939. Annual average sunshine hours in Reykjav√≠k are around 1300, which is similar to towns in Scotland and Ireland. Winds and storms Iceland, especially inland and during winter, is frequently subject to abrupt and dramatic changes in weather that can sharply reduce visibility, as well as rapidly increasing wind speed and precipitation, and shift temperature. Generally, wind speeds tend to be higher in the highlands, but topographical features can aggravate winds and cause strong gusts in lowland areas. Wind speed in the lowlands reaches on 10‚Äì20 days per year, but on upwards of 50 days per year in places in the highlands. The strongest measured 10-minute sustained wind speed is and the strongest gust . Heavy dust storms can be generated by strong glacial winds, and can be very strong. Up to of material can be in motion per transect per hour. These storms are very frequent in the early summer in the arid highland areas north of the Vatnaj√∂kull glacier. Thunderstorms are extremely rare for any specific location in Iceland, with fewer than five storms per year in the southern part of the island. They are most common in early or late summer. They can be caused by warm air masses coming up from Europe, or deep lows from the southwest in wintertime. Lightning can usually be observed in connection with ash plumes erupting from the island's volcanoes. Vortices, sometimes on the scale of tornadoes, also occur with volcanic eruptions. Landspouts and waterspouts are occasionally observed. Classic mesocyclone derived tornadoes (i.e. forming from supercells) are very rare, but have been observed. Any of these do occasionally cause damage, although the sparse population further reduces the probability of detection and the hazard. Atmospheric pressure There is a persistent area of low pressure near Iceland known as the Icelandic Low, found between Iceland and Greenland. This area affects the amount of air brought into the Arctic to the east, and the amount coming out of the Arctic to the west. It is part of a greater pressure system known as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).

Virginia is characterized as a \\"bad girl\\" and has been central to a controversial storyline in which she impregnates a fellow female character without their consent. Character development Jennings was cast into the role of Virginia after she auditioned for another part in the program. She was originally contracted to appear in ten episodes of the program. However, after her first day on set, Jennings was offered a three-year contract, which she accepted. In February 1999, it was announced that Sunset Beach had decided to end Jennings' contract with the serial, after they axed Virginia from the series. However, producers decided to not to kill her off and did not rule out a future return. While the character is portrayed as \\"the bitch of the beach\\", Jennings said that Virginia has \\"depth and edge\\" to her. She described her as a single mother from South Central L.A., who is \\"trying to make a better life for her son\\" but making Vanessa and Michael's lives miserable in the process. She opined that Virginia's interest and appeal came through the fact she started out as a completely different character. Jennings also said that there was no other black female portraying such a villainess on daytime television during the nineties. She also had so much fun playing Virginia that she had to remind herself to \\"snap out\\" of character. Virginia is subject to a storyline in which she drugs and impregnates love rival Vanessa Hart (Sherri Saum) with Tyus Robinson's (Russell Curry) sperm, using a turkey baster. In doing so Virginia hopes to win the heart of fellow character Michael Bourne (Jason Winston George). The storyline proved unpopular with some viewers. In another part of the storyline Virginia dresses up as her alter-ego \\"Nurse Jones\\" in an attempt to fool and run Vanessa's stay in the hospital. Jennings was required to wear a padded fat suit and a \\"whacked-out\\" wig. Jennings said \\"It's really old and itchy, and it's hard to tell I have it on with the nurse's uniform, because the costume is so boxy. It's not so much heavy as it is hot. And the wig is just kind of out there.\\" Storylines Virginia is a person that fights for what she wants and she knows how to get it; she is a widow raising her son Jimmy and she relies on the help of Michael, the man that accidentally shot her husband in a gang war, when she learns of Michael developing a relationship with a reporter named Vanessa, she decides to fight for what she claims as hers and she infiltrates Michael's life in order to get rid of her, claiming that her neighborhood isn't safe because of constant robberies, Virginia gets Michael to give her a place to stay at Surf Central, a house where Michael lives with a number of his other friends, Virginia doesn't hide her feelings for Michael in front of Vanessa and she makes it clear that she wants Vanessa gone, when Michael explains that he sees Virginia only as a friend, Virginia refuses to back down and only becomes more keen on breaking up Michael and Vanessa. She follows Michael and Vanessa one day to the cabin where they arranged a private evening and sets the cabin on fire in order to prevent them from making love. After Virginia successfully covering her tracks, she goes on a private New Year's Eve celebration with Michael, Vanessa and the rest of the Surf Central gang, where her life is put at risk when a serial killer is on the loose, Virginia gets a chance to get rid of Vanessa, but instead decides to help her out when they find themselves in harm's way, when they return to Sunset Beach, it appears that Virginia has finally given up on removing Vanessa from her life, but in reality Virginia is only faking a friendship, Virginia realizes that she needs to go to extreme measures to get rid of Vanessa and when she learns that Vanessa's mother is suffering from a rare genetic illness called Martin's Syndrome, she decides to use that info for her benefit, she goes to see a dark magic expert named Mrs. Moreau (Joyce Guy) who helps her make a potion that makes Vanessa believe that she has the illness. Vanessa leaves town in order not to hurt Michael and Virginia finally has her victory ‚Äì that is, until Michael discovers that Vanessa hasn't really left town. Virginia accidentally walks in on Vanessa and her doctor named Tyus in an embrace when they experiment with a drug that could cure Vanessa, and it gives her an idea on how to get rid of Vanessa once-and-for all, however, when the town is hit by an earthquake, Virginia thinks that her son Jimmy died and she is convinced that God is punishing her for her crimes, however, she covers her story, when she learns that Jimmy is alive, she then goes forward with her most evil plot ever ‚Äì impregnating Vanessa with Tyus's sperm which she steals from a local sperm bank, she does so, using, of all things, a turkey baster and then blackmails Dr. Green into changing Vanessa's due date, Michael and Vanessa are finally broken up when Vanessa lies to Michael about who the father of the baby is and Virginia berates Vanessa for lying. Her world comes crumbling down when Michael investigates Dr. Green and overhears Virginia threatening him. Virginia confesses her crimes to Michael and Vanessa before being carted off to a mental institution of the criminally insane. Reception For her portrayal of Virginia, Jennings was nominated for \\"Outstanding Villainess\\" at the 15th annual Soap Opera Digest Awards in February 1999. Kathleen Morgan of the Daily Record said the turkey baster storyline was \\"incredible\\". While the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette included the storyline in their feature list of the most \\"over-the-top\\" in the history of soap opera. They added that \\"sticking it in another woman\\" was the most \\"outrageous\\" plot to ever feature in the genre. However, the storyline proved controversial with some viewers. Candace Havens of the Charleston Gazette-Mail said \\"It is certainly an uncomfortable storyline for viewers. Let's hope it ends soon\\". She also said that through the storyline, Sunset Beach showed how a \\"fledging soap opera\\" does not always \\"stick with what works\\" with viewers. Havens later opined that Virginia was characterized as a \\"bad girl\\". Sally Stone of the Portsmouth Daily Times said that Virginia delivered \\"a nasty Kodak moment\\" when she manipulated pictures of Vanessa and Tyus. Mike Turner of Soap Opera Weekly said that Virginia became the \\"bitch\\" of Sunset Beach. She was described in Upscale magazine as being \\"a lowdown and dirty gurl from da 'hood\\".

In 1922, the original school moved to Caversham Park near Reading, which offered better accommodation. In 1925, The Oratory Preparatory School was established with just four boys, at Rose Hill House, a Georgian- style country house in Emmer Green, less than a mile away from the main school. Its first Headmaster was Father Sebastian Ritchie, and by 1930 its numbers were up to thirty boys.Our History at oratoryprep.co.uk, accessed 10 May 2020 By 1941, the school, based at Caversham Park, was taking boys only between the ages of six and thirteen.The Catholic Who's Who & Yearbook, Vol. 34 (1941), p. 3: ‚Äú There is a separate Preparatory Department where boys are received between the ages of 6 and 13.

Two terms later, the Oratory School re-established itself for senior boys at Woodcote House, and three cottages in Exlade Street were used for classes for a few boys aged about 10 to 13, pending the re- establishment of a Prep School. In 1946 the Oratory Preparatory School re- opened at the Old Ryde, a fine house at Branksome Park, Poole, with 35 boys. The school moved to its current site in 1969, with 60 acres of grounds, amid open countryside and woodland overlooking the Thames Valley, close to Reading. In 1977, a new Pre-Preparatory Department opened, with 21 children, who included girls for the first time. Under headmaster Michael Randell, who took over in 1981, the school developed further and became fully coeducational. The school accepts children of all faiths, but still has close ties with the Roman Catholic church; Vincent Nichols, Archbishop of Westminster, sits on the Board of Governors, and Cardinal Baum was a member until his death in 2015.Staff & Governing Body at oratoryprep.co.uk Pupils are also expected to attend assemblies and weekly services.Spiritual Life at oratoryprep.co.uk The prep school is in South Oxfordshire, England, although it has a Reading postcode, and is within the area of the Oxfordshire County Council Local Education Authority.

The sources about the wife or wives of Sweyn are contradictory (he is also said to have been married to Sigrid the Haughty), and historians have debated the whether she is the polish ≈öwiƒôtos≈Çawa given another name in Norse sources.  Heimskringla  In the 13th century collection of sagas, Heimskringla, Snorri Sturluson tells that Sweyn Forkbeard was captured in an attack on the Jomsvikings, and turned over to Burislav, king of Wendland. As part of their negotiations, it was agreed that Sweyn would marry Gunhild, the daughter of Burislav, while the latter would marry Sweyn's sister Tyri. By Gunhild, Sweyn is said to have had Harald II of Denmark and Cnut the Great. While this account agrees with certain aspects of the historical record, there are also differences. Chroniclers There is scant material in medieval chronicles to provide details regarding the marriages of Sweyn of Denmark: *Thietmar of Merseburg mentions that the daughter of Mieszko I of Poland and sister of Boleslaw I of Poland married Sweyn Forkbeard and gave him sons Cnut and Harold, but he does not mention her name. Thietmar is probably the best informed of all medieval chroniclers, since he was contemporary with described events and well-informed about the events in Poland and Denmark. The assertion that Harald and Cnut's mother was Boleslaw's sister may explain some mysterious statements that appear in medieval chronicles, such as the involvement of Polish troops in invasions of England. *Adam of Bremen writes that a Polish princess was the wife of Eric the Victorious and by this marriage the mother of Olof Sk√∂tkonung of Sweden. In her second marriage with Sweyn, she became mother of Cnut and Harold of Denmark. Consequently, Adam calls Cnut and Olof brothers. Some historians consider Adam's account unreliable, because he is the only source to state this relationship. *Gesta Cnutonis regis mentions in one short passage that Cnut and his brother went to the land of the Slavs, and brought back their mother, who was living there. This does not necessarily mean that his mother was Slavic, but nevertheless this chronicle strongly suggests that she was. *There is an inscription in \\"Liber vitae of the New Minster and Hyde Abbey Winchester\\", that king Cnut's sister's name was \\"Santslaue\\" (\\"Santslaue soror CNVTI regis nostri\\"), which without doubt is a Slavic name. J. Steenstrup suggests that Canute's sister may have been named after her mother, hence coining (the now generally agreed upon) hypothesis, that her Old Polish name is ≈öwiƒôtos≈Çawa, but only as a reconstruction based on a single mention of her daughter's name and the hypothesis that she named her daughter after herself. Identities Several alternative interpretations of these data have been proposed. Gunhild might be identical to the historical wife of Sweyn. Further, the dual marriage reported by Adam of Bremen matches the Heimskringla account of Sigrid the Haughty. This may represent confusion between two wives, or it could be that Sigrid is a confused duplicate memory of the same historical wife. This would mean that the woman called Gunhild in the sagas was Eric's widow, as several historians have concluded.e.g. Lars O. Lagerqvist Kings and Rulers of Sweden p. 10 Finally, it is possible that Gunhild is simply a legendary invention, not directly based on Sweyn's known Polish wife.

The whole body is almost ovoid, the first pereiopods have no claws, and the telson is long, none of which are seen in related groups.

Her publications included A Guide to the Flora of the Cape Peninsula in 1929, and substantial sections of Flora of the Cape Peninsula by Adamson & Salter in 1950. After her retirement in 1945, she remained active in the botanical field and published numerous papers on taxonomy and phytogeography. She revised a number of South African genera e.g. Muraltia. In 1923 she married John Levyns, later Assistant Provincial Secretary of the Cape Province and who served on the council of the Botanical Society of South Africa. Margaret Levyns is commemorated in Thamnochortus levynsiae Pillans, Nivenia levynsiae H. Weimarck and Crassula levynsiae Adamson. Some 12 000 of her collected specimens are lodged with BOL, CT, PRE, K and other herbaria. This botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation Levyns when citing a botanical name.

Located on the sea front, it is the most convenient station for the majority of the town. Ryde Esplanade is also the location of the principal ticket office and all lost property facilities for the Island Line. The larger St John's Road station houses the area office and is next to Ryde depot, where all in-house maintenance for the line takes place.  History  A station has existed on the site since 29 August 1864, when a horse-drawn tram service began operation along the new Ryde Pier. This service, and the line it ran along, pre-dates both the railway line and the current facilities on the site. The tramway was extended to St John's Road in August 1871, but in 1880 this service was replaced by the railway line and current station. The station was originally known as Pier Gate. Trams continued running under various power sources until after the Grouping of Britain's railways in 1923, right up to January 1969. The tram lines and the remaining terminus platforms for them are still visible at the western end of platform 1. Facilities There are two tracks through the station, and therefore two platform faces. The southern platform 1 is used for all regular passenger services, meaning that on departure trains may run in either direction. Platform 2 has previously been used for additional shuttle trains from the Esplanade to the Pier Head, but has fallen into disuse. Part of this second platform was due to be demolished in March 2007 under a separate Network Rail project. Access between the two platforms was by means of a subway. This subway is no longer open to the public and is regularly flooded to a depth of several metres. There is a canopy over platform one, while platform two has a simple shelter over the subway entrance. All passenger facilities, including the ticket office and access to Ryde bus station, are found next to platform one on the south side of the site. Service pattern As of November 2008, there are two trains per hour to all destinations on the line, except Smallbrook Junction which is not always open to passengers. Due to the placement of passing loops on the mainly single- track line, trains cannot currently run at even 30-minute intervals. Instead, in each direction, each hour there is one train followed by a gap of 20 minutes, then another train followed by a gap of 40 minutes. In exceptionally busy periods, 3 trains per hour have previously run at even 20-minute intervals. \\"Clockface\\" 30-minute intervals between departures are expected after upgrade work on the line, scheduled for Winter 2020-2021.

Maney. The slope deflection method was widely used for more than a decade until the moment distribution method was developed. In the book, \\"The Theory and Practice of Modern Framed Structures\\", written by J.B Johnson, C.W. Bryan and F.E. Turneaure, it is stated that this method was first developed,\\"by Professor Otto Mohr in Germany, and later developed independently by Professor G.A. Maney\\". According to this book, professor Otto Mohr introduced this method for the first time in his book,\\"Evaluation of Trusses with Rigid Node Connections\\" or \\"Die Berechnung der Fachwerke mit Starren Knotenverbindungen\\".  Introduction  By forming slope deflection equations and applying joint and shear equilibrium conditions, the rotation angles (or the slope angles) are calculated. Substituting them back into the slope deflection equations, member end moments are readily determined. Deformation of member is due to the bending moment.  Slope deflection equations  The slope deflection equations can also be written using the stiffness factor K=\\\\frac{I_{ab}}{L_{ab}} and the chord rotation \\\\psi =\\\\frac{ \\\\Delta}{L_{ab}}:  Derivation of slope deflection equations  When a simple beam of length L_{ab} and flexural rigidity E_{ab} I_{ab} is loaded at each end with clockwise moments M_{ab} and M_{ba}, member end rotations occur in the same direction. These rotation angles can be calculated using the unit force method or Darcy's Law. :\\\\theta_a - \\\\frac{\\\\Delta}{L_{ab}}= \\\\frac{L_{ab}}{3E_{ab} I_{ab}} M_{ab} - \\\\frac{L_{ab}}{6E_{ab} I_{ab}} M_{ba} :\\\\theta_b - \\\\frac{\\\\Delta}{L_{ab}}= - \\\\frac{L_{ab}}{6E_{ab} I_{ab}} M_{ab} + \\\\frac{L_{ab}}{3E_{ab} I_{ab}} M_{ba} Rearranging these equations, the slope deflection equations are derived.  Equilibrium conditions   Joint equilibrium  Joint equilibrium conditions imply that each joint with a degree of freedom should have no unbalanced moments i.e. be in equilibrium. Therefore, :\\\\Sigma \\\\left( M^{f} + M_{member} \\\\right) = \\\\Sigma M_{joint} Here, M_{member} are the member end moments, M^{f} are the fixed end moments, and M_{joint} are the external moments directly applied at the joint.  Shear equilibrium  When there are chord rotations in a frame, additional equilibrium conditions, namely the shear equilibrium conditions need to be taken into account.  Example  Example The statically indeterminate beam shown in the figure is to be analysed. *Members AB, BC, CD have the same length L = 10 \\\\ m . *Flexural rigidities are EI, 2EI, EI respectively. *Concentrated load of magnitude P = 10 \\\\ kN acts at a distance a = 3 \\\\ m from the support A. *Uniform load of intensity q = 1 \\\\ kN/m acts on BC. *Member CD is loaded at its midspan with a concentrated load of magnitude P = 10 \\\\ kN . In the following calculations, clockwise moments and rotations are positive.  Degrees of freedom  Rotation angles \\\\theta_A, \\\\theta_B, \\\\theta_C, of joints A, B, C, respectively are taken as the unknowns. There are no chord rotations due to other causes including support settlement.  Fixed end moments  Fixed end moments are: :M _{AB} ^f = - \\\\frac{P a b^2 }{L ^2} = - \\\\frac{10 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 7^2}{10^2} = -14.7 \\\\mathrm{\\\\,kN \\\\,m} :M _{BA} ^f = \\\\frac{P a^2 b}{L^2} = \\\\frac{10 \\\\times 3^2 \\\\times 7}{10^2} = 6.3 \\\\mathrm{\\\\,kN \\\\,m} :M _{BC} ^f = - \\\\frac{qL^2}{12} = - \\\\frac{1 \\\\times 10^2}{12} = - 8.333 \\\\mathrm{\\\\,kN \\\\,m} :M _{CB} ^f = \\\\frac{qL^2}{12} = \\\\frac{1 \\\\times 10^2}{12} = 8.333 \\\\mathrm{\\\\,kN \\\\,m} :M _{CD} ^f = - \\\\frac{PL}{8} = - \\\\frac{10 \\\\times 10}{8} = -12.5 \\\\mathrm{\\\\,kN \\\\,m} :M _{DC} ^f = \\\\frac{PL}{8} = \\\\frac{10 \\\\times 10}{8} = 12.5 \\\\mathrm{\\\\,kN \\\\,m}  Slope deflection equations  The slope deflection equations are constructed as follows: :M_{AB} = \\\\frac{EI}{L} \\\\left( 4 \\\\theta_A + 2 \\\\theta_B \\\\right) = \\\\frac{4EI \\\\theta_A + 2EI \\\\theta_B}{L} :M_{BA} = \\\\frac{EI}{L} \\\\left( 2 \\\\theta_A + 4 \\\\theta_B \\\\right) = \\\\frac{2EI \\\\theta_A + 4EI \\\\theta_B}{L} :M_{BC} = \\\\frac{2EI}{L} \\\\left( 4 \\\\theta_B + 2 \\\\theta_C \\\\right) = \\\\frac{8EI \\\\theta_B + 4EI \\\\theta_C}{L} :M_{CB} = \\\\frac{2EI}{L} \\\\left( 2 \\\\theta_B + 4 \\\\theta_C \\\\right) = \\\\frac{4EI \\\\theta_B + 8EI \\\\theta_C}{L} :M_{CD} = \\\\frac{EI}{L} \\\\left( 'Italic text'4 \\\\theta_C \\\\right) = \\\\frac{4EI\\\\theta_C}{L} :M_{DC} = \\\\frac{EI}{L} \\\\left( 2 \\\\theta_C \\\\right) = \\\\frac{2EI\\\\theta_C}{L}  Joint equilibrium equations  Joints A, B, C should suffice the equilibrium condition. Therefore :\\\\Sigma M_A = M_{AB} + M_{AB}^f = 0.4EI \\\\theta_A + 0.2EI \\\\theta_B - 14.7 = 0 :\\\\Sigma M_B = M_{BA} + M_{BA}^f + M_{BC} + M_{BC}^f = 0.2EI \\\\theta_A + 1.2EI \\\\theta_B + 0.4EI \\\\theta_C - 2.033 = 0 :\\\\Sigma M_C = M_{CB} + M_{CB}^f + M_{CD} + M_{CD}^f = 0.4EI \\\\theta_B + 1.2EI \\\\theta_C - 4.167 = 0  Rotation angles  The rotation angles are calculated from simultaneous equations above. :\\\\theta_A = \\\\frac{40.219}{EI} :\\\\theta_B = \\\\frac{-6.937}{EI} :\\\\theta_C = \\\\frac{5.785}{EI}  Member end moments  Substitution of these values back into the slope deflection equations yields the member end moments (in kNm): :M_{AB} = 0.4 \\\\times 40.219 + 0.2 \\\\times \\\\left( -6.937 \\\\right) - 14.7 = 0 :M_{BA} = 0.2 \\\\times 40.219 + 0.4 \\\\times \\\\left( -6.937 \\\\right) + 6.3 = 11.57 :M_{BC} = 0.8 \\\\times \\\\left( -6.937 \\\\right) + 0.4 \\\\times 5.785 - 8.333 = -11.57 :M_{CB} = 0.4 \\\\times \\\\left( -6.937 \\\\right) + 0.8 \\\\times 5.785 + 8.333 = 10.19 :M_{CD} = 0.4 \\\\times -5.785 - 12.5 = -10.19 :M_{DC} = 0.2 \\\\times -5.785 + 12.5 = 13.66  See also  *Beam theory  Notes   References   * Category:Structural analysis ","title":"Slope deflection method"},{"id":"13047081","text":"Samuel Gledhill (7 July 1913 ‚Äì December 1994) was an English footballer.

It is book four in a series known as the Kent Family Chronicles or the American Bicentennial Series. The novel mixes fictional characters with historical events and figures, to tell the story of the United States of America from 1836 to 1852. Plot summary The story begins in March 1836, during the Battle of the Alamo, twenty-two years after the event depicted at the end of The Seekers, book three of the series. Amanda Kent, daughter of Gilbert Kent and Harriet Lebow, was among the women and children who survived the ensuing massacre. After the massacre, she was taken before Santa Anna, who led the Mexican forces against the Texans. He was willing to grant her clemency, an offer she declined, putting her life in danger. She was saved by Major Luis Cordoba, one of Santa Anna's officers, who did not fully support him. Cordoba put Amanda to work as his servant and they eventually fell in love. She remained a camp follower with the Mexican army until April 21, when she witnessed the Battle of San Jacinto, during which Cordoba was killed. Amanda gave birth to his son in January 1837, and named him Louis in his honor. After the Texas rebellion, Amanda left Texas and settled in San Francisco, which at the time was called Yerba Buena. There she founded a small but profitable tavern. She fell in love with Barton McGill, a sea captain, who made regular trips from California to New York City, and through him she discovered that a publishing firm called Kent and Son still operated. The firm was once owned by her father, but had been lost in a game of cards by her stepfather to Hamilton Stovall. McGill told her that Stovall still owned it and from that moment on, Amanda became obsessed with buying it back from him. The California Gold Rush, in part, provided her the means. She found out through McGill that her cousin Jared Kent, believed to be dead, was in fact still alive. When the Gold Rush began, Amanda expanded her tavern into a hotel and because so many came seeking gold, the establishment made her a great deal of money. Jared Kent, Amanda's cousin, was one of many men who came to California in search of gold. He and two partners found a profitable gold claim involving a mine called the Ophir. Amanda had not seen her cousin in thirty-four years, but they were unexpectedly reunited for a brief time during Christmas 1849. During the short-lived reunion, Jared gave a brief account of his life since 1814, i.e., after the end of the Seekers, and revealed that he now had a son, Jephtha, and three grandsons (plus a granddaughter, Annabelle, who died in infancy). Jared would have preferred that his son stay with him in the west, but Jephtha moved to Lexington, Virginia and became a Methodist minister. He also discussed his gold-mining venture. Jared was enraged to learn from Amanda that he had not killed Walpole before fleeing Boston in 1813, which is what he had believed until then. Men who were opposed to American immigrants attempted to kill Amanda in retaliation for the death of one of their kind, a bigoted bartender called Felker, that had occurred earlier. The incident brought the two cousins together. The killers fired into Amanda's home and mortally injured Jared. In his dying moments after being shot, he revealed the name of Gilbert Kent's attorney, William Benbow, to Amanda. Amanda replaced Jared as the third partner to his gold claim and with that financial backing, she returned to Boston to reclaim the Kent and Son publishing firm. After meeting Benbow and then banker Joshua Rothman, she discovered that, unbeknownst to her mother, her father had invested in a textile company late in his life. This investment made her a millionaire and, with this money, she attempted to buy Kent and Son. Amanda used her married name, de la Gura, because of Stovall's rivalry with the Kent family, but when she incautiously made it known that she wanted to publish more liberal leaning literature, Stovall rescinded the offer. This did not deter her from her goal. She proceeded to buy stocks in Kent and Son in an attempt to become the majority shareholder. Though he lived in a southern state, Jephtha became morally opposed to slavery and he became a conductor on the Underground Railroad. In 1852, he mailed a female slave belonging to his father-in-law, Virgil Tunworth, in a wooden box to Amanda in New York City, where she was now living, and she inadvertently also became a conductor. While she was opposed to the Fugitive Slave Act, she had previously believed it should be obeyed simply because it was the law of the land, but she aided her cousin. When Jephtha's father-in-law came to Amanda's house in search of his slave, Amanda kept her hidden. Then, after he left, she sneaked the runaway out of her house disguised as another woman who was visiting Amanda. This event was published in the newspapers and it inadvertently revealed Amanda as Jephtha's cousin. When Stovall read the article, he blocked Amanda from ever gaining a majority of the stocks in Kent and Son. He then called on her and said that he intended to ruin her life and the life of her son, and to take legal action that would prevent Amanda from ever buying Kent and Son. During their conversation, an Irish gang attacked Amanda's home (in retaliation for Louis' raping an Irish maid in Amanda's employ and Amanda's subsequent sacking of the maid). As Stovall fled, he knocked Louis unconscious with his cane. Thinking that her son had been killed, Amanda shot Stovall dead. However, in that same raid, one of the gang members shot Amanda and mortally wounded her. She lived seventeen days afterwards, long enough to discover that Stovall's heirs were willing to sell Kent and Son to the Kent family, and to arrange to have the purchase made.

The new space was small and inclement weather prevented taping. Noise ordinances prevented playing loud music while taping outdoors, so the show had to be taped without music and dubbed in later. Other installments went to Zuma Beach in California, Brooklyn, Miami and Hawaii. Nies was replaced in 1995 by various guest hosts.

Webb was initially well known for his appearances on Channel NWS-9 in Adelaide in the 1970s. He later became a Christian, and eventually a pastor and the South Australian state leader for the Apostolic Church Australia.  Background  Webb and his brother Keith Webb had a passion for music at a young age, which led them to their appearances and performances on local television channel NWS-9 in Adelaide. The Webb brothers initially received the \\"Encouragement Award\\" alongside Faye Nelson and Deborah Kirk on SAS 10's New Faces in 1971. This was a unique event, as it was the first occasion that three acts had received the award in the same show.TV Guide (SA's Fully Independent TV, Radio and Theatre Review) - 4‚Äì10 December Edition 1971 The Webb brothers later went on to win the grand final of the series, and became guest presenters on numerous TV Telethons, a popular form of raising funds for charity in the 1970s. They also appeared regularly on NWS 9's Stars of Tomorrow and were popular guests on Ernie Sigley's Adelaide Tonight in the 1970s. In particular, they became teen hosts on Adelaide's version of the popular television show Hey Hey It's Saturday in 1973.NWS-9 (Channel Nine, Adelaide, Archives) http://www.nws9.com.au However, Hey Hey It's Saturday only lasted a single season before the format was changed, and within a few years the Melbourne show hosted by Daryl Sommers was syndicated throughout the Nine Network Australia Wide. The Webb brothers appeared alongside the likes of Lisa Edwards who later went on to be one of John Farnham's backing singers. In addition, the Webb brothers performed as one of the support acts for Farnham during an Australia Day concert at Memorial Drive in 1973. Their performances also included a number of \\"live\\" appearances on local radio stations. The Webb brothers formed the band Web in the late 1970s, performing at various Adelaide venues, eventually recording a number of their original songs at the ABC studios in Collinswood, showcasing their talent on ABC radio.ABC Radio South Australia Archives Webb went on to play in numerous bands and cover acts in the Adelaide area including Stiletto, the Michael Hunter Band, No Moving Parts and The Works. He currently plays solo gigs in the Adelaide area at weddings, in hotels and wineries and private parties on a part-time basis. https://www.facebook.com/MusicianMichaelJWebb/ Marriage and children Webb married Chrys (Christine Ann Webb) in 1976 and had their first child Lauren in 1979. Webb's love of music led him to name their first son, Marc, born in November 1980, after T-Rex front man Marc Bolan. They later had their second son Luke in 1985. Conversion to Christianity Webb and his brother Keith (who had since moved to Queensland) eventually began working on a Rock Opera based on the prophecies of Nostradamus. It was during research for this project that Webb first became a Christian, initially worshiping at the Noarlunga Corps Salvation Army in Morphett Vale. Webb and his family moved to Berri, South Australia in 1994, where they started a small home fellowship group that eventually became Riverland Shekinah, and in a later name change, Riverland Central Christian Church, a member of the Apostolic Church in Australia. It was here that Webb once again began singing and playing guitar as both Pastor and worship leader for the church. Later, Webb was officially ordained as a minister of religion in the Apostolic Church. The church initially met in Berri but eventually moved to Glossop, South Australia.Riverland Central Website - http://www.rccc.riverland.net.au After his time in Riverland Central, Webb became the National Church Planting Director for the Apostolic Church, which included the beginning of churches across Australia. This included a church plant in Gerard, an Australian Aboriginal mission in South Australia, and a church and orphanage in Kerala India.Impact Magazine Webb later passed on the role for \\"church planter\\" to become the state leader of the Apostolic Church for South Australia and the Northern Territory.Apostolic Church Australia Website - http://www.apostolic.org.au In 2006, Webb and his wife Chrys returned to Adelaide to take over Gateway Community Church in Morphett Vale, but remained the Senior Pastors for Riverland Central until the leadership was passed on to Pastors David and Joella Crossfield in January 2007.Gateway Community Church Website - http://www.gatewaycc.org.au External links * http://www.apostolic.org.au * http://www.gatewaycc.org.au  References  Category:English Pentecostals Category:Australian Pentecostals Category:Australian television presenters Category:Living people Category:1956 births ","title":"Mike Webb (pastor)"},{"id":"13047183","text":"Filippo Sc√≤zzari (Bologna, 1946), is an Italian comics artist, painter and writer, one of the main figures of the 1970s underground art movement. Known for his first comic at Mondadori's Il Mago under the pen name Winslow Leech, he worked for Re Nudo and Il Mago, Radio Alice of Bologna, Cannibale, Il Male, Frigidaire, Blue, Panorama, TV Sorrisi e Canzoni and Glamour International. Career His career began in the 1970s, appearing in various underground satirical publications; in 1979 he collaborated with the satirical weekly publication Il Male, and in the subsequent years he was published in Fri'Zzer, Tempi Supplementari, Il Luned√¨ della Repubblica and was among the founders of the comic magazines Cannibale and Frigidaire. During the same years he also appeared in Re Nudo, Linus, Vogue, Spaceships Today, Panorama, and Alteralter. His comics have been published in France, Brazil and Greece. Most of his comics has been collected in eight books published in Italy by Primo Carnera Editore and Coniglio Editore, in France by Albin Michel, in Brazil by Conrad Editora. He wrote six novels, an anthology of his best New P-Porno tales and a theatrical work, Heart in Slices. He held several exhibitions in Italy: in Rimini, in Montecchio Emilia, in Rome, in Reggio Emilia, in Milan, in Turin, in Bologna and, abroad, in Athens. Among his comic books are: a graphic novel based on Raymond Chandler's screenplay The Blue Dahlia (La Dalia Azzurra, 1981), a collection of stories from his underground period (Doctor Jack, 1982), a collection of his early science fiction short stories (Mud and Oxygen, 1992) and various collections of the comics formerly published in FRIGIDAIRE magazine (Women, 1987, Sister Big Tooth & others Battles, 1992). Very interesting his last sci-fi cartoons anthology \\"LASSU' NO\\" (UP THERE, NO): \\"Thousands of details, of flesh and bolts, and then male, clerks, yawns, shady landings and ruthless assassins. Dirty worlds, mud balls, opalescent palaces like extra-luxury rocket hoods. Crazy colors, off the spectrum of bourgeois decency. All this and much more are the comics of Filippo Sc√≤zzari, if you look at them, but if you had to risk reading them you would be invaded like the Earth by aliens. The language of Flip La Fol√¨ (one of the many adorable pseudonyms) is the most untold and unmatched in the world comic, intricate literary construction but plausible spoken of its irregular protagonists, often equated to the prose of Thomas Landolfi for the pleasure and freedom of invention and for the sadistic mastery of stress the syntax until it is incandescent, steaming, one step away from the disintegration of the gears. Sc√≤zzariano is said when someone tries to play hard with words and their sequence, sc√≤zzarian is who, like me, finds himself delivered a narrative Ferrari accustomed as it was to read only utilitarians, at the maximum of Citroen. This book is the account of a climb, a book-binoculars that makes us enjoy one of the most daring comic shows ever, a peak unattainable by nature, by magic, by choice. The world is full of summits to aim for, where your sherpa can lead you. Equipped with everything, you can go anywhere. But where Sc√≤zzari went, no, not up there.\\" (Ratigher) Works * Primo Carnera, cartoons, Roma, Primo Carnera Editore, 1982 * La dalia azzurra, cartoons, Roma, Primo Carnera Editore, 1982 [Ristampa Coniglio Editore 2006 e Editoriale Cosmo 2017] * Dottor Jack, cartoons, Roma, Primo Carnera Editore, 1983 * Donne (odori, nei, peli e altri fantasmi), cartoons, Roma, Primo Carnera Editore, 1985 * Suor Dentona (e altre battaglie), cartoons, Roma, Primo Carnera Editore, 1988 [Integral edition Mompracem, 2012] * Fango e ossigeno, cartoons, Roma, Primo Carnera Editore, 1988 * Altri cieli, Roma, sci-fi cartoons, Primo Carnera Editore, 1992 * Cuore di Edmondo, theatrical text, Bologna, Granata Press, 1993 * XXXX!

He also wrote for radio, television and film. Biography Shortly before World War I, Mather's family emigrated to Australia, where he received his education. He studied medicine, the family profession at Sydney University.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-berkely- mather-1305029.html Finding himself in England without prospects at the height of the Great Depression, he enlisted in the Royal Horse Artillery, but failed to gain a commission. He therefore applied to join the Indian Army, in which he rose through the ranks, becoming a sergeant at the outbreak of World War II in 1939. He served in the Iraq campaign under Slim, and ended the war as an acting lieutenant-colonel. After India gained independence in 1947, he rejoined the British Army, serving in the Royal Artillery until he retired in 1959.Jack Adrian, \\"Obituary: Berkely Mather\\", The Independent, 15 April 1996. Mather's first novel, The Achilles Affair (1959), was a minor best-seller, and his second, The Pass Beyond Kashmir (1960), which received glowing reviews from Ian Fleming and Erle Stanley Gardner,The Pass beyond Kashmir did even better. Ernest Hemingway owned copies of both these novels.Hemingway's Library Mather's espionage thrillers can be read separately, but are linked to each other by recurring characters, in particular the sardonic and resourceful British agent Idwal Rees, who appears in The Pass Beyond Kashmir, The Terminators and Snowline. The author's military experience and years spent abroad give his work richness and depth.Classic Crime Fiction His last three novels were an ambitious trilogy that followed the fortunes of the Stafford family in the Near and Far East from the middle of the nineteenth century to the middle of the twentieth. Two of Mather's early books stand somewhat apart from the rest in that they are spin-offs from his work in other media. Geth Straker (1962) started out as a radio serial, hence the tag on the front cover: \\"Further daring exploits from the log of radio's trouble hunting mariner\\". The book contains four stories. Genghis Khan (1965) is a novelisation of the 1965 film of the same name, for which he had written the original story. Mather's other motion picture credits include The Long Ships and Dr. No with Mather borrowing a copy of Fleming's original novel from his son.

It has gained notoriety in Australia's National Rugby League competition whereby the tackler attempts to impede the ball carrier by applying a chokehold-like grip. Although players can be penalised for its use, it is difficult to enforce. Mechanics A grapple tackle has two distinct variations, both of which are illegal under the laws of the game. Note that a simple chokehold or headlock is tolerated within the game. *Type A (a true grapple tackle) involves a defender, usually the third to arrive, applying pressure to the attacking player's neck with the bony part of his forearms. He then proceeds to 'untwist' his arms in order to twist the players neck. The idea is to prevent the attacker from falling onto his stomach from where he can quickly play the ball. Instead, he must turn with the player twisting his neck onto his back. The third defender, now with the attacker's 'backhead' in his stomach and still with his arms placed around the player's neck, then puts his entire weight onto the player's head by shifting his weight off his legs. This enables the previous defenders considerable time to retreat the 10m; because of the pressure on the neck the attacker is 'stunned'. A prolonged hold of this sort can cause disorientation and even unconsciousness. *Type B (more common but less effective) involves only two players. The first defender makes a traditional 'ball-and-all' tackle, locking the ball up. The second defender then tries to put all of his weight into twisting the attacking player onto his back. Sometimes, it involves using a 'chokehold' where one arm is wrapped around the throat. However, this technique has been used in rugby league for years, and is not a true grapple tackle. It only becomes a problem when a player uses the 'crushing' aspect outlined above, where he puts all of his weight onto the back of the attacker's head/neck. This tackle is usually ignored by most referees, because it happens far more quickly, and most attackers actually contribute to their own demise by looking to offload the ball.

Megumi Satsu (Ëñ© „ÇÅ„Åê„Åø) Megumi Satsu released a few singles in Japan early in her career and then moved to France at the end of the seventies. She was discovered by Jacques Prevert who wrote an album of new songs especially for her. Some additional albums were recorded in the following years with the collaboration of some of the most famous French writers; Roland Topor, Jean Baudrillard, William Cliff and Fr√©d√©ric Mitterrand (who was the Minister of Culture in France under Nicolas Sarkozy's presidency). These recordings were released in collaboration with famous musicians like Serge Perathoner or Patrick Vasori, to name just a few. With her alternative repertoire, her expressionist interpretation and her charismatic personality, M√©gumi became the icon of an alternative underground generation and the muse of modists who saw in her the new Marlene Dietrich with an Asian touch. She had the opportunity to sing some French poems written by the famous writer and poet Jacques Pr√©vert. Just a few years before dying, Pr√©vert saw Satsu on TV; he was fascinated by her voice and her personality. He told his wife that Satsu would be perfect for interpreting some of his unedited texts. Pr√©vert's wife contacted Megumi Satsu after her husband died and she took on the project. Megumi Satsu was a friend of Jean Baudrillard, the famous French sociologist. He also wrote two songs for her, \\"Motel Suicide\\" and \\"Lifting Zodiacal\\". Roland Topor was captivated too by this \\"lady in black\\" wearing strange hats. She knows how to use her mysterious look. He wrote two songs, \\"Monte dans mon Ambulance\\" et \\"Je m'aime\\". Megumi Satsu mostly performed in French, though she did record some songs in Japanese and English. Megumi Satsu was also inspired by the 1930s, such as interpreting Bertold Brecht in French.

The general public knew little about Belle Stewart until 2006, when her daughter, Sheila Stewart, wrote the biography Queen Amang the Heather: the Life of Belle Stewart. Sheila Stewart corrects the frequently cited birthdate 17 July to the 18th. Early years Belle McGregor was born on the banks of the River Tay at Caputh, near Blairgowrie, into a family of Highland Scottish Travellers, who lived in bow-tents (similar to dome tents). As a result of their life-style, the whole family received much insult and abuse. Belle's father died when she was only 9 months old. Afraid that social workers might take her children from her, her mother stopped travelling and settled in Perthshire. The McGregor family tried to teach Belle how to read palms (fortune telling), but she didn't take to this. The family frequently went to Northern Ireland to do pearl-fishing. In the evenings they would gather at ceilidhs to exchange folk songs. Marriage Belle's version of \\"If I Was a Blackbird\\" inspired Alex Stewart, a violin player, to propose to her. They married in secret on 17 August 1925 at Ballymoney in Northern Ireland. As married second cousins, they for a time had fears that this would affect the health of their children, but such fears proved unfounded. Belle married into a rich heritage. Alex's father Jock Stewart (1869‚Äì1954) had become a champion violinist, supposedly the subject of the popular Scots and Irish drinking-song \\"Jock Stewart, A Man You Don't Meet Every Day\\" recorded by The Dubliners and The Pogues among others. Jock's father, \\"Big Jimmy\\" Stewart, also a champion violinist, allegedly died when beaten to death by a group of Irishmen he met on his way home from busking in the Pitlochry area ‚Äì because he refused to play a tune they requested. Alex's mother, Nancy Campbell, reputedly had both a grandfather (Andy Campbell) and a grandmother sentenced to death by hanging in the 18th century for the crime of travelling. For a few months Belle suffered from Bell's palsy. Alex left her and returned to Ireland. After treatment she made a complete recovery, and Alex returned to her. On 7 July 1935 Bell gave birth to Sheila. Belle also had another daughter, Cathie, and two sons, Andy and John. The family made their living by selling scrap metal and by pearl fishing. The government conscripted Alex Stewart into the military. His Captain also came from Blairgowrie. The Captain was wounded in action and Alex carried him to the Red Cross camp. When the Captain learned who had saved his life, he said that he would have preferred to die rather than to owe his life to a \\"Tink\\". Alex and his wife wrote letters in the Traveller cant known as Beurla-reagaird. The British Army postal censors could not understand it, and ordered them to stop. In 1952 Alex and Belle paid a builder to build them a house.  Cultural milieu  The Scottish Travellers referred to palm-reading as \\"drookerin\\" in cant, and labelled a non-traveller as a \\"naken\\". When the Stewarts of Blairgowrie went to the Sidmouth Festival (founded in 1955) in Devon they encountered \\"New Age travellers\\" for the first time, selling jewellery. Belle Stewart noticed how dirty the New Agers were. They labelled themselves as travellers but Belle replied \\"No, you're not. We are.\\" The New Age Travellers said \\"But you're dressed too fine to be travellers.\\" The photographs in Sheila Stewart's book show how much care the Stewarts took with personal appearance. At festivals the whole family would wear tartan kilts and the pipers among them wore full regalia. Belle's repertoire of folk tales frequently refer to the supernatural, including changelings. A collection of her stories appeared in print as \\"The King o' the Black Art\\" in 1987. When Alex Stewart died, the Church of Scotland minister at Blairgowrie refused to allow a funeral service in his church, because Alex had been a Traveller. A Dundee minister phoned them and offered them a service in his church.  Celebrity  While John Stewart worked on a building site in Hatfield, a friend of Ewan MacColl visited. The following week Ewan MacColl visited the Stewart family. Soon the younger members of the family made recordings of ballads in London. A few months later the whole family received invitations to perform at MacColl's \\"Singers' Club\\" in London. In March 1954 Hamish Henderson invited the Traveller family to do a concert in Edinburgh alongside \\"Auld Galoot\\" (Davie Stewart), Jeannie Robertson and Jimmy MacBeath. Later in 1954 Douglas Kennedy and Peter Kennedy visited them and made recordings. So began their career performing in folk clubs: there the people treated them with respect, unlike the rest of urban society. Her most famous composition is \\"The Berry Fields o' Blair\\". In 1966 Peter Shepherd and Jimmy Hutchinson started the Blair Folk Festival. Sheila Stewart won the singing competition with \\"The Twa Brothers\\". After 1969 the annual festival relocated to Kinross. Later in the 1960s Alex Stewart made his living in the summer months by playing bagpipes to tourists in Glen Coe and Oban. Belle knew all the songs and decided which of the other members of the family could sing which songs. Ian Stewart became a bagpiper like his father. Belle Stewart became a recipient of the British Empire Medal in 1981. (Her daughter Sheila later received an MBE.) \\"The Overgate\\", a folksong with some similarities to \\"Seventeen Come Sunday\\" has particular associations with the Robertson/ Higgins/ Stewart family of Travellers. Belle recorded it in 1976. In 1965 the family recorded an album called \\"The Stewarts of Blair\\", which the Scottish folk scene took to its heart. In 1975 another Scottish Traveller, Jeannie Robertson, released an album called The Queen Among the Heather, a compilation of tracks from 1953 onwards. In 1976 Belle Stewart released an album with an almost identical title \\"Queen Among the Heather\\". A certain rivalry existed between the two. Alan Lomax preferred Robertson's singing, and Sheila, semi- apologetically, agrees with him in her biography. In about 1970 the family spent a month performing in America. They made several appearances at the Edinburgh Folk Festival and in folk clubs around the UK. Ewan MacColl featured them in a Radio Ballad. Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger also compiled a collection of the folklore of Belle and other members of her family, called 'Till Doomsday in the Afternoon. After the death of Alex they continued to tour, and appeared at a folk festival in Bologna in 1980 and at Lake Como in 1980, with Ian taking the place of chief piper. Belle Stewart died aged 91 in 1997, and hundreds of people attended her funeral.

Lasting for approximately 1,700 years, it was preceded by the era of Neolithic Britain and was in turn followed by the period of Iron Age Britain. Being categorised as the Bronze Age, it was marked by the use of copper and then bronze by the prehistoric Britons, who used such metals to fashion tools. Great Britain in the Bronze Age also saw the widespread adoption of agriculture. During the British Bronze Age, large megalithic monuments similar to those from the Late Neolithic continued to be constructed or modified, including such sites as Avebury, Stonehenge, Silbury Hill and Must Farm. This has been described as a time \\"when elaborate ceremonial practices emerged among some communities of subsistence agriculturalists of western Europe\\".Barrett 1994. p. 05. History Early Bronze Age (EBA), c. 2500‚Äì1500 BC There is no clear consensus on the date for the beginning of the Bronze Age in Great Britain and Ireland. Some sources give a date as late as 2000 BC,Bradley, Prehistory of Britain and Ireland, p. 183. while others set 2200 BC as the demarcation between the Neolithic and the Bronze Age.Pollard, \\"Construction of Prehistoric Britain\\", in Pollard (ed.), Prehistoric Britain, p. 9. The period from 2500 BC to 2000 BC has been called the \\"Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age\\", in recognition of the difficulty of exactly defining this boundary.Prior, Britain BC, p. 226. Some archaeologists recognise a British Chalcolithic when copper was used between the 25th and 22nd centuries BC, but others do not because production and use was on a small scale.Miles, The Tale of the Axe, pp. 363, 423, n. 15 *2500‚Äì2000 BC: Mount Pleasant Phase, Early Beaker culture: copper+tin. *2100‚Äì1900 BC: Late Beaker: knives, tanged spearheads (Bush Barrow; Overton Period). *1800‚Äì1600 BC: Fargo Phase (see correction at Bedd Branwen Period); burials.

In Ireland the final Dowris phase of the Late Bronze Age appears to decline in about 600 BC, but iron metallurgy does not appear until about 550 BC. Development The Beaker cultures Extent of the Beaker culture In around 2000 BC, a new pottery style arrived in Great Britain: the Beaker culture. Beaker pottery appears in the Mount Pleasant Phase (2700‚Äì2000 BC), along with flat axes and the burial practice of inhumation. People of this period were also responsible for building Seahenge along with the later phases of Stonehenge. Movement of Europeans brought new people to the islands from the continent. Recent tooth enamel isotope research on bodies found in early Bronze Age graves around Stonehenge indicates that at least some of the new arrivals came from the area of modern Switzerland. The Beaker culture displayed different behaviours from the earlier Neolithic people and cultural change was significant. Integration is thought to have been peaceful, as many of the early henge sites were seemingly adopted by the newcomers. Also, the burial of dead (which until this period had usually been communal) became more individual. For example, in the Neolithic era, a large chambered cairn or long barrow was used to house the dead. The 'Early Bronze Age' saw people buried in individual barrows (also commonly known and marked on modern British Ordnance Survey maps as tumuli), or sometimes in cists covered with cairns. They were often buried with a beaker alongside the body. There has been debate amongst archaeologists as to whether the \\"Beaker people\\" were a race of people who migrated to Britain en masse from the continent, or whether a Beaker cultural \\"package\\" of goods and behaviour (which eventually spread across most of Western Europe) diffused to Britain's existing inhabitants through trade across tribal boundaries. The former seems incontestable now since a 2017 study showed a major genetic shift in late Neolithic/early Bronze Age Britain, so that more than 90% of Britain's Neolithic gene pool was replaced with the coming of a people genetically similar to the Beaker people of the lower-Rhine area. Bronze The Mold Cape is unique among survivals The massive bronze Oxborough Dirk is too large to use Several regions of origin have been postulated for the Beaker culture, notably the Iberian peninsula, the Netherlands and Central Europe. Part of the Beaker culture brought the skill of refining metal to Great Britain. At first they made items from copper, but from around 2150 BC smiths had discovered how to make bronze (which is much harder than copper) by mixing copper with a small amount of tin. With this discovery, the Bronze Age began in Great Britain. Over the next thousand years, bronze gradually replaced stone as the main material for tool and weapon making. The bronze axehead, made by casting, was at first similar to its stone predecessors but then developed a socket for the wooden handle to fit into, and a small loop or ring to make lashing the two together easier. Groups of unused axes are often found together, suggesting ritual deposits to some, though many archaeologists believe that elite groups collected bronze items, perhaps restricting their use among the wider population. Bronze swords of a graceful \\"leaf\\" shape, swelling gently from the handle before coming to a tip, have been found in considerable numbers, along with spear heads and arrow points. Great Britain had large reserves of tin in the areas of Cornwall and Devon in what is now Southwest England, and thus tin mining began. By around 1600 BC, the southwest of the island was experiencing a trade boom as British tin was exported across Europe. Bronze-age Britons were also skilled at making jewellery from gold, as well as occasional objects like the Rillaton Cup and Mold Cape. Many examples of these have been found in graves of the wealthy Wessex culture of Southern Britain, though they are not as frequent as Irish finds. The greatest quantities of bronze objects found in what is now England were discovered in East Cambridgeshire, where the most important finds were recovered in Isleham (more than 6500 pieces).Hall and Coles, p. 81-88. The earliest known metalworking building was found at Sigwells, Somerset, England. Several casting mould fragments were fitted to a Wilburton type sword held in Somerset County Museum. They were found in association with cereal grain dated to the 12th century BC by carbon dating. The Wessex culture The rich Wessex culture developed in southern Great Britain at this time. The weather, previously warm and dry, became much wetter as the Bronze Age continued, forcing the population away from easily defended sites in the hills and into the fertile valleys. Large livestock farms developed in the lowlands which appear to have contributed to economic growth and inspired increasing forest clearances. The Deverel-Rimbury culture The Deverel-Rimbury culture began to emerge in the second half of the 'Middle Bronze Age' (c. 1400‚Äì1100 BC) to exploit the wetter conditions. Cornwall was a major source of tin for much of western Europe and copper was extracted from sites such as the Great Orme mine in Northern Wales. Social groups appear to have been tribal but with growing complexity and hierarchies becoming apparent. Disruption of cultural patterns There is evidence of a relatively large-scale disruption of cultural patterns which some scholars think may indicate an invasion (or at least a migration) into Southern Great Britain around the 12th century BC. This disruption was felt far beyond Britain, even beyond Europe, as most of the great Near Eastern empires collapsed (or experienced severe difficulties) and the Sea Peoples harried the entire Mediterranean basin around this time. Cremation was adopted as a burial practice, with cemeteries of urns containing cremated individuals appearing in the archaeological record. According to John T. Koch and others, the Celtic languages developed during this Late Bronze Age period in an intensely trading-networked culture called the Atlantic Bronze Age that included Britain, Ireland, France, Spain and Portugal, but this stands in contrast to the more generally accepted view that Celtic origins lie with the Hallstatt culture.

Scott Tallon Walker and its earlier incarnations developed a reputation for modernism. History The firm was started by Michael Scott, one of Ireland's foremost architects of the 20th Century, with Norman D. Good and was called Scott and Good. The firm initially developed a reputation for designing hospitals. In 1938 Michael Scott broke his partnership with Norman D. Good to form 'Michael Scott Architect' During the Second World War the firm survived on small commissions, and following the war went on to work for the C√≥ras Iompair √âireann (CI√â), the national transport company, and designed such buildings as Donnybrook Bus Garage (together with Ove Arup, who set up Arup's first overseas office in Dublin at the request of Michael Scott), and Dublin Central Bus Station (Busaras). In 1957 the firm was recast as 'Michael Scott and Partners', with Ronnie Tallon and Robin Walker becoming partners in the practice. The design work from this period becoming more modern, influenced by Robin Walker's previous experience of working with Le Corbusier in Paris and studying under Mies van der Rohe in Chicago, and resulted in buildings such as the RT√â Radio Building, the Bank of Ireland Headquarters in Baggot Street (1968‚Äì1978) and the former P.J. Carroll's Factory (1967‚Äì69) in Dundalk, County Louth, which has also recently been added to Ireland's list of protected structures.Irish Times 4 December 2010 In 1975 the firm was renamed 'Scott Tallon Walker' following the retirement of the company's founder, Michael Scott, and the firm was awarded the prestigious RIBA Gold Medal.The Sunday Times 12 February 2006 Robin Walker retired from the company in 1982. In December 2010, Dr Ronnie Tallon was awarded the James Gandon Medal, a new lifetime achievement award from the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland. In the citation he was called \\"one of the most influential Irish architects of the last century\\".RIAI news release 2 December 2010 Notable buildings Aviva Stadium Bus√°ras in 2008 The company has been responsible for many influential and recognisable buildings in Ireland, such as the Dublin central bus station, known as Bus√°ras, completed in 1953, which was one of the first buildings of the modern style in Ireland. The firm attempted to bring art and architecture together, commissioning art to be incorporated in their buildings such as at Bus√°ras). The artists Patrick Scott and art critic Dorothy Walker both worked for the firm, and played a significant part in its architecture. The firm also worked with Louis le Brocquy and commissioned work from him and his wife Anne Madden. The Aviva Stadium in Dublin, Ireland, on the site of the old Lansdowne Road site, was designed by Populous in collaboration with Scott Tallon Walker Architects. The sustainably-built stadium features a host of green building features that enable it to integrate into its site while making the most of available resources. Designed as a sweeping crystalline bowl, the stadium harvests rainwater to irrigate the field, reuses waste heat for hot water, and is topped with a transparent roof that allows daylight to suffuse the interior spaces.

It is among the most important sites of the Stonehenge complex, having produced some of the most spectacular grave goods in Britain. It was excavated in 1808 by William Cunnington for Sir Richard Colt Hoare. The finds, including worked gold objects, are displayed at Wiltshire Museum in Devizes.  Description  Larger gold lozenge with gold belt buckle and a copper dagger, on display at the Wiltshire Museum. Design of the larger of the Bush Barrow gold lozenges Hexagon geometry was employed in both lozenge forms. Note the lozenges are not to relative scale. After Johnson 2008 Bush Barrow is situated around 1 kilometre southwest of Stonehenge on Normanton Down. It forms part of the Normanton Down Barrows cemetery. The surviving earthworks have an overall diameter of and comprise a large mound with breaks in the slope suggesting three phases of development. The barrow currently stands 3.3 metres high and its summit measures 10.5 metres in diameter. The barrow is one of the \\"associated sites\\" in the World Heritage Site covering Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites (Cultural, ID 373, 1986).UNESCO website The Normanton Down round barrow cemetery comprises some 40 barrows strung out along an east-west aligned ridge. Bush Barrow (so named by Cunnington because it had bushes on it) is towards the western end of the line of barrows, sited at the highest point of the ridge.  Contents  The barrow was excavated in 1808 by William Cunnington for Sir Richard Colt Hoare. It contained a male skeleton with a collection of funerary goods that make it 'the richest and most significant example of a Bronze Age burial monument not only in the Normanton Group or in association with Stonehenge, but arguably in the whole of Britain'. The items date the burial to the early Bronze Age, 1900-1700BC, and include a large 'lozenge'-shaped sheet of gold, a sheet gold belt plate, three bronze daggers, a bronze axe, a stone macehead and bronze rivets, all on display at the Wiltshire Museum, Devizes.  Bush Barrow Lozenge  The design of the artifact known as the Bush Barrow Lozenge, and the smaller lozenge, has been shown to be based on a hexagon construction. Both the shape and the decorative panels appear to have been created by repeating hexagons within a series of three concentric circles (each framing the series of smaller decorative panels).Johnson, Anthony, Solving Stonehenge: The New Key to an Ancient Enigma pp 182-185 (Thames & Hudson, 2008) The precision and accuracy displayed by the work demonstrates both a sophisticated tool kit and a sound knowledge of geometric form. A similar gold lozenge from Clandon Barrow, in Dorset, used a decagon in its design.  Daggers  Two of the bronze daggers have the largest blades of any from their period, whilst a third had a long wooden hilt originally decorated with up to 140,000 tiny gold studs forming a herringbone pattern. The studs are around wide and in length with over a thousand studs embedded in each square centimetre. David Dawson, Director of Wiltshire Heritage Museum has stated that: \\"The gold studs are remarkable evidence of the skill and craftsmanship of Bronze Age goldsmiths ‚Äì quite rightly described as 'the work of the gods'\\" Optician Ronald Rabbetts has said that \\"Only children and teenagers, and those adults who had become myopic naturally or due to the nature of their work as children, would have been able to create and manufacture such tiny objects.\\" It is thought that the gold came from Ireland, and the dagger was made in Brittany. The hilt lay forgotten for over 40 years from the 1960s, having been sent to Professor Atkinson at Cardiff University, and found by one of his successors in 2005.  Stone mace  An unusual stone mace head lay to the right of the skeleton, made out of a rare flecked fossilized fossil stromatoporoid (sea sponge), originating in Devon. It had a wooden handle, from which bone zig-zag decorations survive, reminiscent of items from Greece and Spain.  Antique knife  Some fragments of bronze rivets and other scraps of bronze have been identified as the remains of a knife that would have been at least 200 years older than the rest of the items. This dates the knife to being contemporary with the construction of the Stonehenge trilithons, and suggests a treasured antique or heirloom, buried along with the rich new items of the occupant of the barrow.  Wider context  It is not known why this barrow contained such rich grave goods compared to those around it. It occupies the highest point, but is not the tallest barrow, and is not obviously marked out as the principal barrow in the cemetery. In particular it is not known if other barrows in the vicinity have simply had such goods plundered long ago. Numerous finds have been made in other barrows, both by Cunnington and subsequently, but nothing to compare to these. According to Barrett and Bowden, \\"absence of evidence does not necessarily imply evidence of absence\\".

The game was released exclusively in Japan for the Family Computer on February 26, 1988. Gameplay The game consists of a total of ten stages. The game's objective is to recover the money that was stolen from Professor Ochanomizu's lab. Instead of the usual extra lives, Atom's remaining life energy is determined by the amount of uranium (abbreviated \\"uran\\" in the game) he has left in his disposal. Atom begins each stage with 300 uran points, that will gradually decrease with each second. Every time Atom gets hit by certain enemies, falls from a pitfall, or runs out of time, the professor will use his remaining uran points to rebuild Atom. The player can also summon the professor during gameplay to replenish their uran points. The game ends if both, Atom and the professor, use up all of their uran points. Atom's actions consists of a standard jump and punch attack, as well as the ability to fly through the air for a limited period. To fly, the play must hold down the directional pad left or right while jumping three times in a row. The player can also collect coins by jumping over enemies, allowing the player to buy items for Atom and use them during the game.

Background On the album's composition, band leader Michael Gira wrote on the website for Young God Records: Critical reception The album generally received positive reviews from music critics. Thom Jurek of Allmusic wrote: \\"Angels of Light's How I Loved You moves far from that terrain and into a zone of languid reverie, bittersweet longing, and crystalline excess,\\" while also stating that the record \\"reveals, once more, that for Michael Gira and his Angels of Light, there are no contradictions, no gods, and no monsters in the caverns of love's secret domain.\\" John Robinson of NME stated: \\"Like a dark meeting place for a tryst between Nick Cave and Sonic Youth, they take a funereal subject matter (e.g. \\"My Suicide\\"), and expand it over beautifully arranged and very huge spaces of time\\". Wilson Neate of Popmatters wrote: \\"Leonard Cohen once recorded a rather dark album called Songs of Love and Hate. The Angels of Light‚Äôs How I Loved You makes that record sound like a children‚Äôs birthday party,\\" while another Popmatters reviewer, Jason Thompson, commented: \\"How I Loved You is a successful and unique collection of love songs.\\" The latter writer also described the album as \\"harrowing, but passionate.\\" Nevertheless, Richard M. Juzwiak of Pitchfork gave the album a negative review, stating: \\"The fact that Gira attempts the monumental, snug fit is admirable. Sure, he sounds like he means what he's saying, but his esoteric words seem born more out of self-satisfaction than pleasing listeners. Ultimately, conviction does not compensate for inaccessibility; Gira's calluses, you see, sound much more like warts.\\" Track listing *On the physical CD, track 6 is labeled \\"New City in the Future\\", on all digital releases it is labeled \\"New York City in the Future\\".

In 1913, he moved to Transylvania, settling down in Marosv√°s√°rhely (T√¢rgu Mure≈ü). Between 1913 and 1945, he was a teacher in the Bolyai Gymnasium, a Reformed Church college in the city. In the interwar period, after the union of Transylvania with Romania, he became a member of the Erd√©lyi Helikon group in Marosv√©cs (Br√¢ncovene≈üti), as well as sitting on the editorial staff of Zord Id≈ë magazine. In 1937, he published one of his most successful works, the novel Tibold M√°rton, which depicted a Swabian family in the process of adopting Hungarian culture, as well as the problems faced by ethnic minorities in their relation to the majority. After 1945, Molter was employed by the Bolyai faculty in Cluj, where he lectured in German language and literature. Retiring in 1950, he moved back to T√¢rgu Mure»ô, and died there 31 years later.

Vice-Chancellor of Monash  In 1960, at just 47 years old, Matheson became the first Vice-Chancellor of Monash University, a position he held until 1976. Given only 12 months to prepare for the opening of the University, Matheson worked with exceptional speed and effectiveness. He assembled staff, established courses, and set up faculties, teaching and research facilities. When Monash opened, Matheson led and oversaw rapid development, from an empty site in Clayton, to a university recognised internationally for excellence in research and teaching. When the University opened in 1961, it had just 347 students; but 11 years into Matheson's term, it had expanded to over 12,000. Matheson managed the tumultuous years of student activism at Monash in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He was often criticised by some of the more radical students, but succeeded in maintaining strong academic standards throughout. His responsiveness to student ideas and demands meant the unrest was contained as successfully as possible. In an article written shortly after his death, the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering observed that \\"it is hard to imagine how Matheson could have built the university better.\\"ATSE ‚Äì MATHESON James Adam Louis The arts and social sciences library at the University's Clayton Campus is named in his honour.Clayton campus libraries, Monash University A book by Matheson published in 1980, Still learning, provides an account of his years at Monash. During his term as Vice-Chancellor, he sat on the Royal Commission on the collapse of Melbourne's King Street Bridge (from 1962 to 1963).  Later life  Beyond his work at Monash, Matheson also oversaw the development of two universities in Papua New Guinea, and was Chancellor of the University of Papua New Guinea from 1973 to 1975. He was active in a number of research and professional organisations in Australia. He was a Foundation Fellow of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering and President of the Institution of Engineers. Matheson received numerous distinguished awards for his achievements at Monash. He received Honorary Doctorates from Hong Kong, Manchester, Melbourne and Monash Universities.

It is located in the centre of the city at 112 Shigu Road. First built in 1870 during the Qing dynasty, it was later severely damaged during the Northern Expedition War and had to be rebuilt by the Chinese government in 1928. Since the 1930s it has served as the cathedral for the Archdiocese of Nanjing and is the only Catholic church within the city of Nanjing today. In 1982 it was also listed as a Jiangsu Provincial Historic Site. Beginnings The first church in Nanjing was established by the Italian Jesuit and one of the first missionaries to China, Matteo Ricci, in 1599, on one of the three occasions that he came to Nanjing. He bought up a private residence on the west side of the city at a place called Luosi Zhuanwan (ÁΩóÂØ∫ËΩ¨Êπæ or later written Ëû∫‰∏ùËΩ¨Êπæ), and with some minor modifications it was soon a centre of religious activities. It was not to last long however, for in 1618 there was an imperial decree banning the practice of Catholicism and the church was torn down. Reconstruction In 1870 a new Romanesque church was built by the French Jesuit Adrien de Carr√®re on a larger site that included the former site of Ricci's church and also the ruins of an old Buddhist temple. It was consecrated as the Church of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception. During the Northern Expedition War (1926‚Äì1927) it suffered severe damages and was even used as a stables for a period of time. Afterwards, in 1928 it was restored by the National Government and its appearance today is much the same as it was after this last restoration, despite having been somewhat damaged and closed as well during the Cultural Revolution.

Following salvage, the damaged ship was taken to Douglas, Isle of Man, where she remained until cut up for scrapping in January 2014.\\"Curtain to fall on Solway Harvester after storm delays\\" BBC News 15 January 2014 Career and sinking The Solway Harvester was launched in 1992. An automated scallop dredger, she was fitted with sections along the sides which would rotate out and upwards to deposit the catch on the deck. She was 70 ft (21m) long and had accommodation for eight on board, plus a workshop, ice machine and storage for the catch. She was owned by Richard Gidney and operated under the command of her skipper, Andrew (Craig) Mills. Her crew were all from the Isle of Whithorn in Wigtownshire in Dumfries and Galloway. On her final voyage, the Solway Harvester sailed from Kirkcudbright in the early hours of 10 January 2000. She headed into the Irish Sea to harvest scallops from the queen scallop grounds. There were seven crew members aboard, including an 18 year old and two 17 year olds. They remained off the grounds until the afternoon of the following day, 11 January. Having collected 150 bags of scallops, they hauled in their gear and began the return voyage. The weather meanwhile had begun to worsen, and skipper Craig Mills decided to seek shelter in Ramsey Bay, Isle of Man. Mills made a final phone call at 17:29. Nothing further was heard until 17:47, when a satellite picked up an emergency position radio beacon. A search and rescue mission was quickly organised, with lifeboats from Workington, Douglas and Ramsey and Port St Mary being launched. Helicopters flew out from RAF Prestwick and RAF Valley and a helicopter from the Irish Air Corps and a fixed wing aircraft from the Royal Ulster Constabulary joined in the search. Larger vessels also joined the search, with RFA Bayleaf and the Ben-my-Chree, the Isle of Man ferry moving into the area to help. The search was called off at dusk on 12 January, when two unopened liferafts were found. The Royal Navy was called in to assist and the Sandown class minehunter HMS Sandown began to search the sea bed. Sandown eventually located the wreck of the Solway Harvester on 15 January lying in 115 feet (35 m) of water, off the Isle of Man. The bodies of all seven crew members were found on board. They were: Andrew (Craig) Mills, Martin Milligan, Wesley Jolly, David Lyon, Robin Mills, David Mills and John Doyle Murphy. Cause of sinking Solway Harvester in Douglas, Isle of Man, 19 April 2010 The Marine Accident Investigation Branch launched an inquiry to determine the cause of sinking. In a report published in 2003, they concluded that the Solway Harvester‚Äôs fish room had flooded, making her unstable and eventually causing her to capsize. The report found that there were critical maintenance issues, including a flood alarm that did not work and a missing hatch cover. Water had drained unnoticed into the fish room through the deck scuttles, which had not been covered. The pump was blocked and the broken bilge alarm meant that the flooding went unnoticed by the crew. As the weather worsened to a Force 9 Gale, the Solway Harvester began to roll. Already unstable, she was eventually rolling at an angle of between 30 and 40 degrees. More water entered through the open deck scuttles, whilst the cargo shifted to starboard. Water became trapped on the main deck and continued to flood the fish room. The design of the Solway Harvester should have allowed her to return to rolling at 20 to 25 degrees, but the flooding had caused her to lose this stability. She continued to roll further and further on to her side, eventually capsizing suddenly. The Solway Harvester was salvaged and raised in a ¬£1 million operation funded by the government of the Isle of Man. Relatives of the victims later accused the Scottish Parliament of not doing enough to support the salvage operation. Richard Gidney was put on trial for manslaughter following the report, but the case collapsed in 2005. The boat sat in the harbour in Douglas, Isle of Man, available as evidence during the inquest into the fatalities. A memorial was erected on Douglas Head on the Isle of Man, in memory of those lost. On 8 November 2008, Coroner Michael Moyle ruled the deaths of all seven crew members as accidental. Parts of his report were heavily critical of Solway Harvester owner Richard Gidney over the ship's standard of maintenance and equipment, as well as her past safety record. The Solway Harvester was scrapped in a process that began in November 2013. Media interest In addition to news items, the Solway Harvester has featured in the BBC documentary series Coast (series 5, episode 1, first broadcast in the UK on 25 July 2010). The role of Reverend Alex Currie, who became the spokesperson for the bereaved families, was featured in a BBC Radio 4 documentary \\"A Life Less Ordinary\\", first broadcast on 13 October 2012.

Description  According to the hypothesis, the rapid instability occurs because long periods of steady prosperity and investment gains encourage a diminished perception of overall market risk, which promotes the leveraged risk of investing borrowed money instead of cash. The debt-leveraged financing of speculative investments exposes investors to a potential cash flow crisis, which may begin with a short period of modestly declining asset prices. In the event of a decline, the cash generated by assets is no longer sufficient to pay off the debt used to acquire the assets. Losses on such speculative assets prompt lenders to call in their loans. This rapidly amplifies a small decline into a collapse of asset values, related to the degree of leverage in the market. Leveraged investors are also forced to sell less-speculative positions to cover their loans. In severe situations, no buyers bid at prices recently quoted, fearing further declines. This starts a major sell-off, leading to a sudden and precipitous collapse in market-clearing asset prices, a sharp drop in market liquidity, and a severe demand for cash. The more general concept of a \\"Minsky cycle\\" consists of a repetitive chain of Minsky moments: a period of stability encourages risk taking, which leads to a period of instability when risks are realized as losses, which quickly exhausts participants into risk-averse trading (de-leveraging), restoring stability and setting up the next cycle. In this more general view, the Minsky cycle may apply to a wide range of human activities, beyond investment economics.  Context  The term was coined by Paul McCulley of PIMCO in 1998, to describe the 1998 Russian financial crisis, and was named after economist Hyman Minsky, who noted that bankers, traders, and other financiers periodically played the role of arsonists, setting the entire economy ablaze.Subprime mortgage crisis and possible recession BY JOHN CASSIDY Minsky opposed the deregulation that characterized the 1980s. Some, such as McCulley, have dated the start of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010 to a Minsky moment, and called the following crisis a \\"reverse Minsky journey\\"; McCulley dates the moment to August 2007,Global Central Bank Focus , by Paul McCulley while others date the start to some months earlier or later, such as the June 2007 failure of two Bear Stearns funds.

The film also stars Adam Goldberg and Daniel Br√ºhl. It was followed by the 2012 sequel 2 Days in New York. Premise Marion is a French-born photographer living in New York City with her neurotic, hypochondriacal, chain-smoking, heavily tattooed American interior designer boyfriend Jack. After a markedly unromantic trip to Venice, which was planned to re-ignite the passion in their relationship, they take a night train to Paris to pick up Marion's cat from her parents and decide to stay for two days. Jack is startled to learn Marion has remained in contact with numerous ex-lovers and becomes increasingly uncomfortable due to the language barrier and a multitude of her old flames she keeps meeting. Meanwhile, Marion wrestles with her own insecurities about love, relationships, and her impulsive nature. Cast Production The film was shot on location in Paris. Sites included Gare Du Nord train station, Pasteur station in the Paris M√©tro and the grave of Jim Morrison in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. Marie Pillet and Albert Delpy, who portray Marion's parents, are Julie Delpy's real-life parents. It was produced by Christophe Mazodier with his company Polaris Film Production & Finance. Distribution The film premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival. It went into theatrical release in Germany on 17 May 2007 and was shown at the Seattle International Film Festival, the Tremblant Film Festival in Canada, the Los Angeles Film Festival, and Paris Cin√©ma before going into theatrical release in France on 11 July and the United States on 10 August. Critical response Reviews were mostly positive. In the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert called Julie Delpy \\"an original, a woman who refuses to be defined or limited\\" and said she \\"has made a smart film with an edge to it... What she has done here is avoid all temptation to recycle the usual lovers-in-Paris possibilities, and has created two original, quirky characters so obsessed with their differences that Paris is almost a distraction.\\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times said the film \\"is an inside-out version of the much-admired Richard Linklater films Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, in which Ms. Delpy and Ethan Hawke portray a French-American pair who meet, part and reunite years later. Where Mr. Linklater's movies were weepies for the kind of educated, upscale young cosmopolites who have a soft spot for romances like Casablanca, Ms. Delpy's examination of modern love among the almost young and still restless is bracingly hard-headed.\\" In her review for the Los Angeles Times, Carina Chocano said, \\"At first blush, 2 Days in Paris looks like it's going to be the story of a culture-clashing couple. But slowly and rather slyly, Delpy zeros in on something much more subtle and complex. What interests her are not the superficial differences between people from different countries... but the way in which the distances between people, genders and cultures (the very distances we rely on to grant us the perspective needed to see how completely insane other people, genders, cultures really are) seem to shift constantly according to circumstances.\\" Awards and nominations Julie Delpy was nominated for the C√©sar Award for Best Writing, the European Film Awards Audience Award for Best Film, and the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Film. The film won the Coup de C≈ìur Award from the Mons International Festival of Love Films. It also won the Prix Jacques Pr√©vert du Sc√©nario for Best Original Screenplay in 2008. Sequel In February 2010, it was announced a sequel titled 2 Days in New York was in production. Actress/director Delpy re- teamed with Polaris Film to produce the \\"atypical sequel.\\" She directed the sequel in Manhattan in October and reprised her role as Marion, a Frenchwoman who now finds herself in New York with her child and a new guy, having broken up with her 2 Days in Paris lover (and the father of her child) who was played by Goldberg. \\"It's about the difficulty of relationships but also about the main character's evolution in general. It's a very modern story about the complexities of being a woman and not being completely consumed by your partner,\\" Delpy explained. Comedian Chris Rock confirmed on The Howard Stern Show on 8 November 2010 that he was set to play the \\"new guy\\" in the film. Other members of the Paris cast, including Delpy's real father Albert, returned to their same roles for the film.

The book is the fourteenth in the chronology of the Pip and Flinx series. It was published in April 2009. The novel is the final volume in the \\"Great Evil\\" story arc, but not the final Humanx Commonwealth novel, or even the final Flinx novel. Plot summary After his realization that civilization, both humanx and otherwise, is worth saving, Flinx sets out to find the ancient weapons platform built by the long extinct Tar-Aiym race to use against the Great Evil approaching the Commonwealth. Plot The novel is divided roughly into three sections. The first shows Flinx‚Äôs time spent on Blasusarr, the homeworld of the AAnn. The second deals with his reunion on New Riveira with Clarity Held and fighting off the Order of Null. The final part follows Flinx and his companions as they traverse known space looking for the ancient weapons system to fight off the Great Evil. Blasusarr In yet another attempt to avoid his destiny Flinx set out to become the first human to live on the AAnn homeworld Blasusarr. Disguised in a simsuit to perfectly take on the appearance of a common AAnn, Flinx successfully lives on the desert planet until his cover story unravels. In his escape attempt he befriends a juvenile AAnn from a prominent family. He manages to parlay this friendship into an audience with an AAnn lord who has influence with the AAnn emperor. After being threatened with arrest and execution, Flinx convinces the lord of the great danger both the AAnn empire and the Commonwealth are facing, by psychically projecting him into the mind of the approaching Great Evil. After slipping into the center of the AAnn government and confronting the emperor, who is determined to execute Flinx for his brashness and insult to the AAnn, Flinx once again projects himself and nearly a hundred AAnn lords into the mind of the Great Evil. This not only kills some of the lords and drives others comatose, but convinces the emperor to release Flinx to fight off the Evil. The emperor even goes so far as to order all AAnn aggression against Commonwealth systems to cease for a year so that Flinx can travel without worry outside the Commonwealth‚Äôs sphere of influence. Nur His decision made, Flinx travels to New Riveria to gather his companion Clarity Held before continuing on his search for the ancient Tar-Aiym weapons platform. After their somewhat rocky reunion, Clarity decides to accompany Flinx on his quest along with his old friends and mentors Truzenzuzex and Bran Tse-Mallory. Before the group can depart Nur, they are attacked by the Order of Null, who are still bent on killing Flinx to prevent his interference with the Great Evil, which they call the purity. Tru and Bran managed to escape or kill their attackers, but Clarity is taken hostage in order to draw out Flinx. Confronting the Order in their base, Flinx manages to disable the Order with his unreliable Talent not by trying to purposely incapacitate them, but by projecting feelings of life and love to overcome the Order members' normal state of ennui. After putting the group into a state of near-ecstatic pleasure, rendering them near-comatose, Flinx is confronted by a member of the Qwarm, hired by the Order to kill him if needed. Unable to fight off the Qwarm either by mental or physical means, just before he is about to be killed, Flinx is saved by Sylzenzuzex, the thranx equivalent of Tru's grandniece, an old friend now a security officer with the United Church. After this confrontation, with Syl joining the group after placing the remaining Order members into custody, they leave the planet. Shortly afterwards, some members of the Order escape custody to continue their pursuit of Flinx. The Blight Traveling into the Blight, Flinx and his group are at a loss on how to find the ancient Tar-Aiym weapons platform. The only solution that presents itself is to return to the planet Booster where Flinx and his mentors found the original Tar-Aiym Krang. Flinx hopes to use the Krang to find where the weapons platform went. Instead, he inadvertently calls the platform to Booster. Moving their ship over to the planet-sized weapon, the group then travels to the edge of the Milky Way galaxy to confront the Great Evil. After they activate the entire platform, the animate photonic wave created by the more than one hundred Krangs on the platform hits the Great Evil but does little more than superficial damage. The platform retreats back to the Blight, returning the group to Booster and then vanishing from the galaxy. Flinx consults with the Krang on Booster yet again, and this time is told that the ancient warning and alert system created by the Xunca a billion years ago might be the only other option available to save the Milky Way. Following the intermittent signal broadcast by the Xunca‚Äôs warning system, they now wind up in the middle of the blight in an asteroid field that Flinx manages to activate into reassembling itself into an ancient transport system created by the Xunca. They take the transport into an unknown dimension or location in space to what might be a weapon to turn away the Great Evil. While off the ship and trying to activate the device, Flinx‚Äôs companions are confronted by another ship, full of members of the Order of Null, led by Flinx‚Äôs half-sister Mahnahmi Lynx. While his mind is co-joined by the minds of the cetaceans of Cachalot, the plant-mind of Midworld and the guiding influence of the Krang, Flinx and his allies are able to turn on the ancient Xuncan device, which doesn‚Äôt so much destroy the Great Evil as make it disappear from the reality the Commonwealth inhabits. Meanwhile, on board the Teacher, Mahnahmi and the Order of Null attempt to kill Flinx‚Äôs friends. In the struggle, most of the members of the Order are killed, the Xunca weapon destroys their ship, and Flinx manages to revert Mahnahmi's mind to that of an infant. Aftermath In the wake of the destruction of the Great Evil, a group of new planets and stars is created in a line so straight and regular it defies all scientific expectation. The entire race of Saunn on Comagrave, asleep in a state of suspended animation for thousands of years, start to wake up. A Commonwealth peaceforcer responds to a distress signal on the intermittently appearing planet Quofum and rescues three scientists, two human and one thranx, missing for over four years. Clarity and Flinx decide to marry, doing so on the planet Alaspin before deciding to settle on the planet Cachalot. Reception The novel received mostly positive reviews. Fantasy-magazine.com said, ‚Äúthe last book of the series does not leave one ‚Äòlost in space,‚Äô but rather with a satisfying end to the story and a thirst for the previous books.‚Äù GenreGoRound sounded a similar note: ‚ÄúThe story line starts a bit slow as the strange bedfellows need introduction, but‚Ä¶Foster provides a triumphant climax to a wonderful series.‚Äù References  External links  *Alan Dean Foster Homepage * Scifi Wire Index Category:2009 American novels Category:2009 science fiction novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:Humanx Commonwealth Category:Novels by Alan Dean Foster Category:Sequel novels ","title":"Flinx Transcendent"},{"id":"13048131","text":"We Are Him is the fifth and final studio album by American experimental rock band Angels of Light.

He is the founding chairman of Quilliam, a counter-extremism think tank that seeks to challenge the narratives of Islamist extremists, and the host of a radio show on LBC, every Saturday and Sunday. Born in Southend-on- Sea, Essex to a British Pakistani family, Nawaz is a former member of the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir, an association that led to his December 2001 arrest in Egypt, where he remained imprisoned until 2006. Reading books on human rights and interacting with Amnesty International‚Äîwho adopted him as a prisoner of conscience‚Äîresulted in a change of heart: he left Hizb-ut-Tahrir in 2007, renounced his Islamist past, and called for a \\"secular Islam.\\" After his turnaround, Nawaz co-founded Quilliam with former Islamists, including Ed Husain. He wrote an autobiography, Radical (2012) and has since become a prominent critic of Islamism in the United Kingdom. He is a weekly columnist for The Daily Beast, and his writings have been published in various international newspapers; he appears frequently on television; and has delivered lectures including at the UK Defence Academy and Marshall Center for Security Studies. His second book, Islam and the Future of Tolerance (2015), co-authored with atheist author Sam Harris, was published in October 2015. He was the Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate for London's Hampstead and Kilburn constituency in the 2015 general election. Biography Nawaz was born in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, to parents of Pakistani origin. His mother, Abi, is described as a literature-loving liberal woman whose family moved to Southend when she was nine. His father, Mo, is an electrical engineer who had worked for the Pakistan Navy but had to leave on medical grounds after he contracted tuberculosis.Nawaz (2012): pp. 20‚Äì30. Mo later worked for the Dewan Group in Islamabad, Pakistan where he won a court case against his employer which had banned trade unions. After moving to the UK, Mo worked for an oil company in Libya, and moved between Libya and the UK until his retirement. Maajid has an elder brother and a younger sister. In his memoir, Radical, he uses the pseudonym Osman to denote his brother. Nawaz was educated at Westcliff High School for Boys, a grammar school in Westcliff-on-Sea, a suburb of Southend. Later, he studied Law and Arabic at SOAS, University of London and earned his master's degree in Political Theory from London School of Economics. At the age of 21, he married a then fellow Hizb ut-Tahrir activist who was a biology student; they have a son. On Nawaz's decision to leave Hizb ut-Tahrir, they separated and later divorced. In 2014, he married Rachel Maggart, an artist and writer from the United States who works for an art gallery in London.For the date, see For the name, see In February 2017, Nawaz and Maggart had their first child together, a son named Gibreal. In February 2019, Nawaz was reportedly assaulted in a racially-motivated attack by a white man. In July 2020, Nawaz began a hunger strike to protest against China's imprisonment and alleged atrocities of its Uyghur population and to promote a parliamentary petition urging the government to impose sanctions on China over its treatment of Uyghur Muslims. Maajid claimed the abuses amounted to genocide and that it \\"leaves no room for neutrality\\".https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/maajid- nawaz/uighur-muslim-genocide-hunger-strike-silence-is-complicit/ Within a week, the petition passed the 100,000 signature threshold, thereby ensuring that a debate on the issue would take place in the UK Parliament. Islamist activism Association with Hizb ut-Tahrir Nawaz cites racism whilst growing up, whether from classmates, C18 gangs or the police, and feeling divided between his Pakistani and British identities as important factors in his struggle to find his own identity. His elder brother, pseudonymously named as Osman, was recruited into Hizb ut-Tahrir by Nasim Ghani, who would later become the UK leader of Hizb ut-Tahrir. Osman subsequently persuaded Nawaz to attend HT meetings held in Southend homes.Nawaz (2012): pp. 80‚Äì91. At those meetings, recruits were shown videos that depicted Bosnian Muslims being massacred. These videos became the catalyst for Nawaz's formal recruitment in the HT. While a student at Newham College, and then at SOAS, Nawaz quickly rose through the ranks. By the age of 17, he was recruiting students from Cambridge University, and by 19, he was on the national leadership of HT in the United Kingdom. He became a national speaker and an international recruiter for Hizb ut-Tahrir, travelling to Pakistan and Denmark to further the party's ideology and set up organisational cells. Imprisonment in Egypt As part of his bachelor's degree in Law and Arabic, Nawaz spent a compulsory year abroad in Egypt, arriving just one day before the 9/11 attacks took place. Since political Islamist organisations like Hizb ut-Tahrir were banned in Egypt, Nawaz was arrested and interrogated in Alexandria by the Egyptian security agency Aman al-Dawlah. Like most foreign prisoners, he was not subjected to torture, but faced the threat of torture during interrogation and witnessed other prisoners being tortured.Nawaz (2012): p. 241. He was then transferred to Mazrah Tora prison and put on trial. Represented by Sadiq Khan, he was sentenced to five years' imprisonment.Nawaz (2012): p. 257. During the trial, he was adopted by Amnesty International as a prisoner of conscience,Nawaz (2012): pp. 250‚Äì57. who helped to secure his return to London. Disenchantment and exit from Hizb ut-Tahrir While imprisoned in Mazrah Tora, Nawaz came across a wide spectrum of Muslims with varying ideological leanings: Jihadists, Islamists, Islamic scholars and liberal Muslims.Nawaz (2012): pp. 262‚Äì63. Among the Jihadists were the members of the terrorist organisation al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, and the assassins of former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. He met Islamist Dr Essam el-Erian, the spokesman of the Muslim Brotherhood. and Mohammed Badie, who in his youth had smuggled the manuscripts of Syed Qutb's Islamist manual Milestones out of prison, and had it published. Among the Islamic Scholars, Nawaz continued his studies sitting with graduates of Cairo's Al-Azhar University and Dar al-'Ulum.Nawaz (2012): pp. 285‚Äì86. He specialised in the Arabic language whilst studying historical Muslim scholastics, sources of Islamic jurisprudence, Hadith historiography and the art of Qur'anic recitation. He also committed half of the Qur'an to memory.Nawaz (2012): p. 287. On the liberal end of the spectrum, he befriended author and sociologist Saad Eddin Ibrahim. He also benefited from the company of imprisoned Egyptian politician Ayman Nour who was the head of the centre-liberal Tomorrow Party and a runner- up to the 2005 Presidential Elections. By 2007 he had renounced his Islamist past, and called for a \\"secular Islam\\". In an interview with American broadcaster National Public Radio, Nawaz explained how, other than the interactions in prison, George Orwell's novel Animal Farm played a major role in his turnaround. Counter-extremist activism After completing his prison term in Egypt, Nawaz returned to the UK in 2006. In 2007, he resigned from Hizb-ut-Tahrir and resumed his bachelor's degree at SOAS.Nawaz (2012): pp. 323‚Äì5.Nawaz (2012): p. 331. He then founded the Quilliam Foundation, a counter-extremism think tank. He addressed the US Senate's Homeland Security Committee on the subject of Islamist extremism. He also spoke at the \\"Sovereign Challenge\\" conference organised by United States Special Operations Command where he advocated the need to move beyond hard power, and look at new counter-radicalisation strategies. Nawaz played a major role in Tommy Robinson's exit from the far-right English Defence League (EDL), of which Robinson was the founder. He met Robinson in 2013 during the filming of a BBC documentary When Tommy met Mo, and subsequently met the EDL's co-leader, Kevin Carroll. Nawaz's personal story of turning back from Islamist extremism, and his counter-extremism work at Quilliam Foundation encouraged Robinson and Carroll to quit the EDL. Later, Robinson also apologised to Muslims for the fear caused by his EDL activism. The move was hailed by Quilliam as \\"a huge success in community relations in the United Kingdom\\", and a continuation of combating all kinds of extremism, including Islamism and Neo-Nazism. In July 2012, he published his autobiography, Radical. Activities in Pakistan Nawaz has co-founded an activist group in Pakistan, Khudi, which aims to combat extremism. In 2009, with a BBC Newsnight crew and security team, Nawaz embarked on a counter-extremism tour, speaking at over 22 universities and recruiting students all over Pakistan. Hampstead and Kilburn constituency Liberal Democrat candidate Nawaz was selected in July 2013 to stand as the Liberal Democrat candidate for the marginal north London constituency of Hampstead and Kilburn, in which he came third. With the delegation of Liberal Democrat Friends of Israel he visited both sides of the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict.Ex-radical speaks with suicide bomb victim's father , thejc.com. In September 2013, Nawaz and his Camden District team was given the Dadabhai Naoroji Award for support and promotion of BAME (Black, Asian Minority Ethnic groups) party members. The award was presented by party MP Tim Farron. In the same year, he was included in The Daily Telegraphs list of 50 most influential Liberal Democrats. On 2 July 2020, Nawaz announced his resignation from the Liberal Democrats. Jesus and Mo cartoon In 2014, Nawaz received death threats after tweeting a Jesus and Mo cartoon alluding to the Islamic prophet Muhammad.Keith Perry \\"Lib Dem candidate receives death threats for tweeting Prophet Mohammed cartoon\\" Daily Telegraph 21 January 2014 Nawaz decided to tweet the cartoon after a BBC programme censored two audience member's shirts displaying innocuous cartoons of the prophet Muhammed.Nick Cohen \\"The Liberal Democrats face a true test of liberty\\" , The Observer, 25 January 2014 Respect Party politician George Galloway called on Muslims, via a tweet, not to vote for the Liberal Democrats while Nawaz is one of their candidates.Jessica Elgot \\"George Galloway And Muslim Activists Round On Lib Dem Candidate Maajid Nawaz\\" , The Huffington Post, 21 January 2014 By 24 January, a petition to the Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg demanding that Nawaz should be removed as a parliamentary candidate for the party had received 20,000 signatures. Petition organisers denied a connection to its alleged originator, Liberal Democrat member Mohammed Shafiq, and condemned the incitement to murder.Jonathan Brown and Ian Johnston \\"Nick Clegg attacks death threats against Maajid Nawaz ‚Äì Lib Dem candidate who tweeted a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed and Jesus greeting each other\\" , The Independent, 26 January 2014 On 26 January, Clegg defended Nawaz's right to free expression and said that the death threats were \\"unacceptable\\". SPLC claim In October 2016, the U.S. Southern Poverty Law Center accused Nawaz of being an \\"anti-Muslim extremist\\", a label disputed by various media outlets, and Nawaz himself. The Lantos Foundation for Human Rights & Justice wrote a public letter to the SPLC urging it to retract the listing. Nawaz announced his intention to file a defamation lawsuit against the SPLC on the 23 June 2017 episode of Real Time with Bill Maher. The SPLC deleted the HTML version of its list in April 2018. In June 2018, the SPLC apologised and paid $3.375 million to Nawaz and Quilliam \\"to fund their work to fight anti-Muslim bigotry and extremism\\". As part of the settlement, SPLC president Richard Cohen made a video apology, and released the following statement about Nawaz and the Quilliam Foundation: > \\"The Southern Poverty Law Center was wrong to include Maajid Nawaz and the > Quilliam Foundation in our Field Guide to Anti-Muslim Extremists. Since we > published the Field Guide, we have taken the time to do more research and > have consulted with human rights advocates we respect. We've found that Mr. > Nawaz and Quilliam have made valuable and important contributions to public > discourse, including by promoting pluralism and condemning both anti-Muslim > bigotry and Islamist extremism. Although we may have our differences with > some of the positions that Mr. Nawaz and Quilliam have taken, they are most > certainly not anti-Muslim extremists. We would like to extend our sincerest > apologies to Mr. Nawaz, Quilliam, and our readers for the error, and we wish > Mr. Nawaz and Quilliam all the best.\\" The agreement stipulated that the SPLC's apology was to be prominently displayed on various pages on their website, as well as distributed to every email address and mailing address on the SPLC mailing list. Views Security and human rights Nawaz has opposed racial profiling of Muslims, extrajudicial detention of terror suspects, torture, targeted killings and drone strikes. Nawaz also opposed the Terrorism Act 2000, under which he was himself once detained, and called for the universal right to legal representation and right to silence in all cases, and for all suspects. In a talk given at George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies, he suggested a revisit of the UK Government's historical approach to dealing with terrorism, and called for a more nuanced response to tackling the ideology of Islamism without breaching fundamental liberties of citizens. According to him, security should never debase citizens of their civil liberties. Nawaz was among the 12 advisers to UK Government who, in 2009, wrote an open letter to the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown asking him to hold Israel accountable for its attacks on Gaza. He also opposes Hamas, which he considers a terrorist organisation.OPINION: Palestine must be free ... from Hamas , jewishnews.co.uk. In the aftermath of the 2015 San Bernardino attack, during which a debate about profiling occurred, Nawaz said that racial or religious profiling was a \\"terrible measure\\" that \\"does not prevent terrorism\\". Jihadism and the Islamic State In an essay for The Wall Street Journal, Nawaz stated that Jihadists of all types seek to create discord by \\"pitting Muslims against non-Muslims in the West and Sunni Muslims against Shiite Muslims in the East\\". He argues that the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) is out to provoke a Clash of Civilisations, and we can avoid this clash by calling out the underlying Islamist ideology and isolating Jihadists from ordinary Muslims. He also took exception to Pope Francis's characterisation of Paris attacks as the start of \\"World War 3\\", noting that we are not facing another World War but a Global Jihadist insurgency. According to him, an insurgency is different from a conventional war in that insurgents rely on some level of support from the communities they recruit from. And since it is an insurgency, the Counter-insurgency strategy should have messaging and psychological warfare as its critical parts, with the aim of isolating insurgents from their target host communities. On a physical level, he supported the idea of an international coalition against ISIL, fronted by Sunni Arab forces and backed by international special forces. Nationalism and far-right movements In a CNN interview, he condemned Donald Trump's remarks about banning Muslims from entering the United States. Nawaz said that when leaders pump up their followers by promising them utopian visions, and then fail to deliver on those promises, followers take action into their own hands. He expressed his concern that disappointed followers of Trump will \\"end up joining fascist or far-right groups\\" and take matters into their own hands against the eight million Muslims in the United States\\".

Controversy  B√ºch exhibited pseudologia fantastica, uttering various falsehoods about his life. Tellingly, a 2004 biography has the subtitle (translated) \\"Report on a mystification\\". One of these lies was that he was the father of a child that had died at the age of around six. The boy he referred to did exist, but the child was not his and it did not die. This lie formed the basis of his successful novel De kleine blonde dood (\\"The small blond death\\"). Television One of B√ºch's most successful television programmes was De wereld van Boudewijn B√ºch (VARA, summer 1988 - autumn 2001), in which he travelled all around the world to show and give his views on various places, people and phenomena. Bibliophilia B√ºch was a bibliophile, specializing in various subjects, including biology, Goethe and explorers. At his death, he possessed approximately 100,000 books. Furthermore he was very interested in islands, specifically islands that were hard to visit, like Bouvet Island near Antarctica.

In 1982, Stanton replaced Ted Glossop as the Blues State of Origin coach, being the first NSW coach to contest a three-game Origin series. Queensland won the series 2‚Äì1 and Glossop returned to coach the Blues in 1983. Stanton again coached New South Wales in the 1984 Origin series to another 2‚Äì1 loss against the Maroons. Stanton was appointed Australia's Test coach in 1978 and in the next six years was rewarded with whitewash wins over Great Britain (1979, 1982 and 1984), New Zealand (1978, 1980 and 1982) and France (1981 and 1982). His 1982 side also won the first ever Test played against Papua New Guinea. The 1978 Kangaroo tourists, after a successful 2‚Äì1 Ashes campaign in England, wound up the French section of the tour with egg on their faces, losing both Tests in France. Whilst the refereeing in the first Test came in for criticism Stanton acknowledged no excuses for the Australian defeat in the second Test. The 1982 Kangaroo touring side avenged the French embarrassment of 1978. They were Australia's most successful ever national side going through the 23 match tour of Papua New Guinea, England and France unbeaten and becoming known as the Invincibles. Stanton retired as national coach in 1983 and was succeeded by Queensland coach Arthur Beetson. Beetson only lasted for the 1983 series against New Zealand, and was replaced after Australia won the first test at Auckland's Carlaw Park, but lost the second test at Lang Park in Brisbane. For the 1984 Ashes series against Great Britain, Stanton returned for his final stint as Australian coach. The Aussies won the series 3‚Äì0 and Stanton retired from representative coaching. During his time as Australian coach, Stanton oversaw the start of the stellar international careers of players such as Wally Lewis, Wayne Pearce, Mal Meninga, Peter Sterling, Brett Kenny, Kerry Boustead and Eric Grothe. He was the Chief Executive of the Manly club during the late 1980s up until the mid 1990s. Stanton was the interim Chief Executive of the Melbourne Storm for a period in 2004 and up till 2006 was a Board Director of the Storm. In 2010 Stanton was temporarily re-appointed as Storm caretaker-CEO following the sacking of Matt Hanson in the wake of the Storm's salary cap scandal. He remained in this role for three months until Ron Gauci took over.

It was triggered by pro-Byzantine revolts in areas of the Caucasus under Persian hegemony, although other events also contributed to its outbreak. The fighting was largely confined to the southern Caucasus and Mesopotamia, although it also extended into eastern Anatolia, Syria, and northern Iran. It was part of an intense sequence of wars between these two empires which occupied the majority of the 6th and early 7th centuries. It was also the last of the many wars between them to follow a pattern in which fighting was largely confined to frontier provinces and neither side achieved any lasting occupation of enemy territory beyond this border zone. It preceded a much more wide-ranging and dramatic final conflict in the early 7th century. Outbreak of war Less than a decade after the Fifty-Year Peace Treaty of 562, tensions mounted at all points of intersection between the two empires' spheres of influence, as had happened before when war broke out in the 520s. In 568‚Äì569, the Byzantines were engaged in ultimately abortive negotiations (cf. the embassy of Zemarchus) with the Gokturks for an alliance against Persia; in 570, the Sassanids invaded Yemen, expelling the Byzantines' Aksumite allies and restoring the Himyarite Kingdom as a client state; in 570 and 571, the Sassanids' Arab clients, the Lakhmids, launched raids on Byzantine territory, although on both occasions they were defeated by the Ghassanids, clients of the Byzantines; and in 570, the Byzantines made a secret agreement to support an Armenian rebellion against the Sassanids, which began in 571, accompanied by another revolt in Kingdom of Iberia.. Early in 572, the Armenians under Vardan II Mamikonian defeated the Persian governor of Armenia and captured his headquarters at Dvin; the Persians soon retook the city but shortly afterwards it was captured again by combined Armenian and Byzantine forces and direct hostilities between Byzantines and Persians began.. Despite frequent revolts in the 5th century, during the earlier wars of the 6th century the Armenians had largely remained loyal to their Sassanid overlords, unlike their neighbours and fellow Christians in Iberia and Lazica (Colchis). By joining the Iberians, Lazi, and Byzantines in a coalition of the region's Christian peoples, the Armenians dramatically shifted the balance of power in the Caucasus, helping Byzantine forces to carry the war deeper into Persian territory than had previously been possible on this front: throughout the war, Byzantine forces were able to invade as far as Albania (modern Azerbaijan) and even wintered there.. Fall of Dara In Mesopotamia, however, the war began disastrously for the Byzantines. After a victory at Sargathon in 573, they laid siege to Nisibis and were apparently on the point of capturing this, the chief bulwark of the Persian frontier defences, when the abrupt dismissal of their general Marcian led to a disorderly retreat.. Taking advantage of Byzantine confusion, Sassanid forces under Khosrow I (r. 531‚Äì579) swiftly counter-attacked and encircled Dara, capturing the city after a four-month siege. At the same time, a smaller Persian army under Adarmahan ravaged Syria, sacking Apamea and a number of other cities.. They were only pushed away from Syria proper by a bumbling Byzantine defence near Antioch.persianempire.info To make matters worse, in 572 the Byzantine emperor Justin II (r. 565-578) had ordered the assassination of the Ghassanid king al- Mundhir III; as a result of the unsuccessful attempt on his life, al-Mundhir severed his alliance with the Byzantines, leaving their desert frontier exposed.. The fall of Dara, the main Byzantine stronghold in Mesopotamia, reportedly drove Justin II to insanity, and control of the Byzantine Empire passed to his wife Sophia and Tiberius Constantine. The new regents agreed to pay 45,000 nomismata for a one-year truce, and later in the year extended this to five years, secured by an annual payment of 30,000 nomismata. However, these truces applied only to the Mesopotamian front; in the Caucasus, the war continued.. Khosrow I's last campaign In 575, the Byzantines managed to settle their differences with the Ghassanids; this renewal of their alliance at once bore dramatic fruit as the Ghassanids sacked the Lakhmid capital at Hira... In the same year, Byzantine forces took advantage of the favourable situation in the Caucasus to campaign in Caucasian Albania and secure hostages from the native tribes. In 576, Khosrow I set out on what was to be his last campaign and one of his most ambitious, staging a long-range strike through the Caucasus into Anatolia, where Persian armies had not been since the time of Shapur I (r. 240‚Äì270). His attempts to attack Theodosiopolis and Caesarea were thwarted, but he managed to sack Sebasteia before withdrawing. On the way home, he was intercepted and severely defeated near Melitene by Justinian, the magister militum of the East; pillaging the undefended city of Melitene as they fled, his army suffered further heavy losses as they crossed the Euphrates under Byzantine attack. Khosrow was reportedly so shaken by this fiasco and his own narrow escape that he established a law forbidding any of his successors from leading an army in person, unless to face another monarch also campaigning in person.. The Byzantines exploited Persian disarray by raiding deep into Caucasian Albania and Azerbaijan, launching raids across the Caspian Sea against northern Iran, wintering in Persian territory and continuing their attacks into the summer of 577. Khosrow now sued for peace, but a victory in Armenia by his general Tamkhosrau over his recent nemesis Justinian stiffened his resolve and the war continued.. War returns to Mesopotamia In 578, the truce in Mesopotamia came to an end and the main focus of the war shifted to that front. After Persian raids in Mesopotamia, the new magister militum of the East Maurice mounted raids on both sides of the Tigris, captured the fortress of Aphumon and sacked Singara. Khosrow again sought peace in 579, but died before an agreement could be reached and his successor Hormizd IV (r. 579‚Äì590) broke off the negotiations.. In 580, the Ghassanids scored yet another victory over the Lakhmids, while Byzantine raids again penetrated east of the Tigris. However, around this time the future Khosrow II was put in charge of the situation in Armenia, where he succeeded in convincing most of the rebel leaders to return to Sassanid allegiance, although Iberia remained loyal to the Byzantines.. The following year, an ambitious campaign along the Euphrates by Byzantine forces under Maurice and Ghassanid forces under al-Mundhir III failed to make progress, while the Persians under Adarmahan mounted a devastating campaign in Mesopotamia. Maurice and al-Mundhir blamed each other for these difficulties, and their mutual recriminations led to al-Mundhir's arrest in the following year on suspicion of treachery, triggering war between Byzantines and Ghassanids and marking the beginning of the end of the Ghassanid kingdom.. Stalemate In 582, after a victory at Constantina over Adarmahan and Tamkhosrau in which the latter was killed, Maurice was acclaimed emperor following the death of Tiberius II Constantine (r. 574‚Äì582). The advantage gained at Constantina was lost later in the year when his successor as magister militum of the East, John Mystacon, was defeated on the river Nymphios by Kardarigan.. During the mid-580s, the war continued inconclusively through raids and counter-raids, punctuated by abortive peace talks; the one significant clash was a Byzantine victory at the Battle of Solachon in 586.; . The arrest by the Byzantines of al-Mundhir's successor al-Nu'man in 584 led to the fragmentation of the Ghassanid kingdom, which reverted to a loose tribal coalition and never regained its former power.. In 588, a mutiny by unpaid Byzantine troops against their new commander, Priscus, seemed to offer the Sassanids a chance for a breakthrough, but the mutineers themselves repulsed the ensuing Persian offensive; after a subsequent defeat at Tsalkajur, the Byzantines won another victory at Martyropolis. During this year, a group of prisoners taken at the fall of Dara 15 years earlier reportedly escaped from their prison in Khuzestan and fought their way back to Byzantine territory.; . Civil War in Persia In 589, the course of the war was abruptly transformed. In spring, the Byzantine pay dispute was settled, bringing an end to the mutiny, but Martyropolis fell to the Persians through the treachery of an officer named Sittas and Byzantine attempts to retake it failed, although the Byzantines won a battle at Sisauranon later in the year and managed to capture its commander, Bleschames. Meanwhile, in the Caucasus, Byzantine and Iberian offensives were repulsed by the Persian general Bahram Chobin, who had recently been transferred from the Central Asian front where he had brought a war with the Gokturks to a successful conclusion. However, after he was defeated by the Byzantines under Romanus on the river Araxes, Bahram was contemptuously dismissed by Hormizd IV. The general, enraged at this humiliation, raised a revolt which soon gained the support of much of the Sassanid army. Alarmed by his advance, in 590 members of the Persian court overthrew and killed Hormizd, raising his son to the throne as Khosrow II (r. 590‚Äì628). Bahram pressed on with his revolt regardless and the defeated Khosrow was soon forced to flee for safety to Byzantine territory, while Bahram took the throne as Bahram VI, marking the first interruption of the Sassanid dynasty's rule since their empire's foundation. With support from Maurice, Khosrow set out to regain the throne, winning the support of the main Persian army at Nisibis and returning Martyropolis to his Byzantine allies. Early in 591, an army sent by Bahram was defeated by Khosrow's supporters near Nisibis, and Ctesiphon was subsequently taken for Khosrow by Mahbodh. Having restored Dara to Byzantine control, Khosrow and the magister militum of the East Narses led a combined army of Byzantine and Persian troops from Mesopotamia into Azerbaijan to confront Bahram, while a second Byzantine army under the magister militum of Armenia John Mystacon staged a pincer movement from the north. At the Battle of Blarathon near Ganzak they decisively defeated Bahram, restoring Khosrow II to power and bringing the war to an end. Aftermath Having played a vital role in restoring Khosrow II to the throne, the Byzantines were left in a dominant position in their relations with Persia. Khosrow not only returned Dara and Martyropolis in exchange for Maurice's assistance, but also agreed to a new partition of the Caucasus by which the Sassanids handed over to the Byzantines many cities, including Tigranokert, Manzikert, Baguana, Valarsakert, Bagaran, Vardkesavan, Yerevan, Ani, Kars, and Zarisat. The western part of the Kingdom of Iberia, including the cities of Ardahan, Lori, Dmanisi, Lomsia, Mtskheta, and Tontio became Byzantine dependencies. Also, the city of Cytaea was given to Lazica, also a Byzantine dependency. Thus the extent of effective Byzantine control in the Caucasus reached its zenith historically. Also, unlike previous truces and peace treaties, which had usually involved the Byzantines making monetary payments either for peace, for the return of occupied territories, or as a contribution towards the defence of the Caucasus passes, no such payments were included on this occasion, marking a major shift in the balance of power. Emperor Maurice was even in a position to overcome his predecessor's omissions in the Balkans by extensive campaigns. However, this situation was soon dramatically overturned, as the alliance between Maurice and Khosrow helped trigger a new war only eleven years later, with catastrophic results for both empires.

It is a continuation of three films released by Full Moon Features: Dollman, Demonic Toys and Bad Channels. Much of the movie consists of flashbacks from the three previous movies, aimed to enhance the story and promote the earlier movies. This film was followed by Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys in 2004 with alternate designs for the toys, which initially aired on Syfy. In 2009, an actual sequel to the first film, titled Demonic Toys 2, was released, which ignores the events in Dollman vs. Demonic Toys. Plot The film begins with Brick Bardo (Tim Thomerson, from Dollman) hitchhiking to get to the town of Pahoota, where he tries to find a girl named Nurse Ginger (Melissa Behr, who was shrunken to 11 inches in Bad Channels), to prove to her that she is not alone. Meanwhile, the film cuts to Judith Grey (Tracy Scoggins from Demonic Toys), who has a nightmare about the events that happened in the previous film a year before. Ever since the events that took place a year before, Judith has been watching the Toyland Warehouse, believing that the toys are still alive. Meanwhile, a drunken bum (R.C. Bates) enters the warehouse to shelter from the rain, and starts to mess around with a clown tricycle, until he gets knocked in the head with a box of toys, causing him to hit his head on the ground, killing him. However, his blood continues to flow over to the place where the demon was buried, and brings back: Baby Oopsy Daisy, Jack Attack, and Mr. Static, but Grizzly Teddy is replaced by a new toy named Zombietoid - a blonde GI Joe action figure with a machete as a weapon. Judith, who's now inside the building, sees the toys in full view, but is then arrested for breaking into a secluded building while serving out a suspension. After the police leave, the toys force the new security guard Ray Vernon (Phil Fondacaro) to help them with their needs. Ginger who spends her time on a kitchen counter all alone is being harassed by a sleazy reporter (Phil Brock) for an interview and so she reluctantly agrees to one so he'll leave her in peace. After he leaves, a big spider appears and as Ginger screams, Brick suddenly shows up and shoots it dead. Then a surprised Ginger asks Brick how he's so tiny like her, which results in both characters recapping their stories. Although Ginger explains that it's herself who's been left at a doll sized height by aliens, instead of Bunny, which was what occurred in the actual story of Bad Channels. Meanwhile, Judith, who now knows about Nurse Ginger and Brick Bardo's history, bribes the news reporter to tell her where they are, and tells her they are in Pahoota. Judith, after having a deal with Bardo and Ginger to help her kill the toys, go to the warehouse and Ginger initially doesn't believe the tale about the toys being really alive. Meanwhile, the toys kill a blonde hooker and makes her bleed on the place where the demon was buried. As Judith and friends enter the building, a fight begins, ending with Judith weakenly shooting Ray in the head (killing him) before getting shot herself by Mr. Static which then Brick blasts him to pieces. Brick, who has made a promise to Judith (cop to cop thing), continues to finish that promise, but Zombietoid knocks his gun out of his hand and it falls under a pile of crates, and has his hands and feet tied to two toy trucks, and Ginger tied on to a clock when they are separated inside the ventilation shafts. Baby Oopsy Daisy explains to Brick that once midnight strikes, the Demon's soul is going to go inside Baby Oopsy Daisy, so he can rape Nurse Ginger, make the baby, eat its soul from the shell, and become a human. As Baby Oopsie Daisy is about to kill Brick, Ginger breaks free, cuts him loose, and gets carried away by Zombietoid, who continues to go after Brick. Brick and Zombietoid begin fighting, until Zombietoid's machete gets caught in an electric socket, killing him. After using a hockey stick to retrieve his gun, Brick continues on and finds Jack Attack, whom he kills by shooting its face with a single bullet, causing Jack Attack to die laughing, then leaving only his torso intact. Brick finally gets to the dollhouse shortly after the stroke of midnight and sees Baby Oopsy Daisy undressing Ginger in preparation for sex. Baby Oopsy Daisey demands Brick to drop his firearm or he will quickly kill Ginger with cervical dislocation. Brick complies and tosses his gun out of his reach. Baby Oopsy Daisy tries to penetrate Ginger but is once again interrupted, this time due to a hard kick to his groin by Ginger after he unwittingly mentions that he is now possessed by \\"The Master\\" and has a penis. The low blow causes her to be released from Baby Oopsy Daisey's grasp, giving Brick the opportunity to quickly summon his gun where he then shoots the bewildered Baby Oopsy Daisy several times, killing him. Brick continues to call the police and tells them that Judith Grey died in the line of duty, and leaves, along with Nurse Ginger to a cab that is on its way back to Pahoota.

They released six studio albums, one EP, and three singles in the duration of their career. After the release of Goodbye in 2004, five of the six members of The Czars left the band over the span of nine months, leaving John Grant as the sole member of the band. After the exit of the other members, John Grant continued to tour under the name before deciding to pursue a solo career. Members Andy Monley and Roger Green, along with musician David Devine, appear on Sorry I Made You Cry as guitarists. Following the band's breakup, Grant took some time off from the music business, and returned to recording and performing in 2010 with his debut solo album Queen of Denmark.\\"John Grant getting his sad mojo working\\". Toronto Star, December 3, 2010. History Originally going by the name Titanic, The Czars was formed by Grant, Pearson, and Linsenmaier after Grant came back from a long stay in Germany in 1994. Prior to forming the band, John Grant aspired to be a translator in Germany before realizing that his English skills were poor and he would be unable to have the job he desired. The band went through numerous personnel changes in its early stages. It took a few years before the official line-up was formed: John Grant on vocals and piano, Jeff Linsenmaier on drums, Andy Monley and Roger Green on guitar, and Chris Pearson on bass. In 1996, the band's demos were released on the album Mood Swing through their own record label, Velveteen Records. The following year, the album The La Brea Tar Pits of Routine was also released by Velveteen Records. It has been noted by John Grant that the band and himself were dissatisfied with this album. Grant personally felt that the songs on the album weren't strong on a lyrical level and some of his vocals were out of tune. Both releases were self-produced and self-released by the band. During this period of time, John Grant's lyrics were mostly improvised and he often added new words to his lyrics during live performances, making it difficult for Grant to ever do the same song twice. The same year The Czars released The La Brea Tar Pits of Routine, Simon Raymonde, former bassist of the Cocteau Twins, formed the record label Bella Union. Grant, a big fan of Cocteau Twins, used this as an opportunity to send a disc to the label. Raymonde was pleased with their efforts and saw potential in the band, but the tracks he received didn't impress him enough to immediately work with the band. This did not end the relationship between Raymonde and The Czars. Instead, it opened up a line of communication between the two and The Czars continued to create demos to send to Raymonde. The demos that were sent after the initial disc impressed Raymonde and the band was invited to start an album on the Bella Union label. With the help of Simon Raymonde as the producer, the Czars began to work on their new album, Before...But Longer in London. Simon did not request a certain sound for the band and allowed them to create and work on their own sound at their own pace. Grant's long writing process as a songwriter caused a lot of the music to be recorded before any lyrics were attached to the song. Most of Grant's songwriting for this album took place near paths by the Thames in Twickenham and Richmond on park benches. He decided to abandon his previous form of songwriting, which mostly relied on improvisation, and started to write lyrics that were more set in stone. Grant said the following about his writing process for the album: \\"I used to think it was cool to improvise like that but not anymore. For example, Val, the single from the album, I had different lyrics for that one every time. And when I finally got lyrics that were set in stone it was the first time I was really able to enjoy the song and really sing it with feeling. That's another thing, you can't really sing anything with conviction if it's improvised every time because it's always different.\\" The recording of Before...But Longer took place in 1998 and the album was finished in September. With no team in place, no agent, no European licensee, no live show, Raymonde then spent a year trying to drum up interest for the band in the musical community to enable him to launch the band. Upon the actual release of the album in 2000, the band had already considered the material to be old, and didn't seem that keen to promote it, but despite this, the album was received decently. Drowned in Sound gave the album 8/10. In 2000 the band began to work on 'The Ugly People vs The Beautiful People' with Simon Raymonde providing his production services gratis once again, leaving his young family back in London while he and The Czars battled their way through the new songs in snowy Denver. The Czars also appeared on the compilation album, Sing a Song for You: A Tribute to Tim Buckley after being asked to cover \\"Song to the Siren\\" and were also asked to compose the soundtrack for the independent film I'd Rather Be... Gone. The EP, X Would Rather Listen to Y Than Suffer Through a C of Z's was self-produced by the band and released during the 2002 tour. The name of the EP is a joke and came from a dictionary. John Grant has said the following about the meaning of the title: \\"It's just a joke about how people use calculated formulas with people when they go out into to the world to deal with people and how that simply doesn't work.\\" Violinist Elin Palmer joined the band in 2003 and contributed to the album, Goodbye. Having sunk several thousand dollars into the band over the course of the two previous albums, and with the band facing a large unrecouped balance, the label decided to hold off on picking up the next option. The band received help from friends and within a year or so had made the album Goodbye, which Grant has stated is his favorite Czars album. Despite Goodbye's critical acclaim, it was the final album made by the band. Five out of the six members decided to part ways over a span of nine months in 2004, resulting in John Grant being the only member. Grant continued to perform live with the moniker until finally deciding to part with the name. In 2005, Bella Union released a compilation of b-sides and rarities by the band, titled Sorry I Made You Cry. Best Of compilation album came out on December 1, 2014, on Bella Union.

While in the Navy, he pitched for a team that included major leaguers as Mickey Owen, Jim Konstanty and Eddie Yost. He was discharged in time for the start of the 1946 season with Boston. Dreisewerd enjoyed his most productive season with the 1946 American League champion Red Sox, going 4‚Äì1 in 20 games pitched in relief, except for one start. He also pitched 1/3 of an inning in Game 4 of the memorable 1946 World Series between the Red Sox and St. Louis Cardinals, retiring Enos Slaughter, who had four hits and needed another to set a Series record. In 1947, Dreisewerd was sent down to the Red Sox Class Triple-A farm team in Louisville, and led the American Association pitchers with 18 wins and a 2.15 ERA. He divided his playing time with the St. Louis Browns and New York Giants in 1948, his last major league season. In a four-season career, Dreisewerd posted a 6‚Äì8 record with 39 strikeouts and a 4.54 ERA in 46 appearances, including 10 starts, three complete games, two saves and 140.2 innings pitched. In October 1948 Dreisewerd tried winter baseball in Venezuela, but after a month a coup d'√©tat caused the suspension of the baseball season. A year later he developed severe arm problems, and after unsuccessful tries with various minor league teams he was convinced that his baseball career was finished. After retiring from baseball Dreisewerd worked as a construction contractor, building homes in the New Orleans area, where he lived for 50 years. By 1999, he was legally blind with macular degeneration. He died in Ocean Springs, Mississippi at age 85, of head injuries suffered in a fall during a vacation.

Their habitat was west of the Euphrates, between the mouth of the Khabur and Palmyra. They were first mentioned in the sources since Rim-Anum (18th century BC), a king of Uruk, and in texts from Mari; then, in the 14th century BC in Egyptian sources, in one of the Amarna letters, in the days of Akhenaten, where it is affirmed that they had advanced until the Euphrates. Etymology Although the etymology and meaning is ultimately uncertain, it can be safely be said to derive from the Semitic language family. In the past it was proposed as \\"companion or confederate\\" by an error of scholar Wayne T. Pitard, comparing it to an unrelated Arabic root, presumably ÿ≠ ŸÑ ŸÅ (·∏•-l-f), which does indeed mean such. The more recent proposal by Lipi≈Ñski, connects it instead to ÿ∫ ŸÑ ŸÖ (·∏°-l-m) denoting a boy, lad, post-pubescent youth, a young man, a man full of virility or prowess, the prime of his life, full of testosterone, wild or lusty. The sense of puberty and hitting sexual as well physical maturity can be found as well in the variant ÿ≠ ŸÑ ŸÖ (·∏•-l-m). He further compares the word form as a broken plural pattern found common in Arabic; bands of wild young men. There is also a scholarly debate as to whether this term is a proper name of a group or rather a designation of a type of group. The significance of this comes in identifying possible genealogical backgrounds and connections of some groups given this appellation, such as the Aramaeans and even some tribes that had elsewhere been called Amorites. It would imply either sub-tribes of an over-arching \\"A·∏´lamite\\" people or rather as separate distinct peoples identified as such by a similar lifestyle. This would be a nomadic designation of the roaming raiding forces that made forays and razzias to capture flocks, slaves, and food supplies from the desert regions South and West of Mesopotamia. History In part, these Ahlamu certainly meant the Amorites. One of the tribes of the Ahlamu were the Arameans, they often acted together with the Suteans. Raids of the Ahlamu are also performed in the Persian Gulf in that they may have disrupted or interrupted trading in Dilmun. In one of his inscriptions, the Assyrian king Adad-nirari II states that his father, Ashur-dan II, defeated different peoples of the mountains including Ahlamu nomads. According to the inscription of another Assyrian king, Shalmaneser I, the Ahlamu with the Mitannian support of Shattuara II of Hanigalbat, were defeated in their uprising against the Assyrians. Ahlamu were even able to obstruct communication between kingdoms, mentioned by king of Babylon Kadashman-Enlil II, in his relations with the Hittite king ·∏™attu≈°ili III, in which he complains about the interruption of sending messengers between the two courts, under the pretext of the assaults of Ahlamu bandit. From the 12th century B.C.E. onward, the Mesopotamians increasingly referred to these same mobile groups as \\"Arameans.\\" They are also known as enemies of the Assyrians, when Assyria resurfaces again, already in the time of the monarch Ashur-resh-ishi I, he alluded to victories over the Ahlamu, and Gutians, so did his successor, Tiglath-Pileser I. The Assyrian king, Arik-den- ili, turned westward into The Levant (modern Syria and Lebanon), where he managed to subjugate the Suteans, the Ahlamu and the Yauru, in the region of Katmu·∏´i in the middle Euphrates. Social life Ahlamu could fight on their own as they acted as mercenaries with other peoples like the Hittites or the Mitannis. In addition, because of their excellent knowledge of the desert, they were sometimes hired as caravan guides or drovers, the same as the nomads Suteans for large commercial expeditions. Moreover, they lived in tents, under the jurisdiction of a sheikh, Rab ZƒÅrƒÅti, lord of the tent camp. In the Kassitic Nippur, they served as guards. Some of them had Kassitic or Babylonian names, although history says that they were not always reliable.

The telson usually bears two terminal setae. Males have generally two pairs of pleopods, though in rare cases they may be rather small or even entirely absent. The flagellum of the second antenna reaches past the pereon. In females the second antenna is much smaller than the first antenna. In males the third maxilliped and the first four pereiopods almost always have exopods (outer branches). In females they may, in rare cases, be absent from all but the third maxillipeds, and the two first pereiopods.

It was originally a convent of Franciscan friars, hence its name, and was built in 1531, and heavily rebuilt during the 18th and 19th centuries. The dining room at the Convent has the most extensive display of heraldry in the Commonwealth of Nations.Bond, page. 103 History Mid 19th century fa√ßade of The Convent View of The Convent and its environs from the Upper Town in 1879, with the building's iconic balcony being constructed The Convent in a 1909 postcard Franciscan friars arrived in Gibraltar during the reign of Charles I of Spain. They were granted a plot of land in the area known at the time as La Turba where the poorer people of Gibraltar lived. A church and a friary were built in 1531. The entrance was at the back (what is now Governor's Lane). It stretched up to the area that is occupied today by the John Mackintosh Hall.Churches in Gibraltar prior to 1704 After the capture of Gibraltar by an Anglo-Dutch fleet in the name of the Archduke Charles, the Franciscan friars did not follow the exodus of the Spanish population and remained in Gibraltar, at least for some years (their presence was recorded in 1712). The Franciscan friary was later taken over as the residence of the British governors in 1728 and has remained so ever since. The building was heavily rebuilt during the 18th and 19th centuries in the Georgian style with Victorian elements. In 1903 Gibraltar received its first visit from a British Monarch when Edward VII arrived to name the new No. 3 Dock of Gibraltar Harbour after himself. He received complaints that as head of the Church of England he should visit a Roman Catholic institution like The Convent. The King requested that the building should be called Government House. The new dry docks attracted Queen Alexandra in HMY Victoria and Albert in 1906 and the Prince and Princess of Wales the following year to name dock number two and then one after themselves. Overview Main Street entrance to the Governor's House, The Convent The Convent is situated towards the southern end of Main Street. A guard mount takes place at the main entrance a few days a week conducted by soldiers of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment. The Changing of the Guard is also conducted outside the Convent a few times a year. King's Chapel The garrison church adjacent to the Convent, part of the original Franciscan complex, was renamed Queen's Chapel during Queen Victoria's reign, but Queen Elizabeth II restored it back to its original title. Inside the chapel, beneath the colours of several British regiments, lie the remains of the wife of the Spanish governor of 1648, together with those of two British governors: General Charles O'Hara and Lieutenant-General Colin Campbell, who were laid to rest in 1802 and 1814, respectively. Ghost story Edward VII, German Emperor Wilhelm II, Japanese Emperor Hirohito and Queen Elizabeth II. The convent is supposedly haunted by the ghost of a nun, known as \\"Lady in Grey\\" who is said to roam the corridor outside one of the guest rooms. It is said that she considers it to be her room, as she was walled up alive in it. There are various versions of the \\"Grey Lady\\" story, the most popular being that she was the daughter of an affluent Spanish family who had married against her father's wishes. When he learnt of it, he placed her in the \\"Convent of Santa Clara\\" situated in the Main Street, where under the eyes of the Mother Superior, the girl was forced to take her vows and become a nun. Her lover was not discouraged; he joined the Franciscan Order and settled in the Convent. The couple are said to have met in the confessional of the King's Chapel where they hatched plans for their escape. On the night of their escape they made their way to the harbour where a boat was waiting for them. However, the alarm was raised and in the ensuing chase the lover fell into the water and drowned. The bride was arrested for breaking her vows and as punishment was walled up alive in one of the rooms in the Convent.

However, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Azerbaijan became independent by enactment of the constitutional act of national independence on October 18, 1991. http://www.judicialcouncil.gov.az/Meqaleler/Fikrat_Mammadov_e11.pdf Azerbaijan started reformation of the legal system by the establishing of democratic reforms. This was followed by the adoption of the first Constitution in 1995 which is the foundation of the legislative system of the modern country.http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Azerbaijan.html#_1._The_Legal_System%20of%20the%20Republic The Constitution creates the system of presidential republic with a separation of powers among the Legislative, Executive and Judicial branches of the government in order to prevent abuse of power.ghttp://azerbaijan.az/portal/General/Constitution/doc/constitution_e.pdf Civil law The term civil law in Azerbaijan refers to private law, which is opposed to the common law system of Criminal law and Civil law. The major body of statutes and laws governing civil law and procedure are set out in the Civil Code of Azerbaijan, established in December 1999.http://www.azpromo.az/uploads/legislation/Civil_code_eng_51b1e34e863c1.pdf Criminal law The current Criminal Code of Azerbaijan came into force in September 2000, replacing the older Criminal Code of 1960 which had been based on the principles of Soviet law.The Basic Structure of the Azerbaijan Legislative System Article 1 of the Criminal Code states that \\"the Criminal legislation of the Republic of Azerbaijan consists of this Code. New laws defining criminal responsibility are subject to inclusion in this Code\\"; this is characteristic of civil law legal systems such as France and Italy. In 1998 Azerbaijan was the first country in the Orient to abolish the capital punishment. Sources of law Unlike common law systems such as the United States and United Kingdom, Azerbaijani courts do not rely extensively on case law and judicial precedent. Except for decisions of the Constitutional Court of Azerbaijan, decisions of the courts are not usually counted as a source of law.Case Law in Azerbaijan The sources of law in the Azerbaijani legal system are:Sources of Azerbaijani law *The Constitution of Azerbaijan. *Acts adopted via referendum. *Laws passed by the National Assembly of Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan's legislature. *Decrees. *Resolutions of the Cabinet of Ministers. *International treaties to which Azerbaijan is a party.  Judicial system  The Supreme Court of Azerbaijan is a supreme judicial body on civil, criminal and other cases related to the execution of general and specialized courts. The Constitutional Court of Azerbaijan is the supreme body of constitutional justice on the matters attributed to its jurisdiction by the Constitution, with authority to interpret and apply the Constitution of Azerbaijan. The 1995 constitution provides for public trials in most cases, the presumption of innocence in criminal cases, and a defendant's right to legal counsel. Both defendants and prosecutors have the right of appeal. In practice, however, the courts are politically oriented, seeming to overlook the government's human rights violations. In July 1993, Heydar Aliyev ousted the Supreme Court chief justice because of alleged political loyalties to the opposition. The president directly appoints lower level judges. The president also appoints the Constitutional Court and Supreme Court judges with confirmation by the legislature. Prosecutors (procurators) are appointed by the president with confirmation by the legislature. The minister of justice organizes prosecutors into offices at the district, municipal, and republic levels. The constitution provides equal status for prosecutors and defense attorneys before the courts, but in practice the arrest and investigatory powers of the prosecutors have dominant influence before the courts. Judges will often remand a case for further prosecutory investigation rather than render an innocent verdict. Investigations often rely on obtaining confessions rather than on gathering evidence. The Azerbaijan government's human rights record is poor, although some public policy debate is allowed and human rights organizations operate. The government restricts freedom of assembly, religion, and association. Numerous cases of arbitrary arrest, beatings (some resulting in deaths), unwarranted searches and seizures, and other human rights abuses are reported. Political oppositionists are harassed and arrested, and there are dozens of political prisoners in Azerbaijan. The conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis contributed to widespread human rights violations by both sides. Some opposition newspapers are allowed to exist.  Legal Reforms  After gaining of independence Azerbaijani legal system has undergone fundamental reforms. An important part of the legal reforms in the country is related to adoption of a new Constitution in Azerbaijan in 1995. Since that Constitution was amended three times in 2002, 2009 and 2016. Adoption of the Constitution has been followed by reforms related to progressive legislative acts such as, \\"The Law on Constitutional court\\", \\"The Law on Courts and Judges\\", \\"The Law on Police\\", \\"The Law on Operational-investigational activity\\", Law Judicial Legal Council, Criminal and Civil Procedure Codes, etc. Moreover, there have been made a number of amendements to the Civil Code, the Code of Civil Procedure, the Criminal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure, etc.http://www.judicialcouncil.gov.az/e_mehkeme_ve_huquq.php Legal reforms introduced new three stage - first instance, appellate and supreme court system in Azerbaijan and ensured its independence from other branches of power. At present, there are district (city) courts acts as the first degree of jurisdictional courts, military courts and local administrative-economic courts as territorial jurisdictional courts, also Court of Azerbaijan Republic on Felonies and Court of Azerbaijan on Grave Military Crimes. The Supreme Court of Azerbaijan Republic is cassation degree of jurisdiction and consists of 4 chambers - Civil Chamber, Criminal Chamber, Military Chamber and Administrative-Economic Chamber. Court hearings are public, and defendants are free to choose their own attorney and have the right to appeal the verdict. In cases involving national security or other defined by law a judge may decide to hold a closed trial. Azerbaijan as a member of the Council of Europe ratificated European Convention on Human Rights .

History  Not much of the rich and great history of Manickpur is documented. It is only passed on through the generations by word of mouth. There are instances of this village in some old manuscripts. In some old Portuguese manuscripts, this place was called 'puri', although no explanation has been found on why it was called so. One of the assumptions is that earlier there might have been a temple on the lines of the Jagannath Temple in Puri in Orissa, and hence this place was named so. In Portuguese and English manuscripts this place was also referred to as porim. This name gradually changed to manickpuri, but there is no instance of any written documentation on this. It is also said that many South Indians settled here due to the proximity of Bombay (as it was earlier known) which was rich in terms of industries, mills, and factories. The name then gradually changed from Porim to Manickpurm. When the railway was laid by the British, the station that is now known as Vasai Road was then known as Manickpur Road. So it was through the British that the name changed to its present status. Actually the Vasai Road station was known as Bassein road after renaming Manickpur road. Still, the Indian railways refer Vasai Road as Bassein road, even the station indicators show this. Manickpur is situated on a hillock and the base is of stone; therefore, it is believed to have very strong foundations. Due to this, it has withstood many floods, and even earthquakes.  Inhabitants  The main inhabitants of the village of Manickpur can be sub- divided into four categories: Kunbi, Khumbar, Vadval, and Koli. Kunbis were the original inhabitants of this village. Starting from the Parvati Cross to the Chowk, Fadbao, Kharbao, Chinchkombda to Naupada is where these people originally built their houses. Almeida, Colaco, D'Mello, Lopes, Menezes are some of the surnames associated with these people. Khumbars lived across the Talao or the pond of Manickpur in line with the Church Road as the materials for making earthenware was easily found here. D'Souza, Gracias, Pereira, Alphanso are some of the surnames associated with Khumbars. Vadvals lived to the south of the church. This place was called Barampur. They were engrossed in agriculture and related activities. Ghosal, Carval, Vaz, Cerejo are some of the surnames associated with Vandals. Kolis lived along the creek and carried out the business of fishing. Shivachya Gharacha, Ghastya are some of the surnames associated with this community. The people of Barampur (the Vadvals) would marry people in the south of Vasai. Khumbars have their streak from Agashi to Marol. Kunbi's would find their spouses within the nearby villages of Chulne, Gokhivere, and mostly within Manickpur.  Allied occupations Even though Manickpur was built on stony land, there was sweet, semi-salty, and salty land around it. Similarly, there were Salt pans across it. The number of people of Manickpur actually working in the saltpans was very low, but those engaged in associated activities were high. Transportation of salt and the making of wooden covers for salt were some of the activities. Sutar- Ali (carpenters), Kumbhar-Ali (potters), and Kolis (fishing) were engaged in their traditional activities. The railway added to their source of income. Teachers, clerks, railway workers, welders, fitters, mechanics, etc. used to frequently travel to Mumbai by train.  History of St. Michael's Church  St. Michael's Church at Manickpur The Jesuits lived in the Vasai Fort and had the parishes of Papdy, Sandor and Manickpur in their control. Up to 1605, people from Manickpur used to go to Sandor to celebrate the Eucharistic. But since it was far, the priests established a chapel in Manickpur in 1606. This chapel was made out of wood and had toddy leaves thatched as the roof. Until 1608, priests from Sandor used to come and celebrate Mass and preach. Alexeo Menezes, Archbishop of Goa, then bifurcated the parishes of Manickpur and Sandor. The land used to build the chapel at Manickpur was donated by a Portuguese lady, Dona Ines Francisca, to the Jesuits in 1572. The Jesuits had to sell off the land for some reason unknown. It finally was bought by another Portuguese lady, Dona Philipa De Fonseca. She finally donated this land back to the Jesuits in her will when she died on 20 June 1625. Rev. Fr. Adrian D'silva started the building of the church, a task taken up by Rev. Fr. Manuel Perez and finally completed by Rev. Fr. Manuel D'costa. In 1739, Manickpur was raided by the Marathas, who came in through the east, led by Chimnaji Appa. They destroyed all the churches that were on their way to Vasai Fort, and Manickpur was one of them. However, it was later rebuilt in 1851 by Rev. Fr. E.R. Hull (a reference to this can be found in B.M.H Vol. 1.P.5) That year, the Jesuits fled the village and the diocesan priests took charge of the parish. They were in charge of the parish for almost 200 years, finally handing it over to the Jesuits in 1949. Since then, the Jesuits have run the parish.

Biography Like many designers, his background was in aeronautical engineering. He qualified at college with Bacalaur√©at Technique et Math√©matique and won his Degre Superieur after studying at the √âcole Nationale Technique d‚ÄôA√©ronautique. After leaving college, he joined Nord Aviation in 1964, where he worked on various missile projects. However, he became restless and applied for a job as a technician at Matra racing in December 1965. This was shortly after the creation of Matra-Sports and Ducarouge started work on their Formula 3 programme, and from 1966 he also began improving their Formula 2 cars. He steadily rose within the organisation to head of operations, where he designed the Cosworth-powered Matra MS10 and MS80, the latter winning the 1969 Formula One World Championship with Jackie Stewart; Ducarouge then masterminded Matra‚Äôs hat-trick of Le Mans wins from 1972‚Äì74. At the end of 1974, Matra pulled out of racing. Ducarouge resigned shortly after to begin work at the new Formula One team founded by Guy Ligier at Vichy, close to Gerard‚Äôs home town of Paray-le-Monial. He began work on Ligier‚Äôs entrant to the season, the JS5 which retained links with Matra including their 3-litre V12 engine and SEITA Gitanes brand sponsorship. By the Swedish Grand Prix of 1977 the team had celebrated its maiden Grand Prix victory. Subsequent victories were to occur throughout the season. In a revised Matra V12 was fitted in the latest Liger chassis and with Talbot backing it seemed as though the team would be contenders to win the constructors' championship. But by mid-season Ducarouge was unceremoniously sacked by Guy Ligier. He quickly accepted an offer to join the Alfa Romeo team where he persuaded the team to create his first carbon fibre chassis. Despite this and other innovations instigated by Ducarouge, Alfa Romeo failed to deliver on increasingly high expectations. Following the 1st qualifying session of the 1983 French Grand Prix where Andrea de Cesaris was disqualified for his car being underweight, Ducarouge was blamed and dismissed. He was not to remain out of work for long, as Peter Warr from Team Lotus head hunted Ducarouge. Lotus had witnessed a severe decline in fortunes following their dominant campaign, and had culminated with the death of their founder Colin Chapman in December 1982. Following extensive persuasion Ducarouge joined the team following the 1983 Belgian Grand Prix. He immediately began work on the Type 94T which was designed and built in five weeks, and helped salvage some degree of success for the remainder of the 1983 season. Team Lotus began a major restructuring headed by Ducarouge and culminated with the years 1984‚Äì87 representing a major revival of the team‚Äôs fortunes. In , Ducarouge's next Lotus, the 95T, was widely regarded as the finest handling chassis throughout the season with Elio de Angelis finishing third in the Drivers' Championship despite not winning a race, and teammate Nigel Mansell finishing tenth. Though de Angelis had a consistent season and finished in the points in the first 10 races of the season, he was a long way behind the dominant McLaren-TAGs of 1984 World Champion Niki Lauda and his teammate Alain Prost. The still born Lotus 96T Indy Car incorporated the innovative use of lightweight aluminium foil honeycomb in the chassis replacing the previous nomex construction. The gain of strength with no weight penalty was to become a hallmark of subsequent Lotus Formula 1 chassis. For the start of the season Ducarouge was joined at Lotus by Ayrton Senna. At the Portuguese Grand Prix held at a torrential Estoril, Senna would score his maiden win in a Ducarouge Lotus 97T. This was to be the first of seven and culminated in the 1987 victory in Detroit. His 1987 car, the Lotus 99T was the first Formula One car to be fitted with a computer-controlled active suspension system. Also, after four seasons of using the turbocharged Renault V6 engine, the 99T would use the powerful Honda V6 turbo. Senna, growing increasingly dissatisfied with Lotus' ability to build a championship contending car, would by the end of the season be unkindly referring to the 99T as nothing more than a 98T (the teams car) with a Honda engine instead of a Renault. The 99T was also visually more bulky than its competitors from Williams, Ferrari and McLaren. Senna would depart for McLaren for the start of the season leaving Ducarouge to develop and enter the much hoped landmark Lotus 100T. Despite the 100T using the same specification turbocharged Honda V6 engines as McLaren, the team only finished in fourth position and Lotus finished without a win for the first time since while McLaren would win a record 15 of the seasons 16 races, giving Ayrton Senna his first World Championship. The major faults of the 100T (driven in 1988 by reigning World Champion Nelson Piquet and Japanese driver Satoru Nakajima) were allegedly laid at incorrect aerodynamic data amassed during testing at Comtec, as well as the chassis being reported to be like \\"jelly on springs\\" and not rigid enough to handle the abrupt power delivery of Honda's engine. Ducarouge departed Lotus to return to France and take up an offer from the Larrousse team. At Larrousse he developed the Lola chassis with Chris Murphy (who would later join Lotus for the 1992 season), though results were few and far between with Larrousse using the somewhat unreliable Lamborghini V12 engine. In he rejoined Liger and remained as Technical Director until mid-1994. In the twilight of his career, Ducarouge retraced his career path back to Matra where he worked as the International development director on various projects, including the development of the Renault Espace F1. Ducarouge died on 19 February 2015 aged 73.

It is of Welsh origin and, as a personal name, was until recently usually given to boys. Meredith has many derivatives which have become personal names and surnames as well. Etymology and history In Old Welsh (c. 800-1150) the name was usually rendered as Morgetuid or Margetiud. The exact meaning of the first element, Mere, is unclear although some Welsh scholars have translated it as \\"great\\" or \\"splendid\\". The final element of iudd has the meaning of lord, and is found in other Welsh names such as Gruffydd and Bleidd[i]udd. However, in Middle Welsh (c. 1150s-1300s) the name was most commonly spelt as Maredud and Maredudd; \\"in Welsh, the accent is on the penult, and this leads at times to the elision of the vowel of the first syllable,\\" producing an early variant Mredydd, according to T.J. Morgan and Prys Morgan. Anglo-Norman scribes often used e for the first syllable and substituting the double d with a th, producing Mereduth. The forms Meredith and Meredyth are seen as early as the 14th century. In Medieval manuscripts, the name is frequently \\"disguised\\" in records produced by scribes unfamiliar with Welsh naming conventions, and has been confused with the Welsh name Moreiddig (which has produced Moredik, Moriddik and Morithik). By the early Middle Ages, the name took the form of Mereduc, in part due to \\"its suitability for taking Latin case-endings\\". The name has been rendered into Latin as Mereducco, Mereduci, Mereduth, Mereduco, Mereduc and Mereducus, Mereducius. In the dialect of Dyfed (Pembrokeshire) the final voiced interdental fricative (represented in writing by dd) was lost to produce the name Meredy. Though there is no etymological connection, Meredith has also been equated or associated with Merrick, Meyrick, and Moryce, \\"presumably on the basis of the 'Mer', although it is possible that Maurice was adopted as an approximation,\\" according to Morgan and Morgan. Various forms of the name include Maredith, Maradyth, Merddith, Merydethe, Mredith, Maready, and Redith. The surname \\"Merediz\\", found in the northern coastal region of Spain, particularly Asturias, is derived from it. The surname is also found in Argentina and Mexico. Derivatives A derivative or pet name of Meredith is Bedo, which has given rise to a variety of other surnames, including: Beddas, Beddis, Beddus, Beddose, Beddos, Beddoe, Beddoes, Beddowe, Beado, Beddah, Beddow, Beddas, Beddass, with a deliberate anglicisation of Beddis/Beddus into Bedhouse. The forms Beddoe, Beddow, Beddoes, and Beddowes are particularly common within the Shropshire region of the Marches. The hardening characteristic of the Glamorgan and Monmouthshire accent mutated the d into t, producing Bettoe and Bettoes with the anglicised variant as Betthouse.

He went on the stage at an early age, traveled to Sydney and spent eight years in Australian light opera, performing as Willie Bevan. He sailed to America with the Pollard‚Äôs Lilliputian Opera Company in 1912, and later toured Canada. Bevan broke into films with the Sigmund Lubin studio in 1916. When the company disbanded, Bevan became a supporting actor in Mack Sennett movie comedies. An expressive pantomimist, Bevan's quiet scene-stealing attracted attention, and by 1922 Bevan was a Sennett star. He supplemented his income, however, by establishing a citrus and avocado farm at Escondido, California. Usually filmed wearing a derby hat and a drooping mustache, Bevan may not have possessed an indelible screen character like Charlie Chaplin but he had a friendly, funny presence in the frantic Sennett comedies. Much of the comedy depended on Bevan's skilled timing and reactions; the famous \\"oyster\\" routine performed on film by Curly Howard, Lou Costello, and Huntz Hall‚Äîin which a bowl of \\"fresh oyster stew\\" shows alarming signs of life and battles the guy trying to eat it‚Äîwas originated on film decades earlier by Bevan in the short film Wandering Willies. By the mid-1920s Bevan was often teamed with Andy Clyde; Clyde soon graduated to his own starring series. The late 1920s found Bevan playing in wild marital farces for Sennett. The advent of talking pictures took their toll on the careers of many silent stars, including Billy Bevan. Bevan began a second career in \\"talkies\\" as a character actor and bit player in roles such as that of a bus driver in the 1929 film High Voltage, a hotel employee in the Mae Murray film Peacock Alley, and the supporting role of Second Lieutenant Trotter in Journey's End in 1930. His starring roles had come to an end, however, and for the next 20 years he often would play rowdy Cockneys (as in Pack Up Your Troubles with The Ritz Brothers), and affable Englishmen (as in Tin Pan Alley and Terror by Night).Anthony Slide (2012), Hollywood Unknowns: A History of Extras, Bit Players, and Stand-Ins P.162, University Press of Mississippi. . Slide also notes this of Clyde Cook He played a friendly bus conductor opposite Greer Garson in one of the opening scenes of Mrs. Miniver. Bevan died in 1957 in Escondido, California, just before new audiences discovered him in Robert Youngson's silent-comedy compilations. The Youngson films mispronounce his name as \\"Be-VAN\\"; Bevan himself offered the proper pronunciation in a Voice of Hollywood reel in 1930.

Born in Paris, the son of a parliamentary lawyer, Ameil entered the army as a simple infantryman on July 14, 1789. He would subsequently rise through every rank in the army. In 1805 he was made squadron commander of a cavalry company in Marshal Bernadotte's army. He then participated in the German, Polish, and Russian campaigns. On July 12, 1809, he was named colonel of the 24th Chasseurs de Cheval [Light Cavalry] Regiment,Broughton, Tony \\"French Chasseur-a-Cheval Regiments and the Colonels Who Led Them 1791-1815: 21e - 31e Regiments \\" Accessed September 1, 2007. and on November 21, 1812 he was made a Brigade General. After the abdication of Napoleon in 1814, Ameil accepted the restored Bourbon regime and was made a Knight of the Order of Saint Louis. He then accompanied the Count of Artois (Charles X) to Lyon, with orders to stop Napoleon's advance. However, the army deserted en masse to Napoleon's side, and when the Count retreated for Paris, Ameil pledged himself to Napoleon. He was sent to Auxerre, but was intercepted by royalist forces and sent as a prisoner to Paris on the same day that Napoleon victoriously entered the Tuileries Palace. Upon regaining his liberty, Ameil took part in the formation of Napoleon's army. Hedging somewhat, he sent a letter to Louis XVIII on the day of the Battle of Waterloo for the purpose of justifying his conduct. The letter was not persuasive: court martial proceedings against him were soon begun. To escape, Ameil travelled to England, later travelling to Hannover with the intention of reaching Sweden and the protection of Bernadotte. However, he was arrested in L√ºneburg and transferred to Hildesheim as a prisoner of the state. Accused of high treason, on November 15, 1816 he was condemned to death by court martial. However, the sentence was not carried out, and on July 25, 1821 he was pardoned by a royal decree and his titles, rights, honors, and rank were restored. On October 24, 1821, he retired. The following year, he died in Paris, on the same day that he was named a Commander of the Legion of Honor by Louis XVIII. By this time he was also a Knight of the Order of Saint Hubert of Bavaria and of the Royal Swedish Order of the Sword. References *Mulli√©, Charles. \\"Auguste Jean Ameil\\".

The film was directed by Edward L. Cahn, and stars Richard Denning, Joan Taylor, and Mae Marsh. American International Pictures released the film as a double feature with Hot Rod Girl.Gary A. Smith, American International Pictures: The Golden Years, Bear Manor Media 2014 p 32 Plot Anne Carson (Joan Taylor) is sent to a women's prison for allegedly participating in a bank robbery with two others, one, Paul Anderson (Lance Fuller) who is still at large. The money was never recovered and all eyes are on Anne who denies knowing about the money. On arrival in prison, Anne meets the outwardly tough matron in charge (Jane Darwell) and the prison chaplain Rev Fulton (Richard Denning) who feels Anne may have had a mistrial and does not belong in prison. Anne's cellmates are Jenny (Adele Jergens) who seems to run the inmates, Melanee (Helen Gilbert) who makes a play for Anne and Dorothy (Phyllis Coates) a woman who has murdered her own husband and child when he ran away with another woman who is still alive. The unhinged Dorothy believes her child is still alive and every new girl in prison is her husband's lover, Lois. Jenny and Melanee team up in the \\"good cop/bad cop\\" routine to get Anne to tell them where the money is with Melanee telling Dorothy that Anne is really Lois. On the outside, Paul is using blackmail and threats on Anne's ex-criminal father Pop Carson (Raymond Hatton) to find the money as well as offering to split it with him 50/50. Anne faces attempted murder by Dorothy, threats on her life from two other inmates seeking the money, and fights Melanee in a catfight that culminates in a mud puddle. When a large earthquake hits the area and demolishes the installation, Jenny (who has acquired a pistol from her outside contacts) and the outwardly harmless trustee Grandma (Mae Marsh) and Melanee use the opportunity to escape with Anne to take her home to locate the money. The downed telephone and power lines give the three girls time to escape unpursued but Rev Fulton heads off Anne at her home, where Pop is still held at gunpoint by Paul. Since the film's release in 1956, the theatrical movie poster, featuring a catfight between Helen Gilbert and Joan Taylor, has become a collector's item. The poster shows the blonde haired Gilbert strangling the dark haired Taylor although that exact scene did not occur in the movie.Halperin, James L. (ed.)

Her task was to carry stores, refrigerated items, and equipment to ships in the fleet, and to remote stations and staging areas. She served during the entire Vietnam War and returned home proudly with numerous battle stars and commendations. The third ship to be named Vega by the Navy, AF-59 was laid down on 7 June 1954 at Pascagoula, Mississippi, by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp.; launched on 28 April 1955; sponsored by Mrs. Theodore C. Lonnquest; and commissioned on 10 November 1955, Capt. Floyd T. Thompson in command.  Pacific Ocean deployment  Following shakedown, Vega sailed for the U.S. West Coast and duty with the U.S. Pacific Fleet. Between January 1956 and mid-1964, Vega made 13 deployments to the Far East, usually about four months in length. During this time, the versatile storeship sailed an average of over 30,000 miles per year and routinely visited Yokosuka and Sasebo, Japan; Hong Kong; Subic Bay, Philippines; and Kaohsiung, Formosa, with an occasional run to Kobe and Iwakuni, Japan. In 1956, Vega set a record for ships of her type when she provisioned Shangri-La (CVA-38) at a rate of 218 tons per hour. In 1963, the Vega again proved herself to be the Navy's fastest working storeship as she delivered 117 tons of provisions to Ranger (CVA-61) in just 27 minutes, giving her a transfer rate of 245 tons per hour.  Vietnam operations  From October 1964 to January 1965, Vega participated in Fleet operations off the coast of Vietnam before she returned to the United States in February 1965. Returning to Vietnamese waters in the late spring, she once more supported U.S. 7th Fleet units.  Change of command at sea  While underway in the South China Sea on 8 September 1965, Vega was the scene of an unusual change of command, when Capt. T. A. Melusky relieved Capt. R. E. Hill as commanding officer. The ceremony took place at 0128, on the port wing of the bridge, by the light of red-filtered flashlights, with the ship darkened during an underway replenishment of Constellation (CVA-64). The storeship returned to the United States in October 1965. Vega was again deployed to the 7th Fleet from February to May 1966. During this time, the ship replenished her first two nuclear-powered ships, Bainbridge (DLGN-25) and Enterprise (CVAN-65).  Visiting Vietnamese ports  Later, during her next WestPac tour, Vega conducted 125 underway and 26 in-port replenishments‚Äîmore than during any other deployment. Besides her normal Japanese ports of call, she also visited Danang and An Thoi, Vietnam, while calling for the first time at Singapore.  Supporting Operation Market Time  As American involvement in Vietnam deepened, Vega's deployment schedule reflected this increase in operations. While deployed in the summer of 1966, Vega steamed in company with Hector (AR-7), Ashtabula (AO-51), Paricutin (AE-18), and Currituck (AV-7). From 22 August to 21 November, she supported ships operating on Yankee Station and Operation Market Time.  Based out of San Francisco  She remained thus employed, with regular deployments to WestPac through 1969. In between her deployments to the \\"Yankee-Station\\" or to \\"Market-Time\\" zones, Vega maintained a regular schedule of local operations, overhauls, and refresher training upon return to the west coast. Homeported at San Francisco, California, Vega continued her unglamorous but vital duty of providing the necessary supplies to keep the Fleet and its men in top operating condition. After loading at Oakland, California, from 24 March to 4 April 1969, Vega sailed on 5 April for Yokosuka, Japan.  American EC-121 plane shot down  Her normal routine of operations was interrupted later that month, when North Korean MiG fighters shot down an American EC-121 surveillance aircraft over the Sea of Japan. As tensions rose between Pyongyang and Washington, D.C., the 7th Fleet responded to the crisis by dispatching a task force which included the nuclear attack carrier Enterprise to the vicinity. Vega joined Task Group (TG) 73.7 on 24 April in support of Task Force (TF) 71 in the Sea of Japan and performed 17 underway replenishments between the 24th and the 29th. With the relaxation of tensions, Vega was detached on the latter date and resumed her regular WestPac replenishment operations to the 7th Fleet. Vega began her first line period for 1969 on 9 May and replenished 22 ships before returning to Subic Bay on the 16th. On 31 May, the refrigerator ship commenced a 37-hour replenishment operation with Niagara Falls (AFS-3) in Subic Bay, delivering some 1,057.5 tons of provisions.  Continued support of Market Time  On 9 June, Vega got underway to support \\"Market Time\\" operations. She replenished in port at An Thoi on 13 June, at Vung Tau on the 15th, Camranh Bay on the 16th, and at Danang on the 17th, before carrying out nine underway replenishments on \\"Yankee Station,\\" over the next six days. Returning to Subic Bay on 27 June, the ship remained there until 6 July, when she sailed for Yankee Station‚Äîas bad weather had grounded all COD (carrier onboard delivery) aircraft, and supplies needed to be delivered to the Fleet. She arrived on station on 8 July and, alongside Oriskany (CVA-34) four days later, conducted her longest underway replenishment, from 1737 on 12 July to 0105 on the 13th‚Äîa period of seven hours and 28 minutes.  Assigned SOPA duties in Hong Kong  Soon thereafter, Vega shifted to Hong Kong, where her commanding officer became the administrative Senior Officer Present Afloat (SOPA) on 23 July. She and Rowan (DD-782) got underway on the 27th to avoid typhoon Viola which was then swirling its way up the China coast. Returning two days later, Vega resumed her SOPA duties and continued to carry them out until she departed that port on 8 August, bound for Sasebo. There, the supply ship loaded Fleet freight and soon sailed for the west coast of the United States, arriving at San Francisco, California, on 5 September, where she remained for the rest of 1969.  1970 Stateside overhaul  After entering the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard on 2 January 1970 for her regular overhaul, Vega spent three months in dockyard hands before she emerged on 2 April to commence refresher training out of San Diego, California. She trained in the southern California operating area into the summer, before shifting on 21 August to the Army Refrigerator (Reefer) Piers at Oakland, California. There, she conducted a pre-deployment loadout of goods for shipment to the western Pacific.  Return to WestPac  Vega replenishing and off Vietnam. Vega again got underway on 11 September, bound for Subic Bay, and crossed the 160th meridian east on 26 September to commence officially her WestPac tour. After evading typhoon \\"Hope\\" en route, Vega stopped briefly at Subic Bay before she pressed on, on 8 October for her first line tour of the deployment on Yankee Station off the coast of Vietnam. She returned to Subic on 22 October. During this tour, she transferred over 226 tons of foodstuffs during underway replenishments. Her second line period saw the ship transfer 290 tons of provisions to ships with task force TF 77 on Yankee Station. Bangkok, Thailand, provided welcome relief for liberty parties before the ship returned to the line a third time on 29 November. Operating in support of \\"Market Time,\\" Vega transferred some 392 tons of food -- Christmas supplies‚Äîto ships engaged in the daily interdiction patrols of the sea lanes. Further, the ship delivered some 67 tons of supplies to Danang, Camranh Bay, Con Son, An Thoi, and Hon Choi‚Äîall in South Vietnam. After visiting Hong Kong from 13 to 21 December, Vega spent Christmas at Kaohsiung, Taiwan, and then returned to Subic Bay to load supplies. Before the year was out, the supply ship was underway again‚Äîfor her fourth line period off Vietnam. During this swing, the ship transferred 300 tons of food to ships on \\"Yankee Station\\" and \\"Market Time\\" patrols. Many sailors on the ships she supplied probably enjoyed the fresh fruit acquired on Taiwan during the ship's visit there prior to deploying off the Vietnam coastline.  Serving the troops through difficult weather  The supply vessel conducted two more swings on the patrol line in the sea lanes off Vietnam into early 1971. Extremely difficult weather conditions hampered such operations on 29 and 30 January 1971, but the men on the ships involved rose to the occasion and accomplished the successful transfer of 100 tons of food without incident. Offloading 342 tons of supplies at the Naval Supply Depot, Subic Bay, from 8 to 10 March, the ship departed the Philippines to visit Japan. While en route, however, Vega was dispatched to search for a Japanese fishing vessel in distress off Yonakuni Jima. Conducting the search in heavy seas and beneath leaden grey overcast skies, Vega's efforts were uncrowned with success, as she found no trace of the distressed ship. Vega eventually visited Sasebo, from 17 to 20 March, before she got underway for Pearl Harbor, en route to her ultimate destination of Alameda, California.  Serving as host ship and attending the Sea Fair  Making port at the Naval Air Station, Alameda, on 6 April, Vega later served from 13 to 17 May as host ship at San Francisco for HMCS Terra Nova. Vega then entered Triple \\"A\\" Shipyard, San Francisco, on 27 May for a restricted availability which increased the ship's transfer capabilities. Completing these modifications on 23 July, the ship conducted a program of type training off the California coast from the 26th through the 30th, before she sailed north to call at the annual Sea Fair at Seattle, Washington. During a subsequent refit, again carried out at San Francisco's Triple \\"A\\" Shipyard in the summer and again in the fall of 1971, Vega received modifications that further improved her cargo-handling capacities. Specifically, number 3 hold was modified to handle pre-palletized cargo; and existing helicopter facilities were upgraded. In addition, a 4,000-pound pallet conveyor belt was added, as well as battery-charging facilities and a new forklift garage. In between yard periods, the cargo vessel participated in local operations and type training exercises.  Vietnam operations coming to a close  From 1972 through 1974, Vega continued fulfilling her primary mission of supplying units afloat and ashore with necessary food and cargo. She regularly deployed to the far reaches of the western Pacific operating area and conducted replenishments to ships at sea on \\"Yankee Station\\" and \\"Market Time\\" patrols and carried out support operations with the Mobile Logistics Support Force. The tempo of the Vietnam war, however, began to change. By the spring of 1973, American involvement on the southeast Asian mainland was drawing to a close.  Evacuation of Cambodian refugees  After deploying to the line three times in early 1975, Vega sailed from Subic Bay early in March 1975, to provide logistics services for task group TG 76.4, standing by in the Gulf of Thailand to execute Operation Eagle Pull, the evacuation of Cambodian refugees fleeing the communist takeover of that country. She conducted replenishment operations with a wide variety of ships. Returning to Subic Bay to reload on 31 March, she set sail for the second increment of \\"Eagle Pull,\\" rejoining the forces in the Gulf of Thailand on 5 April. After conducting replenishments with Frederick (LST-1184), Durham (LKA-114), Long Beach (CLGN-9), Reasoner (DE1063), Blue Ridge (LLC-19), Okinawa (LPH-3), and Thomaston (LSD-28), she arrived at Phu Quoc Island to provide supply support for Cambodian refugees, and transferred some 12.4 tons of refugee subsistence items to Dubuque (LPD-8) and Peoria (LST-1183). Rendezvousing with TG 76.4 on the 9th, the busy supply vessel again returned to Phu Quoc on the 10th and to Subic Bay on the 13th.  Operation Frequent Wind activity  Underway from Subic Bay on 23 April, Vega sailed for the coast of South Vietnam. By this juncture, the government of South Vietnam was collapsing, leaving tons of American-supplied equipment intact for the communist forces. Operation Frequent Wind was launched to evacuate Americans, at-risk Vietnamese and third country nationals, lest they be left behind and fall into communist hands. For the next few days, Vega replenished United States and South Vietnamese Navy ships, delivered passengers and mail, and transferred refugee supplies to vessels loaded with fleeing South Vietnamese. Underway at sea from 25 to 30 April, the supply ship arrived off Vung Tau on 1 May and replenished South Vietnamese naval units YFU-69, HQ-3, HQ-800, and HQ-801 as well as conducted a vertical fleet supply replenishment with Mars (AFS-1) and fleet supplies and mail for five other Navy ships. Heading for Subic Bay, Vega served as escort for the \\"New Life\\" flotilla, heavily laden with Vietnamese refugees and their belongings. Arriving at Subic Bay on the 6th, she stood in with the first contingent of refugee vessels‚Äîsome 70 craft in all, of all shapes and sizes. Underway for a resumption of escort duties later that day, Vega stood out to sea; she subsequently refueled from Taluga (T-AO-62) on the 7th before conducting underway replenishments over the next two days with Midway (CVA-41), Badger (DE-1071), and Ashtabula (AO-51). Arriving at Subic Bay on 10 May to load supplies, she got underway soon thereafter, in company with Harold E. Holt (DE-1074), for refugee vessel escort duties.  Recapture of the SS Mayaguez  On 13 May, Khmer Rouge forces seized the American-owned container ship, SS Mayaguez, off Koh Tang Island, Cambodia. Both Vega and Harold E. Holt made full speed ahead for the area, while American forces soon mobilized to gain the release of the ship and its crew from the hands of the Cambodians. Arriving on the 15th, Vega stood by to provide services while Harold E. Holt moved in and delivered a detachment of the 1st Battalion 4th Marines , who boarded the container ship. While the incident was brought to a conclusion by the swift recapture of the ship and her crew, the routine task of conducting underway replenishments to ships of the 7th Fleet in southeast Asian waters continued unabated in the wake of the fall of Vietnam and Cambodia.  Post-Vietnam War operations  Vega and in the Gulf of Tonkin, March 1975. Vega returned to San Francisco, California, on 4 August, following a circuitous route via Cebu and Subic Bay, Philippines; Hong Kong, British Crown Colony; Buckner Bay, Okinawa; and Pearl Harbor. A tally of the ships' activities on her most eventful WestPac cruise showed the ship to have completed some 105 underway, 15 boat, and 38 vertical replenishments -‚Äî the last utilizing the capabilities of helicopters for rapid and increased transport of supplies from ship to ship. A total of some 2,848.9 tons of provisions, including 136.8 tons of refugee supplies, were transferred. The ship then underwent restricted availability from 18 to 19 August. For the remainder of the ship's active service career with the United States Navy, Vega operated off the U.S. West Coast, conducting local operations, and later deployed to the Philippines, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, and Okinawa for her final WestPac deployment. She arrived at San Francisco on 21 December 1976 and immediately commenced leave and upkeep.  Inactivation and decommissioning  On 21 January 1977, Vega shifted to berth 23 south, Mare Island Naval Shipyard, to commence standdown prior to inactivation. She was decommissioned on 29 April 1977 and struck from the Navy list the same day.  Military awards and honors  Vega earned 10 battle stars for her service to units of the 7th Fleet during the Vietnam war: * Vietnamese Defense * Vietnamese Counteroffensive * Vietnamese Counteroffensive - Phase II * Vietnamese Counteroffensive - Phase III * Vietnamese Counteroffensive - Phase IV * Vietnamese Counteroffensive - Phase V * Tet/69 Counteroffensive * Vietnam Summer-Fall 1969 * Vietnamese Counteroffensive - Phase VI * Vietnam Ceasefire Vega‚Äôs crew was eligible for the following medals and commendations: * Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation (2) * National Defense Service Medal * Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal (7-Vietnam, 2-Quemoy-Matsu, 1-Korea, 1-Op.

During the Apollo program, McKay provided geology training to the first men to walk on the Moon in the late 1960s. McKay was the first author of a scientific paper postulating past life on Mars on the basis of evidence in Martian meteorite ALH 84001, which had been found in Antarctica.Science, August 16, 1996 This paper has become one of the most heavily cited papers in planetary science. The NASA Astrobiology Institute was founded partially as a result of community interest in this paper and related topics. He was a native of Titusville, Pennsylvania.http://universalium.academic.ru/252574/McKay,_David_Stewart Apollo program As a graduate student in geology at Rice University, McKay was present at John F. Kennedy's speech in 1962 The text of the speech, 12 September 1962. Note that Dr McKay posted a note on this wikipage's Talk Page, saying that he was in the audience. However, Dr McKay gave the date as 1961. announcing the goal of landing a man on the Moon within the decade. Inspired by Kennedy's speech, McKay as a NASA scientist trained the Apollo astronauts in geology. He was a chief trainer for Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin during their last geology field trip in West Texas. On July 20, 1969 in Houston, McKay was the only geologist present in the Apollo Mission Control Room when Armstrong and Aldrin walked on the Moon, serving as a resource. He was named principal investigator to study the samples which they brought back from the Moon.Obituary, Aviation Week & Space Technology, 4/11 March 2013 issue, p. 13 Lunar dust McKay studied lunar dust since the return of the first Apollo 11 samples in 1969, and contributed over 200 publications on this topic. As a result of this effort, McKay contributed to major discoveries, including: *Source of vapor deposition on lunar soil grains *Formation of nano-phase iron globules on lunar soil grains *Processes on the Moon that contribute to grain size distribution *Space weathering and chemically activated nature of in-situ lunar dust. Space resources and planetary materials McKay published numerous papers and abstracts relating to planetary materials and space resource utilization: lunar regolith, cosmic dust, meteorites, Martian soil analogs, and technologies for producing oxygen, water, and building materials from lunar soil. Lunar simulants The engineering simulant JSC-1 was developed by McKay, James Carter of The University of Texas at Dallas, and others. Martian microfossils McKay's team published their findings in 1996 regarding possible microfossil structures in Martian meteorite ALH 84001. McKay presented more than 100 talks at scientific and public gatherings on the possibility of life on Mars and the implications of that possibility. Contributions to medical science McKay's research group conducted studies of nanobacteria, tiny life forms such as might be found in extraterrestrial environments. McKay's group was also part of a pioneering study on the effects of lunar dust on health. Using one of the largest returned Apollo regolith samples released to scientists, the research team separated and studied the tiniest sized lunar dust particles.

It is now a member of the main opposition NASA. 2007 elections The present Wiper Democratic Movement, originally known as ODM-Kenya was created as a result a split between Kalonzo Musyoka and Raila Odinga in mid-August 2007.\\"Opposition in Kenya splits in two\\", BBC News, August 15, 2007 Raila's group, which also included Musalia Mudavadi, William Ruto, Joseph Nyagah and Najib Balala bought out the original ODM party from Mugambi Imanyara, while Kalonzo's group, consisting of himself and Dr. Julia Ojiambo remained in the shell of the party. The two factions held their elections for presidential candidate on consecutive days at the Kasarani sports complex in Nairobi. On 31 August 2007, Kalonzo Musyoka defeated Julia Ojiambo for the ODM‚ÄìKenya ticket. On September 1 Raila Odinga was selected the ODM presidential candidate. Raila and Kalonzo faced president Kibaki in the general election. Kalonzo took a distant third place, but in January 2008 he became vice-president of Kenya under Kibaki, whose victory was disputed by Raila Odinga and the ODM. Following the 2007-2008 Kenyan crisis,which resulted in a great loss of life, a government of national unity was formed between Kibaki's PNU and Odinga's ODM, with Musyoka retaining his position as vice-president. So far, Musyoka is one of two Wiper Democratic Movement politicians in the cabinet, with Mutula Kilonzo as Minister for Justice and Constitutional Affairs, as his faction received very little support in the parliamentary election.

Goal and result The reform gave each county their own university college, except for the two Agder counties, who shared one. Some counties have more than one, with M√∏re og Romsdal and Nordland topping with three each. The university colleges were given the main responsibility for training nurses, teachers, preschool teachers, engineers and business administrators. In addition a number of other tasks were included in the colleges portfolio. The goal of the reform, that was initiated by the then Minister of Education, Gudmund Hernes from the Labour Party, was to effectivate the operations at the colleges through economy of scale. Herned had led the public committee that in 1988 had launched the idea of merging and co locating the colleges. The idea was to use teaching resources dedicated to academic administration instead to be used for teaching and research. An evaluation of the reform after five years concluded that reform had not succeeded and that the resulting more efficient operations came from lower state subsidies instead of more efficient operations. It also showed that the reform gave the educational personnel more administrative work. Other processes Two years later the Norwegian University of Science and Technology was created in Trondheim after a merger of the Norwegian Institute of Technology and the University of Trondheim, reducing the number of public colleges and universities in Trondheim from thirteen to two.

There is a wide variety of types differing in the construction of their wings, aerodynamic efficiency, location of the pilot, controls and intended purpose. Most exploit meteorological phenomena to maintain or gain height. Gliders are principally used for the air sports of gliding, hang gliding and paragliding. However some spacecraft have been designed to descend as gliders and in the past military gliders have been used in warfare. Some simple and familiar types of glider are toys such as paper planes and balsa wood gliders. Etymology Glider is the agent noun form of the verb to glide. It derives from Middle English gliden, which in turn derived from Old English glƒ´dan. The oldest meaning of glide may have denoted a precipitous running or jumping, as opposed to a smooth motion. Scholars are uncertain as to its original derivation, with possible connections to \\"slide\\", and \\"light\\" having been advanced.Liberman, Anatoly. \\"An Addendum to ‚ÄúTen Scandinavian and North English Etymologies‚Äù\\", from alv√≠ssm√°l 7. 1997. 101‚Äì4. History Early pre-modern accounts of flight are in most cases difficult to verify and it is unclear whether each craft was a glider, kite or parachute and to what degree they were truly controllable. Often the event is only recorded a long time after it allegedly took place. A 17th-century account reports an attempt at flight by the 9th-century poet Abbas Ibn Firnas near Cordoba, Spain which ended in heavy back injuries.Lynn Townsend White, Jr. (Spring, 1961) \\"Eilmer of Malmesbury, an Eleventh Century Aviator: A Case Study of Technological Innovation, Its Context and Tradition\\", Technology and Culture 2 (2), pp. 97‚Äì111 [100‚Äì101]. The monk Eilmer of Malmesbury is reported by William of Malmesbury (c. 1080‚Äì1143), a fellow monk and historian, to have flown off the roof of his Abbey in Malmesbury, England, sometime between 1000 and 1010 AD, gliding about before crashing and breaking his legs.White, L., Jr., Eilmer of Malmesbury, an Eleventh Century Aviator. Medieval Religion and Technology. Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1978, Chapter 4. According to these reports, both used a set of (feathery) wings, and both blamed their crash on the lack of a tail.Lynn Townsend White, Jr. (Spring, 1961). \\"Eilmer of Malmesbury, an Eleventh Century Aviator: A Case Study of Technological Innovation, Its Context and Tradition\\", Technology and Culture 2 (2), pp. 97‚Äì111 [98 & 101].

Thereafter gliders were built by pioneers such as Jean Marie Le Bris, John J. Montgomery, Otto Lilienthal, Percy Pilcher, Octave Chanute and Augustus Moore Herring to develop aviation. Lilienthal was the first to make repeated successful flights (eventually totaling over 2,000) and was the first to use rising air to prolong his flight. Using a Montgomery tandem-wing glider, Daniel Maloney was the first to demonstrate high-altitude controlled flight using a balloon-launched glider launched from 4,000 feet in 1905.Harwood, Craig S. and Fogel, Gary B. Quest for Flight: John J. Montgomery and the Dawn of Aviation in the West, University of Oklahoma Press 2012. The Wright Brothers developed a series of three manned gliders after preliminary tests with a kite as they worked towards achieving powered flight. They returned to glider testing in 1911 by removing the motor from one of their later designs. Development In the inter-war years, recreational gliding flourished in Germany under the auspices of Rh√∂n-Rossitten. In the United States, the Schweizer brothers of Elmira, New York, manufactured sport sailplanes to meet the new demand. Sailplanes continued to evolve in the 1930s, and sport gliding has become the main application of gliders. As their performance improved, gliders began to be used to fly cross-country and now regularly fly hundreds or even over a thousand of kilometers in a day, if the weather is suitable. Military gliders were developed during World War II by a number of countries for landing troops. A glider ‚Äì the Colditz Cock ‚Äì was even built secretly by POWs as a potential escape method at Oflag IV-C near the end of the war in 1944. Smallest glider in the world - BrO-18 \\"Boru≈æƒó\\" (Ladybird), constructed in Lithuania in 1975 Development of flexible-wing hang gliders Foot- launched aircraft had been flown by Lilienthal and at the meetings at Wasserkuppe in the 1920s. However the innovation that led to modern hang gliders was in 1951 when Francis Rogallo and Gertrude Rogallo applied for a patent for a fully flexible wing with a stiffening structure. The American space agency NASA began testing in various flexible and semi-rigid configurations of this Rogallo wing in 1957 in order to use it as a recovery system for the Gemini space capsules. Charles Richards and Paul Bikle developed the concept producing a wing that was simple to build which was capable of slow flight and as gentle landing. Between 1960 and 1962 Barry Hill Palmer used this concept to make foot-launched hang gliders, followed in 1963 by Mike Burns who built a kite-hang glider called Skiplane. In 1963, John W. Dickenson began commercial production.The F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale Hang Gliding Diploma (2006) for the invention of the modern hang glider: FAI Award: The FAI Hang Gliding Diploma Development of paragliders January 10, 1963 American Domina Jalbert filed a patent US Patent 3131894 on the Parafoil which had sectioned cells in an aerofoil shape; an open leading edge and a closed trailing edge, inflated by passage through the air ‚Äì the ram-air design. The 'Sail Wing' was developed further for recovery of NASA space capsules by David Barish. Testing was done by using ridge lift. After tests on Hunter Mountain, New York in September 1965, he went on to promote \\"slope soaring\\" as a summer activity for ski resorts (apparently without great success).David Barish, The Forgotten Father of Paragliding NASA originated the term \\"paraglider\\" in the early 1960s, and ‚Äòparagliding‚Äô was first used in the early 1970s to describe foot-launching of gliding parachutes. Although their use is mainly recreational, unmanned paragliders have also been built for military applications e.g. Atair Insect. Recreational types Gunma, Japan. The main application today of glider aircraft is sport and recreation. Sailplane Gliders were developed from the 1920s for recreational purposes. As pilots began to understand how to use rising air, gliders were developed with a high lift-to-drag ratio. These allowed longer glides to the next source of 'lift', and so increase their chances of flying long distances. This gave rise to the popular sport known as gliding although the term can also be used to refer to merely descending flight. Such gliders designed for soaring are sometimes called sailplanes. Gliders were mainly built of wood and metal but the majority now have composite materials using glass, carbon fibre and aramid fibers. To minimise drag, these types have a fuselage and long narrow wings, i.e. a high aspect ratio. In the beginning, there were huge differences in the appearance of early-sailplanes. As technology and materials developed, the aspiration for the perfect balance between lift/drag, climbing ratio and gliding speed, made engineers from various producers create similar designs across the world. Both single-seat and two-seat gliders are available. Initially training was done by short 'hops' in primary gliders which are very basic aircraft with no cockpit and minimal instruments.Schweizer, Paul A: Wings Like Eagles, The Story of Soaring in the United States, pages 14‚Äì22. Smithsonian Institution Press, 1988. Since shortly after World War II training has always been done in two- seat dual control gliders, but high performance two-seaters are also used to share the workload and the enjoyment of long flights. Originally skids were used for landing, but the majority now land on wheels, often retractable. Some gliders, known as motor gliders, are designed for unpowered flight, but can deploy piston, rotary, jet or electric engines. Gliders are classified by the FAI for competitions into glider competition classes mainly on the basis of span and flaps. Ultralight \\"airchair\\" Sandlin Goat 1 glider A class of ultralight sailplanes, including some known as microlift gliders and some as 'airchairs', has been defined by the FAI based on a maximum weight. They are light enough to be transported easily, and can be flown without licensing in some countries. Ultralight gliders have performance similar to hang gliders, but offer some additional crash safety as the pilot can be strapped in an upright seat within a deformable structure. Landing is usually on one or two wheels which distinguishes these craft from hang gliders. Several commercial ultralight gliders have come and gone, but most current development is done by individual designers and home builders. Hang gliders Modern 'flexible wing' hang glider. Unlike a sailplane, a hang glider is capable of being carried, foot launched and landed solely by the use of the pilot's legs. * In the original and still most common designs, Class 1, the pilot is suspended from the center of the flexible wing and controls the aircraft by shifting his/her weight. * Class 2 (designated by the FAI as Sub-Class O-2) have a rigid primary structure with movable aerodynamic surfaces, such as spoilers, as the primary method of control. The pilot is often enclosed by means of a fairing. These offer the best performance and are the most expensive. * Class 4 hang gliders are unable to demonstrate consistent ability to safely take-off and/or land in nil-wind conditions, but otherwise are capable of being launched and landed by the use of the pilot's legs. * Class 5 hang gliders have a rigid primary structure with movable aerodynamic surfaces as the primary method of control and can safely take-off and land in nil-wind conditions. No pilot fairings are permitted. In a hang glider the shape of the wing is determined by a structure, and it is this that distinguishes them from the other main type of foot-launched aircraft, paragliders, technically Class 3. Some hang gliders have engines, and are known as powered hang gliders. Due to their commonality of parts, construction and design, they are usually considered by aviation authorities to be hang gliders, even though they may use the engine for the entire flight. Some flexible wing powered aircraft, Ultralight trikes, have a wheeled undercarriage, and so are not hang gliders. Paragliders A paraglider taking off in Brazil A paraglider is a free- flying, foot-launched aircraft. The pilot sits in a harness suspended below a fabric wing. Unlike a hang glider whose wings have frames, the form of a paraglider wing is formed by the pressure of air entering vents or cells in the front of the wing. This is known as a ram-air wing (similar to the smaller parachute design). The paraglider's light and simple design allows them to be packed and carried in large backpack, and make them one of simplest and economical modes of flight. Competition level wings can achieve glide ratios up to 1:10 and fly around speeds of . Like sailplanes and hang gliders, paragliders use rising air (thermals or ridge lift) to gain height. This process is the basis for most recreational flights and competitions, though aerobatics and 'spot landing competitions' also occur. Launching is often done by jogging down a slope, but winch launches behind a towing vehicle are also used. A Paramotor is a paraglider wing powered by a motor attached to the back of the pilot, and is also known as a powered paragliders. A variation of this is the paraplane, which has a motor mounted on a wheeled frame rather than the pilot's back. Comparison of gliders, hang gliders and paragliders There can be confusion between gliders, hang gliders, and paragliders. Paragliders and hang gliders are both foot-launched glider aircraft and in both cases the pilot is suspended (\\"hangs\\") below the lift surface. \\"Hang glider\\" is the term for those where the airframe contains rigid structures, whereas the primary structure of paragliders is supple, consisting mainly of woven material. Military gliders Waco CG-4A of the USAF Military gliders were used mainly during the Second World War for carrying troops and heavy equipment (see Glider infantry) to a combat zone. These aircraft were towed into the air and most of the way to their target by military transport planes, e.g. C-47 Dakota, or by bombers that had been relegated to secondary activities, e.g. Short Stirling. Once released from the tow near the target, they landed as close to the target as possible. Advantages over paratroopers were that heavy equipment could be landed and that the troops were quickly assembled rather than being dispersed over a drop zone. The gliders were treated as disposable leading to construction from common and inexpensive materials such as wood, though a few were retrieved and re-used. By the time of the Korean War, transport aircraft had also become larger and more efficient so that even light tanks could be dropped by parachute, causing gliders to fall out of favor. Research aircraft Horten Ho IV flying wing sailplane prone seating glider Even after the development of powered aircraft, gliders have been built for research, where the lack of powerplant reduces complexity and construction costs and speeds development, particularly where new and poorly understood aerodynamic ideas are being tested that might require significant airframe changes. Examples have included delta wings, flying wings, lifting bodies and other unconventional lifting surfaces where existing theories were not sufficiently developed to estimate full scale characteristics. Unpowered flying wings built for aerodynamic research include the Horten flying wings, the scaled glider version of the Armstrong Whitworth A.W.52 jet powered flying wing. Lifting bodies were also developed using unpowered prototypes. Although the idea can be dated to Vincent Justus Burnelli in 1921, interest was nearly non-existent until it appeared to be a solution for returning spacecraft. Traditional space capsules have little directional control while conventionally winged craft cannot handle the stresses of re-entry, whereas a lifting body combines the benefits of both. The lifting bodies use the fuselage itself to generate lift without employing the usual thin and flat wing so as to minimize the drag and structure of a wing for very high supersonic or hypersonic flight as might be experienced during the re-entry of a spacecraft. Examples of type are the Northrop HL-10 and Martin-Marietta X-24. The NASA Paresev Rogallo flexible wing glider was built to investigate alternative methods of recovering spacecraft. Although this application was abandoned, publicity inspired hobbyists to adapt the flexible wing airfoil for modern hang gliders. Rocket gliders Me 163B on display at the National Museum of the USAF Rocket-powered aircraft consume their fuel quickly and so most must land unpowered unless there is another power source. The first rocket plane was the Lippisch Ente, and later examples include the Messerschmitt Me 163 rocket-powered interceptor.The Me 163 was powered by an unstable fuel mix and landing with fuel left caused several accidents The American series of research aircraft starting with the Bell X-1 in 1946 up to the North American X-15 spent more time flying unpowered than under power. In the 1960s research was also done on unpowered lifting bodies and on the X-20 Dyna-Soar project, but although the X20 was cancelled, this research eventually led to the Space Shuttle. NASA's Space Shuttle first flew on April 12, 1981. The Shuttle re-entered at Mach 25 at the end of each spaceflight, landing entirely as a glider. The Space Shuttle and its Soviet equivalent, the Buran shuttle, were by far the fastest ever aircraft. Recent examples of rocket glider include the privately funded SpaceshipOne which is intended for sub-orbital flight and the XCOR EZ-Rocket which is being used to test engines. Rotary wing Most unpowered rotary-wing aircraft are kites rather than gliders, i.e. they are usually towed behind a car or boat rather than being capable of free flight. These are known as rotor kites. However rotary-winged gliders, 'gyrogliders', were investigated that could descend like an autogyro, using the lift from rotors to reduce the vertical speed. These were evaluated as a method of dropping people or equipment from other aircraft. Unmanned gliders Paper airplane A paper plane, paper aeroplane (UK), paper airplane (US), paper glider, paper dart or dart is a toy aircraft (usually a glider) made out of paper or paperboard; the practice of constructing paper planes is sometimes referred to as aerogami (Japanese: kamihik≈çki), after origami, the Japanese art of paper folding. Model gliders Model glider aircraft are flying or non-flying models of existing or imaginary gliders, often scaled-down versions of full size planes, using lightweight materials such as polystyrene, balsa wood, foam and fibreglass. Designs range from simple glider aircraft, to accurate scale models, some of which can be very large. Larger outdoor models are usually radio-controlled gliders that are piloted remotely from the ground with a transmitter. These can remain airborne for extended periods by using the lift produced by slopes and thermals. These can be winched into wind by a line attached to a hook under the fuselage with a ring, so that the line will drop when the model is overhead. Other methods of launching include towing aloft using a model powered aircraft, catapult- launching using an elastic bungee cord and hand-launching. When hand-launching the newer \\"discus\\" style of wing-tip hand-launching has largely supplanted the earlier \\"javelin\\" type of launch. Glide bombs A glide bomb is a bomb with aerodynamic surfaces to allow a gliding flightpath rather than a ballistic one. This allows the bomber aircraft to stand off from the target and launch the bomb from a safe distance. Most types have a remote control system which enables the aircraft to direct the bomb accurately to the target. Glide bombs were developed in Germany from as early as 1915. In World War II they were most successful as anti-shipping weapons. Some air forces today are equipped with gliding devices that can remotely attack airbases with a cluster bomb warhead.

In his introduction to Emergency Poems Peter Horn described Gottschalk's contribution as follows: \\"wit and conceit also seem to me to describe most adequately the poetic and aesthetic vehicles which Gottschalk chooses to address the political in poetry. Often, when critics address poetry like Gottschalk's they use the term satire, this most misplaced and displaced genre in English poetry. What is central to satire and to wit is not, as popular misconception may have it, its comic quality, the funniness, but the sudden flashlike insight into the incongruous, as Freud has clearly shown in his study on the Witz.Keith Gottschalk's contribution to the culture of the people: The 'wit' of popular poetry and the 'conceit' of the 'learned' poet.\\" In: \\"Emergency Poems.\\" He was praised for his poems' \\"tight control and their strategy of irony.\\" His modernisation of the traditional African praise poem \\"shows their continued existence and meaning for large portions of the population.\\"Peter Horn, \\"Travelling Theory in Trouble\\", Pretexts, 10, 1.

History World Wrestling Entertainment Ohio Valley Wrestling (2007) On the May 11, 2007 episode of SmackDown!, a vignette aired suggesting that Ray Gordy would be repackaged as \\"Jesse Dalton\\" as part of a tag team using a hillbilly gimmick, alongside fellow WWE developmental talent Drew Hankinson (formerly \\"The Imposter Kane\\") who was repackaged as \\"Festus Dalton\\". It was reported on June 2, 2007 that the \\"Dalton Boys\\" gimmick was dropped by WWE, with the kayfabe explanation given that they had \\"lost their way\\" to the arena. Gordy and Hankinson were sent back to a development territory. Gordy continued to use the Dalton name in OVW and Hankinson used the name \\"Justice Dalton\\". They also wore more traditional wrestling tights. SmackDown (2007‚Äì2009) On the June 29, 2007 episode of SmackDown!, vignettes hyping Jesse and Festus's return to the roster, sans the Dalton name (and no longer presented as brothers), began to air. Their vignettes were billed as 'Jesse and Festus on...', each week choosing a different subject but always with the same formula of Jesse, talking very excitedly about the subject, and ending each vignette by pointing to Festus and saying \\"that, that is the face of a\\" (something relating to the topic), while Festus merely stared absently into the camera. They wrestled in dark matches and at SmackDown! and ECW house shows. Their in-ring debut came on the October 5, 2007 episode of SmackDown! by defeating Mike Tolar and Chad Collyer when Festus used an over-the-shoulder gutbuster and pinned Tolar. This match introduced the gimmick of Festus' Pavlovian response to the ring bell: when the opening bell rang, Festus's persona changed into a very focused, aggressive competitor, as compared to the aloof, absent-minded character he had been portrayed as; when the closing bell rang, Festus returned to his \\"normal\\" self. Jesse (left) and Festus (right) in the ring On the October 16, 2007 episode of ECW, Jesse and Festus made their debut for the ECW brand in conjunction with a \\"Talent Exchange\\" discussed between ECW General Manager Armando Estrada and acting SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero. Jesse and Festus defeated their first notable opponents, the team of Elijah Burke and Nunzio, with an aided diving shoulder block.Jesse and Festus ECW victory On the November 9 episode of SmackDown!, Jesse and Festus suffered their first WWE loss in a 10-man tag team battle royal WWE Tag Team Championship contender's match, against Deuce 'n Domino, The Major Brothers, Shannon Moore and Jimmy Wang Yang, and Drew McIntyre and Dave Taylor. Festus, the biggest man in the ring and obviously a threat, was eliminated early due to a team effort from the other teams. Thus, Jesse was eliminated as well. Jesse and Festus suffered their second loss in the WWE when they were defeated by then- WWE Tag Team Champions The Miz and John Morrison on the November 27 episode of ECW. Jesse and Festus were defeated again by Miz and Morrison on the December 7 episode of SmackDown!. Jesse and Festus finally defeated The Miz and John Morrison in a non-title match on December 16. After a brief hiatus, more vignettes aired, this time featuring Jesse, who explained Festus's condition and spoke of a cure for it. The team returned on the February 8, 2008 episode of SmackDown, defeating Deuce 'n Domino. Festus appeared to be unchanged, aside from perhaps being more aggressive than ever. This success continued as they once again defeated The Miz and John Morrison in another non-title match on the February 29 airing of SmackDown. When they received a shot at the titles on the March 21 episode, however, they came up short, and similarly lost out months later at The Great American Bash, when the titles changed hands to Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder courtesy of a pin on Jesse. Jesse and Festus wrestling Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder On the September 12 airing of SmackDown Jesse and Festus made their way to the ring dressed in moving attire complete with a hand truck, large cardboard box and moving supplies. After an attack from Kenny Dykstra the duo proceeded to package Dykstra up and roll him away. The next week they did the same thing to Ryan Braddock and later the set of Carlito's Cabana. The gimmick highlighted SmackDown's move to MyNetworkTV, complete with overalls bearing the parodic company title of \\"MyMoving Company\\". After the show's move, however, they reverted to their previous gimmick. Split (2009‚Äì2010) The team was separated when Festus was drafted to the Raw brand in the 2009 Supplemental Draft. Jesse adopted a new in-ring persona, a white rapper called \\"Slam Master J\\". After months of inactivity, Festus returned to SmackDown as Luke Gallows, and became an enforcer for CM Punk. Punk claimed that the Festus gimmick was due to Festus being addicted to pills, but Punk had managed to cure him. J and Gallows also took part in the 26-man battle royal at WrestleMania XXVI, which was won by Yoshi Tatsu. Ray Gordy was released from his WWE contract on April 22, 2010 along with several other talents. Drew Hankinson was also released from his WWE contract six months later with several other superstars, only to eventually return in 2016 with new tag team partner Karl Anderson.

Vol. 44. No. 5. 2012. during the Late Triassic to the Early Jurassic periods. Several dinosaurs have been classified as massospondylids over the years. The largest cladistic analysis of early sauropodomorphs, which was presented by Apaldetti and colleagues in November 2011, found Adeopapposaurus, Coloradisaurus, Glacialisaurus, Massospondylus, Leyesaurus and Lufengosaurus to be massospondylids. This result supports many previous analyses that tested fewer taxa. However, this analysis found the two recently described North American massopods, Sarahsaurus and Seitaad, and the South African Ignavusaurus to nest outside Massospondylidae, as opposed to some provisional proposals. Earlier in 2011, Pradhania, a sauropodomorph from India, was tested for the first time in a large cladistic analysis and was found to be a relatively basal massospondylid. Mussaurus and Xixiposaurus may also be included within Massospondylidae. In 2019, a specimen previously assigned to Massospondylus from South Africa was re-examined and found to belong to a separate genus that was named Ngwevu. Phylogeny Massospondylidae, which was first named by Huene in 1914, is a stem-based taxon. It was defined by Sereno as all animals more closely related to Massospondylus carinatus than to Plateosaurus engelhardti and Saltasaurus loricatus. The following simplified cladogram is based on an analysis presented by Chappel and colleagues in 2019. Below is a simplified cladogram after M√ºller, 2019.

The characters are introduced through the point of view of a photographer taking their pictures in a studio, and the show looks beyond the fake poses and into the life of the person beneath. The series was filmed over late August 2007 and ran from 13 January 2008 to 25 February 2008 on BBC Three. The Song We are your friends By Justice V Simian features in the programme's opening and closing credits. Characters *Doris, an elderly woman in her eighties whose tyrannical husband Des has recently died, setting her free from a life of misery; however, Doris cannot help but compare her newly found good times to her comically shocking times with her husband, with her trademark \\"When Des were around...\\" *Paul Pearson, who claims that he has been bitten by a bat and is slowly turning into a vampire. Throughout the series, he charts his transformation \\"from human to a Dracula\\" through a series of video diaries, highlighting supposed changes in his nature. *Rufus, an upper-class man who is pursuing a hip-hop music career; however, his lyrics seem to revolve more around pudding and gypsies than anything else. *Stu, an Australian television presenter who hosts a show called 'War on Kids', which introduces parents to terrible advice on tackling problems with children, such as \\"Wet bed, teddy's dead\\". He ends each and every show by saying to his parent viewers \\"And remember, don't let your kid become a Richard.\\" *Una, who was a model and tour guide in the 1960s, before her husband lost her to a traveller from abroad. After many years, and having apparently sold most of her body parts, she has made it back to England and attempts to revive her career as a tour guide, but her tours contain little fact and she is all the while convinced that \\"they're coming for me!\\" *Pip, a very emotional American singer who talks about the many things that have made him cry (usually for the wrong reasons, such as a woman running for a train who wished she could run faster, before getting her jacket caught in the door and running very fast). Pip then plays the piano, whilst performing a song about a ridiculous topic that he feels passionate about. *Candy is an American comedian whose act doesn't appear to contain any jokes, and she simply gets through by talking about a series of subjects, whilst repeating \\"What's that all about?\\" and \\"Come on!\\" *Prudence, a proud, family-loving housewife whose husband has returned home with a Mexican immigrant called Chachi, whom he had apparently run over. It becomes quickly obvious that he is having an affair with Chachi, something that Prudence remains oblivious to, despite the many, obvious clues. *Sonny, a baby who has adult characteristics and speaks with the accent of an East-End geezer. He talks about how all adults, namely his father and his grandparents, appear stupid to him, except his mother, whom he seems to favour above anybody else. *Gary, a man who won the lottery, but refused to claim his winning, believing it to be a television prank. He remains convinced that it is all a big joke, even when the story begins to worsen, for example, his son announcing that he is in debt to drug dealers, but who, upon Gary's laughing refusal to collect the winnings, is found dead. *Noodle, a controversial artist who attempts to make bold statements through his art about things that aren't particularly important to anyone; however, he doesn't actually know what the meaning of any of his art is, and waits for the critics to tell him. *Ian Jackson is a demonic schoolkid who tells his class, and increasingly shocked teacher, of the things he got up to over the weekend (\\"My weekend, by Ian Jackson...\\"). His tales usually revolve around him causing people bad injuries or even death, as well as another teacher who repeatedly sexually harasses him, whilst he, Ian, remains completely oblivious to the horrid truth of any of it External links *Marc Wootton's official website and blog Category:BBC television comedy ","title":"Marc Wootton Exposed"},{"id":"13049100","text":"WQMF is a mainstream rock radio station in Louisville, Kentucky. The station is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to the nearby city of Jeffersonville, Indiana, and broadcasts on 95.7 FM with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 28.5 kW. The station's studios are in the Louisville enclave of Watterson Park and the transmitter site is near Elizabeth, Indiana, west of the Ohio River. The station is owned by iHeartMedia. Station history 95.7 signed on as WQHI in April 1974 as \\"HI 95\\", an automated Top 40 station utilizing TM's \\"Stereo Rock\\" format. The first song played when HI 95 signed on was \\"Oh My My\\" by Ringo Starr. In January 1981, WQHI was sold and the format was changed to Album Rock as \\"96 WQMF\\". Within a short period of time, QMF was successful in toppling WLRS as the top Album Rock station in the market under Program Director Tom Owens. Many current well-known Louisville radio personalities appeared on the station. The early years consisted of Ron Clay and Terry Meiners on \\"The Show With No Name\\". They used this morning show name after departing the morning show at WLRS where their ‚ÄúMorning Sickness‚Äù name had been trademarked by WLRS. After Meiners departed, Clay continued his morning run at QMF with Mason Dixon and later Alan Sells. Clay left WQMF in early 1986 for KZAP in Sacramento, CA. Until his return less than a year later. Clay continued his run with ‚ÄúUncle Ron's Asylum\\" until his passing in 1991. QMF then hired LRS 102's alum Rocky Knight to launch \\"The Rocky & Troy Morning Show\\". Karen Bach-Markins, Duke Meyer, and Future Bob were also on QMF as well. Their former mascot of WQMF was Wacky T.

KPRS/1590 debuted as a 500-watt daytimer with a playlist that consisted of R&B; and soul. In 1951, KPRS opened its first studio at 12th and Walnut street, Kansas City, Missouri. By 1952, Carter and Ed and Psyche Pate became business partners and purchased the station for $40,000 from the Johnson County Broadcasting Corporation. They moved KPRS to a new site at 2814 East 23rd Street in Kansas City. In 1969, the Carters had controlling interest in the station. In 1971, KPRS moved its programming to the 103.3 frequency on the FM dial and became KPRS-FM, \\"Hot 103 Jamz\\" and the 1590 frequency became KPRT, \\"Gospel 1590, The Gospel Source\\" an urban gospel-formatted station.

Life Gifford was born in Dry Drayton, near Cambridge and attended Christ's College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1570 and MA in 1573. He afterwards lived at Maldon, but was discharged from the priesthood for refusing to subscribe to Archbishop Whitgift's articles of conformity. He was later reinstated as a lecturer at Maldon, serving there as a lecturer until his death in 1600. It is possible that in 1586 he attended the deathbed of Sir Philip Sidney in the Low Countries, where Gifford was serving as chaplain to the Earl of Essex's troops. Gifford may well have penned The Manner of Sir Philip Sidney's Death. Works Gifford wrote some twenty-two published works. These include a translation of William Fulke's Praelections vpon the sacred and holy Reuelation of S. Iohn (1573; STC:11443); A briefe discourse of certaine points of the religion which is among the common sort of Christians, which may bee termed the countrie diunitie (1581; STC:11845), which was his most popular work; A dialogue betweene a Papist and a Protestant (1582; STC:11849); and two works on witchcraft, A discourse of the subtill practises of deuilles by witches and sorcerers (1587; STC:11852) and A Dialogue Concerning Witches and Witchcrafts (1593; STC:11850). It is the last work for which he is best known. Gifford was a moderate in the witchcraft debate, although he still believed in the existence of witches, and that they should be severely punished. His main concern in the Dialogue was to ensure more care was taken in witchcraft prosecutions, and to attempt to restrain the persecuting fervour with which witches were sought out and indicted.

His feats were adapted to an opera in 1967 and two comedy films, Nastradin Hodzha i Hitar Petar of 1939 and Hitar Petar of 1960. There are many prose and poetry in which Itar Pejo appears as the main hero, and it was a common theme for Macedonian humor and cartoonists. In 1977, MRT recorded a TV series, according to the script by Mile Nedelkovski. There are over thirty stories about Itar Pejo, which firstly collected the writer Stale Popov in the collection \\"Itar Pejo\\". In 1966, Slavko Janevski published the poetry collection \\"The Gospel of Itar Pejo\\", which contains the songs \\"Itar Pejo for One Another\\" and \\"Svetovrazha\\". Hitar Petar is similar to other characters of European and Oriental folklore, most notably Nasreddin of Islamic folklore, the German Till Eulenspiegel, the Flemish Thyl Ulenspiegel, the Hungarian Csal√≥ka P√©ter and the Jewish Hershele Ostropoler.

The museum has research and administrative responsibility over archaeology and biology in Central Norway. Additionally, the museum operates comprehensive community outreach programs and has exhibits in wooden buildings in Kalvskinnet. The Ringve Botantical Garden in Lade as well as Kongsvoll Alpine Garden in Dovre are also under the jurisdiction of the NTNU University Museum. The museum has its roots in the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters (, formerly \\"The Trondheim Society\\", ) since 1760. Since 1968, the museum was closely affiliated with the University in Trondheim, then with NTNU since 1996. In addition to managing archives and producing exhibits, the museum participates in larger research projects and cooperates with other university museums in digitizing collected works and building databases. Norway's Museum Union () named the NTNU University Museum \\"Norway's Museum of the Year\\" in 2010.Museumsforbundets oversikt over mottagere av prisen gjennom √•rene Reidar Andersen has been the museum director since August 1, 2013. History The museum's history can be traced to 1760, when two Norwegians, bishop Johan Ernst Gunnerus and historian and rector Gerhard Sch√∏ning, and the Danish historian Peter Frederik Suhm established Det Trondhiemske Selskab. In 1767, the society received royal confirmation of its statutes, and the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters (DKNVS) was officially formed. DKNVS then began the process of collecting archaeological and natural history materials, which eventually became the organization's main task. In 1926, the DKNVS was reorganized and split into an academy and museum, and the DKNVS Museum has since then operated independently. With the establishment of the University in Trondheim in 1968, the museum merged with the university. A new reorganization effective January 1, 1996 lead to the establishment of the Norwegian University of Sciences and Technology (NTNU). From this point, the museum was officially referred to as the NTNU University Museum. In 2005, the museum was elevated to the same title as the faculties within NTNU and became a semi-independent entity within the university, placed directly under the jurisdiction of the university leadership like any other faculty. Role in society The museum is tasked with developing and conveying knowledge about nature and culture. It is also responsible for protecting and preserving scientific collections, as well as making them available for research, development, and propagation. The Cultural Heritage Act defines the tasks and scopes of such work in paragraph 1: The museum's geographic jurisdictions is outlined in the Act's second paragraph: The museum's organization from January 1, 2017 The merger between NTNU, Gj√∏rvik University College, S√∏r- Tr√∏ndelag University College (HiST), and √Ölesund University College took effect on January 1, 2016. The activities of each faculty in NTNU continued as usually with small changes in 2016, while preparations were made in different areas in regards to study plans, professional and administrative organizing, and quality control in all areas in anticipation of January 1, 2017, the official completion of the merger. As a part of the merger between NTNU and the three colleges, the museum's own organization was changed, such that the professional divisions were clarified: * The section for natural history became the Institute of Natural History * The section for archaeology and cultural history became the Institute for Archaeology and Cultural History The other two sections are mainly service providers and were organized into the museum administration virtually unaltered: *The section for development changed its name to the Section for Public Exhibitions *The National Laboratory for Dating has not changed its name. The Institute of Natural History deals with research within biogeography, biosystems, and ecology, with an emphasis on preservation biology. Within NTNU, the institute has had the special responsibility of building and maintain scientific collections of objects and long-term data series. The institute also operates a taxidermy laboratory, two botanical gardens, and provides training and student advising within its professional scope. The Institute of Archaeology and Cultural History deals with research in pre-historic, historic, and Sami archaeology and operates the laboratory for preservation technology. The institute has had the special responsibility for implementing archaeological surveys and excavations in Tr√∏ndelag, Nordm√∏re, Romsdal, and Helgeland. The institute has a conservation laboratory, and is responsible for the cultural history collections. The institute also provides training for profession-oriented archaeology. The Section for Public Exhibitions is responsible for the museum's exhibition business. This includes the production and operations of the exhibitions, sometimes on contract from external partners, as well as activities and events, educational programs, hosting programs, and the museum gift shop. This section also cooperates with the NTNU Communications Department to coordinate the lecture series \\"NTNU Night\\". The National Laboratory for Dating uses natural scientific measuring methods to date archaeological, natural historic, and geological materials. The laboratory for carbon-14 dating is the only laboratory in Norway that performs dating measurements of archaeological and natural scientific samples of organic materials. The laboratory also dates lumber by means of rings via dendrochronology. Research The museum's main areas of research are taxonomy, biological systematics, and evolutionary history; ecological processes and species development; human-nature interactions; cultural materials and forms of culture on a long-term scale; archaeology and advanced technologies alongside dating methods and the development of chronologies. The museum is involved in a number of research projects including DNA barcoding and the Applied Underwater Robotics Laboratory (AUR Lab). DNA barcoding uses similarities in the genetic material of organisms to identify species. The AUR Lab is a part of NTNU's efforts within ocean research within the Ocean Space Science and Technology department. In December 2011, the museum took over the coordination of the Norwegian Barcode of Life (NorBOL) project, which is Norway's contribution to The International Barcode of Life project (iBOL). Laboratories thumb|The main entrance to the Science Museum Photo: Trond Sverre Kristiansen - NTNU Science Museum The museum has several laboratories in addition to the National Laboratory for Dating. The Conversation Laboratory is responsible for managing the museum's collections. This includes both biological and cultural-historical objects stored in special magazines and/or exhibitions, along with the preservation of findings that cannot be moved to other locations (like rock art). The laboratory arranges magazines for the collections, carries responsibility for the climate control of the exhibitions, and protects and conserves art. The Taxidermy Workshop prepares animals for exhibitions or research projects. The museum receives animals that have died as a result of hunting, traffic collisions, or natural causes. The workshop will accept animals from private individuals, the Norwegian Environmental Agency, through research projects, and from the environmental protection departments of the region's various county governors. The workshop is also responsible for restoring older stuffed animals, and takes samples for DNA or environmental analyses. The Molecular Laboratory extracts DNA from all types of organisms. It has equipment for duplicating DNA fragments, measuring DNA concentrations, electrophoresis studies, and the preparation of samples for DNA sequencing. This work is central for the research projects involving NorBOL, whereby a registry of species using short, standardized pieces of genetic material (DNA Barcoding) is made available. Collections The museum has scientific collections within cultural history, zoology, botany, and geology. Since it is not possible to display all of its objects within their buildings, the museum works with other Norwegian university museums to digitize collections/pictures of each item. In 2007, the museum established the University Museums' IT Organization (), which makes these digitized collections available through the university museums' collective access points. Cultural History Collections These collections date back to the 1760s, when DKVNS began collecting natural history and cultural history materials. Pre-historic archaeological collection This collection contains objects from the past 11,000 years, i.e. from roughly 8000 BCE until the present date. The types of objects vary from small fragments of flint to gold jewelry. The collection also contains everyday tools and stones and metal weapons and jewelry crafted from metal, animal horns, and wood. The prehistoric exhibition has placed some of these objects on display. Church collection This collection contains church art and equipment from the 12th century until the 19th century, particularly church equipment that was replaced in the latter half of the 19th century. Most of these objects had a liturgical function and were received by the museum as gifts or through sales. The collection is not open to the public, but is used for studies. Coin collection The museum's coin collection was established around 1840 and contains approximately 50,000 coins, medallions, bank notes, and chips. The most important part of the collection contains coins from the Viking Age and the Middle Ages, discovered at archaeological excavations, along with some incidental finds in Romsdal, Nord-M√∏re, Tr√∏ndelag, and the southern parts of Nordland. The collection also contains donations, like the Arne E. Holm's collection of Greek, Roman, and Byzantium coins and Anton R√∏stad's collection of European coins and bank notes from the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. The collection even contains German bank notes from the 1920s, including the 50 billion mark.Vitenskapsmuseets blogginnlegg om n√∏dsedlene Trondheim archaeological collection This collection contains more than 200,000 items that were found in the massive excavation in the city's center. A few of these findings date back to before the city's foundation at Nidarneset, but most of them are from the 11th century or more recent. The Middle Ages exhibition displays findings from the city archaeological collection. Zoological collection This collection contains around 906,000 objects, from insects to stuffed animals. Some of these items are over 200 years old, but the most represented are from the 20th century. A particularly well-preserved collection is the \\"Type Collection\\", which consists of specimens that were used to define and describe new species. Around 90% of the collection is registered in the museum's own database, ZOOTRON.Museets nettsted for de zoologiske samlingene Botanical collections The main part of the botanical collection contains dried plants in herbaria. The collection also contains objects, tissue samples, and DNA extracts stored in frozen states and other dry-storage object collections. Most of the herbaria materials are registered in national databases. Occurrence data can also be found in the mapping service Artskart and GBIF-Norge, the Norwegian counterpart in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). In addition to the dry samples, the museum's collections also contains living plants in the botanical gardens in Ringve and Kongsvoll. Geological collections The museum's collections of minerals, rocks, and fossils are among the earliest collected objects in Norway's museums. The collection contains around 8000 objects, where roughly 30 minerals are from the museum's first catalog in 1779. None of the items in the geological collection are placed on display today. Exhibitions The museum has both fixed, permanent exhibitions, as well as temporary exhibitions. These are partially arranged by the museum itself, while others are organized by guest exhibitions produced by other institutions or organizations, or in collaboration with the museum and other entities. The exhibitions are shown in three buildings in Kalvskinnet in Trondheim: In the building Gunnerushuset, archaeological exhibits from the Stone, Bronze, and Iron ages, along with the Viking Age in Central Norway are placed on display. The building also houses other exhibits, like the \\"1760 - Science at the Edge of the World\\" exhibition. This exhibition addresses the history of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters and a few items from the museum's very first collections. The Institute for Archaeology and Cultural History, along with the Section for Public Exhibitions have administrative offices in this building. In the building Suhmhuset, the museum runs the \\"Middle Ages in Trondheim\\" exhibition, which was nominated for the European Museum of the Year Award in 1997. This building also houses the \\"Who Owns History\\" exhibit containing southern Sami archaeological items. Sch√∏ninghuset contains the museum's administration, the offices for the Institute of Natural History, and several magazines. As of April 2017, the museum has been in the process of a reorganization due to the large exhibit, \\"BODY WORLDS Vital\\", which was displayed in Gunnerhuset between June 8 and October 8, 2017.Museets informasjon om utstillingen Several of the museum's exhibits were removed to make room for BODY WORLDS Vital. Several were replaced again, either entirely or partially after October 2017. The following exhibits remained during \\"BODY WORLDS Vital\\": ;Middle Ages in Trondheim This exhibit is permanent. It primarily focuses on recreating life in Trondheim during the Catholic Middle Ages, circa 1010‚Äì1537, through a simulated image created from objects and building ruins found underneath Trondheim streets. Norway's oldest wooden constructions were found in Trondheim, and these buildings have been reconstructed based on the results of archaeological findings. ;Who owns history? This exhibit opened on February 5, 2017 and remained on displayed throughout the year. It was produced in conjunction with Tr√•ante 2017 and in collaboration with collaboration with the Southern S√°mi museum, the museum, and the . The exhibit includes finds that show the S√°mi presence in Southern Norway far earlier than previously thought. ;1760 - Science at the Edge of the World The exhibit depicts the 18th century as a transition period between the Middle Age church-dominated worldview and the start of the modern era - the Enlightenment Era and the Scientific Revolution. It offers an image of Trondheim in the 18th centyrt, the early learning environment and the conditions for the establishment of DKNVS. The exhibition deals with astronomy and science, technological advancements, and societal upheaval, the DKNVS's operations and exhibition business. Books and publications play an important role in the exhibit, alongside the original printings and illustrations. ;Central Norway's prehistory The exhibit regarding Central Norway's prehistory covers a span of 10,000 years, from the early Stone Age until the 11th century BCE. It contains tools of flint, quartz, and slate from the Stone Age. From the Bronze Age, the exhibit contains jewelry, weapons, and tools from bronze from abroad. Findings from the early Iron Age reflect tapestry-weaving, goldsmithing, blacksmithing, and imports from the Roman Empire. The exhibition is the only preserved \\"classical\\" archaeological exhibit in Norway. Human tools, jewelry, and weapons are exhibited in the manner in which they were found, without an attempt to reconstruct living environments or objects. These exhibits were deconstructed or closed during BODY WORLDS, but were partially replaced in October 2017. ;Polar Night This exhibit covers light, plans, and animals in the Arctic Ocean. ;Deadly Business thumb|Butterflies in the Exhibition on Illegal Trade Photo: Trond Sverre Kristiansen/NTNU Vitenskapsmuseet This exhibit shows how illegal businesses threaten the existence of certain species. ;Nature/Environment This exhibition displays the typical Norwegian nature biomes from coasts to mountains, including Mixed coniferous forest and temperate broadleaf forests, swamps, lakes, rivers and streams, beaches, islets, and reefs. The lifelike constructions of these environments feature a large portion of Norway's plants and birds. This exhibit includes low-hanging plants, moss, and other vascular plant. ;Internet exhibits The museum produces both its own internet exhibitions in connection with their physical exhibits, as well as standalone exhibits. These can show parts of the collections: the museum's history, along with collections and items placed in context with each other.Museets oversikt over, og lenker, til nettutstillingene New dissemination methods The museum has been involved in projects for spreading knowledge and scientific interest in new ways and through other media. The museum has cooperated with \\"TV-Adessa\\" in a network television series entitled \\"Dead animals in the archive\\".dyr i arkivet Program fra serien p√• adressa.no Several million objects can be found in the museum's magazines and only a small portion of these are ever exhibited to the public at any given time. Through \\"Dead animals in the archive\\", viewers were able to experience some of the diverse animal species in the museum's magazines. In cooperation with students at the Institute for Information Technology at NTNU, the museum developed the \\"Science Game\\", a virtual reconstruction of Trondheim in the Middle Ages. Through animation and video game technology, they created short films that depicted how the Middle Ages in Trondheim may have looked.Et eksempel p√• en virtuell rekonstruksjon, Dag Sv√•n√•s masteroppgave, Nidaros p√• f√∏rste halvdel av 1300-tallet p√• YouTube The Science Game is an app for smart phones that is designed for use while at the museum's exhibit.

Rokne p√• prezi.com Botanical gardens thumb|upright|From the Ringve Botanical Garden Photo: √Öge Hojem/Vitenskapsmuseet Ringve Botanical Garden The botanical garden encircles the Ringve Music Museum at Lade, east of Trondheim, roughly three kilometers from the city's center. The botanical garden's most important task is to take care of and develop the plant collections that are used for research and teaching, to spread knowledge about botanical diversity, and to contribute to the conservation of endangered species. The garden comprises roughly 130 acres and is divided into several discrete areas: the Arboretum containing bushes and trees from the Northern Hemisphere; the \\"Old Garden\\" with traditional garden plants from Central Norway; the \\"Park\\", which is the old courtyard that used to serve as a farmhouse; the \\"Renaissance Garden\\", an herb garden that contains plants that were first sown in Trondheim in the 17th century; and the \\"Plant System\\", a systematic garden constructed to display the familial relationships between plants and their developmental history. Kongsvoll Mountain Garden The mountain garden covers 8 acres in an area situated 805 meters above sea level at the Kongsvoll mountain lodge in Dovre. It is a natural garden containing local flora and vegetation. The mountain garden is the only botanical mountain garden in Scandinavia. The garden contains most of the typical vascular plants that grow in the mountain regions in Southern Norway. In addition, the garden contains a few uncommon plants, emphasizing the particular characteristics of the rich flora of Dovrefjell. The mountain garden was established in 1992 by Simen Bretten, who was then the leader of the Kongsvoll biological station. The new infrastructure that was established replaced an earlier mountain garden that was established in 1924 by the botanist Thekla Resvoll, which was situated at Kongsvoll Station.

The film was Linehan's directorial debut. The film stars Martin Savage as a man, John Ward, but credited as the \\"Subject\\", who buys some new internet software for his computer, which begins to take over his life. The film was produced by The Film Council, Film4 Productions and Shine Limited. Plot The Subject (who is referred to as Mr Ward by the company and John by his wife - John Ward) one day receives an email advertising a product called \\"Praemus\\", described as \\"The cheaper, faster and better way of using the internet.\\" After the Subject buys Praemus, he advises his friends to get it also. He also notices the mysterious connection unit, which helps the user to connect to his computer by sticking to it. The Subject then sends an email complaining about Praemus. He complains that the unit claims he was online for 200 hours in a week, and other various problems with his computer, such as his monitor vibrating, blasts of static electricity and his screen shutting down, meaning he has to send his email from an internet cafe. The Subject gets an email back saying that this is the first time the Praemus system has done this, and that he should try turning the computer off and on again. However, unknown to him, there is no one working in the Praemus office. The Subject responds by saying he does not know how to turn the system off. His friend, who normally helps him with his computer, is reluctant to get involved. Later, other problems begin to develop for the Subject, as his cat goes missing. Praemus send another complicated email explaining what to do. Whilst he reads the manual and email explaining it, his daughter begins to play with matches. The Subject then responds again saying that he tried to remove the unit, but he got badly burned when he touched the glowing Praemus logo. He continues to complain that the company keeps sending him bills, despite the fact they are not helping him. The Subject then begins to have nightmares about the unit. Praemus then send an email saying that if he damages the unit, it will result in legal action. The Subject says that they were the ones who told him to interfere with the unit. He then goes on to say that there was some sort of \\"drinking sound\\" coming from the unit. Later, the unit tries to connect with his head and sell him Praemus Life Insurance. The Subject then goes on to explain that the other units are harming the friends to whom he recommended the Praemus service. Their hands also get burned and their units also start moving. However, The Subject buys the Praemus Life Insurance. His wife leaves a note on the computer monitor in an envelope with \\"John\\" written on it. The note says that he can take the unit and shove it, that she is taking their daughter, and that he is not to try to find them. As his life deteriorates, he threatens in an email that he will begin \\"legal proceedings\\". However, as he types this, the computer refuses to display the characters onscreen. In frustration, he hits the keyboard with his head, which opens a new window on his computer. The window is a dialog box displaying the setup options for Praemus. The options are not related to the computer, but to himself and aspects of his life. Options displayed include, \\"Friends\\", \\"Spouse\\", \\"Children\\", \\"Sanity\\", \\"Pets\\" and \\"Acumen\\", all marked \\"Off\\". As soon as he tries to change one of the options, the computer turns itself off, and he has a heart attack. Praemus send an email to the Subject's wife saying they were sorry at hearing the news of the heart attack. The Subject's heartbeat then appears to stop, and the light on the unit fades away, but it turns out the heart monitor is not working. A doctor simply hits the machine and it begins to work ironically implying that's all the subject needed to do. The monitor is also made by Praemus. Finally, the Subject wakes up. Production The film was based on an idea by Jonathan Bloom and Robert Popper, who also co- wrote the film with Graham Linehan. The film was produced by Linehan, Peter La Terriere and Kenton Allen. Comic actors David Walliams, Richard Ayoade, Martin Savage and Amelia Bullmore also star, with voice-overs by Peter Serafinowicz and Julia Davis. No one is shown speaking in the film. Email text is presented as voice-over by Serafinowicz (as the original advertisement), Davis (as Praemus) and Savage (as the Subject) with Walliams as the one of the subject's friends. Ayoade plays a computer consultant, presumably Maurice Moss (due to the fact the character wears the same clothing as Moss, notably the short sleeve shirt and tie and the big glasses) from Linehan's show The IT Crowd. Linehan makes a director's cameo as the doctor in the final scene although his face is not seen. Release Hello Friend was released as an extra on the first series DVD of The IT Crowd, a television sitcom also directed and written by Linehan. Hello Friend has The IT Crowd's Richard Ayoade making a cameo as the Computer Man. The short has also been shown on Channel 4 several times.

It is about a man named Skip Sands who joins the CIA in 1965, and begins working in Vietnam during the American involvement there. The time frame of the novel is from 1963 to 1970, with a coda set in 1983. One of the protagonists of Tree of Smoke is Bill Houston, who was the main character in Johnson's 1983 debut novel Angels. There are several references in the novel to the title phrase, which has Biblical origins in three cited passages: Song of Solomon 3:6; Book of Joel 2:30, 31; and Exodus 33:9, 10. Plot Johnson's novel revolves around the associations and interactions with Francis X. Sands, a retired Air Force colonel and war hero, now a CIA official in Southeast Asia. The story is told primarily from the point of view of his nephew, William \\"Skip\\" Sands; Infantry Private James Houston and his brother Bill; and Kathy Jones, a Canadian NGO worker. The plot also includes minor but important characters Major Eddie Aguinaldo, a Filipino army officer; Nguyen Hao and his nephew Minh who work for Colonel Sands; Trung Than, Nguyen Hao's Vietcong friend turned double agent; Sergeant Jimmy Storm, a henchman of the Colonel; and a German assassin named Dietrich Fest.

History 107.9 FM signed in 1980 as KWKS, an adult contemporary station licensed to and serving Winfield (as is stated in their call letters). It changed its call letters to KSOK-FM in 1995. The station was sold to Sherman Broadcasting, with hopes of bringing an urban-formatted station to Kansas and to compete against KDGS. \\"107-9 Jamz\\" The 107-9 Jamz format debuted in 2000 with the call letters KSJM and an Urban AC format. The station's first song was \\"Got To Be Real\\" by Cheryl Lynn. The station was the Wichita affiliate of the Tom Joyner Morning Show. In 2002, the station started adding Jazz into its programming after the demise of Smooth Jazz station KWSJ 98.7 (Now News Talk KNSS-FM). The station's first studios were located in the Equity Bank building at Kellogg and Rock in East Wichita. A few years later, the station relocated its studios to the Carriage Parkway shopping center near Central and Edgemoor. In 2004, KSJM added hip hop to the playlist, shifting towards an Urban Contemporary format. The station also picked up Doug Banks for morning drive. Banks' morning show was later replaced by a local morning show. In 2007, KSJM's local morning show was replaced by Steve Harvey. KSJM was co-owned through a joint partnership with Sherman Broadcasting (the original main owner) and Carter Broadcast Group (owners of Kansas City urban station KPRS and gospel KPRT). Though the station was noted for serving a niche audience to the market near Wichita, the station had moderate to low ratings due to the location of its transmitter being situated near Winfield, which is over 50 miles from Wichita. \\"US 107.9.\\" On October 10, 2007, the two companies sold the station to Larry Steckline's AG Network Group due to declining financial revenues. On January 15, 2008, AG Network announced that KSJM would flip from Urban to Country as KWLS \\"US-107.9.\\" . The station switched formats on January 19, 2008. KWLS got its call letters from an AM station in Pratt, Kansas (Super Hits 1290) that was formerly owned by Steckline in the 1980s & 1990's. Currently, no AM station has the KWLS call; hence the 107.9 FM does not have to use the -FM suffix. In 2020, an attempted sale of the station faltered. March 2, 2020, in Sedgwick County District Court, Larry Steckline, via his LS Media, sued Mike and Tina Andra, owners of \\"Wichita Union Stockyards,\\" for an alleged failure to make agreed installment payments to buy the station.

This structure has nine stereoisomers (eight diastereomers, one of which has two enantiomers), which differ by the stereochemistry of the individual chlorine substituents on the cyclohexane. It is sometimes erroneously called \\"benzene hexachloride\\" (BHC). They have been used as models for analyzing the effects of different geometric positions of the large atoms with dipolar bonds on the stability of the cyclohexane conformation. The isomers are poisonous, pesticidal, and persistent organic pollutants, to varying degrees. Hexachlorocyclohexane was dimerized to produce mirex, a banned pesticide.

It is the third installment in the Men in Black film series which in turn is loosely based on the comic book series The Men in Black by Lowell Cunningham. It was released fifteen years after the original Men in Black (1997) and ten years after the first sequel, Men in Black II (2002). Sonnenfeld and Steven Spielberg returned as director and executive producer, respectively. In the film, Boris the Animal, an old enemy of Agent K, escapes from prison and travels back in time to kill the younger K in order to allow his species, a ruthless alien race known as Boglodites, to attack Earth. This forces Agent J to go back in time and team up with K's younger self to save his partner and the world. With a budget of over US $215 million, it is not only one of the most expensive films made but also the most expensive comedy film made as of 2020. Men in Black 3 was released on May 25, 2012 by Columbia Pictures and grossed over $624 million worldwide, making it the 10th highest-grossing film of 2012. Unadjusted for inflation, it is the highest-grossing film in the series. The film also received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised it as an improvement over its predecessor. A spin-off film in the series, Men in Black: International, was released on June 14, 2019. Plot In 2012, an alien criminal named Boris the Animal, a Boglodite, escapes from a maximum- security prison on the Moon to take revenge on Agent K, who shot off his left arm and captured him in 1969. He confronts K and his partner Agent J, and tells him he is \\"already dead\\". Back at MiB Headquarters, J peruses MiB's files and discovers K was responsible not only for capturing Boris, but for deploying the \\"ArcNet\\", a shield that prevented the Boglodites from conquering Earth, causing their extinction. Using an illegal time-jump device, Boris travels back in time to July 16, 1969, to kill the young Agent K. With history altered so that K is now long-dead, only J's own memory is somehow completely unaffected, and no one else from the Agency understands his obsession with K until Agent O, the new Chief of MIB following Zed's death, deduces there has been a fracture in the space-time continuum. With K gone, the ArcNet was never deployed, and present-day Earth is defenseless from a subsequent Boglodite invasion. Knowing from the Agency's records Boris will commit a murder there in 1969, J uses the same device to travel back in time to July 15, 1969, and goes to Coney Island to kill Boris and save K and the world. However, he ends up arrested by young K, who takes him to MiB Headquarters and prepares to neuralyze him, but decides at the last minute to investigate J's claims that he traveled from the future to protect him. K and J follow clues, leading them to a bowling alley, then The Factory, where they run into Andy Warhol, who turns out to be MiB Agent W in disguise. They then encounter Griffin, an alien who is in possession of the ArcNet. Griffin, who can see all possible future timelines and outcomes, senses Boris is coming and flees, but tells J and K where to meet him so he can give them the ArcNet. They meet Griffin at Shea Stadium, where he is then captured by Boris. J and K pursue and rescue Griffin, acquiring the ArcNet. Young Boris escapes and Old Boris arrives on the early morning of July 16 and they team up. Upon learning that they must go to Cape Canaveral so they can attach the ArcNet to the Apollo 11 rocket to deploy it in space, J reveals that Boris will kill K, who initially takes the news badly. J, K, and Griffin fly there using jetpacks, but they are stopped and arrested by the military. After J and K fail to convince a colonel, Griffin shows him the future, revealing to him the importance of their mission, and he assists them in getting to the launch site. As the agents climb up the rocket's launch tower, they are attacked by both young and old Boris. Unable to stop old Boris, J uses his time-travel device to evade his attacks so he can knock him off of one of the launch tower bridges. K shoots off young Boris's left arm, knocking him off of the tower while also restoring the timeline. K attaches the ArcNet to the rocket and it is deployed successfully when the rocket launches, with old Boris incinerated by the rocket exhaust. Young Boris attacks K on a beach, but the colonel saves K by sacrificing himself. Boris, knowing he is going to be arrested from his older self, goads K to do just so, but this provokes K into killing him, thus preventing the cycle from repeating. The colonel's young son James arrives and when he inquires about his father, K neuralyzes him and tells him only that his father is a hero. Observing from afar, J realizes that the young boy is himself, the colonel was his father, K has been watching over him his whole life and that he was there when the timeline changed, thus explaining why he was the only one who remembered K in the alternate 2012. With his mission complete, J returns to 2012, where he reconciles with K, who tells him the Boglodites have been extinct for forty years while J implies his new knowledge of the secret K has been hiding to protect him. Griffin observes this, and says it is his new favorite moment in human history.

Production The film's premise was first proposed to director Barry Sonnenfeld by Will Smith during the filming of Men in Black II in 2002, with Smith suggesting that his character, Agent J, travel back in time to save his partner, Agent K, while at the same time exploring Agent K's backstory. Sonnenfeld said the idea \\"turned out to be a very long process of development, mainly because of the knotting issues of time travel.\\" It was reported that Smith and executives were leery about bringing back Sonnenfeld because of conflicts on the set of Men in Black II. In a lawsuit filed against his former agents over commissions, Sonnenfeld alleged that Sony considered other directors for Men in Black 3. Sonnenfeld ultimately convinced all involved that he had a strong vision for the film. The film was first announced on April 1, 2009, by Sony Pictures Entertainment president Rory Bruer during a Sony ShoWest presentation. By October 2009, Etan Cohen had been hired to write the screenplay. Sonnenfeld read the script and started working on it in January 2010. As of March 2010, Will Smith remained undecided whether to join the film or another, The City That Sailed. Sonnenfeld in May 2010 confirmed the return of Tommy Lee Jones and Smith. Both had expressed interest in 2008 in reprising their roles. The filmmakers also included Walter F. Parkes and Laurie MacDonald as producers, with Steven Spielberg as executive producer; all were producers of the two previous films. In June 2010, writer David Koepp was hired to rewrite the Cohen script. A third writer, Jeff Nathanson, was hired in November 2010 to rewrite the segment of the script that takes place in 1969. Nathanson and Koepp, along with producer Spielberg, had previously worked together on the 2008 film Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which Spielberg directed. Special effects artist Rick Baker created the practical aliens and prosthetic makeup for the film, reprising his role from the previous two Men in Black films. In designing the look for the alien creatures, Baker used the time travel plot device as a reason to design \\"retro\\" looking aliens reminiscent of science fiction B movies of the era, saying, \\"In 2012 the aliens should look like Men in Black aliens and in 1969 they should be retro aliens. Fishbowl space helmets, guys with space suits with ribbed things on it, exposed brains, [and] bug eyes.\\" Principal photography began on November 16, 2010, even though, \\"We knew starting the movie that we didn't have a finished second or third act,\\" director Sonnenfeld said in 2012. \\"Was it responsible? The answer is, if this movie does as well as I think it will, it was genius. If it's a total failure, then it was a really stupid idea.\\" Filming was originally slated to commence on October 18, 2010, and continue until May 2011, in New York City, with shooting starting in 2010 partly in order to take advantage of a New York tax break in which the state rebates 30 percent of production costs incurred there. Filming was ultimately split into two parts, the first taking place from November until about Christmas 2010; the filmmakers announced shooting would begin again in mid-February, but it was delayed until April. Sonnenfeld initially stated he would be shooting in 3D, but later decided to film in 2D and convert to 3D during post-production. Set photos for the film appeared online on November 17, 2010, showing Smith, Jones, Emma Thompson, and Nicole Scherzinger. Filming was done in April 2011 in the Morris Park section of The Bronx. Parts of Coney Island, in Brooklyn, had parking and filming permits posted for April 24 and May 2‚Äì4, 2011, production dates for what the permits titled MIB3. Shooting also took place in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood, and was scheduled to wrap in June. For the film, the Ford Taurus SHO was selected as the MIB's official car, replacing the Ford LTD Crown Victoria and Mercedes-Benz E-Class from the first two films. For the 1969 scenes, a 1964 Ford Galaxie was used as the MIB's official car. This is the first time Frank the Pug was absent in a Men in Black movie, as well as Chief Zed, Jack Jeebs, and actor David Cross. Instead Zed is written in the story as having died and been immortalized at MIB Headquarters, and a portrait of Frank can be seen in J's apartment. An advertisement for 'The Incredible Speaking Pug' can be seen as Agent J enters Coney Island during his time in 1969. Release Activision released MIB: Alien Crisis on May 22, 2012, for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Nintendo Wii, featuring a never-before-seen MIB agent rather than Agent J or Agent K. Gameloft also developed a mobile phone video game based on the film, released on May 17, 2012, for iOS and Android. Under distribution by Sony's Columbia Pictures division, the film was theatrically released on May 25, 2012. The film was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and Blu-ray 3D on November 30, 2012, and additionally as part of a Men in Black trilogy box set on Blu- ray.http://filmonic.com/men-in-black-3-dvd-release-datehttp://www.blu- ray.com/movies/Men-in-Black-Trilogy-Limited-Edition-Giftset-with-Worm- Figurine-Blu-ray/55970/ The trilogy was released on 4K UHD Blu-Ray on December 5, 2017. Music The soundtrack for the film was composed by Danny Elfman and was released on May 29, 2012, four days after the film. The song \\"Back in Time\\" by rapper Pitbull, which was not included on the film's soundtrack album but accompanies the end credits of the film, was released as a single on March 26, 2012. It is the first lead single released to accompany a Men in Black film not to be performed by Will Smith. There were also many songs from the 1960s that feature, including; \\"2000 Light Years From Home\\" by The Rolling Stones; \\"I'm Waiting For The Man\\" by The Velvet Underground; \\"Strange Brew\\" by Cream; and \\"Pictures of Matchstick Men\\" by Status Quo.

Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 68% based on 246 reviews, with an average rating of 6.06/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"It isn't exactly a persuasive argument for the continuation of the franchisebut Men in Black III is better than its predecessor and manages to exceed expectations.\\"\\"Men in Black III\\" Rotten Tomatoes On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale, the same score earned by the first two films. Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, in particular praising Brolin's role as the young Agent K, which he cited as an excellent example of good casting. Ebert also praised the \\"ingenious plot, bizarre monsters, audacious cliff-hanging\\" and the \\"virtuoso final sequence.\\" Richard Roeper gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars while saying, \\"It's that rare threequel that doesn't suck. Great special effects, surprising amount of heart.\\" A. O. Scott of The New York Times also gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars and commented, \\"Men in Black 3 arrives in the multiplexes of the world with no particular agenda. Which may be part of the reason that it turns out to be so much fun.\\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly noted, \\"Sonnenfeld and Cohen move their baby along with an integrity and gait that ought to serve as a blueprint for other filmmakers faced with the particular challenges of reviving big-ticket and time-dated hunks of pop culture.\\" Rafer Guzman of Newsday wrote, \\"the franchise is no longer the zenith of blockbusterism, and the gooey effects from Hollywood veteran Rick Baker look overly familiar, but Men in Black 3 remains an amiable comedy with some fondly familiar faces.\\" Director Paul Thomas Anderson praised the film, saying, \\"It was [expletive] great. ... The time-travel stuff [made me] cry my eyes out. I'm a sucker for that stuff.\\" Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald gave the film 1 out of 4 stars and stated, \\"Men in Black 3 is so dull and empty, it's the first movie that has ever made me think 'Thank God this is in 3D.'\\" Cancelled sequel and spin-off Before its production with different leads, both Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones said that they would \\"consider\\" appearing in a fourth film. Jones said it would be \\"easy to pick up where we left off. We know what we are doing, we know how to do it. It's just a hell of a lot of fun.\\" In July 2012, Columbia chief executive Doug Belgrad said: In early 2013, Oren Uziel was writing a Men in Black 4 screenplay for Sony Pictures. In September 2015, series producers Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald stated the series would be rebooted as a trilogy, most likely without the involvement of Will Smith. In December 2014, it was revealed that Sony was planning a crossover between Men in Black and Jump Street. The news was leaked after Sony's system was hacked and then confirmed by the directors of the Jump Street films, Chris Miller and Phil Lord, during an interview. James Bobin was announced as director in 2016.That 21 Jump Street-Men In Black Crossover Is Actually Happening On April 13, 2016, the movie was officially announced and revealed to be titled MIB 23. In 2016 Hill expressed doubts and said the project was unlikely to happen, and that it was too complicated to make it work. A spin-off titled Men in Black: International was released in June 2019, starring Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson, with Emma Thompson reprising her role.

Originally published in January 1980, and widely known as the \\"indie chart\\", the relevance of the chart dwindled in the 1990s as major-label ownership blurred the boundary between independent and major labels. Separate independent charts are currently published weekly by the Official Charts Company.  History  In the wake of punk, small record labels began to spring up, as an outlet for artists that were unwilling to sign contracts with major record companies, or were not considered commercially attractive to those companies. By 1978, labels like Cherry Red, Rough Trade, and Mute had started up, and a support structure soon followed, including independent pressing, distribution and promotion. These labels got bigger and bigger, and by 1980 were having top 10 hits in the UK Singles Chart. Chart success was limited, however, since the official top 40 was based on sales at large chains and ignored significant sales at the scores of independent record shops that existed. Iain McNay of Cherry Red suggested to the weekly trade paper Record Business the idea of an independent record chart to address the problem, and the first independent chart appeared in 1980, published in Record Week, and later licensed to Sounds. The definition of whether or not a single was \\"indie\\" had depended on the distribution channel by which it was shipped‚Äîthe record needed to be delivered by a distribution service that was independent of the four major record companies: EMI, Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group and Universal Music Group. In 1981, compilation of the chart switched to research company MRIB. The chart served to give exposure to the independent labels and the artists on those labels. In 1985, Music Week started compiling its own indie chart, but it failed to meet the authority of the original MRIB chart, although both Sounds and Melody Maker later switched from the MRIB chart and adopted the Music Week chart instead. Other weekly music papers also published their own charts, often compiled from single record shops.Stanley, Bob (2009) \\"Will the indie chart rise again?\\", The Guardian, 31 July 2009, retrieved 2012-01-12 By 1990, the significance of the chart had been diluted by major record companies forming their own 'indie' labels, with independent distribution, in order to break new acts via exposure from the indie chart. To be included in the indie chart, a record had to be distributed independently of the corporate framework of the major record companies; the genre of music was irrelevant. Large independent distributors emerged such as Pinnacle and Spartan, and there later emerged The Cartel, an association of regional distributors including Rough Trade, Backs, and Red Rhino. The first weekly independent chart was published on 19 January 1980, with Spizzenergi's \\"Where's Captain Kirk\\" topping the singles chart, and Adam and the Ants' Dirk Wears White Sox topping the album chart. Official Charts Company Although the independent chart has less relevance today, The Official UK Charts Company still compiles a chart, consisting of those singles from the main chart on independent labels. The OCC's Independent Chart was significantly altered in June 2009. Its new system altered the qualification criteria to include only singles from labels that were at least fifty per cent owned by a record company that was not one of the main four record companies. This prevented major record companies from qualifying for the chart by outsourcing the shipping of their singles to smaller distribution services. These new changes were first unveiled at the 2008 annual general meeting of the British Phonographic Industry on 9 July, and the new chart went live on 29 June 2009. The first song to top the chart under the new system was \\"Bonkers\\" by Dizzee Rascal, which also made it to No. 1 in the main UK Singles Chart. Also during the 2000s and 2010s, many indie rock/post-punk revival bands like the Kaiser Chiefs and Arctic Monkeys topped the OCC's chart; Arctic Monkeys' single \\"Do I Wanna Know?\\" reached No. 2 in the chart in June 2013 while making it to No. 11 in the main chart.

Hydroxylamine is a biological intermediate in the nitrification (biological oxidation of ammonia with oxygen into nitrite) and in the anammox (biological oxidation of nitrite and ammonium into dinitrogen gas) which are important in the nitrogen cycle in soil and in wastewater treatment plants. Applications Hydroxylammonium chloride is used in organic synthesis for preparation of oximes and hydroxamic acids from carboxylic acids, N- and O- substituted hydroxyamines, and addition reactions of carbon-carbon double bond. During the acetyl bromide method of extracting lignin from lignocellulosic biomass, hydroxylammonium chloride can be used to remove bromine and polybromide from the solution. In surface treatments, it is used in the preparation of anti-skinning agents, corrosion inhibitors, and cleaner additives. It is also a starting material for pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals manufacturing. In the rubber and plastics industries, it is an antioxidant, vulcanization accelerator, and radical scavenger. It is also used as a fixative for textile dyes, auxiliary in some dyeing processes, as a metal extraction and flotation aid, as an antioxidant in fatty acids and soaps, and as a color stabilizer and emulsion additive in color films. It is also used in analytic chemistry in the analysis of iron in the water combined with Œ±,Œ±-dipyridyl. The hydroxylammonium chloride transforms all the iron in Fe2+, that then forms a coordination complex with the dipyridyl.

Admissions The school is primarily a single-sex establishment until the Sixth Form, where boys are admitted. The total number of students in 2006 was 1440, with 366 in the Sixth Form - of which 43 were boys. The school's motto is Quod Potes Tenta, which is translated into Strive To Your Utmost. It is situated just north of Chislehurst Road (B264), halfway (east-west) between Bromley and Chislehurst. History Bullers Wood now is a combination of several refurbished historical houses and modern additions. Named after an ancient forest, the original Bullers Wood house was built in the 1860s, and was owned by the Sanderson family from the 1870s. Scotsman John Sanderson, who had made his money sheep farming in Australia, employed local architect Ernest Newton (1856‚Äì1922) to extend the house in 1889. County council control In the 1930s, the site was bought by Sir Sydney Nicholson when he was forming the Royal School of Church Music, with the school's chapel being the present library. In 1939, the site was bought by Kent County Council. Technical and grammar school During the Second World War it was transformed into a secondary school. A V-1 flying bomb hit the Bromley Day Commercial School for Girls base on Wharton Street in Bromley, so it moved to the Bullers Wood site. It became Bromley Girls' Technical High School for ages 14‚Äì17, and after buildings were added, it became Bromley Technical High School for Girls for ages 11‚Äì18. In 1968, it became a grammar school with its present name when under Kent Education Committee. It was known as Bromley Technical School for Girls (1958 definitely) before becoming Bromley Technical High School for Girls Comprehensive In April 1974 it was now under Bromley borough control. It became a grant-maintained school in 1991, as did half of Bromley's secondary schools. In 1990 it had around 1000 girls. In 1991, after raising money from parents, it bought the ¬£65,000 La Ferronnerie study centre in deepest Normandy, which was used for week-long visits via Dieppe. The head teacher at the time was Barbara Vanderstock. The house had room for 14 girls at a time. Academy On 1 May 2011, Bullers Wood School gained academy status, marking the end of its control by Bromley borough. Achievements The school, in addition to specialising in languages, was made a Beacon School in 2000, and was awarded an Investor In People status. It also boasts Sports and Arts marks. In 2006 Ofsted described the school as \\"very good with some outstanding aspects\\". The students achieve high results year after year. It gets good GCSE results and above average A level results, which is normal for girls' comprehensive schools. Facilities and involvement in the community Bullers, as it is affectionately known, can also lay claim to providing a wide variety of facilities for its pupils. A sports field with a pavilion is located approximately 1/4 mile from the school grounds whereas a netball court lies closer to home next to the school pond. A gym, a sports hall, an assembly hall. Also available to students is the large canteen, the beautiful and well- stocked library, numerous computer rooms with flat screen monitors and a newly revealed state of the art drama studio. In addition the art-block, the school has recently built a modern computer suite for the use of art and photography students to help them progress with an increasingly digitally based curriculum. Language classes The school strives to maintain contacts with the local community. Language classes for adults are often run in the Euro-centre after school hours and fund raising activities involving local charities are a regular occurrence. Sixth form The school has a mixed sixth form open to both Bullers' girls and external students. The sixth-form centre is based in Inglewood, another former house that was previously owned by a well-to-do family. Here students have access to a kitchen with cooking appliances and computer rooms. common rooms are available for both Year 12 and 13 students and a media suite can be found in the attic. Extra-curricular activities running in the sixth form include People and Planet group who run the popular Fair Trade Friday in the foyer and social events management.

It follows one of Tian's favorite topics, Chinese minorities, a topic he touched upon in 1984's On the Hunting Ground and would return to in 2004's documentary, Delamu. Like these other films, The Horse Thief shows Tian's fascination with China's ethnic minorities, and in particular the Buddhist ceremonies that these peoples practice. The Horse Thief was produced by the Xi'an Film Studio.  Plot  The film follows the titular horse thief, Norbu as he struggles to support his family in Tibet. After his son dies, however, Norbu strives to change his ways. At the end of the film, he decides to resort to stealing horses again to support his family. He is caught and tells his family to escape back to the village where they will be welcomed while he fends off the owner. He is eventually killed at the end of the movie, though the scene is not made visible. Mirroring the starkness of the landscape, the film is nearly free of dialogue, with only the occasional terse exchange between characters.  Cast  * Daiba as Granny * Jiji Dan as Dolma, wife * Drashi as Grandfather * Gaoba as Nowre * Jamco Jayang as Tashi, son * Rigzin Tseshang as Norbu  Reception  On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, The Horse Thief has an approval rating of 100% based on 9 reviews. Derek Adams from the magazine Time Out gave the film a good review, stating: \\"It offers the most awesomely plausible account of Tibetan life and culture ever seen in the west. It's one of the few films whose images show you things you've never seen before.\\" Janet Maslin from The New York Times gave it three out of five stars, concluding: \\"The Chinese film The Horse Thief is best watched as pure spectacle, since it unfolds almost entirely without benefit of dialogue. What little talk there is tends to be plain and to the point (If only we had stew). However, from the scenic and ethnographic standpoints the film is often quite arresting.\\" Jonathan Rosenbaum writing for the Chicago Reader praising the film, saying: \\"Tian's originality and mastery of sound and image communicate directly, beyond the immediate trappings of the film's slender plot (a horse thief expelled from his clan) and regional culture (Buddhist death rituals), expressing an environmental and ecological mysticism that suggests a new relationship between man and nature. Tian had said that he made this for the 21st century, yet even today it's a film of the future.\\" In 1988, The Horse Thief won the \\"Distribution Help Award\\" (tied with Yeelen) at the Fribourg International Film Festival. In April 2019, a restored version of the film was selected to be shown in the Cannes Classics section at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. Film director Martin Scorsese listed the film (which was not widely released in foreign countries until the early 1990s) as the number one film of the decade on the television show Roger Ebert & the Movies. Since Ebert's partner Gene Siskel was being honored that year in 1999, Ebert decidedly invited Scorsese as a special guest to share his top ten list. Scorsese commented that adding the film was slightly cheating as he wanted to pick a film from the 1980s to be his number one film for the 90s decade.

Klancke, M.D. & Marsha L. Klancke Environmental Education Complex in Tuscawilla Preserve, a nature preserve in the middle of Daytona Beach that includes over 1/2 mile of boardwalks and nature trails. The preserve protects virgin Florida coastal hydric hammock, and is a habitat for endangered species of flora and fauna. Currently the Tuscawilla Preserve is closed due to damages sustained from Hurrican Irma in September 2017. Lohman Planetarium In 2014 the Museum opened a new state-of-the-art planetarium. Complete with 94 reclining seats, an immersive environment is generated 360 degrees around you from an OmniStar‚Ñ¢ projector fitted with a fish-eye lens, capable of displaying vibrant and colorful HD content across an expansive 40-foot hemispherical dome. Coupled with a powerful audio system that truly surrounds the audience, the planetarium helps visitors feel like they are really traveling through space or visiting the terrain of an exotic far-off world. The powerhouse of the planetarium comes from its software, Uniview‚Ñ¢, that provides a three- dimensional perspective of the observable universe - allowing the Museum to navigage the star field from any spot on Earth, fly to the International Space Station in low-Earth orbit, skim through the rings of Saturn, and cruise around galaxies billions of light years away. Cici and Hyatt Brown Museum of Art In 2015, the Museum opened the innovative Cici and Hyatt Brown Museum of Art, home to the largest collection of Florida art in the world. The collection of around 2,600 Florida themed oil and watercolor paintings will be on display throughout rotating exhibits. The Museum's grand central gallery and mezzanine showcase the collection's signature pieces, while six smaller galleries feature beautiful changing exhibitions with Florida themes. A gift shop and cafe add to the Brown Museum experience and make for the perfect day- long visit to the MOAS campus. Conference rooms with full meeting and presentation capabilities are available to the public on a rental basis. West Wing In fall of 2015 the Museum opened its new West Wing. The opening of the West Wing marked the completion of the last phase in a multi-phase construction projection. The new planetarium, which opened in August 2014, was also part of the West Wing project. The West Wing was originally built in a dip on the MOAS property causing it to be lower than other additions added on in the years that followed. On May 19, 2009, heavy rains resulted in four to six inches of water flooding the Museum's 20,000 sq. ft. West Wing. Museum staff began the successful removal of art and artifacts at the first signs of water intrusion. The space was rendered unusable due to the damage caused by days of continuous precipitation. Some galleries including the old Planetarium were able to be refurbished to allow them to be reopened to visitors. However, the previous home of the Giant Ground Sloth skeleton has to remain closed. On August 27, 2009, the State of Florida Division of Emergency Management issued a White Paper with a primary recommendation of demolition with reconstruction at an elevation above the building's current level to prevent future flooding issues. With help from Congressman John Mica, the Museum was able to obtain FEMA funding to make reconstruction possible. The West Wing has been completely reimagined with a distinctly contemporary feel. The old West Wing was made up of hexagon shaped pods. The new design is very straightforward and provides the visitor with clarity and awareness of their surroundings. The wing is home to six unique galleries, including the main hall; the Karshan Center of Graphic Art; the Cuban Museum, showcasing the most significant collection of Cuban paintings in the United States; the Elaine and Thurman Gillespy Jr. Gallery, featuring a large collection of Sub-Saharan African artifacts; the Mary Louise Marzullo Gallery, displaying a large collection of weaponry from all around the world; and the Prehistory of Florida Gallery, featuring Florida's Giant Ground Sloth skeleton and other natural history specimen.

White (1827-1915). The books follow the Biblical history of the world, with special focus on the conflict between Christ and Satan. The series starts with the pre-creation rebellion of Satan in Heaven, then moves on to the creation of the earth, the fall of Adam and Eve into sin, the Old Testament, the birth and ministry of Jesus until His ascension, then the early Christian church, the Dark Ages, the Protestant reformation, the last days of earth's history, the second coming of Christ, the millennium, and the destruction of sin and finally the recreation of earth and God's kingdom with man for eternity. This progression explains in detail the Seventh-day Adventist (SDA) understanding of the conflict between Christ and Satan and their understanding of the Bible and much of world history. Mrs. White wrote the books based on her research of other authors and special information which she claimed to receive through visions from God. The books thus include unique insights and concepts not found in other works of the time. Books  Patriarchs and Prophets (1890) Volume 1 covers from the rebellion of Satan in heaven to King David.

Bao'en Temple (also known as Bao'en Monastery) is a well-preserved fifteenth-century Buddhist monastery complex located in northwestern Sichuan Province, China. It was built by Wang Xi, a local chieftain, between 1440 and 1446 during Emperor Yingzong's reign (1427‚Äì64) in the Ming Dynasty (1368‚Äì1644). History The monastery complex, which includes a main hall, pavilions, Dabei Hall (enshrining a thousand-armed image of Avalokitesvara) and Huayan Hall (containing a precious revolving sutra cabinet, zhuanlun cang) was completed by 1443. The wall paintings, sculptures and other ornamental details were finished by 1460. These ornamental additions, such as the Ming period sculpture, painting and murals, the wooden Avalokitesvara and the sutra repository are masterpieces of the period. The complex is very well preserved and a major achievement in Ming religious architecture. Description As is typical in Chinese Buddhist temples, the major halls were constructed along a central axis while the minor halls and other structures were built along transverse axes. The many galleries connecting the halls form rectangular courtyards. Numerous other buildings are part of the complex including a meditation hall, a fasting hall, and storage halls. Stele pavilions stand on the east and west sides. As is characteristic of the Ming style, in every hall part of the ceiling is exposed. Dabei hall has double eaves. Under the eaves have been placed dougong, an assemblage of a number of blocks and arms (sets of brackets) that support the hall's roof. Forty-eight different types and 2,200 sets of dougong support and ornament the structures within the Bao'en Temple complex. The main hall is the most important building; its roof is covered with black and green glazed tiles. At the centre of Dabei Hall is a golden statue of Guanyin, the goddess of mercy, carved out of a nanmu tree. The figure is nine metres tall and has 1,004 clusters of hands and eyes. At the centre of Huayan Hall is the revolving sutra cabinet, a huge octagonal wooden structure that turns like a lever and even today can still turn smoothly.

He is currently retired and resides in Zurich, Switzerland, where he is engaged in painting and creative writing. At retirement he was honored with the title of Professor Emeritus at Tulane (1967‚Äì1997). Prior to Tulane, he served on the faculty of St. Louis University (school of medicine); was a lecturer at Washington University (school of dentistry) and director of clinical microbiology in St. Louis City Hospital (Snodgrass Laboratory of Pathology and Bacteriology), St. Louis, Missouri. Over the course of his thirty-nine-year career, Domingue received funding from the National Institutes of Health, Veterans Administration, and a variety of national and international research foundations; served on grant review committees of these agencies as well as consultant to various journal review boards. He also served as clinical microbiology and research consultant to hospital clinical laboratories and to industry. He enjoys international recognition as an authority on the basic biology and medical significance of atypical bacterial organisms and is considered a pioneer and an expert on the role of these unusual bacteria in the persistence and expression of kidney and urological infectious diseases. Domingue was named a Fellow of the American Academy for Microbiology (1973) and a Fellow of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (1975).Marquis Who's Who, Inc. (2000). Who's who in medicine and healthcare. New Providence NJ: Marquis Who's WhoMarquis Who's Who, Inc. (1993). Who's who in science and engineering. Wilmette, Ill: Marquis Who's Who. In 1995, he received the prestigious Palmes Academiques Medal (Chevalier) from the country of France. Education and early work Domingue was born in 1937 in Lafayette, Louisiana. He was educated at Southwestern Louisiana Institute (presently University of Louisiana at Lafayette, LA), receiving the Bachelor of Science degree in three years (bacteriology with minors in chemistry and French); matriculating to graduate school at the University of Southwestern Louisiana (presently University of Louisiana at Lafayette)(graduate courses in bacteriology, atomic physics and advanced qualitative organic chemistry; served as instructor of laboratory courses in bacteriology and immunology in university); Louisiana State University(basic medical sciences) and Tulane University where he earned the doctorate (1964); holds the Ph.D. degree in medical microbiology and immunology; followed by a postdoctoral research fellowship in microbiology/infectious diseases and a residency in clinical microbiology under the mentorship of the late distinguished bacteriologist/immunologist, Erwin Neter at The Children's Hospital of the State University of New York, Buffalo, New York. He first became interested in the role of atypical bacterial forms after noting that a large number of patients with urinary tract infections suffer from continual relapsing illness. Using a direct phase microscope, he examined the urine specimens of several patients with urinary tract infections and found atypical bacteria in his samples. He began to investigate atypical bacteria (cell wall- defective, L-forms and difficult-to-culture bacteria) striving to better understand their biology and the role they play in causing disease. Over the course of the next 30 years, he was able to explain much of the mystery behind how the bacteria are able to persist in the body, and published a wide array of clinical and experimental studies on the subject. L-form bacteria ‚Äì electron dense bodies Domingue worked with a team that included pre and post-doctoral students and fellows along with faculty colleagues and laboratory assistants. Together they discovered that L-form bacteria are able to form tiny dense bodies within parent cells that already lack cell walls. They noted that the forms, which they called electron dense bodies were so small that they could pass through bacterial filters that normally withheld ordinary bacteria with cell walls. The electron dense bodies could persist inside tissue culture cells in the laboratory. After applying these data to the human condition, Domingue reasoned that in some patients who suffer from chronic bacterial infections, the disease process could be related to the fact that bacteria are able to differentiate into the resistant electron dense bodies that he observed in tissue cultures. Significant papers In 1974, he and his graduate student, Mary Green, along with Paul Heidger, a faculty collaborator, published two landmark companion papers in the journal Infection and Immunity. The papers detail how L-form bacteria inside an experimental human embryonic kidney tissue culture system are able to persist in cells and explains how they are able to revert into the cell wall-containing parent bacterial form. They also proposed a detailed reproductive cycle for L-form bacteria, followed by electron microscopy of the microorganisms. These papers set the stage for Domingue and his team to delve even further into the role that cryptic atypical bacteria play in causing persistent and recurrent infections. In 1997, he and a colleague, the late Hannah Woody published an invited extensive review article on chronic bacterial infection in Clinical Microbiological Reviews. Among their conclusions was the claim that \\"difficult to culture and dormant bacteria are involved in the latency of infection and that these persistent bacteria may be pathogenic.\\" He implicated atypical bacteria in several kidney-related diseases including pyelonephritis, glomerulonephritis, idiopathic hematuria, and interstitial cystitis. He also speculated about their role in other diseases such as rheumatic fever, tuberculosis, syphilis, and rheumatoid arthritis. In the review Domingue stated, \\"Clearly, any patient with a history of recurrent infection and persistent disability is sending the signal that the phenomenon (infection with atypical bacteria) could be occurring. The so-called autoimmune diseases in which no organism can be identified by routine testing techniques are particularly suspect.\\" He went on to conclude, \\"Bacteriologic advances, which include special culture media and stains, electron microscopy and molecular techniques such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction), have revealed an increasing number of previously unidentifiable organisms in a variety of pathological conditions. It is unwise to dismiss the pathogenic capacities of any microbe in a patient with a mysterious disease.\\" Over the course of his thirty-nine-year career Domingue published numerous papers, monographs, and book chapters devoted to atypical bacterial research. He delivered many invited international and national lectures about bacterial persistence and expression of disease and wrote a book on the subject, Cell Wall-Deficient Bacteria: Basic Principles and Clinical Significance. Other research Although Domingue's primary research focus was on bacterial L-forms, he also published extensively on the biological significance of the enterobacterial common antigen of gram negative bacteria‚Äì its antigenicity, immunogenicity, and vaccine potential against urinary tract infections. He studied the immunological consequences of a vasectomy, as well as the role of various gram negative pathogens in the host-pathogen interaction in pyelonephritis, and the effects of antibiotics and chemotherapy on urinary tract infections. He also published microbiological and immunological studies on bacteria that produce chorionic gonadotropin-like hormone and their role in an experimental tumor model.

William was a monk in the Abbey of St.-Denis to the north of Paris. About 1285 he was placed in charge of the abbey library as custos cartarum, and he died in June or July 1300. Having doubtless done some work on the Latin manuscripts on which the Grandes Chroniques de France are based, William wrote a long Chronicon, dealing with the history of the world from the creation until 1300. For the period before 1113 this work merely repeats that of Sigebert of Gembloux and others; but after this date it contains some new and valuable material. The chronicle had later continuations by other authors, with the \\"second continuation\\", mainly by Jean de Venette, taking events up to 1368. William's other writings are: Gesta Ludovici IX; Gesta Philippi III, sive Audacis; Chronicon abbreviatum regum Francorum; and a French translation of the same work written for the laity. Making use of the large store of manuscripts at Saint Denis, William was a compiler rather than an author, and with the exception of the latter part of the Chronicon his writings do not add materially to our knowledge of the time. In his Gesta Ludovici IX he included a letter from Sempad the Constable to Henry I of Cyprus. Among his major sources for the reign of Louis IX was the lost Latin chronicle of Primat of Saint-Denis.Spiegel. Both his chronicles, however, became very popular and found several continuators, Jean de Joinville being among those who made use of the Chronicon. This work from 1113 to 1300, with continuations to 1368, has been edited by H. G√©raud for the Soci√©t√© de l'histoire de France (Paris, 1843), and practically all William's writings are found in the twentieth volume of Martin Bouquet's Recueil des historiens des Gaules et de la France (Paris, 1738‚Äì1876).

They have received an Andƒõl Award, granted by the Czech Academy of Popular Music, in 2005 and again in 2007, and have repeatedly placed in the top ranks of the ƒåesk√Ω slav√≠k awards.  History  The group was established in 1987 as Star√Ω Hrady (named after a village of Star√© Hrady) by Pavel Grohman and Michal Novotn√Ω (known professionally as Michal Mal√°tn√Ω). Later they modified their original name to Star√Ω hadry (Old Rags). Longtime front man Petr Rajchert and Ji≈ô√≠ Seydler joined in 1989; both were classmates of Michal Novotn√Ω. In 1994, the band renamed itself Chinaski, after the protagonist in Charles Bukowski's novels, and released an album with the same name. In September 1995, the song \\"Pojƒè si lehnout\\" (Come to Bed) saw the band's first video, directed by Jan H≈ôebejk. Chinaski's second album, Dlouhej kou≈ô (Long Smoke - 1997), brought the band greater popularity as well as a number of nominations for music awards. In 1997, Chinaski released their second video, \\"Podl√©h√°m\\" (I Succumb), directed by Vladim√≠r Mich√°lek. On 25 May 1998, Dlouhej kou≈ô won Gold certification in the Czech Republic.  Early success  Michal Mal√°tn√Ω In April 1999, the first single from the band's third album was released, titled 1. Sign√°ln√≠ (First Signal). In 2000, Petr Rajchert left and Michal Mal√°tn√Ω became the band's new front man. The group was nominated for Group of the Year by the Czech Academy of Popular Music, finishing third. Chinaski proceeded to record their fourth album, called Na na na a jin√© popjevky (Na na na and Other Ditties). The single \\"Kl√°ra\\" (Clara) was the 14th most successful track on Czech radio in its first week of release. In the vote held for the Academy Prize, Chinaski took 2nd place behind Monkey Business and ahead of Lucie. The band won fifth place again at the ƒåesk√Ω slav√≠k awards in 2001. That same year, \\"Klara\\" was the seventh most played Czech song of the year. In September 2002, a new album, titled \\"Origin√°l\\" (Original) was released, its name picked by skier Kate≈ôina Neumannov√° and the Slovak band No Name. The single \\"M≈Øj svƒõt\\" (My World) rose to first place on the IFPI TOP 40. An animated video was also created for the song. Chinaski subsequently went on tour, which was attended by a total of nearly 43 thousand people. The album Origin√°l was the second highest selling album in the Czech Republic in the first two weeks of its release. In December of the same year, a concert titled \\"Na vlastn√≠ch nohou\\" (On Our Own Feet) was held for children from schools hit by summer floods. The new single \\"L√°skopad\\" (Lovefall) garnered interest from Czech media, assuring Chinaski two top 20 singles. In December 2002, the band won gold and platinum records. They won fifth place at the ƒåesk√Ω slav√≠k awards again that year. \\"L√°skopad\\" was the 7th most popular Czech song in January 2003. At the 2003 Andƒõl Awards, Chinaski won Song of the Year with \\"1970\\". Among other things, the song deals with the generation of Hus√°k's Children. That year, the band began to prepare for the release of a compilation album. On Czech radio, another popular Chinaski song called \\"Dobr√°k od Kosti\\" (Good Man Throughout) got airplay. From July to August, they continued to perform at festivals, including a trip to Chicago. In October, they released their first compilation album titled Premium 1993 - 2003, which was christened in the Lucerna Music Bar in Prague. Chinaski took fourth place in the ƒåesk√Ω slav√≠k awards in 2003.  2003‚Äì2004  The compilation album Premium 1993 - 2003 included 18 of the band's most famous hits and three new songs, \\"Mo≈æn√°\\" (Maybe), \\"L√°ska a jin√° n√°sil√≠\\" (Love and Other Violence), and \\"1970\\". \\"1970\\" appeared in the top rank on the IFPI website. In March 2004, Chinaski launched their \\"Premium Best of Tour\\". It was the largest tour in the band's history, seeing them play exclusively large halls. The concerts were enhanced with projections and light shows. In April, they released the new single \\"Mo≈æn√°\\" (Maybe). In June and August, the band held a set of open-air concerts and performances at summer festivals. In November, the band released the album Autopoh√°dky (Car Tales). The album consists of three fairy tales narrated by the band members together with actor Ji≈ô√≠ L√°bus and musician Lucie B√≠l√°, as well as 8 new songs. The author of the stories is the late Ji≈ô√≠ Marek. On 15 November, the DVD Docela vyda≈ôenej den was released. It documents the \\"Premium Best of Tour\\" and presents the members of the band in a new light. The new single \\"L√°ska a jin√° n√°sil√≠\\" (Love and Other Violence) was also released at this time. ƒåesk√Ω slav√≠k 2004 brought the band a historic achievement, as they secured second place in the category Group of the Year and 27th place for Michal Mal√°tn√Ω in the category of Best Singer.  2005‚Äì2006  In March 2005, Chinaski began a tour to promote Autopoh√°dky. They won several Czech online music prizes and began work on a new album. The first single from that album, \\"Tab√°ƒçek\\" (Tobacco), became the most highly played song on Czech radio within a month. In September 2005, the band's sixth studio album, entitled Music Bar, was released. It sold twenty- three thousand copies within a day of its release, earning it platinum status, and within a week it had become the best-selling album in the Czech Republic. In November, Chinaski launched their biggest tour to date, which culminated in a concert at Prague's Tipsport Arena. An estimated 70,000 spectators attended the tour. On December 10, 2005, Chinaski won the ƒåesk√Ω slav√≠k award once more. On January 30, 2006, Music Bar was named best-selling album of 2005, with 57,506 copies sold. That year, Music Bar was re-released with an accompanying DVD documenting the tour, as well as additional bonus material. The set was titled Movie Bar. In May, the band launched their Chinaski Music Bar Tour through Slovakia. They followed this up with a two-week concert series in the US. In September, the single \\"Vedouc√≠\\" (Boss) became the most highly played song on Czech radio. Chinaski again left for London to perform at the sold-out Cargo nightclub on October 28. On October 21, Chinaski baptized a baby giraffe at the Prague Zoo. The band subsequently went on their Chinaski Music Club Tour - a set of shows at the best Czech clubs. The same year, Chinaski added another ƒåesk√Ω slav√≠k award to their collection in December, winning bronze in the category Best Group. After Christmas, they left for the US again, where another club tour was planned.  2007‚Äì2014  Otakar Pet≈ôina, former Chinaski member Chinaski began the year 2007 with a concert at Chicago's Club Euro, with Zuzana Norisov√° as a guest. With their video for the song \\"Vedouc√≠\\", they scored on MTV Europe's World Chart Express. They also won the prize for the band of the year at the Andƒõl Awards. Preparations for a new album with the working title 07 began. 36 songs were written in total, of which 16 made the cut. The new single \\"Zadarmo\\" (For Free) was released on July 7, 2007. A new official fan club was also launched at this time. Chinaski performed at Czech and Slovak festivals throughout the year, including Rock for People in Hradec Kr√°lov√©. After a few weeks, the single \\"Zadarmo\\" became the most played song on Czech radio. On September 17, 2007, the new album, titled 07, was released. Within a week, it had gained platinum status. In November and December, the band did a tour of indoor venues. Various promotions were offered on this tour, including an interactive page from which fans could download ringtones, pictures, and other material to their cellphones using Bluetooth before the concert. At the end of March 2008, the band flew to Ko≈°ice, Slovakia, where they started a tour with the Slovak band Desmod. During the spring, they recorded a second album in the form of fairy tales for children, titled Autopoh√°dky 2 (Car Tales 2). On July 25, 2008, tragedy struck when Pavel Grohman, drummer and lyricist for the band, crashed and died on his motorcycle. The band cancelled all concerts until further notice. At the end of August, they finished Autopoh√°dky 2 in the studio and subsequently announced a tour, with David Koller (Lucie) sitting in on drums. Among other things, they rehearsed with a new drummer, Otakar Pet≈ôina Jr., who performs under the pseudonym Marpo. In October, Autopoh√°dky 2 and the DVD Kdy≈æ Chinaski tak na≈æivo (When Chinaski Then Live) were released. In April 2010, Chinaski flew to the United States, where they conducted a mini-tour and made the acquaintance of producer Simon Sidi (Politicon), a British-born stage design expert, who agreed to work with the band on their upcoming fall tour. After returning from the USA, they started recording a new album. It was titled Nen√≠ na co ƒçekat (There's Nothing to Wait For) and came out in September of that year. This was followed by another national tour, which began on October 7 in Liberec and saw the band play in six cities. In September 2013, Chinaski released a compilation album titled 20 let v s√≠ti (20 Years in the Network), which proved to be another commercial success. On February 6, 2014, the band celebrated their 20-year anniversary with a giant concert at the O2 Arena and subsequently played at various concerts and festivals. The band's ninth studio album, titled Rockfield, was released in October 2014.  2015‚Äì2017  Nothing significant occurred for the band in 2015 apart from playing at several concerts and festivals. The following year, they held a small set of shows, culminating in October at the O2 Arena with a concert titled ƒåesk√Ω mejdan s Impulsem (Czech Party with Radio Impuls), together with other famous performers such as Karel Gott, Lucie B√≠l√°, Michal David, Dalibor Janda, Kab√°t, and others. After a few Christmas concerts, the band announced a one-year break to record a new album. In the summer of 2016, Chinaski formed the short-lived project Summer All Stars together with Slza, Xindl X, Jelen, and Miroslav ≈Ωbirka. They released the single \\"L√©to l√°sky\\" (Summer of Love) on May 8, 2016 at the ≈†ikland festival. In 2017, the band released a new album called Nen√≠ n√°m do pl√°ƒçe (We Don't Feel Like Crying), which was a great success. In the fall, they announced an indoor tour, which ended on November 16 at the sold-out O2 Arena with a very successful concert. That same year, they placed third in the ƒåesk√Ω slav√≠k awards for band of the year.  2017‚Äìpresent  Just three days after the sold-out concert at the O2 Arena, Michal Mal√°tn√Ω and Franti≈°ek T√°borsk√Ω announced the end of Chinaski's long-standing lineup on November 19, 2017. The two were the only remaining members of the band's original makeup; the other four members - ≈†tƒõp√°n ≈†koch, Ond≈ôej ≈†koch, Petr Ku≈ævart, and Otakar Pet≈ôina Jr., had all left the group. The last show with the band's classic lineup took place on December 18, 2017, for the Krtek Fund for Pediatric Oncology. According to the band's official announcement, they did not part ways on negative terms; as a reason, the group cited the loss of \\"internal chemistry\\" among its members. A new lineup was announced in early 2018: Luk√°≈° Pavl√≠k took on drumming duties, Tomi Okres joined on bass, and Jan Steinsd√∂rfer became the band's keyboardist. During 2018, the band toured a large number of concerts and summer festivals, and won several awards for their album Nen√≠ n√°m do pl√°ƒçe.

The sister of alt-country singer Steve Earle, she has recorded six albums, including four with her husband, musician Mark Stuart. Early life Earle was born in Lake Charles, Louisiana, and raised in San Antonio, Texas. She first taught herself to play a ukulele and then began playing a gut string guitar, left behind by her musician brother, Steve Earle. She was given her own guitar as a Christmas present when she was 16 years old, but became a mother at 17 and played and sang at home, developing her own style of finger picking. Career When she was 29 years old, Earle moved to Nashville to live with her brother Steve, and sang backing vocals and played rhythm guitar on his 1991 album The Hard Way, and for the subsequent world tour. She appeared on her brother's subsequent albums: Shut Up and Die Like an Aviator and Transcendental Blues. After returning from tour, she wrote songs and performed them at writer's nights in Nashville. Later, she set up her own songwriters' night to get some more time on stage. During this time, she met fellow guitarist and singer Mark Stuart who became her partner in running the events and then later became her second husband. Earle signed a contract with Nashville's Ten Ten Music Group as a staff songwriter and received notice for her song \\"For Years\\", which appeared on Sammy Kershaw's 1996 CD Politics, Religion and Her. In 1998 she released the album Simple Gearle which later appeared on The New York Times \\"Favorite CD's You Nearly Missed\\" list. Reviewer Jon Pareles stated: \\"On an album completed in four days, Stacey Earle's songs came out homespun and pristine. She examines marriage, divorce and starting over in quiet, folky vignettes full of tears and determination.\\" She has appeared at festivals, clubs and private homes performing up to 170 concerts a year. Personal life She married Michael Mimms when she was 17, and they had two sons before the marriage ended in divorce in 1990. She met her current husband Mark Stuart in 1991, and married him in 1993. They were both members of her brother's band, Steve Earle and the Dukes, as well as her own band, the Jewels (named after her grandmother Jewel Earle). She is the aunt of Justin Townes Earle, Ian Dublin Earle and John Henry Earle.

It is among the most harmful pests to coffee crops across the world where coffee is cultivated.Jaramillo J, Borgemeister C, Baker P (2006) Coffee berry borer Hypothenemus hampei (Coleoptera: Curculionidae): searching for sustainable control strategies. Bulletin of Entomological Research 96:223-233Vega FE, Infante F, Johnson AJ (2015) The genus Hypothenemus, with emphasis on H. hampei, the coffee berry borer. In: Bark Beetles: Biology and Ecology of Native and Invasive Species (F. E. Vega and R. W. Hofstetter, Eds.), pp. 427-494. Academic Press, San Diego. Spanish common names of the insect include barrenador del caf√©, gorgojo del caf√©, and broca del caf√©. Description Females have two larval stages and males only one. They have strong mandibles, and their larval phase lasts 10 to 26 days. The adults are small black beetles. Females are 1.4‚Äì1.8 mm long. The males are 1.2‚Äì1.6 mm long. Female beetles can fly short distances; males have rudimentary wings. H. hampei is confused sometimes with the false coffee berry borer (H. obscurus or H. seriatus) and Xylosandrus (Scolytidae), but these species do not enter the coffee bean endosperm. Life cycle The maturation of the insect (from egg to adult) lasts between 24 and 45 days, varying according to the weather. Usually, the female drills the berry through the central disc, although it can enter through the side walls if the fruit is dry. Two days after the access, the beetle lays 35‚Äì50 eggs, which produce 13 females for each male. The lifespan for females is 35‚Äì190 days and for males 40 days. The new insects mate inside the seed. Some females lay the eggs in the same coffee plant, others colonize new ones. The males never leave the fruit. The same plant can host three to five generations of beetles. Up to 100 beetles can be found in a single fruit. The insect is very sensitive to desiccation, and waits for the rains to leave the fruit. The most affected areas in the crops are the shady and moist ones. Colonisation Entry hole Coffee borer beetle entering and exiting a coffee cherry. The main host of H. hampei is Coffea arabica, but other coffee species have been affected in some cases. The female beetles attack the fruits from 8 weeks past the flowering to 32 weeks. When the insect enters, it builds galleries in the endosperm where the eggs are deposited. Distribution The insect is endemic to central Africa and has now spread to most coffee-producing countries through the accidental introduction of contaminated seeds. The first report in the American continent were in Brazil (1926).The entry to Java is dated about 1909 and Borneo in 1919. In the 1970s, it affected Guatemala and Mexico. The beetle entered Colombia during the late 1980s. It entered the Dominican Republic in the 1990s. It was detected in Puerto Rico in August 2007. It was discovered in Kona (Big Island), Hawaii in August 2010.Burbano E, Wright M, Bright DE, Vega FE (2011) New record for the coffee berry borer, Hypothenemus hampei, in Hawaii. Journal of Insect Science 11:117. Genome and caffeine detoxification The draft genome of the coffee berry borer consists of ca. 163 million base pairs (Vega et al. 2015 . Caffeine demethylase has been shown to be responsible for caffeine breakdown in the alimentary canal of the insect (Ceja-Navarro et al. 2015 . Pest management The presence of the insect affects the economy of over 20 million families that depend on the coffee harvest. Due to the losses in yield and quality caused by the insect, growers end up losing significant amounts of income. The main pest management strategies involve different components, including monitoring, controlled harvest, and the use of biological control agents. Prevention Prevention is based in the careful inspection of the coffee beans before leaving the coffee farms to avoid spreading of the insects. Also, a number of border controls has been established in countries with coffee crops. Chemical control Insecticides are useful only before the female beetle penetrates the berry. Resistance to endosulfan, which has been banned in many countries, has been reported in New Caledonia. Biological control Biological control methods use the natural enemies of the coffee berry borer to reduce the population. Pest management through biological control can utilize predators, parasites and diseases that attack the larvae or adult beetles. Birds During the time when beetle offspring emerge from each commercially ruined berry to disperse, they are vulnerable to predation. The yellow warbler, rufous-capped warbler, and other insectivorous birds have been shown to reduce by 50% the number of coffee borer beetles in Costa Rican coffee plantations. Parasitoids The parasitoids used to control the borer beetle are Hymenoptera (wasps) native to Africa. Although they have a low impact in the beetle population, the use of biological controls allows the product to qualify as organic food. *Bethylid parasitoids (Bethylidae): Cephalonomia stephanoderis Betrem and Prorops nasuta Waterston were introduced in some Latin American countries from Africa during the 1980s and 1990s with low success. In the late 1990s, the C. hyalinipennis native of North America was described as attacking the borer beetle in Chiapas, south of Mexico. This species preys on the eggs of H. hampei. Another useful betylid is Sclerodermus cadavericus Benoit, but its management is difficult, since it is an aggressive wasp and can cause severe dermatitis. *'Eulophyd parasitoids (Eulophidae): Phymastichus coffea was discovered in Togo in 1987. It attacks the adult beetle, and mass-rearing in Colombia has been successful. It has a capacity to stay in the coffee crops for a long time. *Braconid parasitoids (Braconidae): Heterospilus coffeicola Schmiedeknecht was observed in Uganda, but its reproduction in laboratories has been unsuccessful. Insect predators Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) have been reported as predators of H. hamper but they do not control the insect. Research at the Centro Nacional de Investigaciones de Caf√© (Cenicaf√©, Colombia) reported other insect families as predators: Anthocoridae (Hemiptera) and Cucujidae (Coleoptera). The following are the genus and species that have been reported to attack the borer beetle: *Formicidae: Solenopsis, Pheidole, Wasmannia, Paratrechina, Crematogaster, Brachymyrmex and Prenolepis *Anthocoridae: Calliodes and Scoloposcelis *Cucujidae: Cathartus quadricollis (Gu√©rin-M√©neville) Nematodes Metaparasitylenchus hypothenemi (Nematoda: Allantonematidae) has been reported in Mexico. A Panagrolaimus sp. has been reported in the field in India. In laboratory experiments, Heterorhabditis sp. and Steinernema feltiae have been shown to infect the insect. Fungal entomopathogens Beauveria bassiana infection causes high mortality of the insect and products have been developed in Colombia and elsewhere. Other fungi recorded to attack CBB include: Hirsutella eleutheratorum, Isaria sp. (previously placed in the genus Paecilomyces), and Metarhizium sp.

He produced a number of works in German and other languages, including the first regarding the nature printing process. He was the director of the Austrian State Printing House, which created illustrated volumes of scientific interest and produced many advances in printing technology. His name, in the full title of the hereditary knighthood he was given, is Alois Auer Ritter von Welsbach (Knight of Welsbach). Biography Born in Wels, Austria, Auer was trained as a compositor, and in his leisure moments studied French, Italian, English, and other languages, in which he underwent an examination in 1835 and 1836 at the University of Vienna. Auer's early career began in October 1837 with an appointment as professor of Italian at a gymnasium in Linz. He acquired fluency in other languages during his travels in Germany, Switzerland, France, and England. That trip began in 1839. He studied the typographical techniques he would use when he became director of the printing office of the Viennese court in 1841. The ornamental typefaces he implemented allowed greater flexibility in printing, and the enterprise was to become highly successful, meeting the requirements of 500 European dialects (exclusive of those Russian, Turkish, and Hebrew), and almost 150 languages of the world. Under his management, the Imperial printing office became one of the largest establishments of the kind in Europe. He remained there until 1868. The first published work on 'nature printing' (German: Naturselbstdruck), was The Discovery of the Nature Printing-Process (1853).Vienna: K.K Hof- und Staatsdruckerei, 1853. 4 volumes, printed paper wrappers; Italian, French, English, German. In this he detailed the use of actual plant material, rocks and lace, impressed upon lead or into gum, to demonstrate what he saw as a major advance in the productions of botanical works. His intention was to produce 'artistical-scientific objects', while greatly reducing the problems of producing herbaries and other works of natural history. Another illustrator, Henry Bradbury, began producing work by a similar process after seeing Auer's invention. The interest in the natural sciences, physics, and languages was met by publications that included his own works. The various printing processes and an extensive history of the Staatsdruckerei, state printing house itself. Apart from the volumes and plates produced by the nature printing process, he also produced some of the earliest books to incorporate photographs. The publication of photomicrography is given to be the first. thumb|230 px|\\"Polygraphie\\" by Alois Auer (albumenized salt photographic print) 1853 He invented a 'typometrical' system, facilitating the use of a large number of foreign alphabets with ornamental type to be used in printing. This was described in his work \\"Der polygraphische Apparat der Wiener k. k. Hof- und Staatsdruckerei\\" (\\"The Polygraphical Apparatus of the Viennese k. k. Court and State Printer\\"). Auer's directorship at the Royal and State Printing oversaw many advances in automatic high-speed press, copperplate press, and new typographical processes. In Vienna in 1858, Auer patented a web press that printed newspapers from a continuous roll of paper; the press was developed in the United States by William Bullock five years later.Consuegra, David, American Type Design and Designers.

In order to start a co-operation with the Finnish Air Force, the headquarters of Veljekset Karhum√§ki was moved to Kuorevesi. During World War II the company was merged into the Valtion lentokonetehdas company, manufacturer of a number of military aircraft. The Karhum√§ki brothers designed the Karhum√§ki Karhu 48B light airplane, of which a small number was produced during the 1950s. In 1950, Karhum√§ki Airways was founded by Veljekset Karhum√§ki, an airline initially offering scheduled passenger flights on mostly domestic routes. In 1963, Aero O/Y (today's Finnair) acquired the majority of its stake, and in 1996 Karair (as it was known by then) was fully absorbed into Finnair.

It used a natural ravine that was between the City of Columbia and the Congaree and Broad Rivers. The canal started between Lumber (currently Calhoun) and Richland Streets. It ran along the Congaree for about 3.1 mi (5 km). It ended across from Granby Landing just north of the current railroad bridges across the Congaree. The canal was completed in 1824. It was 12 ft (3.7 m) wide and 2.5 ft (0.8 m) deep north of Senate St. South of Senate St., the canal was 18 ft (5.5 m) wide and 4 ft (1.2 m) deep. It had an 8 ft (2.4 m) wide towpath on either side. The canal had four lifting locks and one guard lock for the 34 ft (10 m) descent of the river. A diversion dam was built across the Broad River to allow access from the Saluda Canal. There were three waste weirs to prevent flooding of the canal. A separate canal, which was called Bull Sluice, was constructed north of Columbia Canal on the Broad River, This ¬Ω mi (0.8 km) long canal had one lock. The 1891 canal extended the Columbia Canal upstream of Bull Sluice. In 1840, the State of South Carolina dropped its subsidy of the canal. In 1842, the railroads came to Columbia and the traffic on the canal decreased. During the Civil War, the hydraulic power of the canal was used to make gunpowder. Mills that used the canal for power were a grist mill run by the State Penitentiary, another grist mill, and a saw mill. Portions of the 1824 canal south of Gervais St. survive today. Also parts of the Bull Sluice canal remain. 1891 Canal 250px In 1888, the canal was redesigned as an industrial power source. The revised design started at Gervais St. and extended about 3¬Ω mi(5.6 km) north along the Congaree and Broad Rivers. It was about 150 ft (46 m) wide and 10 ft (3 m) deep. It included a new diversion dam, an entry lock, and a waste weir. It was opened in 1891. The Columbia Mill was built on high ground north of Gervais St. To power the alternating current motors in the mills, a powerhouse was built on the canal about 600 ft (183 m) away. This made it the first textile mill in the world to use AC motors and generate power away from the mill. The Columbia Hydro plant was built at the southern end of the canal. This produced power for industry, the City of Columbia, and the street railway system. It was once operated by the South Carolina Electric & Gas Co. 2008 In September 2008, the St Columbia division of the Ancient Order of Hibernians dedicated a memorial to the Irish canal workers that built the Columbia Canal. Known as the South Carolina Irish Memorial, this granite memorial pays tribute to the Irish workers that built and also died digging this canal, many that are buried at the nearby St. Peter's Catholic Church. 2015 As a result of catastrophic flooding in early October, the canal was breached. The South Carolina Army National Guard is currently working to repair the breach.http://www.thestate.com/news/local/article37791075.html See also * List of canals in the United States  References  External links * Category:Canals on the National Register of Historic Places in South Carolina Category:Canals in South Carolina Category:Transportation in Columbia, South Carolina Category:Buildings and structures in Columbia, South Carolina Category:Historic American Engineering Record in South Carolina Category:National Register of Historic Places in Columbia, South Carolina Category:Canals opened in 1824 Category:Canals opened in 1893 ","title":"Columbia Canal"},{"id":"13050539","text":"Brazilian athlete Wendel Silva Soares in the 400 m wheelchair race at the 2007 Parapan American Games Wheelchair racing is the racing of wheelchairs in track and road races. Wheelchair racing is open to athletes with any qualifying type of disability, amputees, spinal cord injuries, cerebral palsy and partially sighted (when combined with another disability). Athletes are classified in accordance with the nature and severity of their disability or combinations of disabilities. Like running, it can take place on a track or as a road race. The main competitions take place at the Summer Paralympics which wheelchair racing and athletics has been a part of since 1960. Competitors compete in specialized wheelchairs which allow the athletes to reach speeds of 30 km/h (18.6 mph) or more. It is one of the most prominent forms of Paralympic athletics.  History  The World Wars significantly influenced society's view and treatment of individuals with disabilities. Before the wars, individuals with disabilities were considered as burdens on society. As many veterans of war returned home with physical impairments and psychological needs, new programs had to be put in place to help make the transition back into society, as traditional methods were not able to accommodate. The British government is credited with being the first to recognize these needs by opening the Spinal Injuries Centre at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury, England, in 1944. Sir Ludwig Guttmann, director of this center, introduced competitive sports as an integral part of the rehabilitation of disabled veterans. A men's wheelchair racer at the 2015 Tokyo Marathon Samantha Kinghorn at the 2016 Summer Paralympic Games, T53 100 metres sprint. With Guttmann's guidance, the first Stoke Mandeville Games for the Paralyzed were held in 1948. In the late 1940s, sports for rehabilitation spread throughout Europe and throughout the United States. During this time competitions and sporting events for individuals in wheelchairs emerged throughout Europe. In 1952 the first international competition for athletes in wheelchairs was organized between the British and the Netherlands. A total of 130 athletes with spinal cord injuries competed in six sports. To honor the social and human value derived from the wheelchair sport movement, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) recognized Guttmann's work in 1956 and awarded the Stoke Mandeville Games the Sir Thomas Fearnley Cup for meritorious achievement in service to the Olympic movement. Since the beginning of the games in Stoke Mandeville wheelchair sports has expanded with the addition of many sports. Beginning with wheelchair archery, lawn bowls, table tennis, shot put, javelin, and club throw were added to the growing list. In the 1960s wheelchair basketball, fencing, snooker and weightlifting were also introduced. In 1960 the International Stoke Mandeville Wheelchair Sports Federation (ISMWSF) was formed to allow all international competitions for individuals with spinal cord injuries. Although originally sanctioned for those with spinal cord injuries, these games were expanded in 1976 at the Olympiad for the Physically Disabled in Toronto, Canada, to include other physical and visual impairments and would evolve and eventually be referred to as the Paralympics. In the 1960s international sports competitions were expanded to include other disability groups who were not eligible for the World Games. In addition, the International Sports Organisation for the Disabled (ISOD) was officially formed in Paris in 1964, to provide international sports opportunities for the blind, amputees and persons with other loco motor disabilities.  Events  View from above of wheelchair racing competition at the 2000 Summer Paralympics The distances involved in wheelchair racing include sprint distances of 100 m (109.4 yards), 200 m (218.7 yards) and 400 m (437.4 yards), middle distances of 800 m (874.9 yards) and 1500 m (1640.4 yards), long distances of 5000 m (3.1 miles) and 10,000 m (6.2 miles) and relay races of 4 √ó 100 m (109.4 yards) and 4 √ó 400 m (437.4 yards). There is also a road event which is the wheelchair marathon. Athletes who are in a wheelchair can also participate in field events as well; these include shot put, javelin, and discus. There are also combined events such as the pentathlon, where the athlete participates in track and road events, and jumping and throwing events, depending on the athletes' disability and classification.  Classifications  Classification systems have been put into place to ensure that the competition is fair, ensuring that all of the competitors have an equal opportunity to place, and they can because of their talent and not because their disability was less severe than the other competitors. Athletes are divided into categories depending on their disability, these are spinal cord injury or an amputee, or cerebral palsy. The classification guidelines are continually being changed to include more athletes. Athletes who are in a wheelchair due to spinal cord injury or are an amputee are in classes T51 ‚Äì T58. Classes T51 ‚Äì T54 are for athletes in a wheelchair who are competing in track events, and classes T55 ‚Äì T58 are for athletes who are competing in field events. An athlete who is classed as T54 is completely functional from the waist up. An athlete who is classed as T53 has restricted movement in their abdominals. An athlete who is classed as either T52 or T51 has restricted movement in their upper limbs. Athletes who are in a wheelchair due to cerebral palsy have different guidelines compared to an athlete with a spinal cord injury or who is an amputee, and range between T32 ‚Äì T38. Classes T32 ‚ÄìT34 are classes for athletes in a wheelchair and classes T35 ‚Äì T38 are for athletes who can stand.  Rules and regulations for wheelchairs  Wheelchairs are a necessary piece of equipment for athletes competing in wheelchair racing and track and field events. Many of the wheelchairs tend to be very lightweight, with pneumatic tires, and with the dimensions and features on the wheelchairs clearly specified in the IPC Athletics rules. There are rules for each event regarding the athletes' equipment. The rules are: Rule 159 Para 1 The wheelchair shall have at least two large wheels and one small wheel. Rule 159 Para 2 No part of the body of the chair may extend forwards beyond the hub of the front wheel and be wider than the inside of the hubs of the two rear wheels. The maximum height from the ground of the main body of the chair shall be 50 cm (1.6 ft). Rule 159 Para 3 The maximum diameter of the large wheel including the inflated tyre shall not exceed 70 cm (2.3 ft). The maximum diameter of the small wheel including the inflated tyre shall not exceed 50 cm (1.6 ft). Rule 159 Para 4 Only one plain, round, hand rim is allowed for each large wheel. This rule may be waived for persons requiring a single arm drive chair, if so stated on their medical and Games identity cards. Rule 159 Para 5 No mechanical gears or levers shall be allowed, that may be used to propel the chair. Rule 159 Para 6 Only hand-operated, mechanical steering devices will be allowed. Rule 159 Para 7 In all races of 800 metres or over, the athlete should be able to turn the front wheel(s) manually both to the left and the right. Rule 159 Para 8 The use of mirrors is not permitted in track or road races. Rule 159 Para 9 No part of the chair may protrude behind the vertical plane of the back edge of the rear tyres. Rule 159 Para 10 It will be the responsibility of the competitor to ensure the wheelchair conforms to all the above rules, and no event shall be delayed whilst a competitor makes adjustments to the athletes chair. Rule 159 Para 11 Chairs will be measured in the Marshalling Area, and may not leave that area before the start of the event. Chairs that have been examined may be liable to re-examination before or after the event by the official in charge of the event. Rule 159 Para 12 It shall be the responsibility, in the first instance, of the official conducting the event, to rule on the safety of the chair. Rule 159 Para 13 Athletes must ensure that no part of their lower limbs can fall to the ground or track during the event.

It is contained in human breath and sweat, and it was once believed that insect repellent DEET worked by blocking the insects' octenol odorant receptors. Recent evidence in Anopheles gambiae and Culex quequinfasciatius mosquitoes suggest DEET reduces the volatility of 1-octen-3-ol which can result in a reduction in human attraction. 1-Octen-3-ol is a secondary alcohol derived from 1-octene. It exists in the form of two enantiomers, (R)-(‚Äì)-1-octen-3-ol and (S)-(+)-1-octen-3-ol.  Natural occurrence Octenol is produced by several plants and fungi, including edible mushrooms and Lemon balm. Octenol is formed during oxidative breakdown of linoleic acid. It is also a wine fault, defined as a cork taint, occurring in wines made with bunch rot contaminated grape. Uses Octenol is used, sometimes in combination with carbon dioxide, to attract insects in order to kill them with certain electronic devices. The name 'mushroom alcohol' is used because octenol is the main flavour component of mushrooms. Health and safety Octenol is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a food additive. It is of moderate toxicity with an LD50 of 340 mg/kg. In an animal study, octenol has been found to disrupt dopamine homeostasis and may be an environmental agent involved in parkinsonism.

It had a population of 1,615 in the 2001 census, but by 2011 this had risen to 1,900.  History   Roman  Excavations on Leech Lane, off Hill End towards Cullingworth have suggested Roman settlement in the area from c.150 AD. Archaeologists have, in the past unearthed pottery, coins and even Elephant-Ivory on this site suggesting that an Anglo-Roman villa may have stood here. There is a small section of Roman Road on Harden Moor that points in a rough north east direction. The route is lined with stones that have deep cart-groove marks.  Industrial  Between 1960 and 1997, Harden's biggest employer was Ellison Circlips. The huge factory adjoined another smaller factory producing similar products. On 24 February 1979, Ellison's Mill caught fire in the computer room and the resultant blaze gutted the timber floored mill. The outer stone walls stayed upright during the fire, but because of the threat of explosions from the acid baths if they came into contact with water, two houses were evacuated as a precaution. The factories were bounded on the south by Long Lane (the B6429) on the east by Keighley Road, on the west by Effingham Road and the north by fields leading up to Harden Moor. The company relocated to Glusburn in 1997 and the factory was demolished to make way for housing. At least two other mills were in operation in Harden, both situated alongside Harden Beck to the south of the village. One of the mills is still there and now operates as a printing works. The other mill was further upstream from the existing mill and during the early part of the 20th century was turned into a caf√© and ballroom. It was destroyed by fire in 1927.  Artistic  Woodbank, an area to the east of Harden and south of the B6429, played host to some of the Pre-Raphaelite movement. Many of the stained glass works around Bingley, Bradford and Silsden (including the Church of All Saints, Bingley) were designed by Burne-Jones. Facilities Harden has two churches, one Congregational and the other one is St Saviours Church in the newly created benefice of Cullingworth, Denholme, Harden & Wilsden. Harden Primary School has been in existence since 1877 and the school still uses some of the Victorian buildings to this day. There is also a Post Office, a convenience store, a garden centre and an independent butcher's. There is a village park which contains a large square piece of land that hosts the annual gala during the summer. Harden is the location of the St. Ive's Estate, a large stretch of land with woodland and a well-equipped children's playpark, as well as paths up to moorland. St Ive's also contains an 18-hole golf course and golf club. There is a beautician and a hairdresser in Long Lane, opposite Harden Primary School's car park. Harden has an establishment which holds drama plays every year, it is located in the centre of Harden. Harden Road in the village of Harden looking east towards Bingley Harden has a cricket club which has been in existence since at least 1950. They play matches on a pitch adjacent to the hamlet of Cuckoo's Nest on the east side of Harden village. Harden and District WI is based in Harden. It was formed in 1962 and meets monthly on the 2nd Monday in the Family Room of St Saviour‚Äôs Church.  Transport  First Bradford buses run from Bradford Interchange to Bingley through the village. The service, number 616, goes from Bradford through Four Lane Ends, Allerton, Sandy Lane Cross Roads, Wilsden and then into Harden before going on into Bingley. There is a half-hourly service through the day Mondays to Saturdays with additions in the peaks. Sundays sees an hourly service. Most evening services extend into Eldwick (along the route of the 615) and also start their journeys back from there. TLC buses provide the services 727/729 which goes from Keighley to Cullingworth via East Morton, Bingley Railway station, and into Harden village. During the day these services split their routes every hour with the 729 going direct to Cullingworth via the B6429, and the 727 going south to Wilsden first, then Harecroft and then into Cullingworth. The return journeys are the reverse of the above; but all 727/729 services will call at Harden, which gives an hourly service to Cullingworth, Keighley and Bingley, with Wilsden being a two-hourly service. Events ;Harden Gala There is an annual gala in Harden park in the summer, which has races, jokes and a parade processing down Long Lane past the school and the church. The parade generally consists of themed floats from the Harden Players' (a local drama club and the primary school) and then the gala queen's float with her two attendants, all dressed up in evening wear with bouquets of flowers. A marching band leads the procession and Harden pre- school brings up the rear in costume. Harden & District WI have a stall selling homemade cakes, plants and produce. ;Harden Show Every September the Harden Beck Horticultural Society hold a show between the Golden Fleece public house and the former dam area. The society and show have been in existence for over 50 years. ;Harden Players Harden Players is a local drama club that puts on productions roughly twice a year, with children and adults, ages ranging from 4 to about 54. In recent years they have presented enjoyable pantomimes as well as Macbeth. ;St Ives Medieval Fayre Every summer, St Ive's holds a medieval \\"fayre\\", with jugglers, jousting and other entertainments. Medieval tents are set up on the top field and demonstrations show how simple tasks like the washing up and making a tent peg would have been done. Media A few short shots of footage of Harden are available on the British Film Institute (BFI) website on the BFI Player along with footage of the 1968 Miss Blackpool Beauty Contest. The whole short appears to have been filmed in 1968 and shows a shot of the Malt Shovel where Harden and Wilsden meet, the parade of shops with the Post Office and Snowdon's Butcher's shop, part of Wilsden Road and a shot of the weir at the bottom of Harden Road in Bingley.

For other uses see Siddha Yoga (disambiguation) The Ganges river at Shankar Math, a Siddhayoga retreat The Tirtha lineage of Siddhayoga is a mystical sect of Shaivite Hinduism that relies on direct experience of life-force or Kundalini Shakti and understanding of Tantric scriptures (shastras). It holds the guru- disciple relationship to be of primary importance. Shakti is said to be automatically infused into the disciple (shisya) by the Guru\\"The easy way of attaining it (salvation) is said to be Siddhayoga...Siddhayoga or Siddhimarga is that means by which yoga (union) can be attained without difficulty...Siddhayoga is attained by the infusion of spiritual force through the good grace of a saintly preceptor...Siddhayoga or Siddhimarga is nothing but the knowledge of the unity of Self and Brahma...\\" in a process called Shaktipat. (see also Satguru) There are many Siddhayoga lineages and many other groups not using the name that speak in terms of the infusion of kundalini shakti. Some lineages originated from the same source, others are completely unrelated.Siddha Mahayoga FAQ Siddhayoga is similar to sahajayoga, mahayoga or siddhamahayoga. Similar teachings may be traced back at least to the Tantric masters such as the scholar Abhinavagupta.Siddha Mahayoga FAQ Shakti is held to be the energy of a universal soul, of which direct experience is available regardless of religion; thus siddhayoga is sometimes considered a universal rather than a strictly Hindu practice. Scriptural sources Siddha yoga guru Narayan Dev Tirtha Siddhayoga aims to uncover an eternal source of abundance for all to share ‚Äì peace, creativity, spiritual energy and eternal soul. The guru makes this happen for the disciple.Swami Sadashiva Tirtha. Founder, Swami Narayan Tirtha Math; Author, Bhagavad Gita for Modern Time& Ayurveda Encyclopedia. Personal conversation, 2007 Its most important text is the Yoga Vani. The siddhayoga guru prepares the kundalini shakti which automatically gets infused in the disciple at the muladhara chakra, awakening and raising spiritual energy up the SushumnaYoga Vani, 2 Various ancient texts discuss this effect of nearness to the guru. The Kularnava Tantraquoted in Yoga Vani, 28 has; \\"An intelligent person should regard this teacher as their preceptor by whose contact inexpressible bliss is produced in the disciple.\\" and the Yoga Vasistha quoted in Yoga Vani 27 confirms; \\"A real preceptor is one who can produce blissful sensation in the body of the disciple by their sight, touch, or instructions.\\" Siddhayoga is said to be an internal transformation, allowing a person to grow more into their nature regardless of their outer path, rites and rituals; what they do and how they do it in the outer world is unique to their own individual path (dharma). One who yearns to connect with their soul or God, who strives for mental peace and harmony with all people, animals, and nature, who tries to live in balance with nature's rhythms and who aims to live purposefully will find these higher desires fulfilled in experiencing of soul and developing of inner divine love. Siddhayoga lineage Sri Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirthaji Maharaj Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha descended from two monastic lines. He was first initiated into Siddhayoga by Swami Narayana Dev Tirtha [born circa 1879], whose own spiritual lineage was through Swami Gangadhara Tirtha. Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha then took sannyas under Jagadguru Shankaracharya Swami Bharati Krsna Tirtha in Puri. During Jagadguru Shankaracharya Swami Bharati Krsna Tirthaji's visit to America, Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha was asked to maintain the holy seat of Shankaracharya of Puri Govardhan Mutt. Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirthaji was not keen to be bound by the obligations pertaining to the office of Shankaracharya, including administrative responsibilities. His greater objective was to spread the thought of God among all people. As a result, brushing aside the honour of and fascination for the position of Shankaracharya, he set out, proceeding to the north in the direction of the Himalayas, always an attraction to yogis, seers, and sages as the ideal place for sadhana. The King of Tehri Garhwal, appreciative of the blessings he received from Swamiji, expressed his desire to donate a vast stretch of land by the Ganga, but Swamiji accepted only a modest plot after repeated entreaties of the king. Thus, the ashrama named \\"Shankar Math\\" Uttarkashi was established in 1933. Later, another Math in Varanasi's Chhoti Gaibi, named \\"Siddhayogashram\\" was founded in 1934. Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha wrote several books such as Yogavani, Japa Sadhana, and Guruvani which were originally written in Bengali, later translated into Hindi. He also wrote a short treatise in English, entitled Who Am I?Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha's Yoga Vani: Instructions for the Attainment of Siddhayoga and Guru Bani: 100 Ways to Attain Inner Peace have been published in Bengali, Hindi, and English by Purushottam Publishers ordered by HH Swami Atmananda Tirtha Ji Maharaj - Mathadhyaksha of Siddhayogashram, Varanasi. Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha [1888-1958] was the guru of Swami Narayana Tirtha [ -2001]. Swami Vishnu Tirtha was another disciple of Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha. He was initiated in 1939. Swami Shivom Tirtha, a disciple of Swami Vishnu Tirtha, has a website dedicated to him that explains the Tirtha Siddhayoga lineage tree in more detail. The Tirtha lineage of Jagadguru Shankaracharya Swami Bharati Krsna Tirtha [1884-1960] traces itself back to Sri Adi Shankaracharya. In legend the lineage (parampara) began when Lord Narayana passed the eternal Vedic wisdom to Brahma, Brahma to Vasishtha, onto Shakti, to Parashara, to Veda Vyasa, and to Shuka. Thus far the lineage was from father to son. From Shuka it was passed on from guru to shishya, to Patanjali, then to Gaudapada, Govinda, Chandra Sharma and so to Adi Shankara. This began the tradition of wandering monks. Vyasa told Govinda of the advent of the incarnation of Shiva as Adi Shankara, to meet and give him sanyas diksha, Shankara's purpose in incarnating was to comment on the Brahma Sutras. Shankaracharya set up four religious seats in the north, south, east and west of India to act as a lighthouse to guide religious seekers towards the truth for the millennia to come and also set up the ten monastic orders. 1) Tirtha, 2) Ashrama, 3) Vana, 4) Aranya, 5) Giri, 6) Parvata, 7) Sagara, 8) Saraswati, 9) Bharati, 10) Puri. Faith in the guru ::\\"Keep firm in faith unfathomable. Faith is samƒÅdhi - nothing more.\\" As with much Hindu or Vedic mysticism, Siddhayoga's goal of life is to realize one is eternal soul and not this body. Suffering is said to be caused by identifying with body, emotions, or thoughts, rather than with true nature.Yoga Vani, 9-10 The rules of a discipline may become unnatural because they are artificially imposed: even when doing one's best to remain balanced and free one often finds oneself once again bound. Siddhayoga says that through the grace of a Siddhayoga guru all the work is done for you. You do not force anything; you are not charged anything or asked for anything by the guru ‚Äì so there is no conflict of interest.Yoga Vani, 30 One gains peace through direct experience of peace, not from intellectual knowledge of peace. Once peace is felt, the intellect confirms it. This does not suggest people get a 'free ride' by following a Siddhayoga guru. Siddhayoga is said to be for those people who take responsibility for their lives, who are self-reliant, whose focus in life is to help others, the creatures, and Mother Nature, who aim for inner and outer balance in life, eat sensiblyYoga Vani, 80-88. and healthfully, live a life of moderation and seek to be purposeful in life. ::birds cannot fly in the air with the help of a single wing, but they can do so with the help of both. So the devotee cannot move in the spiritual atmosphere leading to Salvation with the help of knowledge of yoga alone. The devotee can attain salvation with the help of both knowledge and yoga.Yoga Vani, 5-6. Current Siddhayoga Gurus and Ashramas India Baba & his successors On 2 March 2001, Swami Narayana Tirtha died at Siddhayogashram in Varanasi. Swami Atmananda Tirtha, who is a disciple and successor of Swami Narayana Tirtha, is the current Mathadhyaksha of all the ashramas in India - including the Siddhayoga Ashram in Varanasi and the Shankar Math in Uttar-Kashi. He speaks and writes fluently in Bengali, Hindi, and English. Shankar Math is located in Uttarkashi, in the Himalayas (State: Uttaranchal). It was donated to Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha by the raja (king) of the region, who received blessings from Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha. Siddhayogashram is located in Chhoti Gaibi, Varanasi, and was built by Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha's disciples who wished him to live closer to them, since, in those days, a visit to Shankar Math in Uttarkashi required one to trek on mountainous terrain for 2 weeks from Rishikesh. America Swami Narayana Tirtha's successor in America is Swami Sadashiva Tirtha. He speaks English, Hindi and Bengali and has studied Ayurveda, Jyotish, and Vastu shastras. He is the author of Bhagavad Gita for Modern Times, and the Ayurveda Encyclopedia. Swami Narayan Tirtha Math was founded by Swami Sadashiva Tirtha in New York, USA.

In addition to running for a seat in the National Assembly, Jackou also ran for a seat on the municipal council of Dakoro in 2004.\\"Cheiffou Amadou √©lu conseiller municipal\\", Roue de l'Histoire, number 488, 31 December 2009 .

Jackou also opposed the election of Seyni Oumarou to replace Amadou.\\"Niger impasse continues\\", Sapa-AFP, June 5, 2007. Like the leaders of the PNDS, Jackou was outspoken in his condemnation of attempts to extend President Mamadou Tandja's term beyond December 2009, when it was originally scheduled to end. At a rally on 22 December 2008 in Niamey, Jackou called such attempts a \\"nightmarish\\" \\"coup d'√©tat\\" by the government's supporters.Mandat pr√©sidentiel au Niger : L‚Äôopposition contre la prolongation apr√®s 2009.

Sixth Republic Jackou and the PNA-Aloumat chose to participate in the October 2009 parliamentary election, which was boycotted by the major opposition parties. In an August 2009 interview, Jackou explained that the PNA-Aloumat decided to participate because doing so was necessary \\"to ensure the survival of our party\\"; he said that participation in elections was essential to the purpose of a political party and that he had no interest in leading a party that did not take part in elections. He cited the example of the opposition boycott of the 1996 parliamentary election, which he said was a mistake. Despite his decision to participate in the election, Jackou said in the same interview that his party was not breaking with the broader opposition. Regarding the August 2009 constitutional referendum, Jackou said that he supported the move to a presidential system of government, noting that he had long favored such a system, but he was critical of other constitutional changes; he said that the proposed Senate would serve no meaningful legislative purpose and would only delay legislation, while wasting money. Standing as a PNA-Aloumat candidate, Jackou was re-elected to the National Assembly in October 2009; he was again the only PNA-Aloumat candidate to win a seat.Siradji Sanda, \\"Point de presse du ministre d'Etat, ministre de l'Int√©rieur de la S√©curit√© publique et de la D√©centralisation sur la proclamation des r√©sultats d√©finitifs des √©lections l√©gislatives : 112 des 113 d√©put√©s retenus\\", Le Sahel, 11 November 2009 . The National Assembly began meeting for the new parliamentary term on November 14,Page on 2009 election at IPU-PARLINE website. and Jackou presided over the initial meetings due to his status as the oldest Deputy in the National Assembly. In his opening speech, Jackou described the new National Assembly as the best one Niger had ever had, while he also stressed the importance of the National Assembly's work: \\"We have no margin for error. We are true representatives of the people and we face enormous challenges.\\" Although customary practice would have the oldest deputy (the pr√©sident du bureau d'√¢ge) presiding for only a very brief time before the National Assembly elected a President to lead its work, Jackou said that, because a new constitution had been promulgated since the previous parliamentary term, it was first necessary for the National Assembly to formulate and adopt new internal regulations that would fit the new constitutional structure. Consequently, nine deputies, including Jackou, were chosen to sit on an ad hoc technical committee that was tasked with formulating the new internal regulations.Siradji Sanda, \\"C√©r√©monie officielle d'installation de l'Assembl√©e nationale : mise en place du bureau d'√¢ge et d√©but des d√©bats sur l'√©lection du pr√©sident de l'institution\\" , Le Sahel, 16 November 2009 .

In the local elections held on 27 December 2009, Jackou was elected as a municipal councillor in Dakoro. On 18 February 2010, President Tandja was ousted in a military coup d'√©tat.

As a deputy from a small party, Jackou has been active in voting reform legislation, supporting the introduction of a single ballot for the 2009 elections, but also proposing the scrapping of rules requiring French language ability among candidates, and supporting national single lists for some Assembly seats.\\"Niger introduces single ballot paper for all elections\\" , African Press Agency, 11 June 2008.

He argued that the level of compensation was reasonable when compared to that received by parliamentarians in neighboring countries.\\"President of Niger endorses controversial law on MP's wages\\" , African Press Agency, 14 March 2008. Press owner Jackou also owns a weekly newspaper based in Niamey, La Roue de l'Histoire. On 18 May 2002, he was arrested, along with the paper's publisher, for comments criticizing Prime Minister Hama Amadou, as well as comments directed at Minister of Trade Seini Oumarou. Jackou was eventually sentenced to a four-month suspended sentence, a 100,000 CFAF fine, and the paper was forced to pay 2 million CFAF damages to the two officials.\\"Attacks on the Press 2002: Niger\\", Committee to Protect Journalists, 2003.

A syndicate can annually receive thousands of submissions, from which only two or three might be selected for representation. In some cases, the work will be owned by the syndicate as opposed to the creator. The Guinness World Record for the world's most syndicated strip belongs to Jim Davis' Garfield, which at that point (2002) appeared in 2,570 newspapers, with 263 million readers worldwide. Syndication peaked in the mid-1930s with 130 syndicates offering 1,600 features to more than 13,700 newspapers. Harvey, Robert C. The Art of the Funnies: An Aesthetic History. University Press of Mississippi, 1994. As of 2017, the leading strip syndicates are Andrews McMeel Syndication, King Features Syndicate,Dwyer, Ed. \\"CULTURE: The Funny Papers: Newspapers may be in trouble, but the comic strip is alive and well ‚Äî and flourishing online,\\" Saturday Evening Post (November 7, 2016). and Creators Syndicate, with the Tribune Content Agency and The Washington Post Writers Group also in the running. Andrews McMeel syndicates more than 150 comic strips and news features. Andrews McMeel also owns and operates GoComics, a website featuring comic strips currently syndicated by Andrews McMeel, as well as discontinued titles such as Calvin and Hobbes, The Boondocks, and Bloom County; webcomics such as Pibgorn and Kliban; plus a selection of syndicated comic strips from Creators Syndicate and Tribune Content Agency. King Features syndicates 150 comic strips, newspaper columns, editorial cartoons, puzzles and games to nearly 5,000 newspapers worldwide. Creators syndicates close to 60 strips and 20 editorial cartoonists.  Strip submissions  In Syd Hoff's The Art of Cartooning, King Features Syndicate comics editor Sylvan Byck, who served in that position for more than 25 years, observed that King Features received more than a thousand strip proposals annually, but chose only one each year. Byck offered some tips regarding strip submissions, including the creation of central characters with warmth and charm and the avoidance of \\"themes that are too confining,\\" as he explained: Of the strips that successfully reach syndication, only about one-quarter survive longer than a year or two.Ted Rall quoted in MacDonald, Heidi. \\"Universal Uclick to syndicate United's comic strips,\\" The Beat (February 24, 2011).  Contracts and creator ownership  Historically, syndicates owned the creators' work ‚Äî the name, characters, and likenesses ‚Äî enabling them to continue publishing the strip after the original creator retired, left the strip, or died. An early example of this practice was Rudolph Dirks' hugely successful comic strip, The Katzenjammer Kids, which first appeared in print in 1897. In 1912, Dirks challenged publisher William Randolph Hearst for ownership rights to his comic strip, and ultimately Hearst prevailed.Dirks profile, Lambiek's Comiclopedia. Accessed Jan. 3, 2018. This practice led to \\"legacy strips\\" (or more pejoratively \\"zombie strips\\") ‚Äî strips taken over by other creators ‚Äî which are often criticized as lacking the \\"spark\\" that originally made the strip successful. Most syndicates signed creators to ten- or even twenty-year contracts. (There have been exceptions, however, such as Bud Fisher's Mutt and Jeff being an early ‚Äî if not the earliest ‚Äî case in which the creator retained ownership of his work from the outset.) Milton Caniff was another of several important cartoonists who had tried unsuccessfully to secure rights to their creations. In 1946, he walked away from the enormously popular Terry and the Pirates comic strip because his syndicate insisted that they own his creation. In 1947 Caniff created Steve Canyon because Marshall Field III, who owned Field Newspaper Syndicate, allowed him to own the rights to his comic strip.Holtz, Allan. \\"Obscurity of the Day: Hit or Miss\\", April 13, 2010. Also in 1947, according to publisher Denis Kitchen, Al Capp, creator of the hugely popular Li'l Abner, \\"sued United Feature Syndicate for $14 million, publicly embarrassed UFS in Li'l Abner, and wrested ownership and control of his creation the following year.\\"  Changing syndicates  Most strips stay with the same syndicate over the course of their run (not counting instances where syndicates merge with each other, are acquired, or change names). Over the years, however, for various reasons, a few notable strips changed syndicates. AP Newsfeatures closed down in 1961 and McNaught Syndicate closed down in 1989, prompting a number of strips to end their runs or move to other syndicates. Sometimes ‚Äî as in the case of strips like The World's Greatest Superheroes or Poor Arnold's Almanac ‚Äî a strip took a long hiatus and when it returned to syndication it was with a new company. A watershed moment came in early 1987, when Creators Syndicate was born in response to King Features' acquisition of News America Syndicate and the resulting consolidation of strip syndication. After Creators was founded, Milton Caniff sent Creators founder Richard S. Newcombe a postcard saying, \\"To put it on the record: Hooray!!!\\" Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Mike Peters told Editor & Publisher magazine, \\"It's long overdue that syndicates realize a new day is here. Indentured servitude went out in the 1500s.\\" Johnny Hart, creator of B.C. and The Wizard of Id, called Creators ‚Äúa history-making venture in syndication.‚Äù Bil Keane, creator of The Family Circus, described Creators Syndicate as ‚Äúthe first breath of fresh air the syndicates have had in 100 years of existence.‚Äù A number of prominent strips moved from King Features (and News America) to the independent company Creators.

The first syndicate to distribute comic strips was the McClure Newspaper Syndicate (founded in 1884), which began syndicating comic strips circa 1901. (McClure's more notable strips included Billy Bounce, by W. W. Denslow and later by C. W. Kahles, (1901‚Äì1906);Billy Bounce at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on June 11, 2015. Superman, which it syndicated beginning in 1939; and Batman and Robin, debuting in 1943.) Beginning about 1905, Joseph Pulitzer's New York World began syndicating strips to other newspapers under the name World Feature Service; in circa 1910 it added the syndication division New York World Press Publishing (also known as Press Publishing Co.).Hudson, Frederic, Alfred McClung Lee, and Frank Luther Mott. American Journalism 1690-1940, Volume 4 (Psychology Press, 2000), p. 591. The Newspaper Enterprise Association, (NEA), founded by E. W. Scripps in 1902, began syndicating comic strips by 1909. The Associated Newspapers syndicate was launched in 1912, a cooperative of four newspapers: The New York Globe, the Chicago Daily News, The Boston Globe, and the Philadelphia Bulletin, run by S. S. McClure's cousin H. H. McClure. John Neville Wheeler's Wheeler Syndicate debuted in 1913, contracting with pioneering comic strip artist Bud Fisher and cartoonist Fontaine Fox to begin distributing their work. Fisher is reported to have received an annual guarantee of $52,000, an unprecedented amount at that time. The Wheeler Syndicate was purchased by the McClure Syndicate in 1916; Wheeler immediately founded another, the Bell Syndicate, and re-acquired cartoonists Fisher and Fox. In 1914, William Randolph Hearst founded King Features, the oldest comics syndicate still in operation. Popular, long-running King strips launched during this period included The Katzenjammer Kids (1897-2006) and Thimble Theatre/Popeye (1919‚Äìpresent). Also launched c. 1914 was the New York Herald Syndicate, known for most of its operation as the New York Herald Tribune Syndicate.\\"Briggs Succumbs: Clare Briggs, Cartoon Genius, Dies at 54,\\" Editor & Publisher (Jan. 11, 1930). Archived at \\"News of Yore 1930,\\" Stripper's Guide. Accessed Dec. 1, 2017. The Syndicate's first comic strip of note was Clare Briggs' Mr. and Mrs., which debuted in 1919. The Public Ledger Syndicate was launched in 1915 by Philadelphia Public Ledger publisher Cyrus H. K. Curtis. The Ledger Syndicates' most notable strips during its 30 years in operation were A. E. Hayward's Somebody's Stenog; Hairbreadth Harry (by C. W. Kahles and later by F. O. Alexander); Frank Godwin's Connie and Babe Bunting; Joe Bowers' Dizzy Dramas; Clare Victor Dwiggins (\\"Dwig\\")'s Footprints on the Sands of Time and Nipper; and Roy Powers, Eagle Scout (\\"the official strip of the Boy Scouts of America\\"). The George Matthew Adams Service debuted in 1916, which syndicated such strips as Billy DeBeck's Finn an' Haddie, Robert Baldwin's Freddy, Edwina Dumm's Cap Stubbs and Tippie and Ed Wheelan's Minute Movies. Adams' syndicate peaked in the 1920s and 1930s. Cartoonist Sidney Smith's popular strip The Gumps, which debuted in the Chicago Tribune in 1917, played a key role in the rise of syndication. Joseph Medill Patterson founded the Chicago Tribune Syndicate in 1918, managed by Arthur Crawford.Watson, Elmo Scott. \\"The Era of Consolidation, 1890-1920\\" (Chapter VII), in A History Of Newspaper Syndicates In The United States, 1865-1935 (Western Newspaper Union, 1936), archived at Stripper's Guide In 1919, Patterson and Robert R. McCormick, who had been co-publishing the Chicago Tribune since 1914, planned to launch a tabloid in New York. As comics historian Coulton Waugh explained: Now known as Tribune Content Agency, the syndicate continues to provide content to newspapers.  Continued growth (1920s‚Äì1930s)  Notable strips launched by the New York Herald Tribune Syndicate in the 1920s included Harrison Cady's Peter Rabbit, Charles A. Voight's Betty (which had originated with the McClure Syndicate),Markstein, Don. \\"Betty,\\" Toonopedia. Accessed Dec. 6, 2017. Crawford Young's Clarence,Crawford Young bio, Lambiek's Comiclopedia. Accessed Dec. 23, 2017. and H. T. Webster's The Timid Soul (later known as Caspar Milquetoast). All of those strips had long syndication runs of at least 25 years. The McNaught Syndicate was founded in 1922, with one of its first notable syndicated strips being those of Rube Goldberg. McNaught's line-up of comic strips included Dixie Dugan and Mickey Finn. Ham Fisher's Joe Palooka was one of the McNaught Syndicate's big successes. The Des Moines Register launched the long-running Register and Tribune Syndicate in 1922 as well; their most notable cartoons and comic strips included The Family Circus (debuting in 1960), which was eventually distributed to more than 1,000 newspapers. They also syndicated The Amazing Spider-Man, which debuted in 1977 and is still running. In 1925, Chicago-area businessmen Harold H.

The Associated Press launched their syndicate (later known as AP Newsfeatures) in 1930 with nine comic strips, including John Terry's Scorchy Smith. They added Sunday strips a decade later, in 1940. In 1930, the North American Newspaper Alliance absorbed the Bell Syndicate, both continuing to operate individually under joint ownership as the Bell Syndicate-North American Newspaper Alliance. That same year, Bell acquired Associated Newspapers. Keeping Associated Newspapers as a division, at that point the company became the Bell-McClure Syndicate.Saunders, David. \\"SAMUEL S. McCLURE (1857-1949),\\" Field Guide to Wild American Pulp Artists. Accessed Nov. 1, 2018.

Seattle, Wash.: Fantagraphics Books, 2011. Later that year, the Chicago Tribune Syndicate changed its name to the Tribune-New York (Daily) News Syndicate (eventually becoming Tribune Content Agency). In 1933, just as the concept of \\"comic books\\" was getting off the ground, Eastern Color Printing published Funnies on Parade, which reprinted in color several comic strips licensed from the Ledger Syndicate, the McNaught Syndicate, and the Bell-McClure Syndicate.\\"Funnies on Parade,\\" Grand Comics Database. Accessed Oct. 29, 2018. Eastern Color neither sold this periodical nor made it available on newsstands, but rather sent it out free as a promotional item to consumers who mailed in coupons clipped from Procter & Gamble soap and toiletries products. The company printed 10,000 copies, and it was a great success.Brown, Mitchell. Eventually, Gaines and Eastern collaborated in 1934 to publish the ongoing title Famous Funnies, which ran for 218 issues using a mixture of newspaper strip reprints and some original material, and is considered the first true American comic book.Goulart, Ron. \\"The Funnies: I\\" (entry), Comic Book Encyclopedia (Harper Entertainment, New York, 2004) , p. 144 Also in 1933, Editors Press Service launched; though never a large operation, EPS is notable for being the first U.S. company to actively syndicate material internationally.  The boom years (1940s‚Äì1950s)  Marshall Field III launched the Chicago Sun Syndicate (later known as the Field Newspaper Syndicate) in 1941, whose most popular offering was the comic strip Steve Canyon. In the 1940s, the Register and Tribune Syndicate's The Spirit (by Will Eisner) was part of a 16-page Sunday supplement known colloquially as \\"The Spirit Section\\". This was a tabloid-sized newsprint comic book sold as part of eventually 20 Sunday newspapers with a combined circulation of as many as five million copies. During the final months of World War II, Robert M. Hall (who had worked at United Feature Syndicate in the 1930s) began his own syndicate. Soon Hall developed his own features, including a variety of comic strips: Debbie Dean, Mark Trail and Bruce Gentry, along with Herblock's editorial cartoons. Beginning in April 1959, Feiffer was distributed nationally by the Hall Syndicate. The Times Mirror Company launched Mirror Enterprises Syndicate in the late 1940s; it eventually became known as the Los Angeles Times Syndicate and was known for syndicating the Star Wars newspaper strip from 1979‚Äì1984. In September 1952, the Bell-McClure Syndicate acquired the historic McClure Newspaper Syndicate, with Louis Ruppel installed as president and editor.Knoll, Erwin. \\"McClure Syndicate Sold to Bell-NANA\\". Editor & Publisher (September 6, 1952).  Consolidation and changing times (1960s and 1970s)  In 1963, Chicago-based Field Enterprises and New York Herald Tribune publisher John Hay Whitney acquired Publishers Syndicate,Stetson, Damon. \\"Herald Tribune Is Closing Its News Service: But Meyer Says Columns That Appeared in Paper Will Be in Merged Publication,\\" The New York Times (June 24, 1966). merging Publishers' existing syndication operations with the New York Herald Tribune Syndicate, Field's Chicago Sun- Times Syndicate, and the syndicate of the Chicago Daily NewsToni Mendez Collection (a newspaper that had been acquired by Field Enterprises in 1959). When the New York Herald Tribune folded in 1966, Publishers inherited their strips, including B.C., Miss Peach, and Penny. The George Matthew Adams Service petered out in the mid-1960s after the death of Adams in 1962; in 1966 the Adams Service's remaining assets and features were acquired by The Washington Star to form the Washington Star SyndicateBoyd, Crosby N., President. \\"THE WASHINGTON STAR HAS PURCHASED THE GEORGE MATTHEW ADAMS SERVICE, A NEWSPAPER FEATURE SYNDICATE,\\" The Washington Star (May 9, 1965). Archived at CIA.gov. (which never had much traction in the comic strip market). In 1967, Field Enterprises acquired the Hall Syndicate, merging it with the previously acquired Publishers Syndicate to form the Publishers-Hall Syndicate. By the mid-1960s competition from television and other media began to dilute the central place of comic strips in American lives. As comics historian Maurice Horn writes, \\"the 1960s were the decade during which the comics syndicates were most blatantly aping successful television shows in a desperate (and vain) attempt at regaining their fast-disappearing readership.\\" In 1968, an Editor & Publisher survey of a selection of syndicates revealed the following details about the syndicates, the number of features offered, and the number of client papers: * Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate (150 features; 1400 newspapers) * Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA) (75 features; 750 newspapers) * United Feature Syndicate (50 features; 1500 newspapers) * Columbia Features (45 features; 1000 newspapers) * National Newspaper Syndicate (35 features; 650 newspapers)Maley, Don. \\"Super Roads to Riches are Paved with Comics,\\" Editor & Publisher (Nov. 30, 1968).

John McMeel was assistant general manager and national sales director for the Publishers-Hall Syndicate when he began Universal Press Syndicate in 1970. When Gary Trudeau's Doonesbury debuted as a daily strip in two dozen newspapers on October 26, 1970, it was the first strip from Universal Press Syndicate, and a Sunday strip was launched March 21, 1971. Circulation of Doonesbury eventually expanded to more than 1,400 newspapers internationally.\\"Doonesbury: Drawing and Quartering for Fun and Profit\\". Time, February 9, 1976. At first, ownership of the strips was in the hands of both the artist and the syndicate. The McNaught Syndicate's last success came with the comic strip Heathcliff, which they syndicated from the start in 1973 until the late 1980s. Heathcliff appeared in some 1,000 newspapers, and the McNaught Syndicate became the production company for a few Heathcliff movies, including Heathcliff: The Movie from 1986. In 1972, United Features Syndicate acquired the combined operations of the North American Newspaper Alliance and the Bell-McClure Syndicate and absorbed them into United Features' operations.Astor, Dave. \\"Goldberg To Retire From United Media,\\" Editor & Publisher (December 17, 2001): \\"The executive joined United in 1972 when it bought Bell McClure Syndicate and North American Newspaper Alliance, where Goldberg was president.\\" In 1975, Field Enterprises absorbed Publishers-Hall into its Field Newspaper Syndicate, consolidating control of such popular, long-running strips as Mary Worth, Steve Roper, Penny, Kerry Drake, Rex Morgan, M.D., Judge Parker, Miss Peach, B.C., The Wizard of Id, Dennis the Menace, Funky Winkerbean, Mark Trail, and Momma. In February 1978, the Washington Star Syndicate was sold (along with its parent company) to Time Inc.Lynton, Stephen J. \\"Washington Star Sold To Time for $20 Million,\\" The Washington Post (February 4, 1978). A little more than a year later, the Universal Press Syndicate acquired the Star Syndicate from the remaining assets of the Washington Star Company.\\"Washington Star Syndicate Sold To Kansas City's Universal Press,\\" The New York Times (May 20, 1979), p. 37. In May 1978 Scripps merged United Feature Syndicate and the Newspaper Enterprise Association to form United Media Enterprises. Although the Washington Post Writers Group was formed in 1973, it didn't begin syndicating comic strips until 1980 with Berkeley Breathed's popular strip Bloom County.  Further consolidation and upheaval (1980s‚Äì1990s)  The 1980s was a period of consolidation and upheaval in the syndicated comics strip business. In 1983, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation purchased the Field Newspaper Syndicate,Friendly, Jonathan. \\"Murdoch Buys Chicago Sun-Times,\\" The New York Times, 2 November 1983, page D1. renaming it News America Syndicate (NAS) in 1984. In 1986, the Register and Tribune Syndicate was sold to Hearst and King Features for $4.3 million.Strentz, Herb. \\"John Cowles,\\" Cowles Family Publishing Legacy: Drake University, Cowles Library. Accessed Jan. 3, 2018. Late in that year, the Chicago Tribune estimated that the country's top three comic strip syndicates were Hearst's King Features, Scripps' United Media, and News Corp's NAS. In late December of that same year, Hearst bought NAS (which the company renamed North America Syndicate).King Features Syndicate profile. via Hearst Corporation The pending sale of NAS (which was first reported in October 1986), prompted NAS president Richard S. Newcombe to leave the company in January 1987 and, using financial backing from London-based publisher Robert Maxwell, form Creators Syndicate before the close of the NAS sale. Creators Syndicate originated on February 13, 1987. Within a month, Creators Syndicate acquired the syndication rights to the worldwide comic strip B.C., and a few months after that acquired the syndication rights to the cartoon works of Herblock. Creators became one of the few successful independent syndicates founded since the 1930s; it was also the first syndicate to allow cartoonists ownership rights to their work. By this point (mid-1987), the top syndicates, by number of features, ranked as follows: # King Features Syndicate (Hearst Corporation) 194 # North America Syndicate (Hearst Corporation) 122 # Tribune Media Services (Tribune Company) 120 # United Feature Syndicate (United Media) 85 # Los Angeles Times Syndicate (Times Mirror Company) 85 # Newspaper Enterprise Association (United Media) 76 # Universal Press Syndicate 74 # New York Times Syndication Sales (New York Times Company) 51 # The Washington Post Writers Group (The Washington Post Company) 37 # McNaught Syndicate (independent) 24 Hearst (King Features and NAS) led the way with 316 features, United Media (United Feature Syndicate and NEA) ranked second with 161, and the Tribune Company (Tribune Media Services) was third with 120 features. The McNaught Syndicate eventually folded in September 1989. Beginning in 1990, following the lead of Creators, Universal Press Syndicate gave strip creators full rights to their respective works. The company also instituted a policy that any cartoonist who was with them for five years or more received four weeks a year of vacation. In 1996, Universal Press Syndicate formed Universal New Media, later known as Uclick, to distribute \\"digital entertainment content.\\" A Washington Post article in 1997 gave the number of syndicates which distributed comic strips as nine, specifically mentioning United Media, Creators Syndicate, Universal Press Syndicate, The Washington Post Writers Group, and Chronicle Features.Parker, Lonnae O'Neal. \\"STRIP TEASE,\\" The Washington Post (August 20, 1997).

Further consolidation (2000s)  Upon the acquisition of Times Mirror Company in 2000, the Los Angeles Times Syndicate was merged into Tribune Media Services, which still operates today under the name Tribune Content Agency, and syndicates close to 20 comic strips.

Bulgarians make up a significant minority of Odessa Oblast, especially the city of Bolhrad.  Location and number  In Ukraine, the number of Bulgarians is estimated at over 140,000 (the 2001 Ukrainian Census counted a total of 204,600 Bulgarians which includes an undetermined number of more recent emigrants). Bulgarians comprise the majority in Bolhrad District and are prevalent in the district of Budjak in the Odessa Oblast and throughout the southern part of the country. Many Bulgarians have moved to Odessa, the regional capital in recent years. The Ukrainian Oblasts with the highest number of Bulgarians are: * Odessa: 150,700 (6.1%) * Zaporizhzhia: 27,800 (1.4%) * Mykolaiv: 5,600 (0.4%) * Donetsk: 4,800 (0.1%) Percentage around Odessa Oblast (2001 census, yellow for Bulgarians)  History  The modern population of Bulgarians settled in the region at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, at the time of feudal sedition in the Ottoman Empire and after the Russo-Turkish Wars. Particularly significant waves of emigration began after the Russo-Turkish Wars of 1806‚Äì1812 and 1828‚Äì1829. The settlers came primarily from what is now eastern Bulgaria, but many were also descendants of Bulgarians of the western part of the country that had moved east in and before the 18th century. Among the Bulgarians that emigrated were also a handful of Albanians who also had settled in eastern Bulgaria some time ago. After arriving, the Bulgarians founded their own towns, such as Bolhrad (1819) and Comrat, and around 64 villages. In 1856, after the Treaty of Paris, the region of Bessarabia was divided with the southwestern parts, including Bolhrad, Izmail and Kilia, incorporated into Moldova (since 1861 ‚Äì Kingdom of Romania), and the northeastern ones, centered on Comrat, remaining in the Russian Empire. A Bulgarian gymnasium (school) was founded in Bolhrad on 28 June 1858, which had a significant effect on the development of Bulgarian education and culture and was the first modern Bulgarian gymnasium. In 1861, 20,000 Bulgarians from the Romanian part of Bessarabia moved to Russia, where they were given land in Taurida Governorate to replace the Nogais who had left what was formerly territory of the Crimean Khanate. Those settlers founded another Bulgarian community‚Äîthe Tauridan Bulgarians. After the whole region was incorporated once again into the Russian Empire in 1878, the process of Russification grew stronger, as many Bulgarian intellectuals returned to the newly established Principality of Bulgaria to help set up the Bulgarian state. The Russian Empire deprived the Bulgarian minority of the rights earned during Romanian control. The whole of Bessarabia was ceded to Romania in 1918 after the Russian Revolution and the collapse of the Russian Empire. In contrast with the previous period of Romanian control, most cultural and educational rights of the Bulgarian minority were taken away which led to cases of armed resistance such as the Tatarbunary Uprising of 1924. The Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact of 1939 led to the June 1940 Soviet ultimatum, the invasion and annexation of Bessarabia by the Soviet Union. Although an officially accepted minority under Soviet rule, the local Bulgarians lost some features of their cultural identity. A movement of national revival began in the 1980s, with the publication of Bulgarian newspapers, establishment of cultural and educational associations, and the introduction of Bulgarian into the local schools, accelerating after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and primarily offered as an elective, but later as a compulsory subject.

The name of the sport is derived from a portmanteau of the words Paralympic and athletics ‚Äì the former term itself is a portmanteau of the words paraplegic and Olympic, though it now describes athletics for all disabilities. Some para-athletics competitors (in particular deaf, visually impaired, and amputee athletes) also compete in the able-bodied division of the sport, though competitions with a mix of elite disabled and able-bodied athletes are not typically classed as para-athletics. Classification Timoth√©e Adolphe and his sighted guide C√©dric Felip Competitors at elite level competitions are classified by disability, to arrange athletes with a similar disability in the same event.

It is part of St. Olavs Hospital Trust that operates all the hospitals in S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag and thus indirectly state owned. It cooperates closely with the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in research and in education of medical doctors. The university is named for Olaf II of Norway, also known as St. Olav. It performed 274,441 somatic and 88,692 psychiatric consultations in 2005 with 8,691 employees and a budget of Norwegian krone 5.1 billion. Trondheim Heliport, St. Olav's Hospital is a helipad located adjacent to the emergency ward. It opened on 1 February 2010 and has a fuel tank. History The hospital was created in 1902 when the New Trondheim Hospital was built at √òya and on June 18 the first patient was accepted. S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag county municipality increased its ownership from one third to half in 1948 and in 1950 it changed its name to Trondheim Central Hospital. In 1959 the first part of the central section with six stories is built, expanded in 1974 to ten. In 1964 the county took over the responsibility for the hospital and renamed to Trondheim Regional Hospital two years later. The clinical education starts in 1975 in cooperation with the University of Bergen, with 43 doctors graduating in 1980. Through the late 1990s and early 2000s a major debate about the location was initiated, with a suggestion to move the entire hospital to Dragvoll on the outskirts of the city. The background was the need for en entirely new hospital, and on May 28, 2002 Storting decided to build an entirely new hospital at √òya. The same year the Government, through Central Norway Regional Health Authority had taken over the responsibility for the hospital. The first new buildings were opened in 2005.

Some of its constituents likely represent red algae, whereas others resemble lichens.  History of research  Nematothallus was first described by Lang in 1937, who envisioned it being an early thallose land plant with tubular features and sporophytes, covered by a cuticle which preserved impressions of the underlying cells. He had found abundant disaggregated remains of all three features, none of which were connected to another, leaving his reconstruction of the phytodebris as parts of a single organism highly conjectural. Even so, it was picked up by Jonker (1973), who proposed that Nematothallus represented leaves of Prototaxites, which he interpreted as a red alga. Further work failed to draw together all aspects of the organism: Edwards (1982) and Edwards and Rose (1984) both provided thorough descriptions of the cuticular aspects of the plants, while Pratt et al. (1978) and Niklas and Smocovitis (1983) focused on the anatomy of the tubes. Indeed, some workers suggested that the name Nematothallus should only apply to the tubes, until Strother (1993) found more complete specimens, with tubes attached to the cuticle. He attempted to unite and formalise the genus, and extended it to include banded tubes, which are instead referred to as nematoclasts (Graham & Gray 2001). It is possible that Nematothallus consisted of two layers of cuticle, although fossils giving this impression may in fact represent two layers which happened to overlap one another and become stuck. It is not readily established what the cuticle represents. Lang (1945) had it as an epidermal layer, similar to the waxy cuticle of plants today, covering a parenchymatous layer. Alternatively, Edwards (1982) proposed that the inner tissue of Nematothallus comprised stringy tubes, with the cellular patterning produced by their ends. The genus was later formalised by Strother, who discovered better preserved and more complete specimens in Pennsylvania, America ‚Äì which appear to show tubes connected to the rims of cuticle. Nematothallus is widespread from the late Silurian, but similar cuticle is reported from the Caradoc epoch (late Ordovician, ). It is, however, difficult to distinguish Nematothallus cuticle from that of arthropods. Further work by Edwards and Rose has identified oval- shaped growths in places on the cuticles of a limited number of Nematothallus fragments, which develop into holes ‚Äì whose purpose is unknown. Since they are not found in all Nematothallus individuals, it is unlikely that they were involved in gas exchange ‚Äì perhaps they were involved in the release of spores? One fossil gives the impression, which may well be an illusion, of spores being trapped between two layers of cuticle.  Habitat  Nematothallus was originally recovered from the Red Downtonian near the base of the Old Red Sandstone, between the clearly marine Ludlow deposits beneath it, and the unambiguously terrestrial Lower Old Red Sandstone. Further samples came from elsewhere in the Lower Old Red Sandstone (St Maughams Group, lowermost Devonian), where they co-occur with plant spores. Additional, older material occurs with Hostinella, Cooksonia and Steganotheca in the Ludlow (upper Ludfordian) Whitcliffe formation.  Affinity  Apertures in Nematothallopsis fringed with filaments and sporting further development A Nematothallopsis aperture fringed with multi-cellular filaments Spores surrounding an aperture in Nematothallopsis Some material assigned to Nematothallus closely resembles certain lichens, suggesting a lichenous habit ‚Äì although as the lichens evolved at least six times independently, this does not fully establish the genetic affinity. The biochemistry of the organism is not inconsistent with an algal affinity, but Edwards (1982) considers it unlikely that algae would be preserved as coalified impressions. However, Edwards does note that the surface patterning could have been produced in a similar fashion to surface layers in green algae ‚Äì that is, by the ends of tightly packed filaments causing indentation on the surface layer. (Just because they were formed in the same way doesn't mean they were formed by green algae, though.) The most likely affinity, for the aperture-bearing cuticles, is with the coralline red algae; the absence of biomineralization suggests a stem-group level affiliation. Whereas Smith & Butterfield contend that this material is separate from the charcoalified lichen-like material, Edwards insists that all the material comes from the same lichen-like organism.  Synonyms  N. taenia and N. lobata were both collapsed into a new form-species Laevitubulus laxus.

The archbishop and the king were involved in the Investiture Crisis, where the church objected to the secular powers giving the symbols of ecclesiastical office to clerics.

It is an important topic in modern mathematical theory and computer science, particularly associated with the work of Alonzo Church and Alan Turing. The debate and discovery of the meaning of \\"computation\\" and \\"recursion\\" has been long and contentious. This article provides detail of that debate and discovery from Peano's axioms in 1889 through recent discussion of the meaning of \\"axiom\\". Peano's nine axioms of arithmetic In 1889, Giuseppe Peano presented his The principles of arithmetic, presented by a new method, based on the work of Dedekind. Soare proposes that the origination of \\"primitive recursion\\" began formally with the axioms of Peano, although :\\"Well before the nineteenth century mathematicians used the principle of defining a function by induction. Dedekind 1888 proved, using accepted axioms, that such a definition defines a unique function, and he applied it to the definition of the functions m+n, m x n, and mn. Based on this work of Dedekind, Peano 1889 and 1891 wrote the familiar five [sic] axioms for the positive integers. As a companion to his fifth [sic] axiom, mathematical induction, Peano used definition by induction, which has been called primitive recursion (since P√©ter 1934 and Kleene 1936) ... .\\"Soare 1996:5 Observe that in fact Peano's axioms are 9 in number and axiom 9 is the recursion/induction axiom.cf: van Heijenoort 1976:94 :\\"Subsequently the 9 were reduced to 5 as \\"Axioms 2, 3, 4 and 5 which deal with identity, belong to the underlying logic. This leaves the five axioms that have become universally known as \\"the Peano axioms ... Peano acknowledges (1891b, p. 93) that his axioms come from Dedekind ... .\\"van Heijenoort 1976:83 Hilbert and the Entscheidungsproblem At the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in 1900 in Paris the famous mathematician David Hilbert posed a set of problems ‚Äì now known as Hilbert's problems ‚Äì his beacon illuminating the way for mathematicians of the twentieth century. Hilbert's 2nd and 10th problems introduced the Entscheidungsproblem (the \\"decision problem\\"). In his 2nd problem he asked for a proof that \\"arithmetic\\" is \\"consistent\\". Kurt G√∂del would prove in 1931 that, within what he called \\"P\\" (nowadays called Peano Arithmetic), \\"there exist undecidable sentences [propositions]\\".G√∂del 1931a in (Davis 1965:6), 1930 in (van Heijenoort 1967:596) Because of this, \\"the consistency of P is unprovable in P, provided P is consistent\\".G√∂del‚Äôs theorem IX, G√∂del 1931a in (Davis 1965:36) While G√∂del‚Äôs proof would display the tools necessary for Alonzo Church and Alan Turing to resolve the Entscheidungsproblem, he himself would not answer it. It is within Hilbert's 10th problem where the question of an \\"Entscheidungsproblem\\" actually appears. The heart of matter was the following question: \\"What do we mean when we say that a function is 'effectively calculable'\\"? The answer would be something to this effect: \\"When the function is calculated by a mechanical procedure (process, method).\\" Although stated easily nowadays, the question (and answer) would float about for almost 30 years before it was framed precisely. Hilbert's original description of problem 10 begins as follows: :\\"10. Determination of the solvability of a Diophantine equation. Given a Diophantine equation with any number of unknown quantities and with rational integral coefficients: To devise a process according to which it can be determined in a finite number of operations whether the equation is solvable in rational integers.This translation, and the original text in German, appears in (Dershowitz and Gurevich 2007:1-2)\\" By 1922, the specific question of an \\"Entscheidungsproblem\\" applied to Diophantine equations had developed into the more general question about a \\"decision method\\" for any mathematical formula. Martin Davis explains it this way: Suppose we are given a \\"calculational procedure\\" that consists of (1) a set of axioms and (2) a logical conclusion written in first-order logic, that is‚Äîwritten in what Davis calls \\"Frege's rules of deduction\\" (or the modern equivalent of Boolean logic). G√∂del‚Äôs doctoral dissertationG√∂del 1930 in (van Heijenoort 1967:592ff) proved that Frege's rules were complete \\"... in the sense that every valid formula is provable\\".van Heijenoort 1967:582 Given that encouraging fact, could there be a generalized \\"calculational procedure\\" that would tell us whether a conclusion can be derived from its premises? Davis calls such calculational procedures \\"algorithms\\". The Entscheidungsproblem would be an algorithm as well. \\"In principle, an algorithm for [the] Entscheidungsproblem would have reduced all human deductive reasoning to brute calculation\\".Davis 2000:146 In other words: Is there an \\"algorithm\\" that can tell us if any formula is \\"true\\" (i.e. an algorithm that always correctly yields a judgment \\"truth\\" or \\"falsehood\\"?) :\\" ... it seemed clear to Hilbert that with the solution of this problem, the Entscheidungsproblem, that it should be possible in principle to settle all mathematical questions in a purely mechanical manner. Hence, given unsolvable problems at all, if Hilbert was correct, then the Entscheidungsproblem itself should be unsolvable\\".Davis 1965:108 Indeed: What about our Entscheidungsproblem algorithm itself? Can it determine, in a finite number of steps, whether it, itself, is ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù and \\"truthful\\" (that is, it does not get hung up in an endless \\"circle\\" or \\"loop\\", and it correctly yields a judgment \\"truth\\" or \\"falsehood\\" about its own behavior and results)? Three problems from Hilbert's 2nd and 10th problems At the 1928 Congress [in Bologna, Italy] Hilbert refines the question very carefully into three parts. The following is Stephen Hawking's summary: *\\"1. To prove that all true mathematical statements could be proven, that is, the completeness of mathematics. *\\"2. To prove that only true mathematical statements could be proven, that is, the consistency of mathematics, *\\"3. To prove the decidability of mathematics, that is, the existence of a decision procedure to decide the truth or falsity of any given mathematical proposition.\\" Hawking 2005:1121 Simple arithmetic functions irreducible to primitive recursion Gabriel Sudan (1927) and Wilhelm Ackermann (1928) display recursive functions that are not primitive recursive: :\\"Are there recursions that are not reducible to primitive recursion; and in particular can recursion be used to define a function which is not primitive recursive? :\\"This question arose from a conjecture of Hilbert in 1926 on the continuum problem, and was answered [yes: there are recursions that are not primitive recursive] by Ackermann 1928.\\"Kleene 1952:271 In subsequent years Kleenecf. Kleene 1952:272-273 observes that R√≥zsa P√©ter (1935) simplified Ackermann's example (\\"cf. also Hilbert-Bernays 1934\\") and Raphael Robinson (1948). P√©ter exhibited another example (1935) that employed Cantor's diagonal argument. P√©ter (1950) and Ackermann (1940) also displayed \\"transfinite recursions\\", and this led Kleene to wonder: :\\"... whether we can characterize in any exact way the notion of any \\"recursion\\", or the class of all \\"recursive functions.\\"Kleene 1952:273 Kleene concludescf. Kleene 1952:274 that all \\"recursions\\" involve (i) the formal analysis he presents in his ¬ß54 Formal calculations of primitive recursive functions and, (ii) the use of mathematical induction. He immediately goes on to state that indeed the G√∂del-Herbrand definition does indeed \\"characterize all recursive functions\\" ‚Äì see the quote in 1934, below. G√∂del's proof In 1930, mathematicians gathered for a mathematics meeting and retirement event for Hilbert. As luck would have it, :\\"at the very same meeting, a young Czech mathematician, Kurt G√∂del, announced results which dealt it [Hilbert's opinion that all three answers were YES] a serious blow.\\"Hodges 1983:92 He announced that the answer to the first two of Hilbert's three questions of 1928 was NO. Subsequently in 1931 G√∂del published his famous paper On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related In his preface to this paper Martin Davis delivers a caution: :\\"The reader should be warned that [in this particular paper] what G√∂del calls recursive functions are now called primitive recursive functions. (The revised terminology was introduced by KleeneKleene 1936 in (Davis 1965:237ff)).\\"Davis 1965:4 G√∂del expansion of \\"effective calculation\\" To quote Kleene (1952), \\"The characterization of all \\"recursive functions\\" was accomplished in the definition of 'general recursive function' by G√∂del 1934, who built on a suggestion of Herbrand\\" (Kleene 1952:274). G√∂del delivered a series of lectures at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS), Princeton NJ. In a preface written by Martin DavisDavis 1965:39‚Äì40 Davis observes that :\\"Dr. G√∂del has stated in a letter that he was, at the time of these lectures, not at all convinced that his concept of recursion comprised all possible recursions ...\\"Davis 1965:40 Dawson states that these lectures were meant to clarify concerns that the \\"incompleteness theorems were somehow dependent on the particularities of formalization\\":(Dawson 1997:101) :\\"G√∂del mentioned Ackermann's example in the final section of his 1934 paper, as a way of motivating the concept of \\"general recursive function\\" that he defined there; but earlier in footnote 3, he had already conjectured (as \\"a heuristic principle\\") that all finitarily computable functions could be obtained through recursions of such more general sorts. :\\"The conjecture has since elicited much comment. In particular, when Martin Davis undertook to publish G√∂del's 1934 lectures [in Davis 1965:41ff] he took it to be a variant of Church's Thesis; but in a letter to Davis ...[246: \\"KG to Martin Davis, 15 February 1965, Quoted in G√∂del 1986‚Äì, vol. I, p. 341\\"] G√∂del stated emphatically that that was \\"not true\\" because at the time of those lectures he was \\"not at all convinced\\" that his concept of recursion comprised \\"all possible recursions.\\" Rather, he said, \\"The conjecture stated there only refers to the equivalence of 'finite (computation) procedure' and 'recursive procedure.'\\" To clarify the issue G√∂del added a postscript to the lectures,G√∂del 1964 in (Davis 1965:247) also reprinted in (G√∂del 1986, vol. I:369‚Äì371) in which he indicated that what had finally convinced him that the intuitively computable functions coincided with those that were general recursive was Alan Turing's work . :\\"G√∂del's reluctance to regard either general recursiveness or Œª-definability as adequate characterization of the informal notion of effective computability has been examined in detail by several authors [Footnote 248: \\"See especially Davis 1982; Gandy 1980 and 1988; Sieg 1994\\"]. There is a consensus that, in fact, neither G√∂del's nor Church's formalisms were so perspicuous or intrinsically persuasive as Alan Turing's analysis, and Wilfried Sieg has argued that the evidence in favor of Church's Thesis provided by the \\"confluence of different notions\\" (the fact that the systems proposed by Church, G√∂del, Post and Alan Turing all turned out to have the same extension) is less compelling than has generally supposed. Hence, quite apart from G√∂del's innate caution there were good reasons for his skepticism. But what, then, was he attempting to achieve through his notion of general recursiveness? ... :\\"Rather, G√∂del obtained his definition [of the class of general recursive functions] through modification of Herbrand's ideas ...; and Wilfried Sieg has argued that his real purpose in the final section of the 1934 paper [the lecture notes] was \\"to disassociate recursive functions from [Herbrand's] epistemologically restricted notion of proof\\" by specifying \\"mechanical rules for deriving equations.\\" What was more general about G√∂del's notion of \\"general\\" recursiveness was, Sieg suggests, that Herbrand had intended only to characterize those functions that could be proved to be recursive by finitary means [250].\\"Italics in the original Dawson 1997:101‚Äì102 Kleene Kleene and Rosser transcribed G√∂del's 1934 lectures in Princeton. In his paper General Recursive Functions of Natural NumbersKleene 1935 in (Davis 1965:236ff) Kleene states: :\\"A definition of general recursive function of natural numbers was suggested by Herbrand to G√∂del, and was used by G√∂del with an important modification in a series of lectures at Princeton in 1934 ...Kleene 1935 in (Davis 1965:237) :\\"A recursive function (relation) in the sense of G√∂del ... will now be called a primitive recursive function (relation).Kleene 1935 in (Davis 1965:239) Church definition of \\"effectively calculable\\" Church's paper An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory (1936) proved that the Entscheidungsproblem was undecidable within the Œª-calculus and G√∂del-Herbrand's general recursion; moreover Church cites two theorems of Kleene's that proved that the functions defined in the Œª-calculus are identical to the functions defined by general recursion: :\\"Theorem XVI. Every recursive function of positive integers is Œª-definable.16 :\\"Theorem XVII. Every Œª-definable function of positive integers is recursive.17 ::\\"16 ... . In the form here it was first obtained by Kleene... . ::\\"17 This result was obtained independently by the present author and S. C. Kleene at about the same time. The paper opens with a very long footnote, 3. Another footnote, 9, is also of interest. Martin Davis states that \\"This paper is principally important for its explicit statement (since known as Church's thesis) that the functions which can be computed by a finite algorithm are precisely the recursive functions, and for the consequence that an explicit unsolvable problem can be given\\":Church 1936 in (Davis 1965:88) :\\"3 As will appear, this definition of effective calculability can be stated in either of two equivalent forms, (1) ... Œª-definable ... 2) ... recursive ... . The notion of Œª-definability is due jointly to the present author and S. C. Kleene, successive steps towards it having been taken by the present author in the Annals of Mathematics, vol. 34 (1933), p. 863, and Kleene in the American Journal of Mathematics, vol. 57 (1935), p. 219. The notion of recursiveness in the sense of ¬ß4 below is due jointly to Jacques Herbrand and Kurt G√∂del, as is there explained. And the proof of equivalence of the two notions is due chiefly to Kleene, but also partly to the present author and to J. B. Rosser ... . The proposal to identify these notions with the intuitive notion of effective calculability is first made in the present paper (but see the first footnote to ¬ß7 below). :\\"With the aid of the methods of Kleene (American Journal of Mathematics, 1935), the considerations of the present paper could, with comparatively slight modification be carried through entirely in terms of Œª-definability, without making use of the notion of recursiveness. On the other hand, since the results of the present paper were obtained, it has been shown by Kleene (see his forthcoming paper, \\"General recursive functions of natural numbers\\") that analogous results can be obtained entirely in terms of recursiveness, without making use of Œª-definability. The fact, however, that two such widely different and (in the opinion of the author) equally natural definitions of effective calculability turn out to be equivalent adds to the strength of the reasons adduced below for believing that they constitute as general a characterization of this notion as is consistent with the usual intuitive understanding of it.\\"Church 1936 in (Davis 1965:90) Footnote 9 is in section ¬ß4 Recursive functions: :\\" 9This definition [of \\"recursive\\"] is closely related to, and was suggested by, a definition of recursive functions which was proposed by Kurt G√∂del, in lectures at Princeton, N. J., 1934, and credited by him in part to an unpublished suggestion of Jacques Herbrand. The principal features in which present definition of recursiveness differs from G√∂del's are due to S. C. Kleene. :\\" In a forthcoming paper by Kleene to be entitled \\"General recursive functions of natural numbers,\\" ... it follows ... that every function recursive in the present sense is also recursive in the sense of G√∂del (1934) and conversely.\\"Church 1936 in (Davis 1965:95) Some time prior to Church's paper An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory (1936) a dialog occurred between G√∂del and Church as to whether or not Œª-definability was sufficient for the definition of the notion of \\"algorithm\\" and \\"effective calculability\\". In Church (1936) we see, under the chapter ¬ß7 The notion of effective calculability, a footnote 18 which states the following: :\\"18The question of the relationship between effective calculability and recursiveness (which it is here proposed to answer by identifying the two notions) was raised by G√∂del in conversation with the author. The corresponding question of the relationship between effective calculability and Œª-definability had previously been proposed by the author independently.\\" Church 1936 in (Davis 1965:100) By \\"identifying\\" Church means ‚Äì not \\"establishing the identity of\\" ‚Äì but rather \\"to cause to be or become identical\\", \\"to conceive as united\\" (as in spirit, outlook or principle) (vt form), and (vi form) as \\"to be or become the same\\".Merriam-Webster 1983:identifying Post and \\"effective calculability\\" as \\"natural law\\" Post's doubts as to whether or not recursion was an adequate definition of \\"effective calculability\\", plus the publishing of Church's paper, encouraged him in the fall of 1936 to propose a \\"formulation\\" with \\"psychological fidelity\\": A worker moves through \\"a sequence of spaces or boxes\\"Post 1936 in (Davis 1965:289) performing machine-like \\"primitive acts\\" on a sheet of paper in each box. The worker is equipped with \\"a fixed ualterable set of directions\\". Each instruction consists of three or four symbols: (1) an identifying label/number, (2) an operation, (3) next instruction ji; however, if the instruction is of type (e) and the determination is \\"yes\\" THEN instruction ji' ELSE if it is \\"no\\" instruction ji. The \\"primitive acts\\" are of only 1 of 5 types: (a) mark the paper in the box he's in (or over-mark a mark already there), (b) erase the mark (or over-erase), (c) move one room to the right, (d) move one room to the left, (e) determine if the paper is marked or blank. The worker starts at step 1 in the starting-room, and does what the instructions instruct them to do. (See more at Post‚ÄìTuring machine.) This matter, mentioned in the introduction about \\"intuitive theories\\" caused Post to take a potent poke at Church: :\\"The writer expects the present formulation to turn out to be logically equivalent to recursiveness in the sense of the G√∂del-Church development.7 Its purpose, however, is not only to present a system of a certain logical potency but also, in its restricted field, of psychological fidelity. In the latter sense wider and wider formulations are contemplated. On the other hand, our aim will be to show that all such are logically reducible to formulation 1. We offer this conclusion at the present moment as a working hypothesis. And to our mind such is Church's identification of effective calculability with recursivness.8\\" (italics in original) ::7 [he sketches an approach to a proof] ::8 \\"Cf. Church, lock. cit, pp. 346, 356-358. Actually the work already done by Church and others carries this identification considerably beyond the working hypothesis stage. But to mask this identification under a definition hides the fact that a fundamental discovery in the limitiations of mathematicizing power of Homo Sapiens has been made and blinds us to the need of its continual verification.\\"italics added, Post 1936 in (Davis 1965:291) In other words Post is saying \\"Just because you defined it so doesn't make it truly so; your definition is based on no more than an intuition.\\" Post was searching for more than a definition: \\"The success of the above program would, for us, change this hypothesis not so much to a definition or to an axiom but to a natural law. Only so, it seems to the writer, can G√∂del's theorem ... and Church's results ... be transformed into conclusions concerning all symbolic logics and all methods of solvability.\\"Italics in original, Post in (Davis 1965:291) This contentious stance finds grumpy expression in Alan Turing 1939, and it will reappear with G√∂del, Gandy, and Sieg. Turing and computability A. M. Turing's paper On Computable Numbers, With an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem was delivered to the London Mathematical Society in November 1936. Again the reader must bear in mind a caution: as used by Turing, the word \\"computer\\" is a human being, and the action of a \\"computer\\" he calls \\"computing\\"; for example, he states \\"Computing is normally done by writing certain symbols on paper\\" (p. 135). But he uses the word \\"computation\\" in (Davis 1967:118) in the context of his machine-definition, and his definition of \\"computable\\" numbers is as follows: :\\"The \\"computable\\" numbers may be described briefly as the real numbers whose expressions as a decimal are calculable by finite means ... .According to my definition, a number is computable if its decimal can be written down by a machine.\\" in (Davis 1967:116) What is Turing's definition of his \\"machine?\\" Turing gives two definitions, the first a summary in ¬ß1 Computing machines and another very similar in ¬ß9.I derived from his more detailed analysis of the actions a human \\"computer\\". With regards to his definition ¬ß1 he says that \\"justification lies in the fact that the human memory is necessarily limited\\", in (Davis 1967:117) and he concludes ¬ß1 with the bald assertion of his proposed machine with his use of the word \\"all\\" :\\"It is my contention that these operations [write symbol on tape-square, erase symbol, shift one square left, shift one square right, scan square for symbol and change machine-configuration as a consequence of one scanned symbol] include all those which are used in the computation of a number.\\" The emphasis of the word one in the above brackets is intentional. With regards to ¬ß9.I he allows the machine to examine more squares; it is this more-square sort of behavior that he claims typifies the actions of a computer (person): :\\"The machine scans B squares corresponding to the B squares observed by the computer. In any move the machine can change a symbol on a scanned square or can change any one of the scanned squares to another square distant not more than L squares from one of the other scanned squares ... The machines just described do not differ very essentially from computing machines as defined in ¬ß2 [sic], and corresponding to any machine of this type a computing machine can be constructed to compute the same sequence, that is to say the sequence computed by the computer.\\" in (Davis 1967:138) Turing goes on to define a \\"computing machine\\" in ¬ß2 is (i) \\"a-machine\\" (\\"automatic machine\\") as defined in ¬ß1 with the added restriction (ii): (ii) It prints two kinds of symbols ‚Äì figures 0 and 1 ‚Äì and other symbols. The figures 0 and 1 will represent \\"the sequence computed by the machine\\". Furthermore, to define the if the number is to be considered \\"computable\\", the machine must print an infinite number of 0's and 1's; if not it is considered to be \\"circular\\"; otherwise it is considered to be \\"circle-free\\": :\\"A number is computable if it differs by an integer from the number computed by a circle-free machine.\\" in (Davis 1967:119) Although he doesn't call it his \\"thesis\\", Turing proposes a proof that his \\"computability\\" is equivalent to Church's \\"effective calculability\\": :\\"In a recent paper Alonzo Church has introduced an idea of \\"effective calculability\\", which is equivalent to my \\"computability\\", but is very differently defined ... The proof of equivalence between \\"computability\\" and \\"effective calculability\\" is outlined in an appendix to the present paper.\\" The Appendix: Computability and effective calculability begins in the following manner; observe that he does not mention recursion here, and in fact his proof-sketch has his machine munch strings of symbols in the Œª-calculus and the calculus munch \\"complete configurations\\" of his machine, and nowhere is recursion mentioned. The proof of the equivalence of machine-computability and recursion must wait for Kleene 1943 and 1952: :\\"The theorem that all effectively calculable (Œª-definable) sequences are computable and its converse are proved below in outline.\\" in (Davis 1967:149) Gandy (1960) seems to confuse this bold proof-sketch with Church's Thesis; see 1960 and 1995 below. Moreover a careful reading of Turing's definitions leads the reader to observe that Turing was asserting that the \\"operations\\" of his proposed machine in ¬ß1 are sufficient to compute any computable number, and the machine that imitates the action of a human \\"computer\\" as presented in ¬ß9.I is a variety of this proposed machine. This point will be reiterated by Turing in 1939. Turing identifies effective calculability with machine computation Alan Turing's massive Princeton PhD thesis (under Alonzo Church) appears as Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals. In it he summarizes the quest for a definition of \\"effectively calculable\\". He proposes a definition as shown in the boldface type that specifically identifies (renders identical) the notions of \\"machine computation\\" and \\"effectively calculable\\". :\\"A function is said to be \\"effectively calculable\\" if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process. Although it is fairly easy to get an intuitive grasp of this idea, it is nevertheless desirable to have some more definite, mathematically expressible definition. Such a definition was first given by G√∂del at Princeton in 1934 ... . These functions are described as \\"general recursive\\" by G√∂del ... . Another definition of effective calculability has been given by Church ... who identifies it with Œª-definability. The author has recently suggested a definition corresponding more closely to the intuitive idea (Turing [1], see also Post's [1]). It was stated above that \\"a function is effectively calculable if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process\\". We may take this statement literally, understanding by a purely mechanical process one which could be carried out by a machine. It is possible to give a mathematical description, in a certain normal form, of the structures of these machines. The development of these ideas leads to the author's definition of a computable function, and to an identification of computability ‚Ä† with effective calculability. It is not difficult, though somewhat laborious, to prove that these three definitions are equivalent.Kleene [3], Turing [2] ::\\"‚Ä† We shall use the expression \\"computable function\\" to mean a function calculable by a machine, and we let \\"effectively calculable\\" refer to the intuitive idea without particular identification with any one of these definitions. We do not restrict the values taken by a computable function to be natural numbers; we may for instance have computable propositional functions.\\"boldface added, Turing 1939 in (Davis 1965:160) This is a powerful expression. because \\"identicality\\" is actually an unequivocal statement of necessary and sufficient conditions, in other words there are no other contingencies to the identification\\" except what interpretation is given to the words \\"function\\", \\"machine\\", \\"computable\\", and \\"effectively calculable\\": :: For all functions: IF \\"this function is computable by machine\\" THEN \\"this function is effectively calculable\\" AND IF \\"this function is effectively calculable\\" THEN \\"this function is computable by a machine.\\" Rosser: recursion, Œª-calculus, and Turing-machine computation identity J. B. Rosser's paper An Informal Exposition of Proofs of G√∂del's Theorem and Church's TheoremRosser 1939 in (Davis 1967:223-230) states the following: :\\"'Effective method' is here used in the rather special sense of a method each step of which is precisely predetermined and which is certain to produce the answer in a finite number of steps. With this special meaning, three different precise definitions have been given to date5. The simplest of these to state (due to Post and Turing) says essentially that an effective method of solving a certain set of problems exists if one can build a machine which will then solve any problem of the set with no human intervention beyond inserting the question and (later) reading the answer. All three definitions are equivalent, so it does not matter which one is used. Moreover, the fact that all three are equivalent is a very strong argument for the correctness of any one. ::5 One definition is given by Church in I [i.e. Church 1936 An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number theory]. Another definition is due to Jacques Herbrand and Kurt G√∂del. It is stated in I, footnote 3, p. 346. The third definition was given independently in two slightly different forms by E. L. Post ... and A. M. Turing ... . The first two definitions are proved equivalent in I. The third is proved equivalent to the first two by A. M. Turing, Computability and Œª-definability [Journal of Symbolic Logic, vol. 2 (1937), pp. 153-163].\\" quote and footnote from Rosser 1939 in (Davis 1967:225-226) Kleene and Thesis I Kleene defines \\"general recursive\\" functions and \\"partial recursive functions\\" in his paper Recursive Predicates and Quantifiers. The representing function, mu-operator, etc make their appearance. He goes on in ¬ß12 Algorithm theories to state his famous Thesis I, what he would come to call Church's Thesis in 1952: :\\"This heuristic fact, as well as certain reflections on the nature of symbolic algorithmic processes, led Church to state the following thesis22. The same thesis is implicitly in Turing's description of computing machines23. ::\\"Thesis I. Every effectively calculable function (effectively decidable predicate) is general recursive. :\\"Since a precise mathematical definition of the term effectively calculable (effectively decidable) has been wanting, we can take this thesis, together with the principle already accepted to which it is converse, as a definition of it ... the thesis has the character of an hypothesis ‚Äì a point emphasized by Post and by Church24. :::22 Church [1] [An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory]Church 1936a in (Davis 1965:88ff) :::23 Turing [1] [On Computable numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem(1936)], in (Davis 1965:115ff) :::24 Post [1, p. 105],Post, 1936, Finite combinatory processes - Formulation 1, The Journal of Symbolic Logic, Vol. 1, No. 3 (Sep., 1936), pp. 103-105 and Church [2] Church, 1938, The constructive second number class, Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. vol. 44, Number 4, 1938, pp. 224-232] Kleene and Church and Turing theses In his chapter ¬ß60, Kleene defines the \\"Church's thesis\\" as follows: :\\" ... heuristic evidence and other considerations led Church 1936 to propose the following thesis. ::\\"Thesis I. Every effectively calculable function (effectively decidable predicate) is general recursive. :\\"This thesis is also implicit in the conception of a computing machine formulated by Turing 1936-7 and Post 1936.\\"Kleene 1952 in (Davis 1965:300-301) On page 317 he explicitly calls the above thesis \\"Church's thesis\\": :\\"¬ß62. Church's thesis. One of the main objectives of this and the next chapter is to present the evidence for Church's thesis (Thesis I ¬ß60).\\" Kleene 1952 in (Davis 1965:317) About Turing's \\"formulation\\", Kleene says: :\\"Turing's formulation hence constitutes an independent statement of Church's thesis (in equivalent terms). Post 1936 gave a similar formulation.\\"Post 1936:321 Kleene proposes that what Turing showed: \\"Turing's computable functions (1936-1937) are those which can be computed by a machine of a kind which is designed, according to his analysis, to reproduce all the sorts of operations which a human computer could perform, working according to preassigned instructions.\\" Kleene 1952 in (Davis 1965:321) This interpretation of Turing plays into Gandy's concern that a machine specification may not explicitly \\"reproduce all the sorts of operations which a human computer could perform\\" ‚Äì i.e. his two examples are (i) massively symbol-parallel computation and two-dimensional computation e.g. Conway's \\"game of life\\".cf. Gandy 1978 in (Barwise et al 1980:125) Therefore there may be processes that can \\"compute more\\" than a Turing machine can. See 1980 below. Kleene defines Turing's Thesis as follows: :\\"¬ß70. Turing's thesis. Turing's thesis that every function which would naturally be regarded as computable under his definition, i.e. by one of his machines, is equivalent to Church's thesis by Theorem XXX.\\" Indeed immediately before this statement, Kleene states the Theorem XXX: ::\\"Theorem XXX (= Theorems XXVIII + XXIX). The following classes of partial functions are coextensive, i.e. have the same members: (a) the partial recursive functions, (b) the computable functions, (c) the 1/1 computable functions. Similarly with l [lower-case L] completely defined assumed functions Œ®.\\" G√∂del, Turing machines, and effectively calculability To his 1931 paper On Formally Undecidable Propositions, G√∂del added a Note added 28 August 1963 which clarifies his opinion of the alternative forms/expression of \\"a formal system\\". He reiterates his opinions even more clearly in 1964 (see below): :\\"Note Added 28 August 1963. In consequence of later advances, in particular of the fact that due to A. M. Turing's work69 a precise and unquestionably adequate definition of the general notion of formal system70 can now be given, a completely general version of Theorems VI and XI is now possible. That is, it can be proved rigorously that in every consistent formal system that contains a certain amount of finitary number theory there exist undecidable arithmetic propositions and that, moreover, the consistency of any such system cannot be proved in the system. ::\\"69 See ', p. 249. :::\\"70 In my opinion the term \\"formal system\\" or \\"formalism\\" should never be used for anything but this notion. In a lecture at Princeton (mentioned in Princeton University 1946, p. 11 [see Davis 1965, pp. 84-88 [i.e. Davis p. 84-88] ]), I suggested certain transfinite generalizations of formalisms, but these are something radically different from formal systems in the proper sense of the term, whose characteristic property is that reasoning in them, in principle, can be completely replaced by mechanical devices.\\"G√∂del 1963 in (van Heijenoort 1976:616) G√∂del 1964 ‚Äì In G√∂del's Postscriptum to his lecture's notes of 1934 at the IAS at Princeton,Due to the language difference, G√∂del refers to the IAS as \\"AIS\\" he repeats, but reiterates in even more bold terms, his less- than-glowing opinion about the efficacy of computability as defined by Church's Œª-definability and recursion (we have to infer that both are denigrated because of his use of the plural \\"definitions\\" in the following). This was in a letter to Martin Davis (presumably as he was assembling The Undecidable). The repeat of some of the phrasing is striking: :\\"In consequence of later advances, in particular of the fact, that, due to A. M. Turing's work, a precise and unquestionably adequate definition of the general concept of formal system can now be given, the existence of undecidable arithmetical propositions and the non-demonstrability of the consistence of a system in the same system can now be proved rigorously for every consistent formal system containing a certain amount of finitary number theory. :\\"Turing's work gives an analysis of the concept of \\"mechanical procedure\\" (alias \\"algorithm\\" or \\"computation procedure\\" or \\"finite combinatorial procedure\\"). This concept is shown to be equivalent to that of a \\"Turing machine\\".* A formal system can simply be defined to be any mechanical procedure for producing formulas, called provable formulas ... the concept of formal system, whose essence it is that reasoning is completely replaced by mechanical operations on formulas. (Note that the question of whether there exist finite non-mechanical procedures ... not equivalent with any algorithm, has nothing whatsoever to do with the adequacy of the definition of \\"formal system\\" and of \\"mechanical procedure. :\\"... if \\"finite procedure\\" is understood to mean \\"mechanical procedure\\", the question raised in footnote 3 can be answered affirmatively for recursiveness as defined in ¬ß9, which is equivalent to general recursiveness as defined today (see S. C. Kleene (1936) ...)\\" G√∂del 1934 in (Davis 1967:71-73) ::\\" * See ... and the almost simultaneous paper by E. L. Post (1936) ... . As for previous equivalent definitions of computability, which however, are much less suitable for our purpose, see A. Church 1936 ...\\"G√∂del 1934 in (Davis 1967:72) Footnote 3 is in the body of the 1934 lecture notes: :\\"3 The converse seems to be true, if besides recursions according to the scheme (2) recursions of other forms (e.g., with respect to two variables simultaneously) are admitted. This cannot be proved, since the notion of finite computation is not defined, but it serves as a heuristic principle.\\"G√∂del 1934 in (Davis 1967:44) Davis does observe that \\"in fact the equivalence between his [G√∂del's] definition [of recursion] and Kleene's [1936] is not quite trivial. So, despite appearances to the contrary, footnote 3 of these lectures is not a statement of Church's thesis.\\"G√∂del 1934 in (Davis 1967:40) Gandy: \\"machine computation\\", discrete, deterministic, and limited to \\"local causation\\" by light speed Robin Gandy's influential paper titled Church's Thesis and Principles for Mechanisms appears in Barwise et al. Gandy starts off with an unlikely expression of Church's Thesis, framed as follows: :\\"1. Introduction :\\"Throughout this paper we shall use \\"calculable\\" to refer to some intuitively given notion and \\"computable\\" to mean \\"computable by a Turing machine\\"; of course many equivalent definitions of \\"computable\\" are now available. :\\"Church's Thesis. What is effectively calculable is computable. :\\" ... Both Church and Turing had in mind calculation by an abstract human being using some mechanical aids (such as paper and pencil)\\"Gandy in (Barwise 1980:123) Robert Soare (1995, see below) had issues with this framing, considering Church's paper (1936) published prior to Turing's \\"Appendix proof\\" (1937). Gandy attempts to \\"analyze mechanical processes and so to provide arguments for the following: :\\"Thesis M. What can be calculated by a machine is computable.\\" Gandy in (Barwise 1980:124 Gandy \\"exclude[s] from consideration devices which are essentially analogue machines ... .The only physical presuppositions made about mechanical devices (Cf Principle IV below) are that there is a lower bound on the linear dimensions of every atomic part of the device and that there is an upper bound (the velocity of light) on the speed of propagation of change\\".Gandy in (Barwise 1980:126) But then he restricts his machines even more: :\\"(2) Secondly we suppose that the progress of calculation by a mechanical device may be described in discrete terms, so that the devices considered are, in a loose sense, digital computers. :\\"(3) Lasty we suppose that the device is deterministic: that is, the subsequent behavior of the device is uniquely determined once a complete description of its initial state is given.\\" He in fact makes an argument for this \\"Thesis M\\" that he calls his \\"Theorem\\", the most important \\"Principle\\" of which is \\"Principle IV: Principle of local causation\\": :\\"Now we come to the most important of our principles. In Turing's analysis the requirement that the action depended only on a bounded portion of the record was based on a human limitation. We replace this by a physical limitation which we call the principle of local causation. Its justification lies in the finite velocity of propagation of effects and signals: contemporary physics rejects the possibility of instantaneous action at a distance.\\"Gandy in (Barwise 1980:135) In 1985 the \\"Thesis M\\" was adapted for Quantum Turing machine, resulting in a Church‚ÄìTuring‚ÄìDeutsch principle. Soare Soare's thorough examination of Computability and Recursion appears. He quotes G√∂del's 1964 opinion (above) with respect to the \\"much less suitable\\" definition of computability, and goes on to add: :\\"Kleene wrote [1981b, p. 49], \\"Turing's computability is intrinsically persuasive\\" but \\"Œª-definability is not intrinsically persuasive\\" and \\"general recursiveness scarcely so (its author G√∂del being at the time not at all persuaded) ... . Most people today accept Turing's Thesis\\"Soare 1996:13 Soare's footnote 7 (1995) also catches Gandy's \\"confusion\\", but apparently it continues into Gandy (1988). This confusion represents a serious error of research and/or thought and remains a cloud hovering over his whole program: :\\"7Gandy actually wrote \\"Church's thesis\\" not \\"Turing's thesis\\" as written here, but surely Gandy meant the latter, at least intensionally, because Turing did not prove anything in 1936 or anywhere else about general recursive functions.\\"Soare 1996:11 Breger and problem of tacit axioms Breger points out a problem when one is approaching a notion \\"axiomatically\\", that is, an \\"axiomatic system\\" may have imbedded in it one or more tacit axioms that are unspoken when the axiom-set is presented. For example, an active agent with knowledge (and capability) may be a (potential) fundamental axiom in any axiomatic system: \\"the know-how of a human being is necessary ‚Äì a know-how which is not formalized in the axioms. ¬∂ ... Mathematics as a purely formal system of symbols without a human being possessing the know-how with the symbols is impossible ...\\"Breger in (Groshoz and Breger 2002:221) He quotes Hilbert: : \\"In a university lecture given in 1905, Hilbert considered it \\"absolutely necessary\\" to have an \\"axiom of thought\\" or \\"an axiom of the existence of an intelligence\\" before stating the axioms in logic. In the margin of the script, Hilbert added later: \\"the a priori of the philosophers.\\" He formulated this axiom as follows: \\"I have the capacity to think of objects, and to denote them by means of simple symbols like a, b,..., x, y,..., so that they can be recognized unambiguously. My thought operates with these objects in a certain way according to certain rules, and my thinking is able to detect these rules by observation of myself, and completely to describe these rules\\" [(Hilbert 1905,219); see also (Peckhaus 1990, 62f and 227)].\\"brackets and references in original, Breger in (Groshoz and Breger 2002:227) Breger further supports his argument with examples from Giuseppe Veronese (1891) and Hermann Weyl (1930-1). He goes on to discuss the problem of then expression of an axiom-set in a particular language: i.e. a language known by the agent, e.g. German.Breger in (Groshoz and Breger 2002:228)Indeed, Breger gives a potent example of this in his paper (Breger in (Groshoz and Breger 2002:228-118)) See more about this at Algorithm characterizations, in particular Searle's opinion that outside any computation there must be an observer that gives meaning to the symbols used. Sieg and axiomatic definitions At the \\"Feferfest\\" ‚Äì Solomon Feferman's 70th birthday ‚Äì Wilfried Sieg first presents a paper written two years earlier titled \\"Calculations By Man and Machine: Conceptual Analysis\\", reprinted in (Sieg et al. 2002:390‚Äì409). Earlier Sieg published \\"Mechanical Procedures and Mathematical Experience\\" (in George 1994, p. 71ff) presenting a history of \\"calculability\\" beginning with Richard Dedekind and ending in the 1950s with the later papers of Alan Turing and Stephen Cole Kleene. The Feferfest paper distills the prior paper to its major points and dwells primarily on Robin Gandy's paper of 1980. Sieg extends Turing's \\"computability by string machine\\" (human \\"computor\\") as reduced to mechanism \\"computability by letter machine\\"Turing's thesis ‚Äì cf drawing p. 398 to the parallel machines of Gandy. Sieg cites more recent work including \\"Kolmogorov and Uspensky's work on algorithms\\" and (De Pisapia 2000), in particular, the KU-pointer machine-model), and artificial neural networksSieig 2002:399 and asserts: :\\"The separation of informal conceptual analysis and mathematical equivalence proof is essential for recognizing that the correctness of Turing's Thesis (taken generically) rests on two pillars; namely on the correctness of boundedness and locality conditions for computors, and on the correctness of the pertinent central thesis. The latter asserts explicitly that computations of a computor can be mimicked directly by a particular kind of machine. However satisfactory one may find this line of analytic argument, there are two weak spots: the looseness of the restrictive conditions (What are symbolic configurations? What changes can mechanical operations effect?) and the corresponding vagueness of the central thesis. We are, no matter how we turn ourselves, in a position that is methodologically still unsatisfactory ... .\\" He claims to \\"step toward a more satisfactory stance ... [by] abstracting further away from particular types of configurations and operations ...\\" :\\"It has been claimed frequently that Turing analyzed computations of machines. That is historically and systematically inaccurate, as my exposition should have made quite clear. Only in 1980 did Turing's student, Robin Gandy, characterize machine computations.\\" Whether the above statement is true or not is left to the reader to ponder. Sieg goes on to describe Gandy's analysis (see above 1980). In doing so he attempts to formalize what he calls \\"Gandy machines\\" (with a detailed analysis in an Appendix). About the Gandy machines: :\\" ... the definition of a Gandy machine is an \\"abstract\\" mathematical definition that embodies ... properties of parallel computations ... Second, Gandy machines share with groups and topological spaces the general feature of abstract axiomatic definitions, namely, that they admit a wide variety of different interpretations. Third, ... the computations of any Gandy machine can be simulated by a letter machine, [and] is best understood as a representation theorem for the axiomatic notion. [boldface added] :\\"The axiomatic approach captures the essential nature of computation processes in an abstract way. The difference between the two types of calculators I have been describing is reduced to the fact that Turing computors modify one bounded part of a state, whereas Gandy machines operate in parallel on arbitrarily many bounded parts. The representation theorems guarantee that models of the axioms are computationally equivalent to Turing machines in their letter variety.\\"Sieg 2002:404 Notes References * Barwise, Jon, H. J.

Background An-Nasir Yusuf was the great-grandson of Saladin. He became the Ayyubid ruler of Aleppo when he was 7 years old after the death of his father Al-Aziz Muhammad. His grandmother Dayfa Khatun, daughter of Al-Adil I, was his regent until her death in 1242. Conflict with Egyptian Mamluks When the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt as-Salih Ayyub died and his son Turanshah was murdered by the Bahri Mamluks of Egypt, Shajar al-Durr (widow of as-Salih Ayyub ) seized the throne of Egypt (1250). An-Nasir Yusuf, being an Ayyubid, refused to recognize Shajar al-Durr as the Sultana of Egypt and, as a sign of support, the Emirs of Syria granted him the city of Damascus, in Syria. Alarmed by these developments, the Mamluk leaders in Egypt decided to replace Shajar al Durr with the Atabek (commander in chief) Aybak. In October 1250 an-Nasir Yusuf sent forces to Gaza to conquer Egypt and overthrow Aybak, but Egyptian forces led by Faris ad-Din Aktai defeated them. In January 1251 an-Nasir Yusuf led another army to Egypt and clashed with Aybak's army in a significant battle with Yusuf's defeat. He fled back to Damascus, though some of his soldiers who could reach Cairo spread the initial impression inside Egypt that Yusuf had won the battle. Later when the news of Aybak's ultimate victory arrived, the soldiers and their commanders were arrested, and Aybak sent back the soldiers, some 3,000 in number, to Damascus on the backs of donkeys.al-Maqrizi al-Sham coastline. In 1253, through mediation of some Emirs, an accord was reached between an-Nasir Yusuf and Aybak which gave the Egyptians control over Gaza, Jerusalem, Nablus, and the coastline of al-Sham. In 1254, another power shift occurred in Egypt, as Aybak killed Faris ad-Din Aktai, the leader of the Bahri Mamluks. Some of his Mamluks, among them Baibars al-Bunduqdari and Qalawun al-Alfi, fled to an- Nasir Yusuf in Syria, persuading him to break the accord and invade Egypt. Aybak wrote to an-Nassir Yusuf warning him of the danger of these Mamluks who took refuge in Syria, and agreed to grant him their territorial domains on the coast, but an-Nasir Yusuf refused to expel them and instead returned to them the domains which Aybak had granted. In 1255 an-Nasir Yusuf sent new forces to the Egyptian border, this time with many of Aktai's Mamluks, among them Baibars al-Bunduqdari, and Qalawun al-Alfi, but he was defeated again. Relations with Crusaders Louis IX. An-Nasir had contact and correspondence with the European Crusaders, and tried to reach an accord with the barons of Acre. He indirectly suggested to King Louis IX of France the possibility of surrendering Jerusalem to Louis, in return for assistance in conquering Egypt. But Louis, who had already lost an army in Egypt during the Seventh Crusade and was still trying to free his imprisoned soldiers, was not willing yet to make such a deal. Louis did, however, send his royal armorer to Damascus to purchase materials to make crossbows, and in 1254, An-Nasir signed a truce with the Crusaders. The Mongols Hulagu's army sacked Baghdad in 1258. The Egyptian ruler Aybak was murdered in 1257 and his young son al-Mansur Ali, only 15 years old, became the new sultan, with Qutuz as vice-sultan. The following year (1258) the Mongols led by Hulagu Khan sacked Baghdad. Baibars al-Bunduqdari argued that an-Nasir Yusuf should mobilize his army and make preparations to fight the Mongols who were marching towards Syria. But instead, Yusuf sent his son al-Malik al-Aziz with a present to Hulagu, requesting Hulagu's assistance in invading Egypt. Hulagu's reply, however, was simply a warning that Yusuf should rapidly submit to Mongol authority. This answer frightened an-Nasir Yusuf, who at once sent a message to Egypt, requesting help. Saif ad-Din Qutuz, the vice-Sultan of Egypt decided to confront the Mongols. Arguing that Egypt could not face the approaching danger while ruled by a young boy, Qutuz proclaimed himself Sultan, and began to raise a large army, though he assured an-Nasir Yusuf that his action was only a temporarily measure till the danger of the Mongols was overcome. As the Mongols marched toward Aleppo, some of an-Nasir Yusuf's advisors recommended surrendering to Hulagu as the best solution. This angered Baibars and his Mamluks who attempted to assassinate an-Nasir Yusuf, but he escaped and fled with his brother to the castle of Damascus, also sending his wife, son, and money to Egypt. Many of the citizens of Damascus also fled to Egypt. The sack of Aleppo The Mongols arrived at Aleppo in December 1259. Turanshah, the uncle of an-Nasir Yusuf,Turanshah uncle of an-Nasir Yusuf, not to be confused with his namesake Turanshah son of sultan as-Salih Ayyub. refused to surrender. After a siege of seven days, the Mongols stormed Aleppo and massacred its population for another five days. Turanshah left the city and died a few days later. When the news of the sack of Aleppo reached an-Nasir Yusuf, he and his army fled towards Gaza on January 31, stopping at Nablus for several days and leaving a contingent which may have been intended as a rearguard. Damascus fell to the hands of the Mongols, under general Kitbuqa, 16 days after the sack of Aleppo. The Emirs of Damascus surrendered without resistance. After the capture of Damascus, some of the Mongol troops raided Palestine, and fought with an-Nasir's troops in the olive groves of Nablus, defeating the entire force. Once arriving at the border with Egypt, some Emirs of an-Nasir Yusuf abandoned him and joined Qutuz. An-Nasir Yusuf, his son al- Aziz, and his brother al-Zahir were abducted in Gaza by one of his servants and were sent to Hulagu,In another account, an-Nasir went to Kitbuga who arrested him and sent him to Hulagu. An-Nasir and his brother were executed, after Hulagu heard the news of the defeat of the Mongol army at Ain Jalut by an Egyptian army led by Qutuz and Baibars on September 3, 1260.

From a knightly family, he became a teacher before becoming a canon by 1115. He was elected prior of Llanthony Priory in the middle 1120s, and was named bishop by King Henry I of England in 1130. As bishop, he was often appointed a judge by the papacy, and was known for the care he took of his diocese. After Henry's death in 1135, Bethune first supported King Stephen, who seized the throne from Henry's heiress the Empress Matilda, but when Matilda's forces captured Stephen, Bethune switched sides to support Matilda. When Matilda did not secure the throne, Bethune once more switched back to supporting Stephen. Construction of Hereford Cathedral was completed under Bethune's episcopate, and consecrated in 1142 and 1148. Stephen appointed Bethune as one of the English bishops that the king allowed to attend the Council of Reims in 1148, and Bethune died there in April 1148. A hagiography is the only surviving evidence of Bethune's cathedral chapter's attempts to promote him as a saint. Early life Bethune was the youngest son of a knight, and was at first educated by his eldest brother,Barlow English Church p. 229 who was named Gunfrid and was a schoolmaster. Although the medieval chronicler Robert de Torigni describes Bethune as Flemish, Bethune's medieval biographer, William of Wycombe says that he and Bethune grew up in neighbouring villages in Buckinghamshire. It thus is likely that Bethune was born near Wingrave, Buckinghamshire, to a family descended from Flemish settlers.Barrow \\"B√©thune, Robert de\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography He was a schoolmaster in England, teaching elementary subjects, before he went to study theology under William of Champeaux and Anselm of Laon.Chibnall Anglo-Norman England p. 128Barlow English Church pp. 249‚Äì50 He was a canon of Llanthony Priory before 1115, and was elected prior of that house in the middle 1120s.Barrow Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 8: Hereford: Bishops Before becoming prior, he was entrusted with establishing a cell of the priory at Weobley, which had been established by Hugh de Lacy shortly before Lacy's death around 1115. Bishop of Hereford The see of Hereford had been vacant since 1127, and in 1130, King Henry I of England took the advice of the local magnates and nominated Bethune to the see. Bethune's diocesan bishop as prior, Urban, the Bishop of Llandaff, at first refused permission for Bethune's elevation. However, the archbishop of Canterbury, William of Corbeil, advised that the matter be referred to the papacy.Brett English Church pp. 53‚Äì55 Pope Innocent II ordered that Bethune be allowed to accept the see of Hereford in 1131.

In nominating Bethune, the king is said to have felt that he needed one \\"godly bishop\\" around.Brett English Church p. 112 Most of Henry's bishops were given their sees as rewards for royal service, and were not particularly noted for piety.Brett English Church pp. 105‚Äì111 Bethune was known as a strict Augustinian canon, a priest living a monastic life but not a monk. Bethune was often appointed a judge delegate by the papacy to try cases and disputes, which had been referred back to England by the popes.Knowles Monastic Order p. 253 The historian David Knowles said of Bethune that he was a man of wide outlook, with a great desire for reform.Knowles Monastic Order p. 297 He was praised by contemporaries for the care with which he selected men to serve as clergy in his diocese.Brett English Church pp. 119‚Äì120 He also held synods in his diocese, including two during the first year of his episcopate. Stephen's reign After the accession of King Stephen of England, Bethune supported Stephen and was often at his court. Stephen had seized the throne at King Henry's death, depriving Henry's surviving legitimate daughter and heiress, Matilda, of the throne. Matilda is usually known as the \\"Empress\\" because of her first marriage to the German Emperor Henry V, who died in 1125.Huscroft Ruling England pp. 71‚Äì74 Bethune accompanied Thurstan, the Archbishop of York, when Thurstan secured a truce between Stephen and the King of Scots, David shortly after the Battle of the Standard in 1138.Dalton \\"Churchmen and the Promotion of Peace\\" Viator p. 85 When the Empress Matilda landed in England in September 1139 in pursuit of the throne, one of the local magnates of Hereford, Miles of Gloucester supported Matilda, while Bethune continued to support Stephen. Miles' hostility drove Bethune from his diocese, and Miles was in control of Hereford in 1140, leaving Bethune to perform his episcopal duties in Shropshire. During this time, Bethune assisted Theobald of Bec, the new Archbishop of Canterbury, in consecrating Maurice as Bishop of Bangor. Bethune had earlier persuaded the bishop-elect to swear fealty to King Stephen, after Maurice had originally refused. Bethune's standing as a bishop known for his piety and independence of the king helped persuade Maurice that the homage was canonical.Saltman Theobald pp. 92‚Äì93 Sometime after Stephen was captured by the Empress' forces in 1141, Bethune switched sides, and he was with the Empress Matilda at Winchester on 4 March 1141, when Matilda claimed the throne of England. He also was present at the council that proclaimed Matilda \\"lady of the English\\" shortly thereafter. His diocese of Hereford was in the center of the lands that Matilda controlled,Chibnall Empress Matilda pp. 98‚Äì99 and he was one of the few bishops who was often in Matilda's court.Barlow English Church p. 96 However, Matilda was never crowned, being driven from London before her planned coronation could take place. One of her chief supporters was captured in late 1141, and to secure his release, Matilda released Stephen from captivity, thus prolonging the conflict. Between 1142 and 1148, England was in a state of civil war, with parts of the country supporting Matilda and parts supporting Stephen. Welsh raids at the beginning of Stephen's reign had driven Bethune's former canons from Llanthony and the bishop gave them refuge at Hereford before establishing them at a new site near Gloucester. The land the canons were settled on had belonged to the diocese, and this led Bethune into conflict with his cathedral chapter, led by their dean, Ralph. Bethune was forced to travel to Pisa to secure an order from Innocent II declaring that the chapter obey their bishop. Around 1142, Bethune was involved with a conflict with Miles of Gloucester, who was now the Earl of Hereford, which led to the bishop excommunicating Miles and all the inhabitants of the city of Hereford, and \\"had the doors of the church blocked with thorns and the crosses taken down and placed on the ground\\".Quoted in Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 448 This dispute arose over an attempt by Miles to tax the churches in his earldom, which Bethune regarded as unlawful. Miles died in 1143 which ended the dispute over the taxes. Also after his death Bethune was free to leave Empress' faction and thus returned to supporting Stephen. In 1142, Hereford Cathedral, which had begun under Robert de Losinga around 1079, was finally ready for consecration. The work was finally completed in 1148, and it was once consecrated in that year.Wischermann \\"Romanesque Architecture\\" Romanesque p. 226 The year 1148 also saw the departure of Matilda from England, as her support had dwindled over the previous few years and Stephen was able to secure control of most of England. He was never able to completely remove Matilda's supporters, however.Huscroft Ruling England p. 75 King Stephen gave permission for some of England's bishops, including Bethune, to attend the Council of Reims in 1148.Matthew King Stephen pp. 199‚Äì200 Stephen had expelled the papal legates, or representatives, who arrived in England to summon the bishops to Reims, and after that appointed three of the bishops as representatives of the English Church. These three, Bethune, Hilary of Chichester, and William de Turbeville, were allowed to attend the council. Theobald of Bec was expressly forbidden to attend, but he managed to evade those watching him and arrived in Reims along with his clerk, Thomas Becket.Saltman Theobald pp. 25‚Äì26 Death and legacy Bethune died on 16 April 1148 at Reims just after the close of the Council of Reims.Crouch Reign of King Stephen p. 305 As his corpse returned to Hereford, miracles were alleged to have taken place along its route.Barlow English Church p. 100 He was buried in Hereford Cathedral.Boker \\"Bishop's Chapel\\" Gesta p. 47 Bethune's episcopal acta, or his decisions and other documents relating to his episcopal career, have been published in the English Episcopal Acta series, in the volume relating to the diocese of Hereford. A medieval catalogue of works at Llanthony Priory also recorded that they owned a collection of letters by Bethune, but this has not survived. A Life, or hagiography, giving his life and miracles, was written about him,Barlow English Church p. 23 by one of the Bethune's canons, William of Wycombe.Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings pp. 461‚Äì462 It contains few details of Bethune's life itself. Instead, it is an attempt by his canons to secure sainthood for Bethune.Barlow English Church p. 88 Although the life describes miracles that took place at Bethune's tomb, no evidence survives of a formal cult being developed, and he was never canonised. The historian Avram Saltman called him \\"the model bishop of his time\\", because of his care for his diocese and his abilities.Saltman Theobald p. 14 Notes Citations References          Category:Bishops of Hereford Category:12th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:1148 deaths Category:Burials at Hereford Cathedral Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Robert de Bethune"},{"id":"13051060","title":"Kwari"},{"id":"13051070","text":"Adolphus Peter Nelson (March 28, 1872 - August 21, 1927) was a U.S. Representative from Wisconsin.

He was a relative of a number of English ecclesiastics, including Gilbert Foliot, one of his predecessors at Hereford. After serving Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln as a clerk, he became a clerk of Henry of Blois, the Bishop of Winchester and brother of King Stephen of England. He attended the Council of Reims in 1148, where another relative, Robert de Chesney, was elected as Bishop of Hereford. Chesney then secured the office of Archdeacon of Oxford for Foliot. During the early 1160s, Foliot also served as a clerk for Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, but left the archbishop's service as Becket's dispute with the king began to intensify. He was elected to Hereford in 1173, and served as a royal and papal judge while bishop. Archeological evidence links the building of the Bishop's Palace at Hereford to his episcopate. After his death, Foliot was buried in Hereford Cathedral. Early life Robert Foliot was a relative of both Gilbert Foliot, Bishop of Hereford and Bishop of London, and of Robert de Chesney, Bishop of Lincoln. Another relative was Ralph Foliot, a royal justice.Turner English Judiciary p. 91 Robert Foliot's family appears to have been the branch of the Foliot family that owned the manor of Warpsgrove in Oxfordshire. This is made likely by Foliot's confirmation of a gift of land from Ralph Foliot of Warpsgrove to Ralph's son, and it is possible that Foliot was the brother or uncle of Ralph Foliot.Barrow \\"Foliot, Robert\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography There is no evidence of Foliot's education, but he likely received an education to fit him for his career in the church. Bibliographers have frequently confused him with his predecessor as bishop, Robert of Melun, so he has mistakenly been given as the author of a number of documents. Clerical career Foliot was a canon of Lincoln Cathedral by 1147,Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 3: Lincoln: Prebendaries: Langford Ecclesia and an official of Alexander of Lincoln, the Bishop of Lincoln, who secured Foliot's early promotions in the church. Foliot was sent to the Council of Reims in 1148 by the Lincoln cathedral chapter to learn Pope Eugene III's wishes regarding the vacant bishopric, as Alexander had died in February 1148. Henry of Blois, the Bishop of Winchester, was attempting to secure Lincoln for one of his nephews, but the pope agreed with the chapter and appointed Robert de Chesney as bishop instead. After his consecration, Chesney continued to employ Foliot as a clerk. Foliot was later named Archdeacon of Oxford in the Lincoln diocese, sometime before 1 October 1151, owing the appointment to Chesney. He was also a canon of Hereford Cathedral,Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 3: Lincoln: Archdeacons: Oxford appearing in that capacity in 1173, but it is unclear when exactly he acquired the position. It is also unclear whether he owed this position to his relative Gilbert Foliot, who was bishop of Hereford from 1148 to 1163, or if he received the canonry after 1163 through royal influence. Foliot served as a clerk for Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury,Barlow Thomas Becket p. 78 witnessing three documents for Becket during the period 1162‚Äì1164.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 81 During early days of Becket's dispute with the king, Foliot helped mediate between Becket and Gilbert Foliot, who was supporting the king. Robert Foliot was one of the first of Becket's clerks to leave the archbishop's service, asking permission to leave Becket's household shortly after the council at Clarendon in January 1164, which ratified the Constitutions of Clarendon.Barlow Thomas Becket pp.98‚Äì100 Bishop of Hereford Foliot was elected to the see of Hereford in late April 1173 and consecrated on 6 October 1174Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 250 at Canterbury by Archbishop Richard of Dover. Hereford had been vacant since the death of Robert of Melun in 1167, due to the Becket's exile and then death. Foliot was either elected by the cathedral chapter without guidance from the king,Warren Henry II pp. 534‚Äì535 or was nominated to the cathedral chapter by King Henry at the urging of his relative Gilbert Foliot. Robert Foliot later attended the Third Lateran Council in 1179.Barrow Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 8: Hereford: Bishops While bishop, he became involved in a dispute with Hugh Parvus, a local baron, over the power of appointment to two churches.Cheney Roger of Worcester p. 95 He also served as a judge-delegate for the papacy, serving with Roger, the Bishop of Worcester on cases including one between a Norman monastery and an English priory.Cheney Roger of Worcester p. 129 He judged a number of other cases for the papacy during his time as bishop.Cheney Roger of Worcester p. 131Cheney Roger of Worcester p. 142 He received over 40 surviving papal commissions and communications, some of which dealt with the problems of married clergy in his diocese. From his ecclesiastical documents, almost 40 survive. While bishop, Foliot gave books, altar furnishings, and land to his cathedral chapter, as well as a purple and gold cape to Wigmore Abbey. Although no documentary evidence links him to the timbered hall in the bishop's palace at Hereford, tree-ring dating of the timbers has dated its construction to 1179, during his time as bishop. He also gave money to the Bishop's Chapel in Hereford Cathedral.B√∂ker \\"Bishop's Chapel\\" Gesta p. 48 Death and legacy Foliot died on 9 May 1186, and was buried in Hereford Cathedral.

Bishop of Hereford Giles was elected as Bishop of Hereford in about 19 September 1200 and consecrated on 24 September 1200, at Westminster. The cathedral chapter had previously attempted to elect Walter Map, but the death of King Richard I of England prevented Map's election. He owed his election to his father's position with the king, and continued to receive gifts and grants from the king for the next four years. He was also granted custody of the castle of Bishop's Castle in southern Shropshire.Holden \\"King John and the Braoses\\" Albion p. 5 Giles was probably responsible for the building of the tower of Brecon Cathedral and is depicted in a window in the north aisle. He may also have then been responsible for the building of the tower of Hereford Cathedral as his alabaster effigy can be seen there today and he holds a tower on his chest. Over 50 documents from Giles' time as bishop survive, which show him to have had a good knowledge of canon law. He was often employed by the papacy as a judge-delegate, hearing cases referred back to England from Rome. Since Hereford was on the Welsh Marches, Giles was involved in the politics and disputes of the border lands, including a dispute between King John and Gwenwynwyn ab Owain of Powys, which was resolved around 1204. Troubles with John In late 1206 John appointed a new sheriff of Herefordshire, who appears to have put pressure on both Braoses, father and son. Giles may have been a hostage for his father's behavior in April and May 1208, before escaping and going into exile in France in late May 1208. While he was in exile, he joined a group of other English exiles that were trying to get aid from King Philip II of France against John. Giles' mother and elder brother were starved to death in 1210 on John's orders, and this probably increased his distrust and dislike of John. Giles aided Llywelyn ab Iorwerth's efforts to make an alliance with King Philip, which bore fruit in 1212. Return to England Giles was able to return to England in 1213, where he at first was on good terms with John, who restored some lands to him. The bishop, however, was concerned that the lands of his nephews, the sons of his elder brother William, were not returned to them, and in May 1214 efforts to find a compromise with the king failed. John then confiscated some of the bishop's lands and granted them to another. This led Giles to join the barons opposing John, and in conjunction with the Welsh leader Llywelyn the Great, to raze Hugh de Mortimer's castle at Wigmore, Herefordshire. Hugh was the lone marcher baron to side with John. In October 1214, the marcher lords and John were reconciled, and Giles rejoined the royal court. After Llywelyn's revolt in May 1215, Giles and his brother Reginald de Braose seized their ancestral lands and the bishop himself took a number of the castles. In October 1215, Giles was reconciled with the king, and paid a fine of 9000 marks to assure his possessions. It appears that in 1215, Giles had custody of his father's lands, along with his nephew John, as in March of that year a fine was recorded against Giles for the custody of the estates, and on 10 May 1215 a writ was issued allowing him to have the case judged. However, while Giles returned to the king's faction by autumn of 1215, Reginald did not.Holden \\"King John and the Braoses\\" Albion pp. 13‚Äì14 Giles died 17 November 1215,Fryde, et al.

Original Bar Located on 107 N. Block Ave. It is one of the oldest bars in Northwest Arkansas. Marjorie Maxine Miller opened the bar in 1950 when she was 24 years old with money she borrowed from her parents. She managed to pay her parents back within the year. In 1960 she tore down the old wooden building in which the bar had been located and had the current building‚Äîa long, narrow brick structure‚Äîbuilt in its place. The new building had only one window, exactly by , in the front, which was the minimum size allowed by the building codes at the time. This was more than likely a business decision aimed at limiting break-ins. Other examples of Miller's shrewd business style include keeping a club behind the bar, having only a pay phone available, and trying to hire football players as employees so the team would follow as patrons, a business style that led to the bar's longevity and success. Adding to the Tap Room's charm were a -long bar that stretched nearly the entire length of the building and dominated the room, an old coin-operated cigarette machine, a juke box that still played 45s, and a deer head adorned with Mardi Gras beads, sunglasses and a tie. Miller was a constant figure behind the cash register for 50 years until her health started to decline around 2000. She died at age 82 in May 2006. A month later the Tap Room caught fire. Due to lack of insurance the bar was closed for over a year, reopening in August 2007. Most of the furniture inside the bar was replaced, including the bar. The exposed rafters darkened by the fire were simply painted black, and a skylight was installed where the roof had burned through. Considerable efforts were made to retain many things that had been in the bar for a very long time, such as the older lights and signs.

He got his PhD from Uppsala University in 1916 and took up teaching at the Teachers Training College in Uppsala and at a high school. In 1930 he was appointed lecturer at the high school in Uppsala (Uppsala H√∂gre Allm√§nna L√§roverk). In 1930 he was also awarded the title of Docent by the university, and, some years later, in 1948, the government awarded him the honorary title of professor. He is known, to scholars of Antisemitism and the history of Jews in Sweden, for his significant work, part of which has been translated into English. In October 1942 he wrote a well-documented article on the Holocaust in the respected and influential daily newspaper G√∂teborgs Handels- och Sj√∂fartstidning. Based on available data he claimed that the Nazis had murdered 700,000 Jews in Poland. The article was widely quoted in Sweden. The Hugo Valentin Centre is named after the Swedish historian and is an inter-disciplinary forum at Uppsala University with research as its prime task. Research is carried out within two prioritized areas: on the one hand cultural and social phenomena and processes of change related to the ethnic dimension in human life, on the other hand the Holocaust and other cases of genocide and severe crimes against human rights. To these subject fields belong minority studies and Holocaust and genocide studies as well as related and adjacent subjects where the Centre has a marked specialisation: Holocaust history, massive violence, discrimination, multilingualism, migration and integration. Conditions in the Nordic countries and in the Balkans have a special position, and culture, language, history and religion are natural points of departure for the Centre's work. The Centre's activities encompass research, education at post-graduate level, documentation and information. In addition to its own research, the Centre also is explicitly charged with the task of stimulating and initiating studies of its subject areas within Uppsala University. The Centre also has the task of disseminating knowledge about the areas' research problems and research results in the light of international and global perspectives, discussions and conditions. Against the backdrop of its tasks and focus, the Centre should constitute a resource for education at Uppsala University, primarily on the higher levels. The Hugo Valentin Centre was established at Uppsala University's Faculty of Arts in November 2009 through a merging of two previous units, the Centre for Multiethnic Research and The Uppsala Programme for Holocaust and Genocide Studies. The new unit started its work under the new name on 1 January 2010.

Although educated and given the title of magister, or \\"master\\", the details of his schooling are unknown. Mapenor was a clerk for Giles de Braose, his predecessor as bishop. Later, Mapenor served as Dean of Hereford before being elected as bishop against the wishes of King John of England. During his short episcopate, he supported John's son and successor King Henry III of England, and was active in his diocese, as a number of surviving documents show. He also served as a diplomat for the king. Early life Mapenor was the son of Robert de Mapenore and his wife Matilda, who lived in Herefordshire at Hampton, Herefordshire near Leominster.Barrow Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 8: Hereford:Bishops Where or how he was educated is unknown, but he was given the title of magister, which implies he studied at some school and attained a degree of education.Barrow \\"Mapenore, Hugh de\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Mapenor served William de Braose as a clerk from 1189 to 1196, and then served William's son Giles de Braose, Bishop of Hereford. He occupied the office of Dean of Hereford before 29 September 1202.Barrow Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 8: Hereford: Deans of Hereford During his time at Hereford, he was the subject of the Prose Salernitan Questions, which compared his sexual powers to three other clerks. He also served as a judge for the papacy and defended the cathedral chapter in two disputes over the chapter's rights. When the Braose family fled England in 1208, with Giles going to France and William going to Ireland, Mapenor left also, going to Ireland where he appears as a witness on documents of William de Braose's. It is unclear when he returned to England, but by January 1212 Mapenor was once more in Hereford. Bishop of Hereford Mapenor was elected to the see of Hereford on 3 February 1216.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 250 Mapenor was elected by the cathedral chapter in spite of the fact that his name was not on the list of possible candidates given the chapter by King John of England. The king objected to the election, and took the case to Pope Honorius III, but the king died before the case was decided. John had objected because he claimed the cathedral chapter, who elected Mapenor, was excommunicate when they met for the election of the new bishop, which would have made the election invalid. His election had been overseen by the papal legate Guala Bicchieri,Vincent Peter des Roches p. 166 who was also assigned the case by the papacy after John objected. Bicchieri decided the case shortly after the death of John on the night of 18‚Äì19 October 1216, in Mapenor's favour. Mapenor gave Stephen Langton, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Mapenor's ecclesiastical superior, a declaration of obedience on 27 October 1216, and was consecrated on 18 December 1216 by Sylvester the Bishop of Worcester. Although Mapenor's time as bishop was short ‚Äì just over two years ‚Äì over 20 of his charters survive. These include a number for Leominster Priory and Reading Abbey. He also dealt with a dispute over the rights of a Norman abbey, Lyre Abbey, over churches it possessed in the diocese of Hereford, settling it by making the churches part of a prebend in Hereford Cathedral held by the abbot of Lire. Mapenor supported the new king Henry III in his efforts to suppress the rebellion begun under Henry's father, King John. Mapenor was with the forces of the king before the Battle of Lincoln in May 1217. The bishop was also present when the king and Llywelyn of Gwynedd, a Welsh prince, concluded a peace treaty at Worcester in March 1218. The king employed Mapenor in April as a diplomatic escort, ordering the bishop to bring some of the southern Welsh princes to Woodstock to swear fealty to Henry III. In June of that year, Mapenor attended the consecration of the new Worcester Cathedral. He was the recipient of one of a series of writs sent to bishops to stop the persecution of Jews. These writs may have resulted from a decision of the king's council to oppose some acts of the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215, which placed restrictions on Jews. Death Mapenor died in April 1219, probably on the 16th, although older sources give a date of the 13th.Gibbs Bishops and Reform p. 199 He had issued a charter as recently as 14 April 1219. He was buried in Hereford Cathedral. One of his surviving charters documents a licence given to Leominster Priory as alms for the souls of his parents and his predecessor as bishop, Giles de Braose.

Related somehow to his predecessor at Hereford, he served as a priest and papal judge as well as being an unsuccessful candidate as Bishop of St David's in Wales. In 1219, he was appointed Bishop of Hereford. During his time in office, he mostly attended to ecclesiastical duties, but did occasionally serve as a royal administrator. He helped found a hospital and a priory, and died in 1234 after a months-long illness. Early life Foliot possibly was the son of Roger Foliot and his wife Rohese.Barrow \\"Foliot, Hugh\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Roger held three knight's fees in Northamptonshire.Barrow Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 8: Bishops Probably born sometime between 1150 and 1160, Hugh was related in some manner to Robert Foliot, his predecessor at Hereford. He was a canon of Hereford Cathedral before becoming Archdeacon of Shropshire by May 1186.Barrow Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 8: Archdeacons of Shropshire Foliot is a frequent witness on charters as archdeacon, but little else is known of his tenure of the office. From 1212 to 1219, he served as a papal judge-delegate three times. In 1215 he was also King John's candidate for the see of St David's in Wales, but was not elected. After Foliot's failed candidacy as bishop, in February 1216 John appointed him to the benefice of Colwall in Herefordshire, the king having the ability to make the appointment because Giles de Braose, the Bishop of Hereford, who would normally have made the appointment, had recently died. Also from this time comes Foliot's patronage of Robert Grosseteste, the theologian and future Bishop of Lincoln. Bishop Foliot had been one of three members of the cathedral chapter from Hereford sent to King Henry III's court to secure permission for the chapter to hold an election in 1219 Foliot was elected to the see of Hereford in June 1219 and consecrated on 27 October 1219Fryde, et al.

Foliot spent most of his tenure of office in his diocese, only rarely attending the royal court or being assigned governmental duties. On 30 December 1223, Foliot assumed one of those duties, when he took custody of Hereford Castle after it was surrendered by Hubert de Burgh, during the redistribution of royal castles when de Burgh ousted des Roches from power.Prestwich Plantagenet England pp. 84‚Äì85 He also was appointed to determine the size of the royal forest in Gloucestershire. Foliot also founded a hospital in Ledbury, devoted to St Katherine. He helped found Alberbury Priory, a house of the Grandmontine order. In his cathedral, he reorganised the benefices and offices of the chapter, as well as endowing further benefices. Foliot died 7 August 1234, after an illness that began in the spring. He was buried in Hereford Cathedral, where his tomb survives. Foliot appointed his younger brother Thomas to offices in the diocese, first as precentor in the 1220s and then around 1230 as treasurer of the cathedral chapter.

The Hereford Cathedral records state that he was a friar the same length of time he was a bishop. He was buried in the friary church at Gloucester.

The gallery marketed art to the middle and upper-middle classes, first in the form of affordable prints and later in home furnishings and accessories, and played a significant role in the growth of art as an industry. Beginnings Associated American Artists was begun by Reeves Lewenthal. Lewenthal's first job was as a reporter for the Chicago Tribune but he quickly expanded into artists' agent, working as a publicist for British artist Douglas Chandor. By the 1930s Lewenthal had a clientele of 35 groups including the National Academy of Design and the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design. Realizing the limited possibilities in selling high-priced art to high-class dealers, and the correspondingly huge potential in marketing affordable art to the much larger middle classes, he left his public relations work to try his hand at this new business model. Prints being relatively cheap to produce, Lewenthal decided to focus on that medium. Before the 1930s, fine-art prints were usually limited editions which sold for $10‚Äì$50. During the Great Depression the Federal Art Project had resulted in hundreds of thousands of prints, but these were distributed free (mostly to schools) thus the artists made no profits from print sales. Lewenthal's idea was to combine quality, affordability, and profit. In 1934 he met with several well-known American artists, including Thomas Hart Benton, and proposed hiring them to produce lithographs which he would then sell to middle-class buyers for $5 apiece plus $2 per frame, paying the artist $200 per edition. At the same time, corporations began hiring famous artists to work on advertising campaigns ‚Äì Dole Pineapple, for example, hired artist Georgia O'Keeffe to \\"create pictorial links between pineapple juice and tropical romance\\".Doss, Erika. \\"Catering to Consumerism: Associated American Artists and the Marketing of Modern Art, 1934-1958.\\" Winterthur Portfolio, Vol. 26, No. 2/3. (Summer - Autumn, 1991), p. 144 This convergence of art, business, and consumerism was the perfect environment for Lewenthal's new Associated American Artists enterprise. When Lewenthal commissioned his first lithographs in 1934, the American economy was still limping towards recovery from the Depression; high- priced art was an impossible luxury for most people and the old galleries that had always supported artists were finding it difficult to broker their work. AAA was thus \\"an agent of economic salvation\\" for numerous American artists including Peggy Bacon, Aaron Bohrod, John Steuart Curry, Luigi Lucioni, and Grant Wood, despite the fact that signing with AAA usually meant being fired from their higher-end gallery. :I knew the regionalists were popular because their names were in the art magazines all the time. But they weren't popular enough, and they weren't making any money. Why, when I first went to Tom Benton's New York apartment he was living in utter squalor. I more or less rescued him.Doss, p. 154 By the fall of 1934 Lewenthal had contracts with fifty department stores to carry his \\"signed originals by America's great artists.\\" Doss, p. 149 Populist appeal Lewenthal marketed his prints as educational resources, as a patriotic choice, and as \\"art for the people\\" rather than \\"art for the wealthy.\\" In January 1935 AAA issued its first mail- order print catalogue; mail-order print sales will continue for the next forty-nine years. He also placed advertisements in magazines such as Time and Reader's Digest, and by promoting print collecting in terms of upward mobility‚Äîin the same way as buying Listerine (\\"The Dentifrice of the Rich,\\" according to one ad campaignDoss, p. 152), owning modern art raised one's life socially. AAA's success led them to open a 30,000-square-foot gallery at 711 Fifth Avenue in 1939 where they featured paintings and sculpture. In 1944, AAA had 107 artists under contract and sold 62,374 lithographs, for a net income of $1 million per month. In addition to its mainstream marketing strategy, AAA chose art and artists with populist appeal. Representational and regional art made up the bulk of their lines; particularly popular were the works of Benton, Curry and Wood. These artists avoided gritty realism and created positive images of an idealized, strong, capable America, a viewpoint which accorded well with the political environment of the New Deal and was in some senses therapeutic for the anxiety and weakness pervasive during and just after the Depression. Typical of this was Benton's Plowing It Under, released shortly after the federal government arranged the plowing under of millions of acres previously devoted to cotton production in order to increase farm revenue; Benton's work reassured the public that the government was working in the best interests of the people.Doss, p. 155 Commercialization of art The Regionalists by and large were in favor of businesses and advertising using their works, believing that fine art could raise the consciousness of business. They did not fully realize how art figured into corporate branding and advertising in the minds of corporate planners, or consider that their art might be used to inspire confidence in a product. They were soon to learn. Benton's original works for R.J. Reynolds' Lucky Strikes, for example, showed black sharecroppers at work, but corporate headquarters were not interested in \\"Negroes doing what looked like old-time slave work.\\" They demanded pictures that showed not realism but idealism, leading Benton to complain that \\"Every time a patron dictates to an artist what is to be done, he doesn't get any art, he just gets a poor commercial job.\\"Doss, pp. 158-159 Increasingly, rather than deal with AAA and its artists, companies built in-house art departments that could produce art in the Regionalist style. This appropriation of the regionalist/representational style culminated in the propaganda posters of World War II. Post-WWII The increasing association of regionalist and representational art with commercialism and advertising (and in some eyes, with fascism) contributed to its decreasing popularity and to the rise of abstract and surrealist art after World War II. When AAA opened galleries in Chicago and Beverly Hills, it stocked them with modern works by American and‚Äîa first for AAA‚ÄîEuropean artists. (When Lewenthal offered Jackson Pollock an art-for-business commission like those he had offered his artists in 1934, Pollock turned him down.) In its press releases and articles AAA talked about exploring \\"new frontiers,\\" \\"new trends\\" -- and made no mention of the $5 mail-order line and the artists who had helped it succeed twenty years earlier. Thomas Hart Benton resigned from AAA in 1946. AAA continued to find new ways to sell art, however, branching out into Stonelain porcelain, fabric, and housewares such as ashtrays, playing cards, and lamp shades as vehicles for work in abstract and other modern styles. By the mid-1950s, Lewenthal was quoted as saying, \\"Today's artist is a designer, not an Ivory Tower tenant. His is a field of practical creativity and every American room can become a showcase for his genius.\\".Article in House & Garden Now, rather than bringing modern art to the masses, AAA was bringing mass consumer commodities into the world of art. AAA was a victim of its own success in some ways. Having been so successful, it was adopted as a model by other companies that began to compete with AAA‚Äîmarketing fabric, for example, as \\"etching by the yard\\" or commissioning artists to do designs for lines of china or wallpaper. Steubenville China marketed its \\"American Modern\\" line of place settings as \\"art translated into dinnerware.\\" Doss, p. 166 In 1958 Lewenthal took over management of Rust Craft Greeting Cards, handling all AAA's decorative arts lines, while Sylvan Cole took responsibility for the New York gallery and the fine art market. In a strange reversal of its \\"market to the masses\\" philosophy, many early AAA prints which sold originally for $5 go to art collectors for thousands of dollars today.

He served as a royal justice and sheriff before being nominated to Hereford. He is sometimes credited with the legal treatise Britton; but in its current form Breton cannot be the author as the work refers to laws written 15 years after the bishop's death. Life Breton was the son of William le Breton, a royal justice. The elder Breton, who is sometimes styled William Brito in records, came from a family who often served as justices and other legal officials.Gibbs and Lang Bishops and Reform p. 192 Occasionally the younger Breton appears in the records as John Bretun or John Brito. He served as Sheriff of Herefordshire from 1254 to 1257, and then as constable and bailiff of Abergavenny around 1257. In October 1259 he was sent abroad on matters pertaining to King Henry III of England, and Henry's son, the future Edward I. He then served Edward as keeper of the prince's wardrobe and then after November 1261 as the prince's steward.Harding \\"Breton, John le\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography In late 1261 Breton is noted as owing ¬£120 in the royal records. A notation next to the debt implies that he was a canon of Hereford Cathedral at this point, but the Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300 does not identify him as such.Barrow Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 8: Hereford Breton does not appear in the records from this point until after the Battle of Evesham in 1265, when he is noted as holding a grant of royal safeguarding. Breton served as a royal justice from 1266, first in the Court of Common Pleas, and then at the King's Bench from 1268.Barrow Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 8: Hereford: Bishops He was elected to the see of Hereford around 6 January 1269. He was consecrated on 2 June 1269Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 250 at Waverley by Nicholas of Ely who was Bishop of Winchester. After his election and consecration, he no longer served as a royal justice. Breton was given leave to go to the continent to meet Edward when he returned from Crusade, in 1273, but the bishop did not attend Edward's coronation. Death and legacy Breton died on or before 12 May 1275, when the custodian of the bishopric was given orders to seize Breton's estate because of debts owed to the king. These debts dated back over 20 years, to his time as sheriff. A Thomas le Breton, presumably a relative, was a canon at Hereford Cathedral from 1273, and probably owed his office to John.Barrow Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 8: Hereford: Canons whose prebends cannot be identified A number of chronicles that mention Breton's death also note that he was the author of a legal treatise entitled le Bretoun, but this cannot be the surviving work called Britton, at least not in the current form, as that work discusses laws composed 15 years after Breton's death. It is unclear why he was credited with the work, and whether this attribution is just a confusion of Breton with the real author or if he did in fact author the work, which was later revised. The fact that the Britton is written in French, not Latin, and that it contains little information about the theory of law, being mostly concerned with the practical application of laws, points rather strongly to an author who was a royal justice, which Breton was.

He graduated doctor of divinity before holding a number of ecclesiastical offices, including that of Archdeacon of London. As a bishop, he dedicated considerable efforts to securing the canonisation of Thomas de Cantilupe, his predecessor, for whom he had worked during his lifetime. Active in his diocese, he devoted little time to politics. He was buried in Hereford Cathedral where a memorial to his memory still stands. Rise in the Church Swinefield's last name may come from Swingfield located near Folkestone, Kent. His father was Stephen of Swinfield, who died in 1282, and his brother Stephen remained a layman. No other information about his family and upbringing, including his date of birth, has emerged. He was a doctor of divinity degree, but where he graduated is not known.Hoskin \\"Swinfield, Richard\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography By 1264 Richard Swinefield was a member of the household of Thomas de Cantilupe, later to be made Bishop of Hereford in 1275. By 1279 Swinefield held the prebend of Hampton within the diocese,Barrow Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 8: Hereford: Bishops before 1279 and was to hold it until he became a bishop.Barrow Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 8: Hereford: Prebendaries: Hampton Shortly after 17 April 1280 he was named Archdeacon of London, having previously held an unknown prebend in the diocese of London.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 1: St. Paul's, London: Archdeacons of London Episcopate Richard Swinefield was elected to the see of Hereford, or bishopric, on 1 October 1282. The election was confirmed by John Peckham, the Archbishop of Canterbury on 31 December 1282, and he entered into possession of the spiritualities and temporalities, or the ecclesiastical and lay income producing properties, of the see by 8 January 1293.Coredon Dictionary of Medieval Terms & Phrases pp. 263, 271‚Äì272 He was consecrated on 7 March 1283. During Richard Swinefield's time as bishop, he was not involved in politics, and spent most of his time in his diocese. He rarely attended Parliament, usually excusing himself on the grounds of urgent diocesan business or his own bad health. He inherited a number of lawsuits from his predecessor, which he managed to settle. He also resolved a dispute over the boundary between the diocese of Hereford and the Welsh diocese of St Asaph, to the advantage of Hereford. In his disagreements with the town of Hereford, he was little inclined to give way and on one occasion threatened excommunication. Bishop Swinefield was concerned to ensure that his clergy were well treated. He worked to ensure that churches within his diocese were not misappropriated through the granting of custody to unworthy candidates, and was vigilant over monastic houses. His main efforts, though, went toward securing the canonisation of his predecessor Thomas de Cantilupe. This did not however take place until 1320, after Swinefield's death. Death and legacy Richard Swinefield died on 15 March 1317,Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 250 and was buried in Hereford Cathedral, where a memorial in the transept's north wall depicts him in bishop's robes and holding a building. Two of his nephews were given offices within the diocese, with John given the precentorship in Hereford Cathedral, and Gilbert made the chancellor there. Another possible relative was Richard Swinfield, who also held a prebend in the diocese. A record of Swinefield's expenses as bishop has survived for the years 1289 and 1290. The accounts offer a rare glimpse of the organisation and expenses of a major household at that period. During the 296 days covered by the record, his household moved 81 times, with 38 of these stops associated with him visiting his diocese during April through June.Moorman Church Life in England pp. 176‚Äì179 The record also shows that he supported two scholars at the University of Oxford.Moorman Church Life in England p. 205 The record has been edited a number of times, including by the Camden Society in 1853-1855.

The bottles are for aging the perfume (the skin breathes, allowing the water to evaporate while holding in the fragrance and oil, becoming a perfume, or attar.) Ittar, also known as attar, is an essential oil derived from botanical sources. Most commonly these oils are extracted via hydro or steam distillation. The Persian physician Ibn Sina, known as Avicenna in Europe, was first to derive the attar of flowers from distillation. Attar can also be expressed by chemical means but generally natural perfumes which qualify as ittars are distilled with water. The oils are generally distilled into a wood base such as sandalwood and then aged. The aging period can last from one to ten years depending on the botanicals used and the results desired. Technically ittars are distillates of flowers, herbs, spices and other natural materials such as baked soil over sandalwood oil/liquid paraffins using hydro distillation technique with deg and bhapka. These techniques are still in use today at Kannauj in India. History The word 'attar', 'ittar' or 'itra' believed to have been derived from the Persian word itir, meaning 'perfume', which is in turn derived from the Arabic word 'itr (ÿπÿ∑ÿ±). Attar is quite ancient in India; We find mentions of fragrance and perfume in the olden Indian epics and Granths. The kings would begin their day with fragrance. According to ‚ÄòAgni Purana‚Äô, they would take bath with over 150 varieties of fragrances. The consumption of fragrances was enormous in the harems of kings. As a large number of men and women were engaged in preparing fragrances amongst whom the woman numbered the most. These women were called Gandhkarika or Gandhhadika. These fragrances were known as Itra. The record of perfume-making in India can be found in the ‚ÄòBri- hat Samhita‚Äô, an encyclopaedia authored by the philosopher Varahamihi- ra ‚Äì a 6th-century Indian astronomer, mathematician, and an astrologer who lived in Ujjain. The earliest recorded mention of the techniques and methods used to produce essential oils is believed to be that of Ibn al-Baitar (1188‚Äì1248), an Al- Andalusian (Muslim-controlled Spain) physician, pharmacist and chemist. The Egyptians were famous for producing perfumes throughout the ancient world. They were formulated from plants and flowers before they could be added to other oils. It was later refined and developed by al-Shaykh al-Rais a renowned physician who made a distinctive type of aromatic product. He was referred to as Abi Ali al Sina. He was among the first people to come with the technique of distillation of roses and other plant fragrances. Liquid perfumes used to be a mixture of oil and crushed herbs until his discovery where he first experimented with roses. In Yemen, a special variety of Attar was introduced by Arwa al-Sulayhi, the Yemeni Queen. This type of Attar was prepared from mountainous flowers and given as a gift to the monarchs of Arabia. Abul Fazal Faizee gives another verdict of how Attar was used to making the Mabkhara- incense-burner. The barks that were used in Akbar's time according to Faizee were Aloe, Sandal, and Cinnamon. Animal substances such as Myrrh, Musk, and Anbar were used along with roots of special trees and a few other spices. The ruler of Awadh, Ghazi-ud-Din Haidar Shah used to prepare fountains of Attar around his bedroom. These fountains would create a very pleasant fragrant and romantic atmosphere by functioning continuously. Uses and types Ittars are generally classified based on their perceived effect on the body. 'Warm' ittars such as musk, amber and kesar (saffron) are used in winter, as they are believed to increase body temperature. Likewise, 'cool' ittars such as rose, jasmine, khus, kewda and mogra are used in summers for their perceived cooling effect on the body. Although ittars are mostly used as a perfume, they are also used for medicinal and aphrodisiacal purposes. Musk Musk is a class of aromatic compound produced by \\"Moschus moschiferus\\", a rare species of the male deer found in the Himalaya. The substance used in creating Musk can only be produced by a mature male Moschus, and the process of acquiring it involves killing the deer. As such, its demand has led to the endangerment of most musk deer species, which in turn has aided the rise of synthetic musk, known as 'white musk'. Natural musk is commonly mixed with medicines and confectionary. Purported medicinal benefits range from working as an antivenom and strengthening organs. Ambergris Ambergris, also known as Anbar, is a waxy substance excreted by the sperm whale and retrieved from beaches and the sea. It is thought to have been used by humans for at least 1,000 years, and has a musky aroma. Ambrein, an alcohol used as a scent preservative, is extracted from ambergris.https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/what-is-ambergris.html Spirituality & Religion For thousands of years, ittars were considered in some societies to be something that attracted angels and warded off evil spirits. Saints and spiritual aspirants would adorn themselves with these scents to assist them in their journey towards enlightenment. The different sects of Hinduism worship deities through household and temple offerings. Ittars are commonly used within the incense and food used as offerings.

Life Charleton was educated, it is said, at both Oxford and Cambridge, but was more closely connected with Oxford, of which he became a doctor of civil law and a licentiate, if not also a doctor, in theology. In 1336, he became prebendary of Hereford, of which see his kinsman Thomas Charlton was then bishop. He next appears, with his brother Humphrey, as holding prebends in the collegiate church of Pontesbury, of which Lord Charlton was patron. In 1340, Adam of Coverton petitione to the king against him on the ground of obstructing him in collecting tithes belonging to St. Michael's, Shrewsbury. A royal commission was appointed to inquire into the case, which in 1345 was still pending. Lewis had apparently succeeded Thomas the bishop to this prebend, and on his resignation in 1359 was succeeded by Humphrey, who held all three prebends in succession. In 1348, he appears as signing, as doctor of civil law, an indenture between the town and university of Oxford that the should have a common assize and assay of weights and measures. He was probably continuously resident as a teacher at Oxford; of which university his brother became chancellor some time before 1354. It is sometimes, but without authority, asserted that Lewis himself was chancellor. He constantly acted, however, in important business in conjunction with his brother. In 1354, a great feud broke out between town and university, and at the brothers‚Äô petition the king conditionally liberated some townsmen from prison and granted his protection for a year to the scholars. For these and other services they were enrolled in the album of benefactors, and in 1356 an annual mass for the two was directed to be henceforth celebrated on St. Edmund‚Äôs day. William of Wykeham is said to have been among Charlton‚Äôs pupils in mathematics.Walcott, M. E. C., William of Wykeham and His Colleges (London: D. Nutt, 1852), p. 7. Charlton‚Äôs Inn took its name from one of the brothers or from some others of the name about the same time connected with) the university. At last Lewis was raised by revision of Innocent VI to the bishopric of Hereford (1361), having already been elected by a part of the chapter, although the preference of another part for John Barnet, arch-deacon of London, had probably necessitated the reference to Avignon. Charlton was consecrated at Avignon on 3 October of the same year. Charleton was a Canon at Hereford Cathedral. He was nominated as Bishop of Hereford on 10 September 1361 and consecrated on 3 October 1361.Fryde, et al., Handbook of British Chronology, p. 250. Charleton's presence there rather suggests some mission or office at the papal Curia. On 3 November, he made the profession of obedience and received his spiritualities of Archbishop Simon Islip at Oxford, and on 14 November his temporalities were restored. Little is recorded of his acts as bishop. His attention to his parliamentary duties is shown by his appearing as trier, of petitions in 1362, 1363, 1365, 1366, and 1368. Charleton died on 23 May 1369, and was buried in the south-east transept of his cathedral, where his mutilated monument still remains. He left by his will his mitre and some vestments, together with ¬£40, to the cathedral. Family Lewis de Charleton's brother Humphrey de Cherlton was the Chancellor of Oxford University from 1354‚Äì7.

At least nineteen gunsmiths are known to have made weapons following the Kalthoff design. Some early Kalthoff guns were wheellocks, but the rest were flintlocks. The capacity varied between 5 and 30 rounds, depending on the style of the magazines. A single forward and back movement of the trigger guard, which could be done in 1‚Äì2 seconds, readied the weapon for firing. The caliber of Kalthoff guns generally varied between 0.4 and 0.8 inches, though .3 caliber examples also exist.  Origin and Production  The Kalthoff system originates with a gun which was crafted in Solingen by an unknown member of the Kalthoff family around 1630. Members of the family later moved to other areas of Europe, including Denmark, France, The Netherlands, England and Russia. The first patent for the Kalthoff system was issued in France by Louis XIII to Guillaume Kalthoff in 1640. This patent specified muskets and pistols that were capable of firing 8-10 shots with a single loading, while retaining the weight, length and handing of a standard firearm. A year later in 1641, Peter Kalthoff obtained a Dutch patent for a rifle which could fire 29 rounds before reloading. This patent did not specify the mechanism by which the gun worked, but mentioned that he would be able to perfect the design within a year. Later that year, another Dutch patent was granted to an individual named Hendrick Bartmans. This patent specified a gun with separate magazines for powder and ball, a 30 shot capacity, and a trigger guard that could be rotated to reload the weapon. Bartmans made a magazine rifle following his patent around 1642, which likely used a snaplock, though it is now missing from the gun. In 1645 Peter Kalthoff made a wheellock magazine rifle. This weapon is engraved with the text \\"Das Erste\\" (the first). He made another repeating firearm in 1646, a wheellock which functioned in much the same way his previous weapon did. This weapon carries an inscription on the barrel just in front of the breech, which asserts a 30 round capacity. That year he also made a repeating flintlock, which was given to the Danish Prince Frederik. The weapon was constructed in Flensburg, and was the first flintlock weapon to be made in Germany. Most repeaters made by Peter use a smooth, rounded trigger guard held in place by a rear trigger. Repeaters made by Matthias Kalthoff, who also worked in Denmark, have an initially straight trigger guard with a right angle formed by the carrier. They do not have a release trigger, and use a straight rod for retention of the lever. Guns by Mathias carry dates ranging from 1650 to 1679. Karl XI In 1649, a pair of repeating pistols made by a gunsmith with the surname Kalthoff were reported to have been sent to King Frederik III. Two pistols using the Kalthoff system are held at the National Museum of Denmark, but it can not be confirmed that these are the pistols mentioned. In Germany, wheellock repeaters were made by an individual referred to as the 'Master of Gottorp' (who was likely a gunsmith named Heinrich Habrecht). Two wheellock magazine guns, made circa 1645 and 1650 respectively, are attributed to Habrecht. These guns use a different breech system; the breech is quarter- cylindrical, and rotates at an axis parallel to the bore. This breech had one or two chambers. A later gun by Dutch gunmaker Alexander Hartingk, uses a similar breech. This gun was made circa 1670 for Karl XI. Hartingk's weapon uses a second powder magazine that sits to the right of the barrel, and primes the pan. center A Kalthoff gun engraved with the year 1652 carries the name Cornelius Coster Utrecht. This weapon has two ball magazines, one in the fore- stock and one in the butt (in addition to a powder magazine). A cylindrical tube behind the breech block holds a strong coil spring, which pushes against the breech block. Caspar Kalthoff made a flintlock repeating gun in London between the years 1654 and 1665. This gun used a rotating breech, and was later repaired by Ezekiel Baker in 1818. An identical gun by Caspar also resides in the T√∏jhusmuseet. In 1658, Caspar made a repeating rifle that featured a sliding box-breech and had a capacity of 7 rounds. Harman Barnes also made magazine guns in London, one of his guns used a rectangular sliding breech block with two chambers (and had a capacity of 5), another used a cylinder breech system (and had a capacity of 6). The latter gun was likely made around 1650, though it is unlikely it was completed before 1651. This gun shares many features found on one of one of Hendrick Bartmans' guns. It is possible the gun was simply imported from Holland and signed by Barnes, and was not crafted by him. Kalthoff guns using cylindrical breeches were also made by Jan Flock of Utrecht, some of which he advertised for sale in 1668. The price per weapon was at least 260 fl. Caspar Kalthoff the younger, the son of Caspar Kalthoff, made repeating weapons in Russia. He arrived in Russia between 1664 and 1665, and made a repeating firearm there in 1665. Hans Boringholm, a pupil of Mathias Kalthoff, made repeating guns for hunting use. Two repeating rifles attributed to Boringholm, dated 1670 and 1671, currently reside in the National Museum of Denmark. Anders Mortensen, a pupil of Boringholm, also made repeating firearms. On a Kalthoff gun signed By Mortensen, the powder passage is a separate component rather than being part of the lock. Around 1710, Charles Cousin made a gun using the Kalthoff system. This weapon had a capacity of 15, and was made in France. Mechanics and Operation left left There were two major variations of the Kalthoff repeater. The first used a rectangular breech block with two or three chambers, a powder magazine in the stock, and had a capacity of up to 30 rounds. At least one gun of this type also featured a coil spring behind the breech block which served to close the gap between it and the barrel. The second variation used a vertical cylindrical breech block, stored powder beneath the lock, and had a capacity of up to 10 shots. These guns had a removable cap over the breech, allowing the breech to be easily cleaned. An additional variation of the Kalthoff used a cylindrical breech that rotated on an axis parallel to the bore. The ball magazine was situated in a cylindrical cavity in the stock under the barrel. Many Kalthoff guns used a magazine located in the ramrod cavity, and featured a cap designed to look like the end of the ramrod. This style of magazine was around a meter in length and could hold over 60 14mm balls. However, when fully loaded the balls amounted to about a kilogram of weight, which changed the weapon's center of gravity. Guns of the rectangular breech type had a flat spring that would bend to the right as the breech was moved, which held the balls in the magazine as the breech moved to the right. Powder in the magazine could be reloaded through a hatch on the underside of the powder carrier if the powder magazine was located under the lock. On Kalthoff guns with the magazine in the stock, the magazine was refilled through a hole covered by a sliding lid in the butt-plate, or through a hole uncovered by removing a screw on the left side-plate. Some guns with a powder magazine in the butt also had a bolt inside the small of the stock, which could be turned to block the flow of powder. The carrier on most guns contained enough powder (5ccs on one example) for both the main charge and priming the pan. Spring-loaded covers on the carrier and powder magazine ensured that powder could only flow when the carrier aligned with the magazine or powder passage. The mechanism of many Kalthoff guns occupied the space normally reserved for a mainspring. This had to be worked around by placing it in the stock and connecting it to the cock using a rod, or by mounting it externally. alt= Two of Jan Flock's guns from below. The lower gun has two hatches; the left allows refilling of the powder magazine, and the right is the for ball magazine. The upper gun is missing the hatch for the ball magazine. With the muzzle facing upwards, laterally rotating the trigger guard approximately 155¬∞ to the right and back deposited a ball and load of powder in the breech and cocked the gun (or wound the wheel if the gun was a wheellock). On some guns a small trigger had to be depressed before rotating the trigger guard. A carrier attached to the trigger guard took the powder from the magazine to the breech, so there was no risk of an accidental ignition in the reserve. The trigger guard was either coupled to the cylindrical breech by a cross-pin, or moved the breech using a cogwheel. When the lever was rotated forwards fully, the carrier aligned with a hole at the front of the lock plate. The powder could then flow through a tunnel in the lock plate, and into the breech. The powder flowed directly through the breech into a cavity behind it in the case of cylinder breech guns, or into the middle chamber (or the rightmost one on two-hole variants) on rectangular breech guns. In the case of cylindrical breech guns, as the lever was rotated back, a loading arm on the left side of the gun seated a ball in the breech in front of the powder. On sliding breech block Kalthoff guns, a bullet would drop into the leftmost chamber as the gun was pointed upwards, and a plunger would seat the ball in the barrel as the left chamber aligned with the barrel. Cylinder breech guns still held some powder in the breech tap as the lever was rotated back; this powder would flow into the priming pan just as the ball was inserted. On rectangular breech guns, there would be remaining powder in the powder passage that would fall into the rightmost chamber as it shifted back towards the left, which then could flow into the pan. Alternatively, if the breech had only two chambers the powder would flow directly from the passage into the pan. Cocking the mechanism and closing the frizzen was achieved by a toothed bar that interfaced with a cogwheel attached to the lever. Use In 1648, after Frederik III succeeded his father, he ordered that the Scanian Guard be equipped with Kalthoff repeaters. This order was fulfilled by Peter and Mathias Kalthoff (and possibly a few other gunsmiths), and the guns were issued in 1657. The Guards received about a hundred guns (some of the surviving guns are numbered via an engraving on the stock, 108 and 110 being the highest), and they are thought to have been used in the Siege of Copenhagen (1658‚Äì59) and the Scanian War. By 1696 the guns had been removed from service. The Royal Armoury's inventory of 1775 still listed 133 repeating guns, by this time they were already regarded as antiques. A royal bodyguard of Charles X was equipped with Kalthoff repeaters in 1659.  Flaws  Despite having a remarkably fast fire rate for the time, the Kalthoff could never have become a standard military firearm because of its cost. The mechanism had to be assembled with skill and care, and took far more time to assemble than an ordinary muzzle-loader. Also, all the parts were interdependent; if a gear broke or jammed, the whole gun was unusable and only a specialist gunsmith could repair it. It needed special care; powder fouling, or even powder that was slightly wet, could clog it. Repeatedly firing the weapon created a buildup of powder fouling, making the lever increasingly hard to operate. Since it was so expensive to buy and maintain, only wealthy individuals and elite soldiers could afford it.  Derivatives   The Klett System  The Klett system was another system used for repeating firearms, and was an improvement on the Kalthoff system. The oldest date found on guns using the system is 1652. Klett repeaters also use a horizontally rotating trigger guard to operate the weapon. The Klett system features two rotating screw breeches, which function like the breech of the Ferguson Rifle. When the trigger guard is turned, the breeches descend and the rear cylinder collects powder from a magazine in the butt, and the front cylinder collects a ball from a magazine in the fore stock. A Klett carbine is described as firing \\"30 or 40 shots\\" in the memoirs of Prince Raimund Montecuccoli.  Repeating rifle signed Michal Dorttlo, 1683  A flintlock repeater, signed Michal Dorttlo 1683, uses many elements of the Kalthoff system. The breech is a vertically rotating cylinder, and the trigger guard can be rotated laterally to reload the weapon. However, it lacks the powder carrier found on Kalthoff guns, and instead houses both powder and ball in the butt. The gun uses a separate magazine for priming, but it is opened and closed manually.

It is located in the civil parish of Barcombe in the Lewes District. It is an important area for its wildlife, natural environment and water storage. The River Ouse and Andrew's Stream, one of its tributaries and popular for fishing, flow through the area and Barcombe Reservoir is adjacent. The area includes a small hamlet and some farms, including Barcombe House, and a water treatment works. There were mills in the parish of Barcombe as far back as the 11th century. Thomas and Denise Erith are recorded as holding a corn mill at the beginning of the 16th century. Although the original mills were destroyed by fire in 1939, several pillboxes from the Second World War, a beautiful large brick bridge and many weirs remain. The old road through the Mills features a former toll bridge which still displays its tolls in pre-decimalisation currency and a plaque mentioning that it was featured in the Domesday Book commissioned by William I. The local pub is the Anchor Inn, where canoes can be hired for trips down the Ouse. This public house, however, is situated about a kilometre to the north of the main hamlet and cannot be accessed directly by road from Barcombe Mills. It can be accessed along the disused trackbed of the railway or by walking over footpaths. It can also be reached by car by driving into the village of Barcombe Cross and turning right; it is then signposted down the dead-end Anchor Lane. The pub's address is in Barcombe Mills but it is generally considered as an offshoot of Barcombe Cross or Spithurst. The disused Barcombe Mills railway station served the village until 1969. Now just a collection of houses and a water treatment works, the area once had a thriving community. A pub called the Anglers' Rest (formerly known as the Railway Inn) closed in the 1990s. This was situated next to the former railway station. A restaurant was also present in the former railway station and this closed soon after the pub. Many more houses were also present at one time when the oil mills and the button factory still existed on the banks of the Ouse. The tributaries, weirs and millstreams cut to feed this are still obvious today - this is why the river takes such a bizarre course at Barcombe Mills. The hamlet is signposted from the village of Barcombe Cross but from nowhere else. In early 2018 two village signs were erected along Barcombe Mills Road, one at either side of the hamlet. Since it has lost many of its services it has reduced to a quiet backwater consisting of houses, farms and the Bob Davis Scout Hut which is used by the 1st Barcombe Scout Group in the summer months.  Flooding  Barcombe Mills is at the River Ouse's tidal limit and is also on its flood plain. The fields around Barcombe Mills sometimes flood in winter, occasionally closing the road which bypasses the hamlet. A few of the hamlet's lower-lying houses were damaged by water when the Ouse in Lewes flooded in October 2000, described as a \\"once in a hundred years\\" event. The area is known to have been subject to flooding since Roman times.  Tourism  The area is extremely popular with visitors in the summer who come to enjoy the beautiful riverside scenery on foot or by bicycle. There are numerous footpaths and a permissive bridleway along the disused trackbed of the railway to Anchor Lane. Many people enjoy walking, picnicking and swimming in the river in the summer months. Self-catering accommodation is available in the converted down waiting room of the former railway station.  Fishing  The River Ouse is extremely popular with anglers for its carp, pike, trout and other species of popular fish. There are long stretches of river interspersed with many pools which make for high quality fishing. The Ouse Angling Preservation Society and Isfield Angling Club hold rights to the river with Isfield leasing out their stretch to the Lewes Angling Club also. The river is also home to trout and migratory sea trout are seeing an increase. Andrew's Stream and the pool underneath the automatic sluice gates are popular with trout fisherman. Pike are also prevalent along with high quality carp and other species such as roach, rudd and foreign pumpkinseed and grass carp. The vast Barcombe Reservoir used by South East Water's water treatment works to extract water for drinking is also popular with fly fishermen fishing for trout. The fact that the water is extracted for drinking shows the clean quality of the Ouse's waters.  Local wildlife  Local bird and mammal species include: moorhen, mallard, mute swan, greylag goose, rabbit, barnacle goose, Canada goose, robin, blue tit, herring gull, sheep, cattle and grey wagtail. Most of the geese nest in the fenced off reservoir area. Rare freshwater mussels are also to be found in the quieter drains and streams that are in confluence with the Ouse.  Transport  The hamlet features the disused Barcombe Mills railway station which was on the former Lewes-Uckfield line. There is strong support for the re-opening of the line by the Wealden Line Campaign. The campaign has featured much prominence at national level , however a study by Network Rail considered the reopening technically but not economically feasible. However the group and local politicians are still campaigning. The nearest open station is at Lewes. The nearest port is Newhaven, East Sussex and the nearest airport is at Shoreham. This airport sees mainly private planes and a few light flights to France and the Channel Islands. The nearest major airport is London's Gatwick Airport near Crawley. The settlement lies along Barcombe Mills Road which leads north into the village of Barcombe Cross, giving access to the A275 and north to Newick and south to the A26. The hamlet sees three buses a day into Lewes (one in the morning, two in the afternoon) and three return journeys in the afternoon and the evening on the 125 service operated by Compass Travel. The 125 only operates to Barcombe Mills on weekdays only.

Comazon began his career as an ordinary army recruit under the Emperor Commodus, whom he served as a soldier in the province of Thrace. While there he suffered a demotion from the provincial government under Tiberius Claudius Attalus Paterculianus. However, this incident did not permanently affect his military career. In the year 218 he commanded the Legio II Parthica, which was temporarily stationed in Apamea in Syria. Upon the accession of Macrinus as emperor in 217, Comazon orchestrated a revolt among the Third Legion to help secure the throne for Elagabalus, who was tied to the Severan dynasty. Comazon was later rewarded with various important offices in the Empire, including prefect of Elagabalus' bodyguard, known as the Praetorian Guard, consul in 220 and an unprecedented three terms as City prefect in 220, 221 and 222. Elagabalus proved to be a highly unpopular ruler, and after barely four years in office, he was murdered by members of the Praetorian Guard who proclaimed his cousin Alexander Severus emperor in his place. However Comazon survived the overthrow and under the new Emperor again assumed the office of city prefect. It can be concluded that he retired after the conclusion of his tenure, but his date of death is not known. References * Paul M. M.

AHP structures a decision problem into a hierarchy with a goal, decision criteria, and alternatives, while the ANP structures it as a network. Both then use a system of pairwise comparisons to measure the weights of the components of the structure, and finally to rank the alternatives in the decision. Hierarchy vs. network In the AHP, each element in the hierarchy is considered to be independent of all the others‚Äîthe decision criteria are considered to be independent of one another, and the alternatives are considered to be independent of the decision criteria and of each other. But in many real-world cases, there is interdependence among the items and the alternatives. ANP does not require independence among elements, so it can be used as an effective tool in these cases. To illustrate this, consider a simple decision about buying an automobile. The decision maker may want to decide among several moderately-priced full-size sedans. He might choose to base his decision on only three factors: purchase price, safety, and comfort. Both the AHP and ANP would provide useful frameworks to use in making his decision. The AHP would assume that purchase price, safety, and comfort are independent of one another, and would evaluate each of the sedans independently on those criteria. The ANP would allow consideration of the interdependence of price, safety, and comfort. If one could get more safety or comfort by paying more for the automobile (or less by paying less), the ANP could take that into account. Similarly, the ANP could allow the decision criteria to be affected by the traits of the cars under consideration. If, for example, all the cars are very, very safe, the importance of safety as a decision criterion could appropriately be reduced. Literature and community Academic articles about ANP appear in journals dealing with the decision sciences, and several books have been written on the subject. There are numerous practical applications of ANP, many of them involving complex decisions about benefits (B), opportunities (O), costs (C) and risks (R). Studying these applications can be very useful in understanding the complexities of the ANP. The literature contains hundreds of elaborately worked out examples of the process, developed by executives, managers, engineers, MBA and Ph.D. students and others from many countries.In 2005, one book cited examples from the United States, Brazil, Chile, Czech Republic, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Korea, Poland, Russia, Spain, Taiwan, and Turkey. About a hundred such uses are illustrated and discussed in The Encyclicon, a dictionary of decisions with dependence and feedback. Academics and practitioners meet biennially at the International Symposium on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (ISAHP), which, despite its name, devotes considerable attention to the ANP. Outline of the steps Understanding of the ANP is best achieved by using ANP software to work with previously-completed decisions. One of the field's standard texts gives this outline of the steps involved: #Make sure that you understand the decision problem in detail, including its objectives, criteria and subcriteria, actors and their objectives and the possible outcomes of that decision. Give details of influences that determine how that decision may come out. #Determine the control criteria and subcriteria in the four control hierarchies one each for the benefits, opportunities, costs and risks of that decision and obtain their priorities from paired comparison matrices. You may use the same control criteria and perhaps subcriteria for all of the four merits. If a control criterion or subcriterion has a global priority of 3% or less, you may consider carefully eliminating it from further consideration. The software automatically deals only with those criteria or subcriteria that have subnets under them. For benefits and opportunities, ask what gives the most benefits or presents the greatest opportunity to influence fulfillment of that control criterion. For costs and risks, ask what incurs the most cost or faces the greatest risk. Sometimes (very rarely), the comparisons are made simply in terms of benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks by aggregating all the criteria of each BOCR into their merit. #Determine a complete set of network clusters (components) and their elements that are relevant to each and every control criterion. To better organize the development of the model as well as you can, number and arrange the clusters and their elements in a convenient way (perhaps in a column). Use the identical label to represent the same cluster and the same elements for all the control criteria. #For each control criterion or subcriterion, determine the appropriate subset of clusters of the comprehensive set with their elements and connect them according to their outer and inner dependence influences. An arrow is drawn from a cluster to any cluster whose elements influence it. #Determine the approach you want to follow in the analysis of each cluster or element, influencing (the suggested approach) other clusters and elements with respect to a criterion, or being influenced by other clusters and elements. The sense (being influenced or influencing) must apply to all the criteria for the four control hierarchies for the entire decision. #For each control criterion, construct the supermatrix by laying out the clusters in the order they are numbered and all the elements in each cluster both vertically on the left and horizontally at the top. Enter in the appropriate position the priorities derived from the paired comparisons as subcolumns of the corresponding column of the supermatrix. #Perform paired comparisons on the elements within the clusters themselves according to their influence on each element in another cluster they are connected to (outer dependence) or on elements in their own cluster (inner dependence). In making comparisons, you must always have a criterion in mind. Comparisons of elements according to which element influences a third element more and how strongly more than another element it is compared with are made with a control criterion or subcriterion of the control hierarchy in mind. #Perform paired comparisons on the clusters as they influence each cluster to which they are connected with respect to the given control criterion. The derived weights are used to weight the elements of the corresponding column blocks of the supermatrix. Assign a zero when there is no influence. Thus obtain the weighted column stochastic supermatrix. #Compute the limit priorities of the stochastic supermatrix according to whether it is irreducible (primitive or imprimitive [cyclic]) or it is reducible with one being a simple or a multiple root and whether the system is cyclic or not. Two kinds of outcomes are possible. In the first, all the columns of the matrix are identical and each gives the relative priorities of the elements from which the priorities of the elements in each cluster are normalized to one. In the second, the limit cycles in blocks and the different limits are summed and averaged and again normalized to one for each cluster. Although the priority vectors are entered in the supermatrix in normalized form, the limit priorities are put in idealized form because the control criteria do not depend on the alternatives. #Synthesize the limiting priorities by weighting each idealized limit vector by the weight of its control criterion and adding the resulting vectors for each of the four merits: Benefits (B), Opportunities (O), Costs (C) and Risks (R). There are now four vectors, one for each of the four merits. An answer involving ratio values of the merits is obtained by forming the ratio BiOi / CiRi for alternative i from each of the four vectors. The synthesized ideals for all the control criteria under each merit may result in an ideal whose priority is less than one for that merit. Only an alternative that is ideal for all the control criteria under a merit receives the value one after synthesis for that merit. The alternative with the largest ratio is chosen for some decisions. Companies and individuals with limited resources often prefer this type of synthesis. #Determine strategic criteria and their priorities to rate the top ranked (ideal) alternative for each of the four merits one at a time. Normalize the four ratings thus obtained and use them to calculate the overall synthesis of the four vectors. For each alternative, subtract the sum of the weighted costs and risks from the sum of the weighted benefits and opportunities. #Perform sensitivity analysis on the final outcome. Sensitivity analysis is concerned with ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù kinds of questions to see if the final answer is stable to changes in the inputs, whether judgments or priorities. Of special interest is to see if these changes change the order of the alternatives. How significant the change is can be measured with the Compatibility Index of the original outcome and each new outcome.

He was born and raised in Virginia. He served as a United States Attorney in Iowa when it was part of the Michigan and Wisconsin territories, and then represented the Iowa Territory in the United States House of Representatives. He later immigrated to the Oregon Country, where he served in the Oregon Territorial Legislature. After settling in Portland, he helped to found The Oregonian newspaper and promoted economic interests in the city. He also was involved with building Canyon Road near Portland, and fought in the Rogue River War in Oregon. In later years, he served in the Oregon Legislative Assembly and promoted the expansion of railroads from Portland. Chapman Square, a park in downtown Portland, is named for him and was built on land he sold to the city. Early life William Chapman was born in Clarksburg, Virginia, (now West Virginia) on August 11, 1808.Corning, Howard M. (1989). Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing. p. 51. His father died when William was fourteen, at which time he left home to earn his own way.Colmer, Montagu, and Charles Erskine Scott Wood. 1910. History of the Bench and Bar of Oregon. Portland, Or: Historical Pub. Co. pp. 263‚Äì264. He was educated in the public schools, and then took a job as a court clerk, while studying law on his own time. In 1832, after reading law, he earned his law license and began practice in Middletown. Chapman married Margaret F. Ingraham in 1832, and had seven children with her. They moved to Macomb, Illinois in 1833, then to what is now Burlington, Iowa (then part of Michigan Territory) in 1835, where they were among the first settlers. The next year he became a prosecuting attorney, and was then appointed by United States President Andrew Jackson as United States Attorney for the Michigan Territory. Iowa In 1836, the Wisconsin Territory was formed from the western section of the Michigan Territory. Chapman became the first U.S. Attorney for this new territory when it was created.William Williams Chapman. Biographical Directory of the United States Congress. Retrieved February 15, 2008. He was elected as colonel of the militia in 1836 after moving to what is now Dubuque, Iowa. Then in 1838, the Iowa Territory was carved from the Wisconsin Territory. Chapman was elected as Iowa Territory's first non-voting delegate to the United States House of Representatives. A Democrat, he served from September 10, 1838, to October 27, 1840, spanning portions of the Twenty- fifth and Twenty-sixth Congresses. While in Congress he introduced legislation for a pre-emption law, the first to do so in Congress. His efforts secured for Iowa the land grant of for the support of common schools, and a congressional report on Iowa's boundary dispute with Missouri that was favorable to Iowa.Benjamin F. Gue, \\"History of Iowa From the Earliest Times to the Beginning of the Twentieth Century,\\" Vol. 4 (William W. Chapman), pp. 46‚Äì47 (1902). After his term expired, Chapman returned to Iowa, relocating in 1843 to Agency City in Wapello County. In 1844, he served as a delegate to Iowa's Constitutional Convention, which was held in Iowa City and led to the entry of Iowa into the Union as the 29th state in 1846. Chapman left Iowa in 1847, traveling the Oregon Trail to the Oregon Country. Oregon He left in May and arrived in November of what was still the unorganized Oregon Country. At this time the region was under the jurisdiction of the United States after the settling of the Oregon boundary dispute with Great Britain the previous year. In Oregon, Chapman settled first in what was then Marysville, and is now Corvallis, in the Willamette Valley. In 1848, he relocated to Salem, where he learned of the California Gold Rush while at court at Knox Butte. Chapman went to California for a brief time and had some success in the gold fields before returning in 1849 to Oregon, which had become the Oregon Territory in 1848. He accompanied Joseph Lane, the newly appointed governor of the territory, on his return trip to Oregon. Chapman was elected to the first session of the Oregon Territorial Legislature later in 1849, representing Champoeg County (now Marion) in the legislature's lower house.Oregon Legislative Assembly (1st Territorial) 1849 Regular Session. Oregon State Archives. Retrieved on February 15, 2008. After the legislature finished its session, he moved to Oregon City and then Portland, both downstream of Salem on the Willamette River. Later in 1849, he took a trip to San Francisco, California, where he recruited Thomas J. Dryer to move to Portland and start a newspaper. He also purchased The Gold Hunter newspaper and moved the assets of the paper to Portland. In 1850, The Oregonian began publishing as a weekly newspaper in Portland. Dryer served as the publisher with Chapman as a co-founder. Chapman gave the paper its name. The assets of The Gold Hunter were used to start the paper. Chapman purchased land in Portland from Stephen Coffin and Daniel H. Lownsdale in 1850, which he then cleared and built a home. This is now the site of the Multnomah County Courthouse.Leeson, Fred. 1998. Rose City Justice: A Legal History of Portland, Oregon. Oregon Historical Society Press. pp. 7‚Äì10, 36‚Äì37. In Portland, he was a promoter of the city and helped to get Canyon Road built to ensure the city would become the commercial center of Oregon. Chapman practiced law, and in October 1851 he was held in contempt of court by Oregon Supreme Court justice Orville C. Pratt. Chapman was ordered to be sent to jail in the county seat of Hillsboro for 20 days and disbarred, but never went to jail and the order was revoked when Pratt was replaced on the court by justice Thomas Nelson. Chapman had accused Pratt of mistreating lawyers in an affidavit. Chapman left Portland in 1853 for Fort Umpqua in Southern Oregon. There he engaged in cattle ranching while keeping his Portland law practice. He served as a lieutenant colonel in the militia during the Rogue River War that was fought from 1855 to 1856 against the Native Americans in Southern Oregon. After the war he returned to Corvallis in 1856 before moving to Eugene in 1857. Chapman was appointed as surveyor general of Oregon and served from 1857 to 1861 when he returned to Portland. He left this federal government position due to his opposition to the election of Abraham Lincoln as U.S. president. Oregon entered the Union as the 33rd state in 1859. Later years Upon returning to Portland he built a home at 12th and Jefferson streets in what is now Downtown Portland. Chapman then returned to the practice of law. He also worked to secure Portland's economic future by promoting the construction of the railroad line to California to link with the transcontinental rail line. From 1870 to 1876 he started three companies with the goal of creating a railroad connecting Portland to the Union Pacific's transcontinental railroad. Chapman's proposed line would have traveled through the Columbia River Gorge to The Dalles, Oregon, where it would then travel southeast to Salt Lake City, Utah, linking to the Union Pacific line. In 1868, he returned to the legislature, representing Multnomah County in the Oregon House of Representatives as a Democrat.Oregon Legislative Assembly (5th) 1868 Regular Session. Oregon State Archives. Retrieved on February 15, 2008. While in the legislature, he worked to get a $30,000 government subsidy to purchase and operate a large steam tugboat at the mouth of the Columbia River. This vessel was used to pilot ships across the Columbia Bar and thus improved maritime commerce for Portland. In 1870, he sold two blocks of land in downtown to the City of Portland, which would become the Plaza Blocks between Third and Fourth avenues at Main Street.Chapman Square. Portland Parks & Recreation. Retrieved on February 15, 2008. William Williams Chapman died in Portland on October 18, 1892, at the age of 84, and was buried at Lone Fir Cemetery in that city. Chapman School in Portland was named in his honor. Chapman Square, part of the Plaza Blocks parks with Lownsdale Square, is also named in his honor. The two blocks were purchased from Chapman for $1200. Lownsdale Square contains the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Soldier's Monument, erected after Harvey W. Scott wrote an editorial pleading for a monument to the war on June 18, 1899. The monument includes the statue of a soldier dressed for the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War sculpted by Douglas Tilden. While the granite base is inscribed with Roman numerals indicating 1904, the base was not received until October 1905, and the monument was not dedicated until May 30, 1906, Memorial Day. The final cost of the monument was $14,722, paid for by donations following Scott's plea. The monument also contains two howitzers, donated by Henry E. Dosch, which he found buried in the beach near Fort Sumter. Dosch noted the howitzers had been used by both sides in the American Civil War. There is also a drinking fountain in the square, Fountain for Company H, donated to the city by the Ladies Auxiliary of Company H (of the 2nd Oregon Volunteer Infantry Regiment). The fountain was a design of John H. Beaver, dedicated on September 2, 1914.

The Grace‚ÄìWalsh‚ÄìSzeg≈ë theorem is named in part after him. Early life He was born in Halewood, near Liverpool, the eldest of the six children of farmer William Grace and Elizabeth Hilton. He was educated at the village school and the Liverpool Institute. From there in 1892 he went up to Peterhouse, Cambridge to study mathematics. His nephew, his younger sister's son, was the animal geneticist, Alan Robertson FRS. Career He was made a Fellow of Peterhouse in 1897 and became a Lecturer of Mathematics at Peterhouse and Pembroke colleges. An example of his work was his 1902 paper on The Zeros of a Polynomial. In 1903 he collaborated with Alfred Young on their book Algebra of Invariants. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1908. He spent 1916‚Äì1917 as Visiting Professor in Lahore and deputised for Professor MacDonald at Aberdeen University during the latter part of the war. In 1922 a breakdown in health forced his retirement from academic life and he spent the next part of his life in Norfolk.

He was one of the founding members of the Destour party.  Early life  Abdelaziz Th√¢albi's father was a notary whose family moved to Tunis after the 1830 French occupation of Algeria. Th√¢albi studied at the University of Ez-Zitouna, where he became learned in Salafiyyah. After he graduated in 1895, Th√¢albi began publishing a religious journal, Sabil al- Rashid (\\"the proper path\\"). In 1897, journal was suspended by the French, and Th√¢albi left Tunisia, travelling in Libya, Egypt, and India. He spent at least two years in Egypt, allegedly moving with disciples of Jamal-al-Din al-Afghani and Muhammad Abduh. Returning to Tunis in 1901, he began to openly criticize maraboutism and advocate a rationalistic reading of the Quran. In 1904 he was taken to court, accused of cursing Abdul-Qadir Gilani and calling the Quran an \\"obsolete book out of step with the progress of our age\\". He was largely defended by the French newspapers and condemned by the Arabic ones, and was ultimately found guilty and sentenced to two months in prison. In 1905 Th√¢albi published L'esprit lib√©ral du Coran (\\"the liberal spirit of the Quran\\") with C√©sar Benattar (who had been his defense lawyer) and el-Hadi Sebai. It was pro-French, in contrast with Sabil al-Rashid and his later writings. It claimed that Th√¢albi made connections with the Young Tunisians, and became editor of their Arabic newspaper. He participated in their political activities until he was expelled from Tunisia in 1912 following the Tunis Tram Boycott.  Destour  After World War I, Th√¢albi returned to Tunisia and joined former Young Tunisians who requested a decrease of French control at the Paris Peace Conference. In 1920 he wrote La Tunisie martyre (\\"the martyr Tunisia\\"), a nationalist manifesto wherein he criticized the protectorate and advocated the restoration of the 1861 constitution, an elected assembly and independent judiciary, improved education, and better protection of civil rights. He was arrested and returned to Tunisia. In 1921 he led the foundation of the Destour political party based on the policies outlined in La Tunisie martyre. In 1922, France proposed minor reforms in response to Destour pressure, but Th√¢albi and the Destour rejected them. After the death of the ruler Muhammad V an-Nasir and the growing intolerance of the French authorities, Th√¢albi left the country.  Later years  After spending time in exile in Egypt, Iraq, and India, Th√¢albi returned to Tunisia in 1937. By then the Destour had fallen into minority and had been eclipsed by the Neo Destour, who rejected Th√¢albi's traditional values. He attempted to revive Destour with little success, and died in 1944.

Best known as the wrestling promoter of little big men, he is also credited for helping to create the Tulsa wrestling territory later used by the National Wrestling Alliance. Early life Sam Avey was born in Kingfisher, Oklahoma on February 5, 1895. Prior to wrestling, Avey was a merchant in the family grocery, located in Cherryvale, Kansas. While growing up in Cherryvale, the community‚Äôs most prominent sports celebrity was Billy Sandow.National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 280, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, Sandow was the manager of Ed ‚ÄúStrangler‚Äù Lewis, and Sandow was the catalyst for Avey‚Äôs interest in professional wrestling. Professional wrestling After serving in World War I, Avey returned to Cherryvale and was recruited by Sandow to embark upon a wrestling career. He started in wrestling by travelling as a referee. In his early years in wrestling, it was not uncommon that Avey was misspelled Avery. Later on, Avey was brought to Tulsa to promote the matches of Ed ‚ÄúStrangler‚Äù Lewis. At the time, Oklahoma was a breeding ground for potential wrestlers. One of the wrestlers who caught Avey‚Äôs eyes was Leroy McGuirk, a grappler from Oklahoma A&M.; McGuirk would eventually become a junior heavyweight champion, and wrestlers from all over the country came to Oklahoma. After McGuirk was injured in auto accident, Avey gave him points in the company and named him the matchmaker. In September 1950, both men were appointed to Executive Positions in the National Wrestling Alliance. McGuirk was appointed as Second Vice-President while Avey was named the Treasurer due to his banking background. Hockey and Avey's Coliseum Sam Avey had other interests outside of wrestling. He helped reorganize the American Hockey Association following World War II and owned the Tulsa Oilers hockey club in the 1940s. At the time, the Oilers were affiliated with the United States Hockey League. In 1942, he acquired the Tulsa Coliseum for $185,000, and it was known affectionately as Avey's Coliseum. It regularly hosted prestigious political events and sporting events, such as ice hockey, boxing, and wrestling matches. Avey also owned the radio station KAKC, and it broadcast from the Coliseum basement.National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 281, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, On September 20, 1952, the building was burned to the ground after it was struck by lightning. The building‚Äôs wooden roof accelerated the fire. In January 1958, Avey sold out the wrestling promotion to McGuirk. He left to concentrate on his role as senior vice president with the Farmers and Merchants State Bank. He was still linked to the NWA and remained as Treasurer until August 1960. Charitable Work Avey was the director of the Tulsa Chamber of Commerce, president of the Rotary Club and was involved in numerous charities. Said charities included the annual Milk Fund wrestling spectacular every March and a celebrated Christmas party for children. Part of Avey‚Äôs wrestling legacy is that he gave Tulsa a structured promotion, which McGuirk ran with great success. Avey died on August 9, 1962 the age of 67.

Of medieval origin, it was rebuilt to the designs of Sir Christopher Wren, following its destruction in the Great Fire of London in 1666. The 17th-century building was demolished in 1874. The medieval church The church, which is first recorded in 1119, was on the north side of Budge Row (which no longer exists), at the corner of Sise Lane in Cordwainer Ward. It was originally known as St Anthony's, or St Anthonine's. It was dedicated to Saint Anthony the Great. The church was \\"re-edified\\" at the expense of Sir Thomas Knowles (Mayor of London in 1399 and 1410) and his son, also called Thomas. Both were buried in the church. It seems to have been rebuilt again in 1513 by John Tate. It was repaired in 1616, at a cost of more than ¬£900, and in 1623 a richly decorated gallery was added, its front divided into 52 panels, each bearing a coat of arms. The church became noted for its early morning lectures, established in 1559, to announce which the bells would start to ring at 5 am. Rebuilding St Antholin's was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666, and rebuilt in 1678-84 by Sir Christopher Wren, at a cost of ¬£5,685, paid for from the coal tax, and from contributions. The parish was united with that of St John the Baptist upon Walbrook, which was not rebuilt. The new church was long and wide; the tower, to the top of its spire, was high. The exterior of the body of the church was plain in style, but the attached steeple was more unusual and elaborate:Newcourt describes it as having \\"a very curious spire on it, all of Free-stone\\". George Godwin, writing in the early 19th century said the tower and spire \\"although they might not be termed beautiful or pure, display great powers of invention, and are of pleasing proportions\\". The stone spire was octagonal in plan, divided into storeys by horizontal ribs, with circular ribs at the corners. There were openings at the base of the spire, and it was crowned with the head of a classical column of the Composite order. The ceiling of the new church was in the form of an oval dome, supported on eight columns standing on high plinths. Godwin noted that \\"the carpentry of the roof displays Wren's knowledge of constructive science, and may be studied with advantage.\\" There was a small gallery with an organ at the west end, and a circular window at the east end, above the altar. Nineteenth century The site of St Antholin's in 2008 In 1829, the upper part of the spire was replaced and the portion removed, with its dragon's head weathervane, was sold for ¬£5 to Robert Harrild, a printer, who had it erected on his property, Round Hill House in Sydenham, now London SE26. It remains there today, now surrounded by modern houses. The church was demolished in 1875 The London Encyclopaedia Hibbert,C;Weinreb,D;Keay,J: London, Pan Macmillan, 1983 (rev 1993,2008) under the Union of Benefices ActOf all the churches demolished in the nineteenth century, the loss of St Antholin's seems to have caused the greatest regret: cf Gordon Huelin, Vanished Churches of the City of London, p.35. London, Guildhall Library Publications, 1996 to make way for the development of Queen Victoria Street. At this time many bodies were disinterred from the crypt and reburied at Brookwood Cemetery. The parish was then joined to that of St Mary Aldermary. St Antholin's, Nunhead The proceeds from the sale of the site came to ¬£44,990. Some of this went towards the building of the new church of St Antholin in Nunhead, in Peckham, south London, to a design by Ewan Christian. The new building also received the City church's reredos. It was consecrated on 11 May 1878. It was gutted by incendiary bombs on 27 December 1940, but was rebuilt after the war, and reconsecrated on 12 October 1957, as St Anthony, Nunhead. In 1990 the parish was combined with that of St Silas, Peckham Rye. St Antholin‚Äôs was declared redundant in 2001 and sold to a Pentecostal congregation. In 2003 St Silas was demolished and rebuilt on the same site, with the dedication of St Antony and St Silas. Two bells, one made for the City church of St Antholin in 1717, and one recast in 1925 from the metal of another, were hung in the new tower.

It stars Dharmendra playing Swarn Kamal - a newly appointed Sanskrit professor in a girls' college. Hema Malini is a strict Chemistry lecturer (Phoolrenu) and warden of the same college.  Synopsis  Phoolrenu has been nicknamed \\"carbon dioxide\\" and Swarnkamal is lovingly called \\"jijaji\\" by the girls. While for Swarnkamal it is love at first sight, Phoolrenu detests him due to his style of teaching the works of Mahakavi (Great Poet) Kalidas. From the celebrations of the festival - Holi to the Annual function, all attempts of Swarnkamal to win over Phoolrenu seem to be having an opposite effect. He then visits Phoolrenu during the summer vacations at her hometown of Kashipur and finally makes some headway, but Phoolrenu wants him to approach her through a proper channel by responding to her matrimonial advertisement in a newspaper. But confusion reigns and Phoolrenu's marriage is fixed with someone else. Will Swarnkamal be able to make it to the wedding in time and clear the chaos. Watch this sublime comedy to find out.

Sometimes he negotiated with foreign rulers, such as Elizabeth I of England, but more often with domestic antagonists, such as Henry of Navarre and his Huguenots, Henry I, Duke of Guise, and the Catholic Leaguers, and Francis, Duke of Anjou and his allies in the Low Countries. In the course of these missions Bellievre corresponded copiously with Henry III, and Bellievre also discussed them with his ministerial colleagues, often stating frankly to colleagues his discomfort with King Henry's decisions.

He was a provincial legislator, national deputy, senator, Vice-President and ambassador. Life and times Perette was born in Paran√°, Entre R√≠os and was educated at the National University of the Littoral where he studied law. In his youth, he was a footballer who played in the first division at Estudiantes de Paran√°. His brother Francisco Perette would become President of the Argentine Football Association (AFA). Perette became involved with the Radical Party at a young age and in the late 1930s served first as President of the Youth Chapter of the Paran√° UCR, and later of Entre R√≠os Province's chapter. In 1943 he was elected to the Entre R√≠os legislature, in elections that were won by his party headed by Eduardo Laurencena who was elected governor. Laurencena was prevented from taking office, however, by military intervention. Perette was elected a provincial deputy once again in 1946, a leading opponent of Peronist governor Hector Maya. Following his re-election in 1950, Perette served as President of the UCR bloc in the legislature. In 1952 Perette was elected as a national deputy and headed the greatly reduced UCR bloc towards the end of the second term of President Juan Domingo Per√≥n. Perette was a leading 'unionist', the wing of his party which became the UCRP during the party's split ahead of the 1957 Constitutional Assembly elections. To Perette is attributed the Pueblo ('People') tag of the party, meant to differentiate from the opposing ideas of Arturo Frondizi. Returning to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies between 1958 and 1962, he was the Vice President of the UCRP bloc. In the subsequently annulled elections of 18 March 1962 Perette was decisively beaten for the governorship of his province by the UCRI ('Intransigent Radical') candidate. In 1963, Perette was elected Vice President of Argentina as the running mate for UCRP candidate Arturo Illia. Perette was an enthusiastic supporter of co-operatives and introduced legislation to support them. He played a decisive role in the construction of the Uranga-Begnis tunnel under the Paran√° River between the cities of Paran√° and Santa Fe, helping integrate the Argentine Mesopotamia into the rest of the nation upon its 1969 opening. Illia and Perette was removed during the coup of June 28, 1966. He continued to follow Ricardo Balb√≠n's style of Radicalism - the 'National Line' (L√≠nea Nacional) - within the reunited UCR. He was elected to the Argentine Senate in 1973 and headed the Radical bloc until 1976. Following the fall of the military government, Perette stood as the running mate of Fernando De La Rua on the National Line slate in the internal selections for the 1983 Presidential elections, but they eventually withdrew their candidacy. The eventually successful Radical President Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n named Perette Ambassador to Uruguay, serving between 1983 and 1989. He refused his vice-presidential and senatorial pensions in protest over the two coups that cut each of those terms short. Carlos Perette died in 1992.

It took place at the chapel of St Tears (St Tayre) on the coast north of Wick in Caithness, between Ackergill Tower and Girnigoe Castle. It was arranged to settle a dispute with a battle between twelve men on horseback on either side. However, the Keiths arrived with two men on each of their twelve horses, and massacred the 12 Gunns. The clans finally signed a treaty of friendship in 1978, ending the feud after 500 years. Background It is recorded that the feud began when Dugald, Chieftain of the Keiths, abducted Helen of Braemore, daughter of Lachlan Gunn, when he discovered that she was betrothed to Alexander Gunn. The attack occurred on the night before the wedding, and Alexander was one of those slain by the Keiths. Helen subsequently committed suicide by throwing herself off Ackergill Tower. Subsequent conflicts between the two clans were for the most part indecisive, and losses were numerous on both sides. After long quarreling between the Keiths and Gunns it was decided that a \\"battle of champions\\" would be fought between twelve men on horseback on either side but the Keiths arrived with two men on each horse. Battle Conflicts of the Clans An account of the battle was written in the book Conflicts of the Clans, published by the Foulis Press in 1764, written from a manuscript from the time of King James VI of Scotland (1566‚Äì1625): > About the year of God 1478, there was some dissention in Caithness betwixt > the Keiths and the Clan Gunn. A meeting was appointed for their > reconciliation, at the Chapel of St. Tayre, in Caithness, hard by Girnigo, > with twelve horse on either side. The Crowner (chieftain of Clan Gunn) with > the most part of his sons and chief kinsmen came to the chapel, to the > number of twelve; and, as they were within the chapel at their prayers, the > Laird of Inverugie and Ackergill arrived there with twelve horse, and two > men upon every horse; thinking it no breach of trust to come with twenty- > four men, seeing they had but twelve horses as was appointed. So the twenty- > four gentlemen rushed in at the door of the chapel, and invaded the Crowner > and his company unawares; who, nevertheless, made great resistance. In the > end eight the Clan Gunn were slain, with the most of the Keiths. Their blood > may be seen to this day upon the walls within the Chapel at St. Tyre, where > they were slain. Afterwards William Mackames (the Crowner's grandchild) in > revenge of his grandfather, killed George Keith of Ackergill and his son, > with ten of their men, at Drummuny in Sutherland, as they were travelling > from Inverugie into Caithness. Robert Mackay Robert Mackay wrote an account of the battle in his book the History of the House and Clan of the Name Mackay (1829), quoting from historian Sir Robert Gordon (1580‚Äì1656): > After long quarreling between the Keiths and Guns, it was agreed that riders > on twelve horses each side should meet at the Chapel of St Tayr, near > Ackergill, to adjust all their differences. At the time appointed the > chieften of the Guns with eleven men of his tribe attended; and as the > Keiths had not arrived, they employed the intermediate time in devotion. At > length the Keiths appeared on twelve horses, but with double riders on each, > and immediately set upon the Guns, and killed ever man of them, but with the > loss of the greater part of their own number. Sir Robert who relates to the > tragedy, says their blood was seen on the walls of the chapel in his > time.The chieften or coroner's son, James Gunn, then left Caithness with his > clan, and settled in Sutherland, where they became wardens of that district. > William, son of this James, and a number of his tribe, afterwards > intercepted George Keith of Ackergill, accompanied by his son and twelve of > their followers, on their journey from Inverguey to Caithness, and killed > them all in revenge of the above massacre. This William was surnamed > Mackamish, i.e. son of James; and thenceforward the chieften of the clan > Gunn has always been titled Mackamissh. Treaty ending the Keith/Gunn feud By the 1970s, with North American members of both clans on friendly terms, the feud between them was no longer an issue. At the urging of their clan members, the Chief of Clan Keith, Sir James Ian Keith, Earl of Kintore, and the Commander of Clan Gunn, Ian Alexander Gunn of Banniskirk, signed a \\"Bond and Covenant of Friendship\\" on 28 July 1978, at the site of St. Tears on the 500th anniversary of the battle there. The treaty has since been celebrated by some members of both clans at Highland games and other common gatherings.

It supports learning content management (including SCORM 2004 compliance) and tools for collaboration, communication, evaluation and assessment. The software is published under the GNU General Public License and can be run on any server that supports PHP and MySQL.  History  ILIAS is one of the first Learning Management Systems that have been used in universities. A prototype has been developed since end of 1997 within the VIRTUS project at the Faculty of Management, Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Cologne, initiated and organized by Wolfgang Leidhold. On November 2, 1998 version 1 of the learning management system ILIAS was published and offered for learning at the Cologne faculty of business administration, economics and social sciences. Due to increasing interest of other universities, the project team decided to publish ILIAS as open source software under the GPL in 2000. Between 2002 and 2004, a new ILIAS version was developed from scratch and called \\"ILIAS 3\\". In 2004, it became the first open source LMS that reached full SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference Model) 1.2 compliance. SCORM 2004 compliance has been reached with version 3.9 in November 2007.  ILIAS Concept  The idea behind ILIAS is to offer a flexible environment for learning and working online with integrated tools. ILIAS goes far beyond the idea of learning being confined to courses as a lot of other LMS do. ILIAS can rather be seen as a type of library providing learning and working materials and contents at any location of the repository. This offers the possibility to run ILIAS not as a locked warehouse but as an open knowledge platform where content might be made available for non-registered users too.  Features  ILIAS offers a lot of features to design and run online-courses, create learning content, offer assessments and exercises, run surveys and support communication and cooperation among users.  Personal Desktop  A general characteristic of ILIAS is the concept of Personal Desktop and Repository. While the Repository contains all content, courses and other materials structured in categories and described by metadata, the Personal Desktop is the individual workspace of each learner, author, tutor and administrator. The Personal Desktop contains selected items from the repository (e.g. currently visited courses or an interesting forum) as well as certain tools like mail, tagging, a calendar and also e-portfolio and personal blogs. * Listing of selected courses, groups and learning resources * Personal profile and settings like password and system language * Bookmark Management * Personal Notes * External Web Feeds * Internal News * Personal Workspace * Blogs * e-Portfolio * Calendar * Internal Mail * Personal Learning Progress  Learning Content Management  Another important characteristic of ILIAS is the repository. All learning content but also forums or chat rooms, tests and surveys, as well as plugged in virtual classrooms or other external tools are created, offered and administrated in the repository and its categories. Therefore, it is not necessary to build up courses for offering learning content. ILIAS could also be used like a kind of knowledge base or website. Access to all repository item is granted by the role-based access control (RBAC) of ILIAS. The repository is structured as tree with a root node and multiple levels. Each repository item is assigned to one node in the RBAC tree. ILIAS offers four kinds of container for delivering content: * Categories * Courses incl. member administration * Groups incl. member administration * Folders (within courses and groups) Container objects can be extended by using the page editor for adding text, images or videos to the page. All content objects are handled as references. They can be moved, copied or linked into other branches of the repository tree. A file that has already been uploaded can be linked multiple times in different courses and categories without being uploaded a second time.

Mutations in the fukutin gene have been shown to result in Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD) characterised by brain malformation - one of the most common autosomal-recessive disorders in Japan. In humans this protein is encoded by the FCMD gene (also named FKTN), located on chromosome 9q31. Human fukutin exhibits a length of 461 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 53.7 kDa.  Function  Although its function is mostly unknown, fukutin is a putative transmembrane protein that is ubiquitously expressed, although at higher levels in skeletal muscle, heart and brain. It is localized to the cis- Golgi compartment, where it may be involved in the glycosylation of Œ±-dystroglycan in skeletal muscle. The encoded protein is thought to be a glycosyltransferase and could play a role in brain development.  Clinical significance  Defects in this gene are a cause of Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS), limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2M (LGMD2M), and dilated cardiomyopathy type 1X (CMD1X).

Looking across Forbury Park and southern Saint Kilda from the west. The large white building in the upper right of the picture is Dunedin Ice Stadium, with Marlow Park immediately to its right. St Kilda is a suburb of the New Zealand city of Dunedin. A densely populated residential suburb, it lies on the southern part of the city's central plain, to the southwest of the head of the harbour and immediately north of Ocean Beach, parts of which (St Kilda Beach and Middle Beach) are within the suburb and form its major geographical feature. Saint Kilda's 2001 population was 5,904. The suburb has fairly well-defined boundaries, having been a separate borough from 1875 until the time of local government restructuring in 1989. This borough was bounded by Forbury Road in the west, Bay View Road in the north, and Royal Crescent in the east, and at the time of its amalgamation into Dunedin City, was the most densely populated borough in New Zealand. Much of the borough's growth was between 1900 and 1930, during which time the population rose from around 1500 to 8000, slowly declining from that time to its current figure.Aitken, H.J.A. (1975) St. Kilda: The first hundred years. Dunedin: John McIndoe. Many of St Kilda's houses date from this period. St Kilda was named for the Melbourne suburb by early property developer George Scott, who had arrived in New Zealand from Victoria in 1862. The area previously had the Maori name Whakaherekau. St Kilda gave its name to a New Zealand electoral constituency which covered much of southern Dunedin and the Otago Peninsula. This electorate existed from 1946 to 1993 (after which it was replaced by the new Dunedin South electorate), and was represented in turn by Fred Jones (Labour, 1946-1951), Sir James Barnes (National, 1951-1957), Bill Fraser, (Labour, 1957-1981), and Michael Cullen (Labour, 1981-1993). St Kilda is surrounded by the suburbs of St Clair, Forbury, Caversham, South Dunedin, Musselburgh and Tainui. Other major streets in St Kilda include Prince Albert Road in the east (which contains most of the suburb's few shops), Queens Drive, Richardson Street and Victoria Road, the last of which runs along the southern shore, separated from the Pacific Ocean by wide high dunes. The Sir James Barnes Lookout is located close to the highest point of the dunes and commands views across the plain on which Saint Kilda lies and the surrounding parts of the city. The streets of St Kilda form a grid pattern which is interrupted by a long crescent (Hargest Crescent), which runs around the original boundary of the city's main horse racing venue, Forbury Park (the park was reduced to its current size in 1909).Herd, J. and Griffiths, G. J. (1980) Discovering Dunedin. Dunedin: John McIndoe. The suburb also contains the Dunedin Ice Stadium, an Olympic-sized ice-skating rink and several sports fields, notably De Carle Park, Marlow Park, Kettle Park, and Hancock Park. Chisholm Park Golf Course also lies partly within Saint Kilda. Saint Kilda has three pubs, a bowling green, tennis courts, and a badminton hall. Though it contains no secondary schools, the paired single-sex King's and Queen's High Schools lie close to its northern edge. St Kilda is also the home of the St Kilda Sentinel Brass Band, Pirates Rugby Club, Otago Model Engineering Society, Ocean Beach Railway, St Kilda Surf Lifesaving Club, Hot Rod Club and Ocean Beach scout group. Being mainly residential, there are few notable industries within the suburb, an exception being Wests, a soft drink manufacturers located in Bay View Road.

It can be seen as either an emotional entity influencing individual members' emotional states (top down) or the sum of the individuals' emotional states (bottom up). Top down approach  This view sees the group's dynamic processes as responsible for an elusive feeling state which influences the members' feelings and behavior. This view, that groups have an existence as entities beyond the characters that comprise them, has several angles. Effects on individuals One angle of this approach was depicted in early works such as Le Bon's and Freud'sFreud, S. (1922/1959). Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego (trans. James Strachey). New York: W. W. Norton. who reasoned that there is a general influence of a crowd or group which makes the members of the group \\"feel, think and act\\" differently than they would have as isolated individuals. The reassurance of belonging to a crowd makes people act more extremely. Also, the intense uniformity of feelings is overwhelming and causes people to be emotionally swept to join the group's atmosphere. Thus, the effect of the group causes emotions to be exaggerated. Norms Another aspect of the group as a whole perspective sees the normative forces a group has on its members' emotional behavior such as norms for the amount of feelings' expression and even which emotions it is best to feel. The group's norms control which emotions would (or at least should) be displayed at a specific situation according to the group's best interest and goals. The norms help differentiate felt emotions, what the individuals actually feel, from expressed emotions, what they display in the current situation. This perspective has practical implications as shown by researchers. Thus, according to this angle the group causes the emotions to be moderated and controlled. Binding force Another perspective emphasizes the importance of emotional attraction in group settings. It defines group emotion as members' desire to be together, and finds that emotional ties are a type of glue which holds groups together and influences the group's cohesiveness and the commitment to the task. This perspective focuses on the positive emotions of liking the other group members and the task at hand. Indicator This perspective of the group as a whole approach studies the dynamic development of the group, from its establishment to its disassembly. Along the course the group changes in its interrelationships and interdependence amongst its members. These changes are accompanied by emotional processes which shape the outcome of the group. For instance, the midpoint in a group's development is characterized by anxiety and anticipation about the capacity of the team to complete its goals, which drives teams to restructure their interaction patterns following the midpoint. Should the group harness these feelings and overcome the crisis stronger, its chances of completing the group's goals are higher. In other cases, negative emotions towards members of the group or towards the task might jeopardize the group's existence. This perspective sees the temporal changes of the emotions that govern the group. Bottom up Contrary to the former approach, this approach views group-level emotion as the sum of its individuals' affective compositions. These affective compositions are actually the emotional features each member brings with him to the group, such as: dispositional affect, mood, acute emotions, emotional intelligence, and sentiments (affective evaluations of the group). The team affective composition approach helps to understand the group emotion and its origins, and how these individual members' affective predisposition combine to become one common entity. For the purpose of combining these individual characteristics, one can embrace several viewpoints: Average mood  Research has shown that by averaging the members' dispositional affective tone it is possible to predict group-level behavior such as absenteeism and prosocial behavior. Also, when the average mood of employees was positive, it was positively related to the team's performance. Emotional variance  Affective-homogenous groups are expected to behave differently from heterogeneous ones. The verdict is yet to be decided as to whether homogeneity is better than heterogeneity. In favor of affective homogeneity stand the notion that familiarity and similarity bring feelings of liking, comfort and positive emotions, and thus presumably better group outcomes and performances. It has long been found that people prefer to be in a group similar to them in many perspectives. A support for the positive effects of homogeneity can be found in a study that examined homogeneity in managers' positive affectivity (PA) and its influence on several aspects of performance such as satisfaction, cooperation and financial outcome of the organization. On the other hand, according to the view of opposites being beneficial, affective heterogeneity may lead to more emotional checks and balances which could then lead to better team performance. This was found to be true especially in groups where creativity is needed to complete the task appropriately. Homogeneity might lead to groupthink and hamper performance. It is necessary though for group members in heterogeneous groups to accept and allow one another to enact their different emotional roles. Emotionally extreme members Even if there is only one member in an otherwise averaged group which is extremely negative (or positive) in effect, that person might influence the affective state of the other members and cause the group to be much more negative (or positive) than would be expected from its mean-level dispositional affect. This mood shift might happen through emotional contagion, in which members are \\"infected\\" by others' emotions, as well as through other processes. Emotional contagion has been observed even in absence of non-verbal cues, for example on online social networks like Facebook and Twitter. Combining approaches The above approaches can be combined in a way that they maintain reciprocal relations. For instance, members bring dispositional affective states and norms for expressing them to the team. These components are then factors determining the creation of group norms, which may in turn alter the moods, feelings and their expression by the members. Thus, the top-down and bottom-up approaches coalesce along the dynamic formation and lifespan of teams. Empirical definition One study compared the reports of team members to reports of outside-observers. It showed that team affect and emotions were observable by and agreed upon by outsiders as well as by members of the team interacting face to face. So, it is possible to identify the group's affective tone by aggregating self-reports of members of the group, as well as by viewing the group from the outside and looking for emotional gestures, both verbal and nonverbal. Affecting group emotion Studies show that the leader of the team has an important part in determining the moods of his team's members. Such that members of a team with a leader in a negative affective state tend to be more negative themselves than members of teams with a leader in a positive mood. However, any member of the group might influence the other members' emotions. He may do so either by way of implicit, automatic, emotional contagion or by explicit, deliberate, emotional influence in order to promote his interests. Other factors that affect the forming of the group's emotional state are its emotional history, its norms for expressing feelings and the broader organizational norms regarding emotions. Influence on performance The emotional state of the group influences team processes and outcomes. For example, a group in a positive mood displays more coordination between members, yet sometimes the effort they apply is not as high as groups in a negative mood. Another role emotions play in group dynamics and performance is the relation between intra- group task-conflicts and relationship-conflicts. It is assumed that conflicts related to the task can be beneficial for achieving the goal, unless these task-conflicts lead to relationship-conflicts among the team members, in which case the performance is hindered. The traits that decouple task from relationship conflicts are emotional attributes such as emotional intelligence, intragroup relational ties, and norms for reducing or preventing negative emotionality. Hence aspects of group emotion affect the outcome. Other findings are that an increase in positive mood will lead to greater cooperativeness and less group conflict. Also, positive mood results in elevated perceptions of task performance. Evolutionary-psychological perspective According to the evolutionary psychology approach, group affect has a function of helping communication between members of the group. The emotional state of the group informs its members about factors in the environment. For instance, if everyone is in a bad mood it is necessary to change the conditions, or perhaps work harder to achieve the goal and improve the conditions. Also, shared affect in groups coordinates group activity through fostering group bonds and group loyalty. Emotional aperture Emotional aperture has been defined as the ability or skill to perceive features of group emotions.Sanchez-Burks, J. & Huy, Q. (2008) \\"Emotional Aperture: The Accurate Recognition of Collective Emotions.\\" Organization Science, pp. 1‚Äì13 Examples of features of group emotions include the level of variability of emotions among members (i.e., affective diversity), the proportion of positive or negative emotions, and the modal (i.e., most common) emotion present in a group. The term \\"emotional aperture\\" was first defined by the social psychologist, Jeffrey Sanchez-Burks and organizational theorist, Quy Huy. Analogous to adjusting a camera's aperture setting to increase depth of field, emotional aperture involves adjusting one's depth of field to bring into focus not solely the emotions of one person but also others scattered across a visual landscape. The difference between perceiving individual-level emotions versus group-level emotions is builds upon the distinction between analytic versus holistic perception.

Reserve-Division) was a unit of the Imperial German Army in World War I. The division was formed at the end of December 1914 and organized over the next month, arriving in the line in early February 1915.77\\\\. Reserve-Division (Chronik 1914-1918) It was part of the second large wave of new divisions formed at the outset of World War I, which were numbered the 75th through 82nd Reserve Divisions.This wave also included the 8th Bavarian Reserve Division. Between the first wave (42nd through 54th Reserve Divisions and 6th Bavarian Reserve Division), several other divisions were formed on ad hoc basis, mostly taking the name of their commander or place of formation, but these were not part of a planned formal wave of new divisions. The division was initially part of XXXIX Reserve Corps. The division was disbanded in September 1918 and its assets distributed to other units. When originally formed, the division had two reserve infantry regiments from the Province of Westphalia (255th and 256th) and one from the Rhine Province (257th). The two Westphalian regiments were replaced late in the war by the 332nd Infantry Regiment, a garrison regiment from Posen with two Rhineland battalions and one Posen battalion (with a number of Poles as well as Germans), and the 419th Infantry Regiment, a thoroughly mixed unit made of companies taken from different regiments. Combat chronicle The 77th Reserve Division initially fought on the Eastern Front, seeing its first action in the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes. It later fought in the Gorlice-Tarn√≥w Offensive, including in the siege of Kovno and the battles of the Neman River, Grodno, and Vilnius. The division remained in the Courland region near Daugavpils throughout 1916 and until September 1, 1917. It then fought in the Battle of Riga and afterwards remained in positional warfare north of the Daugava River. After the armistice on the Eastern Front, the division briefly served in Livonia and Estonia, and then was transferred to the Western Front. It fought in the 1918 German Spring Offensive, seeing action in the First Battle of the Somme (1918), also called the Second Battle of the Somme (to distinguish it from the 1916 battle). After more fighting in the Somme region, the division went to the Wo√´vre region, between the Meuse and Moselle Rivers. The division was hit hard by the American attack on St. Mihiel, losing a large number of prisoners, and was dissolved shortly thereafter, with the remnants being distributed to other units. Allied intelligence rated the division as third class.Histories of Two Hundred and Fifty-One Divisions of the German Army which Participated in the War (1914-1918), compiled from records of Intelligence section of the General Staff, American Expeditionary Forces, at General Headquarters, Chaumont, France 1919 (1920), pp. 531-533.

The first series was broadcast in 2000, second series in 2001 and the third series in 2002. They are still being shown in the U. K and in other parts of the world.BBC One of the main characters in the series was Mrs Croker, played by Jean Marsh ( who also acted in Upstairs Downstairs). Will Theakston played Roddy Oliver. The ghost boy, William Povey, was played by Lee Godwin and Roddy's sister was played by Verity-Jane Dearsley. The Ghost Hunter and The Ghost Hunter at Chillwood Castle have also been published as an audiobook and in large print. The Ghost Hunter is also published in Japanese. The Ghost Hunter's House of Horror was the third book published by Scholastic. His picture books, including The Golden Cage (Andersen Press), and The Lazy Giant (Oxford University Press, illustrated by Dee Shulman) and in the USA (Dingles & Co) are written in a classic fairy-tale style and contain a moral. The Golden Cage is illustrated by Ken Brown and is also published in France (By Gallimard) and in Sweden. His best-selling stories about Zot the Dog, published by Puffin Books, are humorous and zany. The first title, Adventures of Zot the Dog, was first noticed by Elizabeth Attenborough when the manuscript arrived at Penguin Books. The book originally published in hardback, was chosen as one of the best books of the year by Julia Eccleshare. Other titles followed: Zot's Treasures, Zot Solves It and Zot Goes Camping. The books are illustrated by Judy Brown. The stories were adapted into a 13-part animated cartoon series for ITVZot the Dog and subsequently released on video.see YouTube for clip and Amazon for book details The books were dramatised for Cannon Hill Puppet Theatre and the production ran for 88 performances in Birmingham, as well as touring schools nationally. Jones has published other books, notably The Battle for Muck Farm, (Hodder and Stoughton, illustrated by Georgie Birkett,) which is a magical fantasy about a girl called Kitty and her strange and mysterious horse friend, Humpy Lumpy.  Plays  Early in his career, Jones wrote a weekly comedy for BBC Radio called Lost Hollow. Lost Hollow is the name of the village round which the series was based; a village cut off from the outside world and full of eccentric characters such as Reginald Pustule Quatt, Gilbert Sludge and Madame Cochon. Parts of the drama are satirical, while other parts are gently humorous ‚Äì exaggerating rivalries and characters of village life. The series ran for 60 episodes and was produced and directed by Diane Kemp. Ivan Jones' play Shelter was one of the winning entries for the Midlands New Writers Festival. This is a moving, sometimes tragic, play with powerful themes of homelessness and fantasy. It contains strong characters and explores such themes as young love, anger, religion and escapism. The central character's obsession with James Bond is both a parody of Fleming's character but also an exploration of the power of such a character on the workings and imaginings of a young person's mind. Jones' stage play Winterblock's Ghost was performed at Leicester Haymarket, with the lead role played by Colin Hurley. This is a play in the absurdist tradition. It uses black humour and grotesque characters. All the action takes place in the offices of an educational bureaucracy where absurd struggles for power take place ‚Äì and where a ghost seeks revenge.  Poems  As well as his other writing, Ivan Jones has published many poems for adults and children, including the very successful Good Night, Sleep Tight, which is published by Scholastic and Scholastic Inc (USA). The book contains a poem for every night of the year (365 in all) and each month is illustrated by a different, well-known artist. Many of Jones' poems were commissioned for BBC schools' radio, including several about Kochi in India, viz: The Chinese Fishermen at Kochi; Water City; Monsoon Storm. Some of these poems were read for radio by Michael Rosen. Other commissioned works included poems The Magpie, Birds Arrive and many about \\"the sea\\". Numerous other poems appear in collections such as I Love You, Football; and I Wanna Be Your Mate, (edited by Tony Bradman ) and Spooky Poems, (published by Scholastic). More recently poems have appeared in collections edited by Gaby Morgan (Macmillan). One of Jones's controversial poems, \\"Ironbridge\\" is featured in several collections including \\"Between the Severn and the Wye\\" edited by Johnny Coppin.  Adaptations  He has adapted many children's books for Radio 4 and Radio 7 including: * The Machine Gunners by Robert Westall * Al Capone Does My Shirts by Gennifer Choldenko * The Pig Scrolls by Paul Shipton * Wolf Brother by Michelle Paver * The Fantastical Adventures of the Invisible Boy by Lloyd Alexander * Chinese Cinderella by Adeline Yen Mah * The Girl with the Broken Wing by Heather Dyer * The Daydreamer by Ian McEwan. * Stunt Girl by Jonny Zucker. * The War Diaries of Alistair Fury by Jamie Rix * Avril Crump by Angela Woolfe. * Smile by Geraldine McCaughrean * Notes from a Liar and her Dog by Gennifer Choldenko * Vinegar Street by Philip Ridley  Personal life  Ivan Jones is married to the author, Mal Lewis Jones.

Municipally, it is incorporated as Parfinskoye Urban Settlement, the only urban settlement in the district. Population: History The village of Parfino was first mentioned in chronicles in 1495. The Lovat River was a part of the Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks, one of the oldest trading routes passing through Rus. The railway station opened between 1895 and 1897 also got the name of Parfino. In 1910, a construction of a plywood factory started between the village and the station of Parfino. Though formally the factory was built on the lands belonging to the village of Zhereslo, the factory settlement became known as the settlement of Parfino. It belonged to Starorussky Uyezd of Novgorod Governorate, and after 1927, to Starorussky District of Novgorod Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On July 23, 1930 the okrugs were abolished, and the districts became directly subordinate to the oblast. In 1933, Parfino was granted an urban-type settlement status. The area was occupied by German troops between August 1941 and 1943. On July 5, 1944, Starorussky District was transferred to newly established Novgorod Oblast. On December 13, 1968 Parfinsky District was split off Starorussky District, and Parfino became the district center.

Dutton, Inc. was a logician, grammarist, author, priest (Vicar of Wootton St Lawrence, near Basingstoke, England), and an influential beekeeper. He was also an early proponent of English spelling reform. He observed that bees produce wax combs from scales of wax produced in their own bodies; and he was among the first to assert that drones are male and the queen female, though he believed worker bees lay eggs. Biography Butler was born into a poor family in Buckinghamshire, South East England, but became a boy chorister at Magdalen College, Oxford at the age of eight. At the age of ten, he matriculated, taking his BA in 1584 and his MA in 1587. In 1593, Butler became Rector of Nately Scures in Hampshire in 1593 and in 1595 became also Master at the Holy Ghost School, Basingstoke. He resigned to accept an incumbency at Wootton St Lawrence in 1600 and served that rural post until his death on 29 March 1647. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the chancel of his church. Beekeeping Butler was engaged in beekeeping at his rural parsonage in Hampshire and made the first recorded observations about the generation of beeswax, which was previously thought to be gathered by honeybees from plant materials. He was not the first to describe the largest honeybee as a queen, rather than king - a distinction usually granted to Spaniard Luis Mendez de Torres for his 1586 observation, which was confirmed by Swammerdam's later microscopic dissections. However, Butler popularized the notion with his classic book The Feminine Monarchie, 1609. Butler may have misinterpreted the queen's function when he found queenless colonies sometimes develop eggs laid by \\"laying workers\\", however there is no doubt he saw the queen as an Amazonian ruler of the hive. As an influential beekeeper and author, his assertion that drones are male and workers female, was quickly accepted. For his discoveries and his book, Butler is sometimes called the Father of English Beekeeping. The Feminine Monarchie The Feminine Monarchie, originally published by Joseph Barnes, Oxford, in 1609, is the first full-length English-language book about beekeeping. It remained a valid and practical guide for beekeepers for two hundred fifty years, until Langstroth and others developed and promoted moveable comb hives. Butler revised The Feminine Monarchie in 1623 and 1634. It was translated into Latin in 1678 and 1682, then from Latin back to English again in 1704. The title expresses Butler's main idea that the colony is governed, not by a king-bee, as Aristotle claimed, but by a queen-bee. The last edition written by Butler contains ten chapters, including sections regarding bee gardens, hive-making materials, swarm catching, enemies of bees, feeding bees, and the benefits of bees to fruit (pollination). The book gives an excellent account of skep beekeeping, including methods of predicting - from tone pitch of the buzzing bees - when swarming might occur. Butler even transliterated the tones and included the Bees' Madrigal on a musical score in the 1623 edition. He further suggested that musicians may trace the roots of music back to the sounds of the hive.Sarton, George (1943). \\"The Feminine Monarchie of Charles Butler\\", Isis, Vol 34, No 6. pp. 469-472. Spelling reform Charles Butler published an English grammar (1633) with proposals to improve spelling to a phonetic alphabet. In his book, Butler condemned the vagaries of traditional English spelling and proposed the adoption of a system whereby 'men should write altogeƒëer according to ƒëe sound now generally received'. The 1634 edition of his beekeeping classic was written and published in his new orthography. Other writings Butler authored a bestselling school textbook, The Logic of Ramus (1597), an introduction to the philosophy of the Protestant French contemporary Pierre de la Ram√©e. He also published a book on music theory, The principles of musik (1636), and a theological defence of marriage between first cousins, coinciding with the engagement and subsequent marriage of his daughter to his nephew.

It has a population of 10,023 (INE, 2011) and an area of . It is the capital of the A Mari√±a Oriental comarca.  Geography  The municipality of Ribadeo has approximately the shape of a 10x10 kilometer square. It is bordered to the north by the Cantabrian Sea, to the east by the Ribadeo estuary (on the other side of which is Castropol in Asturias), to the west by the municipality of Barreiros and to the south by that of Trabada. The capital of the municipality is the town of Ribadeo. There is one other town - Rinlo - and many small villages and hamlets. The highest point of the municipality is the mountain of Mondigo (), in the parish of Cubelas.  History  The first well-known settlements date from Iron Age such as the Gallaecian hillforts of Grovas, Fornelo, Meirengos, C√°rcovas, Pumarega, Torre and Aira da Croa. All of them were inhabited by the Gallecian tribe of the Egovarri. During the 6th century the first texts referred to this county as part of Britonia. During the 13th century, Ribadeo received privileges from the king Ferdinand II. The town began as a settlement beside the estuary, occupying what are now the docks of Porcill√°n and Cabanela, and later expanded on to higher land. It had a wall - more for customs purposes than for defence - of which some remains are still preserved. Along with Viveiro and Mondo√±edo, it was one of the three main medieval towns of the former province of Mondo√±edo. It was granted a town charter by Fernando III, permitting a weekly market, which is still held. For a while the town was royal property and was then granted to a French nobleman, Pierre de Villeines, in recognition of his services to Enrique de Trast√°mara. After Villeines there were several further transfers of ownership; the county of Ribadeo became a possession of the House of Alba. The present Count, the twenty-seventh, is Carlos Fitz-James Stuart Martinez de Irujo. Ribadeo's peak as a town coincided with that of its port, being a focal point of the trade of Cantabria with the Baltic region: it was the only point of entry for imports of liquor (K√ºmmel) from the port of Riga. For this reason the beverage became known as K√∫mel of Ribadeo. In the mid-nineteenth century the port went into decline due to competition from other ports such as Gij√≥n. The coat of arms of the town is of medieval origin. It depicts waves of the sea on which are superimposed a golden key at an oblique angle and a silver star. The key symbolizes the town's incorporation into Galicia, and the star its northern location. Until the late seventeenth century the coat of arms lacked the star and the key was in the upright position. This older version can be seen carved in stone in 1699, in the chapel of the Virxe do Cami√±o, at which time it was already ancient.  Places of interest  Torre de los Moreno (1915). * Torre de los Moreno, the house of the Moreno brothers, built in 1915 in an eclectic style. The decoration of the facade suggests Modernism, while that of the rear recalls the neoclassical style. Its concrete and steel construction is unusual. * The parish church of Santa Mar√≠a do Campo. * The ruins of an ancient Franciscan convent. * A number of emblazoned houses in the old quarter. * Small beaches to the west below the cliffs, including As Catedrais, a popular tourist beach named for the shapes carved into the cliffs by the sea.  Demography  The urban population within the parish is more than 6,500. With contiguous villages and neighbourhoods that fall within other parishes, the population reaches 8,000. The population of the whole municipality is thought to be over 13,000, rather than the figure of just over 10,000 reported in the census. In summer, the population reaches 25,000. It is one of only four municipalities in the province of Lugo to have increased its population in the period 2000-2010.  Economy  The local economy is dominated by the service sector, in particular the retail and hotel trades. There is a fishing and commercial port, the only major port between Ferrol and Avil√©s.

The surrounding places are Puthupally, Thenganal, Kurumbanadam and Thottakad. Geography The terrain is hilly with fertile soil. The western border of the panchayat has vast paddy fields. Fundamentally, this is an agricultural village. During earlier years, Vakathanam was famous for \\"Kappa\\" and \\"Chakka\\" which are the Malayalam terms for Tapioca and Jackfruit. Over time rubber plantation trees have replaced them. Vakathanam is an important commercial center of Kottayam. The chief crops are rice and rubber. Rubber was planted in Vakathanam already in the year 1930s. In the year 1940s some cultivators of rubber cut down the trees because its cultivation did not bring any income.Sunny Kokkaravalayil, History of Vakathanam Knanaya Catholic Church 1910-2010, Vakathanam, 2012, 15.

Reserve-Division) was a unit of the Imperial German Army in World War I. The division was formed at the end of December 1914 and organized over the next month, arriving in the line in early February 1915.78\\\\. Reserve-Division (Chronik 1914-1918) It was part of the second large wave of new divisions formed at the outset of World War I, which were numbered the 75th through 82nd Reserve Divisions.This wave also included the 8th Bavarian Reserve Division. Between the first wave (42nd through 54th Reserve Divisions and 6th Bavarian Reserve Division), several other divisions were formed on ad hoc basis, mostly taking the name of their commander or place of formation, but these were not part of a planned formal wave of new divisions. The division was initially part of XXXIX Reserve Corps. The division was disbanded in September 1918 and its assets distributed to other units. The division was relatively mixed. The 258th Reserve Infantry Regiment was from the Prussian Rhine Province, the 259th Reserve Infantry Regiment was from the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, and the 260th Reserve Infantry Regiment was mainly from the Prussian Province of Hanover, with troops from the Duchy of Brunswick as well. Combat chronicle The 78th Reserve Division initially fought on the Eastern Front, seeing its first action in the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes. In May 1915, it participated in a raid into Lithuania and Courland. It later fought in the Gorlice-Tarn√≥w Offensive, and fought before Daugavpils from September to November 1915. It remained in positional warfare before Daugavpils until April 1917, after which it was transferred to the Western Front. It fought in the Second Battle of the Aisne, also called the Third Battle of Champagne (and called by the Germans the Double Battle on the Aisne and in the Champagne). It resisted the French offensive at Verdun in August and September 1917. In 1918, it fought in the Second Battle of the Marne, including in the Battle of Ch√¢teau-Thierry. After fighting between the Marne and the Vesle, the division was dissolved, with the remnants being distributed to other units. Allied intelligence rated the division as third class.Histories of Two Hundred and Fifty-One Divisions of the German Army which Participated in the War (1914-1918), compiled from records of Intelligence section of the General Staff, American Expeditionary Forces, at General Headquarters, Chaumont, France 1919 (1920), pp. 534-536.

IMVU had over four million active users in 2014. Current number of active players are 6M+, and currently the site has the largest virtual goods catalog of more than 40 million items. The business was previously located in Mountain View, California. It was also known as one of the leading practitioners of the lean startup approach. The company name was neither an acronym nor an initialism. IMVU co-founder Eric RiesEric Ries, Co-Founder and IMVU Board Observer IMVU. Retrieved: 2013-05-25. described the accidental process by which the company acquired its meaningless name, and stated \\"It's not an acronym; it doesn't stand for anything\\". Credits IMVU contains its own economy with a currency system based on IMVU \\"credits\\" and \\"promo credits¬®. A third form of currency also existed for creators, known as \\"developer tokens\\", which were earned when a user purchases an item with \\"promo-credits\\". Credits could be purchased online using actual currency directly from IMVU. Credits could also be purchased on IMVU gift cards available from retail outlets such as department stores. The credits are being used by members to purchase virtual items like fashion pieces (hair, clothes, skins, and accessories), pets, and 3D scenes such as homes, clubs, and open landscapes. Furniture could also be purchased the same way and placed into unlocked rooms, but there were also rooms that have some furniture included in them as well as locked rooms that include furniture that cannot be removed. Promotional credits, abbreviated to ‚Äúpredits‚Äù, were a second form of currency distributed to members by IMVU and could be obtained by participating in various \\"Partner\\" promotions and a few activities that IMVU provides. With relation to a standard free or full member, promo-credits were similar to standard credits. A given number of credits equates, promo-credits could not be used to purchase items as gifts for other members and may not be traded back to an IMVU re-seller for actual currency. Promo-credits used to purchase a virtual product were exchanged into \\"developer tokens\\", also known as \\"dev tokens\\". The purchase transferred the promo-credits into developer tokens but netted a single developer token per purchase when promo-credits were used regardless of the price of the product purchased. Community Many IMVU users are content creators, creating and selling products in the IMVU catalog. Users also devoted time to customizing their individual homepages, setting up public and private rooms, creating and participating in user groups (similar to forums but personalized via the owner), and participating in the Community forums. Additionally, there are numerous user-produced third-party websites providing additional forums and resources to the IMVU community. IMVU users are also able to conduct peer review on virtual products waiting to be submitted into the IMVU catalog, with a reward of 10 promo-credits per product review.

A Pontenova is a municipality in the Spanish province of Lugo. It has a population of 3199 (Spanish 2003 Census) and an area of 136 km¬≤.  A Pontenova and the Turia Valley  A Pontenova is part of the Turia Valley or ‚ÄúValle del Turia‚Äù, a small valley on the western border of the Cantabrian Mountains in the northwest of Spain which is close to beaches and is divided by two counties: Asturias and Galicia. It consists of an area of 90 km2, 3,910 inhabitants and is 200 m above sea level. There are two main towns are A Pontenova (Galicia) and Taramundi (Asturias). The Turia Valley is a range of small mountains, ancient oak forests and rivers. The climate in the region is pleasant throughout the year. As with the rest of northern Spain (or the Green Spain), the climate is more variable than the southern parts of Spain and is characterised by an Atlantic climate. The average temperature in summer is usually around 26 ¬∞C. The average temperature in winter is 8 ¬∞C (12 ¬∞C in the day and 4 ¬∞C at night). The Turia River (250 m altitude) gives its name to the valley. The Turia Valley is surrounded by hills and mountains, including, Sierra de Piedafita (900 m), Sierra de Ouroso (1033 m), Sierras de Dendin (900 m), Sierra de Teixedais (900 m) and Sierra de Eirua (700 m). The patrimony of the Valley has more than 60 religious buildings and places of worship, such as the church of San Martin de Tarimundi founded in the 18th century (Taramundi) or the Santuario de Santa Mar√≠a de Conforto founded in the 16th century (A Pontenova). UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Also A Pontenova is part of the Eo River, Oscos and Buron lands Biosphere Reserve. A Biosphere Reserve is an international conservation designation given by UNESCO under its Programme on Man and the Biosphere (MAB). The World Network of Biosphere Reserves is the collection of all 531 biosphere reserves in 105 countries (as of May, 2008). Biosphere reserves are created to promote and demonstrate a balanced relationship between humans and the biosphere. The area included in the Biosphere Reserve occupies a surface of 158.883 hectares of which 215km2 belongs to the area of the Turia Valley. Agriculture, fish farming and tourism are the principal areas of growth for the region. Although there has been a fall in the primary sector in recent years and an increase in the service sectors as rural tourism, agriculture still remains the largest economical activity of local economy. Micro businesses and family run businesses are very characteristic of the region. Construction, commerce, hotels and rural tourism also account for high percentage of local business. Rural tourism is now a growing activity in all the Reserve, at present there are about 170 establishments catered for rural tourism.  Turia River  The Turia River or ‚ÄúR√≠o Tur√≠a‚Äù is a small river, 9 km in length and an altitude of 250m above the sea, which rises in the town of Taramundi (Asturias) and drains into the Eo River in the town of A Pontenova (Lugo). The Turia river gives its name to the Turia Valley or ‚ÄúValle del Tur√≠a‚Äù that crosses horizontally before emptying into the Eo river. The Turia river is fed by numerous streams and creeks from the mountains that limit the valley, and is part of the Eo UNESCO biosphere reserve. While the river is born in Asturias, the bulk of his wealth is found in Lugo (Galicia). The Turia river is a source of industry and its waters are used to generate socio- economic activities based on ancient traditions such as Navajeros crafts and textiles, as well as the primary industry of salmon farming in A Ponenova (Lugo). *Source: Near as As Veigas, Taramundi (Asturias). *Ending: R√≠o Eo, A Pontenova (Lugo). *Distance: 9 km. *Altitude: 800m - 250m. *Tributary rivers: Small local creeks and streams. *Runs: Asturias: As Veigas, Mazonovo, Taramundi, A Garda y Mousende.

The GPO issued a range of telephone instruments to telephone service subscribers that were matched in function and performance to its telephone exchanges. General history Until 1982 the GPO had a monopoly on the provision of all telephone lines and telephones within the UK, other than in Kingston upon Hull, and so the range was limited. Customers (known within the GPO as \\"subs\\", being short for 'subscribers') did not buy their telephones, they were rented from the GPO, together with the house wiring and the wiring connecting the house to the local network at a connection point known as a DP (distribution point). The majority of DPs were (and still are) at the top of what are still known in the UK as telegraph poles.  Type 121  During the early days of telephones, in the UK, a variety of instruments were produced, in low volume, often combining new and emerging technologies with the traditional skills of the wood joiner and cabinetmaker. They were simply known as Type 1, 2, 3 etc. These were often used on simple, internal links, sometimes taking the place of the 'speaking tube' in large houses. These instrument had no dials, and signalling consisted of a hand-cranked magneto generator. Often the bell at the other end would just be 'tinkled' by simply rattling the switch hooks up and down. From these developed the first, serious, GPO instruments, the 100 series. This comprised a wall phone, the Tele. 121 and a desk phone, the Tele 150. Both were based around the same handmade, wooden case, containing the telephone circuit and bell, but unlike the bellset, shown with the Tele 150, below, the Tele 121 had the transmitter mouthpiece screwed onto the front of the box and the switch hook, holding the receiver, protruding from the left hand side. Below the mouthpiece was a dial- mount, which either contained a dial (F or L - Figures only or with Letters - from about 1926) or a blanking plate (CB). This made it a true, one-piece telephone which was available either 'stand alone', mounted on a handsome, wooden, back-board, with integral writing desk or, as a Tele. 123, combined with the original, Button A & B coin-box.  Type 150  Candlestick The 100 series, 'candlestick' two-piece telephone is now a collectible item. This one is a Tele. 150L circa 1929 and is a poor example since the original black finish has been stripped to reveal the brass. The bell receiver was originally coated in a black vulcanised rubber (Vulcanite) and the remaining brass work had a black oxide finish. The dial is also later, the original number 10 dial would also have been finished in black oxide on copper. The L denotes an alphanumeric (rather than number only) dial plate. The dial uses a slipping cam Rotary dial, as distinct from the CB (central battery) version, which was without any dial and relied entirely upon connection via the operator. The transmitter (microphone) was of a very poor, carbon granule construction, which absorbed moisture and required regular replacement. The low cost, however, ensured that this transmitter would continue to be used for many years to come. In contrast, the twin coil and diaphragm receiver was of very good quality, indeed. The Tele. 150, like its successor the Tele. 162, was actually only the 'front end' of the telephone. Containing only the transmitter, receiver and switch hook assembly; the entire electrical telephone circuitry was contained within an accompanying magneto bell set. This was initially the wooden cased version shown or the later, compact, Bakelite, Bell set 25.  Type 162 & 232  The 162 was originally launched in 1929 as the last of the 100 series. Once its potential was realised it was quickly promoted to a Type number of its own, becoming in 1934 (with some internal modifications) the 232 and staying in production until 1957. The Tele. 162 Handset Micro Telephone, was the first UK phone to incorporate the transmitter and receiver into a single unit, 'The Handset'. It was designed as a very lightweight domestic phone, which could be carried around whilst in use, by hooking the fingers under the switch-hook cradle. For this purpose it could be ordered with an extra long instrument cord at additional cost. It was even with a blanking plate instead of the dial. Like the Tele. 150, it required a bellset 25 to complete its electrical circuitry and to provide bells. This could be either screwed directly under the telephone or mounted separately in another location. The Tele. 232 came out of the box fitted with a base plate containing a drawer, holding a personal directory card. The telephone could then be screwed directly onto the matching Bell set 26, making a true, but very heavy, telephone set, or screwed down onto the desk of a CCB (coin collecting box), in a Public Telephone Kiosk. In this form it was fitted with a modified dial, a more durable handset cord, and was re-numbered as the Tele. 242. There was one other variant. With modified internals and designed purely to be used in combination with a Bellset 39a or 44, this was the Tele. 248 in the guise of the Extension Plans 5 & 7\\\\. This type of telephone is often featured in British made period television dramas. Curiously, the telephone often rings despite not being fitted with any bell unit.

The Plan 5 had 2 extensions plus the control station, the Plan 7 had only 1. The main operator control units, of these plans, appeared similar to a 232 plus Bellset 26 combo but was now a Tele 248 plus Bellset 39a (early versions) or 44 (later). These bellsets had a recess, in the front, dominated by a horizontal, quadrant mounted, 4 position slider, flanked by either 1 or 2 press buttons, for buzzing the extension(s). These Bellsets 39a and 44 were bellsets in name only, as they contained no bell. What they did contain was a maze of spring contact sets, mainly activated by a cam at the pivot of the slide switch. The system required a separate, remote mounted bellset, for incoming signalling. The main unit could make and answer exchange calls, talk to and transfer calls to the extension(s). The extensions could call and talk to each other and the main unit, but could only make external calls if a request to the operator, for the exchange line, was honoured. When this system was eventually revisited and brought up to date, with the 700 series Plans 105 and 107, the equivalent control unit was dubbed 'The Planset'.  Type 332  The 300 series equipment was introduced in 1937. The Tele. 332 ASTIC, Handset Micro Telephone was the standard telephone instrument issued by the GPO from 1937 until 1959, although 242Ls continued to be supplied for pay-on-answer kiosks. Essentially it was a redesign of the 232/bellset 26 combo. The term ASTIC indicates the use of an anti-sidetone induction coil, to permit only a small, controlled amount of speech signal back to the talker's ear to provide necessary sidetone for a natural communication experience. It continued in production until the mid-1960s. This was usually only available in black although ivory, red and, the especially rare, green were also produced. Although 332 is the generic for this model, by dint of superior numbers, there were four other models in the range. The glossy, sharp styled 332 gestated from the much poorer quality 330. Though similar, the quality and finish of the 330s moulding was poor, by comparison. Then there were the button phones. A 332 with the facility for one button is a 312, two buttons a 328 and three buttons a 314. For this reason, in the photos below the instrument on the left is, strictly speaking, a 314 and the one on the right a 312, despite the fact that their full potential is not being utilised. The Tele. 332L shown on the left is a bedside extension from an Extension Plan 1A. BELL ON - BELL OFF push buttons were added, forward of the switchook cradle. The centre button position is filled with a blanking stud and only a 2 way label is installed. The instrument on the right is a Tele 312, but has its single button hole fitted with a blanking stud. The label screws are sitting redundant in their holes. Image:GPO 332 Telephone.JPG|332 Telephone, Plan 1A extension Image:GPO 332 Director Telephone.JPG|332 Telephone from the Director ENTerprise exchange which was in New Southgate, London. This telephone was manufactured in 1946 and factory refurbished in 1963 at the GPO Factory, Cwmcarn, Wales shown by F.W.R. on the base. A label attached indicates that the exchange had just converted to all figure dialling as opposed the letters and numbers as indicated by the dial label.  House Exchange System  The 300 series was much more than just the Tele. 332. There was a whole range of similarly designed products. Fieldsets (Tappers), Headsets, Pendant Telephones, Wall Phones and the House Exchange System. Many private telephone companies had sprung up in the UK. As these were banned by law from connecting to external lines, they contented themselves with producing systems for automatically dialling between company offices, within the same building or, via private wires, rented from the GPO, virtually anywhere. The GPO could only do this via PMBXs (manual switchboards), ranging from the two to five line cordless boards, via the 25 and 50 line plug and cord boards to the mighty PMBX 1A, which, with its modular construction, could be any size a large company might require. The GPO regarded the private telephone companies as a thorn in their flesh and a great loss of potential income. They decided to tap into this lucrative market. Initially, they produced a system virtually identical to the competition and called it the House Telephone System. This appeared, from the rear, like a Tele. 332 but the front sloped down and was covered in two rows of buttons, by which a few other, similar, extensions could be called. Like the competition, this system was entirely internal and could not connect to the PSTN (Public Service Telephone Network). Unlike the competition, however, the number of extensions which could be incorporated was strictly limited. The GPO tried again. The 300 series House Exchange System, now known as the HES1, was a combination of the Tele. 332L and the House Telephone System. From both the front and rear elevations the instrument appeared as a normal 332L. From the side, however, it was a different story. The snout of the instrument had been stretched forwards a full 8 inches in order to mount two rows of call buttons along with their plastic covered labels forward of the switchooks. All stations could make and take external calls, call any other station and also transfer calls between them. For the first time, small companies did not need to employ a telephonist ‚Äì a big selling point. The main downside was that the central branch exchange unit was mains powered and used 50 Hz AC relays to route the calls. It had to be found a place out of the way as it was extremely noisy, the noise level increasing as calls were connected and relays energised.  Bell Sets 25, 26, 31, 56, 59  These were bell sets that could be used, either stand alone or attached to the base of a 232 type telephone or similar, to provide a complete telephone instrument, as Tele. 150s and Tele. 232s did not themselves have an integral telephone circuit or bell. For this reason, although mostly black, they were available in the full range of colours to complement a coloured instrument. All these bellsets appeared identical externally, with a contoured, moulded cover which looked stylish alone, but would dock firmly underneath a 232. They were all based upon the same baseplate but differed in the type of bell and whether this was alone or accompanied by a capacitor, and / or an induction coil and any other telephone circuit components and wiring.  Bell Sets 64/67  Electrically identical to Bellsets 26/56 but with an all-weather case and externally mounted bell gongs, for use where much more volume was required.  Type 706  The 700 series was the GPO's response to public demand, fuelled by American television shows, for a modern design with a helical, anti-tangle handset cord. The Telephone No. 706 was a revelation when it was first released in 1959. Again, still also available in CB (no dial) form, it was a robust design which is still in use today in the UK, suitably modified for use with the New Plan BT sockets. It was available in two-tone green, two-tone grey, topaz yellow, concorde blue, lacquer red, black and ivory. The 706 was manufactured to a GPO design, by several manufacturers. There were two basic designs: one with a modern printed circuit and another with a wiring loom. Other variations included: metal or plastic baseplates and the presence or absence of a metal carrying handle. The very first 706s had a metal dial similar to the 200 and 300 series phones. Later phones had a plastic dial. In both versions, letters and numbers surrounded the dial. 706s are usually marked 706L, which indicates that they have a lettered dial. The 706F with a figure only dial, the same as on the 746, and a plain ring around the dial with no letters or numbers was introduced in 1969. Image:GPO 706 Green Telephone.JPG|706 Two Tone Green Telephone manufactured 1963. This sample, unfortunately, has a cracked dial, but is an early version as later dials were clear Image:GPO 706 Green Telephone inside.JPG|706 Telephone inside showing the reversible regulator mounted vertically and shown in circuit A feature of the 706 was a regulator that could be used or not. The idea was, that if the subscriber was close to the exchange, the regulator would reduce the sensitivity, as it had been found that this telephone was too sensitive close to the exchange and also had a propensity for picking up radio broadcasts, from strong stations, mainly taxis. The purpose of the regulator was to vary the amount of AC speech current flowing through the transmitter and receiver, to prevent it being considered too loud by subscribers on short lines. The regulator consisted of a network of rectifiers, diodes, resistors and two thermistors. The regulator could be removed from circuit, for customers not close to the exchange. This was achieved by turning it upside down, which substituted a shorting link instead of the components. In practice the unit was normally left in circuit. The downside of this plugin module was that if the telephone was dropped or mishandled the regulator board would become loose and fall out and cause the telephone to stop working until it was replaced by a technician. Compare this with the inside of a 746 where the regulator was integrated into the main circuit board.

The thermistor is painted black to stop the glow being shown Image:GPO 706 Line balancing reverse.JPG|706 Regulator reverse] The 706 style telephone was also produced for non GPO subscribers by many of the same manufacturers that produced telephones for the GPO. These telephones can be identified by having no \\"706\\" reference on the underside and will usually have the manufacturer's own reference instead. Whilst most of these phones were superficially similar to the GPO 706 many had different internal parts including \\"tropicalised\\" versions for countries with high humidity or potential insect ingress. Image:1979 TMA7214 706 Style Two Tone Grey Rotary Dial Telephone.JPG|TMA7214 built by The Telephone Manufacturing Co in 1979 using electronic parts similar to the contemporary 746. Image:1960s Ericsson Etelphone 706 Diakon Black Rotary Dial Wall Telephone.JPG|Ericsson Etelphone with optional wall mounting kit Image:new gecophone.JPG|GEC New Gecophone NB: There were a number of hybrid types between the 300 and 700 series. These appeared as 332s but fitted with a 700 series handset and cord. Among these were the 'intrinsically safe telephones', which had 323 style bodies of a sealed metal construction in a grey hammer finish. They were for installation in environments where there was a risk of fire or explosion from sparks, such as mines and chemical plants. The 700 series was much more than just a single instrument. There were the Teles. 710, 746, the 711/741 wall phones, pendant telephones, headsets, re- styled bellsets, connection blocks and distribution panels. A full, matching range. Then there was the HES3.  House Exchange System No.3  All 700 series telephone instruments came with at least one knockout forward of the switchooks, for installing bell on/bell off switches for instance. Some, however, the Tele. 710, came with four smaller knockouts and, if you looked inside the case, two circular ones too, top right and left of the dial aperture. These, along with a host of unused holes and bracketry, on the chassis, were a source of mystery for a time. Until, that is, the small business successor to the 300 series, House Exchange System 1 was revealed. The 700 series, HES 3. This comprised, up to, five stations, all of which could call one another and make, answer or transfer calls. All of the parts of this system had to be built up, on site, by the installer, from an assortment of anonymous looking cardboard boxes and plastic bags. After installing the fixed wiring and external power supply, up to, five ordinary looking 710Ls had to be transformed into Extension Stations by removing all the knockouts and stuffing them with an incredible amount of springs, wiring and lights. Incredibly, two of the knockouts could wind up, for a full system, containing two pushbuttons each, one for each of the other four stations, L shaped to cram them into the small holes. That made a total of two supervisory lamps and six buttons on what, outwardly, seemed a normal, domestic telephone instrument. Image:GPO 706 HES.JPG|Probably the ultimate development of the 700 series telephones. A HES 3(House Exchange System) built into the shell of a 710 telephone. Image:GPO 706 HES Inside.JPG|Showing the inside of an HES 3 instrument, crammed with parts  Type 710  This was the same as a 706 but had four possible buttons or lamps fitted at the top of the case. Dummy buttons were used where neither button nor lamp was used. The ultimate task of the Tele. 710L was that of being transformed into an Extension Station of a House Exchange System No.3. (see above)  Type 711 wall-mounted  Initially with the 700 series, when a subscriber (customer) ordered a wall-mounted telephone, the attending fitter would have to requisition a standard Tele. 706L, a Bracket No. 6 and a modified, stainless steel, switch-hook assembly. On site the 706 would have its case removed, the front two feet knocked out, the instrument cord removed and the dial turned round through 180 degrees. The bracket was then screwed to the wall, the baseplate mounted on the bracket and the fixed wiring, having been led in via a hole in the baseplate, was terminated in place of the instrument cord. The two metal bezels by which the case was fastened to the chassis were removed and replaced by the new switchhook assembly. This had a bridging piece, like the carrying handle, but with two large hooks to stop the handset falling to the floor. If the instrument had an early dial bezel, carrying the letters and numbers, then this too had to be rotated 180 degrees. When reassembled, the result was an untidy compromise. It looked like what it was, an upside-down 706 with its handset hanging ungainly from the bottom and the curly cord dangling beneath. It was a relief to all concerned when all the above became unnecessary with the introduction of a purpose-built instrument. Tele 711L This was, essentially, a 706 base with a modified chassis and case. First introduced in 1961, it too could have either a steel or plastic base and wired or printed circuit internals, depending upon the manufacturer. It was supplied with the T-shaped Bracket no.6. The hooks on the top of the bracket located into the holes usually filled by the front feet. A single screw then secured the rear (bottom) of the baseplate to the bracket's upright. Only two rubber feet were left in place, to support the lower part of the instrument on the wall. There was no instrument cord, the fixed wiring being led directly in via the oblong hole on the lower left. The picture below shows one of the last 711s, having been made in 1968, the last production year. The 711 was superseded by the 741 shortly afterwards.

Subscribers had to pay extra for the Trimphone. The original design by Martyn Rowlands dates from 1964. It won a COID Design Award in 1966. Anthony Wedgwood Benn (the then Postmaster-General) presented the first one to a subscriber in 1965, but it was not available to everyone until 1968. The name \\"Trimphone\\" is apparently an partial acronym; Tone Ringing Illuminated Model. The original Trimphone was the 712 however it took a number of revisions to get right and a much improved model, the 722 came along in 1966 and was released as the 1/722 with a revised version, the 1/722 MOD, following swiftly on its heels. A further improved version, the 2/722, then became the standard issue in late 1971. With the advent of new style wiring the model numbers were prefixed with an '8' and were fitted with a 4000Œ© high impedance ringer and a new style line cord fitted with a 431A plug. Push-button models were introduced in the 70s and the final version of the Trimphone was the Phoenix phone, available in a range of new colours known as The Snowdon Collection which came in out 1982. image:Original Trimphone, On Hook.JPG|An original Tele 722, Trimphone, two tone green image:1969 GPO 1722F MOD Grey & Green Rotary Dial Trimphone Telephone.JPG|1969 1/722F MOD grey & green Trimphone telephone image:1971 GPO 1722F Two Tone Ivory Rotary Dial Trimphone Telephone.JPG|1971 1/722F grey & white Trimphone telephone - one of the last of this type image:1971 2722 Trimphone telephone in grey and white.JPG|1971 2/722F grey & white Trimphone telephone - one of the first of this type image:8722G Snowdon Collection telephone in black and grey.JPG|1982 8722G Snowdon Collection Trimphone telephone in black and grey  Type 726  In the UK, a brief excursion from standards, GPO telecoms introduced in 1967 their first push-button telephone, the GPO 726 (Ericsson N2000 series ), that used neither pulse dialing nor DTMF tones. It used a DC signalling system comprising a number of rectifier diodes arranged in different polarity configuration according to the button pressed. The 726 also required a ground wire as well as the usual A and B wires. The irony was that the dial signal still had to be converted to pulses in the host PABX. GPO 726 Phone  Type 741 wall-mounted  The Telephone 741 was first introduced in 1968 to replace the Tele 711, it had s similar, but slightly more angular case to the 711 but was based on the internals of the Tele. 746, with its integral regulator, extra button capacity and lamp bracketry.

These telephones were only issued to the Fire Service and originally had no dial. Image:741_telephone_in_black.JPG|1972 741 wall mounted telephone in black.  Type 746  This was an updated version of the 706L type. It was introduced in 1967 and looked very similar, although it had a slightly different case design. The 746 \\"carrying handle\\" was now an integral part of the moulded 'cow horn' switchhook cradle, whereas the 706 had a removable plastic or metal carrying handle. Unlike the 706 type it had a built-in regulator, which could not be removed. When factory modified for the 'New Plan' plug and socket system an 8 was added to the numbers, hence a 746 became an 8746. Strangely, a brown case colour was then also added to the range. Image:GPO 746 Red Telephone.JPG|For comparison, a Tele. 706L Red, an early version with coloured dial and lettered outer bezel. Pre.

Image:GPO 746 handset with amp.JPG|700 type, Amplifying Handset 214A, for the hearing impaired, with thumb-operated volume control on the side. Supplied as an optional extra for any 700-type instrument, this handset was also available with 'Lamp Signalling': a neon lamp, mounted in the top centre of the handle, flashed whenever the bell rang. Image:GPO 746 Bell Type 79A.JPG|The lower cost Bell Type 79A used in the later 746 telephones. With the dial de-mounted, the chassis clearly shows the bracketry for fitting up to five locking or momentary-operated auxiliary switches. This feature was carried over from the Tele. 710. The 700 series was able to have between one and six additional buttons fitted; these could be used for many purposes, of which the earliest was for seizing the line and getting Dial Tone for subscribers on Shared Service (party lines). The one shown in the picture was commonly used on bedside extensions, Plan 1A, to turn the bell on and off. If no button was required, the blank was left in place.

Image:GPO 746 Green Telephone with on-off button inside.JPG|Inside the green 746L, showing the single switch, centrally mounted on the five way bracket. The 746 style telephone was also produced for non GPO subscribers by many of the same manufacturers that produced telephones for the GPO. These telephones can be identified by having no \\"746\\" reference on the underside and will usually have the manufacturer's own reference instead. Image:1971 TMC 746 style telephone underside.JPG|Underside of a 1971 TMC telephone showing the non standard manufacturer reference.  Type 756 push button  Similar to the 746, but fitted with push buttons instead of a dial. Just as the 700 type came about as a result of public demand. fuelled by US television shows, so the advent of 'Touchtone Dialling' in later American TV output brought about a demand for the same at home in the UK. Unfortunately the GPO did not yet have the exchange equipment necessary to support 'Touchtone' or DTMF (Dual Tone Multi-Frequency) as the GPO preferred to call it. So they decided to introduce a simulated version instead. This would comprise a very ordinary 700 type instrument, with a push button mod. kit fitted. Beneath the smart-looking buttons, a small converter circuit, powered by re-chargeable Ni-Cd cells, would convert the button presses back to perfectly normal, 10 impulse per second, loop-disconnect dial output, i.e. the new keypad was made to simulate an old rotary dial. But this was the GPO, and nothing was ever that simple. Even though all the design research had already been done by the major US companies, The GPO decided to do it all over again. Although, initially, they decided to modify the existing 700-type instruments, what hadn't been decided was how the push-buttons should best be laid out. Completely ignoring the then-standard US layout, an experiment was put into motion at the Dollis Hill Research Centre. Mock-ups were made of every conceivable combination and layout of buttons. Each of these had its own seated operator and digital readout. All the button pads and readouts were cabled to a primitive computer. For weeks on end the computer flashed random series of numbers to the digital readouts and the operators had the task of punching these numbers, as quickly as possible, onto the keypads. The speed and accuracy rate were continuously logged, as was the ergonomic comfort of the operators. At the end of many months, much expense, and to absolutely no- one's surprise, the results came out in favour of the existing American layout! Sadly this was too late for at least one major company. ICI had decided to press ahead unilaterally with their own design, the Tele 726, which had two rows of five buttons (no # or * buttons then) set horizontally across the centre of a circular face-plate. This proved very awkward to use. This was the outcome of the trials. A perfectly normal Tele. 746, but fitted with push buttons instead of a dial and re-dubbed 756. The push buttons just created the same loop disconnect signalling pulses as a dial telephone, which caused horrendous post-dialling delay and much knuckle rapping frustration. The model shown in the photograph is actually an 8756, which has been modified to enable it to be used with the 'New Plan' plug and socket system. Image:GPO 756 Two Tone Grey Telephone.JPG|8756 Two Tone Grey Telephone Image:GPO 756 Base.JPG|8756 Base, showing that this telephone was refurbished in 1982 and that this was a telephone rented from BT  Type 766/8766 Push Button Trimphone  A loop dialling keypad version of the Trimphone was introduced in 1976 as the 766. The Trimphones were all fitted with a tone ringer which initially warbled quietly and then more loudly. With the advent of new style wiring the model numbers were prefixed with an '8' and were fitted with a 4000Œ© high impedance ringer and a new style line cord fitted with a 431A plug. In 1982 the final incarnation of the Trimphone was relaunched with a new set of colours known as The Snowdon Collection. Image:766 Snowdon Collection push button Trimphone in brown and cream.JPG|8766 Snowdon Collection Trimphone in brown & cream Image:8766 Snowdon Collection telephone in two tone red.JPG|8766 Snowdon Collection Trimphone in two tone red  Type 776 compact telephone  The 776 Compact Telephone was first introduced in 1974. Although based on the same circuitry as the 746 it was a smaller lightweight, space saving telephone and had a separate bell (bell unit 776) connected by a 3M extensible grey cord. An optional wall bracket (type 18A) for the bell unit was also available on which the telephone could stand. The Compact was available in bright blue, light grey and mid-brown. The Silver Jubilee was released in 1977 to celebrate the Queen's Jubilee year. This was made in dark blue with a specially designed motif in the centre dial. Image:776 Silver Jubilee Telephone.jpg|Special Edition Silver Jubilee 776 (SA4271) in the unique Balmoral blue colour.  Type 782 Push Button  This was a 746 type telephone which could transmit MF4 signalling, also known as DTMF touch tones. These telephones could only operate to exchanges that could deal with MF4 but they were used on PABX systems that used MF4 for internal calls from the 1970s. The TXE1 exchange could handle MF4 calls as early as the late 1960s. This was however a unique prototype exchange, which served customers in Leighton Buzzard: otherwise customers did not have access to MF4 capable exchanges until later models of the TXE4 system came into service in the late 1980s.  Plans 105 & 107  These were updated versions of the 200 type plans 5 & 7 but based on the 700 type telephone. It had a master station which was a 700 type telephone mounted on a plinth with buttons, 'The Planset 625'. The master station and the extension stations could call and speak to each other and also handle and transfer outside calls. The difference between a Plan 105 and Plan 107 was that the latter had only one extension; the former had two. On plans with the 'A' suffix, conversation between the extension and the exchange was private against the planset. On a Plan 107 both of the long buttons, on the front of the Planset 625, were connected together. Pressing either would 'buzz' the single extension. The Plansets were available in Black, Ivory and Grey, to match the three colours of telephone officially specified. However, many customers opted for contrasting case, planset and handset colours. As with the HES3, the installing engineer would have to requisition all the elements separately and assemble them on-site, from an array of packaging. With its case removed, the master instrument was then screwed down onto the Planset whilst squeezing a thick umbilical cable up through the oblong hole in the telephone baseplate. This was very difficult to achieve without damage to the wiring. The hole left in the rear of the telephone case, by the removal of the, redundant, instrument cord, now had to be filled with a matching coloured, square bung. Image:Plan 105 700 type Telephone.JPG|A Plan 105 master station in need of TLC Image:Plan 105 700 type Extension.JPG|A Plan 105 extension showing the call button  House Telephone System 2 and HES 4  These were 700 type updates on the HTS 1 and HES 1 respectively. On both systems the main improvement over their predecessors was that the rows of call buttons were now arranged transversely instead of longitudinally. This meant that the basic 706 case styling only needed to be stretched forwards by 3 inches instead of 8 as previously, on the HES. This looked neater and took up less space. Otherwise, both of these systems had the same facilities as their 300 type counterparts.  Statesman and Tremolo  The GPO (later BT) began to supply the public with a far greater range of stylish telephone instruments. With the advent of 'New Plan' sockets and changes in legislation, subscribers were now free to either rent their telephone or purchase one from any source (as long as it was an approved model). These similar telephones were initially only loop disconnect types, when introduced in the early 1980s, but were later available in MF4 (touchtone) versions. They were among the first range of BT phones to be available for outright sale. A novel feature of these phones was that both the dialing circuit and the transmission circuit were on a single microchip. The one shown in the photograph is a 9003R manufactured in January 1984 and is loop disconnect. The Tremolo has squarer, flatter styling with a handle recess in the case, below the handset, by which it may be carried in use. An unwelcome side-effect of the modern lightweight materials used on these and all later models was that the handsets were too light. Not only did they not reliably hold down the tiny micro-switch, which now served as the switchhook, but users did not like the feel of them. They felt like 'toys'. They lacked 'gravitas'. This was addressed by the simple inclusion of a steel bar in the handle of the handset to give it weight and make it feel a 'serious' piece of equipment. The telephones could be desk or wall mounted without any modification.

It's all in the chip. Image:BT Tremolo, Ivory.JPG|BT Tremolo, Ivory  Tribune  This telephone was able to operate on both loop disconnect (pulse) and MF4 (tone) dialing. The method was chosen by a switch on the base, as shown in the photograph. It was introduced in the 1980s as a basic telephone and was the last model with a mechanical bell. The volume control was the ultimate in simplicity: a plastic disc with a hole in it which could be rotated to cover over the sounder holes by a varying amount.

Also shows the wheel which is a crude method of adjusting the ringing volume  Relate and React  These telephones are able to operate on both loop-disconnect (pulse) and MF4 (tone) and a switch on the base of the telephone chooses the method. The volume of the ringer could also be changed to High, Low or Off ('off' did not actually disconnect the bell but merely locked the clapper in position so that it could not strike the bells). The Relate is shown on the left, the React has a squarer styling, without the pen-holder tray. On the underside of the Relate there is a mount that can be fitted in two positions. One makes it a desk telephone and mounting it the other way round turns it into a wall telephone ‚Äì very ingenious. On the React, the only modification required, for wall mounting, is the reversal of a tiny tab, in the receiver recess. This prevents the handset falling on the floor. A similar tab is molded onto the top of the case, to provide an 'Off Hook' parking position.

It is part of the Catholic Meelick/Parteen/Coonagh parish in the diocese of Limerick, with several generations of Coonagh families having attended Meelick National School (Scoil Mhuire Miliuc), Co. Clare. In 1111 AD, Parteen, Meelick and Coonagh were assigned to the Diocese of Limerick at the Synod of R√°th Breasail when the boundaries of the dioceses were drawn up. The Tithe Applotments of Co. Clare also indicate that Coonagh was part of the parish of Killeely in 1833.  History   Archaeology  Excavations conducted prior to commencement of building the Limerick Southern Ring Road and Limerick Tunnel uncovered treasures such as penannular ring pins, and several post-medieval brick-making kilns. Also recovered were a copper-alloy stick pin, a needle, two saddle querns, burnt stone deposits, and very high quantities of animal bone (including worked antler handles, horn cores, and spindle whorls, indicating textile making), alder wood charcoal, and charred hazelnut shells. The largest site uncovered was an Early Christian ditched enclosure at Coonagh West with a diameter of 40m that exploited a glacial drumlin, including a series of shallow gullies and oak post holes both internal and external to the enclosure, indicative of houses having been present dating back to the 16th century BC, a 27m trackway that enabled access to and from the river, pits, a hearth, as well as some pottery. Archaeologists suggested that it may have been a type of ringfort that exploited a dry gravel mound in a predominantly wet and marginal landscape. One site in Coonagh indicated evidence for human occupation in the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age periods. Six stone axeheads, a blade, a knife, arrowheads, and scrapers were uncovered. There was also evidence of charred cereal, and findings that cattle, sheep/goat, and pig were kept and eaten. The houses at Coonagh West 4 appear to be the earliest settlement, producing radiocarbon dates of 1745-1541 BC. There is also evidence of stone troughs, with one in particular indicating that the opening of a natural spring was enlarged and lined with stones through which water could percolate. Some may also have served as boiling pits. A forked branch that had been cut using an axe was also found, which may have been used as a spit. Soil samples from one of the troughs found in Coonagh indicate non-local soil samples rich in minerals, that could have been used in dyeing, or tanning and cleaning animal skins. Iron Age activity was revealed in the Eastern end of the excavation area, including the base of a small metal-working furnace cut into the gravel, and the fragment of a crucible (a vessel in which metal was melted before being poured into a mould). Analysis of the crucible indicate it was possibly used to manufacture 'leaded gunmetal', a copper and lead alloy. A possible whistle, or part of a set of pipes that were found, evokes images of social occasions and entertainment at the site. Age/slaughter patterns of animal remains found at the site indicate that the demand for meat took precedence over the demand for milk and other live animal products. Overall, the evidence shows that Coonagh was populated from Mesolithic Stone Age times through the Bronze and Iron Ages to modern day. In addition, while determining the history of the embankments along the Shannon, the excavation indicated that the reclaimed salt marshes south of Coonagh Point had only been reclaimed from the Shannon as recently as the 1820s. The Civil Survey of 1654 records that there were two fishing weirs on the Shannon in Coonagh, owned by the Earl of Thomond and Sir Nichollas Comyne. These weirs were probably those rented by John Darcy in 1678 for two shillings a year. The lease - which was to expire in 1739 - was for a 'flood weir and ebb weir belonging to Coonagh'.  Traditional way of life  Coonagh's residents traditionally made their living from the nearby Shannon River by drift-net fishing for salmon in gandelow boats, cutting reed that grows along the Shannon for sale as thatch, brick making, and farming.  Brick making  Coonagh men would harvest clay from the \\"brick holes\\" in Coonagh West. Coonagh brick was used in the building of many Georgian red brick buildings in Limerick City, notably Patrick Street in Limerick, presumably in the houses on Arthur's Quay, which were constructed by Frances Arthur between 1771 and 1791, as well as Newtown Pery. The brick was transported by river from Coonagh to Limerick City Docks. The Ordnance Survey Map of 1844 highlights brick manufacturing areas, as well as brick clamps that were excavated at Coonagh West, and the quay from which bricks were shipped. In 1901, only one brick-maker was named in the Census for Coonagh East and West, and by the 1930s, local brick making had ceased completely. Bricks from Coonagh were hand-made and fired in temporary structures called brick clamps. Water and turf (to aid combustion) were added to the clay and the mixture was worked with the bare feet of the brick-makers. The clay was then shaped by hand in wooden moulds and afterwards, unfired or 'green bricks' were allowed to dry on straw or in long rows of stacked bricks called 'hacks', with the straw imprint on the brick being a trademark of Coonagh brick. Mineralogical analyses of Coonagh brick indicate it was fired at a temperature ranging from 500 ¬∞C to 1000 ¬∞C. It is not known when brick making in Coonagh first started, but it is said that Coonagh bricks were used in Limerick City from at least the 18th century.  Reed cutting  Coonagh men used sickles to cut reed that grows along the shore of the Shannon estuary to sell as thatch, which was gathered into sheaves. After the dredging of Meelick and Cratloe Creeks in the 1960s, the sheaves were transported by gandelow to nearby Lansdowne Bridge or Sandy Bridge, where it was then loaded onto lorries for distribution. Prior to this, local farmers originally bought the reed as they were the only ones with access to the river through their own lands, either via horse and cart or later tractor and trailer. The reeds were typically used as roofing for \\"story and a half\\" thatched cottages in Coonagh and further afield, which usually consisted of a downstairs living room/kitchen with one or sometimes two rooms located off it, and a single room upstairs, similar to those that can be found in Adare and Bunratty Folk Park. The last thatched cottage in Coonagh, until recently maintained and re-thatched frequently by its owner, the late Coonagh farmer James \\"Jimmy\\" Hickey, has fallen into disrepair with his passing in March 2008.  Salmon fishing and gandelow racing  Coonagh men continued to fish and cut thatch until very recently, but these traditions are slowly fading away due to the introduction of an outright ban on drift-net fishing on the Shannon in 2006, which Coonagh fishermen protested against, and the decline in demand for thatched roofing. However, gandelow racing (a tradition on the Shannon dating as far back as 1864, if not further) is still featured as part of Limerick's annual Riverfest festival, with Coonagh crews taking part each year and often winning. Crews from Coonagh have had victories in rowing in the Currach League, four Ocean to City titles in Cork, and two Barcelona regattas. Their greatest victory was the International Great River Race on the Thames in 2008. The race is 22 miles long with 300 boats participating. The three fishermen in that crew were Thomas Davis, Robert Kenny, and Mike Grimes, whose families have fished the Shannon from Coonagh for generations. Traditional gandelows can still be seen moored on the banks of the Shannon in Coonagh West, near the toll gates north-west of the Limerick Tunnel on the M7 motorway that now passes through the area, as well as fishing cabins where the fishermen would keep their nets, oars, and other equipment. Gandelows continued to be made by hand in Coonagh until the 2006 fishing ban. As an acknowledgement of Coonagh's heritage, the emblem of Coonagh Utd. A.F.C. contains a salmon leaping from the Shannon. The fishing season would officially open on 1 February and continue to July, although it was not unusual for some households to dine on salmon instead of turkey on Christmas day. Three-man crews were the norm for Spring fishing because they were more likely to encounter severe gales and storms on the Shannon. During severe weather, two men would row the boat, keeping her head into the wind and swells. The third man would pay out and haul the 150-yard long net. In milder weather, a two-man crew was sufficient, with one man rowing and the other hauling net. Coonagh fishermen had excellent knowledge of the estuary, knowing where every rock and snag was to avoid damaging their nets, especially at low tide. The estuary was divided into drifts from Coonagh Point to the mouth of the Fergus, and were fished one boat on a drift at a time. The names of the drifts are as follows: * Thady's Lamp * Back of the Weir * Boatbed * Bloodhole * Mac's Creek * The Rock Lamp * Over the Rocks * Burgess * The Stakes Creek * The Flats * The Stones of The Ditch * The Ditch * Deddy Tide * The Murdering Creek * The Little Rock * Between the Rocks * Ardbane Rock * Ardbane Creek * Ballandrae * The Gravel * Lynches * The Quay * The Stakes * Stafford's Hole * The Creek * The Gut * Portdrine * Dirty Bill * Ballymorris * The Mud On the south shore, just below Mungret Quay, there was: * Cock Rock * The Half-Moon Creek * Coopers * Around the Mud * Between the Creeks * Ballandrae Creek * The Sentry Box Creek * Mrs. Mac's Mud * The County Boat Bed * The Back of the Whelps * The Whelp Rock * The Gut of the Tower * Scarlet Tower * Sandy * The Dead Woman's Hand The best salmon seasons in Coonagh were probably the 1970s, when some crews had catches of up to 100 salmon after a long day's fishing. Rene Cusack was the main fish buyer at that time, with fish being taken to O'Halloran's shop in Upper Coonagh to be weighed by the proprietors, Bessie or Josie Holloran, on their old-style weighing scale and rounded to the nearest half-pound weight. The fish were then wrapped in newspaper and sold to the customer.  History of flooding  The Down Survey of 1654‚Äì1656 (National Archives) shows land on the north bank of the Shannon as 'pasture overflowen [sic] every tide'. The embankments appear not to have fared well and in 1808, their poor condition and failure to resist floods of Spring tides was lamented by Dutton (1808, 225) in his Statistical Survey of the County of Clare: \\"Nothing can possibly be worse than the embankments along the Shannon and Fergus to keep out flood-water....as no proper person is appointed... to superintend them, it often happens, that, from the indolence or ignorance of one proprietor, the property of many others is greatly injured; when a breach is made, it is so badly repaired, that it probably stands but a very short time.\\" Royal Navy mapping of the upper Shannon estuary in 1839 labelled these embankments as 'Old Embankment' and shows the river's main channel and wide floodplain. Dutton's words may have hit home, because sometime between 1824 and 1828, Eugene O'Curry was employed as overseer during the erection of a new embankment at Coonagh. This was not adequate however, as in 1843 it was observed that the river flats are still often overflowed by the Shannon; and along the high road that traverses them, stone pillars were raised at frequent intervals as indexes of its limits on such occasions. The embankments were successful, at least in part, as they did enable the earlier 18th-century Ennis to Limerick road to move from the higher ground of the Cratloe Hills to a lower position in the alluvial flats, which stretch from the shores of the river to the base of the highlands, which rise behind the woods of Cratloe, as shown in Taylor and Skinner's map in the 1780s. In October 1961, the River Shannon again burst its banks, flooding almost all of Coonagh as far as the current site of the Coonagh Roundabout, causing much damage to homes, with many having to be temporarily abandoned. In places, the water rose to 5m high, and Coonagh once again became an island for a short time. Children had to be ferried out of Coonagh in gandelows to attend school. To prevent future flooding, higher banks were erected along the Shannon using mud and clay from the brick holes in Coonagh, and the N18 dual-carriageway now runs parallel with, and over, these embankments. Due to the floodwaters spreading fertile silt from the Shannon onto agricultural land, for many years after the flood Coonagh was a renowned spot for picking wild mushrooms.  Coast Guard station and Riots of 22 June 1848  According to papers preserved by University of Southampton Library's Digitisation Unit, Coonagh was in the mid-1800s home to a Coast Guard Station. In a documented report that references the Coast Guard station at Coonagh on June 23, 1848 and mentions the location of Coonagh as a \\"few miles below Limerick\\", a Captain Montagu Pasco, Royal Navy, Inspecting Commander, describes the events of the previous day outlining a riot on the Shannon while he was stationed at the Cooonagh Coast Guard Station. In his report, he indicates that 300‚Äì400 cot fishermen proceeded down river, destroying all the salmon weirs between the Coast Guard Station in Coonagh and Grass Island (at the eastern entrance to the Maigue River), with the exception of two or three that he managed to protect. He mentions that only for the intervention of the Royal Navy at Green's Island (located near a creek that runs to Bunratty Castle), the police would have been hurt as the fishermen chased them through the mud. He mentions that there was no breach of the peace, however, apart from the cutting of the weirs, but that the proprietors of the weirs knew all the men involved and so would be able to prosecute. He goes on to mention that he decided not to use his arms, as he could only do so if required for self-defence.  Military history: HMS Goliath and the Dardanelles  Coonagh is also known for having the highest death toll per head of population in World War I, with many Coonagh men enlisting as crew for naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign due to their nautical experience as fishermen on the Shannon, with at least 8 Coonagh men confirmed as having lost their lives when was sunk on 13 May 1915 in Morto Bay off Cape Helles, Gallipoli by torpedo fired from the Ottoman destroyer Mu√¢venet-i Mill√Æye. A memorial was erected in Coonagh to commemorate these men on the centennial anniversary of their deaths in May 2015. The names of these Coonagh men are also commemorated with their HMS Goliath comrades at the Plymouth Naval Memorial in Devon, UK. Descendants of the Coonagh men who died on board Goliath, as well as descendants of those who survived the sinking, as well as other battles during World War I, still live in Coonagh. Coonagh lost 11 men in total during World War I. The following 8 are confirmed as having lost their lives on board Goliath, which was the last ship of the Royal Navy to be lost during the First World War: # Richard Allen # Maurice Cronin # Patrick Cronin # Patrick Darby # John Davis # Thomas Davis # Thomas Grimes # Michael Hickey Three men from Coonagh survived the attack: # Patrick Barrett # Patrick Hickey # Michael O‚ÄôConnor Another Coonagh man, Denis Hogan, had been transferred off the Goliath just a short while before. Two others from Coonagh were lost in 1917. These were John Grimes on the minesweeper Redcar, off Gravelines, France, and his older brother Michael on the drifter Deliverer, just outside Dublin Bay. Patrick Davis of Coonagh lost his life when the minesweeper was involved in action with a submarine, near the Farne Islands off the English coast on November 10, 1918, the day before the war ended. His brother had gone down with Goliath in 1915. Thomas (Billy) Grimes, more commonly known as \\"Tommy Billy\\", born Apr 1882, served on board , , , RMS Baltic, , , , , HMS Orcoma, SS Vauban, and as gun crew, serving during World War I, with some indications he served during World War II also, as his last known seaman's identity card was renewed on 9 August 1943 at the age of 62. He started his naval career by training for 3 months in Bantry on board , and then went on to travel to locations including Devonport, Liverpool, the Suez Canal, New York, and Australia, returning to being a fisherman in Coonagh in between as evidenced by Census records. He was also on board SS Statesman during the Dardanelles campaign, supplying HMS Defence with munitions during blockade duty. In October 1912, he was awarded a Royal Navy Reserve Medal for Long Service and Good Behaviour. He was awarded a Good Conduct Badge (GCB) with four chevrons on 1 Aug 1917 for his service from 1914 to 1917. On 24 Aug 1925, he was awarded the 1914-15 Star, a British War Medal and a Victory Medal. He had the longest naval career of any of the Coonagh seamen, and some of his grandchildren (Bowler) and great-grandchildren (O'Sullivan) still live in Coonagh and the wider Limerick/Clare area. His navy service record number is RS2 310094. Michael Grimes (who lost his life when the drifter Deliverer was sunk on 3 November 1917) and his brother John Grimes were also recipients of the 1914-15 Star, British War Medal, and Victory Medal, with Michael Grimes' widow Mary being presented the medals on his behalf. Places of interest  Modern facilities  The Coonagh Aerodrome is home to the Limerick Flying Club, which until recently hosted aeronautical displays involving small aircraft, such as SOCATA Rallye, Tecnam P2002 Sierras and gyrocopters. Private flying lessons are available. Coonagh Cross Shopping Centre is a new shopping centre situated on the west bank of the River Shannon in the Shannon Airport and Ennis direction, when departing from Limerick city centre. It recently opened its doors for the first time and at present the anchor tenant is a 24-hour Tesco. A Travelodge hotel is located just off the Coonagh exit from the Coonagh Roundabout on the Limerick-Ennis road. Limerick Driving Range, situated opposite Limerick Flying Club in Coonagh East, provides facilities for golfers to practice their hobby. Coonagh is also home to an equestrian centre, located on Coonagh Road. There are plans in place to build a road linking Coonagh Roundabout to Knockalisheen Road, as part of the Limerick Northern Distributor Road.  Place names  Other landmarks and placenames of note in Coonagh include: * Thady's Lamp: an unmanned metal lamp tower erected to warn ships navigating the Shannon of shallow waters. Traditionally lit by oil lanterns, the lamp was replaced in recent years with solar-powered electric lighting. A second river-based lamp known as the Rock Lamp is also located nearby. * Bawneen (Irish: B√†in√¨n, usually meaning \\"a loose whitish man's work jacket of homemade undyed flannel or sheep's wool, typically worn by men at outdoor work in the west of Ireland, and the traditional garb of the currach fisherman.\\" Aran jumpers are notably made of bawneen.) However, Coonagh oral history maintains that B√°in√≠n means \\"the small white rock\\". * Cealtrach (Irish, commonly used to mean \\"burial ground\\"), also known as Craggen, is an infant graveyard and a place for unbaptised children in the townland of Clonconane in Coonagh East. * Coreen Castle - a castle apparently built by the O'Briens in the 15th century. While marked on older maps of Coonagh, no remains of the castle now stand. Shannon RFC's grounds now occupy the site of what was once Coreen Castle. * Coonagh House: \\"Situated near the townland of Coonagh West and about 15 chains east of Coreen Castle, and about 10 chains north-west of Craggen burial ground. This house, once the seat of the Sextons, was built by the family some time around 1700. It was two stories high until 1831, when it was burned and a thatched house built on its site.\\" Records show that a James Sexton, Sherriff and a Thomas Fitzgibbon Sexton, Sherriff, lived in Coonagh House in 1838 and 1839, respectively. * The Fairy Fort * Molly Allen's Bush * The Brick Holes * Johnny's Road * Gallymuckle * Badger setts are also visible just below Thady's Lamp, and Coonagh once had a large population of badgers, although illegal badger baiting in recent decades has resulted in a decline of the native population  Views from the Shannonside in Coonagh  The Coonagh side of the Shannon provides clear views of: * Carrigogunnell Castle, near Clarina on the opposite bank * Gallows Hill in Cratloe, Co. Clare, named for the execution/hanging of rebels by Cromwellian forces at that site circa 1650 * The Irish Cement Factory in Castlemungret * Cratloemoyle Castle (sometimes referred to as 'Cratloe Castle') located just to the north of the N18 road on the approach to Limerick. The castle is 5 stories high and was built sometime in the early 16th century by the MacNamara clan, one of the most powerful families in the Kingdom of Thomond. John McNamara, who died in 1780, was the last occupant of the castle and since he had no one to pass the castle onto, the castle was sold and, for the first time in 700 years, the land around the castle was not in the possession of the MacNamara family.  Sport   Soccer  Coonagh Utd. A.F.C. (founded in 1971) play their soccer at their home venue, Coonagh Road, boasting pitches and a clubhouse that Coonagh residents developed and fundraised for over many decades. Coonagh Utd. have had success in both the Clare and Limerick leagues over the years at various age groups, but has been part of the Limerick leagues in recent years, with a league and cup double for the junior team in 2003 a recent highlight. Prior to soccer being hosted at Coonagh Road, Coonagh United's home pitch was located in nearby Clondrinagh (Irish: Cluain Draighneach, meaning a place or meadow abounding in blackthorns.)  Gaelic games  Many Coonagh men also played gaelic football with the now disbanded Lansdowne Rovers club, with nearby Na Piarsaigh in Caherdavin now being the nearest G.A.A. club for Coonagh residents wanting to play Gaelic football and hurling.  Rugby  In recent years, Shannon R.F.C. have made Coonagh West their home ground, on the site of what was once known as Cusack's Farm, and prior to this, the site of Coreen Castle.  Famous people  Notable residents of Coonagh include Limerick inter-county hurlers Kevin Downes and Thomas Grimes, who play with Limerick club Na Piarsaigh, and Limerick senior and minor teams, respectively.

It involved throwing live foxes and other animals high into the air. It was practiced by members of the aristocracy in an enclosed patch of ground or in a courtyard, using slings with a person on each end to catapult the animal upwards. It was particularly popular for mixed couples, even though it was hazardous for the people launching the animals as the terrified animals would often turn on the participants. The result was often fatal for the tossed animals. Background Fox and wild boar tossing. Painting from Jagdschloss Grunewald Fox tossing would take place in an arena, usually either created by setting up a circle of canvas screens in the open or by using the courtyard of a castle or palace.Sacheverell Sitwell. The Hunters and the Hunted, p. 60. Macmillan, 1947. Two people would stand six to seven-and-a-half metres (20 to 25 feet) apart, holding the ends of a webbed or cord sling known as a Prellgarn or Prelltuch ('bouncing cloth') which was laid flat on the ground.Edward Brooke- Hitching. Fox Tossing, Octopus Wrestling, and Other Forgotten Sports, p. 102. Simon and Schuster, 2015. An animal such as a fox would then be released from a cage or trap and driven through the arena, across the sling. As it crossed the sling the participants pulled hard on the ends, throwing the animal high into the air.Howard L. Blackmore. Hunting Weapons: From the Middle Ages to the Twentieth Century, p. xxiii. Courier Dover Publications, 2000. The highest throw would win the contest; expert competitors could achieve throws of as high as 7.5 m (24 ft). On occasion, several slings were laid in parallel, so that the animal would have to run the gauntlet of several teams. The result was often fatal for the tossed animal. Augustus II the Strong, the King of Poland and Elector of Saxony, held a famous tossing contest in Dresden at which 647 foxes, 533 hares, 34 badgers and 21 wildcats were tossed and killed. Augustus himself participated, reportedly demonstrating his strength by holding the end of his sling by just one finger, with two of the strongest men in his court on the other end. Other rulers also participated in the sport. The Swedish envoy Esaias Pufendorf, witnessing a fox-tossing contest held in Vienna in March 1672, noted in his diary his surprise at seeing the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I enthusiastically joining the court dwarfs and boys in clubbing to death the injured animals; he commented that it was remarkable to see the emperor having \\"small boys and fools as comrades, [which] was to my eyes a little alien from the imperial gravity.\\"Jeroen Frans Jozef Duindam. Vienna and Versailles: the courts of Europe's dynastic rivals, 1550‚Äì1780, p. 147. Cambridge University Press, 2003. Tim Blanning. The Pursuit of Glory: Europe 1648-1815, p. 403. Allen Lane, 2007. A fox-tossing tournament of the early 18th century, as depicted in Der vollkommene deutsche J√§ger (1719) The sport was especially popular as an activity for mixed couples, with the rivalry between the separate couples adding to the entertainment. At Augustus's 1648 contest, 34 boars were driven into the enclosure \\"to the great delectation of the cavaliers, but to the terror of the noble ladies, among whose hoop-skirts the wild boars committed great havoc, to the endless mirth of the assembled illustrious company.\\" The same contest also saw the introduction of three wolves, but the reaction of the participants to this unusual departure is not recorded. The tossing of foxes and other animals was not without risk to the participants, as it was common for the terrified animals to turn on the people taking part. Wildcats were particularly troublesome; as one writer remarked, they \\"do not give a pleasing kind of sport, for if they cannot bury their claws and teeth in the faces or legs of the tossers, they cling to the tossing-slings for dear life, and it is next to impossible to give one of these animals a skilful toss\\".William Adolph Baillie-Grohman. Sport in Art: An Iconography of Sport Illustrating the Field Sports of Europe and America from the Fifteenth to the End of the Eighteenth Century, p. 241. Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent, 1919. Masquerade On occasion, tossing formed part of a costumed masquerade in which the tossed animal as well as the participants would be decorated and masked. Gentlemen would dress as mythical heroes, Roman warriors, satyrs, centaurs or jesters. Ladies would dress as nymphs, goddesses or muses. The tossed animals‚Äîhares as well as foxes‚Äîwould be \\"dressed up in bits of cardboard, gaudy cloth and tinsel\\", sometimes being decorated as caricatures of well-known individuals. At the conclusion of the tossing, the guests would head off in a torchlit procession or go indoors for a grand banquet.

It was variously placed as subspecies of the Asian gray shrew (Crocidura attenuata) or the Southeast Asian shrew (Crocidura fuliginosa), but morphological differences and the large distance between the species indicate that it is an entirely distinct species.  Description  The Christmas Island shrew, like other members of the genus Crocidura, is a small short-legged mammal with a distinct pointed muzzle. It has a dark grey to reddish brown coloring. Like all other shrews, the Christmas Island shrew resembles a mouse and weighs in a range between 4.5g-6g. The Christmas Island shrew varies from other forms of the species in that it is beset with long fine hairs, and its tail is much greater in length.Andrews, C. W. 1900. A Monograph of Christmas Island (Indian Ocean). British Museum of Natural History, London, UK. The typical lifespan for its genus is approximately one year, but Crocidurine shrews have been reported to live for up to two years in the wild.Meek, Paul (2000). \\"The Decline and Current Status of the Christmas Island Shrew\\" (PDF). Australian Mammalogy. Jump up ^  Habitat  The Christmas Island shrew is a terrestrial animal that occupies tall plateau rainforests with deep soil, as well as the shallow soil of terrace rainforests. It remains unknown if the species can live in secondary growth. This shrew feeds primarily on small beetles and uses holes in rocks and tree roots for shelter.  Status  The most recent specimens of C. trichura were found in 1985, although a survey conducted fifteen years later failed to find any individuals. The current population trend is unknown. According to Version 3.1 of the IUCN's criteria for critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable species, C. trichura is critically endangered and possibly extinct.  Causes for endangerment  There is conclusive evidence that Crocidura trichura has declined dramatically since 1900, yet the reason is unproven. After an unconfirmed sighting in 1958, it was rediscovered in 1985 when two specimens were caught. The two individuals later died. Several unconfirmed reports occurred between 1996 and 1998 but a survey undertaken in 2000 failed to find any individuals. The reasons for the population's reduction are unknown but potential threats include disease, habitat loss, habitat alteration due to invasive weeds, predation from species such as cats and black rats, small population size, and mortality from road traffic. Its disappearance in recent times might be caused by the accidentally introduced yellow crazy ant (Anoplolepis gracilipes), which is a dangerous threat for many terrestrial animals on Christmas Island.  Trypanosoma disease  The theory of Durham (1908) and Pickering and Norris (1996) report that the decline of two endemic rats may be attributed to the infection of the Christmas Island shrew, according to local researchers. This forest dwelling mammal was at first thought to have vanished by 1908, probably due to a trypanosoma disease carried by introduced black rats, which is also considered a likely cause of the extinctions of Maclear's rat and the bulldog rat. The initial drop in C. trichura‚Äôs population size occurred around the same time as the introduction of the Rattus rattus (the black rat), which carried a murid trypanosome. Evidence of the black rat and/or the parasite causing the Christmas Island shrew's population decline is not solid.  Gecarcoidea natalis  Another theory on the decline of Crocidura trichura is linked to the demise of the two endemic rats, and the competition left amongst the Christmas Island shrew and the Christmas Island red crab (Gecarcoidea natalis) for leaf litter resources. The decline of predator rat species allowed for the quickened rise of G. natalis, a usual prey of the rats. This could have forced C. trichura into new habitats such as tree canopies, or sites with low crab abundances. The population of C. trichura may have been pressured by their vulnerability during weaning. They left the nest immediately and tended to aimlessly wander as juveniles, making them vulnerable to predation by crabs.  Recovery  The Australian Government has adopted a recovery plan for the Christmas Island shrew consisting of two stages of objectives Stage 1: * Clarify the taxonomic status of the Christmas Island Shrew * Clarify the current status and distribution * Develop a Wildlife Management program for the habitat * Control abundance and spread of Yellow Crazy Ants * Implement community awareness program that may assist in the location of previously unknown populations Stage 2: * Establish Captive breeding populations from any wild populations of shrews found * Effectively protect and manage wildlife population * Identify Habitat critical to survival including shelter, breeding, and foraging habitat * Determine and mitigate threatening processes affecting populations The Australian Government also believes that habitat protection from or eradication of the Yellow Crazy Ant is vital in order for the species to fully recover. The Yellow Ant is known to be extremely destructive to the ecosystem on Christmas Island, often killing land crabs, endemic reptiles, and a wide range of native invertebrate. The Yellow Crazy Ants are believed to be a danger to all mammals, birds, and reptiles on the island because the ants either act as predators to the species or deplete its resources and destroy the habitat in which the species lives, causing loss of life in both scenarios.

Nevertheless, it has a wide variety of habitats, including Mopane, Combretum and brachystegia woodland, as well as open savanna, dambo, and riverine areas. Mwabvi was the last natural home to Malawi's Black Rhino population, but both wildlife and woodland have been poached over recent years. However many species of antelope, including kudu, sable, impala and nyala, are present, and even leopard and hyena have been seen. Buffalo still bathe in the Mwabvi river, and, although the number of human tourists is low, lions from neighbouring Mozambique are regular visitors. The scenery is spectacular, with views over the Shire River and the Zambesi river, and the magnificent sandstone outcrops give an almost lunar feel to the landscape. Mwabvi is located in Nsanje District, at the very southernmost point of Malawi, right against the border with Mozambique. It includes a portion of the Matundwe Range, which form the border with Mozambique, and the adjacent Shire River lowlands. The park lies at a low elevation and summer temperatures are extreme. The best time for game viewing is during Malawi's cooler winter months. Mwabvi is not far from Lengwe National Park and the Majete Wildlife Reserve. Travel through the park is only possible on foot or with a robust 4x4, but the park is manned and thanks to PAW's extensive road building programme both game walks and game drives are available and can be arranged with the game scouts or via Chipembere Camp, the base for Project African Wilderness. Project African Wilderness, a not for profit organisation, was formed in 2004 with the express purpose of protecting and restoring the Mwabvi reserve, working with the local communities and improving their livelihoods as a result. In February 2007 Project African Wilderness signed a management agreement with the Malawi Government's Department of National Parks and Wildlife to take over the conservation and development of the park. Because of poaching, the park has seen a substantial depletion of its larger animal population, although efforts are underway to restore the park's infrastructure and diversity. In 2010, as a result of the work done by project African Wilderness and their Malawian sister company the Mwabvi Wildlife and Community Trust (MWCT) Mwabvi opened Njate Lodge, with six en-suite chalets, and, for the more adventurous traveller, Migudu campsite, which has plots for 6 tents and provides washing and camp fire facilities.

Beriozkas sold luxury goods such as chocolate and caviar that were generally unavailable in traditional Soviet markets and shops. In English-language advertisements and signs, the spelling was always \\"Beriozka\\" rather than the more conventional transliteration \\"Beryozka.\\" Such shops allowed the Soviet government to collect foreign currency with efficiency and to then use that currency to purchase goods and services from the countries issuing the currency, countries which might offer poor exchange rates for Soviet rubles but would honor their own currency at its face value. One chain belonged to the Vneshposyltorg (Foreign Mail Order Trade) and was intended for Soviet citizens who received some income in foreign currency. Some of them were forced to sell their currency for ruble-denominated Vneshposyltorg checks, while others never laid their hands on foreign currency, receiving their pay from Western sources in Vneshposyltorg checks via Soviet intermediaries (which, again, allowed the foreign currency to stay in Soviet government hands). The checks were to be used to purchase goods in the Vneshposyltorg Beriozkas. The other chain sold goods directly for foreign currency and for Vneshtorgbank series D checks. Soviet citizens (except for high-ranking officials) were not allowed to enter these stores as they were legally forbidden to be in possession of foreign currency. The foreign currency stores were named Beriozka only in the territory of the RSFSR. Other republics of the Soviet Union had similar stores usually named after their \\"national trees.\\" For example, foreign currency stores were named Kashtan (Chestnut) in the Ukrainian SSR, Ivushka (a tender diminutive for \\"iva\\", ivy) in Belarusian SSR, Chinara (Oriental plane) in the Azerbaijan SSR, and Dzintars (amber) in the Latvian SSR. Beriozka stores were present only in the major cities, most prominently Moscow. There were also separate Albatross stores in the Soviet port cities, e.g. Vladivostok, that sold goods to Soviet sailors returning from abroad. The Albatross stores sold goods for Torgmortrans checks issued by the Department of the Soviet Naval Fleet in exchange for foreign currency earned by the sailors. Beriozka stores were opened in 1964. Their predecessors were Torgsin stores of the 1930s and the highly ineffective Vneshposyltorg departments of the large Soviet department stores (e.g. State Universal Store) that allowed catalog mail order from abroad by customers paying in hard currency. Beriozka stores became obsolete in the early 1990s when conversion of rubles into foreign currency was allowed. The stores were privatized and in the mid-1990s most were closed as uncompetitive. Many other countries had similar institutions, such as Intershops in the German Democratic Republic or Friendship Stores in the People's Republic of China, Pewex in Poland, though some of these systems allowed anyone with foreign currency to shop there.

Early life and education Momƒçilo Ninƒçiƒá was born in Jagodina on to Aaron and Paula Ninƒçiƒá. His family was of Jewish descent, and originated from the town of Kanji≈æa in northern Serbia. Ninƒçiƒá's father was a well-known lawyer and judge in Jagodina, and served as Serbian Minister of Justice between 1895 and 1896. In 1903, he was elected to the Parliament of Serbia. Ninƒçiƒá finished primary school in Jagodina and attended high school in Belgrade. He finished law school in Paris and received his doctorate in 1899. Political career He held several ministerial positions in the government of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia as a member of the People's Radical Party, beginning in 1912. He was president of the General Assembly of the League of Nations from 1926-27. During World War II he was a member of the Yugoslav government in exile in London, holding the position of Minister of External Affairs. \\"Close relations with the three Great Allies had been Ninƒçiƒá's aim from the beginning of exile,\\" wrote Steven K. Pavlowitch, Senior Lecturer in History at the University of Southampton. \\"Naturally, he wanted to draw nearer to the U.S.A., as there appeared to be a tremendous amount of goodwill to be tapped across the Atlantic. The Royal Yugoslav government invested much energy in this effort, and was at first successful.\\" Ninƒçiƒá accompanied young King Peter II of Yugoslavia on a visit to the United States and Canada in June-July 1942 which generated good publicity for the \\"Yugoslav cause,\\" but in practice the concern shown by the Roosevelt Administration amounted to no more than superficial benevolent attitude. At the post-war Belgrade Process he was found guilty of installing Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá as leader of the Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland Chetnik force and supporting him and the army. Mihailoviƒá in turn warred with the Yugoslav Partisans. After the war, the communists under Tito took power in Yugoslavia. The military court in Belgrade sentenced General Dragoljub Mihailoviƒá to death in 1946 and also passed a sentence in absentia of eight years hard labour on Momƒçilo Ninƒçiƒá, Minister for Foreign Affairs in the government of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia between 27 March 1941 and 2 January 1943. The accused was found guilty of continuing the policy of the pro-fascist dictatorship in old Yugoslavia and pursuing a policy supplying the occupation and suppressing the Communist National Liberation uprising. (See: \\"The Trial of D. Mihailoviƒá,\\" Belgrade, 1946, pp. 528 and 540). The indictment of the British Foreign Office officials was even worse: > \\"an insufferable bore and a clumsy liar,\\" \\"an extreme Serb,\\" \\"an > obscurantist and obstinate intriguer with a pro-German, pro-Italian past, a > not very pleasant present, and [....] no future at all,\\" \\"an evil old man,\\" > \\"garrilous[sic] and muddle-headed,\\" \\"tortuous and hidebound.\\" Such were the views expressed by George William Rendel, British ambassador to the Yugoslav government (to Howard, 16 September 1942), D. Howard, head of the southern department (to Campbell, 3 March 1942; O. Sargent, deputy under- secretary (minute, 12 November 1942; and to Campbell, 16 July 1942) and Anthony Eden (minute, 17 May 1942): London Public Record Office. Ninƒçiƒá died in exile in Switzerland in 1949. He had written serious disquisitions on European, Serbian and Yugoslav politics. In 2006 a court in Serbia rehabilitated Momƒçilo Ninƒçiƒá to the same stature he held before the communist party and people of Yugoslavia won power and freedom in anti-fascist struggle. Against her parents' wishes, his daughter Olga married a Bosnian Muslim student activist, later Communist Yugoslav apparatchik, Avdo Humo, just before World War II and stayed in occupied Sarajevo when her parents fled with the royal government to Britain in 1941.

He has five siblings: Heloiza, Anderson, Renata, Juninho e Helena. He first got involved with music by the age of 14. By that time, he also developed an interest for drawing, but soon quit it to devote to music. As an evangelic, he performed on a local church and won many festivals of Gospel music. He soon moved to Juiz de Fora, without the approval of his family, who didn't believe he could survive all by himself. Those were difficult times for him, but he couldn't tell anything to his parents, otherwise his father would take him back to the family. He would play with friends in local pubs and restaurants for a living.

It stood on the north side of Cannon Street, between Salters' Hall Court and St Swithin's Lane, which runs north from Cannon Street to King William Street and takes its name from the church. Of medieval origin, it was destroyed by the Great Fire of London, and rebuilt to the designs of Sir Christopher Wren. It was badly damaged by bombing during the Second World War, and the remains were demolished in 1962. Medieval church St Swithin's Church was first recorded in the 13th century, and was dedicated to Saint Swithin,\\"The City Churches\\" Tabor, M. p104:London; The Swarthmore Press Ltd; 1917 a 9th-century bishop of Winchester. At first known as \\"St Swithin in Candlewick Street\\" (the medieval name of Cannon Street), in 1597 it was referred to as \\"St Swithin at London Stone\\", and this became the normal designation. London Stone itself stood on the south side of Candlewick Street, opposite the church. One of the earliest references to the church is as the final resting place of Catrin Glynd≈µr, wife of rebel Edmund Mortimer and daughter of Owain Glynd≈µr, the legendary Welsh leader. She was taken hostage when the English recaptured Harlech Castle in 1409, and incarcerated in the Tower of London. Catrin Glynd≈µr died in mysterious circumstances four years later. The only record of her death is in the Exchequer documents of 1413: \\"for expenses and other charges incurred for the burial of the wife of Edmund Mortimer and her daughters, buried within St Swithin's Church London ... ¬£1\\". The church was rebuilt at the expense of Sir John Hind in 1420, renovated in 1607‚Äì1608, and again, shortly before the Great Fire, at a cost of ¬£1,000. The patronage of the church belonged to the priory of Tortington in Sussex until the Dissolution of the Monasteries, following which Henry VIII granted it, along with the prior of Tortington's nearby London house, to John, Earl of Oxford. After passing through the hands of several owners both mansion and the patronage of the church were bought by the Salters Company. Rebuilding after the Great Fire St Swithin's Church and London Stone as shown on the \\"Copperplate\\" map of c.1553‚Äì59 The south front of Wren's church of St Swithin London Stone, in an engraving after T. H. Shepherd, 1831. Destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666, the church was rebuilt to a design by Sir Christopher Wren in 1678 at a cost of ¬£4,687 4s 6d. The parish was united with that of St Mary Bothaw, also destroyed in the fire, but not rebuilt. The new church was 61 feet long and 42 feet wide. It had a tower and spire rising from the north-west corner of the building, with a total height of about 150 feet. The south, east and west fronts each had three windows, with an elliptical pediment over the central one; the pediment on the south front, towards Cannon Street, was decorated with a carved wreath, flanked by festoons in high relief, while the heads of the flanking windows were decorated with festoons of drapery. This decoration was omitted on the other sides. Most of the length of the north side had other buildings against it. The church was rectangular in plan. The northwest corner was occupied by the tower, and the rest of the north side was taken by an aisle, containing a gallery. Most of the church, however, was covered by an octagonal dome, springing from seven half-columns against the walls, and from one complete column in front of the north gallery. Robert Seymour described the building in 1733: > This church and tower are well built with Stone, the Roof covered with lead, > supported with Demy-Columns of the Composite Order; the floor is paved with > stone, and pewed, with three Isles...and the whole is commodious and > pleasant, tho' small. An organ was installed in 1805. Later history In 1742 London Stone, from which the church took its name, was moved from the south side of the street to a location beside the church door. Eventually in the 1820s it was placed in an alcove within a stone casing set into the south wall of the church, where it remained until the demolition of the church in 1962. In around 1820 repairs were made under the supervision of Henry Elmes. Further repairs, and internal alterations, were made in 1869. The pews, which had formerly faced south, were cut down and turned towards the east, galleries were removed, the pulpit was lowered and its sounding board taken away, and a brass chandelier that had hung from the centre of the dome taken down. In 1879 the chancel was remodelled, and a vestry constructed beneath the north gallery. In 1940, during the Second World War, the church was badly damaged in an air raid. Only the pulpit was salvaged; it is now at All Hallows by the Tower.Pulpit salvaged The church was not rebuilt; instead the parish was united with that of St Stephen Walbrook in 1954, and the site sold in 1960. The ruined church was finally demolished in 1961‚Äì1962. Demolition of the Wren church, 1961‚Äì1962 Excavations were carried out on the site by Professor W. F. Grimes on behalf of the Roman and Medieval London Excavation Council. The northern edge of a Roman street on the line of Cannon Street was discovered, with timber and stone buildings to the north of it. Foundations of the early 15th-century church were discovered below those of the Wren church. The medieval church, which was slightly smaller than the Wren church, consisted of three bays, with a nave and north and south aisles. This structure, presumably the rebuilding of 1420, replaced an earlier church of which few traces remained; these suggested it had been a simple building with a nave and a single aisle, dating to the 12th century. A medieval grave slab of Purbeck marble was found reused in the foundations of the Wren church. The inscription revealed that it had covered the heart-burial of Joanna, wife of Fulke de St Edmond who had been one of the sheriffs of the City of London in 1289‚Äì1290. The slab is now in the Museum of London. London Stone was installed in the front of the new building, numbered 111 Cannon Street. The churchyard was retained as a public garden. It was re-landscaped in 2010, in conjunction with a new development just to the north. It contains a memorial to Catrin Glyndwr, additionally dedicated to the suffering of all women and children in war. There is a church mark in nearby Salters‚Äô Hall Court.

He was the promoter of the Amarillo, Texas-based Western States Sports promotion. Early life Sarpolis was born in Newport, Pennsylvania to Lithuanian immigrants. He had a love for music and could play several instruments. During enrolment at the University of Chicago, he made money performing in a band.National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 310, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, He also played football for coach Amos Alonzo Stagg. After serving in World War I, he attended medical school at Rush College and in 1926 earned a medical degree from Loyola, following in his brother's footsteps. Wrestling He was recruited into wrestling by Jack Pfefer in 1926, who recommended that he emphasize his Lithuanian heritage. He wrestled Jim Londos in San Francisco on July 12, 1932. The match had an attendance of over 10,000. In 1933, he claimed the undisputed championship of Lithuania by winning a tournament in Cleveland. During the Great Depression, Sarpolis would book in Dallas for Ed McLemore. He occasionally refereed and filled in for injured wrestlers and filled in for wrestlers who missed bookings. His nickname was \\"Doc\\", and he purchased one-third of the Texas Wrestling Agency with Sigel and Burke. The group would book grapplers into Dallas, San Antonio, and other cities in Texas. In April 1953, he sold his stake and jumped to McLemore‚Äôs anti-NWA outfit. Amarillo In 1955, Sarpolis and Dory Funk bought out Dory Detton's Western States Sports promotion in Amarillo for approximately $75,000. The West Texas territory had the Funk family as its headliners. Once known for junior heavyweights, the new ownership transformed Amarillo into an area featuring grapplers of all shapes and sizes. Although Funk was considered a potential replacement for Pat O‚ÄôConnor as NWA world heavyweight champion, the NWA decided to go with Buddy Rogers as champion. The Amarillo office then chose to recognize Gene Kiniski as champion instead.National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 311, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, Sarpolis continued to pay membership dues and In August 1962 was elected president of the NWA. He became the first president to recognize a champion other than the NWA titleholder. Even after Lou Thesz defeated Rogers for the NWA title in Toronto, Sarpolis continued to recognize Kiniski and then Dory Funk, Jr. as champion. At the August 1963 NWA convention in St. Louis, members worked to reach a solution and the Amarillo office agreed to recognize Thesz. Losses to The Shiek and Thesz led to the eventual phasing out of Dory Jr.‚Äôs championship.National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 215, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, Throughout the 1960s, Sarpolis and Funk, Sr. had working agreements with Sam Muchnick, Verne Gagne, Bob Geigel and Jim Barnett. The Amarillo production had Stanley Blackburn as its kayfabe commissioner, Shelton Key as the ring announcer, and the weekly TV shows were taped on Saturday afternoons from the studio of KVII-TV (Channel 7 in Amarillo). Sarpolis died of a heart attack on May 28, 1967 after a boating accident. The Sarpolis family would sell his shares in the Amarillo promotion to Dory Funk, Jr. and Terry Funk. Personal Sarpolis married his first wife, Josephine (n√©e Dzugas) on August 13, 1920. They had two sons: Karl Jr. died as an infant less than a year old. A second son also named Karl was born on November 20, 1924 lived in Chicago until his death on June 19, 1996. He was married on February 3, 1936 to Vivian Proctor with wrestler Ellis Bashara as his best man. He would marry a second time and had a daughter named Betty Jane on July 23, 1944.

It has a population of 2,087 (Spanish 2011 Census) and an area of 121 km¬≤. Sobrado is well known because of Sobrado Abbey, a Trappist monastery. The town is known by the name Sobrado dos Monxes in Galician or Sobrado de los Monjes in Spanish but the official name is just Sobrado. Geography  Demographics   Climate and vegetation  The town of Sobrado, in its climatic characteristics (temperatures, precipitation, humidity, hours of direct sunlight) has a climate characteristic of the European Atlantic that means wet and cool, with heavy rainfall due to greater latitude within the autonomous region and the dorsal Galician screen acting for the Atlantic storms that discharge heavy rains on this side, approaching the annual average 1,400 mm. Temperatures are a little more extreme, the result of the recession of the coastline and its position in the mountains and foothills. The average annual temperature is 8.4 ¬∞C, undergoes major changes, with highs in July to 33 ¬∞C and minimum in December to 3 ¬∞C below zero. The vast majority of the municipal territory is devoted to forest plantations while the rest goes to the crop. The cultivated areas are devoted mainly to livestock related products, and overflowing the meadows and corn. The gardening plots are reduced to around homes and in a zone where the greenhouses are beginning to abound. Orography Location of Sobrado in Galicia. From the physical standpoint, the municipality is located in a mountain area corresponding to the Dorsal Gallega. To the east and the south are the high points of the municipality, the Cova da Serpe mountains and hills do Corno do Boi in the east, and mountains do Bocelo in the south, where we find Megalithics rest like the dolmen of Forno dos Mouros and the \\"Pena da Moura\\" two round big rocks where are doubts and legends if it was the men who put the rocks there. These mountain systems are around 750 m altitude. They can locate Mount Campelo with 806 m and the mountain of Pilar with 801 m situated at the border of the province, and establishing superb views over the territory. The western areas of the municipality is around the 450 to 600 meters and the mountains becomes in little hills and valleys where the most of the population lives. Hydrography Although the river network of the municipality is characterized by small rivers with low flow, typical of a region of mountain peaks. In the Bocelo mountains have the head of the two major rivers of western Galicia: the Mandeo that slopes down to the Ria de Betanzos and Tambre flowing into the estuary of Muros and Noia. Historic heritage Sobrado Abbey A monastery is believed to have been founded on the site in the 10th century by the Benedictines. By the beginning of the 12th century it had been abandoned. In 1142, it was re-founded as a Cistercian monastery from Clairvaux. During the 12th and 13th centuries it flourished and was able to undertake the foundations of its own daughter house, Valdedios Abbey in Asturia. Sobrado was also given the supervision of Monfero Abbey after it joined the Cistercian Order. After a period of decline Sobrado was the first abbey in Galicia, in 1498, to join the Castilian Cistercian Congregation. The monumental new Baroque abbey church was dedicated in 1708. Most of the conventual buildings were also rebuilt at this time. The dissolution of the monasteries enforced by the government of Mendiz√°bal in 1835 put an end to the abbey, and the abandoned buildings fell into decay. In 1954 the Trappist monks of Viaceli Abbey in C√≥breces, west of Cantabria, began reconstruction, having already refounded and restored Huerta Abbey in 1929, and were able to resettle the monastery with a new Trappist community in 1966. Roman Camp of Cidadela the Roman Camp of Cidadela The camp is nestled on a plateau of 480 meters, is surrounded by the mountain of Serra da Corda, its height varies between 522 and 601 meters. The presence of the camp in this place is due to strategic reasons, such as controlling step the Roman road to \\"Lucus Augusti (Lugo). The camp is rectangular with rounded corners. Its dimensions are 172 meters long by 140 feet wide, equivalent to an area of 2.40 ha, which are appropriate measures for the training of a military unit five. This whole camp is protected by a wall and a moat and a number of control points located near the camp . The materials found at the camp are numerous coins ranging from the time of Domitian (86) to Claudius II (270), a wide range of glass, bronze, iron objects, construction of pottery, etc.. Natural heritage Sobrado has a rich natural heritage, with numerous rivers and lakes, one wet area declared of European interest, apart from numerous forest full of oak, chestnut, birch, etc. The Lagoon The Lagoon of Sobrado The Lagoon of Sobrado has an artificial origin, built between 1500 and 1530 by monks damming the waters of some small rivers to irrigate lawns, move mills or dispose of fishing . The lagoon has a circular shape that covers an approximate area of 10 hectares, with an average depth of 1.5 meters to 4.5 meters high. It is situated at an altitude of 510 meters and has an annual change in their level of about 20 centimeters. It is a good representation of the lake ecosystem in which they live frogs, ducks, dragonflies, otters and cormorants and other species. Sobrado Lagoon is the only place in the Iberian Peninsula is registered in the alga \\"Nitella-Flexilis. Framing the gap we can see the typical tree-gallery forest-birch, alder, ash, willow ... to give way to the Galician agricultural landscape composed of fields, crops and forests. In addition to providing shelter and food for marsh wildlife, this place we moved to a studio and entertainment. The \\"Casa do Gado\\" Oak forest is a beautiful oak forest over the town of Sobrado where there are also chestnut, mistletoe, birch, pine etc. In the 1980s a film was shot in the forest. The film is called the Living Forest(el bosque animado) and is based on a novel of a Galician writer Wenceslao Fernandez Florez The 2nd oldest oak in Galicia Situated in the village of Portacal (Cumbraos), is an oak ranked as the 2nd oldest in Galicia according to the SGHN Galicia (Galician Society of Natural History).

The script was primarily by Peter Sellars and Tom Luddy, and was originally assigned to Norman Mailer. It is not a typical cinematic adaptation of Shakespeare's eponymous tragedy, although some lines from the play are used in the film. Only three characters ‚Äì Lear, Cordelia and Edgar ‚Äì are common to both, and only Act I, scene 1 is given a conventional cinematic treatment in that two or three people actually engage in relatively meaningful dialogue. King Lear is set in and around Nyon, Vaud, Switzerland, where Godard went to primary school. While many of Godard's films are concerned with the invisible aspects of cinematography, the outward action of the film is centred on William Shakespeare Junior the Fifth, who is attempting to restore his ancestor's plays in a world where most of human civilization‚Äîand more specifically culture‚Äîhas been lost after the Chernobyl catastrophe. Rather than reproducing a performance of Shakespeare's play, the film is more concerned with the issues raised by the text, and symbolically explores the relationships between power and virtue, between fathers and daughters, words and images. The film deliberately does not use conventional Hollywood filmmaking techniques which make a film 'watchable', but instead seeks to alienate and baffle its audience in the manner of Bertolt Brecht. Cast (in order of appearance) The film itself contains no credits or credit sequence at all, although there is a cast list on the packaging insert. * Menahem Golan as himself (voice off, uncredited) * Jean-Luc Godard as himself (voice off) * Tom Luddy (voice off, uncredited) * Norman Mailer as himself * Kate Mailer as herself * Peter Sellars as William Shakespeare Jr. the Fifth, a descendant of William Shakespeare * Burgess Meredith as Don Learo * Molly Ringwald as Cordelia * Suzanne Lanza as a goblin (uncredited) * Mich√®le P√©tin as a goblin (uncredited) * Leos Carax as Edgar * Julie Delpy as Virginia * Jean-Luc Godard as Professor Pluggy * Freddy Buache as Grigori Kozintsev (\\"Professor Quentin\\") * Woody Allen as Mr. Alien Adaptation of the text Script Statue of Shakespeare in Leicester Square The film script, mostly written by Peter Sellars and Tom Luddy, includes only a few of Shakespeare's lines from King Lear, and these are often fragmentary and generally not heard in the order as they appear in the play. Many of the lines are not actually spoken by the characters on-screen (i.e. diegetically), but are often heard in voice-over, or spoken by another character or voice, perhaps almost incomprehensibly, or barely whispered, repeated, echoed. Extracts from three of Shakespeare's sonnets, numbers 47, 138 and 60 are heard during the film. There is also a single line from Hamlet: \\"Inside me there is a kind of fighting which will not let me sleep.\\" (Act V, scene 2:5) :\\"[This] film, not at all tragic, is intellectualized and does not offer the [casual] spectator the possibility of full understanding. As the filmmaker makes clear in the film, he does not intend to give it a comprehensive treatment, since it is only an approach, a study, which is obviously partial. There is nothing definitive about the text; it is constantly interrupted, discontinuous, a disordered mix of images, a true chaos...\\" Literary sources Apart from lines from Shakespeare's play, extracts from a number of modern literary sources are also heard during the film: some are spoken by an on-screen character, some in voice-over on the deliberately confusing soundtrack. They are listed in the order in which they appear in the film. # \\"Be sure...\\" Robert Bresson (1975). Notes sur le cin√©matographe. Paris: √âditions Gallimard.

It has dozens of allusions to other works and quotes from famous texts [...] Each quotation, analogy, demands from the spectator great extra-textual knowledge. It is as if Godard concentrated centuries of art and culture in this film, reviewing all of history [...] What is derived from the [play's] text are only a few characters, vaguely associated with those of Shakespeare, and some speeches totally out of context.\\" Synopsis Timings are taken from the original MGM DVD.  Opening sequence  The film begins with a sequence of extended inter-titles: 'The Cannon Group / Bahamas', 'A Picture Shot In The Back', 'King Lear / Fear and Loathing', 'King Lear / A study', 'An Approach'. A three-way telephone conversation is heard between the film's producer, Menahem Golan, Godard, and Tom Luddy. Golan complains about how long Godard is taking to make the film and insists that it must be ready for the 1987 Cannes Film Festival. At the Hotel du Rivage in Nyon, Norman Mailer discusses his new script for King Lear with his daughter Kate Mailer, and why the characters have Mafia-like names like Don Learo, Don Gloucestro. He wants to go back to America. They sip orange juice. The whole scene is then repeated.  William Shakespeare Jr.  William Shakespeare Junior (Will Jr.) sits at a table in the deserted hotel restaurant, overlooking Lake Geneva. There are some red tulips on the table. He wonders why he has been chosen to make this film, rather than a better-known director (\\"...some gentleman from Moscow or Beverly Hills. Why don't they just order some goblin to shoot this twisted fairy tale?\\"). In voice-over, Godard reads extracts from Robert Bresson's Notes sur le cin√©matographe. Will Jr. imagines 'auteurs' who could have made this film, like Marcel Pagnol, Kenji Mizoguchi, Fran√ßois Truffaut (\\"No\\"), Georges Franju, Robert Bresson, Pier Paulo Pasolini, Fritz Lang, Georges Melies, Jaques Tati, Jean Cocteau. Junior wonders about Luchino Visconti (assistant to Jean Renoir), and about Auguste Renoir's attraction to young girls in later years. The name of Mr Alien is heard in voice-over with an image of Sergei Eisenstein editing on his death-bed. Will Jr. is now in a hotel bedroom, looking at an album with images of Orson Welles, Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring. Power and Virtue (inter-title) Rembrandt's Saint Paul, Rubens' Young Woman Looking Down,Young Woman Looking Down, (Study for the Head of Saint Apollonia), early 1628. Artnet.com. Retrieved January 18, 2017. Rembrandt's The Return of the Prodigal Son. At the same time, in voice-over, Cordelia reads from sonnet 47: and Lear - foreshadowing the last scene of the play - mourns the death of his daughter. Seen at a restaurant table with yellow flowers, Will Jr. explains in voice-over that he is on duty for the Cannon Cultural Division: and then there is NO THING (inter-title). Everything had disappeared after the Chernobyl explosion. Saturn Devouring His Son by Goya. After a while everything came back: electricity, houses, cars‚Äîeverything except culture and William Junior. Emerging from a reed bed, he explains (in voice-over) that‚Äîby special arrangement with the Cannon Cultural Division and the Royal Library of Her Majesty, the Queen he was engaged to recover what had been lost, starting the works of his famous ancestor. In the restaurant, Will Jr. (very noisily slurping his soup) overhears Cordelia talking with a waiter. Learo interrupts, and Will Jr. realises that he is speaking lines from one of Shakespeare's lost plays. But Learo starts reminiscing about Bugsy Siegel and Meyer Lansky, two Jewish mobsters in Las Vegas. Lear reproves Cordelia for not having professed her love for him effusively enough, and says she will lose her inheritance (\\"You may mar your dollars\\"). Will Jr. goes to thank Cordelia (\\"my lady\\"), but Learo accuses him of \\"making a play for my girl\\", and silently leads her away. \\"Characters!\\" Goblins William Junior is seen walking in a wood. He begins writing in a notebook, silently followed by some well-dressed young people who mimic his actions. He seems not to notice them. He runs away towards someone, followed closely by the others. Will Jr. meets Edgar, \\"a man poorly dressed\\", and Virginia (who wasn't there). Edgar says they are in Aubonne/Los Angeles. Will Jr. learns about Pluggy, whose \\"research was moving in parallel lines to my own\\". Don Learo and Cordelia are in the hotel room\`(00:24:05). He dictates from Fried's book while she types (\\"Now, even if Lansky and I are as awesome...\\") She is very patient. Telexes arrive from his other daughters, and Lear reads their preposterous lines from Act I, scene 1. Cordelia sinks to the floor on hearing their words: \\"Then poor Cordelia.\\" NO THING. The music speeds up and sinks back to a dirge. The well-dressed young people from the woods appear on the hotel balcony. Will Jr in voice-over calls them goblins, \\"the secret agents of human memory.\\" Edgar, Will Jr. and Virginia who is picking up flowers, walk past a large red skip (00:31:13). Crow sound. Virginia picks up a white flower beside an apple tree. Express train sound. Sound of bells. Will Jr., engrossed in writing, suddenly looks up. On the hotel balcony, a goblin, invisible to Lear, taps him on the shoulder (while Will Jr. in voice-off speaks Lear's words, wondering who he is): breaking the fourth wall, the goblin says out loud, on screen, \\"Lear's shadow!\\". In the hotel bedroom, a maid opens the french windows and two goblins enter. The man chants the words \\"Abracadbra! Mao Tse-tung. Che Guevara,\\" and they disappear. The maid starts to change the bed sheets, but they are covered in blood. Will Jr. comes in, looking for Mr. Learo and stares aghast at the mess. Brief shot of Learo with Cordelia by the river in the woods. Plato's cave And then we are back in the half-finished house [in reality belonging to Anne-Marie Mi√©ville]. Pluggy mutters lines from sonnet 138. Will Jr. asks Pluggy about his research. \\"Just what are you aiming at, Professor?\\" Pluggy farts loudly in Will Jr.'s direction. Virginia explains cryptically that \\"When the professor farts, the mountains are trembling.\\" Fire scene inside the house/Plato's cave. Virginia is ironing Cordelia's nightgown (she wears it in the Joan of Arc sequence at 01:07:00). NO THING (inter- title). Music starts slowly. Edgar lights a little bonfire with sticks and paper he gathered up on the way in. Will Jr: \\"It is born, and it is burnt. It begins from the thing it ends. At the same time.\\" Music accelerates to nearly full speed. \\"Then what is it? (Looking straight at Virginia) TELL ME THE NAME! Look, no names, no lines. No lines, no story!\\" Virginia: \\"To name things makes the Professor pee.\\" (or just 'P') Edgar: \\"Poor things. Who are they, to need a name? To exist?\\" Discussion of colour. Red and yellow tulips. Sonnet 47 in voice-over again. (00:41:15) Cordelia stands at a mirror, wiping her face clean. A maid brings a breakfast tray into the hotel apartment. Cordelia follows her unnoticed from the bathroom and watches while the maid taps on the cups and plates. (Viviane Forrester's \\"A violent silence for silence of Cordelia...\\"). Nothing. No Thing. Seagull squawk. Will Jr (in voice-over): \\"...But everything which conspires and organises itself around her silence, that wants to silence her silence, this produces violence.\\" Cordelia is suddenly very aware of something, glancing round. Sudden coincidence of son+image as one of the goblins knocks her ass against the table with a crash. Another goblin, dressed like Jean-Paul Belmondo in Breathless, looks at a book. He lights her cigarette (with a lighter, like in the fire scene). But the goblins are suddenly gone, and Cordelia picks up the book: more images. Will Jr. is sitting on the rocks and getting completely soaked by the waves. Power and Virtue (intertitle). No Thing in voice-over. Brief shot of Learo arriving at restaurant table. Edgar, walking by the river in the woods, finds an empty film can in the river. Two goblins snatch it from him. NO THING. Music speeds up.  \\"Snakes!\\"  Pluggy's editing studio. He is photocopying his hand. Will Jr. enters. Godard appears to have disguised one of the central aspects of his film so well that almost every writer who mentions it does so with a sense of bafflement and bewilderment: namely, the shots illuminated by a bare light bulb of toy plastic dinosaurs and other animals in a cardboard box. These shots are intercut with the montage sequence described below. At 00:48:18, we see a plastic red dinosaur and some other animals. Will Jr. asks, \\"What's it all for, Professor? Please?\\" And Pluggy replies, \\"The Last Judgement.\\" Pluggy seems to be referring to the biblical passage in the Book of Revelation which describes the war in heaven. Lest we mistake the toy dinosaurs in the box, a few moments later (00:48:34) Virginia (off-screen) cries \\"Snakes!\\" The French word for 'snake' is 'serpent', the old English and French name for dragon, and the Wagnerian equivalent is 'Wurm'. Revelation, chapter 12 tells how the great red dragon is thrown down to earth, and v. 9 gives some of its names: dragon, serpent, devil, Satan. \\"Do not come between the dragon and his wrath,\\" says Lear several times during the film. One of the most famous cinematic dragons is perhaps the scene-stealing star of Part I of Die Nibelungen. The film featured in Histoire(s) du cin√©ma, Godard's next huge project after King Lear: \\"Short of fusing himself into the celluloid, Godard does what he can to immerse himself in cinema's promised immortality, bathing like Fritz Lang's Siegfried in the blood of the beast.\\"  Montage  \\"The image is a pure creation of the soul...\\" - Pierre Reverdy In this highly compressed and cinematically meaningful sequence (00:49:00), Godard demonstrates the technique of montage, which allows a film-maker to bring two or more opposing realities into a new association. The scene takes place in Professor Pluggy's cutting room (or editing suite). The images (starting from 00:49:04) are: # Henry Fuseli: Shipwreck of Odysseus. # Unidentified image. # Film clip of a female face in close-up. # Giotto: The Mourning of Christ (detail). Fresco in the Scrovegni Chapel (Arena chapel), Padua. # Film still of a notorious shot from Luis Bu√±uel's Un chien andalou. # Fuseli: Lady Macbeth Sleepwalking # The front cover (detail) of Tex Avery by Patrick Brion, published in France in 1986 while King Lear was still in production. It shows a reversed still shot of the wolf from Tex Avery's 1949 cartoon Little Rural Riding Hood. # Unidentified painting of a young man kissing a reclining woman's neck. Cordelia is seen lying on her bed, wearing the nightgown which Virginia was ironing, with the book of Dor√© pictures. Goya's Judith and Holofernes, illuminated by a candle flame (00:50:43) Another shot of the animals in the cardboard box. Brief shots of what seems to be a cinema audience in silhouette. The shadowy figure standing beside the editing monitors lights a sparkler and turns out to be Edgar. Pluggy asks him if he has finished \\"our construction\\" yet. Edgar hands the sparkler ('cierge magique' in French, lit. 'magic candle') to Will Jr., and goes off to ask Virginia. \\"Let's go,\\" says Pluggy, and Will Jr. asks if he can bring some friends. In the restaurant in the evening, Learo gets angry with Will Jr., while Cordelia buries her head in her hands. Shot of a white horse. Will Jr. (off-screen) reads more Forrester. Learo buries his head in his hands. Will Jr. gives Cordelia a sparkler. Learo talks about \\"God's spies\\". Cut to the earlier daytime shots of Will Jr. in the restaurant, reflecting on his inability to control his characters (or actors?), and how Lear and Cordelia respectively represent Power and Virtue. A Picture Shot In The Back (intertitle). In a small cinema or screening room (00:59:50). A journalist from The New York Times asks Pluggy about his new invention. Professor Kozintsev arrives. Pluggy asks him, \\"Really? You found it, really?\\" \\"It all just happened by chance,\\" Kozintsev replies, \\"in King Solomon's Mines.\\" Discussion of cinema. An empty cinema/screening room. Learo and Cordelia enter, and Will Jr. goes to sit between them. \\"Peace, Mr. Shakespeare. Come not between the dragon and his wrath,\\" says Learo. Will goes to sit somewhere else, and his chair tips up. On the soundtrack we hear a scene from Kozintsev's King Lear. Back again in the hotel bedroom Cordelia, wearing her nightgown, acts the part of The Maid of Orl√©ans in a remake of a scene from Robert Bresson's 1962 film The Trial of Joan of Arc. The goblins diegetically speak the lines of Joan's inquisitors. Endings We see a copy of Virginia Woolf's The Waves lying on the pebbles by the lake. Inter- titles: 'King Lear / A Clearing'. On the soundtrack we hear the noise of an express train passing at speed. 'NO THING'. Clear, joyous birdsong. Easter bells. The first image. Winding back time to zero. J. S. Bach, St. Matthew Passion, opening chorus. Bells. Pluggy lying on the ground surrounded by flowers. \\"Now I understand that Pluggy's sacrifice was not in vain.\\" \\"Now I understood through his work the words of St. Paul: 'The image will re-appear at the time of resurrection.'\\" Will Junior is seen lying on the ground, as if dead. Shot of the empty film can which Edgar picked out of the river earlier. Edgar spools up some film. Edgar exits left, pursued by ~~a bear~~ Will Jr. with an elephant gun. By the lake (01:17:00). All five main characters (Virginia, Edgar, Lear, Cordelia, and William Junior) together for the only time in the film. \\"The dawn of our first image\\" coinciding with shot of a white horse. The final paragraph of The Waves is heard (01:19:50). The goblins, yelling and uttering wild cries, pursue Learo as he walks with the gun towards Cordelia leading the horse, pushing and shoving him. Cordelia is seen on the rocks, Learo with the gun, facing away from camera. Shot in the back, like many of Godard's images. How does Cordelia die? No shot is heard. Mr. Alien's editing studio. Mr Alien stitches the film together with needle and thread. He reads Shakespeare sonnet 60 (01:24:50). Shot of the white horse again in slo-mo. Lear's final lines read by Ruth Maleczech and recorded by Peter Sellers (along with David Warrilow) in Philip Glass's studio in New York. A STUDY (inter-title). Seagull squawk. End. Soundtrack \\"Hide the ideas, but so that people find them. The most important will be the most hidden.\\" The sound engineer was , who worked on most of Godard's major films from Lettre √† Freddy Buache to Allemagne ann√©e 90 neuf z√©ro. Shakespeare's original play is full of lines containing animal imagery. In King Lear Godard fills the soundtrack with a barrage of semi-identifiable animal noises: one of the most noticeable is the shrill and raucous call of a crow. This is a recurring sound in Godard's films, including Allemagne ann√©e 90 neuf z√©ro and JLG/JLG. A detail of Wheatfield with Crows, one of Van Gogh‚Äôs very last paintings, appears towards the end of King Lear. Discussing JLG/JLG, Nora M. Alter remarks: \\"Not only is the crow conspicuously absent on the screen, but its sounds are conspicuously disjunct, too loud to be part of the landscape. This sequence, sometimes with the muttering voice of the narrator superimposed, is repeated at irregular intervals[...] I want to suggest that, consistent with much of Godard's work, [this sequence] does not hierarchize the aural and the visual. On the contrary, it fuses the two together as a sound image, or rebus...\\" In many of Godard's films, the aural and the visual are conceived to be perceived as one, a son+image (sound+picture). This is a type of audio-visual collage made up of overlapping or repeated film clips, written or spoken poetry, philosophy, high and low literature, as well as paintings and visual citations, which function as a rebus. Godard's later films break the conventions that film dialogue should generally be audible and meaningful and progress the plot. Although King Lear uses Dolby stereo to good effect, vision and sound often do not complement each other, with the effect of making viewers continually question what they are seeing or hearing. Music The music exemplifies two of Bresson's aphorisms in Notes sur le cin√©matographe: \\"No music as accompaniment, support or reinforcement. No music at all. (Except, of course, the music played by visible instruments)\\"; and \\"The noises must become music.\\" Although barely recognisable, much of the music is taken from Beethoven's last completed work, the String Quartet No. 16, Op. 135. Ever since Godard's 1963 short film Le Nouveau Monde, Beethoven's Gro√üe Fuge and final quartet had provided a lasting challenge to the moral compromises and the empty banalities of the moment. In King Lear, Godard slowed the music down and electronically manipulated it so that the only easily identifiable extract is from the second movement (in 3/4 time, from around bar 120). At the very start of the film the music is heard playing at about half speed, but most of the time it is played back even slower as a low background dirge. The passage only reaches the proper pitch two or three times, with a swift accelerando at crucial moments of NO THING and then collapses again as swiftly: when Cordelia sinks down on the balcony with Learo (wearing red) uncomfortably close behind her (00:30:40), and when the goblins snatch the empty film can from Edgar's hands beside the river (00:46:50). The opening chorus of J. S. Bach's St. Matthew Passion is heard during the reversed stop-motion sequence of \\"creating\\" the flowers (01:13:05), and at the death of Professor Pluggy (01:14:20), similarly slowed down. Judith Wilt prefaced her article on Virginia Woolf's The Waves with this passage from Moments of Being: :\\"From this I reach what I might call a philosophy ... that the whole world is a work of art. ... Hamlet, or a Beethoven quartet is the truth about this vast mass that we call the world. But there is no Shakespeare, there is no Beethoven; certainly and emphatically there is no God; we are the words; we are the music; we are the thing itself.\\" Production Although Norman Mailer had written a complete script, Godard didn't use it. Mailer & his daughter, Kate Mailer, arrived in Nyon in September 1986 and did around three hours' shooting. He was paid $500,000. The scene with Woody Allen was shot at his editing suite in the Brill Building, Manhattan in January 1987. The main part of the shoot took place in Switzerland in March 1987 in Nyon and Rolle, a few kilometers apart. Godard had also accepted a contract to make some short commercial films for Closed, a brand of jeans by Marith√© and Fran√ßois Girbaud. These commercial videos were shot in March 1987 at the same time as King Lear, and the same actors/models in the commercials also appear in the film as the goblins. \\"\\"What sets me apart from lots of people in the cinema,\\" Godard has said, \\"is that money is part of the screenplay, in the story of the film, and that the film is part of money, like mother-child, father-daughter.\\" The ads use similar locations and a similar montage technique, and the titles some of the jeans ads make the connections obvious: Tulipes, Fer a repasser (Ironing, lit. 'Smoothing iron') and King Lear. One of the shots (the models/goblins climbing over the hotel balcony railing) is used in both the commercial and the main film of King Lear. Release King Lear premiered at Cannes on May 17, 1987, and, after a brief two-week run in the US, it did not appear in cinemas for another fifteen years. It was re-released in 2002 by a French distribution company, Bodega Films, but the company and Godard were sued by Viviane Forrester, the author of one of the literary quotations used in the film, for infringing her copyright. Godard and Bodega were both fined ‚Ç¨5,000 and King Lear was withdrawn after two years.Le Monde des Livres (in French), June 11, 2004, p. v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released a DVD for the Italian market only, with unintelligible subtitles which are often only a vague approximation of some of the lines and names mentioned in the film. The DVD seems to have been generally available since 2013, possibly after Roger Ebert's mention of it on his website. Reception The film has an approval rating of 50% on the ratings aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.King Lear at RottenTomatoes.com Desson Howe of the Washington Post criticised Godard for inappropriately imposing his unique style on Shakespeare's work - \\"Where the playwright values clarity and poetry, Godard seems to go for obfuscation and banality. Shakespeare aims for universality, while Godard seeks to devalue everything.\\" - whilst reserving praise for the editing and cinematography. Also commenting in The Washington Post, Hal Hinson classified the film as a \\"labored, not terribly funny practical joke\\", \\"infuriating, baffling, challenging and fascinating\\" in which Godard \\"trashes his own talent\\". Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times, however, called it, \\"a work of certified genius\\", and Richard Brody, writing in the New Yorker, described it and Godard's In Praise of Love as, relatively, \\"great films that are even more aesthetically radical than his earlier ones\\"; In terms of the film genre of adaptations, Brody has called the film his \\"favorite movie of all time.\\" The New York Times review by Vincent Canby compared it unfavourably to the rest of Godard's oeuvre as \\"tired, familiar and out of date\\", remarking that the few lines of Shakespeare delivered in the play overpower his dialogue, making it \\"seem much punier than need be\\". Nonetheless, Canby praises the acting as \\"remarkably good under terrible circumstances\\". Canby also called the film \\"sad and embarrassing\\" and was quoted by Keith Harrison in the introduction to his Bakhtinian Polyphony in Godard's King Lear. Harrison cites the critical responses of Peter S. Donaldson, Alan Walworth and Anthony R. Guneratne for their sustained coherence of analysis of King Lear, and discusses the film in terms of Mikhail Bakhtin's interrelated concepts of dialogism, the carnivalesque, heteroglossia, the chronotope, co-authoring, polyglossia, inter-illumination, refraction, unfinalizability, and polyphony, to show that \\"Godard's autobiographical and densely fragmented re-creation of Shakespeare's King Lear is carefully shaped, meaningful, and, ultimately, compelling in its multi- voiced unity.\\" See also *Uroboros *Self-reference Notes and references Notes References Sources   * Part 1, pp. 1-41¬∑Part 2, pp. 44-77¬∑Part 3, pp. 78-107.

He was captured by communist forces on December 11, 1945 in Munich in Allied occupied Germany following the war and tried alongside other Serbian collaborationist leaders in 1946. He was found guilty of collaborating with Reinhard Heydrich and Heinrich Himmler and other German officials and executed in Belgrade. Early life Dragomir (Dragi) Jovanoviƒá was born on 27 June 1902 in Po≈æarevac, Kingdom of Serbia to Ljubomir and Vilma Jovanoviƒá (n√©e Dra≈°koci). Jovanoviƒá was married and had one child. He was a Nazi sympathizer before the outbreak of World War II. His links to German intelligence services dated back to the mid-1930s. On 10 May 1939 Dragomir went to the Berghof near Berchtesgaden to meet with Reinhard Heydrich, Heinrich Himmler and Karl Wolff World War II Mayor of Belgrade On 17 April 1941, the day Yugoslavia surrendered to the Axis powers, Jovanoviƒá left the town of Gornji Milanovac and went to Belgrade. The following day, he was received by Gestapo officers Karl Kraus and Hans Helm. The two suggested that he reorganize the Belgrade police and take control of the city's government. The German field commander in Belgrade, Colonel Ernst Moritz von Kaisenberg, then appointed Jovanoviƒá to the position of extraordinary commissar for the city. As mayor, Jovanoviƒá proposed that Belgrade be divided into sixteen boroughs and two commissariats and that the local police be used to quell anti-German acts in the city. The Germans accepted this plan. The Belgrade police was organized in mid-May 1941 and grew to a size of 878 police officers and 240 agents by the following month. That summer, Jovanoviƒá was appointed chief of Serbian State Security (, SDB) by SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer und Generalleutnant der Polizei (SS-General of Police) August Meyszner. The SDB assumed the administration of the Serbian State Guard (Srpska dr≈æavna stra≈æa, SDS). In early July, the Germans ordered Jovanoviƒá to convert the former 18th Infantry army barracks of the Royal Yugoslav Army into the Banjica concentration camp. Banjica held 23,697 inmates throughout the war, 3,849 of whom perished. According to the post-war testimony of the camp's administrator, Svetozar Vujkoviƒá, Jovanoviƒá saved countless Serb civilians from being executed as German hostages by swapping them with Roma prisoners. In his own post-war testimony, Jovanoviƒá recounted an incident in which he recognized a wounded Yugoslav prisoner of war as a Jew. He claimed to have singled the officer out and reported him to the Germans, who arrested him and took him to Banjica, where he was shot. Beginning in mid-1942, Jovanoviƒá provided financial aid to the Chetniks of Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá from his own personal fund. By late 1943, he was working as a Chetnik agent within the Serbian collaborationist government. In mid-August 1944, Jovanoviƒá, Mihailoviƒá and Nediƒá secretly met in the village of Ra≈æana, where Nediƒá agreed to give one-hundred million dinars for wages and to request from the Germans arms and ammunition for Mihailoviƒá. Escape, capture and death Jovanoviƒá left Belgrade in early October 1944, alongside other Serbian collaborationist leaders. He was captured following the war and tried as part of the Belgrade Process in 1946. He was found guilty of collaborating with the Germans and was executed in Belgrade on 17 July 1946.

Ebonie was an NCAA All-American sprinter at the University of Houston; producing the fourth fastest 200 meters (22.32) in the world during 2007. By virtue of her sixth-place finish (400 meters) at the 2008 US Olympic Trials, Ebonie earned a position on the Olympic Team as a member of the 1600-meter relay squad. Kalyn Floyd was also a sprinter on the UH track team.  Of further note  The 79-year legacy of Detroit-Mackenzie High School includes two alumni who competed in the Olympic Games.
