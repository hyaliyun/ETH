He was known for his work in general topology and regulated functions. During World War II, he worked as part of a group of five mathematicians, recruited by Wilhelm Fenner, and which included Ernst Witt, Alexander Aigner, Oswald Teichmueller and Johann Friedrich Schultze, and lead by Wolfgang Franz, to form the backbone of the new mathematical research department in the late 1930s, which would eventually be called: Section IVc of Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht (abbr. OKW/Chi).TICOM reports DF-187 A-G and DF-176, ‘European Axis Signal Intelligence in World War II’ vol 2 He also worked as a cryptanalyst, on the initial breaking of the most difficult cyphers. He also researched and developed cryptography theory. Life Born in Munich, George Aumann initially considered a career as a civil servant. From 1925, Aumann studied mathematics and physics at the Ludwig-Maximilian-University of Munich, among others with Professor Constantin Carathéodory and Professor Heinrich Tietze. He was promoted in 1931 to Doctor of Philosophy with a thesis titled: contributions to the theory of decomposition spaces (German:Beiträge zur Theorie der Zerlegungsräume) In 1933 he habilitated twice, at the Technical University of Munich, and at the University of Munich (with different degrees of postdoctoral dissertation). In 1934–35 he was appointed a Rockefeller scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton N.J. In 1936 he became an extraordinary professor at the Goethe University in Frankfurt. At the beginning of the war, he was conscripted for military service Appeals to a full professorship failed several times because he was regarded as politically unreliable among the Nazis Ministry of Education. In all these years his wife was an indispensable, prudent and energetic support to him. In 1949 he became full professor at the University of Würzburg and in 1950 at the University of Munich. In 1960 he moved to a professorship at the Technical University of Munich. After the war, he received an apology. In 1954 he published Real Functions, a nine-chapter textbook on real analysis. In a review, Paul Halmos said \\"The quality, quantity, organization, and exposition of its contents, together with the fact that much of the material in it has not been available hitherto in book form, serve to make it a recommended part of the library of every modern analyst.\\" The text was re-printed in 1969. He also dealt with conformal illustrations, properties of complex polynomials, band theory and cluster theory. Aumann also wrote a three-dimensional analysis textbook with Otto Haupt and a three-volume mathematics textbook for engineers. In 1958 Aumann became a full member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences In 1977 the University of Erlangen awarded Aumann an Honorary Doctor of Science degree, Doctor rerum naturalium honoris causa. Contact and neighborhood relations In 1970 Aumann contributed to the theory of binary relations with a generalization of the set membership relation ∈. The elements of a universe U form the domain of this relation while the range is the power set on U, denoted P(U). A contact relation C with this domain and range is expressed in terms of the calculus of relations using compositions: :C^T bar{C}  subseteq  i bar{C} , where CT is the converse of C, i is the converse of set membership, and bar{C} is the complementary relation to C.G.

Career Born about 1418, the son of Thomas Fenn, a leading citizen of Great Yarmouth, and grandson of the MP Hugh Fenn, he may have had some education at Cambridge University and at Gray's Inn. By 1444 he was an official in the Exchequer and in 1450 as clerk to John Somer, an Auditor, had to report to Parliament on the state of the nation's finances.Some sources say he attended as MP for Yarmouth, but this is debatable. As a royal official, he took charge of properties falling into Crown hands. For example, in 1450 he was keeper of lands at Wratting forfeited by William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk and in 1451 of lands at Swaffham. On John Somer's death in 1453, Fenn was appointed to succeed him as Auditor by John Tiptoft, 1st Earl of Worcester, the Lord High Treasurer of England.To take over the post, he may have had to support Somer's children. At the age of about 35, he became one of the most senior officials in the department and was well placed, over and above his official business, to help friends, neighbours and relations in their legal and financial affairs. Two influential Norfolk connections of his were the Paston family and Sir John Fastolf, a possible relation for whom he stood guarantor in 1452. His name occurs frequently in the Paston Letters as using his knowledge and contacts to advance that family's interests, with Margaret PastonWife of John Paston (died 1466) noting that: he is called right feythfull and trosty to his frendes that trost hym. Another service was to be executor of a will, acting for instance for Sir Geoffrey Boleyn in 1463 and for the sheriff of Essex, Sir John Clay, in 1464. In addition to his responsibilities at Westminster, he was appointed escheator of Norfolk and Suffolk in 1456 and a justice of the peace for Norfolk from 1457, as well as sitting on other Norfolk commissions. The victory of the Yorkist faction in 1460 ended these posts in East Anglia but enhanced his standing in the Exchequer, where in 1463 he was promoted to the major office of Under-Treasurer of England. When at a dinner next year the Lord Mayor of London, Sir Matthew Phillip, was not given the seat of honour and walked out insulted, it was a delegation led by the Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir John Say, and including the Under-Treasurer, Hugh Fenn, that went to Guildhall to apologise. From 1464 he started attending meetings of the Privy Council and remained active in national affairs for the rest of his life, being appointed to a commission to survey royal property in the Windsor area on 24 February 1476, only days before his death. Working in London, he had chambers in Holborn, properties in Smithfield and Kentish Town and a house with land in Hackney. However, in common with many pursuing successful urban careers, he also invested in the prime status symbol of rural landholdings and their associated rights. For example, by about 1466 he was lord of the two manors of Herringby, known as Herringby Spencers and Herringby Fenns, and was patron of the church. Another enterprise was acquiring a wardship, with the right to choose the spouse of an under-age heir, which in 1466 he did in partnership with William Essex (later one of his executors)Grandfather of Sir William Essex. for Nicholas Carew.Possibly the son of Sir Thomas Carew of Mohuns Ottery. A further area was advowsons, where in 1468 he acquired the right of presentation to the Suffolk churches of Ufford and Combs together with the chantry of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the church of St Andrew at Brundish. In 1471 he bought the patronage of Castle Acre Priory. Family and legacy He made his will on 24 February 1476,Wills Proved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, 1383-1558 No 477 Fenne, atte Fenne, Hugh; Haryngby, Norfolk; West Smythfeld, etc, London. 32 Wattys asking to be buried next to his mother's tomb in the chancel of Herringby church, and presumably died a few days later. He left a widow called Eleanor and one child, a daughter called Margaret. She was already the wife of Sir George Nevill, heir to the 3rd Baron Bergavenny, and had the first four of their eventual eight children. His widow lived until 28 September 1485 and was buried at St Bartholomew-the-Great, Smithfield. The first concern of his will was taking care of his widow, his daughter and his grandchildren. Then there were bequests to friends and relations, to the parish church (100 marks for the roof) and to Norwich Cathedral (500 marks for the steeple), but then mainly to founding and endowing a charity in Herringby. The two manors he owned there, with other lands and rights, were to be settled on an almshouse, sometimes called Herringby College, as its source of income. It was to have a master, three priests, eight poor people and two servants, all overseen by a committee of county notables. Beyond the social purpose of sheltering indigent people, the prime purpose of the establishment was religious, for as bedesmen the inmates would say daily prayers for the soul of Hugh Fenn while the priests would celebrate masses for him. Like many religious foundations in England, it did not survive the upheavals under King Henry VIII. Its assets were first appropriated by Cardinal Wolsey to fund a charitable project in Ipswich, which collapsed with his fall from power. Then in 1546 the site and all its lands in Herringby were sold by the Crown to Sir Thomas Clere. An interesting feature of his will for that time is that he named some of his books and specified who they were to go to. For example, his Lives of the Saints was to go to his wife and on her death to his granddaughter Elizabeth. To his eldest grandson George, future 5th Baron Bergavenny, he left the primer he wrote out himself, his psalter, and his copy of De Regimine Principum.This might be the version by Thomas Hoccleve compiled for King Henry V.

The case was a scandal in contemporary Netherlands, where it caused a debate on whether the allegations were accurate or a political conspiracy against her father. It is the subject of research and fiction, a novel and a play. She was the daughter of the noble and minister Onno Zwier van Haren (1713-1779) and Sara Hüls (1718-1793), and married in 1760 to the lawyer Willem van Hogendorp (1735-1784). In 1760, Carolina Wilhelmina van Haren and her invalid sister Betty privately accused their father of sexual abuse. They were encouraged by her betrothed, because his family refused to consent to the marriage unless her father resigned his post as cabinet minister. In 1761, her father took the matter to court to clear his name, which made the case public and declared himself innocent on the grounds that his daughters were too unattractive for him to molest them. He was acquitted from incest because his daughters refused to testify, but the scandal still forced him to resign. Carolina Wilhelmina van Haren was disinherited and broke all contact with her family. She often attended the court of the House of Orange and became a known Orangist. When she separated from her spouse in 1773, she was given an allowance from the House of Orange.

She exhibited portraits, still lifes and landscapes at two dozen venues in Europe and the U.S., and institutions including the Metropolitan Museum of Art acquired her works. She was acclaimed in publications including the New York Times and The International Studio. She also earned praise for her collection of paintings by her mentor, William Merritt Chase, with whom she traveled in Europe and California. She was considered the Chase pupil \\"who best assimilated his technique and verve.\\"  Biography  Annie Lang was born in Philadelphia on September 8, 1885, the second eldest of seven children of the Philadelphia attorney James Traquair Lang (1858-1920) and Winona Barker Sewell Lang (1862-1928). Among her paternal ancestors were the stone carver James Traquair (1756-1811), who worked with the architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe; Thomas Traquair (1790-1824), a lieutenant in the War of 1812; and the engraver George Shortread Lang (1799-1877). Annie Lang studied at the Public Industrial Art School, the Philadelphia School of Design for Women, Chase's summer art school on Long Island in Southampton's Shinnecock Hills, and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where she won scholarships for travel in Europe. Her teachers, in addition to Chase, included Elliot Daingerfield, Cecilia Beaux and Thomas Anshutz. Around 1911, she moved to Manhattan. She traveled widely during the summers, painting views of North Carolina, Venice, Florence, Bruges and Carmel, California. She posed for portraits by Chase (one belongs to the Philadelphia Museum of Art), and she painted him (one of her portraits of Chase hangs at the Metropolitan Museum). Among her other sitters were the arts educator J. Liberty Tadd, the artist Helen Thurlow, the actress Maude Adams, the writer Mary Hunter Austin and the painter and poet Countess Gabriella Fabbricotti. Lang, although she was bereft after Chase's death in 1916 (she was his longtime mistress, according to her descendants), continued to paint overseas. In 1918, after a yearlong trip through Puerto Rico, Cuba and the Dominican Republic, Lang returned to New York with plans to volunteer at battlefield canteens in France. While preparing for the trip, she developed fatal bronchopneumonia (caused by the Spanish flu), and died on November 8.  Achievements  At age 18, Annie Lang began displaying her artworks at Philadelphia venues including Wanamaker's flagship store (1903), the Art Club of Philadelphia (1904, 1907), Philadelphia Water Color Club (1907), American Art Society (1907), T Square Club (1908), and Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1911, 1912). Her other Pennsylvania venues included the Carnegie International in Pittsburgh (1911, 1913, 1914) and the State Normal School in West Chester, Pa. (1915). In New York, she showed at the New York Water Color Club (1904), American Water Color Society (1907), Architectural League (1908), National Academy of Design (1912, 1914), National Arts Club (1917) and Knoedler galleries (1917). Knoedler also showed her collection of Chase's works. At the Panama-Pacific International Exposition (1915), she received a silver medal for her portraits of women in kimonos and Venice views. Among her other U.S. venues were the Art Institute of Chicago (1912, 1913, 1916), Corcoran Gallery of Art (1912-1913), Muncie Art Association (1913), St. Louis Art Museum (1913) and Art Association of Richmond, Indiana (1913). The American Federation of Arts included her portrait of Chase in a traveling show (1913-1914). Overseas she exhibited at the Roman Art Exposition (1911) and the Anglo-American Exposition in London (1914). In 1910, Chase predicted that her \\"remarkable ability\\" boded well for the future of American art. The New York Times praised her ability to execute \\"evanescent gradations of color with such authority.\\" The International Studio ranked her acquisitions of Chase's paintings as \\"in all probability the finest private collection of his works in this country\\" and described her pictures as \\"very direct and forceful, painted in a virile manner.\\" She worked alongside Chase at his summer schools in Florence (1910, 1911), Bruges (1912), Venice (1913), and Carmel, California (1914).  Legacy  Portrait of William Merritt Chase, c. 1910, Metropolitan Museum of Art = Posthumous misattributions = In the 1920s, Lang's family sold her possessions and artworks. On a few of her paintings, including her portrait of Chase now at the Metropolitan Museum, her signature was cut away or erased and replaced with fraudulent Chase signatures. In the 1970s, the art historian Ronald G. Pisano identified a number of her works that had been misattributed to Chase. At the time, her portrait of her mentor was on exhibit and ranked among the important self-portraits in which painters \\"capture the essence of themselves.\\" Pisano observed that the obliteration of her signatures \\"in such a wanton way is the ultimate crime that could be perpetrated against an artist.\\" = Surviving works and papers = Institutions that own her paintings include Lancasterhistory.org (Japanese Print, portrait of Helen Thurlow, 1951.013), the Tweed Museum of Art in Duluth (Conversation in the Park, D62.x15), the Metropolitan Museum of Art (portrait of Chase, 1977.183.1), the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (portrait of J. Liberty Tadd, 1944.22) and the Huntington Library, Art Collection, and Botanical Gardens (portrait of Mary Hunter Austin, AU 5464). The Huntington also owns a few of Lang's letters (AU 3451 and 3452), as does the Smithsonian's Archives of American Art (Carnegie Institute, Museum of Art records, correspondence, Box 73, folder 73.46, and Macbeth Gallery records, reel 2606, microfilmed). Works by Chase that Lang collected include his portrait of the artist Baron Hugo von Habermann (Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, 33-1599), Lady in Opera Cloak (Grand Rapids Art Museum, 1935.1.4), Self- Portrait (National Gallery of Art, 2014.136.15), and Still Life (Fish from the Adriatic) (Chrysler Museum of Art, 71.847). In 1913, the Met had acquired Portrait of a Lady in Black (Annie Traquair Lang) (Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1928-63-4) from Chase, but a few months after his death, his widow Alice reclaimed the painting and Lang later acquired it. Alice Chase replaced it at the Met with her husband's For the Little One (13.90), a portrait of herself sewing clothes for one of the couple's 13 children.

Trained in New Orleans and Paris, Campbell had the double distinction of being the first Southern woman who came to New York to make portrait painting a profession, and one who has earned a competency. When the work began to tell on her eyes, she was obliged to limit her time spent on miniatures and alternate it with larger pieces. In the present day, her portraits of Ulysses S. Grant and Henry Morrison Flagler are part of the Smithsonian's collection at the National Portrait Gallery. Early years and education Georgine Campbell was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1861. She was a daughter of Dr. George Washington Campbell, a descendant of the Scotch family of that name. Her father was one of the wealthiest and most influential men in the South, where the family lived and had been social leaders all the way back to the times of Osceola and President Jackson. As a young girl, Campbell first studied with Francois Bernard, who alternated his time between New Orleans and Paris. She was his only pupil. He took her on trial for two months and kept her until she went abroad to study in Paris, under Federico de Madrazo, to whom she attributed much of her success. During her absence, her father's plantations were three times under water, and she returned to find the great estate a swamp. In the midst of this trouble, her father died. Career right After her father's death, it became necessary for Campbell to support herself, and she turned to her art. Her first orders were from St. Louis after which she decided to come to New York, starting off with a few hundred dollars in her pocket, and three letters of introduction. The people named in the letters all died within the first year, but her income started to grow. She lived in a hotel until she bought a home on Madison Avenue from which the increasing noise drove her away. Campbell then lived with her mother and sister in an apartment overlooking Central Park where she had the space and quiet necessary for her work. Campbell received favorable mention on several occasions when her pictures were exhibited, and in the World's Fair in New Orleans in 1883 and 1884, she received the blue ribbon. When the work began to tell on her eyes, she was obliged to limit her painting in miniature and alternate it with larger pieces. Campbell died in 1931. Subjects Though doing a miniature now and then, Campbell at first confined her work largely to oil and pastel, during which period she painted four portraits of Senator Leland Stanford, followed by others of Senators William Morris Stewart, Joseph N. Dolph, George Hearst and Vance, as well as Chief Justice Stephen Johnson Field. and General Ulysses S. Grant. A letter from Colonel Frederick Dent Grant speaks of Campbell's portrait of his father as “an excellent likeness, and one of the best he has seen in oil.” An unsuccessful attempt was made by burglars to steal this valuable painting shortly after it was finished; they had cut it almost entirely from the frame when they were suddenly surprised and fled. In addition to this particular portrait for the family, she made six others: one for the late Senator Stanford, one for the Republican Club of Helena, Montana, and one for a prominent resident of Chicago. Others who sat for her were the two children of Colonel Frederick Dent Grant, whose portraits he took with him to the legation at Vienna; General Grant's wife, Julia Grant; Ida Marie Honoré, and the daughter of General Joseph Lancaster Brent of Baltimore. Additional portraits were painted of Cora Urquhart Brown-Potter, Elizabeth Wharton Drexel and Outerbridge Horsey. Others included Joseph William Drexel and his daughter, Elizabeth Wharton Drexel; a daughter of Mr. William Kissam Vanderbilt; a nephew of Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt; Miss Fanny Field; Mary Ball, the mother of Mrs. Washington, taken from a water color in possession of Mrs. Benjamin S. Storey, a great-niece of General Washington; and two children of Jacob Perkins, of Cleveland, Ohio, who are represented taking five o’clock tea on the lawn in front of the house; General Ulysses S. Grant sat for Campbell.

Clara Welles Lathrop The sisters Clara Welles Lathrop (1853–1907), Bessie Stebbins Lathrop (1854–1930) and Susanne (Susie) Lathrop (1860–1938) were artists and teachers in Northampton, Massachusetts, who exhibited and traveled widely. Clara was a painter, Bessie was a leather worker and woodcarver, and Susie illustrated publications. In addition to exhibiting in the U.S. and Europe, they organized intellectual salons at their Northampton studio and taught art at schools including Smith College. Biographies The sisters were daughters of Henry Lathrop (1811–1888), a dry-goods merchant, and Clara Stebbins Lathrop (1823–1908), a philanthropist who founded a home for aged and invalid women in Northampton. The girls’ grandfather Daniel Stebbins was a physician and entrepreneur who raised silkworms in Northampton mulberry groves (family homes were at 57 and 81 Bridge Street and 78 Pomeroy Terrace). The sisters spent early years in Savannah, where Henry ran a store and briefly manufactured Confederate uniforms. During the Civil War, the family fled to Montreal but remained financially comfortable; they studied at Bute House, and portraits of them by the society photographer William Notman survive at the McCord Museum in Montreal. The girls’ brother Dwight (1851–1887), who became a railroad cashier in New York, stole from the company and ended up in Sing Sing prison. The sisters all studied at Smith College. Clara and Susie also trained at the Académie Julian in Paris, Susie studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (her mentors over the years included Alice Barber Stephens, Rhoda Holmes Nicholls, Edward Percy Moran and Julius Rolshoven), and Bessie attended the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art and Karl von Rydingsvard's woodcarving classes. The sisters traveled and painted along Cape Cod and eastern Canada and, in Europe, from Norway to Venice. They gave private art lessons and taught at Smith, the Clarke School for the Deaf and nearby girls’ schools including Mary A. Burnham School, Miss Howard's and the MacDuffie School. Achievements Clara, a member of the Woman's Art Club of New York, worked in oil, watercolor and pastel and was known for portraits, studies of flowers and views of Cape Cod, Holland, Cornwall, Brittany and Venice. (Her works are usually signed C. W. Lathrop.) She exhibited at venues including the Paris Salon (1891), 1893 World's Columbian Exposition (Palace of Fine Arts), Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1887, 1891, 1895, 1898), Art Institute of Chicago (1889, 1892, 1896, 1898), Boston Art Club (1890, 1892), American Water Color Society (1892, 1898), Art Association of Indianapolis (1892), Gill's Art Galleries in Springfield (1889, 1890), Woman's Art Club (1892, 1893, 1894), National Academy of Design (1892, 1893), the Art Club of Philadelphia (1892, 1893) and the New York Water Color Club (1893, 1895, 1897). Critics lauded her work in publications including The Art Amateur, Quarterly Illustrator and the New York Times. The Springfield Republican praised her skill at rendering “every delicate shade imaginable” and observed that Susie “has a genius for figure drawing and character.” Susie worked mainly in watercolor and pen and ink, specializing in scenes of Greek mythology and rural Massachusetts. She exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago (1889), American Water Color Society (1889, 1892, 1893), Boston Art Club (1890, 1891) and Art Club of Philadelphia (1892). She illustrated M. Helen Beckwith's children's book, In Mythland, and published sketches of local scenery in Picturesque Hampshire and The History of Florence, Massachusetts. Bessie, a member of the Society of Arts and Crafts of Boston, tooled leather and wood for furniture and panels in medieval and Renaissance styles. She showed at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition (Woman's Building's Record Room), Detroit Architectural Club (1909) and Smith College (1913, 1914). The Springfield Republican described her furniture as evidence that her “hand is sure and her eye true.\\" The sisters held group shows and intellectual salons at their studio in downtown Northampton (Bernard Berenson lectured there in 1894), which was draped with fishnets and packed with paintings, prints, embroideries, woodcarvings and ceramics. Later years In 1906, Clara was appointed successor to Smith College art teacher Mary Rogers Williams (1857–1907). In June 1907, Clara died suddenly of meningitis. After her death, Bessie and Susie continued teaching but largely stopped exhibiting artwork. Institutions that own Lathrop pieces include the Smith College Museum of Art (Clara's portrait, A French Flower Girl, SC 1907:1-1), Harvard's Houghton Library (Clara's 1897 pastel portrait of Emily Dickinson's sister-in-law Susan, MS Am 1118.9) and the Emily Dickinson Museum (Bessie's triangular chair based on German models). Susie is portrayed at her easel outdoors in the Hestia Art Collective's 1980 mural, The History of Women in Northampton. Speaking during the Hestia Mural 35th Anniversary Lecture on November 7, 2015, The New York Times columnist Eve Kahn said the Lathrop sisters operated an artistic salon in Northampton which attracted speakers like the celebrated art historian Bernard Berenson. They traveled to places such as Venice, Norway and Nova Scotia. They exhibited their masterpieces from Paris in France to Indiana in the U.S. The sisters also taught art at various Western Massachusetts institutions which included Clarke School for the Deaf. They were laid to rest next to each other at the Bridge Street Cemetery in Northampton.

At the behest of August the Strong, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland, in 1729 the Engineer-Captain Christian Friedrich Erndel drew up a Building Plan, giving the desired regularity to the growing suburb using a uniform street grid. A year later, the Elector declared the Ostra settlement to be named \\"Neustadt\\" (abbreviated to NeuOstra), next to the similar-named suburb of Altendresden on the right side of the Elbe, which was formed in 1685, \\"Neuen Königsstadt\\" (abbreviated to Neustadt).Die Gartenkunst, 19 (2007), Nr. 1, S. 1-46, Barbara Bechter, Der Brühlische Garten in Dresden-Friedrichstadt 1734 Under the direction of General Lieutenant von Bodt, Erndel wrote a report about the defence building works required for the Stolpen FortressDie \\"Military Revolution\\" und der deutsche Territorialstaat unter besonderer Berücksichtigung Brandenburg-Preußens und Sachsens Determinanten der Staatskonsolidierung im europäischen Kontext 1670-1740; Inaugural-Dissertation zur Erlangung des Doktorgrads der Philosophie des Fachbereichs 05 der Justus- Liebig-Universität Gießen vorgelegt von Thomas Wollschläger M.A. aus Halle a.d.

On the specification of the Engineer-Colonel Erndel, a five cubit high earth traverse was placed at a right-angle over the crucifix shaft in track-like fashion in the direction of the Altstadt, to Neustadt, covered, however, quite perpendicularly with a strong brick wall. Ten cubits from this wall an earthwork was erected, covered by a 4½ cubit high brick wall, which was allowed to run to the level to Neustadt. Thereby was created, over the entire five arches, a formal, covered, 10 cubits wider and about 5 cubits deeper moat, over which, so as not to disturb the passage over the bridge, one laid a battle bridge, which in case of emergency could be quickly thrown off.Chronik der Dresdener Elbbrücke, nebst den Annalen der größten Elbfluthen von der frühesten bis auf die neuste Zeit, von Wilhelm Schaefer, Adler & Dietze, 1848 Ansicht von Alt und Neu Dresden 1648.jpgElbe Bridge in 1648 Das Kruzifix auf der Elbbrücke in Dresden.jpgThe crucifix stood on the Elbe Bridge from 1670 until the flood in 1845.

VBB tickets can be purchased that allow travel on the tramway, along with other transport in the VBB scheme. For passengers only travelling on the tram, the line also sells single, 10 journey, and monthly tickets, only valid on the tram. For these tickets the line is divided into three zones: Berlin, Schöneiche, and Rüdersdorf. Fleet The tramway currently operates three types of vehicle in regular use. The oldest vehicles in use are four Düwag GT6 trams, purchased from Heidelberg. These were originally built in 1966 and 1973, and do not provide low floor access. The other main part of the fleet are three Tatra KT4DNF trams, which were purchased from Cottbus and Szeged, and were built in 1987 and 1990. These do provide low floor access to the middle section of the tramcar. Recently, the tramway has purchased two prototype Transtech Artic low floor articulated trams.

The suite can be considered a kind of preparatory study to the opera La Conquista (Prague National Theatre, 2005). This story—says the composer—is of great relevance and reminds us that cultural diversity is a precious asset that must not be squandered.CD booklet, p. 11. A typical performance lasts about one hour and ten minutes.  Analysis  The poems can be performed individually or together. The compositional concept that underlines the cycle confirms the theatrical nature of Ferrero; each piece has its own colour, a specific character, but at the same time subtle thematic links hold the parts together, according to a well-calculated interplay of rhythmic, melodic and harmonic references.Napoli, Guida alla musica sinfonica, p. 202. The cycle follows the chronological order of the historical events: # Presagios: the Aztec chronicles prophesy disaster in the years preceding the arrival of the Spanish. #Memoria del fuego: having laid anchor at Veracruz, Hernán Cortés orders the scuttling of the ships, to prevent mutiny by the crew. #La ruta de Cortés: the Spaniards set out across inaccessible mountains and after a march of more than a thousand kilometres they reach the Valley of Mexico. #El encuentro: Moctezuma and Cortés meet on the Great Causeway leading into the capital, Tenochtitlan. #La matanza del Templo Mayor: in the absence of Cortés and taking advantage of the religious ceremonies of the Aztecs in the Templo Mayor, the Spanish massacre them. #La noche triste: the Aztecs revolt and temporarily drive out the invaders. In their retreat, the Spanish suffer heavy casualties and legend has it that Cortés wept over their losses. This episode is called La Noche Triste and the old tree where this allegedly happened is still a monument in Mexico.  Instrumentation  La Nueva España is scored for 2 flutes (also piccolo and bass flute), 2 oboe, cor anglais, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 French horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, harpe, piano, celesta, timpani, 3 percussions and strings.

He currently lives and works in Benque d’Aurignac in South West France. Early life and education Reid was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 1963. In 1967 he moved to London, attending Priory Comprehensive School Wimbledon and the Priory Grammar School in Shrewsbury. Reid has said that woodwork and metalwork lessons featured prominently in his school life. In 1984 Reid graduated from North London Polytechnic with a BA in Politics and History, before completing an MA in Systematic Theology at King's College London.  Career  After graduating from King's College in 1995 Reid travelled to Berlin where he saw the works of late-Gothic German sculptors Tilman Riemenschneider and Gregor Erhart. Their work left a great impression on him and served to stimulate his burgeoning curiosity and interest in sculpting and carving with limewood. Reid's pursuit of this ambition led him to apprentice with North London-based antique restorer A. J. Brett, before moving on to the then-renowned Spink Restoration Workshop, now Arlington Conservation, where he worked for the next 10 years. Whilst at Spink he worked for a variety of established institutions such as the Metropolitan Museum New York, the Getty Museum California, Harewood House and the Sir John Soane Museum London. He has since said of this time that he arrived at his career in limewood sculpting through restoration. With the acquisition of his own workshop, Reid began creating personal work in earnest in 1995. His first solo exhibition was in 1999, and he went on to exhibit extensively in the UK and internationally, predominantly in the US and in France.  Notable work and commissions  In addition to his personal work, Reid has been commissioned for numerous public and private sculptures. From 1999 until 2001 he was artist in residence at St. Matthew's Westminster, during which time he created a statue of ‘Madonna and Child’, a piece that has attracted both acclaim and controversy due to his portrayal of a naked Mary. In 2013 he was commissioned by the publisher David Fickling to create sculptures of four of their most prominent authors: Philip Pullman, Dame Jacqueline Wilson, Nick Sharratt, and Ian Beck. The sculptures, each measuring 2 feet high, were full figure portraits carved out of limewood and handpainted by Reid. The portrait of Dame Jacqueline Wilson won the Society of Portrait Sculptors annual prize for best portrait for 2015.  Themes  Reid's work to date is almost exclusively concerned with the exploration of the human form through sculpture, and is typically realistic in its interpretation of his sitter. He works using both photographic references and studies from life, a method that can create a slightly distorted or exacerbated perspective. In this way he challenges the way we experience the portrait and its subject, an aspect of his work that he pushes even further in his relief sculptures, commenting of these that they are ‘both the photographic image but…also the distortion of the photographic image. The reliefs…make a whole different way of seeing’. At King's College, Reid wrote his postgraduate thesis on the relationship between revelation and art, a philosophical consideration that continues to impact upon his work. Whilst he would consider himself to be agnostic, his curiosity and interest in theology and living a spiritual life is evident in his artistic work and practice, and he has created numerous sculptures that are concerned with religious figures or themes including a figure of Adam for Mirfield College, Yorkshire, a sculpture of St. Editha for Polesworth Abbey, and a nude crucifixion for Saint George's Church in Paris.

In March 2015, the DMWW board sued three Iowa counties for violating the Clean Water Act with high nitrate discharges, which contribute to hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico.  History  The Des Moines Water Works are a municipal water utility, owned by the about 500,000 residents of the greater Des Moines area, whom it supplies with water. It is Iowa´s largest water utility and among the largest 100 utilities in the country. In 1871, Frederic Hubbell and Jefferson S. Polk organized the Des Moines Water Company with $3000. B. F. Allen, helped to raise $250,000 and became the company’s first president. The company passed to Polk & Hubbell, and in 1880 to a joint-stock company, where a stockholder-elected board of five directors appointed a president, secretary, and one member, with the exclusive rights to operate the company for 40 years. The Water Company was built on Walnut Street in Des Moines using Holly system hydrants, which could throw six streams at a time. The city demanded 10 miles of pipe within 10 months and \\"hydrants were placed for citizens or passersby to draw water for purposes of drinking\\". Pumps discharged about 2 million gallons per day (mgd). In its first year from June 1872 through June 1873, the Water Works´ operating costs were $5,770 and consumers paid no city taxes for water use. Supply well for Des Moines Water Works, 1880 Water came from an iron filtering tank in the gravel and sand of the Raccoon River near the water’s edge, 12 feet in diameter and 14 feet high, open at the bottom and closed at the top with perforations to let water in. The iron filters constantly plugged and after 10 years, in 1883, an infiltration gallery system to use groundwater along the river was planned, the first of its kind in the U.S. From 1884-1885, 750 feet of a wooden gallery were constructed, and the iron filters were abolished. A small primitive dam on the Raccoon River increased the water level near the gallery. In 1880, the name was changed to Des Moines Water Works Company. In 1891, the first water tower was constructed, holding 530,000 gallons of water, used until 1931, and torn down in 1939. =1900–1919= In the early 1900s, many people who died of typhoid, were those with private wells. In 1902, a new water gallery was begun out of large concrete rings 5 feet in diameter and 2 feet long, held slightly apart to allow water seeping in. Flooding delayed continuation until 1904 until completion in 1910. In June 1903, a flood was then said to be \\"the worst in history\\" with business suspended, hundreds became unemployed and homeless. In 1910, ponds were constructed in the park began that could augment the water supply and in 1918, a pumping station built on the park pumped water from the river into the ponds. From 1872 to 1919, \\"there were constant complaints by the city council and newspapers\\". The city tried to buy the Water Works, but either could not raise the funds or could not get the votes needed. In 1897, the newspaper and city council attacked water quality \\"to lower the company’s asking price\\". In 1898, the people voted a proposal to buy the company down. In 1911, the vote passed, but Denman wouldn’t sell at the price. Denman explained publicly why he could not accept the city’s offer and how the city hadn’t paid its water bills for several years. In 1911 the City passed an ordinance for standards of water purity. and in 1912 DMWW started adding hypochlorite and began a water testing laboratory with a chemist, a bacteriologist, and an assistant. In 1917, an outside source conducted a study on the conditions of the Des Moines river and Raccoon Rivers, where the main pollution of the latter \\"was said to come from nearby privies, sewage from upstream residents, septic tanks, and a car shop in Valley Junction\\". In 1913, a price agreement was reached and in 1914 a vote to purchase passed. The vote to issue bonds did not pass until November 1918, and at that unfavorable time for the bond market, the city could not sell enough bonds, and sued for an extension of time. In 1919, the city bought the water company. The company’s name was changed again to Des Moines Water Works (DMWW). It was formed as a public utility owned by ratepayers under a new Code of Iowa, Section 388. Charles Denman, who had been running the company since 1896, became General Manager with a salary of $8,000. =1920–1999= In 1920 a new pumping station at its present site began operation. In 1923, an attorney prepared a bill for the legislature to abolish the City Councils supervision of the DMWW Board. The Board is responsible to run DMWW and the Mayor appoints Board members when vacancies occur with the City Council only approving the appointments. In 1928, Denman recommended adding a softening plant to save customers money spent on soap and wear and tear on clothes. Arguments for and against it continued with the Board voting to delay building until 1938 and further delayed by World War II. In 1929, the Hazen water tower, Des Moines only water tower, 110 feet high was constructed of concrete and steel, holding 2 million gallons of water. In 1931, the benefit of fluoride in preventing tooth decay opened a controversy for three decades. Between 1933 and 1935, during the Great Depression, about 3500 men could not pay their water bills, and Denman offered them work often for several days, laying water mains, grade park roads, inspect hydrants. Seven thousand plantings of trees and shrubs were made yearly from seedlings grown in the greenhouse. In 1942, DMWW bought 650 acres of farmland southwest of Des Moines to build an emergency reservoir, the Dale Maffitt Reservoir, which was opened for fishing in 1948. In 1945, another flood and in 1947 a record-breaking flood occurred. From 1948-49, the softening plant was built, called the filter building which housed the laboratory and the water rate increased for the first time in 50 years. In 1950, levees around the Fleur Drive treatment plant were built. In 1959, DMWW started fluoridating its water at the request of the city council. In 1955, the Nollen Standpipe and the Wilchinski Standpipe were built. Land for a north standpipe was purchased in 1955, but construction did not begin until 1959. In 1973, this standpipe, near Sears at Merle Hay Mall, was named Tenny standpipe. In 1957, Iowa Light and Power installed a substation at DMWW and electric motors and pumps began to be used ending steam power. In 1958, eight more filters and two more softening basins were added to the filter plant. It was decided a dam would be constructed at Saylorville, Iowa but groundbreaking took until 1965. In 1972, DMWW installed water meter reading equipment on the outside of homes. In 1985, an office building was built. In 1992, the eight tanks of a nitrate removal facility were built. In 1993, the Raccoon River crested at a record 14.7 feet above flood stage, forcing the Fleur Drive treatment plant to be shut down and residents were without any water service for 11 days, and non-potable water for 18 days. The height of the levees was increased to a height of 31 feet. In 1998, ground was broken for a new treatment plant, called the Maffitt Treatment Plant. =21st century= DMWW building, 2016 In May 2000, a 25 mgd facility, the Water Treatment Plant at Maffitt Lake, renamed the L.D. McMullen Water Treatment Plant in 2007, began operation using five radial collector wells as its main source, and additionally also from Maffitt Reservoir. In August 2003, a monthly pump record was set at 2,262.82 million gallons. In June 2006, ground was broken for a third treatment plant with a capacity of 10 mgd, the Saylorville Water Treatment Plant, using membrane technology to soften and purify the water. In June 2006, a daily pumpage record of 90.19 mg was set. During the Iowa flood of 2008, the Raccoon River crested at 12.5 feet above flood stage, but DMWW operated normally due to levee work and flood preparation. In April 2011, the Saylorville Water Treatment Plant began operating, serving customers north of Des Moines. First, oxidation precipitates dissolved iron and manganese in shallow groundwater. Ultrafiltration (UF) membranes filter out particulate i.e. undissolved material in the water. Thereafter, part of the water will go through the reverse osmosis membranes, which have smaller pores than the UF membranes and filter out dissolved material in the water, targeting calcium and magnesium ions (water hardness) and for nitrate reduction. In July 2012, a new monthly pumpage record was set at 2,544.12 million gallons and a new record for daily pumpage at million gallons. In March 2015, the DMWW board voted to sue Calhoun, Buena Vista and Sac county for high nitrate discharges into the Raccoon River, and their failure to obtain a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit or state permit in violation of the Clean Water Act. The lawsuit contends that tile drainage lines exacerbate pollution by moving nutrients more quickly to waterways. DMWW must comply with the maximum contaminant level (MCL) standard set by the Environmental Protection Agency, and pay to remove the nitrate and in the winter of 2014/2015 DMWW spent $540,000 for nitrate removal. DMWW wants agricultural polluters to abide by the Clean Water Act, which they are exempted from, because agricultural runoff comes from multiple point sources across a large region. The Iowa Farm Bureau and Governor Terry Branstad are against the lawsuit and the Iowa Drainage District Association wants to help the lawsuit. Most Iowans have supported the lawsuit, up to 71% of urban residents, but most did not think water quality was the state's most important issue. Even the Iowa Soybean Association has conceded, that more ways to finance the 2013 Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy plan (cutting the nitrogen and phosphorus by 45 percent) need to be found in light of the problem in the Gulf of Mexico dead zone. In March 2017, a federal district court dismissed the DMWW claims saying the Iowa legislature was \\"the appropriate body to address the state’s water quality crisis\\". In February 2017, a bill called Dismantling the Des Moines Water Works - HF 484/SF 456 was proposed to move assets and power to local municipalities. DMWW´s Bill Stowe called it \\"clearly retribution for our lawsuit\\". At the end of the legislative session in April 2017, the bill was moved to unfinished business in the House and was funneled in the Senate. Bill history HOUSE FILE 484 The Iowa Legislature, accessed 27 April 2016  System Information  , the DMWW pumps water from three conditioning plants through about of buried water main with 9,800 valves. It maintains over 80,000 water meters and automated reading devices, about 10,000 fire hydrants and 7 water storage facilities. Maximum daily demand was 96.64 MGD in July 2012. The water pressure averages 50 psi but ranges from 35 psi to more than 100 psi depending on the location. Water towers help stabilize pressure in some zones. Water is pumped inside when water demand is low and flows back out to satisfy higher demands. Des Moines is divided into four pressure zones, with dedicated pumping stations. DMWW operates Water Works Park, an urban park of about 1,500 acres near downtown Des Moines, and Maffitt Reservoir with 1,300 acres of wooded land and a 200-acre lake. DMWW sold water wholesale to more than 20 regional entities. West Des Moines and Waukee have been using 20 percent of DMWW clean water or 12.5 million gallons of water a day. West Des Moines Water Works, which produces 70% of the water West Des Moines consumes, found in 2015 that the projected water demand would meet its plant´s production limits in 2017. Both it and Waukee consider tapping the Raccoon River alluvial aquifer after DMWW increased its rate by 10% in 2016. =Budget= DMWW assets were $250 million. The 2017 budget assumes $62 million of operating revenue and operating expenses of $41.6 million, capital infrastructure costs of $29.6 million and $5.3 million for debt repayment. =Water rate= Effective April 2017, residential customers inside Des Moines pay $4.11/1000 gallons of water, and residents within Polk County almost twice as much, $8.10. A separate water availability fee varies depending on the meter size from $6 to $75 inside the city. For sewer service inside the city, the rate is $6.59 per 1,000 gallons, outside the city it is $13.18 per 1,000 gallons. Stormwater services cost $11.50 per Equivalent Residential Unit. DMWW also bills on behalf of the Des Moines City Council for Solid Waste Services, its recycling program and yard waste. Governance Under Iowa Code Section 388, the utility is owned by the water rate payers and operated by a Board of trustees, who are appointed by the Mayor of the city of Des Moines and approved by the city council. The Board of trustees has all the powers of the city council to run the utility, but cannot levy taxes. The Board of Trustees hires a General Manager to operate the utility, who prepares an annual budget using revenue from the sale of water as its primary income. The Board of trustees reviews, modifies, and approves it. It is the only body which can enter into contracts.

It is an integral part to national identity. It represents one specific form of cultural memory, which makes an essential contribution to national group cohesion. Historically national communities have drawn upon commemorative ceremonies and monuments, myths and rituals, glorified individuals, objects, and events in their own history to produce a common narrative. According to Lorraine Ryan, national memory is based on the public's reception of national historic narratives and the ability of people to affirm the legitimacy of these narratives. Conflicting versions, dynamicity, manipulation and subjectivity National memory typically consists of a shared interpretation of a nation's past. Such interpretations can vary and sometimes compete. They can get challenged and augmented by a range of interest groups, fighting to have their histories acknowledged, documented and commemorated and reshape national stories. Often national memory is adjusted to offer a politicized vision of the past to make a political position appear consistent with national identity. Furthermore, it profoundly affects how historical facts are perceived and recorded and may circumvent or appropriate facts. A repertoire of discursive strategies functions to emotionalize national narrative and nationalize personal pasts. National memory has been used calculatedly by governments for dynastic, political, religious and cultural purposes since as early as the sixteenth century. Marketing of memory by the culture industry and its instrumentalisation for political purposes can both be seen as serious threats to the objective understanding of a nation's past. Lorraine Ryan notes that individual memory both shapes and is shaped by national memory, and that there is a competition between the dominant and individual memories of a nation. Hyung Park states that the nation is continuously revived, re-imagined, reconstituted, through shared memories among its citizens. National memories may also conflict with the other nations' collective memory. Role of the media Reports that are narrated in terms of national memory characterize the past in ways that merge the past, the present and the future into \\"a single ongoing tale\\". Pierre Nora argues that a \\"democratisation of history\\" allows for emancipatory versions of the past to surface: However, national history being passed on by the culture industry, such as by historical films, can be seen as serious threats to the objective understanding of a nation's past. =International media= Nations' memories can be shared across nations via media such as the Internet.  Effects and functions  National memory can be a force of cohesion as well as division and conflict. It can foster constructive national reforms, international communities and agreements, dialogue as well as deepen problematic courses and rhetoric. Identity crisis can occur due to bad memories (such as national crimes) or the absence of a belief in a shared past. Often new developments, processes, problems and events are made sense of and contextualized by drawing from national memory.  Critical national memory  Critical history or historic memory cuts from national memory's tradition centric to national heritage and orients itself towards a specialized study of history in a more sociological manner. It has been proposed that the unthinkable ought not to be unmasked but that instead what made it thinkable should be reconstructed and that the difficulty of discussing the non-places or the bad places of national memory make it necessary to include forgetfulness and amnesia in the concept. National memory may lead to questioning the nation as it is as well as its identity and imply a societal negotiation of what the country wishes to be as a nation. To understand the links between memory, forgetfulness, identity and the imaginary construction of the nation analysis of the discourse in the places of memory is fundamental as in all writings of national history an image of the nation is being restructured.

History Almost two-thirds of Montana voters approved of Amendment 2, the Montana Executive Department Allocation Amendment, on November 3, 1970. This amendment required that there be no more than 20 state executive or administrative offices, agencies, boards, bureaus, or commissions. The Montana Legislature passed enabling legislation, the Executive Reorganization Act, in 1971, which gave Governor Forrest H. Anderson the legal authority to reorganize state government. On December 20, 1971, Governor Anderson used this authority to create, by executive order, the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation. The agency superseded the Montana Council on Natural Resources and Development, Montana Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, Montana State Board of Forestry, Montana State Conservation Commission, Montana State Forester, and Montana Water Resources Board. Organization and budget =Director and organization= John E. Tubbs was appointed the director of the DNRC by Governor Steve Bullock in 2013. He was reappointed in 2016. DNRC has six divisions: * The Director's Office—This division provides policy and managerial leadership for the department, and administrative support services to itself and other divisions, boards, and commissions. * Oil and Gas Conservation Division—This division supports the Board of Oil and Gas. The board has the statutory authority to issue oil and gas drilling permits; classify oil and natural gas wells; administer completion, disaster, and reclamation bonds for oil and natural gas wells; oversees and regulates the plugging of abandoned oil and natural gas wells; and levies civil and criminal fines on drillers and well operators who violate state law and board regulations. Previously the administrative and technical arm of the Board of Oil and Gas Conservation, this division has only minimal attachment to the department. * Conservation and Resource Development Division—This division provides technical and administrative assistance to conservation districts in the state. It also makes grants and loans to these districts. * Water Resources Division—This division oversees dam safety; floodplain programs; the development, regulation, and operation of state-financed water development projects; water development and use planning; and the verification, examination, and filing of existing and future water rights. * Forestry Division—This division oversees the development, management, operation, and regulation of state forests. It also provides forest and prairie fire prevention and fire suppression services. * Trust Land Management Division—This division manages of trust lands owned by the State of Montana. In addition to its divisions, nine boards and commissions are attached to the department for administrative purposes only: Board of Land Commissioners, Board of Oil and Gas Conservation, Board of Water Well Contractors, Drought Advisory Committee, Flathead Basin Commission, Montana Grass Conservation Commission, Rangeland Resources Committee, Reserved Water Rights Compact Commission, and the Resource Conservation Advisory Council. =Budget and personnel= The DNRC had a total budget of $240.6 million in 2016. Trust lands generated 48 percent of its budget. Revenue operations (fees, services, etc.) generated another 21 percent of all revenues, with general state revenues adding 12 percent and interest on debt another 10 percent. The DNRC had 523.8 full-time equivalent employees in 2016.

His father, František, was an educator who founded the town school in Senftenberg. He completed his early education and some high school when he enrolled in cadet school in Vienna. After graduation he was assigned to the 22nd Home Guard Infantry Regiment in Chernivtsi. He ended his army service with the rank of lieutenant.  Police career  In 1909 Ježek joined the government police, where he served on the Provincial Gendarmerie Command No. 13 in Chernivtsi. The following year passed the professional exam and became commander of the gendarme department in Vyžnyjcy. A few months later he was appointed adjutant commander in Chernivtsi. In 1913 he was promoted to the rank of captain and two years later in 1915 he was transferred to the police headquarters in Vienna, where he was assigned as commander of the department in Sankt Pölten. In 1918, after the establishment of independent Czechoslovakia, he became the commander of the police department in Jindřichův Hradec. In 1919 he was sent to Bratislava, where he became as adjutant provincial police commander. Several years later he was promoted to General Commander of the Police.  Political career  On 16 March 1939 Adolf Hitler established the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia after the German occupation of Czechoslovakia the previous day. In July 1939 Prime Minister Alois Eliáš appointed Ježek the Interior Minister of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia government. Soon after his appointment Ježek was summoned to Berlin where he was informed by Heinrich Himmler that Germany would do whatever was necessary to have the Czech people conform to the new regime. His sentiment often opposes the occupation officials and although he could not openly join the resistance, he supported it. In January 1942 Ježek was relieved of his duties as the Interior Minister for refusing to swear an oath of loyalty. After the war, in 1945 and again in 1947, Ježek was arrested for his activities for the Protectorate but was acquitted of the charges and set free. In 1954 the communist regime tried him for espionage and treason and sentenced him 25 years. He was released early in 1960.  Personal life  In the 1910 Ježek married Olga Semak, a local noblewoman, daughter of Eugene Semak. In 1913 they had a daughter. Ježek died in Prague on 10 May 1969. He is buried in the Olšany Cemetery in Prague.

Life He was born in Trelawny Parish, Jamaica, where his father owned extensive sugar plantations; his mother was a daughter of John Simpson of Bounty Hall in the same parish, also a sugar planter. Both parents died while Kenyon was a boy at Fort Bristol School, Bristol. Thence he went for a time to Charterhouse School, and after some dabbling in experimental science at William Nicholson's Philosophical Institute, in London's Soho, went in 1802 to Peterhouse, Cambridge. He left Cambridge without a degree in 1808, married, and settled at Woodlands, between Alfoxden and Nether Stowey in Somerset. Rich and unmotivated, Kenyon spent his life in society, as a \\"wealthy and generous dilettante\\", and a gastronome friend of Philip Courtenay the reputed epicure. He received money under the Slave Compensation Act 1837 for the Chester Estate, Trelawny Parish, Jamaica, inherited from his brother-in-law, and left £180,000 at his death. He died after a long illness at Cowes on 3 December 1856, and was buried in the vault belonging to his wife's family in Lewisham churchyard. Works Kenyon published: *A Rhymed Plea for Tolerance, London, 1833, dialogue in heroic couplets; *Poems, for the most part occasional, London, 1838; and *A Day at Tivoli, with other Verses, London, 1849. Associations In Somerset, Kenyon made the acquaintance of Thomas Poole. Through Poole he encountered Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth, Robert Southey, and Charles Lamb. His life became an ever-widening circle of men of letters. In Paris during 1817 Kenyon met George Ticknor, the historian of Spanish literature, who corresponded with him for years, and introduced to him many Americans. Among them were Bayard Taylor and James T. Fields. Other friends of Kenyon about this period were Bryan Waller Procter, Augustus William Hare, Julius Charles Hare, and Henry Crabb Robinson. At Fiesole in 1830 he met Walter Savage Landor, who when in England was frequently his guest, and wrote part of Orestes at Delpho under his roof. Kenyon was one of Southey's travelling companions on his French tour in 1838. The Brownings Meeting Browning at a dinner-party, Kenyon discovered that Robert Browning senior, his father, had been at school with him in Bristol; this was the beginning of a lifelong friendship. Kenyon first introduced Browning, at the house of her parents, to Elizabeth Barrett, a relative if not a close one, who became Browning's wife. To Kenyon Browning dedicated his Dramatic Romances and Lyrics. Failing to obtain for Kenyon a copy of the picture Andrea del Sarto and his wife in the Pitti Palace, Browning wrote and sent to him from Florence the poem Andrea del Sarto. When the Brownings visited England, Kenyon's house was their home, and here in 1856 Elizabeth Browning finished Aurora Leigh, and dedicated it to Kenyon. Philanthropy Among the first to profit by Kenyon's philanthropy were Coleridge's family. In later life he distributed money in a systematic manner through intermediaries, who investigated each case. Legacy By his will Kenyon divided his property between friends and charities, the largest legacy of £10,000 being taken by Browning. There were 80 individual bequests to friends. Family Kenyon married first in 1808, and was left a widower when his wife died in Naples in 1818. and in 1823 married Caroline, sister of John Curteis, a wealthy bachelor, whose residence, 39 Devonshire Place, he shared when in London. He had also a villa at Torquay, and others in later life at Wimbledon (Lime Cottage) and Cowes. His second wife died on 7 August 1835, and her brother on 27 April 1849, leaving Kenyon the bulk of his property.

Six years later, she is found in a cabin in the woods, barely alive and with no memory of the years that she was missing. She returns home to learn that her husband has remarried and her son is being raised by the new wife, and she soon finds herself implicated in a new series of murders. Cast and characters * Stana Katic as Special Agent Emily Byrne, a former FBI special agent who disappeared while hunting one of Boston's most notorious serial killers and was presumed dead, but returns six years later with no memory of her abduction. While struggling to rebuild her life and unravel the mystery of her disappearance, she becomes the prime suspect in a string of shocking new murders, and becomes a fugitive. Kalina Zaharieva plays a young Emily. * Patrick Heusinger as Special Agent Nick Durand, Emily's husband and fellow FBI special agent who suffers with guilt that he stopped looking for Emily. He attempts to balance his life with Emily's return and his resurfacing feelings for her against his new marriage to Alice.

It has been recorded in the eastern Mediterranean since 2010, probably reaching that sea through the Suez Canal from the Red Sea by Lessepsian migration. Description Ashtoret lunaris has a carapace which has a finely grained texture as well as has six tubercles in the middle of the dorsal surface, and also a linear tubercle along the middle of the posterior of the carapace. The front has straight lobes, with a lateral and slightly emarginated rostrum which is located in the centre and the front lateral margin has five small tubercles followed by three larger deltoid tubercles. The lateral spine is equalt in length to a fifth of the carapace width. Chelipeds have a five-lobed ridge in the middle of the palm, the second and fourth lobes of which are pointed with the second lobe being the largest. There is a ridge on the outer surface of the dactylus of males which is finely grained in texture, this is absent in females. The carapace is beige or yellow in background colour and is covered in red dots. The pereiopods have paddle- shaped tips which facilitate a skimming locomotion along the substrate and rapid burrowing into sand. In some specimens the paddles have large, dark blotches and sometimes smaller dark spots on the legs. They grow to 3–8 cm in width. Ashtoret lunaris (Forskål,1775) at right Distribution Ashtoret lunaris has a natural distribution in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean from the Red Sea and eastern African coast as far south as KwaZulu-Natal east to New Caledonia, south to Australia and north as far as Japan. The first specimen of A. lunaris recorded in the Mediterranean was a single specimen which was collected at a depth of 20m in Haifa Bay by a trawler in 1987. No specimens were recorded in subsequent years and it was assumed that any population had died out, then in 2015 four female specimens were caught by a trawler in Iskenderun Bay in south eastern Turkey suggesting that the species had become established in the area. The most likely route of colonisation was from the Red Sea through the Suez Canal and then along the northward current that runs along the Israel-Lebanon-Syria coast towards Iskenderun Bay. Biology Ashtoret lunaris is commonly encountered sandy and muddy shores, especially near seagrass beds from the intertidal zone to a depth of 50m. It is usually nocturnal and spends the day buried in the substrate just below the surface creating breathing channels to the surface of the sand. They hunt small shellfish, worms and other animals during the night, they are known to take other crabs. When threatened A lunaris often draws its legs up under the overlapping edges of the carapace and appears to sham death, this may make it difficult for a predator to dismember the crab. Uses Ashtoret lunaris is fished for food using nets but not in Singapore. Name Ashtoret lunaris was described by the Swedish zoologist Peter Forsskål in 1775. The specific name, lunaris refers to the moon. while the generic name Ashtoret refers to the Phoenician moon goddess Ashtoreth.

Common names for this beetle include black twig borer, black coffee borer, black coffee twig borer and tea stem borer. The adult beetle is dark brown or black and inconspicuous; it bores into a twig of a host plant and lays its eggs, and the larvae create further tunnels through the plant tissues. These beetles are agricultural pests that damage the shoots of such crops as coffee, tea, cocoa and avocado. Description This beetle is dark brown or black. The adult female is up to long and about half as wide. The head is convex at the front with an indistinct transverse groove above the mouthparts. Each antenna consists of a funicle (base) with five segments and an obliquely truncated club slightly longer than it is wide. The pronotum is rounded with six or eight serrations on the front edge. The elytra are convex and grooved and have fine perforations, and there are bristles between the grooves. The adult male is a smaller insect, has an unserrated pronotum and no wings. The eggs are smooth, white and ovoid, about long. The larvae are creamy white with brownish heads and have no legs. The pupae are cream-coloured and exarate (with free appendages). Distribution Xylosandrus compactus has a wide distribution in the tropics. Its range extends from Madagascar and much of tropical Africa, through Sri Lanka and southern India, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, China and Japan to Indonesia, New Guinea and various islands in the Pacific. It was introduced into the continental United States in 1941 and has also spread to Brazil and Cuba. It arrived in Hawaii in 1961, and here it infests over one hundred species of timber trees, fruit trees, ornamental trees and fruit bushes. Its presence in Hawaii is putting some rare and threatened endemic trees such as Alectryon macrococcus, Colubrina oppositifolia, Caesalpinia kavaiensis, and Flueggea neowawraea, at risk. Hosts Some 225 species of plants in 62 families have been recorded as acting as hosts for this beetle. In a natural broad-leafed forest it does not normally cause much damage, but when it infects plantations of susceptible host plants it may become a pest. Major crops where it does serious damage are coffee, tea, avocado and cocoa. In India it attacks Khaya grandifoliola and Khaya senegalensis, which are grown as shade trees in plantations, and similarly in Africa it attacks Erythrina sp. and Melia azedarach. It is particularly damaging in tree nurseries, killing seedlings and young saplings. A study in Uganda's shaded robusta coffee systems, tree species suppressing X. compactus infestation characteristically exuded copious sap regardless of any stress. Therefore, the presence or absence of copious sap exuding from trees upon injury likely differentiates X. compactus hosts from non-hosts. Ecology In Florida, where X. compactus has been introduced, the life cycle is completed in about twenty-eight days. Like other ambrosia beetles, the adult female carries fungal symbionts, particularly Ambrosiella xylebori and Fusarium species. These fungi colonize the xylem tissue of the plant host, and are consumed by the adult beetles and larvae. Male larvae are produced from unfertilised eggs and are few in number; they remain in the gallery and eventually mate with their sisters. After pupation, the newly emerged female beetles remain in the tunnels for about eight days, and mating takes place here. They then crawl out of the tunnels and fly to another host tree, carrying some of the fungus with them. Here they tunnel into sound wood on the underside of the branch, introduce the fungus and start laying eggs. The females live for about forty days; symptoms of the infestation of a twig include the death of the stem and leaves beyond the tunnel entrance.

It was established during the formation of the Union Defence Force (UDF) and reflected the UDF's mixed traditions, which drew on both the British model of a standing professional army as well as the Afrikaner model of a large citizen militia. The South African Defence Act (No. 13) of 1912 dictated that the UDF include a Permanent Force of career soldiers and a \\"Citizen Force\\" of volunteer reservists or conscripts mobilised during temporary crises.Library of Congress Country Studies: South Africa, Early Development of the South African Military, 1996 Prior to World War II, the Citizen Force consisted of a general manpower pool of white South African civilians who had received some military training in the past. They were periodically retrained for deployment in the event that they were mobilised for active service. The UDF had few professional career soldiers during the 1930s, so the bulk of its active manpower at any one time was vested in the Citizen Force. This was considered adequate for South Africa's defence requirements, as the country was far removed from potentially hostile forces in Europe and neighbouring territories represented no military threat. The Citizen Force was retained in the restructured South African Defence Force (SADF) after the UDF was disestablished in the late 1950s. White South Africans completing their national service were automatically enrolled in the Citizen Force for five years, being expected to serve at least nineteen days a year. In 1977 this was increased to thirty days a year for an eight-year period. Thereafter they were considered part of the Citizen Force Reserve for another five years, and could still be called into military service if their skills were needed. The Citizen Force was made up wholly of white South African men until 1978, at which time Coloured South Africans who had previously served in the Cape Corps were enlisted in the Citizen Force as well. The first Coloured Citizen Force officers were commissioned in October 1978. By the late 1980s, the Citizen Force accounted for 68% of the SADF's total manpower. No black South Africans were enlisted in the Citizen Force, as the majority of the SADF's black recruits were professional soldiers and they lacked the part-time military tradition of the country's white community. In 1988 the racial composition of the Citizen Force was 96.3% white and 3.7% Coloured. The South African military establishment underwent another major restructuring process in 1994 with the formation of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF). The retention of preexisting Citizen Force units was favoured by the SANDF because they worked well with the new force design and structure placing an emphasis on domestic defence. Additionally, as a reserve formation the Citizen Force was seen as cost-effective. It was renamed the SANDF Conventional Reserve at some point between 1994 and 2003.

He died in Sainte-Hyacinthe in 1995. Education He was interested in painting from an early age, his first painting was in 1950. At 17 years old, he was admitted to the École des Beaux-Arts in Montreal and for five years he attended the workshops of several Jacques de Tonanncour R.C.A. and Stanley Cosgrove R.C.A. During successive trips to Mexico and the United States, he was introduced to the work of sculpture on granite and the size of precious stones. While continuing his research in painting, he completed his training and obtained in 1965 his diploma of Psycho-educator. During his three-year course, he directs the plastic art workshops for children with emotional disorders. Career From 1965, he worked as an artist and trained and directed art educators, and also taught human relations. He sold his drawings and paintings every year. After eight years of intense activity, he began to be more focused on developing works of art. Since 1970, he has been actively visualizing in his works his plastic and social experience by introducing, by the unconditional acceptance of others, an imagery that takes into account the theory of the archetypes of Carl C. Jung. In the fall of 1975, the city of Lachine commissioned him to execute a monumental sculpture at a cost of $55,000, from an 11-ton volcanic blue stone imported from Norway. The figurative work unveiled on June 24, 1977 in place of the City Hall of Lachine, represents the four elements and is entitled La Fontaine de Vie. He was awarded the title of Citizen of Honor, a title given to very few citizens since the founding of the city, for his work. Dubois, in his works, reveals a full strength, a moving personality. It is a force of nature that goes to the end of itself. The originality of his work is both powerful and moving, which explains the interest of collectors and guarantees their value. In 1982 he asked many painters to create the Galerie des Maîtres with: Claude Dubois artist, signer and performer, Claude Péloquin poet, speaker, artist and painter.

The referendum attempted to exempt agriculture and agribusiness from compliance with state laws passed in 2015 and later, unless a \\"compelling state interest\\" was involved. The referendum was hotly controversial. Supporters referred to State Question 777 as 'right to farm', while opposition groups referred to it as the 'right to harm', citing concerns over water supply quality, animal welfare, small farmer interests, and loss of representative government. The amendment was generally agreed by scholars and the media to be poorly written with much room for interpretation by legislators and judges, which would likely cause numerous expensive and time-consuming lawsuits to the detriment of the people and farmers of Oklahoma if passed.\\"State Question 777: Constitutional Limits on Regulation of Agriculture.\\" Oklahoma Policy Institute. OKpolicy.org, 25 Oct. 2016. Web. 03 Mar. 2017. The referendum failed, with the vote going 58-42% against the amendment. Text  Overview  The amendment would prevent the Oklahoma Legislature (and, by extension, regulatory agencies whose power derives from the legislature) from enacting new regulations involving farming unless the regulations meet the highest level of examination due to the 'compelling state interest' phrase. It would inhibit many cities and counties from effectively enacting ordinances to prevent water pollution in the agriculture sector by the fact that it would be too expensive for local governments from a litigation standpoint. The legislature would be unable to regulate animal welfare for farm animals such as hogs, pigs and chickens. It is unclear how the amendment would have affected neutral state laws that affected all individuals; presumably, a special carve-out would be applied such that the regulations would be suspended for cases in which they affected \\"farming and ranching practices\\". = Supporting arguments = State Question 777 held support from advocacy groups such as the Oklahoma Cattlemen's Association, Oklahoma Farm Bureau, and the Oklahoma Pork Council. These groups advocated for the bill by saying that it would help them be protected from illegitimate laws and regulations. Specifically, they claim that SQ 777 would protect them from certain ballot initiatives developed and paid for by wealthy animal-rights groups. Another argument is that the bill would shield farmers from restrictive laws, and enable consumers to decide which practices they would support.Charles, Michelle, Stillwater News Press. \\"Oklahoma Farm Bureau Backing Right to Farm.\\" Stillwater News Press. N.p., 14 July 2016. Web. 03 Mar. 2017. Supporters also say that SQ 777 would boost food security. Their argument here is that in the status quo, without SQ 777, legislators could at some point pass laws to restrict food production, thereby increasing food insecurity issues in the state. More generally, supporters advocated from a position of generalized distrust of government intervention. = Opposing arguments = Those in opposition to the bill included the Humane Society of the United States, the Oklahoma Food cooperative (which represents small farmers), the Oklahoma Municipal League, and the Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Civilized Tribes. Arguments against included that SQ 777 would benefit big farming corporations and industrial factory farms by preventing legislation to protect smaller farming groups. If a dispute arose between a large farm and a small farm, it is unclear how government could intervene to settle it under SQ 777, with the result being that small farmers would be unable to assert their rights against misconduct from a large neighbor. Another argument is that the bill would harm the environment, specifically through polluting Oklahoma's drinking water without the ability to protect it from agricultural chemical runoff and animal waste disposal. Opponents also argue that the bill would harm the ability for Oklahoma's elected legislators to secure viable standards and regulations on protecting the environment, food production, and even protection against animal cruelty. Another argument from the opposition is that SQ 777 would harm Oklahoman democracy; that in general, specific classes of activity are not deemed immune from regulation from democratically elected legislators, and that Oklahoma's existing regulation was already extremely lenient and hands-off for Oklahoma business.\\"RIGHT TO FARM OR RIGHT TO HARM?\\" SQ777  Kirkpatrick Foundation. Kirkpatrick Foundation, n.d. Web. 03 Mar. 2017.  Key players  Mark Yates from the Oklahoma Farm Bureau defended the Right to Farm Bill against these claims from opponents of the bill by pointing to the failure of regulations in other states. He referenced Proposition 2, an act by Californian legislators to try to increase the space needed for chickens bred from commercial egg production. Yates argued this legislation was something that a law that caused more problems than anything, by decreasing overall production while increasing production costs. As a result, eggs produced in California were more expensive. However, Brian Ted Jones of Oklahoma's Kirkpatrick Foundation argued that his was a bit misleading. Jones pointed out \\"the price of eggs rose dramatically throughout the country that year, largely because of the unprecedented devastation to poultry flocks caused by a severe outbreak of avian flu\\".\\"Claims That SQ 777 Will Boost Food Security Are Hard to Swallow.\\" Oklahoma Policy Institute. OKPolicy.org, 25 Oct. 2016. Web. 03 Mar. 2017. Notable opponents included the former Oklahoma Attorney General Drew Edmondson, who cited many of these same reasons previously indicated as his rationale for opposing SQ 777 Right to Farm Bill.  Results  The amendment was ultimately rejected by the voters with 58.4% against the bill on November 8, 2016. Additionally, State Question 780 passed, which reclassified certain drug possession crimes involving small amounts of material from felonies to misdemeanors. The results - generally perceived as a \\"liberal\\" victory in a conservative state - showed that \\"there is still a strand of Heartland populism that is skeptical of Big Agra\\" by David Blatt of the Oklahoma Policy Institute.

The school was in existence from 1941 to 1961, when it was closed as a result of the Cuban Revolution.  History  Merici Academy was founded when American Ursuline nuns in Havana saw a need for an English- language girls’ school. The school opened in 1941, with Mother Thomas Voorhies of the New Orleans Ursuline community as its principal. Merici Academy opened with 100 students, although by 1950 it had grown to 300 students. The school was located in the Biltmore neighborhood of Havana. Merici Academy was an elementary and secondary school. Teaching at the academy was conducted in English, with the exception of classes in Language, History and Geography of Cuba, and Civics, which were required by law to be conducted in Spanish. Merici Academy was accredited by the U.S. Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. When the United States broke diplomatic relations with Cuba in January 1961, the American nuns returned to the United States. Merici Academy remained open until May 1961, when it was confiscated by the Cuban government. Many Merici Academy students were sent to New Orleans and other cities in the United States to finish their education.

She was born to the brewer Claes Corneliszoon Ment and Sophia Benningh (1561-1627). She married in 1625 to the official Jan Pieterszoon Coen (1587-1629), general governor of Batavia, in 1632 to Louwissen Marinus van Bergen (1598-1645) and in 1646 to Isaac Buys (1618-1684). She was raised in Amsterdam. When the former governor of Batavia Jan Pieterszoon Coen was due to return to the East Indies, he married her and took her with her on his return from the Netherlands. The purpose of the marriage was explicitly to make his wife a part of his policy to expand the Dutch colony of Batavia with the immigration of Dutch women to marry male colonists and both lay the foundation of a Dutch population there, as well as implement a culturally Dutch society in the colony, with Dutch women who maintained Dutch customs in Batavia after the example of the governor's wife, who were to set example by using her position as the first lady of the colony as the leading missionary of Dutch civilization. Eva Ment accompanied her spouse in company of her daughter, mother, sister and brother in 1627, and settled in Batavia. In Batavia, she set example for all following governor's wives by playing a role similar to a queen: she was provided official ladies-in-waiting and attended all official ceremonies of importance. Though her tenure as governor's wife was short, she made a great impact and was regarded as a role model for Dutch women in the colony, and the life of the Dutch women in Batavia were to become legendary in the 17th century for its luxurious and liberal lifestyle. She took her assignment as a social role model seriously and engaged heavily in societal issues: her most famous project was that she arranged for the upbringing of the illegitimate daughters of Dutch men and Asian women who were taken as foster daughters by the Dutch East Indian company to become wives of the colonists (among them Sara Specx). When she became a widow, she was asked by the Dutch East Indian company to remain and continue her work in the colony, but she declined the offer and returned to Amsterdam, were she remarried twice. In 1632, a new policy was introduced in Batavia: because Dutch women generally had too high demands on luxury and additionally often wished to return to the Netherlands rather than to settled permanently in the colony, which prevented real growth of the colonist population, female immigration to the Dutch East Indies were almost banned (with the exception of the wives and daughters of officials), a reform which was kept until 1869, and the male colonists were instead encouraged to free and marry their Asian slaves, who had lower demands on luxury and who did not wish to live in the Netherlands.

The film was released on April 15, 2013 in conjunction with the release of the book Pump Me Up: DC Subculture in the 1980s. The documentary was narrated by Washington, D.C.-native Henry Rollins. The Legend of Cool \\"Disco\\" Dan provides a documentation of Washington, D.C. during the 1970s and 1980s from the perspective of Cool \\"Disco\\" Dan, and blends commentary by local Washingtonians combined with archival footage, forming a comprehensive portrait of this time period. Synopsis The Legend of Cool \\"Disco\\" Dan examines the life of mythical graffiti artist Cool \\"Disco\\" Dan, while juxtaposing his life against many of the historical events from the 1970s and 1980s that shaped the culture of Washington, D.C. Cool \\"Disco\\" Dan (real name Danny Hogg) was born on December 31, 1969, on the very last day of the 1960s. It was a revolutionary decade that saw the rise of Civil Rights Movement, the assassination of prominent political figures, and the Vietnam War. During this time period, D.C. was experiencing race riots in the aftermath of Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, heightened racial tensions and white flight, and blacks from southern and northern states relocating to D.C. in search of better economic opportunities during the Great Migration. This eventually transformed the city's demographics into a largely majority black city and introduced the label \\"Chocolate City\\". Additionally, it marked the beginning shift in local politics, and the beginning of home- grown music and musical acts (particularly go-go music and culture) all of which influenced Cool \\"Disco\\" Dan's graffiti. Beginning in the 1970s, Hogg adapted the nickname \\"Disco Dan\\" after being inspired by an episode of What's Happening!! He was also fascinated with the murals in the opening credits of Good Times, along with the cover art of many funk albums. He taught himself to draw and eventually was able to completely duplicate the vibrant artwork of those albums. Also around this time, Marion Barry's political career was on the rise, as he was elected mayor with a platform based on helping the poor, implementing a 'summer jobs programs' for the youth, and helping senior citizens and the cities most vulnerable. The development of go-go and harDCore music was also in its early stages. By the 1980s, Disco Dan had perfected his graffiti art skills just as the popularity of go-go music and harDCore was heightening throughout the city. Inspired by \\"roll-calls\\" and call and responses during go-go concerts (where patrons got their names and neighborhoods immortalized on P.A. tapes and live album recordings), Disco Dan began immortalizing himself by tagging his nickname on Metro buses and rails, vacant building, and throughout the Washington metropolitan area. At the height of his fame, go-go was also reaching the height of its fame, and the energy levels around the city had reached a fevering peak with the rise of local sports teams—the Washington Bullets, the Big East Conference and the Georgetown Hoyas (John Thompson, Patrick Ewing, Alonzo Mourning), Maryland Terrapins (Lefty Driesell and Len Bias), Sugar Ray Leonard, and the Washington Redskins (Doug Williams)—and the peak of the local politicians Marion Barry and Sharon Pratt Kelly, along with the crack epidemic and illegal drug trade, AIDS epidemic, materialism, hip-hop music, elevated murder rates, Reaganomics, homelessness, George H. W. Bush's War on Drugs, and the ubiquity of Cool \\"Disco Dan\\" graffiti all peaked simultaneously during this time period.

Retrieved on 3 March 2017. New Hampshire was the ninth state to ratify the Constitution, on 21 June 1788, thus completing sufficient ratification for the Constitution's consummation. Celebrations climaxed with the Federal Processions of July 1788.\\"The Federal Procession in the City of New York\\", New-York Historical Society. Retrieved on 3 March 2017. Historian Whitfield J. Bell, Jr., noted that, prior to the Federal Processions in July, many of the celebrations to mark each states' ratification were \\"official, small, almost sedate; the citizens witnessed them but did not participate.\\"Whitfield J. Bell, Jr. \\"The Federal Processions of 1788\\", The New-York Historical Society Quarterly, v.49 no.1, New-York Historical Society. Retrieved on 3 March 2017. New York's Federal Procession New York's Federal Procession was organized by Richard Platt, the Chairman of the Committee of Arrangements. News of New Hampshire's ratification was sent to Poughkeepsie, seat of New York's ratification convention, and reached New York City on 25 June 1788. Some historians have noted that Federalists, ardent supporters of the Constitution, may have been eager to celebrate ratification in hopes that public \\"enthusiasm shown on the day of the parade would influence the antis at Poughkeepsie,\\" referring to the Anti-Federalists. Platt cited the remarkable enthusiasm of the citizenry as a reason why the parade could no longer be delayed until New York's ratification: \\"The day having been more than once postponed in the interesting hope that this state, then in its convention, would likewise accede to the Union, the Committee of Arrangements found it impossible any longer to oppose this patriotic ardor of their fellow citizens.\\" The procession was originally planned for 10 July, but then was delayed until 22 July. It was delayed again until 23 July, \\"in order to give the Jews an opportunity to join the festivals, the 22nd being one of their holidays.\\" By the time of New York's parade, which was delayed until 23 July 1788, Virginia had also ratified, bringing the total number of states to ten; New York's parade was thus divided into ten divisions to honor those states. On July 22, the day before the march, Platt put an advertisement in the New-York Packet asking for citizens to clean the streets in preparation: \\"The inhabitants of Broad-way, White Hall-street, Great Dock-street, are requested to sweep and water the respective streets on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, for the accommodation of the Federal Procession.\\"\\"Federal Procession\\", NewsBank. Retrieved on 3 March 2017. It is evident from Platt's comprehensive account of the procession that there were sentiments of disappointment regarding the states which had not yet ratified the Constitution. In the Eighth Division, for example, there was \\"The old Constitution, represented by the naked body of a man, denoting Congress without power, with 13 heads, looking different ways; shewing [sic] the clashing interests of the States in Union [...] The ten men well dressed, representing the ten states, supporting the head of a man, representing the New Constitution united in a Federal Head.\\" Presumably, the \\"old Constitution\\" refers to the Articles of Confederation. =Day of the Procession= In his published account of the procession, Platt noted that the parade began at around 10:00am at the sound of 13 guns, fired from the federal ship Hamilton.\\"Federal Procession, In Honor of the Constitution\\", NewsBank. Retrieved on 3 March 2017. The parade was marshalled into ten divisions, to honor the ten states who had at that point ratified the constitution, and each division was preceded by a white flag. The divisions were as follows, as described in Platt's account: # First Division: \\"Foresters with axes;\\" a man dressed as Christopher Columbus \\"in ancient dress\\" astride a horse; farmers; \\"a new invented threshing machine\\"; a band; tailors; bakers; and brewers. # Second Division: Coopers and butchers. # Third Division: Cordwainers. # Fourth Division: Carpenters; furriers; hatters; hair dressers; and artificial florists. # Fifth Division: White smiths; cutlers; confectioners (who carried a \\"Bacchus's cup made of sugar\\" with an inscription of 'the Federal Confectioner' \\"round the goblet's edge\\"); stone masons; brick layers; painters; cabinet makers and chair makers; drum makers; upholsterers; and civil engineers. # Sixth Division: Black smiths; \\"Ship Joiners\\" and \\"Boat Builders\\"; sail makers; and riggers. # Seventh Division: The Federal Ship Hamilton: \\"A frigate of thirty-two guns, twenty-seven feet keel, and ten feet beam, with galleries and everything complete and in proportion, both in hull and rigging; manned with upwards of thirty seamen and marines, in their different uniforms; Commanded by Commodore Nicholson, and drawn by ten horses.\\" # Eighth Division: Cart men; \\"Horse doctors\\"; \\"Mathematical Instrument makers\\"; carvers and engravers; copper, gold, and silver smiths; potters and pewters. # Ninth Division: Lawyers; the Philological Society; merchants and traders. # Tenth Division: Physicians and various others. Platt noted that the procession contained nearly 5,000 people and stretched to over a mile and a half. Even with this number of people, and with crowds lining the streets, Platt noted this: > As this splendid, novel and interesting exhibition moved along, an > unexpected silence reigned throughout the city, which gave a solemnity to > the whole transaction suited to the singular importance of its cause. No > noise was heard but the deep rumbling of carriage wheels, with the necessary > salutes and signals. A glad serenity enlivened every countenance, while the > joyous expectation of national prosperity triumphed in every bosom. Following the procession, a banquet was held, once again divided into 10 long tables to represent the ratifying states. Thirteen toasts were made at the banquet, as quoted from Platt: > Dinner being ended, the following toasts were drank-- # The United States. # > The States which have ratified the New Constitution. # The Convention of the > State of New-York; may they soon add an eleventh pillar to the Federal > Edifice. # General Washington. # His Most Christian Majesty. # His Catholic > Majesty. # The States General of the United Netherlands. # The friendly > powers in Europe. # The patriotic framers of the present national > Constitution. # The memory of those heroes who have fallen in defence [sic] > of American Liberty. # Success of agriculture, manufactures and the > sciences. # May trade and navigation flourish. # The Day; May the Union of > States be perpetual.

It was a convent and currently a government building located in the city of Toledo (Castile-La Mancha, Spain) dated to the 17th century. The Dicalced Franciscans, or gilitos, arrived to this city in the middle of 16th century, establishing it in 1557 in the vicinity of the Ermita de la Virgen de la Rosa. Later, in the early-17th century, two brothers, Francisco and Juan de Herrera, donated to the friars 16,000 ducats for the construction of the new convent. The works began in 1610, and the master of masonry Martínez de Encabo promised to work the church and the convent in four years. Very likely the tracerist of the work was Juan Bautista Monegro, whi with Martínez de Encabo worked in the iglesia de San Pedro Mártir. The convento de los Gilitos, as it is locally known, is a notable example of the simplicity and sobriety of the Toledan architecture of the early 17th century. In this building in 1863 the provincial prison of Toledo was installed, this use lasted until 1931. Then was a barracks for the Guardia Civil and after, a fire station. Currently since 1985 the convent is the seat of the Cortes of Castilla-La Mancha.

The unmanned base was first raked with gunfire before being completely destroyed by a bomb, which was driven through the gate of the base in the bucket of a JCB digger.Peter Taylor - Behind the Mask: The IRA and Sinn Féin p.315 Background In the late 1970s / early 1980s the East Tyrone brigade of the IRA became one of the most efficient & active brigade areas in Northern Ireland. The Brigade was enhanced by the experience and military skill of volunteers like Jim Lynagh, Patrick Joseph Kelly, brothers Padraig McKearney and Tommy McKearney, brigade commander and soon to be IRA Chief of Staff Kevin McKenna. In December 1979 the brigade carried out the Dungannon land mine attack, an ambush in which the brigade killed four British soldiers. In 1985 the brigade now commanded by Patrick J Kelly, began a campaign of destroying remote RUC stations in rural areas and to stop anyone from rebuilding them to create no-go zones. On 7 December 1985 it launched an attack on the RUC barracks in Ballygawley, destroying the RUC base, killing two RUC officers and wounding three. The attack at Ballygawley was just one in a series of attacks by the South Armagh and East Tyrone brigades of the IRA against RUC/British Army bases in rural areas beginning with the 28 February Newry attack which killed nine RUC officers. On 23 June 1985 the IRA fired four mortars at the Crossmaglen British Army base causing no injuries but damaging the base. Four days after the Ballygawley attack, on 11 December 1985, the Tyrone IRA claimed responsibility for mortaring Tynan RUC base, in North Armagh in which four RUC officers were injured. On 19 December the RUC base in Castlederg, in west County Tyrone, was wrecked by a shell during a mortar attack carried out again by the Tyrone IRA. Seven people were injured, and about 250 families evacuated.The Youngstown Vindicator, 12 December 1985 The East Tyrone IRA attacked bases in East Tyrone and North Armagh, while the South Armagh brigade attacked bases in South Armagh and South Down. The attack on The Birches was to be the next big attack of the East Tyrone brigade's campaign against British security force bases. Attack It was a complex attack that involved several units, including teams of dickers (unarmed Volunteers used as lookouts/ watchmen), an armed team and bomb-making experts as well as a team to carry out a diversionary attack. Before the attack on the Birches took place, a diversionary bomb attack was staged at Pomeroy to draw security forces away from the real target. Another team hijacked a JCB digger, getaway vehicles and scout cars at Washing Bay not far from Dungannon.Mark Urban. Big Boys' Rules: The SAS and the Secret Struggle against the IRA, pp. 221-23 The JCB digger would be used to deliver the bomb to its target. The IRA did not expect any resistance as the RUC station was unmanned at the time of the attack. The IRA first raked the base with automatic gunfire while the JCB with a bomb in its bucket was driven through the high wire perimeter fence which surrounded the barracks, the fence was supposed to protect the base from grenade attack or anti-tank type weapons. The digger was most likely driven by young IRA volunteer Declan Arthurs from Galbally, County Tyrone, who joined the IRA in 1982 in the wake of the 1981 Irish hunger strike when he was just 16 years old and had experience driving and operating diggers on his families farm.Robert W White - Out of the Ashes: An Oral History on Provisional Irish Republican Movement p.244,245. Once the digger smashed through the fence a volunteer lit a fuse and the bomb exploded after the IRA had retreated to safety in a waiting van, the blast destroyed most of the base and also damaged nearby buildings and blew the roof of a bar across the road. The IRA team then made its getaway. According to journalist Mark Urban the armed members of the unit evaded British security force roadblocks by escaping in a boat across the southern end of Lough Neagh. About 35 people were reportedly involved in the Birches attack, from planning, executing the attack and creating an escape route. A partially-disabled American tourist and six local civilians were slightly injured in the blast. Aftermath A member of the British security forces who gave Mark Urban a briefing on the Birches barracks said of the attack: > \\"The Birches RUC station was destroyed by the bomb, creating problems for > the authorities about how to re-build it. The Tyrone IRA was able to combine > practical skills such as bomb-making and the welding needed to make mortars > with considerable resources. Its members went on operations carrying the > latest assault rifles and often wore body-amour similar to that used by the > security forces, giving them protection against pistol or sub-machine-gun > fire. By 1987 they had also succeeded in obtaining night-sights, allowing > them to aim weapons or observe their enemy in darkness.\\" The IRA unit's next major target was the RUC police station at Loughgall. This operation was a disaster for the IRA as the operation ended with the IRA unit being ambushed by the SAS and the whole IRA unit of eight, along with a Catholic civilian, were shot dead. Many of those IRA volunteers killed at Loughgall had taken part in the attack on the Birches RUC station, like Padraig McKearney, Jim Lynagh and Patrick J Kelly.

Parts of the original 1658 building were incorporated into the current building when it was erected around 1720 after which it was used by the families of John Codrington and Richard Bampfylde. The house was extended in the 19th century by Thomas Upton. Modernisation including the provision of a water supply was undertaken in the early 20th century. During World War II the house was used as a convalescent home by the admiralty and then as residences by the University of Bristol before returning to use as a private house. The house reflects the many changes and styles of architecture covering the last 300 years and is surrounded by gardens and an estate which includes specimen trees. History The house was originally built in 1658 and extensively remodelled in 1720 with further restoration and expansion in 1912. The 17th century house was built, near the church, for Simon Gorges, a descendant of Ferdinando Gorges. In the early 18th century that house was demolished and parts of it, including the porch, incorporated into the current building. Gorges descendant John Codrington a local member of parliament further developed the house and estate in the 1720s and 1730s. His daughter married Richard Bampfylde and the handed down to their family including Charles Bampfylde. He became bankrupt and in 1800 the Wraxall estate was sold at auction for £28,500 to Philip Prothero of Over, Gloucestershire, however it was eventually purchased by Sir John Hugh Smyth of Ashton Court and used by members of his family. Thomas Upton, who married Florence Smyth, owned the house and, in 1830 he added the flanking wings to the house and created the staircase. Much of the interior decoration of the house dates from this time. For the rest of the 19th century the house was occupied by tenants, including Henry Hallam, until 1911 when it was sold by Lady Smyth to T. Rudding Davey who had the house connected to the mains water supply and installed the plumbing system. He also replaced the ceiling of the study. He died in 1939 but his wife continued to live in the house. In the 1940s the house was used as a convalescent home by the admiralty in conjunction with Barrow Court. In the immediate post World War II period it became residences for students from the University of Bristol. The next owner was Mr T. Lucas who bought it from Major R.E. Davey in 1953. Architecture The two-storey stone house has slate hipped roofs with a parapet. The nine bay front of the house has a central porch at the doorway which has ionic columns supporting a frieze and moulded cornice. From the door the entrance hall goes from south to north and meets an inner hall running east to west with the staircase with wooden balustrade. The drawing room occupies the west bay of the south front and is decorated with palmette designs in a frieze which is typical of early 19th century decorative schemes. The garden has a walled areas, lawns and specimen trees many of which have been planted since 1953.

According to hagiographical accounts, their death followed as a result of the martyrdom of Saints John and Paul. According to the Acta Sanctorum, they were killed during the reign of Julian. This would place their deaths during the years 361 to 363 CE. The traditional date of their martyrdom is June 27, 362. Acta martyrum Their story was synthesized by the Bollandists into a unified account in the Acta Sanctorum using two sources: the Acts of Saints John and Paul (Acta SS. Ioannis et Pauli) and the Martyrology of Saint Jerome (Martyrologium S. Hieronymi). Their story is also recounted, alternately in Italian and Latin, by Antonio Bosio in Roma Sotteranea. According to the martyrologies, the martyrdom of Crispus, Crispinianus, and Benedicta occurred in conjunction with that of Saints John and Paul, two soldiers who were put to death by the order of the emperor Julian the Apostate. Crispus was a priest, Crispinianus a cleric of indeterminate rank, and Benedicta a venerabilis femina (\\"venerable woman\\"). The Bollandist account refers to her as a virgin, whereas Antonio Bosio calls her matrona. In the martyrdom account, John and Paul, condemned and awaiting their death, send for Crispus, Crispinian, and Benedicta so that the priest can offer Mass for them, and so that they can relate the story of their sufferings to the other Christians. John and Paul are being kept under house arrest. Ten days after their first visit, Crispus and his companions attempt to see John and Paul again to comfort them. This time, however, they are turned away by the guards. Shortly thereafter John and Paul are secretly killed and buried in their home. Crispus, Crispinianus, and Benedicta reacted to this news by \\"mourning in their home, and praying each day, and the tears from their eyes did not cease, both day and night.\\" They then pray to receive some sign of where John and Paul had been buried. Shortly thereafter, God reveals the location of the martyrs' bodies to them (manifestavit illis Deus). The means by which this revelation occurred is not specified. The acta then transitions into an account of a court proceeding against the three Christians. They had evidently been surprised while in prayer at the burial site of John and Paul and taken prisoner to be tried by Julian. When Julian interrogates Crispus, he admits the nature of his office in the Church, confessing himself to be peccator presbyter (\\"a priest and a sinner\\"). Ordered to sacrifice to the pagan gods, Crispus refuses, saying, \\"I offer sacrifice always to my Lord God Jesus Christ, day and night; but to your idols, I do not sacrifice.\\" Enraged, Julian moves on to Crispinianus, who likewise confesses his role in the Church, which he describes as being servus servorum Christi (\\"the servant of the servants of Christ\\"). Crispinianus likewise refuses to offer sacrifice to the idols. Finally turning his attention to Benedicta, Julian orders her to sacrifice to the idols and, further, to accept a husband. To this command, Benedicta answers \\"in a loud voice\\" (magna voce): \\"I am a Christian, and I have Christ as my spouse; and I reject your gods, as if they were the dirt upon which my feet tread.\\" Following their profession of faith, Crispus, Crispinianus, and Benedicta are put to death and their bodies left for the dogs. Secretly in the night, however, their bodies are saved by three men: two priests, named John and Pimeneus, and a layman named Fabianus. They are then buried in the home of John and Paul, \\"not far away\\" from the bodies of the martyrs who preceded them in death. Their burial is recorded as having occurred on June 28 (V Kalendas Iulias), the day after their martyrdom. Place of burial This plaque marks the room in which Saints John and Paul were buried, along with Crispus, Crispinianus, and Benedicta. The reputed burial place of John and Paul was later transformed into the present-day Basilica of Saints John and Paul. Archaeological excavations carried out under the basilica in the nineteenth century revealed a complex of Roman homes, with evidence of a confessio (a devotional shrine) marking the place of the martyrs' burial. The wall decoration of the shrine area is datable to the end of the fourth century. The frescoes show two male figures in orans position, probably John and Paul. Another scene shows the arrest of three people, identifiable with Crispus, Crispinianus, and Benedicta. Consonant with the martyrdom account, a dog is shown by the side of the Roman authorities carrying out the execution. Three niches dug into the tuff rock of the confessio have been interpreted as the burial site of the martyrs.

The group advocates for transgender legal, political, and medical rights as well as participating in protests, awareness raising, and fundraising events. Gender Justice League director Danni Askini declaring \\"Trans Pride Day\\" at Seattle city council  History  The Gender Justice League was founded in 2012 by transgender activists and allies. In 2013 they organized the first Trans Pride Seattle, which has since taken place annually in June.  Focuses  = Legal discrimination =  Public Accommodation  One focus of the Gender Justice League is on curbing legislation that disallows transgender individuals from using the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity rather than their sex assigned at birth, otherwise known as bathroom bills. Washington currently has a law that protects transgender individual's rights in public bathrooms, but the League's activists are concerned about petitions that are trying to get rid of these laws and legal initiatives to overrule them. The group claims that their next goal is to change single stall bathrooms across Washington in to gender neutral restrooms.  Name changes  The Gender Justice League has held legal clinics to help transgender individuals legally change their names. These clinics were specifically held between November 2016 and January 2017, due to the group's fear that newly elected president Donald Trump might revoke transgender individual's ability to legally change their names once he was inaugurated. These clinics invited volunteers from various LGBT law organizations to do pro bono work, and the clinics served as many as 200 individuals. A problem arose however, as the Gender Justice League wanted to provide money to those trying to change their names, but were unable to due to their tax status. The League organized with King County to be able to give individuals seeking a name change the money to do so without forfeiting their nonprofit status. = Political activism =  Seattle politics  The Gender Justice League supports various political causes within the city of Seattle, not all of which are strictly related to transgender issues. The League has also supported other efforts within the city, including bills that strengthen tenant's rights. Kshama Sawant was the recipient of a Gender Justice Award in 2015, for her political activism supporting transgender individuals. Sawant has also donated money from her \\"solidarity fund\\" to the League, citing their efforts to help transgender individuals as the reason for her donation.  Washington state politics  The Gender Justice League is active in influencing Washington state politics. They have had an impact in organizing against bills that they believe would harm transgender individuals in Washington, including Washington senate bill 6443 and state ballot initiatives 1515 (2016) and 1552 (2017).  National politics  In 2017 Lambda Legal and Outserve-SLDN filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Gender Justice League against President Trump and the U.S. Department of Defense over the transgender military ban, proposed by Trump on July 26, 2017.  Events  = Trans Pride Seattle = The Gender Justice League organized the now annual Trans Pride Seattle, an event that is very similar to a Gay Pride Parade. The event was first organized in 2013, a year after the organization was founded. The 2016 event drew upwards of 5,000 participants. Members of the Gender Justice League claim that the event is a necessary space for transgender individuals and their allies to form community and overcome isolation. = Gender Justice Awards = The Gender Justice League holds an annual awards ceremony called the Gender Justice awards in which they celebrate individuals who have supported the transgender community. = Solidarity Music Festival = In 2016 the Gender Justice League helped organize the Solidarity Music Festival as a form of anti-capitalist protest.

The Kington & Presteigne Railway opened on 9 September 1875. Commencing at Titley Junction, through Staunton-on-Arrow, in front of the Rodd farm via Corton into Presteigne. By 1929 it was possible to join one of the three steam trains a day – each way – and make the 6 hour journey to London. The passenger service on this line ended in 1951, but a freight service continued to run every other day until the line was finally closed for good in September 1964.  History  The line, which was to run for a distance of five miles from Titley to Presteigne, was sanctioned by an Act of Parliament in 1871. The first earth was cut by Miss Edith Green-Price in 1872, followed by a luncheon in the Market Hall in Presteigne with the Hon. Arthur Walsh MP presiding. Three hundred navvies had been enlisted for the work on the line, which involved steep gradients and twenty bridges, plus cuttings, culverts and embankments (and all within five miles!). It has been said by local historian Beryl Lewis that the Stagg at Titley was forced to close due to the riotous behaviour of the navvies. At Titley Junction there were complex sidings and crossovers and a 60-lever signal box. The worst setback suffered during the work on this line was the collapse of the Forge Crossing Bridge over the River Arrow in 1873, which was caused by heavy floodwater. Despite this the line was completed within four years. The final cost of work was £50,750, almost £10,000 over budget. When the line was completed Presteigne celebrated, and the town was decorated with banners and the local regiment led decorated wagons through the town. A luncheon was held in a huge marquee behind the Castle Hotel. By March 1876, six trains were running daily from Kington to Presteigne, each one taking 20 minutes to complete the journey. In 1874 the 1st class fare was 11s 1/2 d, 2nd class was 8s 1/4 d and 3rd class was 5s 3/4d. The 3rd class ticket was governed by the statutory price of 1d per mile set by the Government. The exact length of the line was 5 miles 22 chains, hence the 5 3/4d ticket price. Titley Junction was staffed by a stationmaster and four other men, but more than 20 men were needed at Kington station. By 1929 the journey from Presteigne to London Paddington took six hours and there were three trains each way on a weekday. In the 1920s a single 1st class fare to London was 34s 11d, and 3rd was 21s 0d. In the 1930s you could travel to London return from Titley Junction for 19s 8d (about 98p). The train left Titley at 7.24am and arrived in London at 11am via Leominster, Bromyard and Worcester. The return train left Paddington at 5.15pm and arrived at Titley by 9.27pm. By 1939 only three trains were running from Presteigne each day. Following on from the suspension of the passenger service to Presteigne in February 1952 due to national coal shortage, June 2 sees the temporary suspension become permanent with Forge Crossing Halt closing. A freight service continued to run every other day until the line was finally closed for good in 1964. The station site has since been demolished. The station site is now occupied by an industrial estate and a section of trackbed repurposed for use as a main road, the B4355/John Deakins Road. The rest of the trackbed back towards Titley Junction is now a footpath.

Leadership Mohiuddin Ahmed, Dhaka University teacher, is the chief coordinator of Hizb ut-Tahrir in Bangladesh. He was forced into retirement after the organization was banned in 2009. He was charged under Anti-terrorism Act in 2016. Shafiur Rahman Farabi, a leader of the organization was charged in the murder of blogger and secular activist Ananta Bijoy Das in March 2017. The group is alleged to have ties with government, security, and university officials. History In 1993, Dr Syed Golam Maula had gone to London, United Kingdom to pursue his PhD degree where he was introduced to Hizb ut-Tahrir. He also met Nasimul Gani and Kawsar Shahnewaz in London. After returning to Bangladesh they set up the local chapter on 2000 in a coaching centre in Road 6A, Dhanmondi, Dhaka. Hizb ut-Tahrir was banned on 22 October 2009. The group wants to establish a Kaleefa in Bangladesh and does not support democracy in the country. At the time of its ban, the group listed its address as HM Siddique Mansion, 55/A Purana Paltan, 4th Floor, Dhaka. The group supported the 2011 Bangladesh coup d'état attempt by some members of Bangladesh Army who had ties with the group. On 9 February 2013 charges were framed against 6 members of the group including chief coordinator Mohiuddin Ahmed. In October 2014 the members of the group clashed with the Police after they bought out a rally in Muhammadpur, Dhaka. On 15 June 2016 Golam Faizullah Fahim, a member of the group, was arrested after trying to kill a Hindu college teacher in Madaripur. He died in custody after a “gunfight with police,”. The group had promised legal aid to captured members and support to their families if they died in the terror attacks. As of 2016, 650 members of the group were arrested; of whom 400 were able to secure bail. The group conducts protests outside of mosques and has a well maintained online presence. In January 2016 6 members of the group were expelled from Dhaka University. The organization has been trying to recruit students from different educational institutes in Bangladesh. In October 2016 Hizb ut-Tahrir asked the members of Bangladesh Army to fight against Myanmar over the Rohingya crisis. A number of students and professors of North South University in Bangladesh were arrested over ties to this group and terrorist activities. The government had kept an eye on the university after 7 of its students were arrested for involvement in the Murder of blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider. North South University is private university with about 22,000 students in Dhaka. In 2015 printed material of the group was found in the Library of North South University.

It is a lady elegantly dressed from head to toe. They are normally women without an ounce of skin showing. She wears a petticoat, a balaclava, a Domino mask and long gloves. In order not to be recognized, women go so far as to put colored lenses, wigs and camouflage their voices. They do not wear their usual perfume, buy pairs of shoes for the occasion that they will not return and do not move with their vehicle to remain anonymous. They parade in the street and participate in masked balls. There is also a men's suit called Tololo. In the nightclubs, renamed occasionally \\"universities\\", it is the touloulous who invite men to dance. They can not refuse.

The reaction is illustrated by the exchange of lutetium(III) methyl complex with a hydrocarbon (R-H): :(C5Me5)2Lu-CH3 + R-H → (C5Me5)2Lu-R + CH4 This reactivity was first observed by Patricia Watson, a researcher at duPont. The reaction is mainly observed for complexes of metals with d0 configuration, e.g. complexes of Sc(III), Zr(IV), Nb(IV), Ta(V), etc. f-Element complexes also participate, regardless of the number of f-electrons. The reaction is thought to proceed via cycloaddition. Indeed, the rate of the reaction is characterized by a highly negative entropy of activation, indicating an ordered transition state. For metals unsuited for redox, sigma bond metathesis provides a pathway for introducing substituents. The reaction attracted much attention because hydrocarbons are normally unreactive substrates, whereas some sigma-bond metatheses are facile. Unfortunately the reaction does not readily allow the introduction of functional groups. It has been suggested that dehydrocoupling reactions proceed via sigma-bond metathesis.

The album, produced by Francesco Catitti, features 13 songs, including two instrumental tracks and two English-language songs. Preceded by the single \\"Il diario degli errori\\", which placed fourth in the main section of the 67th Sanremo Music Festival, the album debuted at number one on the Italian FIMI Albums Chart. Background In a press conference to launch Anime di carta, Bravi revealed he started writing the album in 2014, and that it was completed in December 2016. Bravi described it as a new beginning after a personal crisis, which followed his mediatic exposure resulting from winning the seventh series of Italian talent show X Factor, the commercial failure of his debut studio album, A passi piccoli, and being dubbed as a \\"dead artist\\" when he was dropped by Sony Music Italy. Anime di carta was his first full-length studio album released for Universal Music Italy, which had previously released Michele Bravi's extended play I Hate Music in 2015. The album is focused on the end of a love story. According to Bravi, he personally met most of the authors contributing to the album, in order to tell them his story and to allow them to write songs he could recognize in. Bravi also contributed writing most of the songs featured in Anime di carta. Discussing the album title, Bravi explained that, while examining his trouble in relating with other people, he felt humans are like paper souls, because \\"paper is an accessible material, it is not valued, it is not precious, it's always at your fingertips.

Educated at Indiana University, she later taught at the University of New Hampshire and became the first chairperson of the Connecticut College botany department. Black was a founding member of the New London Garden Club. Following her death in 1930, the Connecticut College Board of Trustees named the Caroline Black Garden in her honor.  Early life and education  Caroline A. Black was born in Syracuse, New York, on January 28, 1887, to Robert Watts Black (b. 1850 Ontario, Canada d. 1894/5) and Kate Eleanor Knott (b. London, England). Her older siblings Kathleen (Pohlman) and Robert were born in Canada. Caroline and her younger sister Eleanor (Mitchell) were born in the United States. She was a graduate of Walnut Hills High School in Cincinnati, Ohio. She received her B.A. in 1908, M.A. in 1909 and Ph.D in 1912 at Indiana University. Black taught Elementary Botany: A Study of the Fern and Pine, during the 1910 summer term at Indiana University.  Career  Caroline Black joined the University of New Hampshire as an assistant professor of botany in 1911. She was the first female professor at UNH and the first woman on the staff of the New Hampshire Agricultural Experiment Station. Caroline Black accepted the position of assistant professor of botany in the biology department at Connecticut College in New London in 1917. However, she was not entirely satisfied with the proposal and suggested that the college split biology into separate departments of botany and zoology. In 1928 a botanical garden was started on the east side of Mohegan Avenue. In keeping with Professor Black's stance that the campus grounds be an extension of the botany department, the botanical garden served as an outdoor classroom for botany students. Caroline Black collected examples of Connecticut plants for the garden.  Works     Death  While traveling after presenting a paper in Des Moines, Caroline Black contracted spinal meningitis. Two weeks later she died at her brother's home in Cincinnati. On February 6, 1930, the Connecticut College Board of Trustees voted to name the botanical garden in her memory, the Caroline Black Garden.  Legacy  In the 1930s, the New London Garden Club and the New London Horticultural Society raised $500 for a memorial pool and additional plantings, as well as the bronze plaque on a boulder near the pool. In 1999, the Smithsonian Institution included the Caroline Black Garden in its national Archives of American Gardens. In 2001, it was accepted as part of the Gardens for Peace Network, recognizing the unique \\"sense of place\\" that characterizes the Caroline Black Garden.

The fort is on Castle Island, which was connected to the mainland by a causeway in 1928.Roberts, pp. 402-404 Revolutionary War The major event in the Boston area in the first year of the American Revolution was the Siege of Boston from 19 April 1775 to 17 March 1776. The Continental Army under George Washington besieged British forces in the city. The British built several forts as a result, notably on Governor's Island and Noddle's Island.Boston- area Revolutionary forts at American Forts Network In January 1776 artillery captured at Fort Ticonderoga in upstate New York was brought to the Boston area under Henry Knox, providing the Patriot forces with more and larger cannon than they previously had. In the first week of March these weapons were used to engage the enemy. The turning point was the capture and fortification of Dorchester Heights on 5 March, allowing the Continental Army to bombard the British fleet in the harbor. The British evacuated Boston on 17 March under a truce, taking the ships carrying their army to Halifax, Nova Scotia. However, they damaged and destroyed Castle William and its ordnance as best they could, to deny its use to the Patriots. Patriot forces occupied and rebuilt the British forts in the area to the best of their abilities, including Castle William (also called Fort Adams)Shurtleff, pp. 495-496 and the forts on Governor's and Noddle's Islands. A new fort was built in 1776 on Telegraph Hill in Hull and named Fort Independence.Fort Independence (Hull) at American Forts Network In 1778-1780 a force of French Marines from D'Estaing's fleet greatly expanded the fort (probably assisted by Patriot forces), supervised by Chief Engineer du Portail, a French military engineer officer assisting the Continental Army at General Washington's direction.Wade, p. 11Roberts, pp. 408-409 1783-War of 1812 In 1794 Castle William/Fort Adams was repaired to some extent.Fort Independence (Boston) at American Forts Network In 1797 or 1799 (references vary) President John Adams visited the fort. At that time it was renamed Fort Independence and a complete rebuilding was projected. The fort in Hull lost the name and was called either the Allerton Battery or \\"the French fort\\" afterwards. The name \\"Fort Adams\\" went to a fort in Newport, Rhode Island completed in 1799. The newly christened Fort Independence was rebuilt 1801-1803 under the first system of US fortifications and was designed by French-born engineer officer Jean Foncin.Parkman, p. 10 It had 42 guns in the fort, with two outer batteries for six guns each, and could house two companies of about 100 men each, with an external wooden barracks for six additional companies.Fort Independence (Boston) at FortWiki.comWade, p. 242 In 1808-1812 Fort Warren (renamed Fort Winthrop in 1834) was built on Governor's Island under the second system of US fortifications, with 12 guns in the fort and 20 guns in two water batteries.Wade, pp. 139-141, 242Fort Winthrop at FortWiki.comRoberts, p. 413 After the outbreak of the War of 1812 the fort on Noddle's Island was rebuilt with state resources as Fort Strong, named for Governor Caleb Strong.Noddle's Island at American Forts NetworkWade, p. 177 1816-1890 Major new defenses for Boston were built under the third system of US fortifications. In 1833 work was to begin on a rebuilding and expansion of Fort Independence as a granite fort, but commencement was delayed until 1836 due to funding problems cause by an inflation spike. The rebuilt fort was substantially complete by 1848, although repairs and other work continued until 1861.Parkman, pp. 19-20 Another large granite fort was begun in 1833 on George's Island and named Fort Warren; the previous fort of that name on Governor's Island was renamed Fort Winthrop. The new Fort Warren, designed for 300 guns, was completed in 1861.Fort Warren at FortWiki.comRoberts, pp. 411-412 A large central citadel with 16 guns was added to Fort Winthrop and its water batteries were rebuilt for seven guns each.Weaver, pp. 104–114 The supervising builder of Forts Independence, Warren, and Winthrop was Sylvanus Thayer, best known as Superintendent of West Point although he spent most of his career building the Boston forts. Boston Harbor was not attacked in the Civil War; however, the forts served as mobilization centers and Fort Warren was a POW camp. Rearmament of the forts with the new Rodman guns, primarily 15-inch and 10-inch caliber, began during the war, most likely along with some 100-, 200-, and 300-pounder Parrott rifles. The Civil War showed that masonry forts were vulnerable to rifled cannon; the classic example was the siege of Fort Pulaski near Savannah, Georgia in 1862. Also, Parrott rifles had shown an alarming tendency to burst when fired. In the 1870s a major rebuilding of coast defenses was projected. These were centered on earth-protected batteries of Rodman guns along with some Parrott rifles. However, all funding for new fortifications was cut off in 1879 before much had been accomplished in the Boston area. The existing forts were at least partially rearmed with Rodman guns. The external batteries of Fort Winthrop were rebuilt for Rodman guns,Commins, Mabel P., \\"Fort Winthrop: Its Past and Present History\\", The Bostonian, Vol. II, August 1895, pp. 491-501, access date 24 March 2016 (web page title \\"National Magazine\\") and the southeast bastion of Fort Warren was roofed over with massive brick arches. A plaque at the fort states that it was a prototype casemated battery for 15-inch Rodmans, certainly rare in the US and possibly unique. In 1879 Fort Independence was placed in caretaker status and was not further used as a fort, although it was re-occupied as a torpedo and mine depot in the Spanish–American War. Fort Winthrop also went into caretaker status about the same time, also with some re-use in that war. =Endicott period= 12-inch gun M1895 on disappearing carriage M1896, similar to installations at Fort Warren and Fort Heath. 12-inch mortar pit, similar to installations at Fort Banks and Fort Andrews. The Board of Fortifications was convened in 1885 under Secretary of War William Crowninshield Endicott to develop recommendations for a full replacement of existing coast defenses. Most of its recommendations were adopted, and construction began in 1892 on new forts to defend the Boston area. Two underwater minefields also guarded the harbor. Most of the forts were completed by the end of 1904, and the last fort was completed in 1907. The complex geography of the harbor area required seven forts to defend it, including the rebuilding of parts of Fort Warren on George's Island. The six new forts were Fort Banks and Fort Heath in Winthrop, Fort Strong on Long Island, Fort Andrews on Peddocks Island, Fort Revere on Point Allerton in Hull (on the site of the Revolutionary War's Fort Independence), and Fort Standish on Lovells Island.Berhow, pp. 205-206Map of Harbor Defenses of Boston at FortWiki.com The heavy weapons were as follows: Fort Banks had sixteen 12-inch (305 mm) mortars in the \\"Abbot Quad\\" configuration (four pits in a square with four mortars per pit) to concentrate their fire; it was the first mortar battery of the Endicott program completed. Nearby Fort Heath had three 12-inch guns on disappearing carriages. Fort Strong had five 10-inch (254 mm) disappearing guns while Fort Andrews had sixteen 12-inch mortars with the pits in an open-back line to improve reloading. Fort Warren was rebuilt with two 12-inch and five 10-inch disappearing guns, Fort Revere had two 12-inch guns on barbette carriages, and Fort Standish had four 10-inch guns. Medium-caliber weapons included two 4.72-inch (120 mm) Armstrong guns at Fort Strong, two 6-inch (152 mm) guns and two 5-inch (127 mm) guns at Fort Andrews, six 6-inch guns and two 5-inch guns at Fort Revere, and five 6-inch guns at Fort Standish. Smaller weapons were also provided to defend the minefields against minesweepers; these were primarily several models of 3-inch (76 mm) guns with an odd pair of 4-inch (102 mm) guns at Fort Warren. As the new forts entered service, by 1908 Forts Independence and Winthrop (which had a magazine explosion in 1902) were removed from use.Seasholes, p. 326 The battery of two 4.72-inch (120 mm) Armstrong guns at Fort Strong was among many hastily added following the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in 1898.Congressional serial set, 1900, Report of the Commission on the Conduct of the War with Spain, Vol. 7, pp. 3778–3780, Washington: Government Printing Office Most of the Endicott batteries were years from completion, and it was feared the Spanish fleet would bombard the US east coast. In 1917, during World War I, these guns were transferred to Sachuest Point in Middletown, Rhode Island and removed from service in 1919, shortly after the war ended. One is preserved as a memorial in Ansonia, Connecticut.Gun and Carriage cards, National Archives and Records Administration, Record Group 156, Records of the Chief of Ordnance, Entry 712 In 1909 a vast landward defense system was proposed for the Boston area, 70 miles long with its ends at Lynn and Hingham, but none of it was built.Parkman, p. 122 In 1910 four M1890 12-inch (305 mm) mortars were removed from Fort Andrews and sent to the Philippines; two of these survive at Battery Geary, Fort Mills, Corregidor.Berhow, p. 233 These weapons saw action in the Japanese invasion in 1941-42. At Fort Andrews they were replaced by M1908 mortars in 1913.Fort Andrews at FortWiki.com In 1911-12 eight of Fort Banks' sixteen M1886 12-inch (305 mm) mortars were replaced with M1890 mortars; the remainder were replaced in 1915. Also, in 1912-13 the fort's structure was largely replaced due to inferior concrete, and the magazines were expanded.Fort Banks at FortWiki.com In 1914 a one-gun 10-inch (254 mm) battery at Fort Warren was disarmed and abandoned due to inferior concrete; this was Battery Jack Adams inside the stone fort.Fort Warren (2) at FortWiki.com =World War I= The American entry into World War I brought many changes to the Coast Artillery and the Coast Defenses of Boston (CD Boston). Numerous temporary buildings were constructed at the forts to accommodate the wartime mobilization. As the only component of the Army with heavy artillery experience and significant manpower, the Coast Artillery was chosen to operate almost all US-manned heavy and railway artillery in that war. Stateside garrisons were drawn down to provide experienced gun crews on the Western Front. Some weapons were removed from forts with the intent of getting US-made artillery into the fight. 8-inch, 10-inch, and 12-inch guns and 12-inch mortars were converted to railway artillery,US Army Railway Guns in World War I while 5-inch and 6-inch guns became field guns on wheeled carriages.Williford, pp. 92-99 12-inch mortars were also removed to improve reload times by reducing the number of mortars in a pit from four to two. Few railway artillery pieces were mounted and few or none saw action before the Armistice. The remounted 5-inch and 6-inch guns were sent to France, but their units did not complete training in time to see action.Coast Artillery Corps Units in France in WWI The 5-inch guns were removed from service in 1920, but the 6-inch guns were stored and many returned to service in World War II. It appears that four mortars from Fort Banks and six from Fort Andrews were removed for potential service as railway artillery and not returned to the forts. All four of Fort Warren's 10-inch guns were removed for the same reason; these were replaced with different 10-inch guns in 1919. One of Fort Strong's 10-inch guns was removed and not replaced. Three of Fort Revere's 6-inch guns and all four of Fort Revere's and Fort Andrews' 5-inch guns were removed and not replaced (Fort Andrews' 5-inch guns went to Fort Story, Virginia).Fort Revere at FortWiki.com Two of Fort Standish's 6-inch guns were removed, but were remounted in 1919.Fort Standish at FortWiki.com Other weapons were earmarked for transfer, and some of these were dismounted, but were remounted after the war. During and after World War I two- and three-gun antiaircraft batteries armed with M1917 3-inch (76 mm) guns on fixed mounts were built at some forts. Some of these weapons remained in service through early World War II, others were replaced by towed 3-inch guns in the 1930s. References indicate the authorized strength of CD Boston in World War I was 32 companies, including 12 from the Massachusetts National Guard and five from the Rhode Island National Guard. Eight of these companies (four Massachusetts National Guard, one Rhode Island National Guard, and the rest regular army) were transferred to the 55th Artillery (Coast Artillery Corps), which served in France in World War I.Rinaldi, p. 162 =Interwar= One of Fort Duvall's 16-inch M1919 guns. Fire control tower near Fort Duvall. In 1920 a number of weapons deployed in limited quantities, plus the 3-inch gun M1898, were declared obsolete and removed from the forts. These included all Army 5-inch guns, the 4.72-inch Armstrong guns, the pair of 4-inch guns at Fort Warren, and many of the 3-inch guns throughout CD Boston, leading to some redeployments of 3-inch weapons. On 1 July 1924 the harbor defense garrisons completed the transition from a company-based organization to a regimental one, and on 9 June 1925 the commands were renamed from \\"Coast Defenses...\\" to \\"Harbor Defenses...\\". The 9th Coast Artillery was the Regular Army component of HD Boston from 1 July 1924 through 23 February 1944, when it was disbanded. The 241st Coast Artillery was the Massachusetts National Guard component of HD Boston from 30 April 1924 through inactivation on 7 October 1944. A major change in Boston Harbor between the wars required a new fort: the opening of a new ship channel in the northern part of the harbor. To cover this approach Fort Ruckman was built in Nahant from 1918 to 1924, with two 12-inch (305 mm) guns on M1917 long-range barbette carriages that increased the guns' range from to .Fort Ruckman at FortWiki.comBerhow, p. 61 This type of weapon was developed in response to the progressive improvement of dreadnought battleships with better guns and armor. Although the end of World War I meant a general drawdown in US coast defenses, the Boston area was also chosen for one of the first 16-inch (406 mm) gun batteries built by the United States. This was Fort Duvall on Hog Island (now Spinnaker Island), south of the Hull peninsula and thus not visible from the ship channel, built 1919-1927. The fort had two M1919 16-inch (406 mm) guns on a new high-angle barbette carriage that allowed an elevation of 65 degrees and a range of .Fort Duvall at FortWiki.com This increased the opportunity for plunging fire against the decks of enemy warships as they approached. An alternate proposal in 1920 was to build a naval-type turret with two 16-inch guns on Great Brewster Island, but this was not implemented. Calf Island Military Reservation was also considered, but the battery was finally built (without a turret) as Fort Duvall.Parkman, pp. 123-125 =World War II= A casemated 16-inch gun. Early in World War II numerous temporary buildings were again constructed to accommodate the rapid mobilization of men and equipment. The 241st Coast Artillery was activated on 16 September 1940, while three battalions of the 9th Coast Artillery were activated in February and June 1941. The long- abandoned Fort Winthrop was demolished in mid-1941 due to an expansion of Logan Airport. After the Fall of France in 1940 the Army decided to replace all existing heavy coast defense guns with 16-inch guns, but retained long- range 12-inch batteries including Fort Ruckman. Fort Ruckman and Fort Duvall were casemated during World War II for protection against air attack, as were the new 16-inch batteries. In 1942 construction began on the East Point Military Reservation in Nahant, including Battery Murphy (also called Battery 104) with two 16-inch (406 mm) guns; this battery entered service in June 1944, extending Fort Ruckman's coverage of the northern approaches to the harbor.East Point Military Reservation at FortWiki.com Another 16-inch battery, Battery 105 at Fort Dawes on Deer Island in the middle of the harbor, was also built but not armed.Fort Dawes at FortWiki.com An additional 16-inch battery, Battery 106, was proposed for the Fourth Cliff Military Reservation in Scituate but was not built.Fourth Cliff Military Reservation at FortWiki.com The 16-inch batteries were supplemented by new 6-inch (152 mm) batteries. These included heavy earth-covered concrete bunkers for ammunition and fire control, with the guns protected by open-back shields. The guns for these batteries were mostly the 6-inch guns removed in World War I for field service and stored since that war; a new 6-inch gun M1 of similar characteristics was developed when this supply of guns began to run out. Four of these batteries were built in the Boston area, of which three were armed. These were Battery 206 at the East Point Military Reservation, Battery 207 at Fort Dawes (not armed), Battery Jewell (a.k.a. Battery 209) on Outer Brewster Island in the Brewster Islands Military Reservation, and Battery 208 at the Fourth Cliff Military Reservation. Two two-gun 155 mm (6.1 inch) batteries were emplaced in 1942 to quickly provide some defense at key points. These had towed guns on \\"Panama mounts\\", circular concrete platforms to support the guns. These were at the East Point Military Reservation in Nahant and the Sagamore Hill Military Reservation, in Sagamore Beach, Massachusetts at the northern entrance of the Cape Cod Canal.Sagamore Hill at FortWiki.com Another four-gun 155 mm battery was at the Salisbury Beach Military Reservation, in Salisbury, Massachusetts.Salisbury Beach at FortWiki.comSalisbury Beach at American Forts Network The site was transferred to the Harbor Defenses of Portsmouth with the addition of a fire control structure for those defenses. Additional 155 mm batteries in field positions were at Gloucester, Marblehead Neck, Red Rock in Lynn, Fort Heath, Fort Dawes, Fort Andrews, Rocky Point in Plymouth, and Race Point in Provincetown.Butler 2001, pp. 352-354 Four 90 mm gun Anti-Motor Torpedo Boat (AMTB) batteries were built in the Boston area. These had 90 mm dual-purpose (anti-surface and anti-aircraft) guns. Each battery was authorized two 90 mm guns on fixed mounts, two on towed mounts, and two single 40 mm Bofors guns, although the weapons on hand may have varied. These batteries were completed in 1943 at Fort Heath, Fort Standish, Fort Revere, and Great Brewster Island in the Brewster Islands Military Reservation. As new defenses were built, and with little threat to the east coast from enemy air or surface raiders, the heavy weapons at Boston's Endicott-era forts were scrapped in 1942-43. Fort Warren's and Fort Heath's 12-inch guns were the last heavy Endicott weapons to be scrapped, in 1945. Of the 6-inch guns, only the two pairs of pedestal-mounted guns at Fort Andrews and Fort Standish were retained through the end of the war. The removal of most weapons and an Army-wide shift from a regimental to a battalion-based system meant organizational changes in the Boston area. On 23 February 1944 the 9th Coast Artillery was effectively disestablished, and on 7 October 1944 the 241st Coast Artillery was redesignated as the 187th and 241st Coast Artillery Battalions, which themselves were disestablished on 1 April 1945. Personnel from these units were absorbed by HD Boston.Stanton, pp. 489, 492 Some of the Boston-area forts served as POW camps during World War II, notably Fort Andrews. The US Navy also participated in defending the Massachusetts Bay area with net defenses and submarine-detecting indicator loops, including stations in Nahant (Station 1D), Gloucester (Station 1E), Scituate (Station 1C), and Provincetown.Indicator loop websiteEast Point indicator loopsScituate, MA indicator loopsHD Boston, WWII underwater defenses at FortWiki.com Following mobilization in 1940 HD Boston was subordinate to First Army. On 24 December 1941 the Eastern Theater of Operations (renamed the Eastern Defense Command three months later) was established, with all east coast harbor defense commands subordinate to it, along with antiaircraft and fighter assets. This command was disestablished in 1946.Conn, pp. 33-35 =Post World War II= Following the war, it was soon determined that gun defenses were obsolete, and they were scrapped by the end of 1948, with remaining harbor defense functions turned over to the Navy. In 1950 the Coast Artillery Corps and all Army harbor defense commands were dissolved. Today the Air Defense Artillery carries the lineage of some Coast Artillery units. In the late 1940s antiaircraft gun sites were established in the US, first with 90 mm guns and later with 120 mm guns. In the Boston area some of these sites were at or near former Coast Artillery forts. Similarly, the Nike missile systems deployed in the 1950s and early 1960s used some former coastal forts as launch or radar sites, notably the East Point Military Reservation and Fort Strong.Harbor Defenses of Boston at American Forts Netowrk Present As of 2016, the Boston-area forts run the gamut from good preservation to total demolition. Fort Independence is the most accessible and among the best- preserved, and is a public park with guided tours in the summer. It's one of the few well-preserved forts in the area with road access. The former East Point Military Reservation in Nahant is now the Marine Science Center of Northeastern University and is publicly accessible by road.Northeastern University Marine Science Center official website The 16-inch battery in particular can be seen easily, thanks to a berm in front of it that was part of the later Nike missile site. Also in Nahant, Fort Ruckman is partly buried but still visible. Fort Banks in Winthrop is partly buried, but is sometimes open for events such as a Halloween haunted fort. Fort Heath in Winthrop is totally demolished and buried. Almost all of the forts on the harbor islands are part of the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area, with a ferry system that provides access to most of the islands, except in winter.Boston Harbor Islands National Park websiteBoston Harbor Islands site with ferry schedule Fort Warren on George's Island is very well-preserved with guided tours that allow access to most of the fort. It's a rare example of an older fort with Endicott batteries added to it. Fort Standish on Lovells Island and Fort Andrews on Peddocks Island are also accessible by ferry. Fort Strong is not accessible; the bridge to Long Island was demolished in 2014 due to safety concerns, and as of 2016 there are no public activities on the island. Fort Revere in Hull (on the mainland) is preserved as Fort Revere Park; the 6-inch batteries are well-preserved but only traces remain of the Revolutionary War fort and nothing remains of the other Endicott batteries. Fort Duvall on Spinnaker Island has been partly built on as part of a gated community, probably with no public access; one 16-inch emplacement is still visible. Fort Dawes was completely demolished to make room for the Deer Island Waste Water Treatment Plant. The former Fourth Cliff Military Reservation in Scituate is now an Air Force recreation area with some public access; the World War II 6-inch battery and some fire control towers remain. There are numerous other fire control towers in the Boston area, mostly privately owned, with a few at Cape Ann as well.

Its failure in 1990 was one of the largest and costliest failures of the savings and loan crisis. Background and downfall Dade Savings & Loan Association opened in 1934. In 1983, the failing thrift, with 32 branches and $2.2 billion in assets, was acquired by real estate developer David L. Paul for $32 million and the following year was renamed CenTrust Savings & Loan Association. It grew rapidly to become the largest thrift in the southeastern United States, with over $9 billion in assets at its peak in 1989. The bank was placed into government conservatorship in February 1990, with Great Western Bank acquiring the bank's assets in June 1990. CenTrust had $8.2 billion in assets at that time and was the 23rd largest thrift in the country. The failure resulted in an estimated $1.7 billion loss to the government at the time it was seized. Chairman and CEO David Paul was convicted in November 1993 in federal court on 68 counts of tax fraud, obstruction of justice and misapplication of bank funds. He was sentenced to 11 years in prison and required to pay $60 million in restitution and a $5 million fine. He later pled guilty to 29 counts of securities violations. He was released from prison in 2004. The government charged that Paul had used bank funds for personal reasons such as making improvements on his home and paying the expenses on his $7 million yacht \\"Grand Cru.\\" In addition the bank had also bought the sailboat \\"Bodacious\\" for $233,000. The bank acquired a $29 million art collection, including the Peter Paul Rubens painting \\"Portrait of a Man as the God Mars\\" for $13.2 million, which Paul kept at his house. The bank's headquarters were located in the newly built CenTrust Tower (now Miami Tower), a Miami landmark designed by I. M. Pei and featured in the opening credits of the television series \\"Miami Vice.\\" CenTrust's executive offices were opulent, featuring gold-plated plumbing, gold-leaf ceilings, a $1 million Italian marble staircase, and a bulletproof shower door. When the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 was passed it banned the purchase of junk bonds by thrifts and required them to dispose of their holdings by 1995. They were also required to carry the bonds on the bank's books at market value, not face value. The act also disallowed supervisory goodwill by phasing it out through 1995. This resulted in the bank becoming insolvent. CenTrust and Bank of Credit and Commerce International Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), through nominee Saudi businessman Ghaith Pharaon became CenTrust's largest shareholder with 28% ownership. Pharaon was also BCCI's nominee owner of Independence Bank of Los Angeles, as well as National Bank of Georgia, which was formerly owned by Bert Lance, a close friend of former United States President Jimmy Carter. Pharaon was indicted in 1991, and again in 1993 under a revised indictment, but remained a fugitive until his death in 2017. The indictments covered the nominee ownerships of the Georgia and Los Angeles banks, as well as his securities trading activities at CenTrust. BCCI had bought $25 million in subordinated debentures out of a $150 million offering in a sham transaction in 1988, with the securities bought back two months later by CenTrust at a loss. CenTrust and Drexel Burnham Lambert CenTrust was one of the largest buyers of junk bonds (high yield bonds) in the country, with over $1.4 billion on the bank's books at its peak. It was part of Drexel Burnham Lambert's \\"daisy chain\\" of junk bond buyers like Lincoln Savings in Irvine, Imperial Savings in San Diego, Gibraltar Savings in Simi Valley, Silverado Savings & Loan in Denver and Columbia Savings in Beverly Hills. CenTrust had dealings with Lincoln Savings' parent American Continental Corporation when it bought $9 million in Playtex stock from American Continental Corp. and then sold $9 million in stock of Memorex to American Continental Corp. The intent was to boost the prices of the stocks on the thinly traded securities and book bogus profits. Both of the stocks were issued by companies that were clients of Drexel Burnham Lambert. CenTrust and its political influence Paul extensively used CenTrust's money to gain political influence, with its political action committee contributing $328,000 to campaigns and other political causes. Paul was co-chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee with Senator John Kerry (D-MA), with CenTrust contributing $30,000 in political action funds to the committee. The committee also leased Paul's yacht for fund- raisers. Paul met with Kerry five times in 1988, while Kerry was investigating BCCI for money laundering. Paul flew in six chefs from France for a $122,000 \\"Great Chef's Party.\\" Its 61 guests included Senator Kerry. (Kerry later wrote an opinion piece for the New York Times entitled \\"Where Is the S&L; Money?\\") Paul met four times with chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank M. Danny Wall. He also had meetings with Senators Bob Graham (D-FL), John Breaux (D-LA), Tim Wirth (D-CO), Ted Kennedy (D-MA), Joe Biden (D-DE), Alan Cranston (D-CA) and Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-MI).(The latter two senators were also members of the Keating Five.)

It is located in the town of Pelplin in Tczew County (Pomeranian Voivodeship) and is managed by the bishopric of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pelplin. It bears the name of Bishop Stanisław Wojciech Okoniewski (1870–1944), the founder of the museum (pl), who died in Lisbon during World War II. Founded in the Second Polish Republic in 1928 during the interwar period, the collections have been housed in a modern-style building complex since 1988. Museum collections The largest part of the collections are Gothic sculptures from the churches of the former Diocese of Kulm renamed in 1925 as the Bishopric of Pelplin, and also from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Toruń. Late Gothic paintings of \\"Crucifixion\\" from Lignowy (gilded with gold leaf), \\"Flagellation\\" (1380), and \\"Descent from the Cross\\" (1495) from the Cathedral Basilica of St. John the Baptist and John the Evangelist in Toruń, are supplemented with original art by Hermann Hahn (1570–1628) and Andreas Stech (1635–1697).Muzeum Diecezjalne (2017), Sztuka Średniowiecza. Sztuka Nowożytna. Pelplin. The museum received generous financial support from the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage for the preventive conservation of paintings from 1420 to 1695. The Gutenberg Bible (pictured below) held by the museum, originally from the Franciscan monastery in Lubawa, is one of only 48 copies which survived to modern times. Of those, only 20 are complete, and are worth up to $100 million each. It is one of only nine copies surviving in its original 15th century binding,[p. 157] which was added by Henricus Coster of Lübeck. It is printed on both sides of 641 sheets of paper (folios), in two columns measuring 285 mm × 85 mm each, with 40–42 verses, for the total of 1,282 pages of text. Leaves are inserted between some gatherings. See also: During its printing, a loose typesetting sort fell upon a page of this copy and made a mark. This unique feature of the Pelplin Bible enabled scholars to deduce the shape of Gutenberg's type. The binding consists of two beveled oak boards covered in red goat leather, with five brass buttons, corner fittings and buckles fastened to leather straps. The Bible from Pelplin was rescued during World War II by the Polish government, and came to Canada through Paris and London. Kept in a vault at the Bank of Montreal in Ottawa, it was not returned to Poland until 1959. The museum collections of early prints include the priceless manuscript of St. Augustine of Hippo from 425 titled \\"De civitate Dei\\". [Also in:] The collections of the venerated objects of piety contain monstrances and reliquaries from the workshops of Gdańsk, Toruń, and Nuremberg. The collections also include liturgical garments, such as vestments and dalmatics.

Her late father, teacher turned businessman and farmer Elijah Fletcher had owned plantations and valuable real estate as well as a cattle trading business in nearby Lynchburg (receiving cattle from his brother in the state of Indiana and selling them in Virginia), and had helped found St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Lynchburg as well as Ascension Episcopal Church in Amherst. Indiana Fletcher had inherited much upon his death in 1858 (her troublesome brother Lucien received his inheritance circa 1850, during his father's life), but had never married. Her younger sister Elizabeth, had married, but with her husband had squandered much of that inheritance. After the war, her marriage prospects were minimal, and emancipation of formerly enslaved people had greatly changed plantation management. On August 23, 1865, Rev. Williams married Indiana Fletcher in Amherst County, and the newlyweds took the train back to New York. The bishop of New York granted Rev.

In general, profiling refers to the data science process of generating a person's profile with computerized algorithms and technology. There are various platforms for sharing this information with the proliferation of growing popular social networks, including but not limited to LinkedIn, Google+, Facebook and Twitter. Social profile and social data A person's social data refers to the personal data that they generate either online or offline (for more information, see social data revolution). A large amount of these data, including one's language, location and interest, is shared through social media and social network. Users join multiple social media platforms and their profiles across these platforms can be linked using different methods to obtain their interests, locations, content, and friend. Altogether, this information can construct a person's social profile. Meeting the user's satisfaction level for information collection is becoming more challenging and difficult. This is because of too much noise generated, which affects the process of information collection due to explosively increasing online data. Social profiling is an emerging approach to overcome the challenges faced in meeting user's demands by introducing the concept of personalized search while keeping in consideration user profiles generated using social network data. A study reviews and classifies research inferring users social profile attributes from social media data as individual and group profiling. The existing techniques along with utilized data sources, the limitations, and challenges were highlighted. The prominent approaches adopted include Machine Learning, Ontology, and Fuzzy logic. Social media data from Twitter and Facebook have been used by most of the studies to infer the social attributes of users. The literature showed that user social attributes, including age, gender, home location, wellness, emotion, opinion, relation, influence are still need to be explored. =Personalized meta-search engines= The ever-increasing online content has resulted in the lack of proficiency of centralized search engine's results. It can no longer satisfy user's demand for information. A possible solution that would increase coverage of search results would be meta-search engines, an approach that collects information from numerous centralized search engines. A new problem thus emerges, that is too much data and too much noise is generated in the collection process. Therefore, a new technique called personalized meta-search engines emerges, which refers to a user's profile (largely social profile) to filter the search results. A user's profile can be a combination of a number of things, including but not limited to, \\"a user's manual selected interests, user's search history\\", and personal social network data. Social media profiling According to Warren and Brandeis (1890), disclosure of private information and the misuse of it can damage people's feelings and cause considerable damage in people's lives. Social networks provide people access to intimate online interactions; therefore, information access control, information transactions, privacy issues, connections and relationships on social media etc. have become important research fields and are subject to general concern of the public. According to Ricard Fogues and other co- authors, \\"any privacy mechanism has at its base an access control\\", that dictate \\"how permissions are given, what elements can be private, how access rules are defined, and so on\\". Current access control for social media accounts tend to still be very simplistic: there is very limited diversity in the category of relationships on for social network accounts. User's relationships to others are, on most platforms, only categorized as \\"friend\\" or \\"none-friend\\" and people may leak important information to \\"friends\\" inside their social circle but not necessarily users to they consciously want to share the information to. The below section is concerned with social media profiling and what profiling information on social media accounts can achieve. =Privacy leak= A lot of information are voluntarily shared on online social networks, and many people rest assured that different social network accounts on different platforms won't be linked as long as they don't grant permission to these links. However, according to Diane Gan, information gathered online enabled \\"target subjects to be identified on other social networking sites such as Foursquare, Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook and Google+, where more personal information was leaked\\". The majority of social networking platforms use the \\"opt out approach\\" for their features. If users wish to protect their privacy, it is user's own responsibility to check and change the privacy settings as a number of them are set to default option. A major social network platforms have developed geo-tag functions and are in popular usage. This is concerning because 39% users have experienced profiling hacking; 78% burglars have used major social media networks and Google Street- view to select their victims; an astonishing 54% of burglars attempted to break into empty houses when people posted their statuses and geo-locations. =Facebook= Formation and maintenance of social media accounts and its relationships with others are associated with various social outcomes. For many firms, customer relationship management is essential and partially done through Facebook. Before the emergence and prevalence of social media, customer identification is primarily functioned upon information that a firm can directly acquire: for example, it may be through a customer's purchasing process or volunteered act of completing a survey/loyalty program. However, the rise of social media has greatly reduced the process of building a customer's profile/model based on such available data. Marketers now greatly seek customer information through Facebook; this may include a variety of information users disclose to all users or partial users on Facebook: name, gender, date of birth, e-mail address, sexual orientation, marital status, interests, hobbies, favorite sports team(s), favorite athlete(s), or favorite music, more importantly Facebook connections. However, due to the privacy policy design, acquiring true information on Facebook is no trivial task. Often, Facebook users either refuse to disclose true information or set information only visible to friends, Facebook users who \\"LIKE\\" your page are also hard to be identified. To do online profiling of users and to cluster users, marketers and companies can and will access the following kinds of data: gender, the IP address and city of each user through the Facebook Insight page, who \\"LIKED\\" a certain user, a page list of all the pages that a person \\"LIKED\\" (transaction data), other people that a user follow (even if it exceeds the first 500, which we usually can not see)and all the publicly shared data. =Twitter= First launched on the Internet in March 2006, Twitter is a platform on which users can connect and communicate with any other user in just 140 characters. Like Facebook, Twitter is also a crucial tunnel for users to leak important information, often unconsciously, but able to be accessed and collected by others. According to Rachel Numer, in a sample of 10.8 million tweets by more than 5,000 users, their posed and publicly shared information are enough to reveal a user's income range. A postdoctoral researcher from the University of Pennsylvania, Daniel Preoţiuc-Pietro and his colleagues were able to categorize 90% of users into corresponding income groups. Their existing collected data, after being fed into a machine-learning model, generated reliable predictions on the characteristics of each income group. Photo on the right depicts an mobile app called Streamd.in. It displays live tweets on Google Maps by using geo-location details attached to the tweet, and traces the user's movement in the real world. =Profiling photos on social network= The advent and universality of social media network have boosted the role of images and visual information dissemination. Many visual information on social media transmits messages from the author, location information and other personal information. In a study done by Cristina Segalin, Dong Seon Cheng and Marco Cristani, they found that profiling user posts' photos can reveal personal traits such as personality and mood. In the study, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is introduced. It builds on the main characteristics of computational aesthetics CA (emphasizing \\"computational methods\\", \\"human aesthetic point of view\\", and \\"the need to focus on objective approaches\\") defined by Hoenig (Hoenig, 2005). This tool can extract and identify content in photos. =Tags= In a study called \\"A Rule-Based Flickr Tag Recommendation System\\", the author suggests personalized tag recommendations, largely based on user profiles and other web resources. It has proven to be useful in many aspects: \\"web content indexing\\", \\"multimedia data retrieval\\", and enterprise Web searches. Delicious Flickr Zooomr Marketing Nowadays, marketers and retailers are increasing their market presence by creating their own pages on social media, on which they post information, ask people to like and share to enter into contests, and much more. Studies show that on average a person spends about 23 minutes on a social networking site per day. Therefore, companies from small to large ones are investing in gathering user behavior information, rating, reviews, and more. =Facebook= Until 2006, communications online are not content led in terms of the amount of time people spend online. However, content sharing and creating has been the primary online activity of general social media users and that has forever changed online marketing. In the book Advanced Social media Marketing, the author gives an example of how a New York wedding planner might identify his audience when marketing on Facebook. Some of these categories may include: (1) who live in the United States; (2) Who live within 50 miles of New York; (3) Age 21 and older; (4) engaged female. No matter you choose to pay cost per click or cost per impressions/views \\"the cost of Facebook Marketplace ads and Sponsored Stories is set by your maximum bid and the competition for the same audiences\\". The cost of clicks is usually $0.5–1.5 each. Tools =Klout= Klout is a popular online tool that focuses on assessing a user's social influence by social profiling. It takes several social media platforms (such as Facebook, Twitter etc.) and numerous aspects into account and generate a user's score from 1-100. Regardless of one's number of likes for a post, or connections on LinkedIn, social media contains plentiful personal information. Klout generates a single score that indicates a person's influence. In a study called \\"How Much Klout do You Have...A Test of System Generated Cues on Source Credibility\\" done by Chad Edwards, Klout scores can influence people's perceived credibility. As Klout Score becomes a popular combined-into-one- score method of accessing people's influence, it can be a convenient tool and a biased one at the same time. A study of how social media followers influence people's judgments done by David Westerman illustrates that possible bias that Klout may contain. In one study, participants were asked to view six identical mock Twitter pages with only one major independent variable: page followers. Result shows that pages with too many or too fewer followers would both decrease its credibility, despite of its similar content. Klout score may be subject to the same bias as well. While this is sometimes used during recruitment process, it remains to be controversial. =Kred= Kred not only assigns each user an influence score, but also allows each user to claim a Kred profile and Kred account. Through this platform, each user can view how top influencers engage with their online community and how each of your online action impacted your influence scores. Keyhole Data Analytics Several suggestions that Kred is giving to the audience about increasing influence are: (1) be generous with your audience, free comfortable sharing content from your friends and tweeting others; (2) join an online community; (3) create and share meaningful content; (4) track your progress online. =Follower Wonk= Follower Wonk is specifically targeted towards Twitter analytics, which helps users to understand follower demographics, and optimizes your activities to find which activity attracts the most positive feedback from followers. =Keyhole= Keyhole is a hashtag tracking and analytics device that tracks Instagram, Twitter and Facebook hashtag data. It is a service that allows you to track which top influencer is using a certain hashtag and what are the other demographic information about the hastag. When you enter a hashtag on its website, it will automatically randomly sample users that currently used this tag which allows user to analyze each hashtag they are interested in. Online activist social profile The prevalence of the Internet and social media has provided online activists both a new platform for activism, and the most popular tool. While online activism might stir up great controversy and trend, few people actually participate or sacrifice for relevant events. It becomes an interesting topic to analyse the profile of online activists. In a study done by Harp and his co-authors about online activist in China, Latin America and United States. The majority of online activist is male in Latin America and China with a median income of $10,000 or less, while the majority of online activist is female in United States with a median income of $30,000 - $69,999; and the education level of online activists in the United States tend to be postgraduate work/education while activists in other countries have lower education levels. A closer examination of their online shared content shows that the most shared information online include five types: # To fundraise: Out of the three countries, China's activists have the most content on fundraise out of the three. # To post links: Latin American activists have does the most on posting links. # To promote debate or Discussion: Both Latin America's and China's activists posts more contents to promote debate or discussion than American activists do. # To post information such as announcements and news: American activists post more such content than the activists from other countries. # To communicate with Journalist: In this section, China's activists gets the lead. Social credit score in China The Chinese government hopes to establish a \\"social-credit system\\" that aims to score \\"financial creditworthiness of citizens\\", social behavior and even political behaviour. This system will be combining big data and social profiling technologies. According to Celia Hatton from BBC News, everyone in China will be expected to enroll in a national database that includes and automatically calculates fiscal information, political behavior, social behavior and daily life including minor traffic violations – a single score that evaluates a citizen's trustworthiness. Credibility scores, social influence scores and other comprehensive evaluations of people aren't rare in other countries. However, China's \\"social-credit system\\" remains to be controversial as this single score can be a reflection of a person's every aspect. Indeed, \\"much about the social-credit system remains unclear\\". = How would companies be limited by credit score system in China? = Although the implementation of social credit score remains controversial in China, Chinese government aims to fully implement this system by 2018. According to Jake Laband (the deputy director of the Beijing office of the US-China Business Council), low credit scores will \\"limit eligibility for financing, employment, and Party membership, as well restrict real estate transactions and travel.\\" Social credit score will not only be affected by legal criteria, but also social criteria, such as contract breaking. However, this has been a great concern for privacy for big companies due to the huge amount of data that will be analyzed by the system.

In 2019, the Republican Committee of Pettibone's home county of Kootenai County, Idaho, called on the American federal government to allow Sellner to travel to the United States. The move caused considerable controversy within the Republican Party and the State of Idaho. Sellner has said he wants to be allowed into the country so he can marry his fiancée and so they can live together in Post Falls, Idaho, rather than his native Austria. Austrian police expanded their searches of Sellners' property during June 2019 in connection with the Christchurch shootings. This search was later ruled illegal by a judge.https://kurier.at/chronik/wien/hausdurchsuchungen-bei-sellner-waren- laut-gericht-rechtswidrig/400703697 In June 2019, Sellner was permanently excluded from entering the UK on security grounds. Views Wolfgang Ullrich has suggested that there are connections between the worldview of Sellner and the theories of the philosopher Martin Heidegger and the political theorist Carl Schmitt. ITV's documentary film investigation Undercover – The New British Far-Right claimed the existence of undercover footage of Sellner discussing contacts between Generation Identity and white supremacist groups in the United States, but stated that these contacts must be hidden due to public relations. The documentary claimed that Sellner stated that Jews were a problem in the 1920s and made references to the \\"Jewish question\\". Sellner also said that the domination of the American alt-right by the \\"Jewish question\\" is a \\"complete strategical and theoretical failure\\". It claimed he said he was an antisemite in his youth, and that his friends made offensive comments about the Holocaust. He supports The Great Replacement conspiracy theory. Sellner responded by calling the documentary a \\"hit piece\\", and that the statements were taken out of context. In a statement released by Generation Identity and Sellner, they stated that the group wants to preserve European \\"ethno-cultural identity\\" and stated that the group has no hidden agendas. In the context of Donald Trump's presidency and the American alt- right movement, some American media called Sellner alt-right in 2017.

The SOA record format is specified in RFC 1035.  Background  Normally DNS name servers are set up in clusters. The database within each cluster is synchronized through zone transfers. The SOA record for a zone contains data to control the zone transfer. This is the serial number and different timespans. It also contains the email address of the responsible person for this zone, as well as the name of the primary master name server. Usually the SOA record is located at the top of the zone. A zone without a SOA record does not conform to the standard required by RFC 1035.

Arithmetic by species  = Venus flytrap = A closing trap The Venus flytrap can count to two and five in order to trap and then digest its prey. The Venus flytrap is a carnivorous plant that catches its prey with a trapping structure formed by the terminal portion of each of the plant's leaves, which is triggered by tiny hairs on their inner surfaces. When an insect or spider crawling along the leaves contacts a hair, the trap prepares to close, snapping shut only if a second contact occurs within approximately twenty seconds of the first strike. The requirement of redundant triggering in this mechanism serves as a safeguard against wasting energy by trapping objects with no nutritional value, and the plant will only begin digestion after five more stimuli to ensure it has caught a live bug worthy of consumption. The mechanism is so highly specialized that it can distinguish between living prey and non-prey stimuli, such as falling raindrops; two trigger hairs must be touched in succession within 20 seconds of each other or one hair touched twice in rapid succession, whereupon the lobes of the trap will snap shut, typically in about one-tenth of a second. = Arabidopsis thaliana = Arabidopsis thaliana Arabidopsis thaliana performs division to control starch use at night. Most plants accumulate starch by day, then metabolize it at a fixed rate during night time. However, if the onset of darkness is unusually early, Arabidopsis thaliana reduces its use of starch by an amount that effectively requires division. However, there are alternative explanations, such as feedback control by sensing the amount of soluble sugars left is possible, but as of 2015, open questions remain.

She is considered one of the most renowned female solo artists in Uruguay.  Biography  = Early career = Canoura was born in Montevideo. In 1978 she finished her studies in theater at the school of actors Roberto Fontana and Nelly Goitiño. Shortly afterward, her participation in the Conservatorio del Núcleo de Estudios Musicales gave her the opportunity to meet several musicians with whom she would form the group Rumbo. = Rumbo =  Beginnings  Starting at the beginning of 1979 her connection began with musicians Mauricio Ubal, Gonzalo Moreira, Gustavo Ripa, Miguel López and Carlos Vicente, which led to the founding of the group Rumbo. They offered their first performance in the Teatro Astral in June 1979. Their first full-length recording, entitled \\"Para abrir la noche,\\" was edited by the label Ayuí / Tacuabé in 1980. In the following years, they edited the two other albums that would make up their discography: \\"Sosteniendo la pared\\" in 1982 and \\"Otro tiempo\\" in 1985 and offered concerts around Uruguay, performing on several occasions in Buenos Aires as well.  Esa Tristeza  Throughout 1984 and parallel to her career in Rumbo, Canoura began work on a solo album, which featured the artistic production of Jaime Roos and the musical support of the group Repique, which was made up of Andrés Recagno, Alberto Magnone, Gustavo Etchenique, and Carlos \\"Boca\\" Ferreira.Contracara del disco \\"Esta tristeza\\". Orfeo SULP 90764. 1985. This work was completed the following year with the release of Canoura's first solo album, \\"Esa Tristeza.\\"  Breakup  During the band's eight years together, it was subject to censure by the civic-military Uruguayan dictatorship. This censorship was manifested in the cancellation of concerts, or the elimination of parts of the credits from their first Phonogram due to the prohibition imposed upon authors Mario Benedetti, Adela Gleijer, and Diana Reches.Información interior del disco uno de Rumbo. Ayuí / Tacuabé ae229-230cde. 2003. In 1987 Rumbo broke up, beginning the prolific personal careers of Ubal and Canoura. Beginning in the middle of 1987 and throughout the following year, Canoura resumes her artistic activity, performing alongside Esteban Klísich and Mauricio Ubal in two series of shows in Montevideo which received a large public response. = Las Tres = Toward the end of 1988 Canoura begins performances of the show \\"Las tres\\" alongside Estela Magnone and Mariana Ingold (who yielded her spot shortly thereafter to Flavia Ripa). \\"Las tres\\" was a show presented at La Barranca, where each musician performed her own repertoire, accompanied by the other two group members, as well as three other musicians. The album from this show would be edited the following year, achieving a level of sales that would earn it gold status. = Solo career = Following the success of this show, Canoura decided to form her own band and re-launch her album \\"Esa Tristeza,\\" which, due to Repique's lack of free dates, had never been performed live. In 1990 and 1991, the artist offered successful performances of this album in several places throughout Uruguay, including several performances at the Solís Theater in Montevideo. The album made it to the top spots among the country's most sold albums, achieving gold and platinum status. This made Canoura the first female artist to achieve these recognitions.  Puedes oírme  At the end of 1991, she edited her second solo album, entitled \\"Puedes oírme,\\" produced by Jaime Roos. In addition to this musician, Canoura received the instrumental support of Estela Magnone, Hugo Fattoruso, Bernardo Aguerre, Jorge Nocetti, Andrés Recagno, and Nelson Cedrez. This album, edited in vinyl and cassette, was released shortly thereafter as a CD that also included her first solo album. This CD earned golden status. The following year, Canoura represented Uruguay in the Expo Sevilla '92 with the video of the song \\"Detrás del miedo.\\" In the middle of the year, she represented Uruguay on the program ¡Y Vero América va!, by Mexican singer and actress Verónica Castro.  Las cosas que aprendí en los discos  In March 1993, at the Film Festival of the City of Montevideo, the music video of the song \\"Todo lo que quiero\\" was awarded the first prize. Another video clip that achieved success was \\"Nada vale más\\" from the album edited the previous year, \\"Las cosas que aprendí en los discos,\\" for which Canoura was invited to participate in the international programming of MTV. In June, Canoura performed in the Memorial of Latin America in San Pablo, and at the end of the year, she was awarded the Fabini Award for best pop singer at the Solís Theater.  Locas pasiones  Together with Hugo Fattoruso, Canoura performed the show \\"Locas Pasiones\\" at the Solís Theater. The show was recorded live and edited on CD. This disk consisted of a repertoire of boleros and tangos, which was the singer's first endeavor in tango. Canoura later received a new invitation to represent Uruguay, this time in the OTI Festival held in Valencia.  Piaf  Culminating in 1994, Canoura carried out a series of performances with the Symphonic Band of the City of Montevideo. Omar Varela, director of the Italia Fausta theater company, offered her the lead role playing French actress Edith Piaf in a musical/theatrical work based on the book by English author Pam Gems. With good public and critical response, the play was performed for an extensive season during the following year.  Interior  In 1996, she concentrated completely on the recording of her album Interior, for which she invited other important Uruguayan artists, with some of whom she had shared previous projects. Among this group of arrangers, musicians, and composers were Alberto Magnone, Hugo Fattoruso, Bernardo Aguerre, Hugo Jasa, and Esteban Klísich. This work marked her debut as a composer. Following this, she received an invitation from Federico García Vigil, the Director of the Montevideo Philharmonic Orchestra, to participate in a new edition of the show Tango Galas. The show brought together the orchestra's stringed instruments, piano, guitar, bandoneons, singers, and dancers. Other singers like Gustavo Nocetti, Susana Rinaldi, Daniel Cortés, Eladia Blázquez, Darío Solari, and Miguel Ángel Maidana have also performed with the Philharmonic. On this occasion, the Philharmonic and Canoura gave a tour around Brazil, passing through the cities of Porto Alegre, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo.

It was founded at the end of the 15th century as a nunnery by Leonor and María de Silva, daughters of the Count of Cifuentes. It was a cloistered monastery, a Guardia Civil barracks, and finally a university campus after its acquisition by the University of Castilla-La Mancha to expand the facilities of the Faculty of Juridical and Social Sciences. History The convent grew steadily from the end of the 15th century until the middle of the 17th century, creating the typical convent complex articulated around courtyards. From the end of the seventeenth century, there began to be a significant deterioration of the complex, which continued during the eighteenth and especially the nineteenth centuries, when some areas of the convent were lost. After several partial restorations during the twentieth century, the definitive rehabilitation of the convent occurs after its acquisition by the University of Castilla-La Mancha, to complement the university center of San Pedro Mártir . During the rehabilitation works of the complex, various archaeological activities were carried out, especially in the area previously occupied by the nuns' garden, where archaeological remains from different eras were found (Roman, medieval, modern). It is in this phase of the intervention when the important discovery of a Mudejar doorway of the fourteenth century occurs, oriented to the square of Father Juan de Mariana, which must have been part of a civil building. It developed into three bodies: the lower, formed by the lintel door, on which is a dovelage in which rows of bricks alternate with strips of white, green and black tiles, all framed in a border, also in tilework, in which several noble coats of arms appear; the intermediate body, composed of a series of polylobulated blind arches, which intersect; and the upper body, in which there is a large window composed of three arches, also polilobulated, supported by marble columns. Inside the convent, in the area occupied by the garden of the nuns, there is now a patio and a new construction for the expansion of the San Pedro Mártir library and its administrative spaces. The cloister, converted after several reforms into a trapezoid, was originally a single height, and now has two floors. They emphasize the epigraphic decoration that crosses the upper part of the wall of the low cloister and the wooden beams on corbels of rolls. In the upper cloister, which opens several classrooms and offices, appear right wooden feet in the middle panels of each panda, among the large glass windows incorporated in the latest reform. Finally, the presence of ochavated pillars at the corners of the upper gallery of the cloister must be highlighted. In the eastern panda of the cloister is located the church, with its choir that will alter their positions in the nineteenth century because of the deterioration of the church. The difficulties and the abandonment that the building suffered for years meant that the roof of the primitive church was eventually lost, and the choir passed to fulfill the function of a church. Currently, this space functions as a classroom. The building conserves in its interior the original cloister and the main nave of the church, reconverted in Aula Magna. In the exterior, the rehabilitation discovered the only Mudéjar portal of Toledo located in a noble house. Today, 4,000 students come daily to the complex formed by the former convents of San Pedro Mártir and Madre de Dios to study Law, Administration and Management of Companies or Management and Public Administration.

Her real name was Maria di Ormanno degli Albizzi, born in 1428 in Florence. She was the grand- daughter of Rinaldo degli Albizzi, leader of the aristocratic Guelph party; both her father Ormanno and grandfather Rinaldo were exiled when the Medici family returned to Florence in 1434. Maria lived through the turmoil of their condemnation, departure, and conﬁscation of family properties during this exile. In 1438 she entered the convent of Santa Caterina al Monte, known as San Gaggio, located just outside the walls of Florence. The nuns of San Gaggio formed an elite community with an outstanding library inherited from Cardinal Pietro Corsini. They copied their own breviaries and manuscripts for the Augustinian friars at Santo Spirito, Florence, and for the new Augustinian female convent of Santa Monaca. They were also active in the textiles industry and produced fine linens and gold thread.Strocchia, Sharon T. (2009) Nuns and Nunneries in Renaissance Florence, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, pp.126-131.1453 manuscript page with drawing by Ormani Maria di Ormanno degli Albizzi's most notable work is an apparent self-portrait in a breviary (Ms. Cod. 1923, Oesterreichische Nationalbibliothek, Vienna) that she signed and dated 1453. This is the earliest dated self-portrait by a woman artist in Italian Renaissance art. Her image is framed by a scroll with a Latin inscription describing her as \\"handmaid of God, daughter of Orman, and the writer of the book.\\" Her inscription gives her father's first name, but drops the family surname. Maria sketched her countenance in silverpoint in the bas- de-page of the Advent frontispiece, but did not paint the border or most initials. Based on the style, the breviary's other initials and borders were finished by north Italian illuminators in the 1470s. Maria's portrait differs from Florentine secular women's portraits of the mid-fifteenth century in its frontal pose and direct \\"self-possessed\\" gaze.  Convent life and scribal work  Maria did not accompany her family into exile when her father Ormanno and grandfather Rinaldo, but became a novice at San Gaggio on 20 November 1438, with her dowry paid through the Florentine Comune. This convent oﬀered family connections, an aristocratic community, and an extraordinary library. The library inventory lists 132 religious texts, including the letters of Saints Paul, Jerome, and Bernardo, the homilies of Saint John Chrysostom, the sermons of Innocent III, Clement VI, writings by Peter Damian and Jacobus de Voragine, and doctrinal works by Saints Gregory, Ambrose, Augustine, and Jerome. There were decorated missals, breviaries, and bibles that provided models for copy work, as well as grammar books and dictionaries for the nuns’ education. Maria lived in this elite cultural environment with daughters of patrician families including the Medici, Orsini, and Rinuccini until sometime before 1471 when she disappeared from lists of convent residents. In May 1449 the ﬁrst record of Maria di Ormanno degli Albizzi’s scribal work appears. She was copying Bartolomeo da San Concordio’s Summa de casibus conscientiae, known in the vernacular as La Summa Pisanella, for the cleric Antonio di Paolo di Valdambra. Visual close-up of \\"Self-portrait of Maria Ormani degli Albizzi\\"  Self-portrait context  Maria di Ormanno degli Albizzi’s portrait-signature is placed in the central bas-de-page, or bottom of the page, for the ﬁrst Sunday of Advent, which often hosted coats-of-arms, donor portraits, religious narratives, or patron saints and served as an index for the reader. This prominent location and the Latin signature convey Maria di Ormanno degli Albizzi’s pride and her social status as a member of the Florentine elite. A close study of the face and scroll shows they were ﬁrst drawn in silverpoint, and then the nun’s habit, scroll, and border were painted. While it would not be within societal limitations for women to put their work, let alone their self portraits on display for many centuries, Maria di Ormanno degli Albizzi’s social status as a member of the Florentine elite, her references of filial piety in paying homage to her family, as well as doing so within a religious context allowed for her artistry to be displayed. At the same time, the pious pose and inscription echoes the words and gesture of the Virgin Annunciate, making her image imitate the Virgin’s humility, which would have been appropriate for an Augustinian nun.  Self-portrait visual analysis  1453 Manuscript Page with Maria Ormani's Portrait Signature Maria di Ormanno degli Albizzi’s portrait-signature depicts herself in front of a checkered background of gold and blue. Her head is bowed with a slight tilt to the left, and. half of her profile more prominent than the other. Her hands are depicted in a position of prayer, with palms together and fingers lightly touching. Maria is adorned in a traditional black and white nun's habit that frames her face. Her image is framed by a cascading scroll with the text, “Ancilla Jhesu Christi Maria, Ormani ﬁlia, scripsit, MCCCCLIII.” This Latin inscription describes her as, \\"handmaid of God, daughter of Orman, and the writer of the book.\\" Illustrated swirls emanate from the portraits pink border in colors of green, blue, and red. The manuscript itself is adorned with gold-foil and decorative swirls within a thick border surrounding the main text. The text is transcribed in traditional black and red ink with a thin blue border separating it from the manuscript's illumination. References  Further reading  # Bradley, John William.

The disorder was first described in 1970 by Gianotti in a case series of five children. CGPD is more common in boys than girls. Signs and symptoms CGPD is characterized by the presence of small, raised, dome-shaped, flesh-colored or yellow-brown papules primarily distributed around the mouth, eyes, and nose. Affected children may also have papules on the ears, eyelids, cheeks, forehead, and nose. CGPD skin lesions rarely affect areas of the skin other than the face. Cause The cause of CGPD is unknown. Diagnosis The approach to diagnosing CGPD is controversial. Certain dermatologists suggest that ruling out infectious and allergic causes of similar skin eruptions and a skin biopsy demonstrating features consistent with CGPD is adequate for diagnosis. In contrast, other dermatologists advocate for performing a complete history and physical examination and obtaining laboratories and appropriate imaging to rule out cutaneous sarcoidosis. On microscopy, non-tuberculous granulomas with surrounding lymphocytes clustered around hair follicles may be seen; additionally, infiltrates of epithelioid macrophages, lymphocytes, and giant cells may also be seen. Several conditions exhibit skin findings similar to those of CGPD. These conditions include perioral dermatitis, acne vulgaris, granulomatous rosacea, contact dermatitis, folliculitis, atopic dermatitis, cheilitis, medication-induced acneiform eruptions, lupus miliaris disseminatus faciei, benign cephalic histiocytosis, granulosis rubra nasi, xanthomas, zinc deficiency, glucagonoma, cutaneous sarcoidosis, and scabies. Treatment Treatment recommendations for CGPD vary and may include observation without treatment, stopping the use of topical corticosteroids, and the use of topical or oral antibiotics as well as isotretinoin. Topical antibiotics such as metronidazole and erythromycin have been used for CGPD. Oral antibiotics of the tetracycline class such as minocycline, doxycycline, and tetracycline have been recommended for CGPD. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole has also been used. The use of oral systemic antibiotics is limited by side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity of the skin to sunlight. Tetracycline antibiotics are not recommended for children under the age of 8 since tetracyclines are known to deposit in teeth (thereby staining them) and impair bone growth in children. The use of calcineurin inhibitor creams such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus on the skin is controversial and results have been mixed. Certain studies found the use of topical calcineurin inhibitors led to resolution of CGPD whereas others saw incomplete resolution or prolonged symptoms. Topical azelaic acid has been used successfully to treat CGPD. Immediate discontinuation of topical corticosteroids is recommended since corticosteroids are thought to worsen CGPD. Prognosis CGPD is known to be a temporary skin disease with a benign course. The skin papules typically resolve after a few months to a few years. After CGPD resolves, the skin may return to normal without scarring or may have small atrophic depressions with collagen loss, milia, or small pit-like scars. Epidemiology CGPD occurs most often in children of Afro-Caribbean descent before puberty though reports of this disease occurring in Asian and Caucasian children have also been described. Due to the limited number of reported cases, it remains controversial whether CGPD occurs more often in African children than in children of other races. CGPD is more common in boys than girls. History Gianotti et al. first described CGPD in five Italian children in 1970. In 1990, Williams et al. described a similar skin eruption in five children of Afro-Caribbean descent and coined the proposed term \\"facial Afro-Caribbean childhood eruption (FACE)\\". Subsequently, another article by Katz and Lesher first introduced the term CGPD since some reported cases were not found in children of Afro-Caribbean descent and to avoid confusion with perioral dermatitis.

Life Larson earned her BA in English from Oberlin College, her MFA in visual arts at Rutgers, State University of New Jersey and participated in the Whitney Museum of American Art Independent Study Program. She is a professor in the School of Art + Design at Ohio University.  Art career  Larson identifies herself as a photographer, although her work includes film, video, digital media, and writing. As part of her practice, Larson explores the assumption of photography's purported objectivity by taking documentary and poetic approaches in her work. She deals with issues related to the medium of photography, domestic spaces, her relation to female bodies, and photography's vernacular histories, among others. A recurrent topic in Larson's work is the paranormal. In her video Electric Girls and the Invisible World, she follows a group of five teenage girlfriends and their mysterious connection to the 19th century medium Eusapia Palladino, presenting reflections on female adolescence, melancholy, and longing. Electric Girls was supported by a post- production residency for film at the Wexner Center for the Arts. Larson's work challenges the notion of the medium that “never lies.\\" In her “Domestic Interiors” and “My Dark Places” series, she photographs dollhouse interiors, playing with the viewer's perception of scale.Carol Armstrong, Through a Doll's Eye: Laura Larson’s Domestic Interiors, Documents, Issue 11, 1998. Larson's “Well-Appointed” series depicts the interior of historical homes, focusing on the lavish furniture and raising questions about wealth and power. Her series “Complementary” captured traces of occupancy in hotel rooms after checkout and before maid service. Larson used the interrelationship of First and Second Wave Feminism as a jumping off point for these four bodies of work, which center around mise en scene, and how the rooms themselves tell a story.Margaret Sundell, Interview with Margaret Sundell, Photographs 1996-2012 Lennon, Weinberg Gallery, July 10 to September 13, 2014. Two related series “Apparition” and “Asylum” focus on the paranormal. Larson created her own spirit photographs, using cigarette smoke to reference the staged spirit photographs of the 19th century. Larson's focus shifted to the representation of the body with her series “Ectoplasm,” referencing the both humorous and moving 19th century photographs of female mediums. Her book and curated exhibition Hidden Mother (2017) uses portraits of children with \\"hidden mothers,\\" the term for the practice of concealing a mother's body as she supported her child during the long exposures demanded by early photographic technology, to present her personal experience of motherhood.

Description Anthurium schlechtendalii is found from Mexico to Costa Rica. It is a large herbaceous plant with dark green leaves, it arises from a bunch of white cord-like roots and its flower is a dark purple bract(spathe). It has fruits and when ripe they have a similar appearance to small red berries. They tend to live in wet forests, rocky hillsides or outcrops on trees. A. schlectendalii at Cayo District, Belize Anthurium schlechtenalii has a long, slender and brown spadix (which has pencil-like structure) that arises from the base which is about 70 cm long. It has brown bumps on the spadix which are considered its fruits which develop a lot of tiny flowers. The genus Anthurium has about 500 species, some are used as medicinal species meanwhile others are used as ornaments. The name Anthurium comes from classical Greek which translates to 'tail flower.' This species originated from Peru, Mexico, Bolivia, and Brazil.  Treatment methods  For most treatments, three leaves of the plant are plucked, boiled in 2 gallons of water for 10 minutes, and used in a warm bath. Local healers say that the cola de faisan can be used on swollen tonsils; for this the treatment the leaves are mashed with oil, heated, and placed on the neck two times a day. For cramps, muscle spasms or paralysis, the affected area is covered with a blanket and placed over the steam of the boiling decoction. To reduce swelling and inflammation, such as swollen breasts, back pain or joint pain, the leaves are mashed and applied to the affected area. The poultice \\"will stick to the affected part and can be worn all day\\" [B3507; Arvigo and Balick, 1998). For back pain or muscle spams, the center vein of the leaf is mashed and applied to the affected area, and a hot water bottle is placed over it for one hour. For urinary infection, roots of A. schlechtendalii are retrieved and boiled in 3 cups of water for 10 minutes; then sips of the liquid are taken for 24 hours until the condition has improved. The species is also used as a (when a dog is out of control): A handful of the roots is boiled in one quart of water for 10 minutes. One-half pint of the liquid is then force-fed the dog three times a day until symptoms abate.

Biography The Wild Flowers of California (1902), p. 65; Matilija poppy, Romncya coulteri Mary Elizabeth Parsons was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1859. She studied art in San Francisco in the 1890s, where Alice Brown Chittenden was her sketching partner. In the 1890s, Parsons hiked around California with the botanical artist Margaret Warriner Buck, with a view to publishing a book about California flora. The result was the very successful The Wild Flowers of California: Their Names, Haunts, and Habits (1897), written by Parsons with over 100 illustrations engraved from Buck's pen-and- ink drawings. It went through many printings and several editions and was still being reprinted into the 1950s. Parsons intended her book to complement Mrs. William Starr Dana's very successful How to Know the Wild Flowers (1893) by emphasizing plants that were unknown in the eastern United States where Mrs. Dana lived. With Mrs. Dana's permission, she used the same plan of arranging the flowers by color. The botanist Alice Eastwood and the nurseryman Carl Purdy served as advisers on the project. For the 1906 edition, a replacement set of printing plates had to be made when the existing set was destroyed in the San Francisco earthquake. This edition was printed in several versions, one of which had the illustrations printed very lightly so that they could be hand-colored afterwards by the buyer.

The service uses algorithms to analyze live game data to determine if games are exciting, identifying events like rivalries or upsets. The opinions of the service's 25,000 \\"Super Fans\\" add a subjective influence to the overall excitement rating of each game. The ratings for each game range from zero to infinity, bucketed into OK, GOOD, HOT, and EPIC ranges. When a game hits an excitement \\"crescendo\\", the website sends email and text alerts to subscribers. Their sole competitor is Thuuz. Despite having a consumer- facing website, the company focuses on licensing excitement data via its API to larger companies. Comcast is one such customer, and the company's data is used by millions of Xfinity X1 subscribers. The API also includes DVR Extender, Natural Language, and Video Highlight functionality. Other customers include Bleacher Report, CBS Sports, Telstra Communications, and Turner Sports.

Paper Street is an allusion to fictitious entries on maps.  Purpose in novel  Tyler Durden creates and uses Paper Street Soap Co. as an anarchic and simultaneously capitalistic enterprise that produces soap out of rendered human fat stolen from the dumpsters of liposuction clinics. The soap is then sold by Durden to retailers, particularly department stores, as a high-end product. The money made from these sales serves at first as a side income to Durden, who works part-time as a projectionist and waiter, and later becomes his sole source of revenue as the members of his Fight Club become the dedicated workers of his soap factory – the soap production becomes a full- time, round the clock enterprise that pays for the expenses to house and feed its members and to finance the guerilla tactics of Project Mayhem.  Cultural impact  Numerous web pages have been created under the name to pay homage to the fictional company and story of origin and often sell t-shirts with the name and related quotes from the film adaptation.

On an abstract level, mesh smoothing is concerned with the design and computation of smooth functions f : S rightarrow R^d on a triangle mesh. Mesh fairing does not just slightly smooth the function f in order to remove the high frequency noise. It also smooths the function as much as possible in order to obtain, e.g., an as- smooth-as-possible surface patch or an as-smooth-as-possible shape deformation.Polygon Mesh Processing, Botsch et al. 2010 The goal of surface fairing is to compute shapes that are as smooth as possible. How to actually measure smoothness or fairness obviously depends on the application, but in general fair surfaces should follow the principle of simplest shape: the surface should be free of any unnecessary details or oscillations.Functional optimization for fair surface design, Moreton, H. P. and Séquin, C. H., Proc. of ACM SIGGRAPH 1992; Variational Surface Modeling, Welch, W. and Witkin, A., Proc. of ACM SIGGRAPH 1992 This can be modeled by a suitable energy that penalizes unaesthetic behavior of the surface. A minimization of this fairness energy—subject to user-defined constraints—eventually yields the desired shape. Example applications include the construction of smooth blend surfaces and hole filling by smooth patches.

The novel is O'Brien's 23rd fictional publication. The novel follows an imaginary Balkan war criminal, Dr. Vlad, as he interacts with women in an Irish village. The past actions of the main character closely resemble the war crimes of the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadžić. The title of the novel refers to a European theatre company's performance art which commemorated his 11,541 victims with 11,541 red chairs.  Themes  Like much of O'Brien's earlier works, such as her famous The Country Girls, the novel views life through the eyes of girls and women in rural Ireland. The novel explores \\"how women are punished for their sins, or suffer for their innocence\\", a theme used in several other of O'Brien's works. She also explores the stories of immigrants. Dr. Vlad is an immigrant into the Irish community, and his relationship to the Irish natives is a dark-comic focus. Even before he arrives on the scene, O'Brien has populated the town with other resident workers from Poland, Burma and Czechoslovakia. She also explores the story of immigration to the city of London, where she examines details in the \\"shadow of warfare and forced emigration\\", digging into the backgrounds of individual people \\"patiently bring[ing] to life the stories and histories, the terrors and hopes of London’s population of exiles, immigrants, and indentured visitors.\\"  Style  James Wood of The New Yorker describes the narration of the novel as \\"a loose and chatty free indirect discourse, edging comically (in good Irish literary fashion) toward stream of consciousness.\\" Joyce Carol Oates likened the novel to Joyce and Kafka in style, and multiple critics call this style very effective. Julie Myerson described the prose as \\"sly perfection\\" which \\"changes tense (sometimes within a single chapter) or slides out of one character’s headspace and – with an absolutely convincing logic all of her own – into another.\\"  Critical reception  Reception of the novel was generally favourable. Novelist Philip Roth called it “her masterpiece”. New York Times reviewer and novelist Joyce Carol Oates favorably described the novel as \\" boldly imagined and harrowing\\". For Oates, the novel's subject could have leant itself to suspense, mystery or a thriller, instead O'Brien focuses the novel on \\"meditation and penance.\\" In The New Yorker James Wood concludes that the novel is simply \\"remarkable\\". Examining the novel in the context of her other works, Wood described the novel as a successful \\"late style\\" novel which witnesses her \\"impatience with formal or generic proprieties; a wild, dark humor; a fearlessness in assertion and argument; a tonic haste in storytelling, so that the usual ground-clearing and pacing and evidentiary process gets accelerated or discarded altogether, as if it were (as it so often can be) mere narrative palaver that is stopping us from talking about what really matters.\\" Several reviewers emphasized how the novel moves between different genres, expectations and styles of novel. Washington Post reviewer Ron Charles described the novel as \\"leav[ing] one in humbled awe\\" because of O'Brien's \\"dexterity [and] her ability to shift without warning — like life — from romance to horror, from hamlet to hell, from war crimes tribunal to midsummer night’s dream.\\" NPR reviewer Maureen Corrigan called the novel \\"one of her best and most ambitious novels yet\\" which is both \\"personal and political; charming and grotesque; a novel of manners and a novel of monsters.\\" Other reviewers gave high marks for the novel. The Guardian's Julie Myerson \\"a truly gripping read.\\" She examines a number of striking features in the novel, but concludes that \\"The real genius of this novel – and I don’t use the word lightly – is to take us right up close to worlds that we normally only read about in newspapers, to make us sweat and care about them, and at the same time create something that feels utterly original, urgent, beautiful.\\" Another NPR reviewer, Annalisa Quinn also praised the novel, describing it as highlighting how \\"O'Brien captures an extraordinary and almost holy innerness in each of her characters, however minor, and then plants those characters amidst the terrible velocity, the terrible pull of world events.\\" Reviewing the novel for the Financial Times, Clair Messud describe the novel as \\"as lyrically arresting as ever, her vision as astute, and as delicate\\" yet at the same time striking for its strength of content: \\"interweaving of the near-mythical and the urgent present, and for its unflinching exploration of the complex and lasting effects of human brutality.\\"  References  2015 Irish novels Novels by Edna O'Brien Faber and Faber books ","title":"The Little Red Chairs"},{"id":"53376481","text":"The Crown is the seventeenth studio album by American rapper Z-Ro.

In 2013, he was elected to the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Education Alejandro Aballay earned his bachelor's degree in Pharmacy from Juan A. Maza University, in Mendoza, Argentina, in 1994. During this time, he worked as an undergraduate student at Nacional de Cuyo University, in Mendoza, Argentina, where he studied soil bioremediation. He finished his M.S. equivalent studies in 1995 and started exploring the machinery that governs early steps in endocytosis at Nacional de Cuyo University. During this period, he received a World Bank fellowship to complement his studies in endocytosis by working as a summer student for two consecutive years at Washington University, in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1998, he earned his Ph.D. at Nacional de Cuyo University and received a Pew Fellowship to move to St. Louis, where he continued his studies in endocytosis at Washington University. Work In 1999, following an interest in bacterial pathogenesis he developed while studying the intracellular transport of Brucella abortus when he was a graduate student, he moved to Boston to join the Ausubel laboratory at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Aballay moved to Durham in 2002 to join the Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, where his studies focus on what makes bacteria pathogenic and hosts resistant. In the Ausubel laboratory, Dr. Aballay developed a novel pathogenesis system utilizing the simple well-studied nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the common human bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica. Salmonella is well known for its ability to cause food poisoning. Nematodes like C. elegans eat bacteria and surprisingly C. elegans is killed when it is provided S. enterica as a food source. This killing is accompanied by a persistent infection of S. enterica in the C. elegans intestine. Importantly, Dr. Aballay has shown that several well-studied S. enterica virulence factors required for causing disease in mammalian hosts are also required for C. elegans killing. This validates the use of C. elegans as a host to model Salmonella infection in mammals, including humans. Dr. Aballay's laboratory takes advantage of the compromise between complexity and tractability of the C. elegans–S. enterica pathogenesis model. The focus of the laboratory is to use C. elegans as a host to screen thousands of bacterial clones from mutagenized libraries to identify novel Salmonella virulence factors and to address how they alter host signaling pathways. Since several components of innate immunity are conserved among different organisms throughout evolution, his group is also exploiting the genetic and genomic resources available for C. elegans to study the basis of the immune response.

Biography  Julio E. Suárez was one of the pioneers of comic strips in Uruguay. Born in Salto, Uruguay, he traveled to Montevideo to study architecture in 1927, but he quickly abandoned his studies. In that time he began career with newspapers and his relationship with the short-lived Uruguayan newspaper, El Nacional, where he published parliamentary notes. He published his first drawings (Wing y Roncadera) in \\"El Plata\\", before he moved to the magazine \\"Mundo Uruguayo\\" in 1934 where he published two series of drawings, “Ríase o no” (laugh or not) and “Contra-refranes” (contradictions). He worked with Mundo until 1950. Along with his work as an illustrator, he wrote scripts starring his character \\"Peloduro\\" for the radio broadcast station CX 24 in Montevideo and became an illustration teacher in the school of applied arts. He also created the character “Marieta Caramba” voiced by actress Jebele Sand on CX 30 Radio Nacional. Throughout his career he used various pseudonyms among them “pelo”, “Marcos Tuáin” “Pepe Repepe” and “El Mono”. However, his most widely used names were “JESS” and “peloduro”. He died in 1965.  Homages  Since 1996 el Museo de Humor y la Historieta, (Comic and Humor Museum), in the city of Minas (Comic and Humor Museum), Uruguay which was founded in 1992, carries his name, as well as a street in Montevideo. The museum also issues a \\"Peloduro\\" award. In 1967 after his death, two compilations of his works were published “Diccionario del Disparate” and “Comentarios internacionales de “El Pulga”.

In addition to the anchor stores, the town center features a downtown area with a Main Street that contains several dining, retail, and service establishments. The downtown area has a Town Square, which is a grassy area surrounded by water features and a custom fire wall. The Town Center has many businesses from dinning at Founding Farmers to Veterinary & Grooming at Heart + Paw. The King of Prussia Town Center is part of a larger development known as the Village at Valley Forge, a 122-acre mixed-use development which consists of the retail development along with apartments, townhouses, condominiums, office space, and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's \\"Specialty Care and Surgery Center\\". History In the late 1990s, developer Dennis Maloomian acquired a 138-acre golf course near the King of Prussia mall and planned a mixed-use residential and retail development that would include a town center for King of Prussia. The proposed development needed to be rezoned, and Maloomian attended Upper Merion Township monthly meetings over a course of 18 months in order to get the golf course rezoned so he could build his development, which was to feature residential and retail development within a golf course that would serve as a buffer. Both township officials and local residents were opposed to the plans. Maloomian would go to court and plead his rights as a property owner were being violated. After several failed appeals, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in Maloomian's favor in 2003. There were two plans that existed for the proposed development. Maloomian went ahead with a different plan that would create a suburban downtown that would have apartments, townhouses, and offices; he had unsuccessfully attempted to build a similar development at the former site of the Garden State Park Racetrack in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Despite this, Maloomian had to continue to convince township planners to allow him to build his town center development. In December 2004, he showed township planners a similar development in Reston, Virginia. In 2006, Upper Merion Township and Maloomian reached an agreement that allowed the town center to proceed forward. Construction was delayed by the Great Recession in 2008. The first part of the town center was completed in 2014 with the opening of a Wegmans grocery store. In April 2015, JBG bought 20 acres from Maloomian to build the lifestyle center. The lifestyle center opened over the course of summer 2016. Both the Nordstrom Rack and LA Fitness anchor stores relocated from a shopping center near the King of Prussia mall. Construction of the King of Prussia Town Center cost $100 million. Offices are being constructed and residential areas are in development as part of the larger Village at Valley Forge. In 2017, JBG put the King of Prussia Town Center up for sale.

The village was first established about 130 years ago by Kha Hok families, one of the Khmu ethnic sub-groups. Like many other upland inhabitants in Luang Prabang, the livelihood and culture of ethnic groups such as Lao Loum, Kha Hok, Yao and Hmong in Ban Thapene is dependent on natural resources.  Geography  Ban Thapene is about 29 kilometers southwest of Luang Prabang. The topography of Ban Thapene is composed of mountains, small valleys, streams and waterfalls with elevations ranging between 450–930 metres. The village is adjacent to Ban U and Nong Heo villages to the north, Ban Khokmanh and Pa Si villages to the west, Ban Yang village to the south and Long Lao Kau and Long Lao May villages to the east.  Ethnicity and demography  Ban Thapene is home to groups such as Lao Loum, Kha Hok, Yao and Hmong. In December 2016, Ban Thapene had 139 households with 637 persons, in which Kha Hok and Lao Loum were the majority.  Natural resources  The Kuang Si Waterfall, Ban Thapene Total natural area of Ban Thapene which was legitimized by local authorities with support of SPERI and CCFD in 2016 is approximately 1,775.59 hectares. This area includes different categories of forest and land, e.g., community spirit preserve forestland, community protected forestland, community and family usage forestland, agricultural land, housing and infrastructure land (e.g., primary school, clinic and wat), tourism land, and military land. Ban Thapene has an inter-connection of groundwater, small streams and waterfall. The 60 meter- high Kuang Si Fall is a part of the Huoi Si stream, which has its source in the Phu Nam Ork Mount in the Luang Prabang Range. The Huoi Si stream flows through Nam Uok and Thapene villages before flowing into the Mekong River. Natural resources, notably forests play a vital role to the material and spiritual values of the ethnic groups in Ban Thapene. Forest and land, especially the spirit forests like Nam Ork Mount and Hua Tat Mount, are spaces for ethnic groups in Ban Thapene to practice their customary beliefshttp://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/social-practices-rituals-and-00055 via yearly and seasonal ceremonies to worship the nature spirit. Ban Thapene has established its community regulation based on customary law and government policies in order to preserve such livelihood and cultural sites for future generations.  Economy  268x268px Before 1994, the livelihood of families in Ban Thapene was largely based on natural resources, upland farming or rotational shifting cultivation, planting wet rice, raising cows and buffalo, and collecting non-timber forest products. Afterward, because of the Lao policy of banning shifting cultivation and establishing protected areas to preserve the Kuang Si watershed and develop the Kuang Si tourism area, traditional practices have been partly converted to small-scale tourism services near the Kuang Si Falls. By 2014, some families in Ban Thapene still keep plots for farming. Ban Thapene plans these plots into the community managed area for agricultural production. Besides the regular income generated from tourism services, villagers also make items, e.g., traditional brocade, clothing, baskets, and wooden arts for selling as souvenirs to tourists. These products are largely made from non-timber forest products collected from community use forests and family forests after the fallow period.

Because nanotechnology is a recent development, the health and safety effects of exposures to nanomaterials, and what levels of exposure may be acceptable, are subjects of ongoing research. Of the possible hazards, inhalation exposure appears to present the most concern, with animal studies showing pulmonary effects such as inflammation, fibrosis, and carcinogenicity for some nanomaterials. Skin contact and ingestion exposure, and dust explosion hazards, are also a concern. Guidance has been developed for hazard controls that are effective in reducing exposures to safe levels, including substitution with safer forms of a nanomaterial, engineering controls such as proper ventilation, and personal protective equipment as a last resort. For some materials, occupational exposure limits have been developed to determine a maximum safe airborne concentration of nanomaterials, and exposure assessment is possible using standard industrial hygiene sampling methods. An ongoing occupational health surveillance program can also help to protect workers.  Background  Optical micrographs of several nanomaterials present in aerosol particles. From left, silver nanoparticles, nickel nanoparticles, and multiwalled carbon nanotubes Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter at the atomic scale to create materials, devices, or systems with new properties or functions, with potential applications in energy, healthcare, industry, communications, agriculture, consumer products, and other sectors. Nanomaterials have at least one primary dimension of less than 100 nanometers, and often have properties different from those of their bulk components that are technologically useful. The classes of materials of which nanoparticles are typically composed include elemental carbon, metals or metal oxides, and ceramics. According to the Woodrow Wilson Center, the number of consumer products or product lines that incorporate nanomaterials increased from 212 to 1317 from 2006 to 2011. Worldwide investment in nanotechnology increased from $432 million in 1997 to about $4.1 billion in 2005. Because nanotechnology is a recent development, the health and safety effects of exposures to nanomaterials, and what levels of exposure may be acceptable, is not yet fully understood. Research concerning the handling of nanomaterials is underway, and guidance for some nanomaterials has been developed. As with any new technology, the earliest exposures are expected to occur among workers conducting research in laboratories and pilot plants, making it important that they work in a manner that is protective of their safety and health. A risk management system is composed of three parts. Hazard identification involves determining what health and safety concerns are present for both the nanomaterial and its corresponding bulk material, based on a review of safety data sheets, peer-reviewed literature, and guidance documents on the material. For nanomaterials, toxicity hazards are the most important, but dust explosion hazards may also be relevant. Exposure assessment involves determining actual routes of exposure in a specific workplace, including a review of which areas and tasks are most likely to cause exposure. Exposure control involves putting procedures in places to minimize or eliminate exposures according to the hierarchy of hazard controls. Ongoing verification of hazard controls can occur through monitoring of airborne nanomaterial concentrations using standard industrial hygiene sampling methods, and an occupational health surveillance program may be instituted. A recently adopted risk management method is the Safe by design (SbD) approach. It aims to eliminate or reduce risks of new technologies including nanotechnology, at the design stage of a product or production process. Anticipation of risks is challenging because some risks could emerge only after a technology is implemented (at later stages in the innovation process). In the later cases, the application of other risk management strategies based on non-design principles need to be applied. It considers the purposes and constrains for implementation of SbD approaches in the industrial innovation process and on the basis of those, establish optimal workflows to identify risks and propose solutions to reduce or mitigate them as early as possible in the innovation process called Safe by Design strategies.  Hazards  = Toxicity =  Respiratory  A scanning electron microscope image of bundles of multiwalled carbon nanotube piercing an alveolar epithelial cell. Inhalation exposure is the most common route of exposure to airborne particles in the workplace. The deposition of nanoparticles in the respiratory tract is determined by the shape and size of particles or their agglomerates, and they are deposited in the alveolar compartment to a greater extent than larger respirable particles. Based on animal studies, nanoparticles may enter the bloodstream from the lungs and translocate to other organs, including the brain. The inhalation risk is affected by the dustiness of the material, the tendency of particles to become airborne in response to a stimulus. Dust generation is affected by the particle shape, size, bulk density, and inherent electrostatic forces, and whether the nanomaterial is a dry powder or incorporated into a slurry or liquid suspension. Animal studies indicate that carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers can cause pulmonary effects including inflammation, granulomas, and pulmonary fibrosis, which were of similar or greater potency when compared with other known fibrogenic materials such as silica, asbestos, and ultrafine carbon black. Some studies in cells or animals have shown genotoxic or carcinogenic effects, or systemic cardiovascular effects from pulmonary exposure. Although the extent to which animal data may predict clinically significant lung effects in workers is not known, the toxicity seen in the short-term animal studies indicate a need for protective action for workers exposed to these nanomaterials. As of 2013, further research was needed in long-term animal studies and epidemiologic studies in workers. No reports of actual adverse health effects in workers using or producing these nanomaterials were known as of 2013. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) dust is considered a lung tumor risk, with ultrafine (nanoscale) particles having an increased mass-based potency relative to fine TiO2, through a secondary genotoxicity mechanism that is not specific to TiO2 but primarily related to particle size and surface area.  Dermal  Some studies suggest that nanomaterials could potentially enter the body through intact skin during occupational exposure. Studies have shown that particles smaller than 1 μm in diameter may penetrate into mechanically flexed skin samples, and that nanoparticles with varying physicochemical properties were able to penetrate the intact skin of pigs. Factors such as size, shape, water solubility, and surface coating directly affect a nanoparticle’s potential to penetrate the skin. At this time, it is not fully known whether skin penetration of nanoparticles would result in adverse effects in animal models, although topical application of raw SWCNT to nude mice has been shown to cause dermal irritation, and in vitro studies using primary or cultured human skin cells have shown that carbon nanotubes can enter cells and cause release of pro- inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and decreased viability. It remains unclear, however, how these findings may be extrapolated to a potential occupational risk. In addition, nanoparticles may enter the body through wounds, with particles migrating into the blood and lymph nodes.  Gastrointestinal  Ingestion can occur from unintentional hand-to-mouth transfer of materials; this has been found to happen with traditional materials, and it is scientifically reasonable to assume that it also could happen during handling of nanomaterials. Ingestion may also accompany inhalation exposure because particles that are cleared from the respiratory tract via the mucociliary escalator may be swallowed. = Fire and explosion = The explosion pentagon is a representation of the five requirements for a dust explosion. There is concern that engineered carbon nanoparticles, when manufactured on an industrial scale, could pose a dust explosion hazard, especially for processes such as mixing, grinding, drilling, sanding, and cleaning. Knowledge remains limited about the potential explosivity of materials when subdivided down to the nanoscale. The explosion characteristics of nanoparticles are highly dependent on the manufacturer and the humidity. For microscale particles, as particle size decreases and the specific surface area increases, the explosion severity increases. However, for dusts of organic materials such as coal, flour, methylcellulose, and polyethylene, severity ceases to increase as the particle size is reduced below ∼50 μm. This is because decreasing particle size primarily increases the volatilization rate, which becomes rapid enough that that gas phase combustion becomes the rate limiting step, and further decrease in particle size will not increase the overall combustion rate. While the minimum explosion concentration does not vary significantly with nanoparticle size, the minimum ignition energy and temperature have been found to decrease with particle size. Metal-based nanoparticles exhibit more severe explosions than do carbon nanomaterials, and their chemical reaction pathway is qualitatively different. Studies on aluminum nanoparticles and titanium nanoparticles indicate that they are explosion hazards. One study found that the likelihood of an explosion but not its severity increases significantly for nanoscale metal particles, and they can spontaneously ignite under certain conditions during laboratory testing and handling. High-resistivity powders can accumulate electric charge causing a spark hazard, and low-resistivity powders can build up in electronics causing a short circuit hazard, both of which can provide an ignition source. In general, powders of nanomaterials have higher resistivity than the equivalent micron-scale powders, and humidity decreases their resistivity. One study found powders of metal-based nanoparticles to be mid- to high- resistivity depending on humidity, while carbon-based nanoparticles were found to be low-resistivity regardless of humidity. Powders of nanomaterials are unlikely to present an unusual fire hazard as compared to their cardboard or plastic packaging, as they are usually produced in small quantities, with the exception of carbon black. However, the catalytic properties of nanoparticles and nanostructured porous materials may cause untended catalytic reactions that, based on their chemical composition, would not otherwise be anticipated. = Radioactivity = Engineered radioactive nanoparticles have applications in medical diagnostics, medical imaging, toxicokinetics, and environmental health, and are being investigated for applications in nuclear medicine. Radioactive nanoparticles present special challenges in operational health physics and internal dosimetry that are not present for vapors or larger particles, as the nanoparticles' toxicokinetics depend on their physical and chemical properties including size, shape, and surface chemistry. In some cases, the inherent physicochemical toxicity of the nanoparticle itself may lead to lower exposure limits than those associated with the radioactivity alone, which is not the case with most radioactive materials. In general, however, most elements of a standard radiation protection program are applicable to radioactive nanomaterials, and many hazard controls for nanomaterials will be effective with the radioactive versions.  Hazard controls  alt=An inverted triangle consisting of five colored horizontal levels, each containing one tee five hazard control methods: elimination, substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipmentControlling exposures to hazards is the fundamental method of protecting workers. The hierarchy of hazard control is a framework that encompasses a succession of control methods to reduce the risk of illness or injury. In decreasing order of effectiveness, these are elimination of the hazard, substitution with another material or process that is a lesser hazard, engineering controls that isolate workers from the hazard, administrative controls that change workers' behavior to limit the quantity or duration of exposure, and personal protective equipment worn on the workers' body. Prevention through design is the concept of applying control methods to minimize hazards early in the design process, with an emphasis on optimizing employee health and safety throughout the life cycle of materials and processes. It increases the cost-effectiveness of occupational safety and health because hazard control methods are integrated early into the process, rather than needing to disrupt existing procedures to include them later. In this context, adopting hazard controls earlier in the design process and higher on the hierarchy of controls leads to faster time to market, improved operational efficiency, and higher product quality. = Elimination and substitution = An aerosol droplet containing nanomaterials ejected from a vial during sonication. Eliminating or limiting sonication and other handling processes reduces inhalation hazards. Elimination and substitution are the most desirable approaches to hazard control, and are most effective early in the design process. Nanomaterials themselves often cannot be eliminated or substituted with conventional materials because their unique properties are necessary to the desired product or process. However, it may be possible to choose properties of the nanoparticle such as size, shape, functionalization, surface charge, solubility, agglomeration, and aggregation state to improve their toxicological properties while retaining the desired functionality. Other materials used incidentally in the process, such as solvents, are also amenable to substitution. In addition to the materials themselves, procedures used to handle them can be improved. For example, using a nanomaterial slurry or suspension in a liquid solvent instead of a dry powder will reduce dust exposure. Reducing or eliminating steps that involve transfer of powder or opening packages containing nanomaterials also reduces aerosolization and thus the potential hazard to the worker. Reducing agitation procedures such as sonication, and reducing the temperature of reactors to minimize release of nanomaterials in exhaust, also reduce hazards to workers. = Engineering controls = A fume hood is an engineering control using local exhaust ventilation combined with an enclosure. A sticky mat in a nanomaterials production facility. Ideally, other engineering controls should lessen the amount of dust collecting on the floor and being tracked onto the sticky mat, unlike this example. Engineering controls are physical changes to the workplace that isolate workers from hazards by containing them in an enclosure, or removing contaminated air from the workplace through ventilation and filtering. They are used when hazardous substances and processes cannot be eliminated or replaced with less hazardous substitutes. Well-designed engineering controls are typically passive, in the sense of being independent of worker interactions, which reduces the potential for worker behavior to impact exposure levels. The initial cost of engineering controls can be higher than administrative controls or personal protective equipment, but the long- term operating costs are frequently lower and can sometimes provide cost savings in other areas of the process. The type of engineering control optimal for each situation is influenced by the quantity and dustiness of the material as well as the duration of the task. Ventilation systems can be local or general. General exhaust ventilation operates on an entire room through a building's HVAC system. It is inefficient and costly as compared to local exhaust ventilation, and is not suitable by itself for controlling exposure, although it can provide negative room pressure to prevent contaminants from exiting the room. Local exhaust ventilation operates at or near the source of contamination, often in conjunction with an enclosure. Examples of local exhaust systems include fume hoods, gloveboxes, biosafety cabinets, and vented balance enclosures. Exhaust hoods lacking an enclosure are less preferable, and laminar flow hoods are not recommended because they direct air outwards towards the worker. Several control verification techniques can be used with ventilation systems, including pitot tubes, hot-wire anemometers, smoke generators, tracer-gas leak testing, and standardized testing and certification procedures. Examples of non-ventilation engineering controls include placing equipment that may release nanomaterials in a separate room, and placing walk-off sticky mats at room exits. Antistatic devices can be used when handling nanomaterials to reduce their electrostatic charge, making them less likely to disperse or adhere to clothing. Standard dust control methods such as enclosures for conveyor systems, using a sealed system for bag filling, and water spray application are effective at reducing respirable dust concentrations. = Administrative controls = Administrative controls are changes to workers' behavior to mitigate a hazard. They include training on best practices for safe handling, storage, and disposal of nanomaterials, proper awareness of hazards through labeling and warning signage, and encouraging a general safety culture. Administrative controls can complement engineering controls should they fail, or when they are not feasible or do not reduce exposures to an acceptable level. Some examples of good work practices include cleaning work spaces with wet-wiping methods or a HEPA-filtered vacuum cleaner instead of dry sweeping with a broom, avoiding handling nanomaterials in a free particle state, storing nanomaterials in containers with tightly closed lids. Normal safety procedures such as hand washing, not storing or consuming food in the laboratory, and proper disposal of hazardous waste are also administrative controls. Other examples are limiting the time workers are handling a material or in a hazardous area, and exposure monitoring for the presence of nanomaterials. = Personal protective equipment = A worker weighing carbon nanotubes. The worker is using personal protective equipment including a respirator, but is not using local engineering controls such as a fume hood. Personal protective equipment (PPE) must be worn on the worker's body and is the least desirable option for controlling hazards. It is used when other controls are not effective, have not been evaluated, or while doing maintenance or in emergency situations such as spill response. PPE normally used for typical chemicals are also appropriate for nanomaterials, including wearing long pants, long-sleeve shirts, and closed-toed shoes, and the use of safety gloves, goggles, and impervious laboratory coats. Nitrile gloves are preferred because latex gloves do not provide protection from most chemical solvents and may present an allergy hazard. Face shields are not an acceptable replacement for goggles because they do not protect against unbound dry materials. Woven cotton lab coats are not recommended for nanomaterials, as they can become contaminated with nanomaterials and release them later. Donning and removing PPE in a changing room prevents contamination of outside areas. Respirators are another form of PPE. Respirator filters with a NIOSH air filtration rating of N95 or P100 have been shown to be effective at capturing nanoparticles, although leakage between the respirator seal and the skin may be more significant, especially with half-mask respirators. Surgical masks are not effective against nanomaterials. Smaller nanoparticles of size 4–20 nm are captured more efficiently by filters than larger ones of size 30–100 nm, because Brownian motion results in the smaller particles being more likely to contact a filter fiber. In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires fit testing and medical clearance for use of respirators, and the Environmental Protection Agency requires the use of full face respirators with N100 filters for multi-walled carbon nanotubes not embedded in a solid matrix, if exposure is not otherwise controlled.  Industrial hygiene  = Occupational exposure limits = An occupational exposure limit (OEL) is an upper limit on the acceptable concentration of a hazardous substance in workplace air. As of 2016, quantitative OELs have not been determined for most nanomaterials. The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has determined non- regulatory recommended exposure limits (RELs) of 1.0 μg/m3 for carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers as background-corrected elemental carbon as an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) respirable mass concentration, and 300 μg/m3 for ultrafine titanium dioxide as TWA concentrations for up to 10 hr/day during a 40-hour work week. A properly tested, half-face particulate respirator will provide protection at exposure concentrations 10 times the REL, while an elastomeric full facepiece respirator with P100 filters will provide protection at 50 times the REL. Agencies and organizations from other countries, including the British Standards Institute and the Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in Germany, have established OELs for some nanomaterials, and some companies have supplied OELs for their products. In the absence of OELs, a control banding scheme may be used. Control banding is a qualitative strategy that uses a rubric to place hazards into one of four categories, or \\"bands\\", and each of which has a recommended level of hazard controls. Organizations including GoodNanoGuide, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and Safe Work Australia have developed control banding tools that are specific for nanomaterials. The GoodNanoGuide control banding scheme is based only on exposure duration, whether the material is bound, and the extent of knowledge of the hazards. The LANL scheme assigns points for 15 different hazard parameters and 5 exposure potential factors. Alternatively, the \\"As Low As Reasonably Achievable\\" concept may be used. = Exposure assessment = Equipment used for area sampling of airborne nanomaterials. The instruments shown here include a condensation particle counter, aerosol photometer, and two air sampling pumps for filter-based analysis. Exposure assessment is a set of methods used to monitor contaminant release and exposures to workers. These methods include personal sampling, where samplers are located in the personal breathing zone of the worker, often attached to a shirt collar to be as close to the nose and mouth as possible; and area/background sampling, where they are placed at static locations. Assessment generally use both particle counters, which monitor the real-time quantity of nanomaterials and other background particles; and filter-based samples, which can be used to identify the nanomaterial, usually using electron microscopy and elemental analysis. Not all instruments used to detect aerosols are suitable for monitoring occupational nanomaterial emissions because they may not be able to detect smaller particles, or may be too large or difficult to ship to a workplace. Suitable particle counters can detect a wide range of particle sizes, as nanomaterials may aggregate in the air. It is recommended to simultaneously test adjacent work areas to establish a background concentration, as direct reading instruments cannot distinguish the target nanomaterial from incidental background nanoparticles from motor or pump exhaust or heating vessels. While mass-based metrics are traditionally used to characterize toxicological effects of exposure to air contaminants, as of 2013 it was unclear which metrics are most important with regard to engineered nanomaterials. Animal and cell-culture studies have shown that size and shape are the two major factors in their toxicological effects. Surface area and surface chemistry also appeared to be more important than mass concentration. The NIOSH Nanomaterial Exposure Assessment Technique (NEAT 2.0) is a sampling strategy to determine exposure potential for engineered nanomaterials. It includes filter-based and area samples, as well as a comprehensive assessment of emissions at processes and job tasks to better understand peak emission periods. Evaluation of worker practices, ventilation efficacy, and other engineering exposure control systems and risk management strategies serve to allow for a comprehensive exposure assessment. The NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods includes guidance on electron microscopy of filter samples of carbon nanotubes and nanofibers, and additionally some NIOSH methods developed for other chemicals can be used for off-line analysis of nanomaterials, including their morphology and geometry, elemental carbon content (relevant for carbon-based nanomaterials), and elemental makeup. Efforts to create reference materials are ongoing. = Occupational health surveillance = Occupational health surveillance involves the ongoing systematic collection, analysis, and dissemination of exposure and health data on groups of workers, for the purpose of preventing disease and evaluating the effectiveness of intervention programs. It encompasses both medical surveillance and hazard surveillance. A basic medical surveillance program contains a baseline medical evaluation and periodic follow-up examinations, post-incident evaluations, worker training, and identification of trends or patterns from medical screening data. The related topic of medical screening focuses on the early detection of adverse health effects for individual workers, to provide an opportunity for intervention before disease processes occur. Screening may involve obtaining and reviewing an occupational history, medical examination, and medical testing. As of 2016, there were no specific screening tests or health evaluations to identify health effects in people that are caused solely by exposure to engineered nanomaterials. However, any medical screening recommendations for the bulk material that a nanoparticle is made of still apply, and in 2013 NIOSH concluded that the toxicologic evidence on carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers had advanced enough to make specific recommendations for the medical surveillance and screening of exposed workers. Medical screening and resulting interventions represent secondary prevention and do not replace primary prevention efforts based on direct hazard controls to minimize employee exposures to nanomaterials. = Emergency preparedness = It is recommended that a nanomaterial spill kit be assembled prior to an emergency and include barricade tape, nitrile or other chemically impervious gloves, an elastomeric full-facepiece respirator with P100 or N100 filters (fitted appropriately to the responder), adsorbent materials such as spill mats, disposable wipes, sealable plastic bags, walk-off sticky mats, a spray bottle with deionized water or another appropriate liquid to wet dry powders, and a HEPA-filtered vacuum. It is considered unsafe to use compressed air, dry sweeping, and vacuums without a HEPA filter to clear dust.  Regulation  = United States = The Food and Drug Administration regulates nanomaterials under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act when used as food additives, drugs, or cosmetics. The Consumer Product Safety Commission requires testing and certification of many consumer products for compliance with consumer product safety requirements, and cautionary labeling of hazardous substances under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. The General Duty Clause of the Occupational Safety and Health Act requires all employers to keep their workplace free of serious recognized hazards. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration also has recording and reporting requirements for occupational injuries and illness under for businesses with more than 10 employees, and protection and communication regulations under . Companies producing new products containing nanomaterials must use the Hazard Communication Standard to create safety data sheets containing 16 sections for downstream users such as customers, workers, disposal services, and others. This may require toxicological or other testing, and all data or information provided must be vetted by properly controlled testing The ISO/TR 13329 standard provides guidance specifically on the preparation of safety data sheets for nanomaterials. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health does not issue regulations, but conducts research and makes recommendations to prevent worker injury and illness. State and local governments may have additional regulations. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates nanomaterials under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and has permitted limited manufacture of new chemical nanomaterials through the use of consent orders or Significant New Use Rules (SNURs). In 2011 EPA issued a SNUR on multi-walled carbon nanotubes, codified as . Other statutes falling in the EPA's jurisdiction may apply, such as Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (if bacterial claims are being made), Clean Air Act, or Clean Water Act. EPA regulates nanomaterials under the same provisions as other hazardous chemical substances. = Other countries = In the European Union, nanomaterials classified by the European Commission as hazardous chemical substances are regulated under the European Chemical Agency's Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation, as well as the Classification, Labeling, and Packaging (CLP) regulations. Under the REACH regulation, companies have the responsibility of collecting information on the properties and uses of substances that they manufacture or import at or above quantities of 1 ton per year, including nanomaterials. There are special provisions for cosmetics that contain nanomaterials, and for biocidal materials under the Biocidal Products Regulation (BPR) when at least 50% of their primary particles are nanoparticles. In the United Kingdom, powders of nanomaterials may fall under the Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2002, as well as the Dangerous Substances and Explosive Atmosphere Regulations 2002 if they are capable of fueling a dust explosion.

III, p. 735 (\\"Ostorius Scapula\\").PIR, vol. II, p. 440. Praenomina The main praenomina of the Ostorii were Quintus, Publius, Marcus, Gaius, and Lucius, which were the five most common names throughout Roman history. Only the first three are known from the family of the Ostorii Scapulae. The only other praenomen found among the Ostorii is Spurius, which had been a common name in the early Republic, but which fell out of use in imperial times. Branches and cognomina The cognomina of the Ostorii occurring in ancient historians were Sabinus and Scapula. Sabinus refers to a Sabine, and typically indicates that the bearer was of Sabine ancestry. Scapula, literally \\"shoulder-blade\\", was probably given to someone with prominent shoulders.Chase, pp. 110, 114.

Text The book opens with God and the Seven Angels instructing and prophesying the bishops of Seven churches of Asia to conquer and spread the word of the Holy Spirit. These episodes are followed by incidents from John's life and travels, especially his exile on the island of Patmos.\\"The Cloisters Apocalypse\\".

Folio 9 verso contains six armorial shields on the border of an altar cloth. In keeping with a Book of Revelations, contain scenes of pessimism and violence, while miniatures show a bleeding Christ by a tree. The marginalia contains grotesque beasts and daemons.Deuchler (1974), 13 These depictions include fragments of altar tables and doves, with the Souls of the Dead, martyrs, and crucifixion trees. Overall the book takes a soft approach to John's revelations, with the illuminations mainly in the soft style, and courtly, typically Gothic, scenes of domesticity interspersing with darker figures, but all painted in a manner influenced with Spanish art of the period. The later miniatures mostly emphasise John's proximity and bond with Jesus. =Four Horsemen= A number of miniatures detail the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, individually and in groups. The knightly saints are identified through the colour mainly associated with them; St. George rides a white horse (associated with a royal steed), St. Theodore, holding the scales of famine, sits on a \\"gloomy\\" black horse, and St. Demetrius a red horse, (associated with the color of blood). The fourth horseman Death, rides a pale horse, traditionally \\"the color of decay\\", according to art historian Helmut Nickel.Nickel (1977), 179 File:Cloisters Apocalypse (Four Horsemen.).jpgFour Horsemen of the Apocalypse File:Cloisters Apocalypse (Third Horseman).jpgThird Horseman, St. Theodore File:Cloisters Apocalypse (Four Horsemen Death).jpgFourth Horseman, Death Provenance A coat of arms illustrated on one of the leaves suggests it was commissioned by a member of the de Montigny family of Coutances, Normandy.Lawson, 59 Stylistically it resembles other Norman illuminated books, as well as some designs on stained glass, of the period.Deuchler (1974), 14-15 The book was in Switzerland by 1368, possibly at the abbey of Zofingen, in the canton of Aargau.

The name is now better known as the cultural organisation dedicated to artistic development of young people, now known simply as Carclew, which has been housed in the building since 1971 (and then named the South Australian Performing Arts Centre for Young People, and with several name changes since). History The site was originally sold in the first Adelaide land sale of 1837, purchased by George Curtis for 12 shillings. In 1861 the site contained a simple two-storey brick dwelling, a wall surrounding the house and a stable. It was purchased by a stockbroker James Chambers in 1861, who in the same year sponsored the expedition of John McDouall Stuart, which was launched from the site. A plaque on the property's surrounding wall commemorates the event.Explorations in Australia The Journals of John McDouall Stuart During the Years 1858, 1859, 1860, 1861, and 1862, When He Fixed the Centre of the Continent and Successfully Crossed It from Sea to Sea The expedition was the first successful European crossing of the continent, but James Chambers died at the property before Stuart's return.James Chambers, Australian Dictionary of Biography In 1862 the site was purchased by businessman, politician and philanthropist Hugh Robert Dixon (later Sir Hugh Robert Denison), who demolished the existing home, leaving only the wall surrounding the property and the stable. Dixon erected the current grander building in 1897 (or 1901?) and called it \\"Stalheim\\" (perhaps after the town in Norway). In 1908, the building was sold to Sir John Langdon Bonython, editor of The Advertiser and member of the first Parliament of Australia. Bonython renamed the building \\"Carclew\\" after the area in Cornwall where his ancestors had lived. The property remained in the Bonython family until 1965, when it was purchased by the Adelaide City Council. After a 2006 architects' report recommending maintenance work on the structure of the building, the Government of South Australia undertook the construction work, which was completed in October 2009. =Architecture= The house was designed by John Quintin Bruce, a prominent Adelaide architect, who also designed Electra House in King William Street and the Freemasons Hall on North Terrace. The building is an architecturally significant Federation-style mansion, and stands in a prominent position next to Light's Vision. The two-storey building is constructed of sandstone, rusticated brick quoins and has cement decoration, with timber balconies and verandahs, and an iron roof, except for that of the three-storey tower, which is made of slate. There is ornate woodwork on the gables. The decorated archway at the main entrance leads to an entrance hall. From there, the main staircase leads upstairs to what were once the family quarters. The ground floor included a ballroom, morning room, parlour, kitchen scullery, and conservatory. There was a room for the servants with a separate entrance. The single-storey library was added in 1908. Youth arts centre In 1971 Premier Don Dunstan created the South Australian Performing Arts Centre for Young People, which was incorporated in 1972. In 1976 it was renamed the Carclew Youth Arts Centre. Its mandate was changed in 1982 to focus on performing arts, and the name was changed to the Carclew Youth Performing Arts Centre. From late 1988, the mandate was widened to include a broader range of the arts, and to include people up to 26 years old and the name changed back to Carclew Youth Arts Centre to reflect this in March 1991. In 2009 the name again changed, this time to Carclew Youth Arts, and finally to Carclew in 2013. Carclew is unique in South Australia as a multi-art-form centre for young people. It runs programs, workshops, projects and funding opportunities, including scholarships, project grants and mentoring opportunities. It also provides connections with schools and other arts organisations. In February 2019, a new program by Creative Consultants was launched through Carclew, to help young artists to earn a stable income over the course of their careers. Also in 2019, the City of Adelaide is collaborating with Carclew to deliver the \\"Emerging Curator Program\\", a six- month engagement in which three aspiring curators are supported in their professional development. =Governance= The Centre was managed by the Youth Performing Arts Council from 1980, which was established specifically to manage Carclew. After a need for an organisation with a broader focus to manage youth arts policy and programs, the South Australian Youth Arts Board was created and took over in November 1988, at which time the Centre's focus was also expanded. Reporting to the Minister for the Arts, Carclew's funding was the responsibility of Arts South Australia until 2018, when the position of Arts Minister was abolished and it was moved, along with the History of South Australia, Patch Theatre Company and Windmill Theatre Company, to the Department of Education. In July 2019, the state budget slashed funding to the History Trust, Carclew and Windmill, as part of \\"operational efficiency\\" cuts.

General John Floyd, with 900 to 950 militiamen and 450 allied Creek, attacked and burned down both villages, killing 200 Red Sticks in the process. Background The recent Fort Mims massacre had done nothing but validate Floyd's intentions to prepare for a larger offensive. He had raised a substantial company of militia in Georgia, and had made his way into the Mississippi Territory (in what is today central Alabama) in response to increased tensions between white settlers and Creek factions. As Andrew Jackson, John Coffee and John Cocke made their way south from Tennessee with a force of 3,500 men, Floyd set out along the Federal Road for Autossee, a village of about 1,500 Creek (which included High Head Jim and others responsible for the massacre at Fort Mims). His company included 900 militiamen and 450 allied Creek, many from Tukabatchee, under the command of William McIntosh. The battle Before sunrise, the Georgia militia split into two columns in an effort to surround the town. Three things, however, did not go as planned before the attack could commence. First, Floyd discovered a second, smaller Red Stick town, Tallasee (\\"Apple Grove\\"), forcing him to order the company to spread out thinner than he wanted. Also, a western escape route had not been blocked by McIntosh because he and his men could not cross the freezing, deep Tallapoosa River. They had settled for crossing Calebee Creek and blocking the north. Lastly, and most critically, a Red Stick hunter spotted and warned the town, allowing them time to evacuate women and children and to call for nearby help (which did not come). Floyd's men had superior musketry and cannon, which allowed them to storm the village and set it ablaze. Although most enemy Creek warriors fled, Floyd later reported that some stayed to fight to the end, dying in the fires. Aftermath In three hours, 200 to 250 Red Sticks were killed (among whom were the Autossee and Tallasee kings). Most of the townspeople had escaped, however, due to the militia's thinly spread formation and ill-placed allied Creek. Floyd lost 11 of his men by comparison (and a small number of allied Creek), with five wounded including himself.Note: He had been hit by a musket ball in the knee in the midst of battle. Between the two towns, 400 houses were burned to the ground. Now low on supplies, the militia headed back to Fort Mitchell and regrouped for another offensive which would result in the Battle of Calebee Creek. Paddy Walsh, late to help his comrades at Autossee, harassed them along the way, killing an additional five men. Legacy The site of Autossee now lies on private property in Macon County, Alabama, near the town of Shorter. The location is unmarked and inaccessible to the public.

The system has 5 main trunk routes with dedicated bus lanes along with a number of feeder routes that run for a portion of the corridor and serves other areas. History Construction of the first segment started in 2008 and free trial operations started on May 22, 2009. The system officially started operation on May 28, 2009 with a 30 km loop line (B1) with 38 stations. Average ridership of the system in 2014 was 700,000 passengers. It is believed that the daily ridership was approximately 1 million passengers after the opening of the first segment of the 23.7 km long 3rd Ring Road loop line (B3) on June 26, 2014. The route B3 interlined with 15 feeder routes. A new east-west BRT corridor under the Longhai Elevated Road opened on January 26, 2017. This corridor is served by route B5. With the imminent opening of Zhengzhou Metro Line 5 The B1 Loop corridor is being shifted from to avoid duplication. The Zhengzhou government is proposing to introduce trolleybus lines to the B2 Nongye Road BRT corridor, reintroducing trolleybus operation to Zhengzhou which stopped operation in 2010. In 2019, overhead trolleybus lines were installed along the B2 Corridor.  Routes  Main trunk routes with dedicated bus lanes: * B1: Zhongzhou Avenue & Nongye Road — Dianchang Road bus terminal (Route altered after Zhengzhou Metro Line 5 began operation in May 2019) * B2: Daxie bus terminal — Zhongzhou Avenue & Nongye Road * B3: Loop Line, runs on North, West and South 3rd Ring Road and Zhongzhou Avenue (South 3rd Ring Road & Daxue Road is the terminal station) * B5: West 3rd Ring Road & Longhai Road — Zhengzhou East Railway Station, runs mostly under the Longhai Elevated Road * B6: Loop Line: runs on North 3rd Ring Road, Zhongzhou Avenue, Weilai Road, Changjiang Road, Qinling Road and Dianchang Road (Dianchang Road bus terminal is the terminal station) There are also dozens of feeder routes connecting the main routes with other areas of the city.

Early life In a letter to the nine-year-old Angelica Hamilton, who was then staying with her grandparents in Albany, Alexander Hamilton wrote: Angelica was described as a sensitive, lively and musical girl in her youth. She was said to resemble, in beauty, her maternal aunt Angelica Schuyler Church, for whom she was named. During her father's time as Secretary of the Treasury, Martha Washington would take Angelica with her to dance lessons along with her own children. In addition to French and dance lessons, Angelica played a piano that was bought for her by her aunt Angelica Church, which was sent from London to New York through a friend of her father. Alexander Hamilton, according to a grandson, had a \\"rich voice\\" and enjoyed singing popular songs of the day, and \\"Angelica often accompanied him upon the piano or harp, and appears to have been given all the advantages of a musical education.\\" Mental illness Philip Hamilton, whose death in a duel in 1801 was believed to have precipitated Angelica's mental breakdown In November 1801, when Angelica was 17 years old, her oldest brother Philip Hamilton died of injuries resulting from a duel with George Eacker. The news of Philip's death precipitated a mental breakdown that left Angelica in a state described as \\"eternal childhood\\", and often unable even to recognize family members. Angelica's nephew, psychiatrist Allan McLane Hamilton , described his aunt as an \\"invalid\\" and her condition as a type of \\"insanity\\". Dr. Hamilton wrote, \\"Upon receipt of the news of her brother's death in the Eacker duel, she suffered so great a shock that her mind became permanently impaired, and although taken care of by her devoted mother for a long time there was no amelioration in her condition.\\" Though the details of what occurred are not clear from a modern medical perspective, historian Ron Chernow similarly attributed the sudden and extreme deterioration of Angelica's mental health to her reaction to the death of Philip, with whom she had been very close. Other modern authors have described the mental health problem, which lasted for the rest of Angelica's life, without discussion of causation. Despite her parents' best efforts to reach her, Angelica's condition only seemed to worsen. Her father had written his friend Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and asked him to send Angelica watermelons and three parakeets, as she was \\"very fond of birds\\". After visiting the Hamilton home, James Kent tactfully described Angelica as having \\"a very uncommon simplicity and modesty of deportment\\". Adulthood and later life Years after Alexander Hamilton's death, Angelica's aging mother could no longer care for her. Angelica was eventually placed in the care of a Dr. MacDonald of Flushing, Queens, where she remained for the rest of her life. Of this period, her nephew wrote: > During her latter life she constantly referred to the dear brother so nearly > her own age as if alive. Her music, that her father used to oversee and > encourage, stayed by her all these years. To the end she played the same > old-fashioned songs and minuets upon the venerable piano that had been > bought for her, many years before. In 1848, Angelica's sister Eliza Hamilton Holly moved their 91-year-old mother Elizabeth from New York to Washington, D.C., where she died in 1854 at age 97. Elizabeth Hamilton requested in her will that her other children be \\"kind, affectionate, and attentive\\" to her \\"unfortunate daughter Angelica.\\" Eliza Holly, in a letter to an aunt anticipating Angelica's death, remarked that their mother had not wished to outlive Angelica, and wrote, \\"Poor sister, what a happy release will be hers! Lost to herself half a century.\\" Three years after her mother's death, in February 1857, Angelica died in New York at age 72. She was buried in Westchester County, New York at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, where her sister Eliza was buried two years later; in 1878, their brother James Alexander Hamilton was also buried there.  In popular culture  In the 2015 musical Hamilton, Hamilton's daughter Angelica is mentioned, although not by name, in the songs \\"Take a Break\\" and \\"We Know\\". The events of both songs take place prior to the birth of Hamilton's second daughter, Eliza, in 1799.

History Paralakhemedi Light Railway was established by Gajpati Rajas of Paralakhemundi, the erstwhile Rajas of Paralakhemedi. The Raja of Paralakhemedi decided to connect his capital with Naupada, which was only 40 km away. With the then British Government giving sanction in 1898, work began in full earnest. The line was opened to traffic in 1900. This railway line was built at a cost of Rs 7 lakh. The operations of the PLR was taken over by the Bengal-Nagpur Railway (BNR) in 1902. In the first few years, the PLR had incurred losses but after 1910, it started making marginal profits and after 1924-25, the profits increased. This motivated the Raja to extend the line to Gunupur in two phases in 1929 and 1931. The standard type of locomotive on PLR was the 20 ton 0-6-4 tank locomotive with small (27 inch diameter) coupled wheels and an axle load of only 4.75 tons. During the SER centenary celebrations in 1987, set of four postage stamps were released. One of the stamps featured the PL 691 locomotive. Conversion to broad gauge The line was finally closed for gauge conversion on 9 June 2004. After conversion to broad gauge the Gunpur-Paralakhemundi-Naupada rail line was opened to public and from 21 August 2011.

He is known from the chronicle of Sampiro, written in the first third of the eleventh century, which presents him as a rebellious subject of the Kingdom of Asturias, strongly suggesting that he was not appointed count by the king but was instead the leader of a rebellion. After King Alfonso III marched an army into Álava, the people submitted and Eylo was taken into captivity and brought back to Alfonso's capital of Oviedo. Sampiro presents the story of Eylo immediately after his account of the usurpation of Fruela, which took place in 866–67 and which forced Alfonso III to take refuge in Álava. In these years, there were also major attacks on Álava from the Emirate of Córdoba to the south. The Emir Muhammad I launched a major raid ending in a pitched battle in 866 and his son al-Hakam invaded the region again the next year. It is unlikely, therefore, that Eylo's rebellion took place before 868. The Chronicle of Albelda, written around 881 in neighbouring Navarre, refers to \\"much time having passed\\" in 873 since the rebellion, although it does not mention Eylo by name. Sampiro's chronicle is preserved in two twelfth-century copies: that made by Pelagius of Oviedo for his Chronicon regum Legionensium and that made for the Historia silense. They differ in the spelling of the count's name. The copy of Pelagius uses Eylo (accusative Eylonem) and the Silense uses Gilo (Gilonem). It is possible that the obscure Eylo is the same person as the next known count of Álava, Vela Jiménez, active in 882–83. The name Vela (or Beila) appears in Latin documents in various declensions as Vigila, Vigilonis and Vigilonem. If the spelling Gilonem is the more authentic for the earlier count (and Eylonem a corruption), it may represent a shortened form of Vigilonem (Vela). If they are the same person, then Alfonso III must at some point have released his prisoner and put him back in power. Primary source This is Pelagius' version of Sampiro's account: :A messenger from Álava arrived, announcing that their hearts had been inflamed against the king; hearing this the monarch disposed to march towards [Álava]. Impelled by the fear that his arrival produced, they quickly recognised their obligations and lowered their heads in supplication before him and promised him that they would remain faithful to his kingship and his authority, and that they would do whatever he ordered them. In this way he subjugated to his own power an Álava [that was] stretched out before him. Eylo, who was presented as their count, he took to Oviedo in irons. :Ipso vero istis satagente operibus, nuntius ex Alavis venit, eo quod intumuerant corda illorum contra regem. Rex vero haec audiens, illuc ire disposuit; terrore adventus ejus compulsi sunt, et subito jura debita cognoscentes, supplices colla ei submiserunt, pollicentes se regno et ditioni ejus fideles existere, et quod imperaretur efficere; sicque Alavam obtentam proprio imperio subjugavit.

She died in 2007 as a result of brain cancer. Shipra Guha Mukharji the woman scientist who was behind the breakthrough discovery of \\"The technique of production of haploid plants through anther culture.\\"  Early life and education  Shipra Guha-Mukherjee was born in Kolkata on 13 July 1938. She did her schooling in Bombay and Delhi and joined Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi for her BSc Botany (Hons) in 1954. She remained in Jawaharlal Nehru University, first as student and then as professor and researcher, for more than 30 years. She completed her MSc from there as well. She then went on to do her PhD under Prof. B. M. Johri on the tissue culture of an onion and completed her PhD at 1963 (Allium cepa). She is quoted as saying: > \\"I decided to study botany because it was my favorite subject in school. As > a school student I was awed by the contribution of Sir Jagadish Chandra > Bose, and fascinated by his work that showed that plants were living > organisms and had a metabolism similar to that of animals. His hypothesis > that ascent of sap in plants is due to pulsatory activity of an inner layer > of cortical cells (a theory no longer tenable) infused a huge excitement in > me, as earlier I used to think that plants were inert objects which could > never respond to any external stimuli. As a student in classes five and six, > I developed a strong determination to find the locations of the “heart” and > “brain” of plants and to understand the way they functioned.\\"  Research and career  She was professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi. Her field of specialization was plant tissue culture, plant molecular biology, biotechnology and cell biology. After her PhD, Guha-Mukherjee joined the lab of S. C. Maheshwari as a postdoctoral fellow, where she did her most significant work. Between 1964 and 1966, she discovered the technique of production of haploid pollen plants through anther culture using Datura innoxia as the culture material, which has been published in the journal In Vitro Cellular & Developmental Biology. This work led to the establishment of techniques of culture of young ovules and ovaries. This technique has also been used as an additional tool for obtaining improved varieties of rice, wheat, potato and other crops. She has also worked on regeneration of plants and mechanism of regeneration involving various enzymes, membrane phospholipids and second messengers during her time at the School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi. Guha-Mukherjee then went to the US in late 1966 and worked with R. S. Bandurski at the Department of Botany and Plant Pathology as a research associate at Michigan State University. Between 1970 and 1972 she served as an assistant professor in the Biology Department at West Virginia University and later at the well-known MSU/DOE Plant Research Laboratory when Anton Lang and Joe Varner were there. After her return to India, Shipra Guha-Mukherjee collaborated with M. S. Swaminathan for raising haploids in rice. Then she returned to Jawaharlal Nehru University to join the new Life Science Faculty as one of its founding internet. She was promoted to full professor in 1979 and served as the dean of life sciences between 1993 and 1995. She also served as member of the task force and scientific advisory committee, Department of Biotechnology, Government of India, and also on the board of the University Grants Commission. Shipra Guha- Mukherjee was an expert in plant tissue culture, haploids and plant biotechnology.  Awards and recognition  Shipra Guha-Mukherjee has received the Senior National Bio-scientist Award, the Om Prakash Bhasin Foundation Award in Biotechnology and the Kanishka Award from the Lion's Club. She was elected a Fellow of the Indian Academy of Science, Bangalore and also at the National Academy of Science, Allahabad.

Many species, including Bracon brevicornis, have been used in biocontrol programs.  Description and distribution  Braconines are small to medium sized wasps. Many are dark in color, but they can be red, orange, or pale. They have cyclostome mouthparts and females usually have a long ovipositor. They are found worldwide, but are most diverse in the Paleotropical region.  Biology  Braconines are idiobiont ectoparasitoids of concealed larvae. The hosts of most species are Lepidoptera or Coleoptera, with a few attacking Diptera or Symphyta. Usually, they paralyze the host with venom before laying one or more (depending on the species) large eggs on the host's exterior.

Bullets are then deflected clockwise around the deceleration chamber until they lose kinetic energy and fall out the bottom of the deceleration chamber. A bullet trap (or pellet trap when used specifically for air guns) is a device to stop and collect projectiles fired at a shooting range to prevent overpenetrations and stray shots. Bullet traps typically use friction, impact or gradual deceleration to stop bullets. The bullet trap may also provide means to recycle bullet materials and/or prevent release of toxic heavy metals (such as lead dust from fragmented bullets) from the shooting range. Some bullet traps include a negative- pressure system to filter dust from air within the impact zone and/or capture area.  Deceleration traps  Deceleration-type bullet traps direct bullets into a helical or circular chamber in which the bullet will slide against the curved chamber wall until it gradually loses velocity from friction and drops to the bottom of the chamber, where it can be later collected. For use with multiple firing positions, the helical chamber often resembles a horizontal pipe, into which bullets are directed by upper and lower steel plates. The upper plate slopes downward and the lower plate slopes upward to a horizontal slot in the side of the helical chamber. Alternatively, some narrow deceleration traps for single firing positions employ vertical plates to direct bullets into a helical deceleration chamber resembling a vertical pipe from which spent bullets drop out the lower end. Lightweight versions suitable for capturing airgun pellets are often used behind electronic scoring systems on ranges configured for ISSF 10 metre airgun events. The plate slopes are shallow (about 18° ) so bullets may be deflected relatively intact rather than disintegrated upon impact. Some deceleration traps use an oil and/or water coating to reduce friction and capture dust.  Impact traps  Impact bullet trap into sand. Impact-type bullet traps typically use vertical or angled 500 Brinell scale steel plate at least thick for centrefire cartridges. Plate thickness of may be adequate for rimfire ammunition. Sloping plates deflect bullets downward into sand, water or some other capture material; but the plate angle is often steep enough to largely disintegrate the bullet upon initial impact, and bullets are expected to disintegrate upon impacting vertical plates to prevent dangerous backward ricochets. Shooter protection for firing positions within of the impact plate may require an anti-splash curtain of Linatex® or similar self-healing material hung in front of the plate to contain any fragments of “back splash” as well as dust. Rifle bullets may be partially melted by the energy of bullet impact. The spray of molten metal may solidify as dust, and soft lead bullets often leave a smear of lead upon impacting the steel plate. Smeared metal may be converted to additional airborne dust by subsequent bullet impact. The popularity of vertical plate installations for indoor ranges is largely down to their minimal footprint compared with sand, granular or helical bullet traps and can consume less than of a room’s available length—comprising the thickness of the steel plate, the thickness of the anti-splash curtain and 10 to 11 inches of air gap between. However, sloping steel plates will tend to wear less quickly—particularly on precision target ranges where fixed targets result in fire being concentrated into small areas. In such cases, small sloping plates or sacrificial vertical wear plates may be placed behind the targets as the primary bullet trap, whilst a large vertical plate covers the remainder of the wall as the defence zone to catch errant shots. The small plates can be easily changed as frequently as necessary whilst the main back wall will need little maintenance from occasional scattered fire.  Friction traps  Earthen berm friction bullet trap Friction bullet traps slow and capture the bullet more gently than steel plates. This allows more effective capture of contaminants and reduces the production of dust as well as allowing for the capture of higher energy projectiles which would wear an impact trap too quickly and necessitate uneconomical levels of maintenance. The most common form of friction trap is a berm of granular material such as sand; earth or granulated rubber. In some circumstances a wall of railway ties, intact vehicle tires or blocks of shock- attenuating concrete (SACON) or other proprietary materials may be used. SACON is a fiber-reinforced concrete substituting expanded polystyrene beads for gravel aggregate. For ISSF 50 metre rifle events, individual bullet traps comprising a metal box filled with plastic beads are often used behind the electronic scoring systems used for such events. Such systems require less space than earthen berms whilst being quieter than steel impact or deceleration traps, which can be a significant consideration for urban outdoor range complexes. Individual bullet traps of this nature would typically be backed by a concrete wall to protect from negligent discharges or mechanical failures causing a bullet to miss the target entirely but which is not expected to be struck during the course of normal firing. Intact vehicle tyres are generally only suitable for higher energy projectiles which will easily penetrate their surface. Handgun bullets and shotgun pellets may ricochet back. Granulated rubber (often from shredded tires) is a convenient capture material from which bullets may be separated by gravity during agitation by subsequent bullet impact.

They have produced work for 20th Century Fox, Walt Disney Television Animation and Cartoon Network.  History  In 2002, Grasshorse began as a sole proprietorship with Jennings working on shows including Craig McCracken’s The Powerpuff Girls for Cartoon Network, Warner Bros.' Johnny Test, Genndy Tartakovsky’s Star Wars: Clone Wars and Megas XLR. Jennings pioneered 2D 3D hybrid animation techniques on The Powerpuff Girls; he was one of the first to mash the aesthetics of 2D animation with 3D animation in broadcast television. In 2007, the studio was relocated to Iowa by siblings Kathy Buxton and Steve Jennings and expanded with the goal of competing with international studios in quality and budget. Soon after, Grasshorse partnered with Southeastern Community College (Iowa) in creating a Character animation program. After three years in the writing and planning of the curriculum its first classes began in Fall, 2011. Jennings and Buxton continue to serve on the board of SCC's animation program.

Unlike other similar orchids, E. pusilla never develops lengthwise folded leaves (conduplicate leaves) or extra storage organs (pseudobulbs). The blooming season is from fall to spring. It produces solitary light-yellow orchid-shaped flowers. In comparison to the overall plant size, these flowers can reach a relatively large size (1 to 2.5 cm). The lateral sepals are united near the flower base. Compared to other orchids, E. pusilla has a short life cycle (about 17 months). It can reach adulthood in just one season, while the majority of the orchids reach maturity in up to 5 years. Name It is commonly known as the tiny psygmorchis, due to its miniature size. The current scientific name is Erycina pusilla. The etymology of its scientific name refers to its beauty and tiny size: “Erycina” is a byname of the Roman goddess for beauty, Venus (Venus of Eryx), and “pusilla” is Latin meaning “very little”.

Distribution and habitat  Erycina pusilla can be found in the neotropical region, including South and Central America, the southern Mexican lowlands, the Caribbean islands and southern Florida. Its habitat consists of humid forests at elevations of with temperatures varying from warm to hot. Like many orchids, E. pusilla grows harmlessly upon other plants. It gets moisture and nutrients from the surroundings without affecting the host plant (commensalism). Its quick development permits this orchid to grow on relatively short-lasting sites such as twigs or even leaves of bushes and trees, such as coffee plant or hibiscus. For this reason, it is usually classified as a twig epiphyte.  Use in science  Erycina pusilla is a promising model candidate for Oncidium research. Its relatively tiny size and its short life cycle, facilitates its cultivation. Additionally, it has the ability to complete its life cycle in vitro.\\"IN VITRO FRUITING AND SEED PRODUCTION IN ERYCINA PUSILLA.\\" http://journal- pop.org/References/Vol_11_3(131-136).pdf The functional genomic research is easier because E. pusilla only has 6 chromosomes\\"Chromosome analysis in Psygmorchis pusilla (L.) Dodson & Dressier\\" http://www.caryologia.unifi.it/past_volumes/52_3_4/9.pdf. and a small genome size (1.5 pg 1C nucleus). Another aspect that speaks for the use of this orchid in research, is the rare pollination and production of seeds in nature.http://www.tropecol.com/pdf/open/PDF_48_1/Damon_n_Pedro.pdf This reduces the risk of undesired propagation of transgenic lines. The rapid growth and the low chromosome numbers make E. pusilla is also an excellent parent for traditional hybridization methods. All these characteristics make E. pusilla a promising model not only for research, but also for commercial breeding, since it constitutes an excellent parent for traditional hybridization methods. Beyond the use of this orchid for research and commercial purposes, E. pusilla has also medical applications. The ingestion of whole plant cooked treats colic and stomachache. Additionally, the whole plant boiled is also used as a wash to treat lacerations cuts and wounds. = In vitro cultivation = Sporadic flowering in flasks was first reported by Livingston (1962), although the in vitro cultivation was just established (2007). The primary culture of E. pusilla becomes a callus after about one month of cultivation. Three months later it reaches leaf stage and after eight months the flowering stage begins. After two and half months E. pusilla produces fruits. A new cycle can start from a new primary culture: protocorm- like body (PLB) in vitro. = Genome = The transcriptome sequence of E. pusilla is available (Orchidstra Database). Some basic molecular resources were also established, including the sequencing of the chloroplast genome, the transcriptome and the BAC library. The miRNA database of E. pusilla, including the identification of miRNA biosynthesis-related genes and miRNA families, was established in 2013. The chloroplast genome has been sequenced efficiently and economically by using BAC library and next-generation sequencing. The chloroplast genome of E. pusilla is 143.164 bp in size, which contains a pair of inverted repeats (IRa and IRb) of 23.439 bp separated by large and small single copy regions of 84.189 and 12.097 bp, respectively. From these result compare to Oncidium, the gene order of chloroplast genome between E. pusilla and Oncidium are similar. In Taiwan, different hybridization compatibility of E. pusilla with Oncidium, Rodriguezia and Tolumnia was found by crossing with several important Oncidiinae orchids. = MADS-box genes = Due to their role in plant growth, the characterization of MADS-box genes in E. pusilla has turned into a hot topic for both researchers and commercial orchid breeders. MADS-box genes encode for MADS-domain proteins, which are generally transcription factors. In plants, these proteins control key developmental processes throughout almost all life stages. To date, 28 MADS-box genes were isolated in E. pusilla, namely EpMADS1 to 28. Nearly all of them contain introns greater than 10 kb, which reflects the complexity of the E. pusilla genome. Many EpMADS genes have expression patterns similar to those MADS-box genes in Arabidopsis. The 28 proteins, encoded by the E. pusilla MADS-box genes, are classified as type I or type II based on BLASTP analyses.

Kireyev was drafted into the Imperial Russian Navy in 1911 and served in the Baltic Fleet during World War I as a ship's mechanic. He became a Bolshevik and after the February Revolution led a detachment that helped organize the Ice Cruise of the Baltic Fleet. After falling ill in 1918, Kireyev spent the Russian Civil War on land in various party roles and in the 1920s successively served on the revolutionary military councils of the Black Sea Fleet and the Baltic Fleet. After graduating from the Naval Academy of the Red Army he became commander of the Caspian Flotilla and then assistant Pacific Fleet commander. Kireyev moved up to command the fleet itself after the beginning of the Great Purge in July 1937. He was arrested in January 1938 and executed in late July. Kireyev was posthumously rehabilitated (acquitted) in 1956.  Early life  Kireyev was born on 2 February 1890 in Lyudinovo in Kaluga Governorate to a working-class family. After graduating from the Bezhitsa Vocational School, he worked at the Lyudinovo Locomotive Factory. In 1911, Kireyev was drafted into the Imperial Russian Navy. He was initially assigned to the 1st Baltic Naval Crew.  World War I and Russian Civil War  During World War I he served as a ship's mechanic in the Baltic Fleet, becoming a non-commissioned officer. After the February Revolution Kireyev was elected chairman of the Helsingfors Sailors' Club and a member of the Helsingfors Soviet of Deputies, in which he led the Sailors' section. Simultaneously, Kireyev was commissar of a detachment of sailors guarding Baltic Fleet property in Finland. From February to August, he led the Special Detachment of the Baltic Fleet Council of Commissars, among whose tasks was to organize the Ice Cruise of the Baltic Fleet, its evacuation from Helsingfors to Kronstadt ahead of German invasion forces. During the summer of 1918, Kireyev fell ill and returned to Lyudinovo. Upon his recovery, Kireyev was elected chairman of the Bryansk City Council. He subsequently edited the provincial newspaper and worked in party and government organizations. In Bryansk, he married Anna Ivanovna Ivanyuta. In January 1921, he was elected chairman of the Sevsky Uyezd Executive Committee. In August he became the second secretary of the Bryansk Governorate Party Committee. As a member of Forces of Special Purpose (CHON), responsible for assisting the local Soviet government in maintaining Soviet power, Kireyev participated in the suppression of anti-Soviet uprisings in Bryansk, Sevsk, and Dmitrovsk Uyezds. At the end of 1921, Kireyev was transferred to Siberia to become a member of the Krasnoyarsk Governorate Party Committee.  Interwar  In 1923 he was transferred to political work in the Soviet Navy. In January 1923, Kireyev became a member of the Black Sea Fleet's Revolutionary Military Council. He became a member of the Baltic Fleet's Revolutionary Military Council in January 1926. In 1927 he graduated from the Courses of Improvement for Higher Officers (KUVNAS) at the Naval Academy. Kireyev became part-time head of the Baltic Fleet's Political Directorate in July 1928, and in this position participated in the Soviet Navy's cruise around Europe between November 1929 and 1930, which transferred the battleship Parizhskaya Kommuna and cruiser Profintern from the Baltic Fleet to the Black Sea Fleet. Between 1931 and 1933, Kireyev was a student in the special courses at the Naval Academy. After graduating, he took command of the Caspian Flotilla. In 1933, he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. In October 1933, Kireyev became assistant commander of the Naval Forces in the Far East, which in 1935 became the Soviet Pacific Fleet. In 1935, Kireyev was awarded the Order of Lenin and in the same year he was made a Fleet Flag Officer 1st Rank when the Soviet Armed Forces introduced ranks. In July 1937, he became commander of the Pacific Fleet after Mikhail Viktorov became commander in chief of the Navy.  The Great Purge and Death  As a result of the call to extend the then- ongoing Great Purge to the armed forces, during the fall of 1937, Army Commissar 1st Rank Pyotr Smirnov led a working group to purge the Pacific Fleet of \\"Wreckers\\" and \\"enemies of the people.\\" Smirnov used forced confessions from those previously arrested to implicate more officers and create the appearance of a conspiracy in the fleet. After being summoned to Moscow, Kireyev was arrested on 10 January 1938. He was sentenced to death and executed at the Kommunarka shooting ground on 29 July 1938 on charges of participation in a \\"military conspiracy\\", sabotaging the Pacific Fleet, and spying for Japanese intelligence, along with Viktorov and the rest of the fleet's high-ranking officers.

He founded the Pentecost International Worship Centre, a ministry of The Church of Pentecost in 1993. He holds a doctor of philosophy degree in theological studies from the University of Birmingham (2002) and a master of theology in applied theology from Regents Theological College. He is the last of the Apostles who walked with the founder of The Church of Pentecost, Pastor James McKeown. Onyinah joined the ministry of The Church of Pentecost in 1976 and has served in various positions, including rector of Pentecost University College, an executive council member and the first International Missions Director of the church. He is also an adjunct lecturer at the Pentecost Theological Seminary. Onyinah served as a member of National Peace Council in Ghana, the president of the Ghana Pentecostal and Charismatic Council from 2011 to 2019, chairman of the Ghana Evangelism Committee from 2010 to date, co-chairman of Empowered21 Africa from 2013 to date, advisory board member of International Review of Mission since 2013, member of the Committee of World Pentecostal Theologians in Dialogue with the Catholic Church since 2011, member of a standing committee of Health and Healing of World Council of Churches/DIFAM, 2005–2010, member of the Commission on World Mission and Evangelism of World Council of Churches since 2007, and a member of the editorial board of the Journal of Pentecostal Theology since 2007. Early life and education Opoku Onyinah was born to Opanin Kwame Onyinah and Maame Rebecca Akosua Addai of Aduman about 7:00 am in a local maternity home in the town. As per Akan tradition, he was named after his grand-uncle, a popular chief of Dwumakyi village called Opanin Nimfour. He grew up with the name \\"Koofour\\" an abridged form of Kwadwo Nimfour. 22 July was adopted as his official birthday though his Catholic Baptism Certificate bears 24 July as his birthday. He started his basic education at Yamfo Presbyterian Primary School and completed Middle Form Four at Yamfo Catholic Middle School. He was trained in carpentry and joinery in Sunyani Technical and Tamale Technical Institutes. His calling into pastoral ministry in 1976 enabled him to acquire a master of theology in applied theology in 1998 and Philosophy in Theological Studies from University of Birmingham in 2002. Onyinah's was promoted as an associate professor in 2016. In response this promotion, a citation in honor written by the current general secretary of The Church of Pentecost, Apostle Alexander Nana Yaw Kumi-Larbi states: “It is with great honor and pleasure that we officially announce the promotion of the Chairman of The Church of Pentecost, Apostle Dr. Opoku Onyinah, to the academic rank of an Associate Professor.” – By Aps. Alexander N. Y. A.Kumi-Larbi\\" Employment and full-time ministry Onyinah was employed by the State Construction Company as a regional estimator before his call into the full-time ministry of The Church of Pentecost in 1976. His first ministerial station was a district overseer to Wa District from 1976 to 1981 in the Northern Region. Then transferred to Kumasi as district pastor from 1981 to 1984, He served as Ashanti regional head from 1984 to 1986, he left Ghana to London, UK, for further studies from 1986 to 1988. His return to Ghana saw him appointed as the Koforidua regional head from 1988 to 1991, he became the first international missions director for the church from 1991 to 1996, he continued theological studies at London-UK from 1996 to 2002, he was appointed principal to Pentecost Bible College, which subsequently upgraded to Pentecost University College as its first rector from 2002 to 2008 and finally as chairman of The Church of Pentecost-Worldwide from 2008 to 2018. Chairmanship Onyinah was elected the chairman of The Church of Pentecost in 2008 succeeded Apostle Michael Ntumy through election. He won 2/3 of the vote cast. The chairmanship comes along with critical responsibilities. As a chairman, Apostle Onyinah performs the following functions: * Chairs the executive council and the general council meetings * Ex-officio member of every board and committee of the church * Chairs every meeting, convention or rally he attends * Directs action on issues and correspondence pertaining to missionaries and external branches * Chairman of the Missions Board * Assigns to the general secretary and the international missions director such duties as he deems necessary * Responsible for appointing an acting general secretary or international missions director from among the executive council members, or apostles and prophets during the short absence of the general secretary or the international missions director not exceeding six months * Takes decisions and actions with any area head where disciplinary or other action is urgently required in an area and afterwards reports to the executive council * Organizes retreats, seminars, and prayer sessions for National/Area Heads and Ministers * Issues pastoral and circular letters as and when he deems necessary * Confers with the general secretary and the international missions director on matters concerning government and outside bodies * Gives a formal address on the state of the church at every general council meeting He was re- elected in the 40th general council meeting held at the Pentecost Convention Centre at Gomoa Fetteh in the Central Region. He obtained 77.3% of vote cast at the council meeting, which enabled him a five-year leadership mandate. Onyinah also chairs the Ghana Pentecostal and Charismatic Council. He was deputized by Sam Korankye Ankrah. He is a member of the National Peace Council along with Prof. Emmanuel Asante and Bishop James Saah. Challenges He claims to have faced some challenges in his ministry. Significant among them is a review of church culture concerning head covering and wearing of trousers by females in church services. This review was made by the church's college of apostles, prophets and evangelists in January 2010 and subsequently issued a communique to inform church members about the review. The review was not accepted by some of the members and the general public which resulted in strong criticism against his leadership. Gibson Annor-Antwi, the co-author of the autobiography of Onyinah, believes that one of his strengths is the ability to handle difficult issues with absolute cordiality. He wrote that before the review of the said practices, the general secretary of the church, Apostle Dr. Alfred Koduah, was tasked to conduct an in-depth analysis of the issue. In an interview conducted by Gibson Annor-Antwi, Kodua said, \\"When on Tuesday 19 January 2010, I finished and presented the paper, it received a standing ovation\\". Another member of the college, Apostle Peter Ayerakwah, proposed that a communique should be written to all assemblies hence, the 46-page document of F. Koduah was collapsed into two pages for circulation. The communique was rejected by some members of the church, especially some elders from Beposo to Agona Ahanta in the Western Region as published in the Daily Guide Newspaper by Sam Mark Essien, Takoradi on 19 February 2010. Aftermath of this publication, was a strong agitation by members and officers who called the house of Prof. Opoku Onyinah with threats and anger. According to Annor-Antwi, Opoku Onyinah led leadership and in spirit of love and explained the issues which eventually restored peaceful atmosphere in the church.

He was an expert on early keyboard instruments, and assembled an important collection which now forms the Raymond Russell Collection of Early Keyboard Instruments of the University of Edinburgh.  Life  Russell was born in London on 27 May 1922, the son of Gilbert Russell and his wife Maud, née Nelke. His father was from an aristocratic family related to the Dukes of Bedford, his mother a noted patron of the arts. The family was rich; from 1934 they lived at Mottisfont Abbey in Hampshire. In the Second World War Russell initially applied for registration as a conscientious objector, and was formally exempted from combatant service, but changed his mind. He enlisted in the Royal Fusiliers, where he reached the rank of captain. He had already begun collecting keyboard instruments in 1939, before hostilities began. Over the next twenty years he assembled a considerable collection of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century clavichords and harpsichords. His collection included instruments from all the main harpsichord-building areas of Europe: a number of English spinets; early harpsichords and virginals from Italy; Flemish instruments by the Ruckers; a late French instrument by Pascal Taskin; and a clavichord and harpsichord from North Germany, both by Johann Adolph Hass. Russell was an able harpsichordist, and became an expert organologist. He catalogued the keyboard instrument collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the collection of Benton Fletcher, now in Fenton House. In 1959 he published The Harpsichord and Clavichord: an Introductory Study, with accurate and detailed analysis and descriptions of the instruments. Russell was an early advocate of a historicallyinformed approach to instrument-building, based on study of surviving historical examples, and a return to traditional methods of both performance and construction. His book influenced builders such as Frank Hubbard in this direction. Russell was also an expert on, and collector of, early treatises of medicine; towards the end of his life, he researched the antiquities of the island of Malta.  The Russell Collection  By 1960 Russell had decided to donate his collection to Edinburgh University, where it was to become the nucleus of a centre for research in keyboard performance practice and organology, but this plan was not completed by the time of his death. He died in Malta on 17 March 1964. In 1968, in his memory and in accordance with his wishes, his mother donated almost all his collection to the university, which later bought two more of his instruments; the donation also included his notes and his collection of documentary photographs. The twenty-one instruments constitute the Raymond Russell Collection of Early Keyboard Instruments, which is housed in St Cecilia's Hall in Edinburgh.

Craft previously served as the United States ambassador to Canada, being the first woman to hold the office. She was appointed by President George W. Bush as a U.S. alternate delegate to the United Nations in 2007, where her focus included U.S. engagement in Africa. She was a delegate to the 2016 Republican National Convention from Kentucky. She headed Kelly G. Knight LLC, a business advisory firm based in Lexington, Kentucky. She was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in a vote of 56–34, and was officially sworn in as the United Nations ambassador on September 10, 2019. She formally presented her credentials to Secretary- General António Guterres on September 12, 2019. Early life and education Craft was born in 1962 in Lexington, Kentucky, the daughter of the late veterinarian Bobby Guilfoil and Sherry Dale Guilfoil. Her father was a Democratic Party activist who once served as chairman of the Barren County, Kentucky Democratic Party. She grew up in Glasgow, Kentucky, and graduated from Glasgow High School in 1980. She graduated with a B.A. from the University of Kentucky in 1984. Craft served on the board of trustees of her alma mater, the University of Kentucky, for a term beginning August 2016, but resigned to accept the Canadian ambassadorship a year later. Political involvement and donations In 2004, Craft was a prominent supporter of George W. Bush, who appointed her an alternate delegate to the United Nations in 2007. As part of the delegation, her responsibilities included advising the UN ambassador on US/Africa policy. Craft has been described as a generous donor to Republican political candidates. In 2016, Craft and her husband donated millions of dollars to candidates for the 2016 Republican nomination for president. Prior to donating more than $2 million to Donald Trump's campaign, the couple supported Marco Rubio. Craft and her husband, Joe Craft, have strongly supported Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. McConnell in turn urged Trump to nominate Craft as ambassador to Canada. The Crafts have \\"gold\\"-level membership at Trump hotels, which is for customers who have stayed more than 20 times at Trump hotels; according to the Washington Post, such memberships are rare. U.S. ambassador to Canada On June 15, 2017, Craft was nominated by President Donald Trump to become the ambassador to Canada. She was confirmed by the United States Senate by voice vote on August 3 and assumed office on October 23. In her first week as ambassador to Canada, Craft said in an interview with CBC News that when it comes to the scientific consensus on climate change she believes in \\"both sides of the science.\\" According to a June 2019 report in Politico, Craft was frequently absent from her Ottawa post during her tenure as ambassador. During a 15-month period, she took 128 flights between Ottawa and the United States, the equivalent of a round trip per week. 70 of the trips either had Lexington, Kentucky as the origin or destination of her trips, which raised questions as to whether the trips were for personal reasons. The Trump administration did not provide records of how many days Craft was present in Ottawa; per State Department rules, an ambassador may only spend 26 work days away from a post. She spent 300 days (more than half of her term) absent from her post. Craft does not make her schedules available. U.N. ambassador Kelly Craft presents credentials to Antonio Guterres Craft with US secretary of state Mike Pompeo in 2020 On February 22, 2019, Trump announced his intention to nominate Craft to replace Nikki Haley, who had resigned the previous year, to be the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, after his first replacement choice, Heather Nauert, withdrew her nomination. On May 2, 2019, Craft's nomination was formally sent to the United States Senate. On June 19, 2019, a hearing on her nomination was held before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. During the hearing Craft said that she would continue to fight what she alleges as anti-Israel bias in the United Nations. Although Craft had previously said during her tenure as ambassador to Canada that she believed there were \\"good scientists on both sides” of the climate debate, during her confirmation hearing she reversed her position stating that she believed that fossil fuels and human behavior have contributed to climate change. Due to her family's connections to the coal industry she also agreed to recuse herself from any UN discussions involving climate change or coal. On July 25, 2019, her nomination was reported out of committee by a vote of 15–7. On July 30, 2019, the Senate voted 57–33 to invoke cloture on her nomination. On July 31, 2019, her nomination was confirmed by a vote of 56–34. She was formally sworn in by Vice President Mike Pence on September 10, 2019. On August 13, 2020, Craft celebrated the announcement of diplomatic relations between the United Arab Emirates and Israel, calling it “a huge win” for President Trump and for the world, saying that the diplomatic ties show “just how hungry for peace we all are in this world,” and how Mideast countries are all understanding the need “to stand firm against a regime that is the number one state sponsor of terrorism” — Iran.The Latest: US envoy: UAE-Israel deal ‘huge win’ for Trump. 13 August 2020.

It is named after the confiscation or concealment of Tibetan flags that were used as part of the demonstrations. This has led to extensive efforts to determine if, and if so, by whom, these decisions were made.  Chronology  Flag of Tibet On the 15th of June, 2012, Chinese president Hu Jintao visited Copenhagen, eliciting demonstrations against Chinese dominion over Tibet, in which the Tibetan flag was displayed. In that context, several protesters were detained or had their flags confiscated. Years later, in 2015, the existence of an order within the Copenhagen police to \\"shield the Chinese president from protesters\\" was brought into public light. In June 2013, when another high-ranking Chinese politician Yu Zhengsheng visited, protesters once again displayed the Tibetan flag, and were blocked from the view of Yu and his entourage. An official in the Ministry of Justice was persuaded on the 30th of July, 2013 to cease her investigation of the events of the 2013 demonstration on the grounds that it might harm the Minister of Justice Morten Bødskov. The Danish Chairman of the organization Support Committee for Tibet, Anders Højmark said in an article on 20 December 2014, \\"It is disappointing that the government will not meet with the Tibetan Buddhist leader Dalai Lama when he visits Denmark in February next year\\" In the autumn of 2015, Minister of Justice Søren Pind proclaimed the formation of a commission (colloquially, Tibetkommissionen) to investigate the events of the 2012 demonstration. In 2018, it was reported that \\"Anders Højmark Andersen, chairman of the Tibet Support Committee, is pleased to note that the Copenhagen Police believe that up to 200 people can claim compensation in the Tibetan case.

It was built in 1905 to a National Romantic design by Andreas Theil and decommissioned in 1972. History =Background= The waterworks at Mantziusvej The planning of a modern water supply and sewer system in Gentofte began when Niels Andersen became chairman of the parish council in 1888. The summer of 1897 was unusually hot and sunny and many wells in Hellerup. Bregnegård Waterworks opened at Mantziusvej in 1900 and so did Gentofte's first water tower at H. A. Clausensvej close to Gentofte Church. They supplied Hellerup, Skovshoved, Ordrup and Gentofte with water. The system reached Vangede in 1902 and Jægersborg in 1903. The water tower was designed by Johan Schröder. The water tank had a capacity of 432 cubic metres and the water surface was located 50 metres above sea level. The site where it was built was located 26 metres above sea level and had previously belonged to Gentofte Rectory. The water was led from six pumping stations to a collection well and from there through three sand filters to the water tower at H. A. Clausensvej. =The water tower at Ræveskovsvej= Ræveskovsvej Water Tower under construction The topping off ceremont photographed by Alfred Theodor Collin The completed water tower The population of Gentofte Municipality increased from 14,470 om 1901 to 20,709 in 1906. The growing population created a need for a second water tower. A site which comprised Rævebakken, a 36m tall hill located circa 500 to the northeast of Vangede, was therefore acquired from the Brogården estate in 1904. The water tower was built in 1905. It was designed by the architect Andreas Thejll with collaboration with Asger Ostenfeld. Ermelunden Waterworks, a second waterworks, opened in 1907. Sjælsø Waterworks was inaugurated in 1936. =Decommissioning= Gentofte Municipality's population peaked in 1952 at 89,142 and Tuborg Breweries increased its production increased dramatically, leading to new capacity problems for its water supply system. It was therefore decided to build a new and taller water tower at jægersborg station. Jægersborg Water Tower was inaugurated in 1956. The water tower at Ræveskovsvej was decommissioned in 1972. Descruption The entrance The tower is designed in the National Romantic style. The design is remniscient of that of the gunpowder magazine in Frederikshavn. It is built in reinforced concrete and stands on a foundation of boulders. The water tank has a capacity of just over 1,000 cubic metres and is supported by pillars. The windows are small and arched. Above the entrance is Gentofte's old coat of arms featuring three church bells as well as the year '1905'. The roof is finished by a small copper-clad spire with Weather vane. Just below the roof is a walkway.

Career Babandoa Etoa is a member of the Kinshasa Bar. She has worked as a magistrate and legal advisor to the Prime Minister's office. She was appointed Deputy General and the Chairperson of the Bas-Uele Railway Board. Odette Babandoa Etoa is the President of the UPR (Patriotic Union for the Republic, party presently in the opposition in the DRCongo). In 1999, she was appointed Minister of Transport and Communications by President Laurent-Désiré Kabila. In July 2000, Babandoa Etoa and her husband were arrested and accused of accepting bribes from a foreign country after meetings with senior Canadian government officials including David Kilgour and the awarding of a $41.5million contract to Quebec company Navigation Aeronav. However, the Canadian company denied any bribes had been offered, and others said she had been targeted for trying to expose corruption in Kabila's government. Three other ministers had been arrested in the preceding weeks. Babandoa Etoa was released a day after her arrest on 7 July, and then arrested again on 13 July and released on 21 July. Her husband was tried for \\"treason in war-time\\" for allowing journalists hostile to the regime to use his office. He was sentenced to one year in jail but was released on provisional bail in August 2000. Since her departure from government, Babandoa Etoa has served as President of the Forum of Women Lawyers. She spoke out against corruption and flaws in the 2006 electoral process.

It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. History Established in Jersey in 1988 to provide fiduciary services to private clients, Sanne started to work with corporate customers in 2003. Inflexion Private Equity supported Sanne's acquisition of State Street's corporate administration business and took a significant stake in Sanne in return for providing the funds in January 2013. Sanne was then the subject of an initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange in March 2015. However, it attracted some criticism because it secretly signed up shareholders before announcing the floatation. There was also some criticism that the company spent £11 million on the floatation. The company acquired Chartered Corporate Services, a Dublin-based business, in February 2016 and, more significantly, International Financial Services, a Mauritius-based business with $82 billion of assets under management, in December 2016. Then in September 2017, it bought Luxembourg Investment Solutions and Compliance Partners on an earn-out basis. The rising volume of regulation also drove expansion. Following these acquisitions and some subsequent organic expansion, the company's growth rate was described by Investors Chronicle in March 2018 as \\"explosive\\". The succession planning arrangements attracted some criticism when the departure of Dean Godwin as Chief Executive was announced in January 2019 just 12 months after Spencer Daley left his post as chief financial officer; the news unsettled the market, as Godwin and Daley had led the initial public offering, and the share price fell 18% in a day. In the wake of the Covid 19 pandemic, the company has benefited from customers focusing on the management of existing portfolios rather than new fund raising. Commentators suggested that the fact that the pandemic has so far had a minimal impact on client delivery made the company a \\"rare prospect of earnings resilience\\". Operations The company had £250 billion of assets under management as at 21 April 2020.

He studied both Indian and western music theory and published extensively on the topics. He founded the Bengal Music School and Bengal Academy of Music. A staunch supporter of the British Empire and its agencies in India, he was commissioned to set Indian translations of God Save the Queen to Indian tunes. Biography  Sourindro was the son of Hara Kumar Tagore and a younger brother of Jotindro Mohun Tagore belonging to the Pathuriaghata branch of the Tagore family. His family owned extensive lands including the battleground of Plassey and the pilgrimage site Ganga Sagar. He studied at the European-model Hindu College in Calcutta and took an interest in music, both Indian and western. He published a book on music at the age of fifteen, developed a system of musical notation for Indian music and set up the first Indian music orchestra in Calcutta. He collected musical instruments from India and donated many to museums across the world. He received an honorary Doctorate of Music from Philadelphia (1875) and Oxford (1895).  Music and writings  In 1877 the declaration of Queen Victoria as Empress of India led to the creation of the national anthem of \\"God Save the Queen\\". In 1882 a National Anthem Committee was created at the suggestion of Francis Harford. In 1883 he wrote On the Good That May Result to England and India from the Establishment of \\"God Save the Queen\\" as a National Anthem in Her Majesty's Eastern Empire. A translation of the wording of the anthem was made by Mirza Mohammed Bakir Khan of Bishop's College, Calcutta into Arabic and Persian. These were then further translated into many other Indian languages. The problem of singing the anthem in a style that would suit Indian musical taste was however vexing and the committee chose the foremost authority on Indian music to help- \\"a letter will immediately be forwarded to Dr. Sourindro Mohan Tagore, of Calcutta, the principal authority upon Hindu music, requesting him to secure the services of the best native composer, and a melody which shall at once suit Oriental taste and the measure of the translated hymn.\\" The idea was supported by others like Sir Henry Rawlinson. Sourindra Mohun produced no less than twelve different variations of the anthem based on lum jhijhiti, behag and nagara kirtana styles. In one variant he chose rag sahana which he claimed was the \\"favourite melody of the Mahomedan Emperors of India.\\" Tagore also claimed that Indians always supported rule by Kings and he published a book, Hindu Loyalty, with extracts from old Sanskrit sources on the need for rule by Kings. He dedicated the book to Augustus Rivers Thompson and supported the ideas of Canon Harford that the anthem would help earn loyalty. It has been noted that a major motivation for Sourindra Mohun to work with the National Anthem Committee was to align his family and social group with that of the colonial rulers. He also set some poems by Lord Lytton to Indian tunes in A Few Lyrics Of Owen Meredith Set to Hindu Music, with Added Words and Signs Noting the Two-Part Form of the Tune in Hindustani Music and a Tal Pattern. He also published on The Caste System of the Hindus (1884) and noted its antiquity and justified its role in Indian society. Signature on book gifted by Tagore to Monier Williams Among Sourindra's published works was a translation of Kalidasa's Malavikagnimitra. He founded the Bengal Music School in 1871 and the Bengal Academy of Music in 1881. He was made Fellow of the University of Calcutta and a Companion of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire in 1880 apart from being given the title of Raja. He was decorated Knight Commander of the Royal Order of the Crown of Italy and several other Royal recognitions from Sweden, Netherlands, Wurtemberg and Austria. In 1877, he made an initiative to renew musical ties with Japan by sending three musical instruments to the Emperor Mutsuhito of the Meiji Era to help bring the musical traditions of two nations together. In 1884, in order to promote the interest in and study of Indian music in other countries, he donated numerous collections of Indian instruments to institutions in North America and Europe including the Royal College of Music, London. Tagore worked to establish an annual award at the College, the Tagore Gold Medal, which is still given to \\"the most generally deserving pupil(s)\\".
